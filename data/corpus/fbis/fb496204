<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Criminal-Accused Arkan Threatening </F>
With Ethnic Cleansing of Kosova"] 
  [Text] The Serbian gang leader, Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan, 
accused of war crimes and atrocities and wanted in 42 countries, 
in a press conference held Friday [29 April] in Prishtina, 
capital of the republic of Kosova, said that his "party" will be 
more present in Kosovo, and that it would be engaged in 
colonizing Kosova with Serbs. "Those refugees that lost 
everything they had in Croatia and Bosnia should be settled in 
Kosova," he said, adding that "this should be carried out with a 
simultaneous expulsion of some 700,000 Albanians to Albania." 
He emphasized that "Mr. Rugova should no longer be allowed to 
live in Serbia, therefore he must be deported to his alternate 
mother country, Albania." 
  A new citizenship law underway in the Serbian Parliament, he 
said, will enable this ethnic cleansing. 
  Speaking on the deployment of Serbian army forces near the 
Albanian border and the presence of American troops in Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
criminal-accused Arkan said "Serbs are never scared. [Word 
indistinct] will be cut off."

  [Text] Nikica Valentic, the prime minister of the Croatian 
Government, had talks with Edib Bukvic, deputy prime minister of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. Following their talks behind 
closed doors they talked to our reporter Maja Sever. 
  [Begin recording] [Sever] Mr Bukvic, I ask for a brief 
statement for Croatian TV. What is the reason behind your visit 
and the issues raised at your meeting? 
  [Bukvic] Well, the reason is clearly the implementation of 
the agreement on the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
resolving of the problems accumulated in the period of blockade 
between the two republics -- the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and the Republic of Croatia. Mr Valentic and I discussed how to 
solve some economic problems regarding ownership rights, 
communications, traffic, deposits, visas etc. I believe we are 
on the right path to solve these problems and there is a high 
degree of desire to solve the problems to mutual satisfaction. 
  [Sever] Mr Valentic, has any agreement been reached? 
  [Valentic] Mr Bukvic said we are dealing with the 
implementation of the economic aspect of the Washington 
agreement. Normalization has already started. It is of 
particular importance to have roads opened and to restart the 
flow of goods and people. I believe, in this respect, we have 
already taken the first steps. 
  It is a very important fact that we have agreed that we are 
going to speed up the work of the mixed economic commission, 
comprising representatives of Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
Iran -- something that was agreed in Teheran. Hence, firms from 
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina will be able to jointly approach 
third countries, particularly Islamic countries where 
large-scale investment projects are about to take place. Here 
we see a great chance for our firms, something that will, on the 
one hand, consolidate our relations and, on the other, 
consolidate the standing of both Croatian and Bosnia- 
Herzegovina firms. [end recording]

  [Text] Last night, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman had 
talks with Douglas Hogg, minister of state in the British 
Foreign Office. According to Hogg, the talks focussed on the 
negotating process between the Croatian Government and the local 
Serb authorities from the UN protected areas and the Washington 
agreement. Hogg emphasized that he and the Croatian president 
had not discussed the possibility of using external influence to 
resolve the issue of the UN protected areas. In Hogg's view, 
the London conference remained the most effective mechanism for 
reaching a solution.

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman yesterday sent a 
letter to Willy Claes, Belgian deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister. The message, conveyed by Janko Vranicani-Dobrinovic, 
Croatian ambassador to the Benelux countries, requests Belgium, 
as one of the members of the European Union's [EU] troika, to 
enlist EU support for Croatia's development, which would speed 
up the democratization process and help to gradually resolve the 
problem of Croatian territories under UN protection. 
  Minister Claes and Ambassador Vranicani-Dobrinovic also 
discussed the implementation of the Washington agreements 
between the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims. 
  The Croatian ambassador underlined Croatia's interest in 
concluding an agreement on trade and economic cooperation, 
protection of foreign investments, and double taxation. 
Vrnicani-Dobrinovic requested that Belgium ease or abolish 
visas for Croatian citizens and resolve the problem of workers 
employed by Croatian companies in Belgium.

  [Excerpts] The Croatian dinar's days are numbered. Croatia 
will be introducing its own currency on Statehood Day, 30 May. 
As you already know, this will be the kuna. The dinar will 
remain legal tender until 7 June, but converting it into the new 
currency will be possible until the end of the year. This was 
revealed to reporters this afternoon by National Bank Governor 
Pero Jurkovic. [passage omitted] 
  The replacement of the Croatian dinar by the new currency of 
the Republic of Croatia will be realized by knocking off three 
zeros, according to National Bank Deputy Governor Zdravko Rogic.

  [Text] The political department of the Croatian Defense 
Ministry has issued a statement expressing sincere regret over 
an incident that took place at a Croatian Rights Party [HSP] 
promotional event in Siroki Brijeg. The ministry also says it 
is surprised by the insinuation, which links the ministry with 
the incident. We condemn all forms of violence and firmly deny 
any association with the events the HSP leadership is trying to 
use to compromise the state leadership of the Republic of 
Croatia and its Defense Ministry. 
  The short time that it took the HSP to present the incident 
as an attack on the Washington agreement and to say who is to 
blame -- without any evidence -- clearly shows that this media 
campaign is politically motivated, aimed at presenting the 
Croatian policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina as war-mongering and 
duplicituous. We hope that the implementation, in the near 
future, of the agreement signed between the Croat and 
Bosniak-Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina will most 
effectively contradict all insinuation and slanders recently 
used to try to compromise the Defense Ministry and the Croatian 
leadership's policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says. 
  The HSP claims in a statement issued today that the 
authorities in Herzegovina have banned an HSP promotional event 
in Capljina. As it now expects the other scheduled events to be 
banned, the HSP tour in Herzegovina is now cancelled, the 
statement says among other things.

<F P=106> [Article by M.P.: "Rightism--Statehood"] </F>
  [Text] "We can free Croatia of the burden of fascism, but 
it is impermissible to say that we want to free it of the burden 
of Ustashism, because the meaning of Ustashism and Rightism is 
the creation of a Croatian state," said Ante Prkacin, member of 
the HSP [Croatian Rights Party] and Assembly deputy, at a formal 
forum that was organized by the HSP's Split branch on Saturday 
on the occasion of 10 April. Emphasizing that the NDH 
[Independent State of Croatia] had extraordinary significance 
for the Croatian people, which gained its own state after 830 
years, Prkacin emphasized that how 10 April was treated today 
was very important, because Croatia was in the most unfavorable 
position of all the newly independent states, since it 
controlled the least of its own territory, and to a considerable 
extent the international community was deciding its future. 
  "The key thing is whether Croatia will occupy a place among 
the countries of Western civilization, or whether it will stop 
half way and resemble the South American banana republics," said 
Prkacin, recalling that the NDH disappeared because of the new 
world order, but also because of the romanticism of the Croatian 
communists who are called antifascists today, and he emphasized 
that certain lessons should be learned from 10 April, because 
the NDH knew who its friends were and who its enemies were. 
  Tomislav Opacak, member of the HSP's Headquarters, presented 
a report on the subject of "The Truth About 10 April and the 
NDH," asserting that the NDH was the result of the will of the 
Croatian people, and not of Italy and Germany. "The Croatian 
people's struggle was a necessary defense," Opacak said, 
emphasizing that the Ustasha movement was not anti-Semitic, 
since there were Jews among high NDH officials, and he concluded 
the report with the words: "As long as there is no deed without 
a defect, we cannot blink over an action like the NDH and 10 
April."

<F P=106> [Interview with Major Marko Skejo, commander of the Sir </F>
Rafael Boban 9th HOS Battalion, by Damir Dukic; place and date 
not given: "Honorable and Ready for the Homeland!"] 
  [Text] At the time when I was appointed commander, 
there were the right hind of young people in the battalion, but 
also ones who could not adjust at all to the new rules. We drove 
those people out of the unit. There are no units like this 
within Croatia's AVNOJ [Antifascist Council for the National 
Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders, but the extremely good 13th 
Battalion is operating in Tomislavgrad. One HOS [Croatian 
Defense Forces] battalion is also doing excellent work in 
Sarajevo, in the city itself. It has been incorporated into the 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina there, and is fighting against the 
chetniks. My ambitions are not associated with the army. I was a 
businessman, and I will be again. It has been an extraordinary 
honor for me to make my contribution to the achievement of the 
independent state of Croatia. 
  Marko Skejo, commander of the 9th HOS Battalion, heads the 
only remaining complete unit from the numerous ones that were 
organized by the Croatian Rights Party [HSP] at the beginning of 
the patriotic war in 1991, under the common name of the HOS. It 
is not just that the 9th Battalion, under Skejo's command, has 
continued to exist; it has also been restructured and adapted in 
such a way that it fit completely into the Croatian Army, as a 
regular and highly valued unit. Major Marko Skejo himself has 
had a wartime career typical of most volunteers--from the 
reserve forces of the Interior Ministry and independent 
organizations in local communities, to a real army. 
  [Skejo] After the chetniks abandoned the Dracevac barracks 
in 
Split, we were told to go to the battlefield in the rear. I 
gathered 22 young volunteers, and as an HOS platoon, we left for 
the Drnis battlefield, where we joined the 4th Guards Brigade. 
After two months, around Christmas of 1991, the Fourth left that 
line, but we joined the 114th Brigade, and have remained with it 
to this very day. The four platoons of the 9th Battalion, 
however, were attached to the Fourth at its very formation, at 
the time when the battalion was commanded by Jozo Radanovic. 
  [Dukic] Then you were already part of the regular Croatian 
Army? 
  [Skejo] Naturally, the Sir Rafael Boban 9th Battalion, from 
its creation to this day, has been under the command of the 
Croatian Army's General Staff. We conducted ourselves mostly as 
part of the 114th Brigade, but we were not integrated, and 
instead we acted in platoons within various Croatian Army 
brigades on all the battlefields from Zadar, through Sibenik, 
Drnis, and Livno, all the way to Vinkovci, Vukovar, and Nijemac. 
A total of about 5,500 fighters passed through the battalion 
during that whole period. 
<H5>  Croatia in Miniature </H5>
  [Dukic] That is a considerable number of people. What is the 
reason for that? Was it easy to get into the battalion, and even 
easier to get out? 
  [Skejo] The battalion had three camps for training soldiers. 
When the war flared up, people were trained, they left the camps 
after one month, and they went to Zenica, Jajce, Travnik, 
Bugojno, wherever they were needed. 
  [Dukic] And where were the battalion's members from? 
  [Skejo] In the beginning they were primarily from the 
Split-Dalmatian parish, but afterwards from all parts of 
Croatia. Even now we have people from Varazdin, Osijek, people 
from the Sava basin in Bosnia, central Bosnia, Herzegovina, from 
Vinkovci, from all over. 
  [Dukic] When were you appointed the unit's commander? 
  [Skejo] On 1 July 1992. I immediately came up with the idea 
of uniting what had until then been a dispersed battalion. We 
came together, and since we were acting as part of the 114th 
Brigade, we left for the southern battlefield, complete for the 
first time. Some of the members who were used to operating with 
other units had doubts. Nevertheless, in that first assembly 
there were 130 of us, but afterwards the number increased 
significantly and continuously. 
  [Dukic] It is said that among the members of the battalion 
who were a bit wilder, unadjusted, you introduced order and 
discipline, disciplining them to an enviable level. 
  [Skejo] That is true, I demanded discipline and I still do. 
At the time when I was appointed commander, there were the right 
kind of young men in the battalion, but there were also ones who 
could not adjust to the new rules at all. We drove those people 
out of the unit, so today, for a considerable time now, we have 
had a cadre of fighters, professional soldiers, serious and 
familiar people who are honorable and "ready for the homeland." 
They are capable of performing their sacred duty of defending 
the homeland honorably and completely. 
<H5>  Counterintelligence Service Lies </H5>
  [Dukic] Is the battalion well organized today? 
  [Skejo] The unit's organization has been carried out in 
accordance with all the rules of the profession, with a 
well-developed system and sections consisting of infantry, 
artillery, missile launchers, reconnaissance specialists, and 
command personnel, and it is all functioning extremely well. We 
have also received praise, both individuals and the unit as a 
whole, for the missions carried out in the Zadar rear. In any 
case our results throughout this war have been great, and 
everything that the battalion did was done on the battlefield 
and in operation against enemy military targets. 
  [Dukic] Members of the HOS, and thus also the 9th Battalion, 
however, have often been criticized for brutality, action 
against civilians, and harsh words have even been heard about 
crimes that have been committed. 
  [Skejo] By no means, not in any case. We have never acted 
against civilian targets, and I can substantiate that. It is not 
in order to characterize these fighters as undesirables, 
extremists, or butchers, because they are real sons of Croatia 
who only attacked military targets under orders, and I am proud 
of those guys. 
  [Dukic] All right, but why have you, as a unit, gained that 
reputation? 
  [Skejo] The Counterintelligence Service [KOS] is still 
functioning well in all of this; it wants to have a pretext for 
Serbian crimes, and furthermore, it wants to portray us and 
convince the Croatian Army headquarters and General Staff that 
we are damaging to Croatian interests and that we do not deserve 
to be called honorable soldiers, all of which is not true. Those 
are all lies in the interests of structures that still cannot 
accept the existence of the Croatian state. 
<H5>  The Typhoon Passes </H5>
  [Dukic] Can you say that your battalion has "done" its 
wartime job thoroughly? 
  [Skejo] Yes. When an operation starts, then there is no 
haggling like in the marketplace: I'll do this, I won't do that, 
and instead it happens, the typhoon passes. It is possible that 
some civilian may also suffer in that onslaught, but not 
deliberately, but rather because battles are being fought. If 
the chetniks are in three houses, who can guarantee that they 
are not in a fourth one, and who will review all the details 
then? There is no giving up then. Either you fight as you have 
to, or you don't start. 
  [Dukic] During 1992, the HOS units mostly collapsed. Has any 
other such unit been preserved besides yours? 
  [Skejo] There are no longer any such units within Croatia's 
AVNOJ borders. The 13th Battalion is operating extremely well in 
Tomislavgrad, however. One battalion is also doing excellent 
work in Sarajevo, in the city itself. It has been incorporated 
into the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina there, and it is fighting 
against the chetniks. There is nothing surprising about that, 
because we and the Muslims are capable of defeating our common 
enemy and breaking through to our borders. In any case, we have 
always adhered to the military hierarchy, instructions, and 
orders, being careful not to harm Croatian policy and state 
interests. 
  [Dukic] How many casualties has the unit had during the war? 
  [Skejo] Since I have been commander, we have lost seven 
soldiers, but the battalion has had a total of 43 dead and more 
than 200 wounded. Nothing is known yet, however, about some of 
our members, especially those who left for Bosnia, and they are 
being treated as missing in action. I must say that the status 
of the families of the casualties, the wounded, and the other 
troops has been effectively resolved within the framework of the 
Croatian Army. 
<H5>  I Don't Shout "To the Drina" </H5>
  [Dukic] It seems that the war is approaching its end. How 
will it all be completely resolved? 
  [Skejo] I think that the chetniks will not withdraw just 
like 
that. Whatever happens, we are ready to do our job at any time, 
whenever it is ordered by the Croatian Army's commander in chief 
and the General Staff. Our original enthusiasm has not waned, 
and if we are given an order, if we are unleashed, the chetniks 
will not know where to flee. We have already asked for that, but 
we have not been allowed. 
  [Dukic] If the war is resumed, then, the chetniks would give 
way. What would be the outcome of a clash between the 9th 
Battalion and one of the Serbian units that they call special 
ones, for example? 
  [Skejo] I never underestimate the enemy soldiers, but we do 
not have any fear of "Captain Dragan's" special forces, or any 
of Arkan's or Seselj's people, and so forth. We are always ready 
to engage in conflict with anyone. We have been and will always 
be eager to encounter those units. They have already had 
opportunities to encounter the 9th Battalion, and so they know 
quite well who and what we are. 
  [Dukic] What awaits the members of the 9th Battalion in the 
event of a peaceful outcome? 
  [Skejo] I have been promised that their status will be 
completely straightened out; they will be allowed to remain in 
the Croatian Army, get further training.... 
  [Dukic] How do you see your own future? 
  [Skejo] My ambitions are not associated with the army. I was 
a businessman, and I will be again. It has been an extraordinary 
honor for me, however, to make my contribution to achieving the 
independent state of Croatia. 
  [Dukic] Does that mean that with the peaceful integration of 
the occupied areas, your dream would be fulfilled? 
  [Skejo] I am not one of the people who are shouting "To the 
Drina" in the present situation, but I still maintain that our 
historical borders are much larger than the present ones. Our 
leadership, headed by Dr. Franjo Tudjman, has made it possible 
for us to fight for our state, however. For the time being I 
support liberating the territory up to the AVNOJ borders, and 
afterwards, we will see. I would not cross the Drina, but I will 
always go up to it. 
<H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>
  [Skejo] Croatian soldiers who are of the Muslim religion 
have 
fought in our unit from the first day to this very day, shoulder 
to shoulder with the Catholics. They have not been neglected or 
belittled at any time because of the conflicts in Herceg-Bosna 
between the Croats and Muslims; and the 9th Battalion would 
never fight the Muslims, or participate in a battle with them 
even if it were by some chance asked to do so. 
<H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>
<H5>  Break-ins Into Apartments </H5>
  [Skejo] About a thousand military apartments have been 
broken 
into in Split, but a fuss is always raised when a member of the 
9th Battalion is involved. That means that someone is carefully 
watching us and immediately publicizes every faux pas in order 
to slander us. It is well known who is keeping track of that and 
who does not like us. They are anti-Croats with a five-pointed 
star in their pockets who have been allowed to operate again. 
Now they are also slandering real sons of Croatia, serious 
invalids, casting their patriotism and morale under their feet. 
  [Dukic] But isn't the state obligated to protect law and 
order? 
  [Skejo] I ask you--these are cases in which soldiers without 
legs or arms or those who have been blinded on the battlefield 
enter a chetnik apartment whose owners have bloodied their hands 
and are on the opposing side. Such people are being protected 
again. You know, we are not skilled in legal and bureaucratic 
difficulties; we are more skilled at shooting. The Croatian 
Army's real commanders, especially Brigadier Ante Gotovina, know 
quite well what kind of soldiers we are, and thanks to him we 
have solved many problems. It is time, however, for petty 
political games to stop revolving around us; people should start 
to tell the truth, sincerely and honestly. I hope that 
responsible people will finally realize this and allow us to 
straighten out the status and rights that all Croatian soldiers 
have. Nothing more! We cannot be illegals in our own country, 
while JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] officers and chetniks enjoy 
privileges in the state for which we have died and shed our 
blood.

<F P=106> [Article by S.Lj.: "9th Battalion From All the Battlefields"] </F>
  [Text] Ante Prkacin, Assembly deputy and member of 
the HSP [Croatian Rights Party] Headquarters, and Major General 
Mate Sarlija Daidza were present at the formal review of the 9th 
Battalion of the 114th Brigade. 
  "It is an extraordinary honor for me to welcome the best 
sons 
of Croatia on behalf of the HSP's Headquarters and to 
congratulate you on the third anniversary of your founding and 
combat activity," said Assembly deputy Ante Prkacin on the 
occasion of the formal commemoration of the third anniversary of 
the founding of the Sir Rafael Boban 9th Battalion of the 114th 
Brigade on Sunday at the Visoka barracks. 
  Later in his speech, Prkacin spoke about the unfavorable 
external and internal reasons that led to the collapse of the 
NDH [Independent State of Croatia], emphasizing that at that 
time the Croatian people was not as cohesive and homogeneous as 
today in fulfilling the Croatian state, but the leadership at 
that time was well aware who the enemies of the Croatian people 
were, creating a strong anti-Serbian front from members of the 
Croatian and Muslim population, ready to give their own lives 
for freedom. 
  The members of the 9th Battalion were also congratulated on 
the third anniversary of the founding of the Sir Rafael Boban 
battalion by the commander, Major Marko Skejo, Major General 
Mate Sarlija Daidza, and Mate Gotovac, president of the HSP's 
Kastelanec branch. Major Marko Skejo emphasized that the members 
of the Sir Rafael Boban battalion had fought bravely throughout 
Croatia, and commented that the heroic unit had more dead and 
wounded than some entire Croatian parishes. 
  "The families of the dead are therefore sacred to us, and 
our 
concern for them must never cease," Skejo said, adding that the 
members of the HOS [Croatian Defense Forces] were precisely the 
ones who had frightened the Greater-Serbian enemy the most with 
their courage, and put an end to Yugoslavia and communism. 
Finally, Skejo emphasized that the motives of the grandfathers 
and fathers who had once fought for Croatia, and the motives of 
their sons, were completely identical, namely love for their 
homeland, and he warned that cheap political games could not be 
played with respect to members of the HOS, and demanded the same 
status for all Croatian defenders who rose in defense of our 
homeland. 
  A review of the Sir Rafael Boban 9th Battalion was also 
conducted at the Visoka barracks, with the anthem "Lijepa nasa" 
being sung, and deputy commander Mice Cuk presented a report to 
the battalion's commander, Major Marko Skejo. Finally, 
refreshments were arranged, and thanks were expressed to the 
members of the Sir Rafael Boban battalion.

<F P=106> [Article by Miomir Strbac: "Transformation Conflict in 120 </F>
Pictures"] 
  [Text] The Privatization Fund's right to increase the 
value of its principal and the buyer's ownership package by 
approving additional capitalization of enterprises is viewed by 
small shareholders as robbery, and by the presidents of 
commercial courts as "a flagrant violation of rights," but the 
fund retorts that "they are interpreting the law in a hostile 
manner and undermining the state." The dispute over additional 
capitalization, which was sparked by the case of Split's Dairy, 
is currently before the Constitutional Court, and 120 buyers are 
in doubt as to whether what they have bought will be granted 
them. 
  The case is called U-171/94, and it is just now in the 
process of being resolved by the Constitutional Court. The 
problem that is being dealt with within the covers of the 
documents with that designation, in dry lawyers' language, is 
designated as "additional capitalization--entry in the 
registry." In practice, however, during discussions of that same 
subject completely different expressions are being used, and 
thus some people are talking about theft and robbery, others 
about a flagrant violation of the rights of small shareholders, 
and yet others think that the statements of the former (and to 
some extent the latter) are "a hostile interpretation of the law 
equivalent to destruction of the state." 
  Just the harsh words used in those verbal clashes indicate 
that this is a hot dispute, and when it also turns out that the 
"former" are small shareholders (and a large number of ordinary 
citizens), the "latter" are the presidents of Croatia's 
commercial courts, and the "yet others" are the Croatian 
Privatization Fund, it is clear why the entire problem has been 
transferred to the Constitutional Court, before too much of a 
public hue and cry could be raised and before teams of 
supporters could be formed. 
<H5>  From Disputes to Arrests </H5>
  Nevertheless, while the constitutional judges, in the peace 
of the country's highest judicial institution, are leafing 
through and analyzing the materials they have received, the 
polemics, nervousness, and conflicts outside of that court 
building have not stopped. Furthermore, one of the incidents 
that have emerged in the dispute over the case of "additional 
capitalization--entry in the registry," namely Split's Dairy, 
resulted a few days ago in the arrest of the protagonists of 
that additional capitalization, Sinisa Caktas, Ivo Cecuk, and 
Ferri Toth, with an uncertain outcome. At the same time, as many 
as approximately 120 transformations in Croatia have been 
completed following the model over which the "constitutional 
war" has been started, and so now a big question mark is written 
over each of them. Let us go in order, then. 
  Everything started back in February 1993, when amendments to 
the Law on Transformation restricted the right of employees and 
other privileged groups to purchase shares to 50 percent of the 
assessed value of an enterprise. The Privatization Fund, to 
which the rest of the shares were required to be transferred, 
however, was given the right to sell them to the highest bidder 
after publishing a public advertisement for that purpose. Sales 
of shares following that model started in mid-1993, and as a 
rule the bidders, along with buying an offered package of shares 
in a given enterprise, also offered additional capitalization in 
varying amounts. At that time such an arrangement seemed 
indisputably good and desirable, both from the standpoint of the 
buyer of the shares, the Privatization Fund (and thus the 
state), and probably also the small shareholders. 
  In fact, it turned out, logically, that investors are not 
willing to invest hundreds of thousands or millions of German 
marks [DM] in shares in any enterprise without obtaining a 
majority ownership and management package. That was ensured 
precisely through additional capitalization, which increased the 
firm's capital and expanded the shareholder stock, which was 50 
percent larger in the buyer's hands. As far as the state is 
concerned, its calculation was that additional capitalization 
meant fresh capital that would help restructuring, modernizing, 
and developing the firms sold, and would accelerate desirable 
privatization. For the same reason, employees were supposed to 
believe that additional capitalization and privatization would 
bring them new economic vitality, a more certain future, and 
higher wages. 
<H5>  The Shareholders Do Not Believe It </H5>
  We say "were supposed to believe" because it soon turned out 
that at some enterprises the small shareholders, above all, 
believe that through the decision on additional capitalization 
of their firm without their consent, the fund was unfairly 
seizing control over the enterprise and their own fate out of 
their hands, and leaving them at the mercy of a private 
businessman who, as he saw fit, could declare them surplus, 
dismiss them, pay them badly, or disband and sell off "their" 
enterprise. Those are the cries with which the first protests 
began--i.e., at the level of raising an uproar over justice and 
robbery--and since they began very soon to embrace ideas about 
the Privatization Fund's illegal action and arbitrary action in 
all this, the fund decided to protect itself. At the end of last 
year, without any opposition whatsoever from the Assembly 
deputies, it proposed and obtained an amendment to the Law on 
Transformation that authorized it to increase, by its own 
decision, the principal of an enterprise being transformed into 
a stock company by the amount of additional capitalization that 
was accepted. It seemed that everything was now all right, as 
least as far as the legal aspect was concerned. 
  As ill luck would have it, the Zagreb enterprise Pismorad 
appealed to the Croatian Constitutional Court to investigate the 
legality of that legal authorization for the fund, and then the 
presidents of all the commercial courts in Croatia met in Zagreb 
on 9 February. This was, therefore, a group that from the legal 
standpoint can discuss very authoritatively a subject like 
"additional capitalization--entry in the registry." On 11 
February Vladimir Gusin, president of the High Commercial Court, 
sent the conclusions from that meeting to all subordinate 
courts, with instructions to inform all judges and employees at 
court registries with them, but also the Croatian Constitutional 
Court, the government, the Ministry of Justice, the Assembly, 
the Public Legal Defender, the Privatization Fund.... 
  In those conclusions, analyzing the legal provision that 
allows the Privatization Fund, by its own decision, to increase 
the principal of an enterprise in the process of transformation 
by the amount of the additional capitalization accepted, the 
presidents of the commercial courts also say the following: 
"This provision of the Law on the Transformation of Socialized 
Enterprises is in direct violation of the provision in article 
49, paragraph 4 of the Croatian Constitution, which says, 
`Rights acquired through the investment of capital cannot be 
reduced by law or any other legal act,' as well as the provision 
of article 48, paragraph 1, which guarantees ownership rights. 
By applying the disputed provision of the Law on Transformation, 
the Croatian Privatization Fund is flagrantly violating the 
shareholders' rights, since by converting the additional 
capitalization proposed into additional shares, it is depriving 
the other shareholders of the right to participate in additional 
capitalization, and proportionately reducing the other 
shareholders' already acquired rights and the amount of their 
investments." 
  The consequences are also explained using the example of a 
firm where small shareholders have acquired 50 percent of the 
shares and management rights, but when the fund sells the rest 
of the shares and the buyer accepts additional capitalization, 
"not following the procedure in the Law on Commercial Companies 
and the means of additional capitalization regulated by the 
company's charter, he acquires majority rights, and what happens 
in practice is that he replaces management bodies, decides on 
dismissing workers, and so forth." 
<H5>  Illusion of Fresh Money </H5>
  The presidents of the commercial courts also took the 
position that the claim that additional capitalization brings 
"fresh blood," i.e., fresh money, into the economy is 
unacceptable, and "an illusion for the uninformed," because in 
the vast majority of cases the funds for additional 
capitalization come from loans from domestic banks, and thus 
that represents merely a transfer of existing capital, and not 
an infusion of new capital. "For the above-mentioned reasons, we 
are pointing out to the registry courts that any entry of 
additional capitalization carried out in that manner is 
unconstitutional and illegal, and we recommend delaying entries 
in the manner described until these issues are discussed at the 
proper level." 
  It was not necessary to wait long for the fund's reaction. 
It 
was sent in the form of an extensive letter signed by the fund's 
president, Ivan Penic, as soon as 25 February, to the same 
addressees as the positions of the commercial court presidents. 
The fund, naturally, rejects all the judges' ideas, and there 
are two key postulates in its arguments. The first is that the 
purchase of preferred shares (up to DM 20,000), limited to 50 
percent of the enterprise's value, is not a collective right of 
the small shareholders, but rather the personal right of each of 
them, which remains equally even after additional 
capitalization. The second one is the postulate that the fund, 
by accepting additional capitalization, is increasing the 
enterprise's principal before the completion of the 
transformation, "when a stock company has not been founded, and 
thus one cannot consider the criticism about a flagrant 
violation of the shareholders' rights, since while there is no 
stock company, while it has not been entered in the court 
register, there is also no shareholder status; instead, this is 
a process of transition in accordance with the provisions of the 
Law on Transformation." 
<H5>  The Fund Strikes Back </H5>
  In the conclusion of the letter, the fund also recommended 
to 
the commercial judges that before uttering bold assertions about 
unconstitutionality and illegality, they could discuss disputed 
issues at the level of the competent state authorities, and that 
they were obligated to apply the law with which they disagreed 
until the Constitutional Court, possibly, thought differently. 
  In the end, on 28 February the whole problem reached a 
meeting of the government, after which the president of the High 
Commercial Court instructed all the lower courts to resume the 
blocked entries of enterprises with additional capitalization in 
the registry, since "in the event of abuse there is the 
possibility of intervening by deleting those entries." 
  Thus, this is how things currently stand (entangled and 
confusing, to say the least) with the case of "additional 
capitalization--entry in the registry" at the level of the state 
authorities. And in real life? Even worse, because it has been 
possible for months now to buy shares from the Privatization 
Fund and obtain additional capitalization, spending around DM1 
million, without any problem. Legally, however, sometimes it is 
possible to regularize such a transaction by entering its 
results in the court registry, and sometimes it is not. There 
have also been situations in which it is possible in some 
places, but not in others (at the time when the Split Commercial 
Court was refusing to register the "additionally capitalized" 
Dairy, the Zagreb courts consistently registered identical 
cases). The worst thing of all, however, is that the buyer, 
whether he has registered the additionally capitalized 
enterprise or not, still has hanging over his head the sword of 
Damocles of the possibility that his arrangement with the fund 
(as we have said, so far about 120 of them have been concluded) 
might be declared unconstitutional. Then, once again, even 
though he claims complete innocence, he will suffer, because 
overnight he will lose what he bought. 
<H5>  Small Shareholders Keeping Quiet </H5>
  It is not difficult to judge how much that kind of "legal 
security" of privatization here is a "good advertisement" for 
potential investors to loosen their purse-strings. The 
Privatization Fund nevertheless seems to be sure of itself: 
Without any doubt whatsoever in the outcome of constitutional 
case U-171, it is continuing official announcements of the sale 
of shares and additional capitalization under the terms in the 
controversial articles of the Law on Transformation, 
guaranteeing the buyers ownership rights and court registration. 
The problem, however, is that the fund, no matter how 
self-confident it is, cannot give anyone a guarantee of what the 
Constitutional Court's decision will be, and so its guarantee 
that the enterprises will be registered is shaky. And the small 
shareholders? For the time being they are mostly keeping quiet, 
awaiting the Constitutional Court's verdict. It does not matter 
whether they are doing so because of a headache from 
confrontation with the legal labyrinth in which nothing is clear 
to them anymore, or because everything is clear to them, and so 
their heads ache from helplessness.

  [Text] Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy said at a meeting with 
workers at the Warsaw FSO [Automobile Factory] today that, by 
organizing strikes, Solidarity is not fighting in the interest 
of employees but is seeking to achieve the upper hand over other 
trade unions. According to the speaker, Solidarity has been 
deliberately avoiding negotiations with the government. It has 
announced the escalation of strike action because the aim of the 
union is to overthrow Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet. 
  Jozef Oleksy said that trade unions should primarily fight 
to 
resolve problems of employees and not play political games for 
their own benefit.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leszek Miller, minister of labor and social </F>
policy, by correspondent Henryk Sroczynski; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Sroczynski] Why, in your opinion, do strikes keep 
recurring in the raw materials, fuels, and power-generating 
sectors? 
  [Miller] A strike in a textile plant or even in the whole 
textile sector would not bring appreciable results for its 
organizers. After all, they are interested in making their 
cause heard. Therefore, notoriety can be gained only through a 
strike that will affect coal mines, power plants, or the 
telecommunications sector because it can paralyze life in the 
country on a large scale. Thus, organizers will always select 
the branches of industry in which the planned strike would, 
first, be noticed. and, second, have a crippling effect on the 
whole fabric of state life. 
  [Sroczynski] In this case, however, there is much talk of 
the exceptional significance of the strikes and even of a "new 
gust of air" that might inflame Solidarity again. 
  [Miller] That would be impossible in any circumstances now. 
Today we have a completely different management and ownership 
structure than we had in the 1980's. Nevertheless, Solidarity 
will clearly continue to provoke strikes in order to give itself 
a high profile, at all costs, and to paralyze many other 
branches of the economy. 
  [Sroczynski] In the meantime, how do you assess the 
condition of our economy? 
  [Miller] For the first time in a long while, we have a 
decrease in the number of unemployed: It has gone down by 
20,000. This may not be very much, but it is a heartening 
indication that unemployment is no longer growing. The 
inflation index for the first quarter of the year is 4.5 
percent, which is the best result for the past seven years. In 
addition, industrial output rose by 10 percent in the past 
quarter, which is also an unusual thing. 
  [Sroczynski] Can we assume that this will be a permanent 
trend? 
  [Miller] It seems so, but this optimistic outlook can be 
easily shattered nowadays. This can happen as a result of the 
strike wave that may hit at the economy's sensitive points or 
the abolition of the popiwek [enterprise tax on above-normative 
pay] act, which could cause rapid wage increases. In such a 
situation, Poland could again become an unstable country. 
  [Sroczynski] When could the economic reforms bring tangible 
advantages also to the poorest strata of society? 
  [Miller] If the advantageous trends I mentioned earlier 
prove to be the dominant strands in the economy, a real growth 
of wages as well as old-age and disability pensions could take 
place for the first time in many years. The most important 
aspect of that would be that the adverse trends would then be 
halted for the first time in many years.

<F P=106> [Address by President Lech Walesa at a ceremony at the Tomb </F>
of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw marking the anniversary of 
Poland's 1791 Constitution--live] 
  [Text] The event whose anniversary we are celebrating today 
is among the most important and glorious in Polish history. 
Although it was a fruit of peaceful thinking, this event is 
equal in importance to our greatest military achievements, the 
most famous victories of the Polish Army. On 3 May 1791, an 
important and difficult battle was won in Warsaw, a battle for 
Poland and for a modern Polish state. Patriotic, progressive, 
and reformatory thinking won the battle. It changed, meeting 
the needs of its time, the unsatisfactory political and social 
setup of the state. However, internal arguments and foreign 
forces destroyed the achievements this philosophy had initiated. 
But the beautiful tradition that stimulated the minds and 
spirit of subsequent generations of Poles has remained. 
  The adoption of the 3 May Constitution has proved that, at 
important moments of history, we are capable of courageous and 
long-term state thinking, that we are capable of initiating 
radical reforms and of creating solid legal foundations for 
actions organized on a national scale. Social agreement and 
universal consent are the condition for such transformations to 
be successful. This puts reformers under the obligation to make 
great efforts in order to bring about pluralistic compromise 
solutions. 
  For society, this means an even more difficult task of 
finding appropriate proportions between one's own good and 
public interest, of giving up some personal objectives for the 
common good. 
  The message of the 3 May Constitution constitutes a living 
and creative value for Poles today. We remembered this during 
our struggles for a free and sovereign Third Republic aimed at 
transforming Poland into a strong, modern, democratic and 
tolerant country, a country that would be open to the world. We 
feel that this Polish tradition is part of our legacy. However, 
today we lack the determination and effectiveness of our great 
predecessors. The Basic Law of the Third Republic is still 
nonexistent. Despite the restructuring of the state continuing 
for five years, this basic legal act has not yet been created. 
We are building a house without a solid foundation. 
  A year ago, on the 202d anniversary of the 3 May 
Constitution, I said here: It will be easier to meet new 
challenges if we focus on what unites us all. The achievement 
of the authors of the 3 May Constitution should be an example 
for us to follow. They overcame divisions and rose above their 
ambitions and grudges. They showed us what civic maturity, 
responsibility and patriotism, tolerance and wise consensus mean. 
  We are in great need of these values today. We must reach an 
agreement on matters most important to our homeland. 
Irrespective of the fact that our views, options, and interests 
vary, we must support Poland through a wise and long-sighted 
compromise. The future successful development of the country 
and the well-being of its citizens depend on that. The 
endurance of the edifice of the state depends on it. 
  These words are still topical. We are still divided. We 
have not managed to form a united stance on matters important 
for the country or to give a clear answer to questions on the 
future of the state. The matter most important for Poland--the 
Constitution--is buried in insignificant and prolonged 
discussions and arguments. 
  Despite this, I believe that we will find a common language 
and citizens' concern for our common value--Poland. I believe 
that this exchange of opinions will allow creative thought about 
the state to emerge, and this will introduce a new democratic 
order that will live up to our dreams and aspirations. It will 
live up to the time in which we are living. Let us be worthy 
successors to the tradition of 3 May. [Applause]

Leszek Wasiuta to mark Constitution Day on 3 May; place not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Wasiuta] Mr. President, we celebrated Emigres' Day 
yesterday. Would you ever think of emigrating? 
  [Walesa] No, I never took such a possibility into account. 
There is always a chance things can be improved. 
  [Wasiuta] But in the past you were pressed to leave the 
country, right? 
  [Walesa] And that is why nobody ever succeeded in doing that 
and never will [as heard]. 
  [Wasiuta] Recently, more and more young and educated people 
have left Poland. They emigrate. They are leaving for reasons 
different from those common during communism, but this makes 
Poland a poorer country. What do you think about it? 
  [Walesa] Well, here one can see the difference between 
generations. My own generation was to some extent educated by 
teachers who had themselves lived during the Second Republic, 
where the homeland was more important than anything else, 
regardless of the costs of living here. Now we talk about being 
Europeans. We say that this country opens up, that efforts to 
stress differences do not make much sense. This induces young 
people brought up this way to look for places where life is 
better, where they can get more. 
  [Wasiuta] What is wrong with that? 
  [Walesa] Well, it is happening at a bad time because the 
country needs to catch up with Europe as quickly as possible. 
It needs solutions because it is behind a little. If more 
valuable people leave, this is a loss for the country. Of 
course, later, after a hundred or so years, this loss will be 
compensated for, but it means that our chances to catch up with 
the world are reduced. 
  [Wasiuta] A hundred years is a long time. Mr. President, 
today we are celebrating the 3 May Constitution. This is a 
celebration for those who never accepted Poland's loss of 
sovereignty, national dignity, and independence. Do you think 
those people have won the battle? 
  [Walesa] Yes and no. Again one should ask how one can win, 
how one can build up patriotism or take care of the nation, of 
the state, when this state is Europe or, rather, the fact that 
we are striving for Europe. That is why certain things will 
have to be reevaluated. I think that certainly in 200 years 
Poland and other countries will differ from one another only in 
their folklore and past history, but we will really be one 
Europe. Whether this will be better or worse, who knows? But 
that is what we are striving for. 
  [Wasiuta] Mr. President, after the signing of the treaty in 
Vilnius, the Polonia, or the Polish minorities in Lithuania and 
other neighboring countries, have had their rights guaranteed, 
but there are countries where the Polish minorities do not have 
such guaranteed rights, and these people look longingly at 
Warsaw and at you, Mr. President. What can be done in this 
regard for Kazakhstan, for instance? 
  [Walesa] Of course, we must make every effort to make sure 
that people of Polish origin, wherever they live, can enjoy 
similar solutions, but this depends not only on their mother 
country, but also on the countries they live in. When we reach 
European living standards, this will not constitute a great 
problem, but now there are still big differences, both economic 
and political, and, as regards security, so the problem lies in 
the differences in levels, and efforts will have to be made to 
keep a careful watch on places where the principles worked out 
by Europe are not observed. And, of course, in extreme cases, 
we will help people return, although, as I say, in an open 
pluralistic Europe, the same goal may be reached from different 
points, and there is no need for massive translocations when 
borders are open. They are necessary, and people aim for that, 
but only when differences in living standards are very big, in 
fact [sentence as heard]. 
  [Wasiuta] Mr. President, as I have already said, the Polonia 
throughout the world looks at Warsaw with expectation and at 
you, Mr. President, also with hope. They expect to get moral 
support. They look at what is happening in Poland from a 
specific point of view. What can Poland, a country still on its 
way to prosperity, offer the Polonia today? 
  [Walesa] As you have said yourself, the Polonia is different 
in every country. There is a Polonia that would like to do 
business because it has the money, and there is a Polonia that 
would like to make money out of the mother country because it 
has no money. So, they are terribly different. One should 
divide them logically into three groups, and, depending on the 
groups, on the different levels, they ought to be dealt with 
accordingly. The rich Polonia should be dealt with in a 
different way, they should be given a chance to do good business 
here, while the other Polonia, the older one, should be dealt 
with in a different manner, rather like tourists: They ought to 
be shown things. And the rich Polonia that would like to make 
money doing business with Poland should be treated differently. 
  At present, we do not do enough in this respect, we do not 
show enough interest in these matters, but I want to say, too, 
that, while we are setting our country in order economically, 
politically, and socially, we will have more and more time to 
deal with other matters. That is bad because it could be the 
other way around: First set the country in order, and then it 
would be easier to do the reforms. Yes, but we have approached 
the problem from another direction, and that is why we do not 
have good contacts and do not take proper care of the Polonia. 
But, if the Polonia--for the ball can be returned a different 
way--if the Polonia organized itself better and forced certain 
solutions on its mother country, that would suit us much better. 
But the question again is, which Polonia? The one that expects 
something or the one that can do something? 
  [Wasiuta] And from which we also expect support. Thank you 
very much for the conversation, Mr. President. 
  [Walesa] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Article by Wieslaw Debski: "In Line to Diplomatic Corps"] </F>
  [Text] 
<H5>  MSZ Open to Coalition Members </H5>
  Andrzej Olechowski, at a closed meeting of the Sejm 
Commission on Foreign Affairs on Thursday, presented some plans 
for modernizing the Foreign Affairs Ministry (MSZ). 
  After the meeting, the minister informed the journalists 
that 
he was speaking about the problems of coordinating the 
activities of Polish diplomacy and the ministry's new cadre 
policy. In the law on foreign service, the draft of which is 
already prepared, there is mention of the Diplomatic Service 
Corps and the political leadership of the ministry. The latter 
is to be made up of the minister and his deputy, representing 
the groups that form the government. The minister believes they 
should have influence on the shaping of the state's foreign 
policy. 
  Olechowski stated that the road to bringing coalition deputy 
ministers into the MSZ has been opened up in this way. When 
asked by TRYBUNA when, therefore, the shaping of an MSZ 
political leadership could be expected, he replied that this 
will be one of the more important elements in the first stage of 
modernization, which will be completed no later than 1 July 1994. 
  The commission, for the first time in the present term, 
pronounced its opinion on candidates for ambassadorships. It 
approved Jerzy Kozminski (deputy minister of foreign affairs) to 
the post of ambassador in one of the countries on the American 
continent. Favorable opinions were also passed on Ryszard 
Stemplowski (former chief of the Sejm Chancellery) and Wictor 
Ross (diplomat in the Polish Embassy in Moscow), also being 
considered for ambassadorships in European countries. 
  There was no agreement (one vote was lacking) on extending 
the work of the subcommittee on cadre evaluation in the MSZ, 
but, as one of the deputies told us, this motion will shortly 
return to the commission for deliberation. 
<H5>  In Line to Diplomatic Corps </H5>
  Personnel matters in Polish diplomacy have always been a hot 
topic. The diplomatic service was the "jar of goodies" many 
people in authority were eager to reach for. It was charged that 
the diplomacy of real socialism was a stepping-stone for the 
party aktiv. The diplomacy of the new capitalism, on the other 
hand, is being accused of allowing entry only to its "friends 
who are on the list." It is not surprising, therefore, that 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski suggested, as one of the first 
tasks, that new rules of selection for the diplomatic service be 
prepared. 
  Let us mention that, during the first six months of the 
MSZ's 
work under new leadership, a concept of broad and accelerated 
entry into the Western structures (the European Union, on the 
one hand, and NATO and WEU on the other) and the assumptions of 
Eastern policy were developed. The plan for modernizing the 
ministry, whose cadre matters constitute an important element, 
is another stage in the formulation of a concept of Polish 
foreign policy and how it is to be implemented. 
  As learned from people participating in the closed meeting 
of 
the Sejm Committee on Foreign Affairs and in the corridors of 
the MSZ building, a four-person group worked on this concept, 
enhanced by 17 task forces that prepared five basic courses of 
change, covering: 

  -  External coordination of foreign policy (relationships: 
president, MSZ, government, parliament, etc.). 
  -  The 
organizational structure of the Foreign Affairs Ministry (it 
seems that a completely new system of departments is being 
proposed). 
  -  Internal coordination (in the MSZ home office, home 
office and foreign posts). 
  -  The shaping of professional cadres in 
the ministry. 
  -  Technical and material infrastructure. 
  The basis for cadre reform will be the law on foreign 
service, the draft of which will shortly be sent to the 
government for deliberation and, if accepted, sent to the Sejm. 
  Therefore, we should soon have a diplomatic service corps, a 
group of people who are well trained, suitably prepared, and 
proven in practice. It is they who will constitute the main 
(some say 90 percent, others 70 percent) group of ministry 
employees and diplomats in foreign posts. For this to happen, 
clearly defined rules for the acceptance of employees must be 
established (e.g., competitive examinations), employees who will 
pass a one-year preparatory training and practice course and 
then be subjected to a diplomatic-consular examination at the 
ministry. In attaining successive levels (grades) of service 
(six) and occupying a position appropriate to the grade, the 
employee will know what awaits him tomorrow and in a few years, 
and not only will he know where he may be sent abroad, but he 
will also know what kind of career he can make for himself in 
the home office, what kind of positions are waiting for him when 
he returns, with what kind of salary and with what scope of 
duties. Furthermore, the position he occupies in Poland will 
have an influence on the position assigned abroad, and the 
reverse. 
  Rules of rotation (i.e., the filling of foreign posts) will 
be clear, taking into account the employee's expectations and 
the needs of the ministry. It is said in the MSZ that each year 
open positions in the consulates and embassies will be 
announced. Every candidate who meets the criteria will be able 
to compete for the openings, and the decisions will be made by a 
special commission. Furthermore, this will not be a closed 
system. The MSZ always made use of people from the outside, 
whether they were specialists (on Iran, for example) or to fill 
specific posts--e.g., cultural or press counselors. If such a 
need arises, the decision will be made by a qualification 
commission and the person employed on the basis of a contract 
for a specific period of time to perform a clearly defined task. 
In this way, in addition to the foreign service corps concept, 
another will appear: numbers of foreign service workers. 
  Thus, the diplomatic cadre will be professional and--permit 
me a little idealism here--apolitical. But, along with this, 
will be a definition of political positions that are subject to 
replacement when the government changes. In first place, of 
course, is the minister, followed by the deputy ministers, who 
form something on the order of a ministerial political council 
because the current work of the diplomatic service will be 
conducted by a professional--secretary of state, secretary 
general of the ministry, or something on that order. Certain 
ambassadorial positions would also be political. The practice of 
Western countries varies in this respect: from a 100-percent 
professional ambassador corps in Great Britain to a mixed system 
in the United States. In Poland, this will be determined by 
practice. People from the MSZ and deputies with whom I have 
spoken talk about a two-thirds to one-third ratio. But, although 
in the MSZ they would like to put the professionals in the first 
figure, the deputies would like to see the reverse, which, of 
course, is understandable. 
  At present, Poland employs a total of 3,213 people in its 
MSZ, 1,831 of whom are in tenured positions. The home office has 
917 employees and the outposts 2,226, of whom 904 are tenured. 
There are a total of 904 "merit" employees, 383 of whom are in 
the home office and 521 in the outposts. 
  This entire construction would include clearly defined 
criteria for selection (higher education, Polish citizenship, 
ability to perform legal duties, high moral qualities) and the 
scope of duties and responsibilities. There would be a suitable 
training system to improve the qualifications of the cadre, the 
basis of which would be a national public administration school 
and a new State Institute for International Relations (PISM). 
The old PISM, as we know, has been made part of the ministry 
structure. The new one would be a center for professional 
reports and reflections on international relations, as well as a 
place of postgraduate education and training. Consideration is 
also being given in the MSZ to a return to the proposal for an 
International School of Diplomacy, which was abandoned in 1992. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  This, of course, is not a full concept. The necessary 
documents, including the draft law, are still deeply hidden in 
the desk drawers of the chiefs of the ministry. But what we 
already know appears to be extremely attractive. We would be 
closer to a situation never previously encountered in the MSZ, 
one in which an employee would owe his position not to 
behind-the-scenes intrigues and shenanigans, but to his own 
knowledge and experience. Furthermore, clear rules of promotion 
and an open decisionmaking process should help to overcome the 
atmosphere of suspicion and jealousy now present in this 
ministry. In this sense, these rules can be used as a kind of 
model for other ministries. 
  I realize that the method of thinking presented in this 
concept is somewhat idealistic and that it will be extremely 
difficult to push it through parliament. But I think it is 
finally time to rise above parochial, party, and other interests 
so as to once and for all introduce some hardfast rules of 
operation. These words apply equally to the deputies on the 
subcommittee of the Sejm Commission of Foreign Affairs for cadre 
review in the MSZ. If they really want to improve the ministry's 
cadre policy, they will end, I hope, their disputes about the 
past and become the chief advocates of the new concept.

    [Editorial Report] An article in the 29 March issue of the 
Warsaw daily ZYCIE WARSZAWY takes issue with U.S. criticism of 
Polish arms sales to Burma because of that country's 
human-rights practices. Journalist Marek Meissner writes that 
Polish Government officials privately complain that Poland is 
being singled out because it is more susceptible to U.S. 
pressure than other arms-exporting countries and that a cutoff 
of Polish military exports to Burma would only benefit the 
Polish defense industry's foreign competitors. Meissner notes 
that German, Portuguese, Korean, Chinese, and Indonesian 
companies are currently exporting military hardware to Burma. He 
alleges that even U.S. firms have sold "obsolescent" equipment 
to Burma. 
  Meissner compares the current situation to an incident in 
1991, when, as a result of U.S. pressure, Poland withdrew from 
negotiations with Burma for a contract to supply several dozen 
armed Mi-2 helicopters. The order subsequently went to China. 
Meissner adds that, since then, U.S.-made Bell Model 212 
helicopters have been sold to Burma. 
  Meissner also notes that the Polish Defense Ministry denies 
that any large-scale transfer of weapons to Burma is taking 
place. He quotes ministry spokesman Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki as 
saying that "none of the large companies such as Cenzin [a 
state-owned arms-trading company] deliver materiel to Burma." 
According to Rozbicki, what is at issue is "merely a small 
amount of military equipment sold by a small firm."

<F P=106> [Report by Mladen Bosnjak on a news conference by Douglas </F>
Hogg, Minister of State at the British Foreign Office, in 
Sarajevo on 3 May -- recorded; Hogg speaks in English with 
superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] 
  [Text] [Bosnjak] My visit has focused on the 
implementation of the Washington Agreement and the work of the 
contact group, Douglas Hogg said. I am encouraged by the 
pragmatic views expressed by Mr. Silajdzic. From what I heard 
in Zagreb yesterday and in Sarajevo today, I can see that there 
is commitment to the implementation of the agreement. My 
impression is that the most important thing is to have a clear 
geographic delineation between the cantons. 
  There is no doubt that the Serb side is to be blamed for the 
current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina but, despite that, it 
cannot be excluded from the negotiations. From my talks with 
Prime Minister Silajdzic I gathered that there are limits beyond 
which one cannot go, and the most important one concerns the 
external borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those must not be 
touched, but there is still room for a much looser agreement on 
the relations between the Serbs on the one hand and the 
Muslim-Croat federation on the other. 
  It is important to stress that the contact group consists of 
those countries that have so far played the most significant 
role, and will continue to play it in the future. It is also 
important that Russia is also included, Hogg said, and added: 
  [Hogg] The contact group is engaged in two main tasks. The 
first is to achieve a cease-fire for a limited period, and the 
second is to try to find an agreement between the Bosniaks, the 
Croats, and the Serbs. I think that the engagement of the 
contact group is a big step ahead.

Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, after talks 
with Douglas Hogg, minister of state at the British Foreign 
Office, in Sarajevo on 3 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Cumurovic] Dr. Ejup Ganic said that the discussion 
on the implementation of the Washington Agreement was the main 
topic on the agenda at the talks at the Presidency: 
  [Ganic] I informed our esteemed guest that we were working 
together with the representatives of the Croatian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on the implementation, and that it has been 
going well so far. I do not see any major problems here. In a 
month's time we will [word indistinct] complete the bulk of the 
work, I think. On the other hand, I said that this is an open 
concept -- that is how we see it -- and for the Serbs who are 
not [word indistinct] in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This federal 
arrangement offers equal opportunities for all. 
  I also said that we (did not expect) the UK Government to 
insist on a solution that would accept the results of ethnic 
cleansing as this would be a precedent, a kind of virus that 
would remain and would later give a chance to someone else in 
another country to cause such a tragedy. I said that their 
[word indistinct] influence on the Serbs is completely dormant, 
and that we expect them to take a stricter line with the Serbs. 
The Serbs seem to think that they have (support) from London. 
These were our talks. 
  At the same time we said that we were cooperating with the 
contact group. However, we cannot give away something that does 
not belong to us, something that belongs to the people. We 
politicians have only a limited mandate when it comes to private 
property. We particularly spoke about cities, as most of the 
cities that have been occupied [words indistinct] were inhabited 
by Bosniaks as the majority nation. This is [word indistinct] 
entire infrastructure, cinemas, post offices, sewage system, 
roads, streetlights, all that belongs to the people who live 
there. Everyone knows what is whose. We want a solution to be 
reached in that context. 
  [Cumurovic] I consider the implementation of the Washington 
Agreement an important step in halting the war here, Douglas 
Hogg, UK Foreign Office minister, said. [passage indistinct]

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic 
had a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
special envoy Charles Redman. Mr Redman informed Prime Minister 
Silajdzic on the arrival of a contact group in Sarajevo on 
Thursday, 5 May. The Bosnia-Herzegovina prime minister informed 
Redman that the negotiations have been brought into question 
because of the disrespect for the NATO and UN ultimatum on the 
withdrawal of the aggressor forces from around Gorazde. 
Silajdzic emphasized the aggressor forces did not withdraw to a 
distance of three km from Gorazde and did not withdraw their 
heavy artillery from the 20 km exclusion zone from the town 
center as demanded by the ultimatum.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, 3 May (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the republic of Srpska, said in Pale today that the 
Serbian side has offered a truce in the Brcko area and added 
that the cease-fire would be implemented unilaterally, even if 
the Muslims refuse to accept it. [passage omitted] 
  "We also discussed the situation in Sarajevo and agreed on 
the need for the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] neutrality and 
restraint, and the warring sides' self-control. We included 
this in the discussion on a global cease-fire which the Serb 
side underlined as being in its interest -- something I also 
discussed with Haris Silajdzic," Akashi said. The UN secretary 
general's special envoy assessed today's talks as "a good basis 
for making progress in the peace process," adding that he 
thought "progress might be achieved in the near future." 
  In reply to a reporter's remark that the Muslim side is 
complaining about the presence of the Serbian militia in the 
Gorazde exclusion zone, Karadzic said that the United Nations 
will be controlling the militia and that UNPROFOR has already 
assumed responsibility for the job. This was confirmed by 
Yasushi Akashi. We agreed that the police will be performing 
its tasks under the supervision of UNPROFOR and our civilian 
police, Akashi explained. 
  Replying to questions about a recent armed clash between 
UNPROFOR and the republic of Srpska army near Tuzla, Akashi said 
that this incident was discussed in great detail. 
  "We presented our version of the event and heard the Serbian 
version, agreeing that similar situations should be avoided in 
the future and that things should be resolved at the local 
level," Akashi said. It was also agreed at the Pale meeting 
that members of UNPROFOR's British battalion -- who have been 
stranded in Rogatica for several days now -- should be allowed 
through to Gorazde under conditions acceptable to both sides.

  [Text] Zagreb, May 3 (AFP) -- UN envoy Yasushi Akashi 
called on Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic Tuesday [3 May] 
to allow UN observers into "critical areas," including the 
expected key flashpoint of Brcko, a UN spokesman said here. 
Akashi wants the monitors deployed to stabilize the conflict 
ahead of ceasefire talks, said Michael Williams, Akashi's 
spokesman, ahead of the UN envoy's meeting with Karadzic. 
  "Mr. Akashi will be pressing the point that it would be 
advisable to obtain an enhanced UNPROFOR observation in critical 
areas in order to stabilize the situation in anticipation of 
possible ceasefire negotiations," Williams said. 
  Brcko, in northeastern Bosnia, is thought to be the Serbs' 
next target after their standoff over Gorazde. Seizure of Brcko 
would widen a strategic corridor linking Serbia and Serb-held 
areas in northwestern Bosnia. 
  Akashi and UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander General 
Bertrand de Lapresle began talks with Karadzic during the 
afternoon in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale, the TANJUG 
news agency reported late Tuesday afternoon. "We are hoping 
that something positive in that regard will come out of the 
meeting this afternoon," Williams added. Earlier in the day 
Akashi met Bosnian Government leaders in Sarajevo. 
  Several western sources have reported concentrations of Serb 
and Bosnian Moslem forces near Brcko. Military experts have 
predicted it would their next strategic target after Gorazde.

  [Text] The fact that the chetnik security services are 
aiming to discredit the international humanitarian organizations 
that deliver aid to the citizens of Sarajevo is confirmed by the 
latest case where they planted ammunition in a convoy of the 
French humanitarian organization Premiere Urgence. This is 
stated in a communique from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Press 
Center. 
  After stopping the French humanitarian convoy, the chetniks 
took the drivers and the convoy escorts to Hotel Srbija, and 
parked the trucks in front of it. The operation to plant the 
ammunition in the trucks was organized by Miso Mijatovic, chief 
of the chetnik security services in Ilidza. He supervised the 
following members of the aggressor's military police: Sasa 
Rodnik, Captain Branislav, Dragan Draskovic, Boban Djurkovic, 
Gavro Grubacic, and Zoran Subotic, who brought the ammunition 
from a military warehouse in Luzani, and planted it the same 
evening among the humanitarian packages. 
  In the morning the trucks were inspected in front of the 
organizer and the members of the humanitarian convoy, while the 
SRNA TV team was already on the scene, who filmed and later 
broadcast the alleged discovery of the crates with the 
ammunition. 
  This is contained in the statement by the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army Press Center.

  [Text] Paris, May 3 (AFP) -- Three out of 11 French aid 
workers held by the Bosnian Serbs near Sarajevo risk the death 
penalty or jail terms of up to 20 years, a spokesman for the 
relief agency Premiere Urgence (First Aid) said on Tuesday. The 
11 members of Premiere Urgence were imprisoned in a Serb 
barracks at Lukavica, a suburb of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, 
on April 8 after their aid convoy was intercepted and on Monday, 
three of them were indicted for transporting arms to the Bosnian 
Moslems. 
  Spokesman Pascale de Lomas said judicial investigation of 
the 
case against the three would likely end on May 8 and their trial 
would follow immediately. The eight others would be freed. The 
parents of the only woman in the group, Patricia Ettouati, said 
the 11 were being held in the same room and were in good health, 
but had lost weight because of "foul food". 
  The Bosnian Serbs first proposed swapping the aid workers 
for 
11 Serb doctors and nurses held in Sarajevo by the Moslems. 
  Premiere Urgence, which has been active in Bosnia 
transporting food parcels to Sarajevo with the agreement of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, will send lawyers 
and observers from Amnesty International and the International 
Federation of Human Rights to the trial, to be staged in the 
Bosnian Serb capital of Pale. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has called the arrest of 
the 11 "hostage-taking" and demanded their "immediate and 
unconditional" release.

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, May 3 (AFP) -- [passage omitted] 
UNPROFOR spokesman French Major Eric Chaperon said a Serb T-34 
battle tank was intercepted overnight by French troops near the 
Lukavica barracks -- right in the heart of the NATO exclusion 
zone on heavy weapons around Sarajevo ordered in February. Both 
here and in the eastern town of Gorazde, heavy weapons were 
building up again in the exclusion zones "drop by drop," the 
spokesman said. Informed military sources also reported 
increased Bosnian Government army activity in the Mount Igman 
region overlooking Sarajevo, with units being relayed by fresh 
troops. The Serb tank was heading that way. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 3 (AFP) -- British troop 
reinforcements heading for the besieged Moslem town of Gorazde 
in eastern Bosnia were held up for the fourth day running by 
Bosnian Serbs on Tuesday, UN officials said. Major Eric 
Chaperon, spokesman for the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], said 
the 168 soldiers and 51 vehicles were blocked at Rogatica, 35 
kilometres (20 miles) from Sarajevo, and were unable to move 
forward or to retrace their steps. He said only that the 
British troops were being blocked "for administrative reasons." 
French and Ukrainian troops in the same convoy, which left 
Sarajevo on Saturday, were allowed to carry on and reached 
Gorazde on Monday. Chaperon dismissed suggestions that the 
British were "hostages." "We have not used the term `hostage' 
in similar past incidents and we have no reason to use it now," 
he said.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 4 May within its 
regular 8-minute newscast carries several reports on the 
situation in the republic. 
  Hamiz Deronjic reports that "artillery attacks on the 
defense 
lines of the free Brcko territory are becoming more and more 
frequent and intensive. Thus, during last night, the Serbian 
aggressor fired 82-mm mortars on the positions of the 108th 
Motorized Brigade and the 108th Infantry Brigade, as well as 
[word indistinct] units of the 2d Corps in Krajinovici, 
Vitanovici, [name indistinct], the central section of the 
battlefield, and the region of Modrica. The region of Vranovaca 
was exposed to the most intensive fire from 82-mm and 120-mm 
mortars. The aggressor has been incessantly regrouping his 
forces on the Brcko battlefield. (?Major) movements of the 
enemy's armored-mechanized equipment were observed on the 
central sector of the Brcko battlefield last night." 
  A report by the Press Center of the 3d Corps read by an 
unidentified correspondent says that "chetnik provocations on 
the Teslic battlefield" have become too much and that 
"yesterday, our forces carried out a strong counterattack 
whereby they took (Veliki Karanovici) and pressed the enemy 
deeply toward (Blato). Fierce fighting was waged on the 
Zavidovici region around Mahovski Vrh and, as the final outcome, 
the enemy was pushed back. Chetniks are continuing to shell the 
zone covered by the 7th South Operations Group. A 90-mm 
self-propelled gun [samohodka) at (Lovzije) shelled the village 
of Miljkovac, [name indistinct] and Alibegovici. With 82-mm and 
120-mm mortars, they showered the village of Lepenica where a 
child was wounded. The fact that the chetniks are going to 
continue such activities is shown by a column of five tanks that 
is heading toward (?Putnikovo Brdo)." 
  Viktor Boban reports from the Bosna Operations Group Press 
Center on "strong artillery fire by the aggressor on the 
Mahovski Vrh defense lines yesterday. The chetniks followed the 
artillery attack with a strong infantry assault trying to break 
through this defense line of the free Zavidovici territory. 
After heavy fighting, in the afternoon, the chetniks were 
pushed back to their original positions." Further on, Boban 
says that "following their defeat, the Chetniks have been fire 
fiercely on all defense lines as well as on populated places. 
Villages were occasionally shelled with 82-mm and 120-mm 
mortars until late into the night. Infantry arms attacks were 
launched on the stable defense lines of the 201st Chivalrous 
Brigade in Maglaj. Karadzic's paramilitary formations are still 
regrouping themselves, as well as bringing in new forces and 
military hardware, so new attacks on the zone covered by the 
Bosna Operations Group are to be expected." 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports on the situation in the Bihac region 
saying that "[Fikret] Abdic's paramilitary was firing 
antiaircraft weapons and heavy machine-guns all last night" and 
that "the morning hours are passing as usual, with provocations 
on almost all sections of the zone covered by the 5th Corps of 
the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Main Headquarters of the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO] of the Bihac region."

  [Text] Sarajevo, 3 May (TANJUG) -- President of the 
republic of Srpska Radovan Karadzic said in Pale today that the 
Serbian side had offered a truce in the Brcko region and added 
the truce would be implemented unilaterally, even if the Muslims 
did not accept it. Karadzic held over three hours of talks in 
Pale with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special 
envoy, and after the talks expressed satisfaction with the 
outcome. 
  "This is a very good example of cooperation, for we achieved 
significant progress at the talks today. Primarily, we cleared 
some problematic aspects of the situation in Sarajevo, Gorazde, 
and Brcko," Karadzic told reporters. "We offered the Muslim 
side a truce in the Brcko area, and if they do not accept, it we 
shall implement it unilaterally. If the Muslims agree to the 
deployment of military observers on both sides in the Brcko 
region, it will be a good example of a preventative action aimed 
at ending the crisis," Karadzic said. 
  Yasushi Akashi said they agreed to continue work on the 
stabilization of the overall situation, in particular in 
Gorazde, in accordance with an agreement reached in Belgrade. 
  "We also discussed the events around Tuzla and Brcko, where 
some military movements have been registered," Akashi said.

<F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic] </F>
  [Text] The people of Gorazde remember 4 May as the 
beginning of the aggression on this town. Just as they did two 
years ago, chetniks attacked this morning as well. They were 
shelling defense lines at the northwest section of the 
battlefield. They opened mortar and intensive infantry fire at 
the Pobjeda Factory from Grbavo Brdo. The situation was the 
same along the entire line of separation at the left bank of the 
Drina. They were peaceful at the right bank this morning, but 
despite all decrees, resolutions, and ultimatums, they are still 
positioned only several hundred meters away from the town 
center. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] forces are trying to do 
something, but without effect. They are explaining this by the 
fact that they have no authorization and precise instructions 
from their superiors and that they are waiting for results of 
the Silajdzic-Akashi and Karadzic-Akashi talks. 
  The Chetniks, however, are not waiting at all. They continue 
plundering, carrying out provocations, blackmailing, and 
distorting facts. This could certainly not be done without 
influential sponsors in the United Nations.

  [Text] Probably thanks to Mr. Akashi's visit, the chetniks 
have reduced the number of cease-fire violations in Sarajevo 
today. Still, their snipers have managed to wound one civilian 
today near the Simon Bolivar primary school in Dobrinja. They 
also fired with an antiaircraft machine gun from Azici on the 
city's free territory. Throughout the day they have been 
carrying out tactical regrouping of men and equipment in various 
directions, and grouping of their army on certain positions 
around Sarajevo. There are indications that their sniper fire 
and other military activities could intensify, so the citizens 
are reminded to take seriously all the caution warnings. 
  This is reported by the [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army] 1st Corps 
Information Center.

  [Text] After an infernal day yesterday, in the evening the 
aggressor continued barbarously shelling civilian populated 
places in the free Zvornik territory until late last night. 
Kovacevici and Vitinica were shelled with T-55 tanks from 
Androvici, Sapna was shelled with 120-mm mortars from Kiseljak, 
and houses were destroyed in Godus with a 205-mm howitzer from 
the direction of Celopek. A multiple rocket launcher operated 
at the Medjedja region from the direction of Kiseljak launching 
projectiles of huge destructive power. Five civilians, 
including three children less than 10 years old, were wounded as 
a result of this special chetnik shelling. 
  Our defense positions were also exposed to constant fire 
from 
all kinds of weapons and artillery pieces. In the morning, the 
shelling with the most destructive long-range artillery pieces 
continued, but despite this, defense lines have remained firm 
and unchanged. 
  This was a report by the Information Service of the 206th 
Chivalrous Brigade of Zvornik for the Radio and Television of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

addition to intensified small-arms fire along the contact line, 
Moslem forces acted most fiercely from the direction of Bejici 
whence they fired 82-mm mortars sporadically on Serb positions 
west of Doboj.

using mortar and antitank missiles for attacks on the Mostar 
battlefield. According to the Muslim radio, this is yet another 
indication that the extreme part of the HVO has still not given 
up its expansionist ambitions and its ultimate goal of dividing 
Mostar.

  [Text] In the zone covered by the 4th Corps, yesterday 
passed as usual. Usual means that constant infantry and 
artillery fire was opened on civilian places and positions of 
the fighters of Bosnia-Herzegovina from the positions of the 
Serbo-Montenegrin aggressor. The situation was such on the 
Mostar battlefield, the region of Blagaj, where chetniks 
operated with an antiaircraft machine gun on Ravnica. On the 
opposite side of the zone, in the region of (Bjelimica), the 
chetniks used an antiaircraft gun, antiaircraft machine guns, 
and a tank to operate on the villages of Mokro and (Jargul) and 
in the morning, they acted with a ZIS gun and an antiaircraft 
gun on the village of Ocrkavlje. 
  Night was calm on the Konjic battlefield, as well as in 
Jablanica, the Neretvica Valley, and the region of (?Prozor). 
  This was a report by the Information Service of the 4th 
Corps.

  [Excerpt] Zvornik, 3 May (TANJUG) -- Transportation of aid 
through the territory of the republic of Srpska resumed today in 
accordance with the Serb side's decision fully to normalize 
humanitarian aid transportation, TANJUG has learned from the 
command of the republic of Srpska army's Zvornik garrison. Like 
yesterday, a UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] 
humanitarian aid convoy crossed the Drina River near Zvornik 
carrying prefabricated homes for the Muslim enclave of 
Srebrenica. A logistics convoy of 18 vehicles and 40 French 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] members has left for Sarajevo.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item; by Vjekoslav Radovic] </F>
  [Text] New York, May 3 (TANJUG) -- It appears that the U.N. 
Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) is allowed 
only to open fire, as it did recently at Kalesi and Gorazde, 
when 12 members of the Army of the Bosnian Serb Republic (VRS) 
were killed, according to news reports, but is not allowed to 
see what it sees and to hear what it hears, let alone to say 
publicly anything about it. 
  The above results from U.N. Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's reply to a letter received from United States 
U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, in which Butrus-Ghali was 
sharply censured for the statements made by his generals and 
civilian representatives in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which the 
truth was told about the conflict in that former Yugoslav 
republic and the U.S. foreign policy was criticized. 
  Albright a week ago vehemently criticized Butrus-Ghali's 
special envoy for the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi for 
refusing to order new air strikes against Serbs at Gorazde, a 
town in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  There followed statements of UNPROFOR commander for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael Rose and other unidentified 
U.N. officials who insisted that the reports from Gorazde were 
false, that the figures about the casualties and destruction 
were overinflated, and that the U.S. had nearly drawn the United 
Nations into a larger-scale war on the basis of incorrect 
assumptions. 
  In the latest letter to the U.N. secretary-general, Albright 
said she was writing to protest in the strongest possible terms 
the comments of U.N. officials who keep the secretary-general 
directly informed through Akashi. 
  Butrus-Ghali replied the same day to the closely-spaced 
two-page letter, saying he shared the U.S. ambassador's deep 
concern over the fact that the criticism of the U.S. policy in 
the former Yugoslavia by ranking UNPROFOR officials had been 
quoted in news reports. The U.N. secretary-general said he had 
sent a letter to Akashi informing him that he considered such 
comments totally unacceptable and requesting a thorough 
investigation. Butrus-Ghali said he had asked of Akashi to take 
all steps for such things not to happen again. 
  Without speculating about whether "the gentleman had backed 
down," as some claim, or just the opposite was true, the message 
is clear: UNPROFOR must keep silent and dance to the U.S. tune. 
  Butrus-Ghali's spokesman Joe Sills has told the press that 
both Akashi and General Rose continue to have the 
secretary-general's confidence. However, it is obvious that 
they do not have Washington's confidence and that whether they 
will keep their current posts will most likely depend on the 
degree of their obedience. 
  Sills practically quoted a part of Albright's letter when he 
said that the secretary-general felt it was not all right for 
ranking U.N. officials or peace operation personnel to criticise 
the policy of Western U.N. member-countries. Sills said U.N. 
officials in the field should use other means than the press to 
get the information to their superior on the east river. It is 
well known, however, that Butrus-Ghali has several times 
"misplaced" key reports about the guilt of the Muslim side in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that he has rejected to publish the 
report of a commission which has investigated crimes committed 
by U.N. troops, primarily U.S., in Somalia. 
  Under the constant threat from Washington that it will cut 
off funds, Butrus-Ghali has decided to close the eyes and shut 
the ears of the UNPROFOR personnel, and has thus reduced the 
United Nations to a blind follower of U.S. policy. The U.S. has 
put a "dollar muzzle" on UNPROFOR and released the safety on 
their rifles. Butrus-Ghali's acquiescence with such a state 
leads the United Nations to an abyss in which the League of 
Nations had found itself prior to World War Two.

  [Text] We just received a press communique from the 
Albanian Foreign Ministry which states: Today, 3 May 1994, the 
official meeting between the Albanian Foreign Ministry 
delegation led by Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi and the Greek 
Foreign Ministry delegation led by Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolios Papoulias was held in Zurich, Switzerland, a meeting 
decided upon long ago to analyze Albanian-Greek relations 
following the terrorist action against a recruit training center 
in Peshkepi on 10 April 1994. 
  During the meeting, the Albanian delegation stressed that 
the 
Albanian democratic government considers Albanian-Greek 
relations to be very important not only at the bilateral level, 
but also for the whole region. It has shown goodwill for the 
normal and useful development of these relations on the basis of 
the principle of reciprocity and noninterference in each other's 
internal affairs. 
  Nevertheless, the Albanian delegation pointed out that 
unfortunately, we determine that we have recently been 
confronted with a series of incidents and provocations, but 
there is no precedence for the 10 April act of terrorism. The 
furious reactivation and conspicuous and uninhibited 
aggressiveness of the Vorio-Epirus chauvinist circles, the 
irresponsible anti-Albanian statements issued by several 
high-level Greek state personalities, the exploitation of 
certain elements of the Greek minority in Albania to achieve 
expansionist ambitions, the provocative interference -- contrary 
to every diplomatic ethic -- of Greek diplomats in the internal 
affairs of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the 
Albanian state, the absence of a serious commitment by the Greek 
Government to throw light on the tragic event in Peshkepi and 
make criminals legally responsible underscore these incidents. 
  The Albanian side asked the Greek Government to immediately 
take measures to prevent the frenzied warmongering propaganda of 
radio stations installed in southern Greece, Corfu, and Konjice, 
and publications by the Institute of Vorio-Epirus Studies in 
Ioanniana, which call for making territorial claims so far as to 
include armed intervention against Albania, as well as the 
measures necessary so that the terroristic acts are not repeated 
in the future. Its public stance should be clearly dissociated 
from the absurd chauvinistic claims directed toward the south of 
Albania. 
  For his part, after assessing Albanian-Greek relations to be 
very important, the Greek foreign minister reiterated his 
willingness to cooperate for a rapid normalization of bilateral 
relations and assented that the Greek Government will fulfill 
the aforementioned demand. 
  Concerning the investigation of the event, the Albanian side 
insisted that the Greek side agree to an investigation from an 
international unbiased commission, assessing that both sides 
should be interested in an objective and impartial assessment of 
evidence. 
  For his part, Mr. Papoulias objected to the Albanian side's 
opinion and, referring to the Ioannina meeting between the 
Public Order Ministries of both countries, proposed the 
activation of a joint commission between the relevant Public 
Order Ministries. 
  The Albanian side explained that the freeze on the execution 
of the decision to reduce Greek Embassy staff does not mean its 
non- execution and stressed that, within a reasonable deadline 
and in conformity with the Vienna Convention provisions, the 
staff of the representations of both countries will be reduced 
to the extent necessary for their normal functioning at the 
present level of relations. 
  During the meeting, they also discussed other aspects of 
Albanian-Greek relations, such as Albanian economic emigration 
in Greece, border administration between both countries, the 
presence of Albanians since earlier times, and the Cam issue in 
all its aspects. 
  The Greek foreign minister laid stress on the reactivation 
of 
the joint Albanian-Greek commission and the need to open a 
branch of the Greek National Bank in Tirana, and also referred 
to the draft agreement on seasonal employment that the Greek 
side has furnished to the Albanian side. 
  The Albanian delegation stressed that the Albanian side is 
studying the aforementioned issues and pointed put that the 
draft agreement on seasonal employment does not solve the 
question of legalizing the Albanian present economic emigration 
in Greece. 
  For its part, the Greek side confirmed that this draft 
agreement will provide the legal framework for the future, but 
it will also be a basis for future emigration. 
  In conclusion, both sides expressed the sentiment that the 
climate of Albanian-Greek relations has been aggravated, and all 
efforts should be made to create an atmosphere of bilateral 
confidence. 
  The Albanian side stressed that it does not acknowledge 
responsibility for the situation created in these relations and 
that, as always, it will be ready and willing to render, through 
dialogue, constructive assistance to normalize relations between 
Albania and Greece, which are in the interest of relations 
between both countries and the entire Balkan region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F>
Horn by Jozef Uram in Budapest; date not given: "For Horn, 
There Is No Alternative to the Pro-Western Orientation"] 
  [Text] Budapest -- The opinion polls in Hungary have been 
indicating for several weeks that the government of this country 
will most probably change. The Hungarian Socialist Party 
(MSZP), for which -- according to the latest polls -- almost 40 
percent of citizens want to cast their votes next Sunday [8 
May], has the greatest chance. The chairman of this political 
formation, former Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, deserves much of 
the credit for this trend. Mr. Horn, who will most likely be 
the next Hungarian prime minister, granted MLADA FRONTA DNES an 
exclusive interview. 
  [Uram] What result is your party expecting in the elections? 
In the event that the MSZP wins, will you become prime minister? 
  [Horn] I do not want to hazard a guess, but I would be very 
satisfied if we were to win almost 40 percent of the votes, as 
the recent polls indicate. We have no candidate for the office 
of prime minister; it is not important whether it is I or anyone 
else from our party who attains this responsible post. 
  [Uram] It is being said that, after your victory, you want 
to form a government of experts. In your opinion, what does 
this mean? 
  [Horn] There is a great difference between a caretaker 
government or -- as we say in our country -- a government of 
experts and a government composed of experts. In our case, the 
situation is such that the country's economic and social changes 
and the pressures from abroad -- I mean here, first and 
foremost, the major recession in the West that somehow does not 
want to pass and whose repercussions are also affecting Hungary 
-- are placing huge demands on managing the transformation 
process. In this situation, it is essential that people who are 
the best in their field obtain posts in the government. 
  [Uram] There is a great deal of speculation about whether 
the MSZP will cooperate with the liberal bloc, specifically the 
Union of Free Democrats. In your opinion, is such a coalition 
possible after the election? 
  [Horn] It is possible; the choice of coalition partners is 
not so broad. However, we would not want to form a coalition 
that would be incapable of cooperation or that would just hamper 
it. Moreover, the vast majority of people want a change of 
government. The voters would be cheated if the parties from the 
present coalition were to return to the government. Therefore, 
it is mainly the current opposition parties that are being taken 
into consideration. We are open to them, but in order to do 
business, two are necessary. 
  [Uram] What is the socialists' attitude toward the Hungarian 
minorities abroad? What is the difference between the policy of 
the current government and your party in the issue of minorities 
abroad? 
  [Horn] We want a historic settlement with Hungary's 
neighbors. This settlement means that we must not deal with 
historic wrongs. In other words: This is not a matter for 
topical policy, but is a matter for the historians and 
scientists. It is also important that we meet each other half 
way and do so by taking steps that will boost mutual trust. It 
is wrong if two sides frequently misinterpret various statements 
that are subsequently portrayed as the official point of view of 
one of them. It is necessary to proceed from what government 
representatives, official circles, parliament, and political 
parties say and not from what certain extremist groups say. We 
would be happy to conclude basic treaties with both Slovakia and 
Romania, as we have already done with Ukraine. 
  [Uram] Including the borders issue? 
  [Horn] Yes; these treaties should express unequivocally our 
point of view on the issue of the unchangeability of the present 
borders. On the other hand, it is essential to guarantee 
thoroughly -- and I would like to emphasize the word thoroughly 
-- the minorities' universal rights. This is not just a 
Hungarian demand or the demand of local Hungarians. It ensues 
from the international commitments that neighboring countries 
have also adopted. I think that, in any case, it would be 
essential to actuate economic, political, and other contacts 
with our neighbors, because these are not developing the way 
they should. Western markets are opening up to us very 
restrictively; the conditions are extraordinarily tough. We are 
convinced, however, that there is no alternative to the pro- 
Western orientation. We all want -- whether it is ourselves, 
Slovakia, or the Czech Republic -- to catch up with the West and 
we want to join the European Union. At the same time, however, 
we must not neglect relations with each other. In this way, we 
can also do more in the interest of Hungarians abroad. 
Definitely more than by making irresponsible statements. 
  [Uram] It is sometimes said of Vaclav Klaus -- who came to 
power as an unequivocally right-wing politician -- that he is 
implementing a socially more effective policy than many 
politicians who defend social interests. Do you put this down 
just to the economic strength of the Czech Republic? Could this 
policy be an example for other countries? 
  [Horn] I cannot assess precisely the economic situation in 
the Czech Republic; this much I do know, however, that the 
really major changes, which have a drastic impact, have not yet 
been carried out in the Czech lands. The fundamental changes -- 
without wanting to make comparisons -- began in Hungary much 
sooner. Privatization, developing the banking sector, and many 
other areas of transformation have already made their onerous 
consequences felt. This is one thing. There is, however, 
something else and there is a certain misunderstanding here. It 
is said that the left is opposed to a sound economic performance 
out of consideration for the social aspects. This is not true. 
The left is not opposed to sound performance. Look at Austria 
where a social democratic government has been in power for more 
than 20 years. It is indeed impossible to accuse Austria of a 
poor economic performance. It is, however, possible to agree 
with the right on taking more social issues into consideration. 
I would not divide this issue into black and white. In 
practice, it is necessary to indicate who represents what under 
these concepts. The conservative right wing in Eastern Europe 
has not achieved major successes; on the contrary. I think it 
is no coincidence that these governments are being replaced more 
and more in our region. 
  [Uram] Let us return again to Hungarian domestic policy. 
Are you concerned about the threat from the extreme right wing? 
Is there a real danger that the extremists will gain strength 
in the elections or even win them? 
  [Horn] Such a danger exists. To be more precise: There are 
militant extremist groups in our country. They manage to 
influence many people by intimidation and whipping up hatred. 
They lead people astray, for example, in relation to our 
neighbors. This extreme right wing is as a rule strongly 
nationalistic and we all know where nationalism leads. This 
danger exists and we must not underestimate it. Hungarian 
experiences indicate, however, that the extreme right wing is 
limited to a very narrow group of people. We have a mature 
society that will not gravitate toward extremes. People want 
balanced conditions and a moderate policy. They want 
reconciliation, both within the country and with our neighbors.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Socialist Party, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not given: 
"List Leaders Give Interviews -- Horn: A Full Next Cycle Can Be 
Served With a Changed Style"] 
  [Text] In our election series, list leaders of parties 
that set up a national list give interviews on their party's 
typical program points and concepts. This time, we interviewed 
Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], 
who said that this campaign is again filled with categorizing 
one another. 
  [Szombathy] What kind of program have the Socialists managed 
to prepare and what are the main elements of action? So far, 
apart from categorizing one another, we have not heard much 
about the program points. 
  [Horn] It is unfortunate that, rather than discussing the 
important issues, this campaign is again filled with 
categorizing one another. Hardly any parties talk about the 
real problems: unemployment, the possibilities of changing the 
economic structure, restoring agriculture, and public law and 
order. Without handling and solving these kinds of issues the 
country will be unable to get out of the crisis. The MSZP's 
professional and political program was preceded by many months 
of expert discussions, and we also tested our ideas on the 
broader public. Naturally, the implementation of these depends 
on the circumstances after the elections, not only on our 
intentions. It is unfortunate that the government does not give 
much attention to the kind of situation in which it will pass 
the power over. In 1993, the economic condition of the country 
went through a lot of deterioration: The deficit of the payment 
balance increased to an unprecedented level and reached $3.5 
billion. The country's foreign debt service obligations 
rocketed because the government had taken on more than $6 
billion loans through the least favorable bond form. We are all 
facing very heavy burdens: According to some views, without 
some urgent measures of the new government, the country might 
become impossible to finance in the near future. We should be 
dealing with these cutting issues in the campaign. 
  [Szombathy] What kind of debates preceded the finalization 
of the Socialist program? 
  [Horn] I think that this issue belongs to the past now 
because these debates have been concluded. The MSZP managed to 
come to a compromise. It is obvious that, with the approach of 
the elections, all parties are trying to formulate promises that 
are impossible or hardly possible to fulfill. I add that the 
opposition parties are in a more difficult situation because 
many facts are not known to them. Therefore, they have to keep 
comparing their statements with reality. I can say with 
confidence that the Laszlo Bekesi's economic policy program 
reflects the MSZP's perception and its intentions to act. The 
internal debates were also useful because this program had gone 
through significant changes compared to the original version. 
  [Szombathy] If you come to government, what will be the 
first tasks of the cabinet? 
  [Horn] We immediately have to start to form a realistic view 
of the situation, we have to hold talks with the World Bank, and 
we have to make a permanent agreement with the IMF. Only a 
coalition agreement open to public scrutiny can be lasting. 
Whatever kind of government is formed, it will have a serious 
chance to complete its term only if it changes the current style 
and attempts to treat society as an adult partner. It has to 
show a large amount of self-moderation and begin the savings 
with itself. It will definitely have to start to streamline the 
state apparatus. 
  [Szombathy] How can the aggravated media situation be 
solved? 
  [Horn] Everything possible has to be done to establish 
impartiality in the public service media. The Hungarian 
Television's future might lie in keeping only Channel 1 for 
public service and it would be a good idea to privatize the 
other. Drawing up a media law instead of the terminated version 
will be one of the most urgent tasks of the new Parliament. It 
would not be good, either, if a witch hunt were started in the 
media: People who are good at their jobs should be kept, but 
perhaps not in their current positions. 
  [Szombathy] Do you consider the possibility of the MSZP 
remaining in opposition after the elections? If you are too 
strong then it might be difficult to find a coalition partner 
because, with your dominance in government, you might "gobble 
up" others. 
  [Horn] Relations within a coalition are not decided by the 
number of mandates. Several western examples prove that, in 
case of overwhelming victory, the will of the other partners is 
also considered. It is difficult to imagine a coalition 
agreement if the partners do not agree on the choice of people. 
I am not worried about these fears. 
  [Szombathy] How would you comment on the public service 
television's boldest attack on you: The "Panorama" program 
showed a witness whom you had supposedly injured. 
  [Horn] It is unprecedented for a public service media to 
shower a political party with so many abuses. The latest 
edition of "Panorama" is a culmination of this. If the editors 
had asked me, I would have told them that I had never been to a 
prisoners' hospital or in Kelebia. The statements were gross 
lies that hurt my human dignity without giving me a chance to 
answer all this. The government is responsible for the 
degeneration of the attacks: All this is making a subsequent 
dialogue between the political forces impossible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor Krejci </F>
in Prague; date not given: "Membership in More Than One 
Political Party Is, in My Opinion, a Typical Case of Bigamy"] 
  [Text] [Krejci] The government proposes that membership 
in political parties be exclusive. This means that no one can 
be a member of several political parties at the same time. The 
opposition claims that such a law would violate the Constitution 
and the Charter on Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. What is 
your view of this issue? 
  [Klaus] I am not an exponent of the Constitution or of the 
Charter on Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. However, I have the 
feeling that many people in our country shield themselves by 
their reading and interpretation of these documents. They then 
reach certain conclusions from which it would appear that, on 
the one hand, everything is possible and that, on the other, 
nothing at all is possible. 
  In my opinion, membership in two or more political parties 
is 
like a marriage with more than one spouse. This is simply a 
typical case of bigamy, and I do not believe it would make sense 
to introduce something like this into our legal code. 
  [Krejci] You have visited Argentina, Chile, and Brazil. 
What impression has this visit made on you? Could you compare 
the reform process in our country and Chile? 
  [Klaus] The strongest impression I have from this visit is 
one of enormous contrasts--both between the individual countries 
and within each state unit. We do not like it when someone 
views the postcommunist part of Europe as a monolithic mass. 
However, I must say to everyone who does not like this that we 
also have a priori a slightly simplified view of this part of 
the world. 
  The sociopolitical sphere also made a strong impression on 
me. These countries are very dissimilar, and the political 
situation in each is different. Argentina has a distinct and 
strong government led by Menem and Cabal that is undoubtedly 
pushing this country forward. Chile is in the post-Pinochet 
phase, and something like our Civic Forum governs there. No 
obvious positive consensus has been reached yet on the way 
forward. Brazil, in the political sense, is in a very unstable 
situation, and you will not find personalities of the 
Argentinian or Chilean caliber there. 
  As far as Chile is concerned, it is going through its own 
form of coming to terms with the past, which, for it, is still 
terribly close and within reach. While in our country the 
victims of communist despotism, which was far worse at the 
beginning, are in the 60-to-80-year-old age group, in Chile this 
happened 15 years ago. This means that the people affected are 
still young. Therefore, in this country the issue of coming to 
terms with the past is completely different from what it is in 
our country. My idea, often repeated in our country, of a 
rear-view mirror attracted a great deal of attention in Chile. 
This greatly inspired President Frey and, apparently, he will 
incorporate it into his speeches. General Pinochet is still 
commander of the Army and, therefore, is an important official. 
Nevertheless, in Chile they have decided to very quickly draw a 
thick line under the past and go on. Indeed, they have no major 
restitution-rehabilitation and screening problems there. The 
president of the Senate, who is a very affable fellow, said in 
this context that he was imprisoned twice under Pinochet, but 
this does not prevent him from going to dinner with him today. 
This is indeed a slightly different view from the one we have, 
and it is worth making the comparison. 
  [Krejci] The post of education minister has become vacant. 
What is your stance on filling this position? 
  [Klaus] Within the framework of the coalition, the Civic 
Democratic Party respects the fact that the Christian Democratic 
Party holds this post. As far as the candidate is concerned, I 
have to say that, so far, no talks have been held.

  [Text] A meeting of the Solidarity Hard-Coal Council has 
been held in Katowice. Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski 
took part in the meeting, which ended in the early hours of the 
morning. 
  [Correspondent Witold Orzech] The trade unionists have sent 
a 
letter to Trade and Industry Minister Marek Pol, registering 
their vote of no-confidence in the boards of all coal companies. 
They think that the boards are not coping with the current 
situation. The Miners Solidarity has also called on the minister 
to take measures aimed at removing the causes of conflicts and 
tensions in the mining industry. 
  The hard-coal miners' assessment of the agreement between 
their colleagues in the lignite-mining industry and the 
government was sceptical. They adopted a resolution that the 
strike at 16 hard-coal mines in Katowice province and three zinc 
and lead mines should continue. 
  Karol Luzniak, the hard-coal section chairman, announced 
that 
miners from several other mines will join the strike starting at 
0600. 
  Marian Krzaklewski expressed the hope that the national 
industrial action starting today will prove successful for both 
Solidarity and the government, that the strike will make the 
government understand that it should not aim at confrontation 
with the union. As a result, when the government finally comes 
to understand this, [Finance Minister] Mr. Kolodko will have not 
60 but 120 or more days of peace, Marian Krzaklewski said. He 
did not rule out the possibility of using the strike fund for 
payouts to strike participants.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic 
today received Douglas Hogg, minister of state at the British 
Foreign Office. On this occasion Silajdzic said that a limited 
cease-fire could be significant for the resumption of 
negotiations. He stressed that the aggressor was buying time 
with his acts -- such as bringing in soldiers dressed in police 
uniforms in and around Gorazde, and settling its people in other 
people's houses. 
  We have established a federation of Bosniaks and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats, and we are still offering the 
federation to those who want to live with us, Silajdzic said. 
  Asked by Hogg what kind of relations would be established 
with the Serbian entity in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Silajdzic said: 
Whatever kind of entity they choose, they can join the 
federation. However, we cannot allow the people of Banja Luka 
to not be able to return to their homes. The international 
community has to guarantee them this right. All this would 
imply that the Serbs will have relations with Serbia, but not to 
the disadvantage of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We believe that the contact group has a lot to do. We are 
taking it seriously, and we think that it is important for all 
of us, Silajdzic added.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the Democratic Party of Albania" -- ATA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, May 3 (ATA) -- Recently Albanian Orthodoxs, 
wherever they live in Albania, celebrated freely and in a 
festive way the great Easter and the resurrection day of Jesus 
Christ, a press release of the Democratic Party [DP] points out. 
The Albanian democratic state and all the Albanians respected 
the religious feelings of the Albanian Orthodox believers. The 
Albanian Television devoted an expanded part of its programs to 
the religious ceremonies of the Orthodox Easter. 
  But, we regret that the Greek manipulations and provocations 
were not absent even during this marked religious holiday. The 
Democratic Party of Albania denounces as groundless and 
niggardly the interventions of the Greek Government in affairs 
of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. These acts speak 
of another example of the continual Greek interventions in the 
internal affairs of Albania. The Albanian Autocephalous 
Orthodox Church is independent in its activity and mission and 
being so it has served and serves the Albanian Orthodox 
believers and national interests of Albania. We avail of the 
opportunity, the DP press release emphasizes, to remind his 
holiness, Janullatos, that tens and hundreds of Albanian 
clergies and patriots have been tried and sacrificed their lives 
for the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. The Democratic 
Party of Albania considers as holy the independence of the 
Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and condemns any 
intervention and intrusion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F>
Ramon Lobo in Sarajevo; date not given: "Silajdzic: `UN Hates 
Bosnia'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Silajdzic suggests in this 
interview with EL PAIS, given in the prime minister's residence 
in Sarajevo, that as things stand it would be better for the 
United Nations to withdraw from Bosnia. 
  [Lobo] What have you learned from the last three or four 
weeks, from the events of Gorazde and the actions of the 
international community in this crisis? 
  [Silajdzic] The United Nations has developed a very negative 
role. It has not used the mandate it was given and did not 
accept NATO's offer to bomb Serbian positions when their 
artillery continued to kill civilians after the ultimatum was 
issued. It appears that someone very high up (politically -- EL 
PAIS editor's note) has tried to save these fascists from being 
punished. In Gorazde alone, and nobody knows why, they killed 
719 people. Their aim was to force the inhabitants out and to 
conquer the territory. This has been going on for the last two 
years. There are still people who call this a civil war which, 
translated into political language means "I do not want to get 
involved." Everyone knows that this is not a civil war but 
aggression, and that the tanks, artillery, and soldiers come 
from Serbia. Everyone knows that, and yet nobody wants to call 
it genocide. Do you know why? Because if they did, they would 
have to intervene. Everything is just an excuse, and when NATO 
and the United States take the initiative and the alliance is 
ready to put a stop to this hell, the United Nations then says 
no. 
  [Lobo] When you say that someone very high up is playing 
dirty, to which country or to whom are you alluding? 
  [Silajdzic] If I had wanted to say who, I would have said so 
before now. Clearly, there are people very high up who have 
allowed this to continue for two years and at the same time they 
have kept our hands tied (by the embargo -- EL PAIS editor's 
note). They have prevented us from defending ourselves and they 
have let the Serbs do anything. This is not a war, it is 
genocide. Now, the United Nations comes here and tells us: 
Look, there are two parties involved and we do not want to take 
sides. What is happening here is not just a violation of the 
basic UN Charter, it is a violation of every principle. If the 
United Nations will not respect its own charter and its own 
resolutions, why doesn't it just get out? 
  [Lobo] Are you asking the United Nations to leave Bosnian 
soil? 
  [Silajdzic] I believe that, since Gorazde, there should be a 
major change in the UN leadership. Srebrenica was a year ago. 
Now the same thing has just happened to Gorazde. They allowed 
this (the Serbian offensive -- EL PAIS editor's note) to last 
almost four weeks, and despite this being a safe area. Why 
didn't the United Nations defend this protected area? Who is 
supposed to protect it? And all the while, these people are 
sitting in the UN building in New York raking in huge salaries! 
  [Lobo] Some people think that the Bosnian Government has 
been 
dreaming too much of the possibility of foreign military 
intervention and that, after the events of Gorazde, you have 
realized that this intervention will never come. 
  [Silajdzic] I'm sorry? So all this has been a way of getting 
this message across to us? Perhaps. If this were the case, we 
would be faced with mass murder planned by the international 
community itself. However, I do not think this is the case. I 
think that the United Nations and some people high up in the 
organization hate Bosnia. This has been most apparent over the 
last two years. They have been against any action. 
  [Lobo] What do you think of UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali and his special envoy Yasushi Akashi? 
  [Silajdzic] I think they have held up NATO action. I can 
name 20 towns that have been destroyed before Butrus-Ghali's 
very eyes. When the alliance wanted to act against this 
murderous machine (the Serbian Army -- EL PAIS editor's note), 
they stopped them. Why? I don't know, but it is a violation of 
the resolutions passed by the UN Security Council. These now 
are nothing more than pieces of paper. Who is responsible for 
implementing these resolutions? The answer is very simple: the 
secretary general. What is he doing?! 
  [Lobo] What do you think of the role played by the United 
States in this crisis? 
  [Silajdzic] At the end of the day, it has been the United 
States that has done everything. Right from the air drops of 
humanitarian aid... We would have preferred everything to have 
been done much more quickly. For some things, it is now too 
late, yes, but in the final analysis it was the Americans who 
forced the others into the Gorazde ultimatum. Maybe it is very 
little coming very slowly. 
  [Lobo] What about the European Union's stance? 
  [Silajdzic] It has been more positive in recent months. 
Before, the Community was a witness to a tragedy. For a long 
time, it is true, they sent us supplies, but they have to answer 
the question of why they imposed the arms embargo on us and left 
so many people to die. That is a moral responsibility. 
  [Lobo] Are you ready to sign a cease-fire agreement? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, for three or four months, while 
negotiations 
are under way. However, they want to keep the situation as it 
stands and want the United Nations to award them the territory 
they have conquered. That will not happen, however. Bosnia 
Herzegovina will remain a single country. I have nothing 
against Serbia's size, as long as it remains within its own 
borders and does not grow at the expense of Bosnia. 
  [Lobo] One last question... What do you think of the role 
played by the Spanish soldiers in Mostar? 
  [Silajdzic] I did not like it. There were problems. There 
are many signs that they took the side of the Croatian 
extremists. We are not very pleased with them. I intend to 
talk with the Spanish Government on this subject.

  [Text] Sofia, May 4 (BTA) -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria states the following in 
connection with the signing of the agreement on limited 
Palestinian self-rule: 
  The agreement signed on May 4, 1994 by Israeli Prime 
Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is an important step 
towards achieving just, all-embracing and lasting peace in the 
Middle East. In a relatively brief period of time after the 
Middle East peace process was launched in Madrid in late 1991, 
two of the most important participants in the negotiations have 
shown that political will, mutual compromises and concessions 
can result in considerable progress in the further solution of 
the complicated problems which have accumulated in the region 
over the past decades. 
  Hailing the signing of this important document, the Republic 
of Bulgaria expresses its belief that it reveals real 
possibilities for continuing peace negotiations after the Madrid 
formula and creates the necessary preconditions for the signing 
of agreements between Israel and the other Arab countries taking 
part in the peace process, preserving and guaranteeing the 
balance of interests of all Middle East states, the declaration 
of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry reads.

<F P=106> [Report by Ekaterina Kazasova] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, May 3 (BTA) -- Today's talks between 
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and his Indonesian 
counterpart Ali Alatas focused on the further development of 
relations between Bulgaria and Indonesia and on bilateral 
economic cooperation in particular. Mr. Ali Alatas arrived here 
on a two-day official visit today. The two sides are not 
expected to sign bilateral documents during the visit. 
  There are no political problems between the two countries, 
Mr. Alatas said upon his arrival, a statement later confirmed by 
his Bulgarian counterpart. We have already established 
cooperation on many problems at international forums and we have 
similar stands on a number of issues, Mr. Alatas said. We will 
focus on the possibilities for deepening economic cooperation 
and will seek ways to a further improvement of our relations, 
the Indonesian foreign minister said. 
  Later on Mr. Alatas described his meeting with the Bulgarian 
minister as very useful. The meeting continued an hour longer 
than scheduled. The two sides discussed bilateral relations and 
possibilities for promoting cooperation between the two 
countries and exchanged opinions on some regional problems. 
  The two sides shared the opinion that it is necessary to 
broaden economic cooperation and trade between Bulgaria and 
Indonesia, Mr. Alatas said after the meeting. The two ministers 
agreed that the present trade is far below the potentials of the 
two countries. It was agreed that the next session of the joint 
Bulgarian-Indonesian Committee, which held its first session in 
1990, should be held as soon as possible. The two countries 
have already signed several basic agreements: a trade agreement 
and an agreement on avoiding double taxation. "We agreed that 
to these we should add an agreement on reciprocal investment 
protection," which will be signed soon," Mr. Alatas said. After 
the successful visit to Indonesia of a Bulgarian delegation 
headed by Trade Minister Valentin Karabashev a similar 
Indonesian delegation will visit Bulgaria, the Indonesian 
foreign minister said. 
  Economic contacts are most important in our bilateral 
relations, the Bulgarian foreign minister said in response to a 
question on the results of the meeting. According to Foreign 
Minister Daskalov both sides wish to establish more regular 
contacts -- both as regards bilateral relations and at 
international forums in areas of mutual interest. From the 
economic point of view, Bulgaria is of interest to Indonesia not 
so much as a market, which is quite far removed, but rather as 
an opportunity for coming out on third markets -- the former 
Soviet republics and the countries of the Balkan region. 
Bulgaria has already gained experience and can provide transport 
for a joint coming out on third markets, Mr. Daskalov said. 
  Tomorrow the Indonesian Foreign Minister will be received by 
President Zhelyu Zhelev and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and will 
meet parliamentary leaders. Before leaving Bulgaria Mr. Alatas

<F P=106> [Report by Mariya Barutchieva] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, May 3 (BTA) -- Bulgaria will close a 
favourable deal on its debt to the London Club of commercial 
banks, both in terms of prices and time, Finance Minister Stoyan 
Aleksandrov said upon his return from Paris today. The minister 
over the second half of April made a tour of six world finance 
centres (Frankfurt, Vienna, Rome, Tokyo, New York, and Paris) to 
present the deal on Bulgaria's commercial debt and prospects for 
debt-for-equity swaps. Mr. Aleksandrov said many creditors 
accepted Bulgaria's proposal to repurchase at least 20 percent 
of its foreign debt or about $1.5 billion. In March the 
Bulgarian side suggested a price of 25 cents per dollar in 
foreign debt. The debt-for-equity and repurchase options are 
aimed to halve this country's $8.7 billion debt to the London 
Club. 
  Finance Minister Aleksandrov described as "very interesting" 
the World Bank's and the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) 
willingness to provide additional financing for the whole amount 
to be repurchased. Beside amounts agreed, these two 
institutions pledged an additional $255 million ($130 million 
from the World Bank and $125 million from the IMF) just for the 
commercial debt deal. This means there would be no ceiling for 
the amount to be repurchased, said the Finance Minister. 
According to IMF estimates, this country needs some $900 
million for the deal (for the collateral and repurchase). $400 
million are needed only for repurchasing the amount already 
negotiated. 
  Finance Minister Aleksandrov voiced a regret that the 
Bulgarian side has failed to meet the net bank assets 
requirement in the standby agreement with the IMF. According to 
Mr. Aleksandrov, this raises doubts about the June 30, 1994, 
deadline for the conclusion of the deal. The finance minister 
said talks on the finalization of the deal would "make no sense" 
unless Parliament amends the Privatization Act or passes a 
bankruptcy law by June 30. 
  According to him, Bulgaria can ensure the deal's conclusion 
in several ways; one option is to use $200 million from the 
state reserves, which, within a short period of time (a couple 
of months), should not heighten tension on the forex market. 
Many financial institutions have offered support. Thus Meryll 
Lynch seems willing to agree to finance the deal at a 3-percent 
annual interest for three months, which the finance minister 
sees as very favourable terms. 
  As to which bank should act as a foreign debt agent, 
Aleksandrov thinks it should be the central Bulgarian National 
Bank, as it has reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal 
Reserve Board for the American side to buy the collateral. 
  High interest was shown in debt-for-equity swaps. The 
finance minister said that it would be possible to use foreign 
debt bonds as an instrument of payment in the privatization of 
enterprises up for sale, and in the opening of privatization 
procedures for companies, which have drawn investor interest. 
Thus, French companies have displayed interest in 30 to 40 
Bulgarian companies in the foods and tourist industries and 
Meryll Lynch and Salomon Brothers in large investment in the 
energy sector and telecommunications. Large infrastructure 
units such as airports, ports, roads, etc., have also attracted 
attention. The Bulgarian side suggested that creditors consider 
medium-size, export-oriented and slow-asset [as received] 
companies and large corporate taxpayers, said Reneta Indzhova, 
Privatization Agency boss who accompanied the finance minister 
on his tour. According to Indzhova, a major obstacle is the 
lack of Council of Ministers regulation of the way to make 
foreign debt payments through bonds. I count on this option to 
give a strong boost to privatization, Indzhova said. 
  According to Minister Aleksandrov, the deal now depends on 
home policy and the economy's performance. He said he would not 
act as a stooge for any political force. According to him, the 
latest developments in Bulgaria have had negative repercussions, 
which transpired in the cancellation of an European Union 
mission visit. This spells a delay in pledged EU financing, 
Aleksandrov said.

  [Text] Sofia, May 3 (BTA) -- The Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP), supporting the government, insists that parliament 
discuss the cabinet's economic and social policy together with 
the report of the National Bank, said BSP Executive Committee 
member Doncho Konakchiev at a press conference today. According 
to him, within the next few days Prime Minister Lyuben Berov 
will propose concrete personnel and structural changes in the 
cabinet. The premier announced his intentions to make changes 
in the cabinet last Wednesday [27 April] in a declaration before 
parliament. 
  We are in touch with Prime Minister Berov and we hope he 
will 
keep his promises -- to restore dialogue with the trade unions, 
to make cost-of-living adjustments, to consolidate the foreign 
exchange and financial market, and strengthen national security, 
Mr. Konakchiev said. 
  The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) will 
consider 
its next steps at the end of parliamentary Easter recess, when 
the future of Lyuben Berov's Cabinet will become clearer, the 
top leadership of the coalition decided at its regular session 
today. Within a week the parties in the SDS will make proposals 
how to provoke the resignation of the cabinet and early 
parliamentary elections. 
  The government has come under serious trade union pressure. 
If Prime Minister Berov starts structural reforms without 
parliament's support, the Confederation of Independent Trade 
Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) will block them, KNSB leader Prof. 
Krustyu Petkov said at a briefing today. The KNSB has called a 
warning general strike for tomorrow as part of the preparations 
for its general strike scheduled to start on May 17. The local 
structures of the other major trade union amalgamation -- 
Podkrepa -- will also take part in protest actions. The trade 
unions demand cost-of-living adjustment of the incomes of the 
population after prices doubled in two months with the steep 
slide of the lev against the U.S. dollar and the introduction of 
value-added tax on April 1. Prof. Krustyu Petkov said today 
that he expects 934 enterprises with over 200,000 workers to 
take part in the warning strike. 
  The KNSB also demands the coordination and adoption of a 
state policy for stabilizing the foreign exchange market, 
clarity on the protection of Bulgarian producers, and 
transparency regarding the obligations undertaken by Bulgaria to 
the international institutions. In a letter to Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov European Confederation of Trade Unions Secretary 
General Emilio Gabaglo expressed support for the KNSB. Mr. 
Gabaglo has sent his personal adviser Peter Seideneck to observe 
the observation of the rights of the strikers during the warning 
strike. 
  This morning Prime Minister Lyuben Berov assured Prof. 
Petkov 
over the phone of his readiness to start negotiations on May 11 
and to personally head the delegation of the government (on 
which the KNSB insisted). This was announced today by the 
leader of the confederation. "However, the beginning of 
negotiations does not mean stopping strike actions," Prof. 
Petkov said. In an interview for today's issue of the PARI 
financial news daily, Prof. Petkov says that Prime Minister 
Berov is ready to make maximum compromises in order to reach an 
agreement. However, according to the KNSB leader, the stands of 
the Prime Minister and the KNSB on protecting the savings of the 
population and local production are diametrically opposed.

  [Text] Sofia, May 4 (BTA) -- A total of 500 computer 
viruses were identified in Bulgaria only within about an year, 
which makes an average of two viruses per day. All state 
institutions -- parliament, cabinet and the president's office 
-- last year were subject to information terrorism three to five 
times, BTA learned from Mr. Evgeni Nikolov, head of the computer 
security lab with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAN). An 
international conference on information protection is currently 
being held in Varna (on the Black Sea). 
  An unidentified writer penetrated the Finance Ministry 
computers precisely when the 1994 national budget was being 
drafted, it became known at the conference. The National Bank 
of Bulgaria (BNB), too, just like all major commercial banks, 
was troubled by viruses. Jack the Ripper was the most dangerous 
of the viruses traced and broken by the BAN computer security 
experts, Mr. Nikolov said. It appeared last September in 
Bulgaria and caused serious damages after penetrating about 70 
percent of the computers. "While we were ready to beat it 
within about a fortnight, it took the other affected countries 
three months longer to solve this problem," Mr. Nikolov also 
said. 
  Statistical figures set the number of operating computers in 
this country at over 1 million. The experts working at the 
anti-virus lab with the BAN are 11 and only within an year they 
have developed some 1,000 anti-virus packages. They, however, 
have to sell their products cheap to prove they are not writing 
computer viruses as a means to provide a market for the 
anti-virus products. 
  Bulgaria has highly qualified computer experts. It is 
generally believed that some of the unbreakable viruses, 
including the Dark Avenger, are Bulgarian-made. According to 
Mr. Nikolov, however, it makes no sense blaming one nation or 
another and the anti-Bulgarian campaign in this sector is losing 
its vigour.

  [Text] Prague, May 3 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus said on Czech Radio today that changes in the Czech 
Government were only natural and their number was not excessive 
as compared with stabilized West European states. He was 
commenting on Petr Pitha's resignation as education minister 
last Wednesday and his replacement by Ivan Pilip yesterday. Both 
are members of the Christian Democratic Party (KDS). Klaus said 
that health reasons were really behind Pitha's resignation. 
  Pitha is the third minister to leave the present government 
which emerged from the June 1992 elections. The other leavers 
were Health Minister Petr Lom (Civic Democratic Party, ODS) and 
Culture Minister Jindrich Kabat (Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL). Both were 
criticized for their performance as ministers. 
  Asked whether the government was considering the dismissal 
of 
Tomas Jezek, chairman of the National Property Fund (FNM), and 
whether this step would harm coupon privatization as indicated 
by some dailies, Klaus said: "The idea that coupon privatization 
could be threatened by the dismissal of one person belongs in 
the category of jokes." "Tomas Jezek's future in this or 
another post is by no means connected with coupon 
privatization," Klaus stressed. 
  Speculations about the dismissal or resignation of Jezek 
(Civic Democratic Alliance, ODA) appeared especially in 
connection with the last scandals accompanying the sales of the 
shares of some enterprises held by the FNM. 
  Klaus also dismissed speculations that he or the government 
coalition would have discussed Jezek's firing as "simply 
erroneous." He added that he himself learnt only from the press 
that a majority of the members of the FNM governing body were 
starting to consider Jezek's dismissal. 
  On Saturday the left-orientated daily RUDE PRAVO, referring 
to an unnamed "coalition source", wrote that Klaus, together 
with Deputy Premier Jan Kalvoda (ODA) and Privatization Minister 
Jiri Skalicky (ODA) had decided on Thursday not to dismiss Jezek 
for the time being. According to the paper, the dismissal was 
demanded by six out of the nine members of the FNM governing 
body, chaired by Skalicky.

  [Text] Prague May 4 (CTK) -- Two Czech opposition parties, 
the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) and the 
Liberal National Social Party (LSNS), will have to leave the 
publishing ventures in which they are shareholders, the Czech 
agricultural daily ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY writes today. 
  On April 29, parliament approved a bill forbidding political 
parties and movements from raising money other than through 
membership fees, gifts, loans and credits, and lease of 
property. The KSCM owns a majority stake in Futura, a company 
which publishes HALO NOVINY, and the LSNS owns 93 percent of 
shares of Melantrich, a company publishing the daily SVOBODNE 
SLOVO. KSCM spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova says that the KSCM will 
respect the law and is already taking steps to comply with it 
but may still appeal against it at the Constitutional Court, the 
paper writes. The law on political parties gives them until 
June 1, 1995, to comply. 
  "The KSCM considers the law to be discriminatory against the 
opposition parties," Zezulkova says, adding that another point 
the party is taking to courts is the redistribution of state 
subsidies to political parties, which she says "has altered 
election results and ignored the voters." "The situation is 
ripe for early elections," Zezulkova says in ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY. 
  The future of the LSNS' stake in Melantrich will only be 
decided at an LSNS conference to be held in April or May 1995, 
the paper quotes LSNS Political Secretary Jaroslav Jurkovic as 
saying. One of the ways out might be to distribute the 42,000 
shares among the party members, Jurkovic says, recalling a 
similar move by the Czechoslovak Socialist Party after the 
Second World War, when the party gave out Melantrich shares to 
"reliable members." The LSNS will not lose its grip on the 
orientation of SVOBODNE SLOVO, Jurkovic says in ZEMEDELSKE 
NOVINY.

  [Text] Prague, May 3 (CTK) -- The new minister should 
avoid partial and political pressures, and not give in to them, 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said at today's official 
inauguration of new Education Minister Ivan Pilip. The new 
minister should perceive the problems of such an important 
ministry as a whole, Klaus added. 
  Pilip, 30, was appointed to the post on May 2, replacing 
Petr 
Pitha who resigned on April 27 for health reasons. Both of them 
are members of the coalition Christian Democratic Party (KDS, 10 
deputies in the 200-member Czech Parliament). Pilip has been 
the party's chairman since December 1993. 
  The problems of education should be taken into account in 
the 
drafting of a law on powers of higher administrative units, 
Klaus said. The relevant document, which will devolve powers in 
the educational area from the center to the regions, will be 
compiled by the end of May, he reported. During the ceremony, a 
letter from Pitha sharing his experience with the ministerial 
work was read.

  [Text] Prague, May 2 (CTK) -- Danish Foreign Minister 
Niels Petersen, who arrived for a visit today, told journalists 
that he and Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec had discussed 
the expansion of the European Union (EU). He said the Danish 
Government considered it important that the EU remain an open 
organization and that was why it intensively tried to arrive at 
an agreement between the EU and Sweden, Norway, Finland and 
Austria. Petersen said he hoped that these countries would 
become EU members as of January 1, 1995, thus opening up a new 
EU chapter of extending eastwards. 
  The Danish Government is determined to seek the EU's 
extension to Central and East European states, including the 
Czech Republic, and considers it very significant, Petersen 
said. The government welcomes the Czechs' effort at joining 
this organization, he added. 
  Zieleniec said he and Petersen devoted much time to an 
analysis of the situation in Europe, to security issues and 
prospects of the United States-proposed Partnership for Peace 
program for European security. The Czech side is prepared to 
make use of the project for cooperation between the two 
countries' Armies and Defense Ministries. He said it was also 
important that small states mutually cooperate in the security 
sphere. 
  Petersen labelled the two countries' relations as excellent. 
Both ministers also pointed to increasing mutual trade and 
Denmark's active role in bilateral trade and economic relations. 
Also discussed was a potential visit to the Czech Republic by 
the Queen of Denmark. Tomorrow, Petersen will leave for 
Slovakia.

  [Text] Prague, May 2 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec said today Prague espoused both the goals of the 
European stability and security pact and the apprehension that 
developments in Europe be not affected by tension between 
individual states over various problems, including ethnic 
minorities. 
  Speaking after a meeting with his Danish counterpart Niels 
Petersen, Zieleniec stressed the need to treat the pact most 
responsibly and cautiously. It is necessary to realize that 
ill-prepared moves can be "counterproductive" and that they 
could unleash processes leading to instability instead of 
stability. 
  The security and stability pact for Europe was submitted by 
French Premier Edouard Balladur in June 1993. It is designed to 
secure stability and security in Europe, to protect economic and 
trade interests of individual countries and to produce 
agreements on good neighborhood and respect for ethnic 
minorities's rights. The pact would be signed by European 
states, the United States and Canada. 
  Petersen said his government considered the pact a good and 
constructive idea. European countries need to solve some 
problems with their neighbors and this is a sort of 
"preventative diplomacy," he said. Admitting that this may not 
be easy, Petersen added the pact could be a valuable 
contribution to stability in Europe. He recalled that the 
conference on the pact is to open in Paris at the end of May and 
that the pact could be signed in Paris in the spring of 1995.

  [Text] Prague, May 2 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic wants to 
join the European Union as an individual entity, not as part of 
Central Europe, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told Danish Foreign 
Minister Niels Petersen today. Ivana Plechata from the 
Government Office told CTK that Klaus and Petersen also agreed 
that the developments in the former Yugoslavia had to be viewed 
rationally, not emotionally. They noted that the conflict had 
to be treated seriously, but that it was not possible to make 
far-reaching political conclusions. 
  In a meeting with President Vaclav Havel Petersen, who 
arrived for an official visit today, said he comprehended 
certain impatience of people in the Czech Republic in relation 
to the country's admission to the European Union (EU). He 
stressed his government was ready to support small European 
countries in their effort at integration into the EU. 
  Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said in 
his 
talks with Petersen that the Czech Republic was satisfied with 
the development of trade with Denmark. Exports to Denmark rose 
by $37.1 million in the years 1992-93. Denmark's surplus 
decreased from $30 million in 1992 to a mere $3 million last 
year, Dlouhy said. 
  Petersen also met today with Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde 
and other leading parliamentary representatives.

  [Text] Prague, May 2 (CTK) -- The first session of the 
Czech-Iranian commission at the level of ministers, at which 
current issues concerning economic and trade relations are to be 
discussed, started today in Prague. Heavy Industry Minister 
Nezhad-Hoseynian is at the head of the Iranian delegation, and 
Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy is at the head of 
the Czech delegation, Dlouhy's office told CTK. The mixed 
commission should also discuss Iranian debts owing to Czech 
businesses. 
  According to earlier information from the Foreign Ministry, 
the debts are linked to long-term projects contracts for which 
had been concluded in the past under terms not much advantageous 
for the then Czechoslovakia. The debts now stand at about $20 
million and the amount is further increasing. Dlouhy told CTK 
today that he hoped that at least a basic agreement would be 
reached on the problem. 
  The Czech delegation is made up of representatives of the 
Trade and Industry, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Transport, 
Economy, and Agriculture Ministries. The commission was 
constituted on the basis of an intergovernmental trade agreement 
signed on October 2, 1993, when Dlouhy was on an official visit 
to Iran. The commission will receive Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus tomorrow. The Iranian delegation will leave Prague on May 
5.

  [Text] Budapest, 3 May (MTI) -- "Over the past few weeks, 
Hungarian Television has hurled a plethora of slanders at me and 
used patently false witnesses for the purpose," Hungarian 
Socialist Party (HSP) Chairman Gyula Horn said in a statement 
sent to MTI today. "I will confirm again that I did not beat 
anyone and committed no illegal acts, either during or after 
1956. I stand before the electorate with a clear conscience," 
he said. 
  HSP Chairman Horn said he has established that the bulk of 
the blame for the mud-slinging campaign against himself and the 
HSP lies with the government that exercises control over 
Hungarian Television, and with the senior politicians and 
parties of the governing coalition. 
  The document states that the Socialists do not wish to apply 
unworthy means to succeed; on the contrary, they seek national 
reconciliation. It goes on to say that should the electorate 
put their confidence in the Socialists, they will make every 
effort to ensure that the change in government takes place in 
keeping with European standards. 
  HSP Acting Deputy President Imre Szekeres said that over the 
past few weeks Hungarian Television aired incredibly spiteful 
statements and that this practice must be brought to a halt. 
The party has resolutely protested even before this time, and 
now Horn has called for a greater deal of calm and fair-play, 
Szekeres said.

  [Text] Budapest, 3 May (MTI) -- A lot of people live in 
worse circumstances than during the last few years of the Kadar 
regime, yet the country should continue along the path that it 
chose in 1990, Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] prime 
ministerial candidate Viktor Orban told a forum of the Fidesz in 
Szolnok on Tuesday [3 May]. 
  Despite disillusionment and pessimism, the past four years 
can by no way be regarded as wasted time. In this parliamentary 
cycle the country made more progress than ever before in this 
century, Orban said. If the politicians of the former regime 
return after the elections, many people will be bitterly 
disappointed again, the politician said.

  [Text] Budapest, 3 May (MTI) -- Over 1,000 people 
demonstrated silently in front of the Budapest center of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] on Tuesday evening, urging 
voters to remember the Socialist past and calling for party 
chief Gyula Horn's resignation. Spokeswoman Nora Keresztes read 
out a statement every 15 minutes to warn that "ignorance or 
forgetfulness might bring bad decisions with grave 
consequences". The statement urged Socialist Party Chairman 
Gyula Horn to examine his past and abandon politics and the MSZP 
chairmanship.

  [Text] Budapest, May 3 (MTI) -- It is wrong to say that the 
elections will decide between the Hungarian Socialists (MSZP) 
and the Hungarian Democratic Forum, Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ) Prime Minister Candidate Gabor Kuncze told the press in 
Kapuvar on Tuesday [3 May]. Voters will almost certainly remove 
the present coalition, so the real question is whether the 
Hungarian Socialists or the Free Democrats get the authority to 
replace them, Kuncze said. The SZDSZ has a good chance and is 
attracting growing support, he added. 
  Some television programmes were openly biased against 
certain 
parties, Kuncze claimed. The SZDSZ would follow a different 
government policy and would involve the future opposition more. 
His party wants to see more control for Parliament over the 
Cabinet. 
  He said that expecting miracles from the elections was 
dangerous for the stability of the country and blamed the MSZP 
for doing nothing to protect people from illusory hopes. He 
also promised that between the first and second round of the 
elections the SZDSZ would not expand inter-party cooperation 
beyond the liberal bloc. 
  The Boross-Moravcik meeting showed continuity, he said: the 
Slovaks were ready to improve bilateral relations.

  [Text] Budapest, 3 May (MTI) -- The first freely elected 
Hungarian parliament in forty years, convened on May 2, 1990, 
ended its work on April 7, 1994, after 378 days of sessions. In 
this time, deputies passed 432 laws that created and expanded 
the framework of a democratic law-governed state, continued the 
creation of a social market economy, and accelerated the 
emergence of capitalist property relations. 
  One of the most important laws passed, regulated on 
compensation, as a result of which 670,000 people acquired about 
one-third of the arable land, and two-fifths of the forests. 
The minority law ensures extensive personal, cultural, and 
administrative autonomy to the ethnic and national minorities 
that account for about one-tenth of the Hungarian population. 
  Under the 1989 electoral law approved in the former system, 
176 of the 386 deputies in the single-chamber Parliament were 
elected from individual constituencies, 152 from regional lists, 
and 58 from national lists. 
  An electoral majority made it possible for the conservative, 
Christian parties to form a government. The ruling center-right 
coalition, first led by Prime Minister Jozsef Antall, then, 
following his death in December 1993, by Prime Minister Peter 
Boross, initially consisted of 165 deputies of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum (MDF), 44 deputies of the Independent 
Smallholders+ Party (FKGP), and 21 deputies of the Christian 
Democratic People"s Party (KDNP). The opposition parties were 
the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) with 94 deputies, 
the liberal Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ) with 22 
deputies, and the Hungarian Socialist Party with 33 deputies. 
Apart from these six parties, seven independent deputies also 
won seats. (The proportions changed significantly over the four 
years, the government majority was reduced to a minimum, the 
number of independent deputies rose fourfold, and new party 
groups were set up.) 
  There were very few professional politicians among the 358 
men and 28 women deputies, but very many with higher 
qualifications: 244 deputies had had professional careers, 80 
scientific careers, 20 were entrepreneurs or farmers, and only 
10 were from the former political elite. As regards their 
former occupations, 33 deputies were researchers, 27 lawyers, 22 
hospital doctors, 21 company managers, 20 journalists, 17 
university professors or secondary school teachers. 
  In order to increase government stability, the two strongest 
parties agreed with each other at the end of April, 1990, on the 
principles for a partial amendment of the Constitution, which 
was approved by deputies. The parts of the amendemnt which 
affected Parliament were the election of the President by 
deputies (Arpad Goncz has been President of the Republic since 
1990), and that the scope of authority of the president extends, 
under certain conditions, to the dissolution of Parliament. 
Parliament elects the prime minister, the president appoints 
the ministers on the proposal of the prime minister. An 
absolute majority (50 percent of deputies plus one vote) is 
needed to elect a prime minister, or for a no- confidence vote 
against him. A constructive no-confidence motion (supported by 
one-fifth of the deputies, also having to include the name of 
the new prime ministerial candidate) can be submitted only 
against the prime minister. 
  The legal measure in force lists 20 basic institutions and 
basic rights for which qualified, two-thirds majority is needed 
(that is votes from two-thirds of the deputies) to amend them. 
These include changes to the Constitution, making peace 
agreements, and declaring war or states of emergency. 
  These created the unique features of Hungarian 
parliamentarism, which shifted the focus of legislation from the 
English model to the German "chancellorship" model. With the 
two-thirds majority laws, the Constitution also ensured 
legislative rights to the opposition. Apart from the general 
principle of government accountability, parliamentary control 
also includes a reporting obligation for the government and 
certain of its ministers. However, with the introduction of the 
conservative no-confidenc vote, the government can be 
overthrowin only through the person of the prime minister. A 
characteristic element in preparation of laws is that the role 
of parliamentary groups is greater than that of parliamentary 
committees. However, the House rules provide extensive 
opportunities for control by institutionalizing questions to the 
prime minister and ministers, political debates, contributions 
before the session, and submitting amendment proposals.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 3 -- President Lech Walesa on Tuesday 
told diplomatic corps accredited to Warsaw that a "real and full 
European integration has become possible thanks to the victory 
of democracy" in our continent. "The integration is favoured by 
such initiatives as the Partnership for Peace. Poland expresses 
the hope that it will become a road towards the creation of an 
efficient European security system," Walesa said at a meeting 
held at the royal castle on the occasion of the national day of 
Poland, the 3rd of May constitution anniversary. 
  "Regional cooperation also brings us closer to the united 
and 
safe Europe," Walesa stressed and added that Poland attaches 
importance to the Visegrad group and the Council of the Baltic 
Countries and the regional meeting at Litomysl. 
  The Polish president spoke of Poland's "frequent and 
significant contacts with Washington, and also Bonn, London and 
Paris" and said: "We are of the opinion that the role of the 
United States in maintaining European stability should not be 
weakened. At the same time we attach great weight to 
cooperation with democratic Russia. Our proposal to codify the 
principles of the Eastern policy serves this end. Through 
discussions with our partner we are trying to open the road 
towards concrete solutions." 
  Apart from President Walesa and his wife Danuta, the meeting 
was hosted by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, Sejm Speaker Jozef 
Oleksy, Senate Speaker Adam Struzik and Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski. On behalf of the diplomats the dean of the 
Diplomatic Corps, Papal Nuncio Archbishop Jozef Kowalczyk 
expressed recognition to the Polish president and the Polish 
people for their "everyday toil and struggle for a new shape of 
the democratic country."

  [Text] Elblag, May 3 -- The leader of the national 
commission of the "Solidarity" trade union Marian Krzaklewski 
asked union members on Tuesday to support Solidarity's struggle 
for "the right system in our country". 
  During the meeting with 200 unionists in Elblag, Krzaklewski 
emphasised that "in Silesia hundreds of thousands of people are 
protesting against the incorrect realisation of the reforms and 
the system which causes our families to become impoverished." 
Krzaklewski said that he believes in the wisdom of workers and 
challenged them not to be afraid of the comments of "the parties 
and unions in power." The union leader said he did not support 
the idea of this particular constitution being approved by a 
parliament which is in its majority composed of post-Communists.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 3 -- Strikes at 16 coal and 3 zinc and 
lead mines were continuing on Tuesday. The strikes are 
"absentee" strikes which means the miners are not at their 
places of work. 
  The chairmen of Solidarity factory committees in the mines 
and power stations met on Tuesday evening to discuss the forms 
further strike action would take. According to one of the union 
representatives who wished to remain anonymous Solidarity will 
be escalating the strikes in mining. The source said a decision 
to this effect would be taken on Wednesday during a meeting of 
the Slasko-Dabrowski regional Solidarity leadership in Katowice. 
  The strike at Poland's lignite (brown coal) mines was 
suspended on Saturday. Power stations are not limiting 
electricity supplies.

  [Text] Katowice, May 3 -- Freedom Union leader Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki said during a Tuesday press conference in Katowice 
that the cause of the present tensions in Poland is the "policy 
of procrastination of the government, which has not taken up its 
own standpoint in light of many problems." He added that the 
"political echos of the present strike wave are not subject to 
doubt." According to Mazowiecki the "way to resolve the present 
problems in the country is to clearly define the standpoint of 
the government towards the most important national economic and 
social affairs." 
  When speaking about the strike wave, the Freedom Union 
leader 
said that he wonders why "those who now say that they are 
striking in the name of Solidarity in support of the state 
enterprise pact not so long ago undermined a government which 
created the pact." According to Mazowiecki, "it is unjust that 
all of society suffer due to a strike staged by a narrow social 
group such as that of the coal miners in Belchatow."

  [Textz] Warsaw, May 4 -- Strikes, especially those in the 
strategic industries, also pose a danger to the country, 
President Lech Walesa on Wednesday told the cabinet members that 
meet to discuss security problems. 
  According to the president, the fact that not everybody is 
on 
strike and not everybody should pay for strikes should be 
established through negotiations and by a social agreement so 
that the trade unions are not suprised. Walesa stressed that it 
should not be allowed that the strategic elements of the economy 
be paralysed since it also is dangerous for the country.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 4 -- Leaders of five right-wing parties 
criticised the ruling coalition at a press conference on 
Wednesday for attempts to politically subordinate the public 
television. Representatives of the Real Politics Union (UPR), 
the Conservative Party (PK), the Party of Christian Democrats 
(PChD), the Peasant-Christian Party (SLCh) and the 
National-Democratic Party (SND) believe that the coalition aims 
to recall members of the National TV and Radio Council and the 
board of the public television. 
  According to PK leader Aleksander Hall, the process leads to 
the return of the monopoly on information in TV and "must be 
regarded as an attempt on freedom." Hall stressed that such 
tendencies are particularly visible in the present situation in 
the country, tense because of strikes. 
  Hall also pointed to the fact that the way of thinking of 
the 
coalition is the legacy of the communist regime, when the mass 
media were considered to serve the ruling authorities. "We 
defend the principle of the independence of the mass media from 
the current leadership of the state," Hall added. 
  Stanislaw Michalkiewicz from the UPR emphasised that the 
public television lives on taxpayer's money and no political 
power can claim to rule over this medium. "Television is not 
supposed to pay compliments to the authorities but to broadcast 
news", Michalkiewicz said.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 4 -- Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy during a 
Wednesday meeting with diplomats to mark the 203 anniversary of 
the May 3rd constitution said that the "Polish parliament is 
very actively trying to build and co-create, in concert with the 
government and the president, solid Polish-foreign relations." 
Oleksy said that democratic parliaments as the representatives 
of societies bring nations closer together via their contacts." 
He also invited diplomats to a Sejm debate devoted to Polish 
foreign policy, which will take place on May 12. 
  Oleksy pointed out that the Polish "parliament, in its 
international activity, is an important part of the state's 
foreign policy and at the same time it implements this policy." 
Oleksy stressed that the processes of market and democratic 
reforms in Poland will be continued irrevocably and added that 
there is a political agreement on this matter. 
  "Poland has chosen a decisive Euro-Atlantic course in which 
she sees its strategic security and interests," stated Oleksy 
and added that this, however, does not lead to the restriction 
of Poland's strivings for building good relations with 
extra-European countries." 
  Dean of the diplomatc corps Papal Nuncio Archbishop Jozef 
Kowalczyk wished that parliamentarians adopt a constitution 
which would meet the expectations of the entire modern society 
... and which would grow to be an inspiration for other 
generations and people, as the May 3rd contitution had once 
been."

  [Text] Warsaw, May 3 -- Senator Jan Mulak was reelected 
leader of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) on the second day of 
the 30th PPS congress on Tuesday. According to PPS press 
spokesman Andrzej Ziemski the congress marked the final stage in 
the unification of the independent PPS, the reborn PPS and Jan 
Mulak's PPS. Leaders of all the fractions were elected to the 
party leadership. 
  The PPS led by Piotr Ikonowicz which has 3 parliamentary 
deputies was not represented at the congress. Miroslaw 
Krajewski who was elected chairman of the central executive 
committee hoped that Ikonowicz's PPS and the "Freedom, Equality, 
Independence" group would unite with the unified PPS during the 
second round of the congress in autumn. 
  The PPS supports the reform of the hitherto existing system 
in Poland wanting a far-reaching economic transformation. It 
does not accept that this has to be accompanied by growing 
poverty and stark social inequalities. 
  "If we do not work out a democratic method of social 
agreement for solving the most difficult problems we are 
threatened with the danger of anarchy or authoritarian 
government," the party programme states. 
  Krajewski blamed the government coalition for the current 
strikes. Guest at the congress, OPZZ Union Federation leader 
Ewa Spychalska said that Solidarity and the OPZZ had the same 
matters to sort out but Solidarity's methods (i.e. widespread 
strikes) were unacceptable. 
  Another guest at the congress, former OPZZ leader, now 
leader 
of the Movement of Working People (RLP), Alfred Miodowicz, 
stressed that the left had no character and that it apologised 
too much. Krajewski, who is a Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) 
parliamentary deputy, said that various colourful and 
well-defined groupings needed to be formed within the SLD if it 
was not to fall apart. 
  On Monday Mulak had stressed that the 30th congress was a 
continuation of the tradition of struggle for independence and 
socialism (the first PPS congress was held in 1892).

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/5/1994 -- Radu Campeanu has 
been acknowledged as legitimate president of the National 
Liberal Party (PNL) by virtue of a court sentence passed 
yesterday, 3 May, by the Bucharest Municipal Court, which ruled 
against a similar claim by the group led by Mircea 
Ionescu-Quintus. 
  The conflict between the two factions of the PNL, generated 
by the wish to reign supreme in the liberal movement, opposes 
Radu Campeanu, liberal member in the 1940's, repatriated in 1990 
after years of residence in France, who held the PNL 
chairmanship over 1990-1993, and ran for the presidency of 
Romania in 1990, to Mircea Ionescu-Quintus, lawyer and writer, 
liberal minister of justice in Mr. Theodor Stolojan's cabinet, 
1991-1992. 
  The conflict and tensions between these two factions and 
between them and other liberal splinter groups have inflicted, 
commentators observe, a negative image on Romania's main liberal 
party, which the 1990 elections had earned an important number 
of seats in the Parliament that functioned until the next 
elections of 1992 when it failed to gain the minimal share of 
votes for parliamentary representation. At that time, liberal 
leaders blamed the failure on Radu Campeanu's strong ego, who on 
the one hand decided to withdraw from the principal opposition 
bloc known as the Democratic Convention of Romania (CDR) and on 
the other blundered tragically proposing the former sovereign of 
Romania, Mihai I, who abdicated in 1947, as candidate for 
presidency, both moves meeting popular disagreement. 
  Starting from February 1994, PNL has had a bi-cephalous 
leadership, one being Mircea Ionescu-Quintus, elected PNL 
president in 1993, and the other Radu Campeanu, whom the 
"Campeanu" grouping designated as president of the National 
Liberal Party at an extraordinary congress. After this the 
story started of what the press called "the fight for the 
party's stamp" and the fight for the Bucharest central seat of 
the party, until the sides turned to the law for a verdict. 
  The resolution made yesterday by the Bucharest Municipal 
Court is practically the rejection of a contention lodged by the 
Quintus wing against a previous resolution. Mr. Quintus's group 
announced last evening that they would not abandon legal actions 
until the situation of the PNL was clarified and intimated that 
many PNL branches had extended them their support.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 3/5/1994 -- "We believe that 
some positive results have been obtained and Romania's relation 
with Germany is on the right track," said Chamber of Deputies 
Speaker Adrian Nastase at a press conference on Tuesday, 3 May, 
while assessing the results of a five-day visit in Germany made 
by a Romanian parliamentary delegation. 
  The members of the Romanian delegation consider they 
delivered to the German party a clear message stressing the 
interests Germany could have in this zone. In reply, the German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his next visit abroad would 
be in Romania. According to the delegation members, the German 
minister said Germany did not make discriminations between 
Romanian and the member countries of the Visegrad Group. 
  The members of the Romanian parliamentary delegation opined 
that Romania's relations with Germany must develop not only at 
federal level but also at the level of the lander, especially 
the Eastern ones.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
approved today the draft law on registration offices which makes 
it possible for the ethnic minorities to use their first names 
and surnames without having to adopt Slovak forms. The leaders 
of the 560,000 ethnic Hungarians have demanded that the law be 
passed. Its adoption was among the conditions Slovakia pledged 
to observe when it was admitted to the Council of Europe (CE) 
last June. The law in force, passed under former Meciar's 
cabinet, did not fully comply with the CE conditions. 
  The members of ethnic minorities will be allowed to write 
their first names and surnames as it is usual in their 
languages, Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner said. This means 
that the female surnames will not have to add the Slovak suffix 
"ova," and may retain the Hungarian suffix "ne." "Retroactive 
change in first names and surnames, stipulated by the law, will 
be free of charge," Pittner told CTK. 
  After the law is passed, there will remain only one unmet 
pledge to the CE: bilingual names of the communities inhabited 
by ethnic minorities. Last autumn Meciar's cabinet decided to 
remove bilingual (mostly Slovak-Hungarian) signposts, replacing 
them with only Slovak ones.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Chairman of the ethnic 
Hungarian Egyutteles movement Miklos Duray told CTK today he did 
not understand the Slovak Government's effort to get from 
Budapest official guarantees for the inviolability of the border 
from Budapest, as the question of Central European borders was 
already solved after World War Two. 
  "I cannot understand why it is necessary to insist on the 
demand for the recognition of the border," Duray said in an 
interview with CTK. He stressed that Slovakia was a successor 
to the former Czechoslovakia, and therefore all post-war 
agreements concluded by Czechoslovakia were valid. Duray said 
the fact that Hungary had confirmed the present border in its 
international agreement with Ukraine was due to the difference 
between Slovakia and Ukraine. The latter is not successor to a 
defunct state. 
  Duray welcomed the Sunday meeting between the Slovak and 
Hungarian premiers, Jozef Moravcik and Peter Boross, in 
Komarno-Komarom, a city located on both sides of the two 
countries' common border. 
  "It is correct that bilateral problems can be solved even 
without an international agreement," Duray said. He also said 
it was important that the new Slovak government, unlike the 
cabinet of Vladimir Meciar, did not make the opening of new 
border crossings conditional on the signing by Budapest of a 
readmission agreement on the return of illegal immigrants. 
"Although it is impossible to know the result of the second 
round of the parliamentary elections in Hungary beforehand, 
Boross's government will remain in power by the end of May," 
Duray said. Moravcik and Boross have concluded only a verbal 
agreement, he said, but added that he believed that the 
Hungarian foreign political line would be preserved after the 
elections. 
  He said he saw the signing of an agreement on the prevention 
of double taxation and creation of a mixed governmental 
commission for ethnic minorities as the most urgent goals in 
Slovak-Hungarian relations.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 30 (CTK) -- "The latest census 
has shown the size of small ethnic minorities to be dwindling," 
Democratic Left Party Deputy Pavol Bogdan says in an interview 
with the Slovak daily NARODNA OBRODA published today. A bill on 
ethnic minorities should be passed, Bogdan says in the paper, 
adding that reintroduction of small elementary schools with 
mixed-age classes should be one of the regulations aimed at 
stopping the declining use of the Ukrainian language. Mixed-age 
classes were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s, the paper says. 
  Parliament is to resume a discussion on the question of 
bilingual signs giving community names in Slovak and Hungarian, 
whose approval is one of the conditions for Slovakia's entry 
into the Council of Europe, the paper writes. The disagreement 
over a percentage limit for minorities is the snag that has so 
far prevented the passage of a bill saying that the existence in 
communities of minorities of 20 percent or larger justifies the 
use of dual-language signs. 
  This limit discriminates against Ukrainian, Ruthenian, 
German, and other small minorities that are most threatened with 
assimilation, leading to the loss of their national identity and 
self-awareness, Bogdan says in the paper.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Chairman of the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) Bela Bugar 
expressed today his party's maximum effort to run in elections 
in a triple coalition with the Egyutteles movement and the 
Hungarian Civic Party (MOS), two other parties of ethnic 
Hungarians in Slovakia. 
  "We want no Hungarian vote to be lost and left-wing forces 
to 
win in Slovakia," Bugar said. He added that the "left wing" 
means the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS, 
led by ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar), not the coalition 
Democratic Left Party (SDL). 
  The MKDH's partner -- the Egyutteles movement -- has not 
approved as yet the extension of the ethnic Hungarian coalition 
by the MOS, which, according to polls, is supported by less than 
one percent of the voters. The MKDH-Egyutteles coalition can 
rely on seven to nine percent of the voters. 
  Commenting on the alleged problem of one minister of the 
present government coalition with the screening law, Bugar said 
his MKDH would never support a government wanting to rescue its 
positively screened member at any cost. "If the speculations 
are confirmed, the minister must quit," Bugar emphasized. 
  The screening law, passed by the Czechoslovak parliament in 
1991, bars people linked to the former communist-run StB secret 
police, high Communist Party officials and members of the 
People's Militia from high government and economic posts until 
1996. The screening procedure is carried out by the Interior 
Ministry which issues certificates on whether or not a person 
was among those listed by the law. Speculations on the 
screening purity of one of the cabinet members, allegedly 
representative of the SDL, emerged in the press on Monday [2 
May]. The Hungarian coalition is not directly represented in 
the cabinet of Jozef Moravcik, but its support made possible 
this government's birth. 
  Bugar also pointed to the destructive methods applied by the 
ex-Prime Minister's HZDS in the parliament since the fall of the 
Meciar's government. According to Bugar, Meciar himself has 
called on his deputies to propose the dismissal of one cabinet 
member at each parliamentary session. The HZDS will always 
collect the 30 signatures necessary for opening discussion on 
the issue in parliament. This method aims to discredit 
parliament and "make the impression that it is unable to take 
positive steps," Bugar stressed. 
  Bugar's MKDH has five deputies in the 150-seat Slovak 
parliament.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Since last July, Slovak 
Radio (SRo) has received no state subsidies provided for by the 
law, SRo Director Vladimir Stefko told a press conference today. 
Although the law describes SRo as a "national, independent, 
public, informational, cultural and educational corporation", it 
monthly lacks 8 million korunas ($258,000) necessary for 
fulfilling its duties, Stefko said. If the critical situation 
is not solved, SRo could face a collapse in a short time, he 
added. 
  He pointed to the unnatural number of inspections, 
invectives, demands for staff changes and other interferences 
with the independence of SRo by state power. The previous 
government of Vladimir Meciar deprived SRo of 120 million 
korunas ($3,8 million) by direct interventions alone, he said. 
  The situation sharpened last September, when SRo had to 
resort to drastic measures for economic reasons. It abolished 
one of the three broadcasting circuits, almost halted the 
production of its own drama programs, regular popular programs 
were replaced by music, the broadcasting time was shortened, all 
investments were stopped. There is no more money for the 
modernization and maintenance of the equipment. The existence 
of the two SRo orchestras is also threatened, Stefko said. 
  Last year, SRo had to dismiss 160 editors and creative 
workers. The monthly wage of those remaining dropped by 1,500 
korunas ($48), and now it is an average of 4,500 korunas ($145). 
Stefko compared the subsidy of 30 million korunas (about $1 
million), earmarked for SRo by the present government with "the 
first pill of aspirin offered to a patient running a temperature 
of 40 degrees."

  [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- The government at 
today's session approved the proposal for a modification of the 
Market Regulation Fund in Agriculture, Agriculture Minister 
Pavel Koncos said at a press conference today. The fund should 
be financed by a 50 percent share from proceeds from 
privatization of agricultural companies and should start 
operating in June. 
  It will be administered through the National Bank of 
Slovakia 
by some of the banks that have granted loans to agricultural 
producers in the past. Koncos said Polnobanka (Agricultural 
Bank) and Vseobecna uverova banka (General Credit Bank) were 
under consideration. The fund is to provide money particularly 
for technological equipment for agricultural, forest and water 
management companies. 
  Koncos also said the ministry was working on food 
legislation 
which includes stricter criteria for inspecting the quality of 
food products, in line with European Union regulations. He said 
that Slovakia, in contrast to the Czech Republic, had already 
adopted a number of norms corresponding to regulations in the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which had also brought 
about the introduction of certificates on imported food products.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Denmark supports the 
European Union's expansion by Central and East European 
countries, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said 
after his talks with his Slovak counterpart Eduard Kukan today. 
Petersen, who arrived for a two-day visit to Slovakia, said 
that once Scandinavian states and Austria are admitted to the 
EU, "a long-term" need to expand the community eastwards would 
arise because union between West and East was the only guarantee 
of stability on the continent. 
  Asked by CTK whether Denmark preferred individual or joint 
entry of Central European countries into the EU, Petersen said 
the EU would apply the same model as in admitting the 
Scandinavian countries and Austria. The pattern is clear and 
logical: to conduct talks with each country separately, but 
simultaneously to the biggest measure possible, he stressed. 
  Petersen said that there were no problems in relations 
between Slovakia and Denmark, but added that trade was very low 
and cooperation other areas could also be promoted. Before 
Slovakia Petersen visited the Czech Republic.

problems existed between these two countries which would mar the 
promotion of cooperation. He said he also briefed his Indonesian 
partner on potential investments into Slovakia in view of access 
to third markets. 
  Alatas described the strengthening of economic relations as 
the aim of his two-day official visit to Slovakia which began 
yesterday. The conclusion of agreements in the future on the 
protection of investments and double-taxation could contribute 
to it, he added. Last year Slovakia exported to Indonesia 
machinery and chemical products amounting to 15 million USD, and 
imported from Indonesia tin, rubber and textiles worth 3.5 
million USD. 
  Alatas also met with Slovak Parliament Chairman Ivan 
Gasparovic and will be received by President Michal Kovac.

  [Text] Bratislava--An agreement on the formation of a 
right-wing Republican Bloc [Republikansky blok] was signed in 
Bratislava on 30 April by Ivan Duris, chairman of the Republican 
Party, and Jozef Horvath, chairman of the Association for the 
Republic-Republicans. In its program, the Republican Bloc 
demands the resignation of former Communists from government and 
other state administration posts. The government should submit 
a realistic economic program, based on the development of 
unemployment, and take resolute steps to reduce crime. The 
program also demands that the salaries of government members and 
National Council of the Slovak Republic deputies be lowered.

Candidates"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--At its meeting on 30 April the 
Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] Council authorized the KDH 
Presidium to enter into negotiations with representatives of 
right-wing groupings and personalities holding similar political 
views about their possible participation in the fall 
parliamentary elections on the KDH slate of candidates. In a 
resolution, the KDH Council called this decision "a realistic 
possibility of saving society from the threat of the onset of 
political extremism." KDH Deputy Chairman Ivan Simko specified 
that the KDH regards as right-wing groupings, to which the KDH 
Council's decision might apply, the Democratic Party, the 
National Democratic Party, the Party of Entrepreneurs and 
Tradesmen, and representatives of the Standing Conference of the 
Civic Institute. The KDH Council meeting also dealt with the 
basic theses of the KDH election manifesto and the mechanism of 
compiling slates of candidates. 
  [On the same day, on page 4, Bratislava SME in Slovak 
carries 
a 400-word Marian Bednar commentary entitled "Challenge." The 
commentator views the decision of the KDH Council of 30 April as 
an "unprecedented shift in the KDH's own way of thinking" and a 
"major breakthrough" because "vague statements about the 
integration of the right have assumed a far more specific 
shape." He believes that the KDH's "specific offer" will be 
accepted by "the followers of Cernak and Langos," by the former 
in view of their poor performance in preelection polls and by 
the latter because of "the nonexistence, following the demise of 
the Civic Democratic Union, of a political entity with which 
they would be ready to identify."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F>
Democratic Left, by Stefan Hrcka; place and date not given: 
"Discrimination in Privatization?"] 
  [Excerpts] At a meeting of the right-wing club in Zvolen 
on 27 April, Milan Janicina (National Democratic Party-New 
Alternative), minister for the administration and privatization 
of national property, said that privatization by means of 
so-called employee stock ownership would be applied only rarely. 
We asked Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the Democratic 
Left [SDL], whether this view is shared by the whole coalition. 
  [Weiss] I was surprised by this statement of the minister 
for the administration and privatization of national property, 
not because privatization by means of employee stock ownership 
is in the SDL's program but because the equality of all 
privatization methods is explicitly mentioned in the recent 
Policy Statement of the Slovak Government, which is the joint 
work of all coalition partners. This means that no method will 
be preferred or, on the other hand, suppressed. I also want to 
stress that the equality of privatization methods and procedures 
is also laid down in the valid law on large-scale privatization. 
[passage omitted] I would like to add that a number of 
decisions involving the privatization process belongs to the 
jurisdiction of the government as a whole and not just to that 
of individual ministers and ministries. 
  [Hrcka] In other words, no decision on excluding employee 
stock ownership from privatization has been made, and no 
discussion of this issue has taken place in the government 
coalition? 
  [Weiss] There has been no such decision. This is the 
personal view of the minister for the administration and 
privatization of national property. There are discussions in 
the government about the concept of privatization. This concept 
should be drawn up in cooperation between the Ministry for the 
Administration and Privatization of National Property and branch 
ministries. At any rate, the SDL will be pushing in the 
government for the equality of individual privatization methods. 
We will oppose administrative decisions made in advance, 
without an analysis of the situation of individual enterprises 
earmarked for privatization and without an evaluation of the 
quality of individual privatization projects, determining how 
many billions worth of property will be privatized by this or 
that method and, above all, decisions made in advance about 
which contenders or methods have better or poorer chances of 
being successful. After all, this is exactly what we criticized 
about the previous government.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Jancura: "Conversation With Anna </F>
Meciarova"] 
  [Text] Ladomerska Vieska, a hamlet in the shadow of Ziar 
nad Hronom and a mammoth aluminium works. The birthplace of the 
former prime minister and chairman of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. The last time I visited the house on 
the hill was two years ago. It was the same kind of time--early 
spring and before elections. Anna Meciarova was already 75 years 
old, but she had a lively interest in politics and was downright 
sparkling with humor--earthy, folksy, working-class humor. After 
all, she worked for 30 years in the Ziar factory, most of the 
time in the oxidization section. In the past two years, she has 
become stooped and sad. "Since Vlado was removed as prime 
minister," she says, "I have not watched television or read the 
newspapers." Last fall, her youngest son, Jaroslav, died 
unexpectedly of a fatal disease. He was only 38 years old. When 
we met for the last time, he was in charge of the basic SDL 
[Party of the Democratic Left] organization in their community. 
"There are only six of us here, but all are young people," he 
told me. I do not believe a rightist and a leftist could not get 
on together," he insisted even then, two years ago. "Only two 
idiots are incapable of coexistence." It appears that time is 
beginning to prove him right. 
  Anna Meciarova is not hiding her fear that she could lose 
her 
oldest son as well. "His enemies want to finish Vlado off," she 
repeats. As a mother, she does not believe one word of the 
accusations cast on her son in the parliament. "I brought up all 
of my sons equally well, and I love them all equally," she 
reminisces. "We had a hard life. My husband was a tailor, and I 
was training to be a seamstress, but, at the beginning of the 
1950's, they took away our business, took away our land, and 
designated us exploiters. Moreover, my husband was disabled and 
so was able to work only as a policeman. I worked in 
shifts--seven morning, seven afternoon, and seven night shifts. 
My husband also worked nights. Therefore, our children were 
often left to manage on their own and did not have much 
opportunity to enjoy parental love. Vlado was the oldest and 
therefore had to take care of his three brothers. When he 
graduated from high school, we sent him to study metallurgy in 
Kosice. But the local national committee gave him a bad 
evaluation--son of a small businessman. After five months, he 
had to come back home...." When did he last visit his family 
home? 
  "Two weeks ago. He placed flowers on the graves of his 
father 
and brother. They lie next to each other...." 
  Tears well up in Mother Meciarova's eyes, but she fights 
them 
back and changes the subject. She has recently recovered from a 
bad accident and is still hurting all over. Her daughter-in-law 
Mariena, Jaroslav's widow, takes care of her. When she leaves 
for work in the morning, she locks the gate--today one can never 
be sure. 
  In that two-year-old picture, A. Meciarova is standing in 
the 
garden behind their house, next to the cross with two arms that 
they put up in 1943 in honor of the Slovak Republic. Almost 50 
years later, in Bratislava, she participated in celebrating the 
birth of the second Slovak Republic. "At that time, they 
applauded Vlado with cries of hosanna, and today they want to 
crucify him? That can't be true." In parting she says: "Tell 
them in Bratislava that our people continue to believe in Vlado."

<F P=106> [Interview with Erno Rozsa, chairman of the Environmental </F>
Protection Committee of the Slovak parliament, by Peter Andor 
Balazs; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Balazs] You are the chairman of the Environmental 
Protection Committee of the Slovak parliament. What is your 
opinion about Mr. Binder's generous declaration, according to 
which he would gladly pump water into the Szigetkoz area? 
  [Rozsa] Mr. Binder also made such spectacular declarations 
before, as if he could solve the problem. These proposals would 
only be a patchwork because they do not change the basic 
problems. The basic problem is that, if the two states recognize 
the fact that the Danube is a border river, they have to also 
jointly bear its blessings, consequences, and threats. It is 
impossible to divide water; it is only possible to do something 
in this direction if one of the sides gives up his share by 
common agreement. When Julius Binder made his proposals, he did 
so for the benefit of the common property, but even if his plan 
succeeded, it would only be a sham solution. 
  [Balazs] The Bos-Nagymaros issue disturbs Hungarian-Slovak 
relations considerably. However, the Hungarian Green Party is 
urging the construction of the power stations at Dunakiliti and 
Nagymaros. What is your opinion of this, as chairman of the 
Environmental Protection Committee and a member of the 
Coexistence Movement? 
  [Rozsa] The recognition of differences is one of the major 
principles of Coexistence. A given country is trying to make use 
of this within its legal system for the benefit of the 
recognition of national minorities. Therefore, allow me not to 
interfere in the party struggles and the party concepts of 
another country. We will only get the guarantee of national 
minority recognition if we find the proper tone with the 
government at the given time and the given moment. If I speak 
about any of the political parties in Hungary, I will reopen the 
alleged or real wounds that threaten the constitutional 
guarantees of recognition of the ethnic Hungarians living here 
because we would again be accused of looking at Hungary and 
being led by Hungary. We could achieve results in the current 
political situation by not mentioning the facts and events 
outside the country. We are now preparing a law according to 
which large-scale projects cannot be carried out without the 
opinion of the public. The Slovak and Hungarian citizens living 
in the proximity of the dams should be the ones to express their 
opinions about the construction projects at Dunakiliti and 
Nagymaros, and, according to these opinions, one could say 
whether the project is good or bad. I detect a slight lack of 
responsibility in the fact that the Hungarian Green Party made 
declarations without being aware of these opinions. 
  [Balazs] What are the harmful environmental effects of the 
Bos power station on the Csallokoz area? 
  [Rozsa] Opinions differ on the level of the ground water at 
Csallokoz. Some people say that the level has increased; others 
say it has decreased. It is impossible to find this out in such 
a short time. 
  [Balazs] Do you find it unfair that, while the drinking 
water 
of 47,000 people in the Szigetkoz area is endangered, no 
noticeable damage whatsoever has emerged at the Csallokoz? 
  [Rozsa] We warned the Hungarians in time that the Slovaks 
would carry out the C version of the power station. You did not 
believe us at the time. The Slovak leadership made an issue of 
prestige out of this and mobilized all of its power to carry out 
this plan. With the construction of the power station at 
Dunakiliti, the distribution of water would have been in the 
Hungarians' hands. But the Hungarians rejected the idea and thus 
are now at the mercy of the Slovak side. 
  [Balazs] What chances of a joint solution do you see in the 
current situation? 
  [Rozsa] The basic concept of a broad coalition on this issue 
is that we must settle the conflict with our neighbors. We must 
negotiate. You must understand that our broad coalition is so 
diverse that it will be difficult to carry out this process. It 
is not easy for the right and the left to come to a consensus. 
The solution can only be found in something similar to what was 
recently said in Prague, with the participation of the 
environmental protection committees of nine Central European 
countries. National parks should be set up in natural areas 
divided by borders, and the affected countries would share the 
responsibility for them.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 
on 28 and 29 April carries two installments, both of which are 
on pages 1 and 3, 1,100 and 700 words, respectively, of an 
interview with Slovak Privatization Minister Milan Janicina by 
Peter Visvader on the second round of coupon privatization. The 
place and date of the interview are not given. The latter 
edition of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY also publishes, on page 2, a 
350-word TA SR report on a news conference on the second wave of 
privatization given by the same Privatization Minister Janicina 
in Bratislava on 28 March. 
  In the first installment of the interview, Janicina speaks 
about the "successful launching of coupon privatization being 
the number-one priority"; he goes on to say that "on 2 May, we 
move to Senec, where we are going to prepare privatization so 
that the list of enterprises offered in the second round can be 
published on 22 August. We expect the beginning of citizens and 
privatization funds registration on 1 September 1994. Before 
the end of our term of office, we intend to reach an 
irreversible stage in the launching of coupon privatization, 
regardless of election results." The most important thing to 
guarantee a smooth privatization process is uncequivocally, 
according to Janicina, "the precise processing of 
property-related legal documentation for the privatized 
enterprises." Asked about the criticism that coupon 
privatization does not provide the funds needed for developing 
the enterprises, the minister says that, "even within the 
framework of coupon privatization, it is possible to obtain 
capital by setting aside a part of the enterprise property for a 
direct sale." Furthermore, he argues, constant delays prevent 
the completion of individual projects of so-called wild 
privatization, and, in the process, they do not generate any 
capital, either. When the interviewer observes that the 
government has canceled 13 decisions made by its predecessor, 
"all of them projects within the framework of so-called wild 
privatization," and asks whether this trend is to continue, 
Janicina replies that "there were problems with privatization 
even earlier, but they became throughly obvious on 14 February." 
On the other hand, the minister says, "because of the great 
amount of work and the limited capacity of the ministry, I would 
not want to concentrate on checking all projects. We want to do 
some positive work." The strategic enterprises--arms industry, 
power generation, etc.--pose a problem because of the need to 
guarantee the strategic intentions of the state. So far, a 
permanent participation of the National Property Fund was 
considered the solution. According to Janicina, however, "the 
strategic interests of the state must be clearly identified, the 
manner of their implementation formulated, and the statutes of 
the specific companies adjusted according to the needs. If that 
is accomplished, the strategic intentions can be realized even 
with a minority participation of the fund, and the majority can 
be offered in coupon privatization." 
  The second installment of the interview opens with a 
question 
concerning Janicina's opinion on employee stockholding 
companies. The minister first notes that the law does not define 
anything like that, then continues to say that he does not claim 
bad intentions in all such companies but that the experience he 
made in this respect is not good. He illustrates this point by 
quoting letters from workers at such enterprises who believe it 
better "to sell the company to foreign capital than to leave it 
to the comrades who are still in the company management." After 
all, "these companies are usually founded with a 50-percent 
stake going to three- or four-member management and 50 percent 
to all other employees." The assessment of the first round of 
privatization identified numerous problems. Nevertheless, 
Janicina says that, "because of the government's limited time in 
office, a change of laws is not feasible. We will influence the 
legislation by government directives." The interview concludes 
with Janicina addressing a major problem of Slovak 
privatization--namely, that "the book value of the enterprises 
is very high, while the market price is relatively low, and the 
price offered by foreign investors is frequently even lower. 
That is the reason standard privatization methods are so slow." 
The difference in prices is dealt with in lengthy talks. 
Janicina says he would be glad "if at least three or four sales 
to foreign investors could be realized before his term in office 
expires." 
  Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY on 29 April carries a TA SR 
report on news conference given by Janicina in Bratislava on 28 
March. Here, Janicina says that he, together with the ministers 
of the founding sectors, is to prepare "the list of the state 
enterprises, the property of which is to be offered in the 
second wave of privatization, by 20 May. The schedule and rules 
for coupon privatization are to be detailed by 10 May." 
Janicina promises to exert every effort so that "the value of 
property offered amounts to at least 80 billion Slovak korunas." 
At the same time, he says, "if I remain minister, under no 
circumstances will I support, and will, in fact, do everything 
in my power against, direct sales to prearranged owners such as 
fellow party members." The ministers states, however, that a 
direct sale to a prearranged owner could still possibly take 
place if "a foreign investor with a good reputation appears on 
the scene with an offer interesting to Slovakia." State 
Secretary Palacka calls the phrase (direct sale to prearranged 
owner) unfortunate and emphasizes that "all projects will be 
published, and counterproposals can always be submitted. One of 
these projects is then selected, so there is always a certain 
amount of competition."

  [Text] Bratislava--The Slovak Government will try to obtain 
a so-called standby loan from the IMF in the amount of $350 
million, even though the restrictive measures in the form of the 
loan conditions will hit the public before the parliamentary 
elections in the fall and will obviously affect the prospects of 
the government parties. This was announced yesterday in 
Bratislava by Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik. The prime minister 
also confirmed that the condition for obtaining the IMF loan is 
to keep the deficit of the state budget under 4 percent of the 
GDP.

<F P=106> [Article by unnamed Bratislava correspondent: "Close of Last </F>
Year Confirms Decline Is Slowing Down"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Some macroeconomic indicators of the 
Slovak Republic [SR] at the close of last year show that the 
dynamic of the economic decline is slowing down. According to 
the monetary analysis of the Slovak National Bank [SNB] with 
preliminary data for December 1993, the GDP, which in the first 
and second quarters of 1993 reduced its lag behind the 
comparable periods in 1992 from 5.5 percent to 5 percent, cut 
this difference in the third quarter to 4.3 percent and in the 
last quarter to 4.1 percent. Of the total yearly inflation of 
25.1 percent, the largest portion--more than 
two-fifths--originated in the first quarter (11.7 percent), 
whereas, in the last three months, only one-eighth did (monthly 
values declined from 1.4 percent to 0.6 percent). 
  Semiannual comparisons of quarterly and monthly values of 
industrial production showed a slowing down of the decline from 
16.6 percent in the first quarter to 13.5 percent in the third 
quarter, and to 12.6 percent in October, 8.8 percent in 
November, and 7.9 percent in December. 
  In the course of the year, unemployment has been increasing 
roughly by 0.5 percent per quarter. The balance of foreign trade 
went from a surplus of hundreds of millions of Slovak korunas 
[Sk] to a deficit of billions, while turnover increased (Sk66.3 
billion in the first quarter, 85.4 billion in the second, 100.7 
billion in the third, and 67.7 billion in October and November). 
  Foreign currency reserves of the banking system doubled to 
$1.4 billion, while the NSB reserves increased from 0.2 to 0.5 
billion. Gross foreign debt kept growing until the third quarter 
(from $2.4 to $3 billion) but has remained steady since then. 
  The deficit of the state budget deepened especially in the 
first quarter (debit balance Sk11 billion) and last month 
(difference of 7 billion), and during 1993 registered a total of 
Sk23 billion. The total debt of the government (excluding 
foreign loans) thus approached Sk60 billion toward the end of 
the year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Minister of Finance Rudolf Filkus by </F>
Oldrich Zabojnik; place and date not given: "R. Filkus: A Third 
Way Not Considered"] 
  [Text] In Moravcik's government, there are a number of 
officials who are not too well known even to the Slovak public. 
That is not true of the Slovak Republic [SR] finance minister, 
the well-known Slovak macroeconomist Rudolf Filkus, who granted 
an interview to the Bratislava correspondent of HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY. 
  [Zabojnik] What will be the basic objective of your work as 
finance minister? 
  [Filkus] We have to make an effort to achieve macroeconomic 
as well as microeconomic stability. We want to continue with the 
steps that have already been taken, and we shall not think any 
more about whether we should use some different third way to 
reach market conditions. We have already gone through the 
liberalization of trade and prices, the internal convertibility 
of the currency, privatization, as well as a tight macroeconomic 
budget and monetary policy. In view of the conditions that are 
thus being created, we shall continue on this road. 
  [Zabojnik] How, specifically, in monetary policy, for 
instance? 
  [Filkus] The minister of finance should not talk about what 
monetary policy should be. That is a matter for the Slovak 
National Bank [NBS], and nobody should interfere in it. It is up 
to the NBS to choose the steps according to its criteria, 
foreign currency reserves, inflation, or the budget deficit. 
Naturally, there can be mutual consultations and joint 
deliberations about what to do next but only to the extent that, 
as the finance minister, I must help find solutions when there 
is a budget deficit to prevent the process of inflation from 
deepening. What I have in mind is the interlinkage of banking, 
monetary, and economic instruments. 
  [Zabojnik] Which part of the SR economy appears to you to be 
the most problematic? 
  [Filkus] The greatest risks exist now in the economic 
microsphere, which does not live off its output but is consuming 
capital. This is directly connected with insolvency, but 
especially with privatization, not only from the standpoint of 
its acceleration but also its depolitization. This important 
instrument of the transformation process has become here an 
instrument for the concentration of political power. 
  [Zabojnik] You were not enthusiastic about the structure of 
this year's SR budget even at the time you were in the 
opposition. How will you specifically apply your views when, as 
finance minister, you are contemplating the amendment of the law 
on the state budget? I would be particularly interested in how 
you intend to handle its expenditure component. 
  [Filkus] Many before us, when they wanted to achieve a 
certain balance in the budget, took the approach of using the 
so-called salami method to keep slicing off expenditures. For 
the minister and his department, it must also be of special 
importance and interest by what channels the revenues should 
flow in, not just keep cutting expenditures. I must therefore 
also be interested in taxes and custom duties, where there is 
enormous unused potential in control. 
  [Zabojnik] You are therefore indirectly in agreement with 
the 
statement of your predecessor, who said that you cannot squeeze 
blood out of a turnip? 
  [Filkus] Well, all right, but today we have a number of 
disadvantaged branches, such as education, health care, and 
culture, and we cannot afford to cut any more from the outlays 
scheduled for them. 
  [Zabojnik] Can this government, considering Slovakia's 
objective possibilities, proceed differently in its relations 
with the Czech Republic than Meciar did? 
  [Filkus] First of all, we have to come to an agreement so 
that we talk about common interests--in the matter of 
certificates, customs union, or clearing blocs. We must meet 
each other halfway. For example, in the case of the customs 
union, we must start with the idea that it is advantageous for 
both, but we must also notice who is at greater disadvantage. As 
far as certificates are concerned, we took the step on our part 
that allows for keeping in force the agreement on mutual 
recognition of Czech and Slovak documents, which will prevent 
the creation of the situation on the border that we had before. 
We also unequivocally agreed that it is necessary to abolish the 
old bloc, which, however, is also up to the parliament.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Trade With Czech Republic; We Import Food </F>
and Export Metallurgical and Engineering Products"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--In the first two months of this year, 
Slovakia achieved a surplus of 830 million korunas [Sk] in trade 
with the Czech Republic [CR]. This transpires from data the 
Slovak Statistical Office published in late April. According to 
this data, the CR remains Slovakia's key trading partner. 
Slovakia exports to the CR 37.6 percent of all of its total 
export volume and obtains from the CR 30.4 percent of its 
imports. Compared with the same period last year, Slovak 
exports to the CR declined 2.2 percent, while imports went up 
14.7 percent. 
  Apart from some food and agricultural products, such as 
cheese, wheat, corn, sweets, chocolate, bakery products, wine, 
and fruit juice, the CR purchases in Slovakia chiefly chemical 
products--mineral oils, gasoline, mineral fertilizers, paints 
and varnishes, herbicides, plastic goods, tires, and hides. 
Products of the consumer goods industry that the CR purchases in 
Slovakia include bathtubs, showers, washbasins, beef hides, 
wooden pallets and wood, combed and carded cotton, and all kinds 
of bottles, flasks, and demijohns. 
  Metallurgical, engineering, and electrical engineering 
products--rolled iron and steel products, wire, generators, 
pumps, excavators, bulldozers, lathes, forming machines, ball 
bearings, and tractors--represent an important part of Slovak 
exports to the CR. Important Slovak export commodities include, 
furthermore, refrigerators and freezers, washing machines, 
television sets, forklift trucks, and transformers. 
  Slovak imports consisted mainly of food--cream, fermented 
milk, yogurt, fats, sugar, salami and sausages, sweets, and 
bakery products. Slovakia imports from the CR, furthermore, 
coal, briquettes and coke, gasoline, mineral oils, 
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, plastic products, rubber, tires, and 
newsprint. Dominant among engineering and metallurgical imports 
are intermediary and rolled iron and steel products, piston 
engines, turbines, pumps, industrial furnaces, and machinery for 
the food industry.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova </F>
by Anna Vargova; place and date not given: "Instead of Oil and 
Gas, They Offer Dollars--But With Some Delay"] 
  [Text] [Vargova] You have just returned from Russia, 
where you discussed the repayment of their debt toward the 
Slovak Republic. In what kind of goods, apart from special 
equipment [euphemism for arms], oil, and gas, are we interested? 
  [Schmognerova] The Russian side actually does not even want 
to discuss the repayment of the debt with oil and gas 
deliveries. It wants to repay the greatest possible part in 
dollars and, thereby, actually defer payments. The other 
possibility is repayment in kind. This applies to some products 
for the defense department, but also other products, a list of 
which we will prepare and send to the Russian Government. Part 
of the debt could also be covered by deliveries for the 
completion of the Mochovce nuclear power station. 
  [Vargova] The third possibility is to swap debt for equity 
[kapitalizacia dluhu]. Has a decision been made about companies 
Slovak capital might have a stake in? 
  [Schmognerova] The next phase of privatization will start in 
Russia on 1 July. This time, it will be privatization through 
auctions, tenders, and sale on the capital market. What 
complicates our position is the steadily declining offer of 
enterprises and the absence of legislation on the Russian side 
that would make it possible for us to enter Russian companies. 
Here, too, we will send them a list of companies, in which the 
Slovaks would be interested. We have agreed on one pilot 
company where this method will be tested. 
  [Vargova] Russia has not yet resolved the financing of the 
Yamal gas pipeline across our territory. I assume that this 
issue was also raised during your talks.... 
  [Schmognerova] We asked Deputy Prime Minister Y. Yarov if 
the Russian Government could speed up the decision on whether 
the gas pipeline will lead across the Slovak Republic as well. 
As soon as this decision is made, we can start talks on ways of 
financing the project. I suppose the Russian Government will be 
interested in taking part in financing the project. We will 
seek foreign investors. 
  [Vargova] Is there a chance of arriving at specific 
agreements by the end of September? 
  [Schmognerova] Definitely. The signing of an agreement on 
the prevention of double taxation and of an intergovernmental 
treaty on cooperation in the sphere of nuclear energy will be 
the first steps. The two countries' experts will work on 
preparing an agreement on the defrayal of Russia's debts toward 
the Slovak Republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Economy Minister Peter Magvasi by </F>
Jana Francikova; place and date not given: "The Slovak Republic 
Is Prepared To Abolish the Surcharge"] 
  [Text] On the occasion of the signing of a supplementary 
protocol to the Central European Free Trade Agreement by the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary [in Budapest on 29 
April], Peter Magvasi, minister of economy of the Slovak 
Republic, declared that "Slovakia has an extraordinary interest 
in the speedy liberalization of trade." HOSPODARSKE NOVINY 
asked him in this context: 
  [Francikova] How does your statement tally with some of the 
nonliberal measures that Slovakia recently introduced against 
the Czech Republic? 
  [Magvasi] As far as the import surcharge is concerned, we 
introduced it because our economic situation at the beginning of 
the year made it necessary. We realize that it is not a liberal 
measure. The development [of the trade balance] has markedly 
improved, however, and, if this trend continues, we are ready to 
abolish the import surcharge by 26 June of this year. At that 
time, we will be conducting talks on it in the GATT Secretariat 
in Brussels. 
  [Francikova] Do you consider fair, in this context, the 
introduction of certificates for imports of food from the Czech 
Republic? Slovak customs officials have been demanding these 
certificates as of 1 May. 
  [Magvasi] I insist that the certificates are not an economic 
measure. We are concerned about the protection of consumers 
and, at the same time, about improving trade between our two 
republics. We did not violate the GATT rules, which demand that 
measures of this kind be announced some time before their 
introduction. We announced our intention at the beginning of 
the year, in the law on the state budget. 
  [Francikova] Is it realistic to expect that a treaty on the 
mutual recognition of certificates between the Czech Republic 
and the Slovak Republic will eventually be signed? 
  [Magvasi] We have succeeded in concluding a treaty on the 
mutual recognition of attestations issued by Czech and Slovak 
testing laboratories. According to the European norm, 
certificates are issued by national bodies of accreditation 
[akreditacni organy]. At the last meeting of the Customs Union 
Council, it was noted that the mutual recognition of 
certificates is conditional on changes to some laws. In a 
situation in which certificates are confirmed by bodies of 
accreditation, it is pointless to change any laws. 
  [Francikova] In other words, you no longer envision the 
signing of a treaty on the complete recognition of certificates. 
  [Magvasi] Time will tell.

  [Text] Tirana, May 4 (ATA) -- On occasion of the 
international day of the press freedom, President of the 
Republic of Albania Sali Berisha pardoned on May 3, four 
journalists sentenced by the court. According to the 
president's spokesman, "in token of honour for the 80 
journalists who were killed all in the name of the free speech 
and the truth all over the world," Mr. Berisha decided to 
abrogate the sentence against journalists Martin Leka and 
Aleksander Frangaj; the probation for Ilirjan Zhupa and the fine 
for Shyqyri Meka. These journalists were sentenced by end of 
February for having revealed state secrets, for slanders and 
violation of the provisions of the Press Law. 
  President Berisha also greeted Albanian journalists on the 
occasion of the international day of the press freedom and 
invited them "to use the free speech to tell the truth and to 
affirm it, to consolidate the values of democracy, to respect 
the people and their dignity and to build a society based on law 
and free initiative."

<F P=106> ["Reopening of the Albanian File Requested -- Letter by </F>
Albanian Intellectuals to the UN secretary general, Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, May 5 (ATA) -- "Albanian intellectuals hold 
that this is a crucial moment for the Albanian national question 
which must mark its return to the agenda of the international 
politics and the treatment of an historical truth with a new 
attention and greater sensibility in relation to the UN Charter 
principles," says a letter that a group of 66 Albanian 
intellectuals among who Adem Demaci, Rexhep Qosja, Ismail 
Kadare, Ali Podrimja, Jussuf Vrioni, Sherif Delvina, Nermini 
Vlora, Zferia Cana, Kristo Frasheri and Inva Mula, addressed 
recently to the UN secretary general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  It is the aspiration of the Albanian people on both sides of 
the border, and also in the interest of all the peoples of the 
region and in the interest of the peace in europe that this ray 
of light, appearing on the horizon of international politics, 
has its impact in the reopening of the Albanian file, the 
Albanian intellectuals say. 
  Their demands are based on the December 1960 resolution of 
the UN General Assembly, which says that "subjugation of peoples 
to a slavery, foreign domination and exploitation is a denial of 
the fundamental human rights, which runs contrary to the UN 
Charter and makes a compromise with the cause of peace and the 
world cooperation." They also cite Article 2 of this resolution 
which says that "all the peoples have the right to determine 
their destiny freely... they freely define their political 
status...." 
  The Kosova question, the intellectuals say, is one of the 
fundamental components of the Yugoslav crisis which is not at 
all "An inner Serbian question" and by all means calls for a 
re-examining and proper solution based on new democratic 
principles. 
  Opposing the thesis that the Albanians of Kosova make up a 
minority in Serbia, the Albanian intellectuals say that the 
Kosova question, taking into account its proportions and 
complexity, makes up a typical case of the colonial regime. 
Unless the hand of the Serbian occupiers is not halted on time, 
the intellectuals warn, they will commit a real holocaust 
against the Albanian population of Kosova. 
  The albanian intellectuals, "Separated by Borders," ask 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali that the question of the future of Kosova 
and of all the Albanians residing in the former republics of the 
disintegrated Yugoslav Federation -- in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], southeastern Serbia 
and Montenegro -- be treated as soon as possible in a special 
international conference under the protection of the universal 
organisation. 
  Imperative for the entire Albanian nation today is the 
recognition of the republic of Kosova as an independent, 
sovereign and neutral state placing it under the observation and 
protection of international bodies the recognition of the right 
of the Albanians of Macedonia, who make up 40 percent of its 
population to be a substantial constitutive component of the 
state recognition and observation of national and human rights 
according to the final act of Helsinki and the Paris Charter to 
the Albanians in Montenegro and southeastern Serbia. On behalf 
of the Albanian people they solemnly pledge that they will 
strictly observe these rights for its ethnic minorities. 
  By ending the appeal, Albanian intellectuals hope that the 
UN 
secretary general will act quickly as is demanded by this 
question which threatens to degenerate into a conflict without 
any outcome.

  [Text] Tirana, May 4 (ATA) -- At the request of the Union 
of the Independent Trade Unions of Albania (UITUA), a meeting 
was held May 3 between the UITUA representatives and the 
government, headed by Premier Aleksander Meksi; the minister of 
labour, emigration and social assistance, Dashamir Shehu; the 
minister of mining and energy resources, Abdyl Xhaja; and other 
government members. The participants in the meeting agreed that 
the issuing of a law or agreement on indexation of inflation be 
sanctioned until the end of May also setting the deadline it 
will come to force. As regards privatization, by the end of 
May, the government promised to issue a decision which will also 
include the demands of the independent trade unions. They also 
agreed that the trade unions be familiarized with the procedures 
of preparing the vouchers and that legislation regarding this 
question be completed within the first six months to be 
submitted to the parliament for approval. 
  Mr. Meksi said that the price rise in the electric energy is 
an indispensability of the reform, but, taking into 
consideration the demands of the Independent Trade Unions for 
compensation for the electric energy, he will once again study 
the financial possibilities especially in the northeastern zone.

  [Text] Sofia, May 5 (BTA) -- The government today asked 
the Constitutional Court to rule on its powers to sanction the 
transit and temporary stay in Bulgaria of equipment of foreign 
states, government spokesman Raycho Raykov told journalists. 
  The issue of foreign troops transit is regulated by the 
Constitution which empowers the National Assembly to take the 
respective decisions. However, the Constitution makes no 
provisions about the transit of foreign military aircraft and 
vessels. This is regulated by the Civil Aviation Act and the 
Sea Space Act authorizing the Council of Ministers. However, 
the government's decision to allow a UN convoy of equipment for 
peacekeepers in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] this April provoked heated debates in 
parliament and the MP's came out with a declaration saying that 
only they could issue such permissions. 
  The Constitutional Court is expected to rule on this issue 
within three months, the government spokesman said. The 
government has assigned experts of the Ministry of the Interior, 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Defence Ministry and of the 
Transport Ministry as well as of the Legal Department of the 
Council of Ministers to draft within two weeks temporary 
regulations for issuing such permissions until the passing of a 
final legislative decision on this issue. There are eight notes 
requesting transit permissions, the government spokesman said.

  [Text] Sofia, May 4 (BTA) -- Today the head of the 
Yugoslav diplomatic mission, Dr. Rados Smilkovic, made a protest 
before Deputy Foreign Minister Dimitur Ikonomov in connection 
with the recent speech delivered by Albanian President Sali 
Berisha at the Bulgarian parliament, the press office of the 
Embassy of Yugoslavia in Sofia announced. Mr. Berisha's speech 
is a violation of the basic rules of diplomacy, Dr. Smilkovic is 
cited as saying. Addressing parliament on April 28 this year 
during his official visit to Bulgaria, Mr. Berisha said that the 
war in Bosnia was a result of the decision of the communist 
dictatorship in Belgrade to establish Greater Serbia by 
aggression.

<F P=106> [Report by Ekaterina Kazasova] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, May 4 (BTA) -- Today's meetings of 
Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who arrived on a 
two-day official visit here yesterday, showed that there are 
good prospects for the development of bilateral relations and 
the promotion of economic cooperation between Bulgaria and 
Indonesia. Today Mr. Alatas was received by President Zhelyu 
Zhelev and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and met with the Deputy 
Chairwoman of the National Assembly Snezhana Botusharova. 
  The lack of controversy between the two countries provides a 
basis for mutually beneficial economic cooperation, it was 
pointed out. President Zhelev asked Mr. Alatas to intercede 
with the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) so that 
the problem of ethnic Turks in Bulgaria be taken off the agenda, 
president's spokesman Valentin Stoyanov said after the meeting. 
President Zhelev explained that the issue had been taken up 
years ago and is no longer topical, as ethnic Turks in Bulgaria 
now enjoy full rights. It is a justified request; the 
memorandum I received from Foreign Minister Daskalov and my own 
impressions convinced me that the Turkish minority issue is no 
longer topical, so I believe the OIC can strike it off the 
agenda, Mr. Alatas told reporters. The issue will probably be 
tabled for discussion at the organization's next session which 
is to be held in Tunisia. The situation in the Balkans and 
particularly the fact that Bulgaria's closeness to the conflict 
in the former Yugoslavia poses risks which hinder foreign 
investment were also discussed by Mr. Alatas and President 
Zhelyu Zhelev. 
  During his meeting with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov Mr. 
Alatas pointed out that Indonesian business circles display keen 
interest in Bulgaria. Several companies have already come here 
to set up joint ventures, the spokesman for the government 
Raycho Raykov said after the meeting. 
  Indonesia's foreign minister discussed the development of 
parliamentary contacts with the Deputy Chairwoman of Bulgaria's 
National Assembly Snezhana Botusharova. They also discussed 
human rights issues and the free expression of the individual. 
Mr. Alatas praised Bulgaria's role as a stabilizing factor in 
the Balkans and pointed out that its economic stabilization will 
further enhance this role. 
  Although my visit here was short, it was extremely 
productive, Mr. Alatas told a news conference before his 
departure. There are no controversies between us; what we have 
to do now is make the bilateral relations more meaningful, he 
added. Our purpose is to open the door to international 
cooperation, said his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov. 
During the meetings Mr. Alatas had with Bulgarian officials it 
was pointed out repeatedly that Bulgaria and Indonesia share a 
similar geopolitical position: They can both be used as 
bridgeheads to other regions. Indonesia could help Bulgaria 
approach the markets in southeastern Asia and Bulgaria could 
help Indonesia into the markets of the former Soviet republics 
and the Balkan countries, the two foreign ministers pointed out. 
"We should not restrict ourselves to bilateral cooperation; we 
should try to capture third markets together," Mr. Alatas said 
in conclusion.

  [Excerpts] Sofia, May 4 (BTA) -- Over 800,000 members of 
5,691 trade union locals nationwide took part in the warning 
strike called by the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions 
in Bulgaria (KNSB) today, KNSB Vice President Zhelyazko Khristov 
told a news briefing. He said that 641,392 people were on 
effective strike, suspending work for an hour. On April 14 KNSB 
staged another nationwide protest, a rally in Sofia. Members of 
the other major trade union, the Podkrepa Labour Confederation, 
as well as of the Association of Independent Trade Unions and 
the National Trade Union also joined in the protest, KNSB leader 
Krustyu Petkov said at a news briefing this morning. The 
leadership of the Podkrepa Labour Confederation supports KNSB's 
demands but advised its members not to take part in the strike. 
None of the political forces generally sympathizes with the 
KNSB, but they have not spoken openly against the 
confederation's demands and the means of protest it has chosen, 
either, Prof. Petkov said in an interview with the PARI daily 
which was published yesterday. Of the parliamentary political 
forces, the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) sticks to a 
position of neutrality, while the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP) supports the strike provided that it is not politicized. 
Several political parties and public organizations voiced 
support for the KNSB. 
  According to Prof. Petkov, the strike has been well 
organized. Teachers, civil servants, employees in transport, 
trade, services and some branches of industry are the most 
widely represented. A one-hour warning strike took place in 
over 4,000 schools, nursery schools and kindergartens with staff 
running up to 190,000, said a representative of the Teachers 
Trade Union with the KNSB. The bridge over the River Danube on 
the Bulgarian-Romanian border was blocked for an hour this 
morning, said Prof. Petkov. Two checkpoints at the border with 
Turkey, Kapitan Andreevo and Svilengrad-Ormenion, also suspended 
operation for an hour. Protest rallies and processions are 
being held. Strikers present their demands in declarations to 
parliament and the government. A rally of doctors and teachers 
in Plovdiv (southern Bulgaria) failed to take place because it 
was banned by city authorities. 
  Today's warning strike is part of the preparations for the 
general strike scheduled to take place on May 17. The KNSB 
insists for incomes compensation. According to Prof. Petkov, 
80 percent of the population is now below the subsistence level 
owing to the steep rise of the U.S. dollar against the lev in 
the recent months, the introduction of VAT [value-added tax] as 
of April 1 and the inertness of the government. The KNSB also 
demands that a government programme for the stabilization of the 
finance market be developed, and that the cabinet take a clear 
stand on the means to defend Bulgarian producers. Another 
demand is transparency as to Bulgaria's commitments to 
international institutions. At a rally in Pernik (western 
Bulgaria) today Prof. Petkov said that the KNSB demands that an 
industry-wide collective agreement be signed for 1994. The 
agreement is ready and only the part concerning wages is yet to 
be agreed, he explained. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday Prime Minister Lyuben Berov notified Prof. Petkov 
that he was ready to start negotiations on May 11 and would 
personally head the government's delegation (as demanded by the 
KNSB). The start of negotiations, however, does not yet mean 
giving up the strike, said Prof. Petkov. As he told PARI, the 
prime minister would go to considerable compromise to get an 
agreement. However, the stands of the prime minister and the 
KNSB as to the protection of the population's savings and of 
local producers are completely opposite, he said. If the 
demands of the KNSB are to be met, that would require actions by 
parliament, too, Prof. Petkov pointed out repeatedly. During 
the period between May 4 and May 17, there will be regional 
protests as well as protests in different branches and 
enterprises, indefinite strikes included. 
  The KNSB press centre reported that the police in Burgas 
(southern Bulgaria, on the Black Sea) and Dupnitsa (western 
Bulgaria, 60 km from Sofia) arrested seven trade union 
activists, including the Confederation's Executive Secretary 
Doncho Donchev. [passage omitted] 
  KNSB leader Krustyu Petkov met with Interior Minister Viktor 
Mikhaylov and the Chief Secretary of the Interior Ministry Kosta 
Bogatsevski. According to Mr. Mikhaylov and Mr. Bogatsevski, 
the trade union leaders had not been arrested. They were only 
taken to the police station for questioning and statements were 
drawn up. Tomorrow morning and the day after tomorrow Prof. 
Petkov and General Kosta Bogatsevski will go to Dupnitsa and 
Nesebur to sort things out on the spot.

  [Text] Prague, May 4 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today 
unanimously approved Bohumira Kopecna in the post of the Czech 
attorney general. Previously -- from January 1, 1994 -- Kopecna 
was charged with temporary heading of the Attorney General's 
Office as deputy attorney general until the appointment of an 
attorney general. 
  Bohumira Kopecna, LLB, was born on July 28, 1946. She 
graduated at the Law School of Prague Charles University and in 
1971 she began to work at the District Prosecutor's Office in 
Bruntal, north Moravia. Later she worked at District 
Prosecutor's Office in Sumperk, north Moravia, and from 1975 she 
was prosecutor in the department of general crime at Municipal 
Prosecutor's Office in Brno, south Moravia. 
  In 1990, Kopecna was appointed deputy prosecutor at 
Brno-Countryside Prosecutor's Office, where she worked until 
April 1993. Then she returned to Brno Prosecutor's Office where 
she worked until December 1993, when the Czech Justice Minister 
Jiri Novak appointed her deputy attorney general. 
  Kopecna has never been member of a political party. "I am 
neither member of any party nor I do intend to join any party, 
but I favor the Civic Democratic Party (ODS). It is true, that 
I voted for them in the last (June 1992) elections," Kopecna 
told CTK on Tuesday. She also said that if she is proposed to 
the post of the attorney general, she would accept, also because 
it was unbearable to exercise simultaneously the functions of 
the attorney general and deputy attorney general. "It is 
necessary to separate these functions," she said.

  [Text] Prague May 4 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
said today that measuring the level of democracy in the Czech 
Republic by the number of non-profit-making organisations had 
been the greatest misunderstanding since the fall of communism 
in November 1989. 
  Speaking with journalists after a government session, he 
said 
that in the article he was preparing for the independent daily 
LIDOVE NOVINY he would engage in a polemic with those "who 
express their aversion of profitability through 
non-profitability." Klaus said that in the title of his 
article, which will read "The More Non-Profit Organisations, the 
More Democracy," he would quote an unnamed author. He dismissed 
speculation that the unnamed author was President Vaclav Havel 
who had often taken up the status and role of non-profit 
organisations. 
  At a press conference on March 26, Havel said that he 
considered non-profit organisations one of the instruments of 
building a civic society. "The social organism must be immune 
to the excessive concentration of political power and it is 
necessary to prevent that any change following elections produce 
a windstorm and that it shake the whole state," Havel said at 
the press conference. 
  Culture Minister Pavel Tigrid said after his meeting with 
Havel yesterday that Havel wanted to discuss the drafting of a 
bill on non-profit organisations in a public television debate. 
Havel has been eagerly pushing for the law, while Klaus and 
some other leading officials have been rather reserved on the 
problem fearing big tax evasions.

  [Text] Prague May 4 (CTK) -- National Property Fund (FNM) 
Chairman Tomas Jezek said on television this evening that far 
from covering up or even initiating swindles in the 
privatisation process, as has been alleged, he and his FNM 
colleagues had actually exposed two big swindles in recent weeks. 
  One concerned the brewery group Prazske pivovary, he said in 
a Nova television interview. The second involved a former FNM 
employee, Milan Krcmar, who Jezek said had manipulated the sale 
of shares in three companies in favour of the Prvni investicni 
investment fund. 
  In a spirited defence against lately mounting criticism, 
Jezek said: "There are politicians who fulfill their role as 
larks -- that means they flit off to international conferences 
and to Davoses and twitter about the successes of our 
transformation; and then someone here who has to do hard work 
everyday, project after project with all the problems, all the 
rascals who want to pinch a bit of state property for 
themselves, who are in far away places I can't get to, can't 
see... and then in the end it all falls on me". 
  Davos, Switzerland, is the venue of a yearly International 
Economic Forum. This year the Czech Republic was represented by 
Premier Vaclav Klaus, Economics Minister Karel Dyba and Trade 
and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy. 
  Jezek said he believed a section of the communist left which 
never wanted transformation and privatisation was responsible 
for the attacks on himself and the FNM's work and were "eagerly 
slinging mud". "That can be exploited by various ambitious 
youngsters, unfortunately from within the coalition, who would 
like to see themselves in my position, at least at the end of 
the successful transformation. They are employed by various 
ministers, some from my party," Jezek said, referring to the 
Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA).

  [Text] Prague May 4 (CTK) -- Representatives of parties 
and movements constituting the Realistic Bloc (RB) agreed on 
Monday [2 May] that the RB would not split, RB Executive Council 
Chairman Vaclav Grulich told journalists today. The RB is formed 
by the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), Liberal Social 
Union (LSU), Christian Social Union (KSU), Greens Party (SZ), 
Zemedelska strana [Agrarian Party] (ZS), Farmers' Movement (HZ) 
and Czech Women's Union (CSZ). 
  During the Monday meeting, the RB Caucus and RB Coordination 
Council agreed that the practise of rotating RB chairman once a 
month hindered serious work, Grulich said, adding that this was 
why a three-strong Executive Council was formed, including 
Grulich (CSSD) as its chairman, Radek Navratil (LSU) and Marta 
Bartonova (CSZ). Two members of the Council will be rotated 
once every six months, Grulich said.

  [Text] Prague May 4 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel 
welcomed today's signing of Palestine self-rule accord and said 
he considered it the beginning of Middle East settlement. He 
told Czech Television that former Czechoslovakia and later on 
the Czech Republic had always supported peaceful and just 
settlement of the situation in the region. This attitude has 
been evidenced by balanced relations with the two parties, Havel 
added. "The Czech Republic is undoubtedly ready to continue its 
assistance, especially regarding the reconstruction of the 
self-rule areas," Havel stressed.

"cooperation with other countries -- be they Visegrad partners 
or elsewhere in the region -- remains a useful preparation for 
the discipline of eventual membership (of the European Union 
[EU])," British Secretary of State Douglas Hurd told CTK today. 
  However, it is "quite possible -- perhaps even likely -- 
that 
different members of the Visegrad Group (the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) will fulfil the political and 
economic conditions for EU membership at different times," Hurd 
said in an interview with CTK before his visit to Prague next 
week. "Appllications from individual Central European countries 
will be judged on their own merits by the member states," he 
added. 
  Hurd said "the main task for the Czech Republic is that of 
adjusting its legislation and administrative rules to European 
standards so that it will be able to play full part in the 
single market." 
  Asked about EU trade restrictions of the imports of the 
goods 
that the Central Europeans produce most efficiently, Hurd stated 
that "politicians must be prepared to act if (Western) markets 
are to be kept open" for the goods from Central and Eastern 
Europe. "That is why the United Kingdom has consistently opposed 
proposals for measures restricting trade to the Czech Republic 
unless they have a clear economic justification," Hurd said. 
  As for the Czech Republic's membership of NATO, about which 
Russia has had reservations, Hurd said it was "important to 
bring home to the Russians that integrating the countries of 
Central Europe into Western institutions will enhance regional 
stability -- which is in the interest of us all." He said he 
welcomed and considered still valid the statement made by 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his visits to Warsaw and 
Prague last August, that "it is the sovereign right of every 
nation to decide to which alliances it belongs." 
  Hurd pointed out that the Czech-British relationship was 
"very close" now, and mentioned the Czech and Slovak servicemen 
who had fallen in defending freedom during the Second World War.

  [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- In order to meet the 
requirements of Hungarian electoral law, the 15 parties which 
qualified to put forth national lists published their electoral 
appeals on Wednesday, March 4, urging every eligible voter to 
turn out for the first round of elections on May 8. The parties 
also called for ensuring fairness in the elections. 
  The statement issued by the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
(MDF), 
the leading party of the current governing coalition, emphasized 
that "The responsibility for Hungary's future is a burden to be 
shared by each of us, now, at the time of the elections, without 
any exceptions. In a democracy, this responsibility is also an 
opportunity for people outside politics to determine their 
country's future policy." 
  "The coming elections are just as decisive in determining 
Hungary's future as were the 1990 general elections, when the 
majority of the population voted the socialist system out, to 
replace it with democracy and national ascendancy," the MDF 
document says. 
  The MDF has asked everybody to notice the early signs of 
economic recovery, even in the midst of everyday worries, and 
cast their ballots in awareness of who are those responsible for 
the country's past, and which party can ensure a peaceful 
future, success and stability for Hungary. 
  Whether there will be any remarkable change in Hungary will 
be the main issue in the elections, the Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ), the biggest opposition party, says in its 
election appeal. The Free Democrats give priority to boosting 
economic growth, promoting prosperity in agriculture, reducing 
unemployment, and guaranteeing social security. "For Hungary, 
neither the road followed in the past four decades, nor the one 
covered in the past four years, is feasible," the SZDSZ states. 
  The opposition Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) statement 
says, "Voters have become disappointed with the present cabinet, 
and obviously want to see a new parliament and a new 
cabinet...What is at stake is no longer a change in regime but a 
change in government. The country wants to have competent and 
honest leaders. This is what the MSZP offers for its voters." 
  The Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP), a member of 
the governing coalition, states, "It is easy to criticize the 
work done by others, but critics forget that the slow pace of 
progress was due not only to the inherited ideological, economic 
and political burdens, but also to persistent rebuke by the 
opposition." The party offers itself for the voters' attention 
as follows, "The Christian Democratic People's Party, which has 
increased its membership tenfold over the past four years, 
remains a consistent force for Christian national ideals." 
  According to the appeal of the opposition Federation of 
Young 
Democrats (Fidesz), Hungarians are dissatisfied with the current 
government. "This government should go! We are aware that 
voters do not wish to continue the long downward march of the 
past four years, involving a decline in production, the 
tightening of belts, and a decrease in consumption and living 
standards. The Young Democrats say: no more of that! A better 
future can begin now, with the next four years," the Fidesz's 
states.

  [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- The Christian Democratic 
People's Party (KDNP) is the only political force in Hungary 
which relies on stable principles and is able to pursue a policy 
which encompasses both commitment to a market economy and social 
sensitivity, KDNP Chairman Laszlo Surjan said at a rally in 
Budapest today, closing his party's electoral campaign. 
  After the parliamentary elections, Hungary should continue 
to 
press on down the path it has followed over the past four years, 
Surjan said. Owing to its policy programme and team of experts, 
the KDNP is capable of giving a positive boost to the current 
government's work, he said, stressing that the present governing 
coalition should be transformed and refreshed rather than 
dismissed. 
  In Surjan's view, conservative Christian Democratic policy 
should play a determining role even in the future, because 
neither the liberal nor the socialist alternative can solve the 
country's current problems.

  [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- According to the 
experience of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), most 
Hungarians believe that the current government proved its 
incompetence over the past four years, and rewarded loyalty 
rather than expertise and skill, MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn told a 
rally in Tatabanya, western Hungary, today. Furthermore, due to 
their decreasing living standards, Hungarians would like May to 
be a month of change, Horn said. 
  Referring to recent harsh attacks on Horn, a journalist 
asked 
the MSZP Chairman whether he was considering giving up his 
political career. Horn replied: 
  "The support and encouragement I receive everywhere in the 
country lends me strength. The idea of giving up my political 
career because of a series of slanders has never occurred to me 
at all. All the more because I know that this is what they 
would like to achieve through these provocations. I do not 
cling on to any office, but over the past four years my primary 
goal was to bring the new, democratic, European left-wing to 
victory in Hungary," Horn said.

  [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- Although the government 
has committed errors over the past four years, Hungary has 
advanced so far that there is no way back to the former 
conditions, Prime Minister Peter Boross, prime minister 
candidate of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the senior 
governing party, told a rally at Pecs tonight. 
  The prime minister pointed out that Hungary, which inherited 
a ruined economy, a disintegrated society and a fallen political 
regime, now has a viable system of democratic institutions, and 
an economy based on private property. Since no party 
cooperating with the trade unions has ever implemented a liberal 
economic programme, there is a suspicion that the Socialists do 
not want to implement it at all. 
  What is at stake in the elections is whether the country 
returns to the failed political regime or prevents the 
interruption of what has started -- even if with errors, 
difficulties and the problems of incompletion. "I trust in the 
instinctive wisdom of the Hungarian nation, which has never 
voted for the left of its own accord -- there had to be an army 
present," the prime minister said.

  [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ) wishes to take part in the next government as 
a strong party, so as to be able to enforce its own programme, 
SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto told a Budapest rally tonight. The 
Free Democrats are not prepared to play "second fiddle" in the 
government. They hope that the new government to be formed 
after the May parliamentary elections will rely more on 
expertise, Peto said. 
  In his view, the governing coalition can be dismissed not 
only by the Socialist Party but also by the liberal bloc 
composed of the SZDSZ, the Federation of Young Democrats, the 
Entrepreneurs' Party, and the Agrarian Association. 
  Campaign manager Balint Magyar said that the election 
campaign is harsher now than it was four years ago. This 
harshness is reflected mainly by certain programmes aired by the 
state radio and television. In reply to a question, Peto said 
that, should the Free Democrats come to power, they would not 
intervene in the internal affairs of the two media. The deputy 
presidents of the state radio and television would be dismissed, 
not for political reasons, but because they have proved 
themselves unfit for managing the public service media in an 
unbiased way.

  [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- "Hungary's ship is heading 
for a safe port, and a good steersman knows everything not only 
about navigation but also of landing," Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Geza Jeszenszky said at an international press 
conference held by the management of the ministry on Wednesday. 
"The anchor is yet to be cast well but the present cabinet has 
already marked out a place for it," Jeszenszky continued, using 
this metaphor to summarize the results of the Hungarian 
Government's foreign policy over the past four years. 
  The minister said this policy has been successful, also 
according to foreign opinions. The government has carried 
through most of what it promised in this field at the time of 
taking office, he said. The cabinet's accomplishment is based 
on ideas and values professed by the bulk of the population. 
This has contributed to establishing the external preconditions 
of internal political and economic development, Jeszenszky said.

  [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- The Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry on Wednesday asked MTI to publish the following 
statement: 
  "The Hungarian Foreign Ministry sees the Palestinian-Israeli 
autonomy agreement, which was signed in Cairo on May 4, 1994, as 
a historic event in the course of Middle East peace 
negotiations. The agreement, which regulates the establishment 
of temporary Palestinian self-government, marks an important 
practical step towards a final settlement. Its implementation 
may bring about a breakthrough in solving the decades-old 
conflict. 
  "We highly appreciate that the PLO leadership and the 
Israeli 
government, laying aside their still-existing conflicts, have 
recognized the necessity of developing mutual understanding and 
finding acceptable formulas for a peaceful settlement. With 
this agreement, they have taken a stand for peace. Their 
position is unambiguous and unchanged: The conflict should be 
settled on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242, 338 
and 425, so that a comprehensive, lasting and just peace can be 
created in the region. This settlement would also imply the 
enforcement of principles based on the agreement of all sides 
concerned and on the realities of the region." 
  To mark the signing of the agreement, Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross has sent telegrams of congratulations to 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, PLO Executive Committee 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, and Egyptian President Husni Mubarak.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 4 -- The Cabinet on Wednesday examined 
the government guidelines of the tasks of the Polish Foreign 
policy in 1994, which will be presented to the Sejm at its 20th 
meeting. 
  One of the priorities of Poland's foreign policy is to 
ensure 
lasting security. To serve this end, Poland will maintain good 
relations with all her neighbours and create conditions for 
unrestrained economic and capital exchange. At the same time 
Poland supports the process of linking the East and West through 
an expansion of the existing security structures, that is the 
European Union, the Western European Union and NATO. 
  In Poland's opinion integration with the European 
communities 
may ensure this country conditions for lasting development. 
Poland will also aim at close cooperation with the U.S. and the 
Far East countries. The priorities also cover conditions to be 
created for free contacts of individuals. 
  The Council of Ministers adopted a resolution on the Polish 
military contingent in the U.N. Disengagement Observance Forces 
(UNDOF) in Syria and amendments to the resolution on the Polish 
military contingent in the U.N. special missions. 
  The ministers resolved to earmark 44 billion zlotys (over 2 
million dollars) for the Ministry of National Defence to 
transform the Polish Medical Company into a logistic battalion 
operating within the U.N. interim force in Lebanon. 
  The Cabinet appointed the minister for foreign economic 
relations chairman of the Polish side in the intergovernmental 
commission and coordinating councils for transborder and 
interegional cooperation. The establishment of bilateral 
commissions and coordinating councils for transborder 
cooperation is envisaged in Poland's agreements with Belarus, 
Latvia, Estonia, Russia, Georgia, and Ukraine. 
  Also on Wednesday, Transport Minister Boguslaw Liberadzki 
briefed the Cabinet about details of the tragic bus accident 
that had occurred near Gdansk on Monday. The minister announced 
a radical acceleration of work on the bill concerning licences 
for professional transport and forwarding agents. 
  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak stressed the urgent need to 
change related regulations to eliminate similar accidents in the 
future, and to modernise the coach and bus stock.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 4 -- Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy 
criticized Solidarity's strivings to gain a dominant position in 
workers' representation during a meeting with the Warsaw-based 
FSO car plant on Wednesday. "I do not accept the union which 
has the overthrowing of the government as its aim," Oleksy said. 
"Solidarity's historical achievements are enormous but the 
proclamation of a general strike is a last resort all over the 
world. I do not think that the situation in the country 
justifies such a need," added the Sejm speaker. 
  According to Oleksy, workers' incomes will be ever more 
differentiated. "The thing is, though, not to forget about an 
elementary sense of social justice. The notion of social 
justice was rejected four years ago. This government is trying 
to implement a different strategy," stated Oleksy. 
  The Sejm speaker also said that four years ago FSO was 
condemned to destruction by some politicians. "Today it is a 
prosperous plant which has prospects for development. This 
proves that it is necessary to create own, Polish solutions 
instead of plagiarizing western solutions, which often do not 
correspond to the Polish reality," concluded the Sejm speaker.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 5 -- President Lech Walesa received on 
Thursday U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown in Warsaw for 
the East-West Economic Forum. 
  Greeting the guest Walesa said that Poland is trying to 
reform its economy. The process is difficult and the road from 
communism to capitalism is long, but there is no danger that 
Poland will veer from this direction. Walesa also said that he 
was counting on the fact that the United States will monitor the 
equality of partners. We do not want any special treatment, we 
want to be treated as partners emphasised Walesa. 
  Brown said that the dialogue between the east and west is of 
key importance to peace and development in the world. The 
United States is very supportive of the changes in Poland, said 
Brown adding that the U.S. and Poland are linked very closely 
and are co-dependent.

  [Text] Washington, May 4 -- Leader of the Social Democracy 
of the Republic of Poland (SDRP) and Chairman of the 
Parliamentary Caucus of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) 
Aleksander Kwasniewski now on a visit to the United States, met 
with Polish and American journalists at the National Press Club 
in Washington on Wednesday. 
  Some twenty journalists, including correspondents of the 
leading U.S. newspapers questioned Kwasniewski about the 
situation in Poland, his attitude to President Lech Walesa, 
Poland's strivings to join NATO and his views on Russia. 
  Kwasniewski declared that Poland is a politically stable 
country of a mature democracy, in which ruling teams change but 
the main elements of implemented reforms remain unchanged. He 
pointed to the development of market economy in Poland and its 
openness to the world. He also stressed that there is a 
consensus among Poland's main parties as to the basic principles 
which should be included in the future constitution. 
  The SLD leader criticized the Solidarity trade union for the 
present strike action. He said that Solidarity is using 
frustration and disappointment for political purposes which can 
be dangerous for Poland. "Solidarity is trying in this way to 
return to the political scene after (...) its defeat in the 
parliamentary elections," he said. 
  Kwasniewski declared that Poland wants to become full member 
of NATO and added that he shares the opinion of Deputy Secretary 
of State Strobe Talbott that the "Partnership for Peace" should 
be the road leading Central European countries to NATO. 
  He stressed that Poland's efforts to join NATO are being 
wrongly interpreted by Russia as an attempt to form a bloc 
directed against that country. "We want to cooperate with 
Russia and we want to have the best possible relations with it," 
he stated. 
  Asked for his opinion about President Lech Walesa, the SLD 
chairman stressed that although there are many differences 
between his party and the president "we share the great 
responsibility for Poland and we have to jointly find some 
compromise." Kwasniewski criticised the president for wasting 
the chance of "strategic changes" instead of concentrating on 
many detailed issues. In his opinion the president in Poland 
should have a position strong enough to be able to act in time 
of crisis. He thought that the American model of presidency is 
not possible in Poland. 
  Kwasniewski is staying in the United States with a 
delegation 
of Polish parliamentarians. On Tuesday, the delegation met with 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, held talks in the 
Congress and met with the Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia. 
On Wednesday, the Polish parliamentarians met with influential 
Democratic Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and on Thursday they 
are to meet with Ambassador Richard Shifter, director for East 
European affairs in the Presidential National Security Council.

Wednesday Chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces, General Anatoliy Lopata, the presidential press office

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 5/5/1994 -- The Romanian 
Communist Party (PCR) is the newest political organization in 
Romania, after its legal recognition Wednesday, 4 May, by the 
Bucharest Municipal Court, third civil section, where it was 
duly registered. This new Communist Party is based in Targu Jiu 
(South-West of Romania) and, according to its president, Victor 
Hancu, 30, an economist by profession, boasts a membership of 
4,000, although for legal registration a political party needs a 
minimum of 263 listed members. 
  Its leaders say that PCR does not intend to continue the 
former Romanian Communist Party, the sole political organization 
admitted to rule the Romanian society for 45 years until 
December 1989. The day's papers remark that the court's 
decision can be contended by any natural or juristic person 
within three days from registration by an appeal to the Supreme 
Court of Justice. 
  Victor Hancu told the press some of his creeds: socialist 
mixed economy based on competition, privatisation of services, 
the state's further ownership of large industrial units, the 
promotion of human values and competence. About Ceausescu he 
said a minute analysis of his activities should be made in order 
to establish his share to the good of Romania. Speaking of 
communist doctrine, Hancu stressed that "it was not the ideas 
that did harm, but people." 
  The first Communist Party was founded in Romania on 8 May 
1921, and claimed to continue the ideas of the Social Democratic 
Party of Romania, founded in 1893. Over 1921-1945 PCR acted 
upon directives from the Communist International, the Comintern, 
and Cominform, along political lines in obvious contradiction 
with reality in Romania. PCR members suspected by the Romanian 
pre-communist security authorities were some imprisoned, some 
under inquest. After World War Two, when Romania was abandoned 
to the Soviet sphere of influence, PCR, re-emerged from long 
years of illegal movement on 23 August 1944, and, although 
counting a few hundred adherents, became the leading political 
force in the state. In the name of socialism, the communists 
perpetrated a long series of abuses against citizen's rights and 
freedoms, which were aimed in fact at destroying the Romanian 
national values and the Romanian state's traditional craving for 
sovereignty. Against such a background, the incipient show of 
independence from Moscow by some Romanian political leaders 
earned PCR the support of an ever greater number of persons, 
some of them recruited from the intellectuals jailed in the 
1950's when Moscow's authority had reached its peak. The 
nationalist tinge of PCR's policy, that met popular support, 
coincided with a period of economic rise and improving living 
standard. 
  The brutal economic recession of the 1980's, the gap between 
aspirations and the incapacity of the system to satisfy them, 
the absence of communication with the masses, the widening abyss 
between rulers and ruled had all led to the mass outburst of 
December 1989, which swept the PCR away from the Romanian 
political scene. In January 1990, under the pressure of crowds 
exulting at the victory of the Romanian revolution, the new 
leadership issued a decree on 12 January disbanding the 
Communist Party, but abolished the decree the following day 
considering it as illegally proclaimed under the pressure of the 
street. Other attempts to re-establish the former Romanian 
Communist Party have been recorded since 1991.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/5/1994 -- Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu sent a message to the leader of the African National 
Congress (ANC) whereby he appreciated the ANC success in the 
first all-race elections in South Africa as "a natural result of 
its (ANC) long-time and consistent efforts as well as to the 
sacrifices assumed by its leaders in order to achieve a 
South-African society beneficial to all its members, 
irrespective of race, religion or political option." 
  "At the same time, we appreciate the ANC victory," reads 
President Iliescu's message "as an expression of the confidence 
of a large share of the population in your political wisdom and 
in the ANC capacity of ensuring together with other political 
parties and forces a transition without violence, well-balanced, 
toward a society based on full equality of rights."

  [Text] Bratislava May 4 (CTK) -- Slovakia's ex-Premier 
Vladimir Meciar said today that "parliament was in the state of 
profound moral and political crisis and it will not probably 
last until the September elections." Addressing some three 
thousands of the supporters of his Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS), Meciar criticised the parliament, the 
government of his successor Jozef Moravcik (Democratic Union of 
Slovakia, DEUS), President Michal Kovac as well as journalists, 
particularly for their allegation that he was expecting a baby 
with the former director of his secretariat, Anna Nagyova. 
  Meciar said he was going to deal with existing problems 
"even 
in the street" because the media were not giving enough space to 
the present opposition. 
  He accused his former party fellow, now Deputy Premier Roman 
Kovac, of embezzling five million dollars, but did not 
elaborate. The affair allegedly marked the beginning of their 
conflicts which resulted in Kovac's departure from the HZDS at 
the beginning of the year. This fact motivated the motion of 
no-confidence in Kovac proposed by the present opposition in 
parliament last week. The motion is to deal with it in the near 
future, but no exact date has been announced yet. 
  Meciar also accused Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the 
coalition Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), of informing 
President Bill Clinton in February 1993 of his intention to 
revive Czechoslovakia. 
  Meciar said this step should be preceded by a merger between 
the KDH and Democratic Left Party (SDL, former communists) and 
the disintegration of the HZDS. The next HZDS meeting is 
planned on June 1. Meciar's supporters want to fill the 
8,000-seat Winter Stadium.

  [Text] Bratislava May 5 (CTK) -- No talks have been held 
about a postponement of the parliamentary elections, nor did the 
Coalition Council discuss the idea, Christian Democratic 
Movement (KDH) Chairman Jan Carnogursky told journalists today. 
  He was reacting to yesterday's remarks made by ex-Premier 
Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the opposition Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), at the HZDS meeting and aimed 
against the present government coalition who, according to 
Meciar, are allegedly trying to render impossible the coming 
early elections to be held in autumn. Carnogursky said other 
remarks by Meciar were "embarrassing and laughable." 
  Meciar said at the meeting that a plot had been hatched by 
Carnogursky and the U.S. President to reunite the Czech Republic 
and Slovakia. 
  Carnogursky said the KDH manifesto was to be based on Slovak 
independence. Even the figures who publicly opposed the 
(January 1, 1993) split and who the KDH would like to see on its 
slate, understand that the split is permanent, he added. 
  "Ex-Premier Meciar should realise that... he has now 
included 
in his lies the President of the United States," Carnogursky 
said, adding that advertising in "one newspaper alone" will cost 
the HZDS 2.5 million crowns (72,500 USD). The KDH has been 
working on a bill to limit parties' election campaign 
expenditures.

  [Text] Bratislava May 4 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament 
passed a motion dismissing all but two of the members of the 
Slovak Television Council today. Supporters of the government 
coalition's bill said the Council had sought to take over the 
running the channel whereas it was meant only to ensure its 
objectivity. The government was also concerned at the Council's 
pro-Meciar bias and preferred all parliamentary parties to be 
represented in it. The opposition decried the bill as an 
infringement of democracy and a purge. 
  The motion was passed only in a repeat vote because in the 
first attempt deputies had left a number of voting papers 
invalid. 
  Today's edition of the trade union daily PRACA commented 
that 
the present coalition would be interested in voting "its people" 
onto the Television Council because transmission times for party 
political broadcasts are at stake before the general elections, 
to be held September 30-October 1.

  [Text] Bratislava May 5 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament 
last night failed to pass an opposition proposal of no 
confidence in Deputy Slovak Premier Roman Kovac, who thus 
remains in his function. Sixty deputies voted for Roman Kovac's 
dismissal, sixty-nine were against and there were two 
abstentions. To dismiss a member of the government requires an 
over-50 percent majority -- at least 76 deputies in the 
150-member parliament. 
  After a day of filibustering by the opposition, late at 
night 
parliament voted on the proposal by 35 opposition deputies led 
by ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar that Kovac be dismissed for 
alleged inability to perform his function, suspicion of 
corruption and moral weakness. 
  The opposition say that Kovac, who used to be deputy premier 
in Meciar's government before he had to leave the party in early 
March, led destructive attacks on the plans of former Health 
Minister Viliam Sobona, and is responsible for the present 
critical situation in the ministry. He promoted the buying of 
health equipment from the German company Siemens to the value of 
74 million marks, and allegedly also disposed of five million 
dollars, from an unspecified foreign source, designated for the 
media. These accusations were not accompanied by concrete 
evidence. 
  "The aim is not my dismissal, but to discredit and besmirch 
my honour, to stop me from being a competitor," Kovac said at 
the end of the debate, and pointed to the opposition's aim of 
proposing the dismissal of one minister at each parliamentary 
session. He emphatically rejected all accusations of corruption. 
  After defeating the proposal for Kovac's dismissal, 
parliament also rejected a proposal for the creation of a 
parliamentary committee, which would investigate accusations 
made concerning Kovac. 
  Yesterday evening parliament dismissed four of the six 
remaining members of the Slovak Television Council, leaving in 
their posts two representatives of the current opposition. It 
immediately elected five members from the government parties to 
the Council and one representative of the Union of Slovak 
Television Artists. One member is still needed to complete the 
council, which now reflects the political balance of power in 
parliament. 
  Other points on the agenda -- the election of a member to 
the 
National Property Fund Board and other members to the Fund's 
Inspection Council, and information about the checking of 
privatisation decisions taken by Meciar's government -- were 
postponed till parliament's next meeting, which will take place 
at the end of May in the new parliament building.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 4 (CTK) -- Slovak Prime Minister 
Jozef Moravcik and other cabinet members will work towards 
speeding up the process of issuing screening certificates, Jan 
Carnogursky said today after a meeting of the coalition council. 
Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement 
(KDH), was reacting to claims that one cabinet member was 
"having difficulties with screening certificates." The 1991 
Czechoslovak screening (or "lustration") law debars former 
Communist Party officials, agents of the StB secret police and 
People's Militia members from high political and economic posts 
until 1996. 
  Carnogursky said the government did not intend to change the 
screening law, adding that the government would deal with the 
question of the alleged positive screening of one of its members 
very soon. "The screening certificates of all members of the 
government will be available within the next two weeks," said 
Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of parliament and chairman of 
the National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA). He 
stated that new screening certificates, issued by the Slovak 
Information Service so as to be incontestable, were required for 
all cabinet members. 
  Carnogursky said he did not know which cabinet member was 
said to be having problems with screening. He said the 
coalition council had set up a working group that would make 
recommendations on how the screening law would be implemented in 
Slovakia. Both Carnogursky and Cernak confirmed today that 
their candidates for the autumn parliamentary elections would 
have cleared the screening process.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 4 (CTK) -- "When President Kovac 
asked me to take up my duties, I assumed that all the matters 
concerning my appointment to the post of minister had been 
cleared," Economy Minister Peter Magvasi commented today on the 
speculation that he is the member of the government with 
positive screening certificate. All the senior officials are 
required to have a clean record regarding cooperation with the 
communist secret police (StB). 
  "I am clean before myself," Magvasi told CTK, when asked 
about this. Asked whether the accusation stems from forces 
trying to "sidetrack" the SDL in Moravcik's cabinet, Magvasi 
replied: "Maybe." 
  Magvasi said it was not accidental that his past is being 
questioned shortly after he "pointed to the schedule of the 
coupon privatization in Slovakia." He added that he did not 
question this privatization technique, but he just intended 
"that the citizen is not 'cheated' by the hectic and 
unprofessional pace." 
  Premier Jozef Moravcik admitted there was tension between 
Magvasi (Democratic Left Party, SDL) and Privatization Minister 
Milan Janicina (National Democratic Party-New Alternative). 
Magvasi favors standard privatization techniques, while 
Janicina is considered to be an advocate of the former method. 
  The first wave of privatization ended in January 1993. 
Ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's government did not favor 
this method of privatization. The new government of Jozef 
Moravcik has said the second wave could be launched in the 
autumn.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 4 (CTK) -- The broad cooperation of 
the right-wing and center parties, as suggested by the Christian 
Democrats, could lead to "revival of the creatures from Jurassic 
Park" which do not belong to the Slovak politics any more, 
Deputy Chairman of the NDS-NA Anton Hrnko told journalists 
today. The NDS-NA (National Democratic Party-New Alternative), 
led by Ludovit Cernak, splintered from the Slovak National Party 
(SNS) in February. The NDS-NA has 5 deputies in the 150-member 
Slovak Parliament. 
  "I am speaking about people who are not able to put up with 
the current political situation and who still long for the old 
federation (former Czechoslovakia)," Hrnko said. This could 
eventually damage the Slovak right, he added. 
  On Saturday [30 April] the Christian Democratic Movement 
(KDH) put in an offer to its potential partners regarding "the 
open list of candidates up from a certain number." In addition 
to the NDS-NA, the offer relates to the Democratic Party and the 
Standing Conference of the Civic Institute. 
  A coalition after the election (scheduled for September 
30-October 1) with the left-leaning parties could be considered 
only "on the principles of national interest," Hrnko said, 
adding that his party was ruling out cooperation with the 
"authoritarian" parties, based on "principle of the personality 
cult," i.e. with Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) and Jan Slota's SNS.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 4 (CTK) -- Gaining German support 
for the respect of Slovak interests in the European stability 
pact, now under preparation, belongs to the goals of a two-day 
visit of Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan to Bonn and 
Berlin, which started today. 
  Before leaving Bratislava, Kukan told CTK and Slovak news 
agency (TA SR) that he would meet with his German counterpart 
Klaus Kinkel to discuss German support for Slovakia's efforts to 
join an integrated Europe, and German investments in the 
connection with the plans of the new Slovak Government to speed 
up the privatization process. 
  Kukan said he also wanted to take up the question of 
compensation for the Slovak victims of the Nazi regime. 
However, he said he did not expect any definitive solution. 
For the time being, Bratislava neither intends to open the 
question of negotiating a new international agreement with 
Germany, concluded under the Czechoslovak federation. 
  Kukan is also to meet with German Defense Minister Volker 
Ruhe, mainly to discuss Slovakia's participation in the 
Partnership for Peace plan, and its ambition to join NATO. On 
Thursday [5 May], Kukan is to lecture on Slovak foreign policy 
in the European Academy in Berlin. 
  "Slovakia is interested in participation in the stability 
pact (based on a plan of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, 
approved by the EU, and aimed mainly at preventive settlement of 
the problems concerning borders and ethnic minorities in former 
communist countries), but is even more interested in the pact's 
respecting Slovak interests. As they are not sufficiently 
expressed in the pact's draft wording, I will ask minister 
Kinkel for his support," Kukan said. 
  Slovakia refuses the proposal to negotiate its international 
agreement with Hungary under EU auspice. However, the 
possibility of Slovakia's not joining the pact has not been 
considered. "We believe.. the pact will be acceptable for 
Slovakia as well," Kukan said. 
  Until the recent improvement of mutual relations, Bratislava 
disputed with Budapest over the status and the rights of the 
500,000 ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia. While Budapest is 
pushing for collective rights for the Hungarian minority, which 
it has made the condition for the conclusion of a 
Slovak-Hungarian treaty, Bratislava rejects this idea and is 
promoting individual rights for minorities' members, in line 
with European standards. Slovakia has been simultaneously 
urging Hungary to guarantee the inviolability of the present 
Slovak-Hungarian borders. 
  "We are interested in our relations with some countries of 
the region being settled bilaterally, without sponsorship and 
the oversight of somebody else," Kukan said. "We are able to 
negotiate important agreements ourselves and are willing to 
offer these agreements as our contribution to the stability 
pact, as well as to establish certain mechanisms to control the 
observance of the pact's provisions. We do not want our stands 
to be pressed upon us from outside," he stressed. 
  Kukan confirmed that his meeting with his Czech counterpart 
Josef Zieleniec is being prepared, but a suitable date has not 
been found yet.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur </F>
Yordanov by Valeriya Veleva; place and date not given: "No 
Translator Was Needed When I Talked to Gligorov"] 
  [Veleva] Mr. Yordanov, in his speech to the Bulgarian 
parliament Albanian President Sali Berisha called Serbia a 
source of "war, conflicts, instability, and aggression" in the 
Balkans. How would this be accepted in diplomatic circles? 
  [Yordanov] I am sure Mr. Berisha's speech will be read 
carefully both in Athens and Belgrade. This is normal. 
Regardless of how his speech is accepted in various countries, 
one cannot deny the sincerity and openness of his position. I 
have a high regard for the speech, because it named clearly, and 
I would say in a nondiplomatic manner, some of the greatest 
dangers in our region. By this I mean the communist heritage, 
imperial ambitions, and radical nationalism. These are Balkan 
illnesses. It is much easier to heal an illness when you have 
diagnosed it. In this sense Berisha, who is a noted politician 
who has made a great contribution to the democratic reforms in 
Albania, met with understanding in the National Assembly. 
  [Veleva] Do you share Berisha's position on the situation in 
the Balkans and the danger of the Yugo-conflict expanding to the 
south? 
  [Yordanov] I have always stressed that the war in former 
Yugoslavia is a result of several factors: traditional 
nationalism, xenophobia, and ethnic intolerance -- a sinister 
remnant from the past which was activated very much in the 
postcommunist situation. We should also not forget the very 
legacy of the communist way of thinking that remains in many 
people and politicians. In addition, democratic changes are 
taking place very slowly in former Yugoslavia, where communist 
structures and the former communist leaders continue to 
dominate. This by itself represents a danger. One should not 
forget who first started the war. It is a result of the Serbian 
striving to expand their territory. Sometimes people in 
Bulgaria forget this historical fact, which must be remembered. 
  I expect that in the near future formulas for resolving the 
Balkan crisis will be found and Bulgaria will be the state that 
will best defend the European principles and values. The more 
quickly we integrate our country in the European economic and 
parliamentary structures and the closer our relations with NATO 
become, the more Bulgaria will be a peaceful, secure, stable, 
and prosperous state. This will be its contribution to the 
all-European process. 
  [Veleva] Do you think that events around 17 May, when the 
Turkish "Blue Helmets" head for Bosnia-Herzegovina, will again 
stir the Bulgarian parliament? 
  [Yordanov] I do not divide the Blue Helmets up into Turkish, 
American, Russian, and Finnish. A soldier with a blue helmet is 
a symbol of peace and understanding. However, we have 
repeatedly warned that the presence of precisely Turkish Blue 
Helmets could have a destructive role in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
where nationalism is very strong. Whoever speaks against Turkey 
serves a non-Bulgarian and non-European policy. However, since 
the conflict in Yugoslavia was created on the basis of the 
continuing nationalism, there is the danger that the appearances 
of precisely Turkish soldiers with blue helmets could activate 
nationalism and prompt historical associations. In this context 
during the visit of Mr. Cindoruk I repeatedly stressed that from 
the point of view of the existing complexes related to the 
Balkan nations' nationalism, the presence of Turkish blue 
helmets in the conflict region is undesirable. However, let us 
not forget that they were called to Bosnia- Herzegovina not by 
the Turkish Government, but by the United Nations. 
Subsequently, our position is that the United Nations should 
take closer note of historical and specific realities when it 
sends troops from a certain country. 
  [Veleva] Mr. Yordanov, do you not have the feeling that we 
are being slowly dragged into the conflict? 
  [Yordanov] I would not say that. The European and world 
communities are simply looking for ways to resolve the conflict. 
If we begin to think that the world wants to create a war in 
the Balkans, it would encourage an exceptionally populist and 
provincial attitude in our country. This is a provincial policy 
that could be discussed in street taverns. However, this is not 
the way one should be thinking at the end of the 20th century. 
If it is true that the world is so evil that it wants to kindle 
new conflicts, and that the major statesmen are such monsters, 
then there is no hope for the world! How could we oppose this? 
Obviously, we must believe, and I absolutely do believe, that 
the efforts of the United Nations, the EC, the United States, 
Russia, and all Balkan countries must be directed precisely 
toward resolving the conflict. Real steps have already been 
adopted to try to stop the conflict, and there have been real 
achievements. 
  [Veleva] Did Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] not strain our relations with Greece? What 
can we expect from the upcoming visit of the leader of "New 
Democracy" to our country? 
  [Yordanov] I do not think so. Greece's policy is clearly 
oriented toward Europe. The Greeks have reason to express 
certain concerns. Some articles of the Macedonian Constitution 
really do not correspond to the principles that are 
characteristic of the member-states of the Council of Europe. 
There are no outstanding problems between Bulgaria and Greece, 
and it is impossible for our relations to be strained. These 
relations are founded on principles that have a noble place in 
our historical memories. It is a fact that we view Greece as a 
country through which we really could come closer to the 
European structures. 
  [Veleva] Upon his return to Macedonia Kiro Gligorov said 
that Bulgaria must walk its share of the road toward recognizing 
the so-called "Macedonian" language, in which the Macedonian 
literature supposedly is written. Do you think that the future 
will see a "Macedonian" nation and language? 
  [Yordanov] I cannot make any forecasts, but when I talked 
with Gligorov there was no need for a translator. In fact, the 
translator only created a noise. I think Gligorov understood 
absolutely everything I said without any translation. As far as 
the "Macedonian" language is concerned, I have examined this 
issue and studied the activity of the Miladinov brothers [noted 
Bulgarian culture and history researches in the first half of 
the 19th century], and share the opinion of Bulgarian science. 
Therefore I categorically supported the position that the 
expression "in the official languages of the two countries" 
should be included in the documents that were supposed to be 
signed. Since the official languages are determined by the 
appropriate articles of the Constitutions, there were no 
obstacles to signing important documents, except emotional 
reasons of a domestic political nature. I am convinced that 
sooner or later these language and emotional problems related to 
the interpretation if history will be eliminated, because they 
do not have an important part in feeding the people! Interests 
of economic, trade, and purely humane character will become ever 
more important. The border that exists between Bulgaria and 
Macedonia will separate us less and less, and unite us more and 
more. When this border becomes a border of rapprochement, it 
will suddenly become clear that we speak the same language.

Krustyu Petkov made today at a news conference of the KNSB 
[Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria] in which 
he claimed that the telephones of the trade unions that are

tapped. The statement denies the KNSB claim. In its own 
announcement, the Interior Ministry Press Center points out such 
actions are not allowed, as they would violate the Law on

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Varshava Maksimova] </F>
  [Text] According to information received from the National 
Strike Committee of the KNSB [Confederation of Independent Trade 
Unions in Bulgaria], 844,599 people took part in today's 
national warning strike, while 641,392 people took one-hour 
effective strike action. Protest rallies were held at more than 
half the enterprises in the country. Members of the Podkrepa 
Labor Confederation, the Association of Democratic Trade Unions, 
and the National Trade Union, as well as private drivers, also 
took part in the protests. 
  In Plovdiv the city authorities banned the planned rally, as 
a result of which health workers took part in a silent march 
along several of the city's central streets. Over 30 
organizations in the road transportation sector took part in the 
strike, stopping work for periods varying from 15 to 60 minutes. 
  The following main roads were blocked for one hour: the 
Sofia-Svilengrad road near Khaskovo; the Burgas-Sofia road at 
Aytos; the Sofia-Kulata route at Dupnitsa; the Ruse-Silistra 
road near Slivo Pole. The Varna-Burgas road was blocked for 20 
minutes near the village of Kosharitsa. In Svishtov dockers 
blocked the river port for one hour, while the Danube Bridge was 
closed in both directions for one hour. 
  According to the KNSB National Strike Committee, the police 
arrested four trade union leaders today when they attempted to 
block the Burgas-Varna main road. Those detained included KNSB 
Executive Secretary Doncho Donchev. Three trade union leaders 
from Dupnitsa were also arrested. The National Strike Committee 
delivered a sharp protest against these police actions and 
stated in an official announcement that this step might lead to 
a new escalation of the strike conflict. The KNSB will 
immediately inform the European Trade Union Confederation, the 
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the 
Council of Europe of these violations of the Social Charter and 
European conventions. The same institutions will also receive 
reports on the action taken to prevent workers from two 
commercial enterprises holding a rally in front of the Council 
of Ministers building in Sofia. 
  In connection with these statements issued by the KNSB 
National Strike Committee, the Interior Ministry Press Center 
disseminated an announcement that rejects these claims outright. 
According to the Interior Ministry announcement, the attempts 
to block the road in the region of Slunchev Bryag and the main 
road near Dupnitsa represented offenses against the Road Traffic 
Act, as a result of which the police filed charges against the 
drivers involved. The statement notes that no force or special 
equipment was used. Regarding the rally outside the Council of 
Ministers building, the announcement states that the 
participants were informed by law- enforcement agences that no 
permit for the rally had been issued, following which they 
quietly dispersed without any incident. 
  After teachers and kindergarten assistants in boarding 
schools and children's and orphans homes had stopped work for 
one hour, at 1600 today the National Strike Committee of the 
Bulgarian Teachers Union signed a strike agreement with the 
Ministry of Education and Science that partially satisfies the 
teachers' demands.

  [Text] It is now the third day since the companies engaged 
in the division of farmland suspended work on restoring the land 
to its owners. They will continue their action until the 
Agriculture and Finance Ministries, the government, and 
parliament examine their problems and make official decisions on 
them. Today representatives from companies all over the country 
held a protest march. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The march began with a rally 
held in front of the Agriculture Ministry. The protesters 
believe that our country lacks the political will to resolve the 
problems of the land reform. For almost one month, their 
attempts to hold negotiations with the institutions responsible 
have been postponed with the excuse that the prime minister was 
ill and ministers were abroad. 
  [Unidentified protester] Our first demand is that the 
contracts should be fulfilled and payments made on time, so that 
the small companies can cover their costs. Second, we demand 
that the contract prices should be indexed; they have not been 
indexed in line with inflation since 1992 so, owing to rising 
inflation, it is impossible to meet the costs of the land 
reform. The firms involved in land division do not oppose 
value-added tax, because they know that this is the best way to 
provide revenue for the budget, but they want the Agriculture 
Ministry to pay the money that is due to the taxation 
authorities, as the law provides. 
  [Correspondent] After Agriculture Minister Georgi Tanev 
refused to receive the protesters, they set off to the Council 
of Ministers and National Assembly, where they handed over their 
declarations.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Deputy Prime Minister Valentin </F>
Karabashev by Venelina Gocheva and Khristofor Karadzhov; place 
and date not given: "Berov Stopped Privatization"] 
  [Excerpts] [24 CHASA] Mr. Karabashev, you decided to act 
ahead of the prime minister and resigned before he kicked you 
out. 
  [Karabashev] I think that such a move is normal. Since the 
prime minister stated in front of the National Assembly and the 
people that he was dissatisfied with my work as minister of 
trade and deputy prime minister, he should have replaced me 
already on 27 April. It was abnormal not to do it. Since I 
adhere to normal things, I resigned. 
  I intended to do it already last week because of differences 
with the prime minister, including on the issue of reshuffling 
the cabinet. However, I decided to wait a bit longer, because I 
hoped to reach a compromise. 
  [24 CHASA] What was it that you did not like in the proposed 
reshuffling? 
  [Karabashev] Initially, I was offered the posts of deputy 
prime minister or a minister without portfolio, without 
precisely determined functions. From the conversation with 
Professor Berov I did not understand what precisely I would be 
responsible for. Mainly from other people I also understood that 
he himself did not know this. Apparently, it was not the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] that changed its attitude toward 
me, but rather that he simply did not have an alternative 
candidate for my post. [passage omitted] 
  [24 CHASA] Was not the fact that Mr. Matinchev was appointed 
acting prime minister the reason for the cooling of your 
relations with the prime minister? 
  [Karabashev] This act indicated a certain lack of confidence 
in me, and in the final analysis this was confirmed by the 
proposals for reshuffling the cabinet. 
  [24 CHASA] All right, what are the differences between you 
and the prime minister? 
  [Karabashev] We differ on the Law on Privatization and the 
privatization process itself. There also were serious 
differences during the preparation and the adoption of the 
regulations on the state participation in the privatization and 
the related functions of the Privatization Agency. If you 
recall, there were great differences during the preparation of 
the documents related to establishing the Interdepartmental 
Council on the Military- Industrial Complex. The 
supradepartmental organ that was proposed then contradicted the 
constitution. In the final analysis, the proposal was rejected 
after I and Minister Bikov objected. You could also recall the 
disputes regarding the adoption of the so-called privatization 
list for 1994, which although it had no legal value, inflicted a 
severe blow on the privatization process. 
  Contrary to Prof. Berov, who said in the parliament that I 
am 
the reason for the fact that there is no privatization, I 
maintain that he is the cause. This is related to his desire to 
replace the market privatization by a mass privatization already 
during the first days of his tenure. [passage omitted] 
  [24 CHASA] With your resignation from the parliament [as 
published] the Alternative Social Liberal Party [ASP] ceases to 
be a ruling party. 
  [Karabashev] It was not a ruling party anyway, because my 
influence in the cabinet was rather weak. 
  [24 CHASA] Do you know what President Zhelev thinks about 
your resignation? 
  [Karabashev] I talked to President Zhelev prior to my 
resignation.... 
  [24 CHASA] Did he try to dissuade you? 
  [Karabashev] No.

  [Text] I am very pleased to have the opportunity to visit 
Bulgaria, something that I have wanted to do for a long time, 
said Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Abdullah Alatas upon his 
arrival. During his meetings in Sofia he will mainly discuss 
issues connected with developing economic contacts, because no 
controversial problems exist in political relations between 
Bulgaria and Indonesia.

  [Text] On 4 May President Zhelyu Zhelev received 
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas,, who is on an official 
visit to Bulgaria. Presidential Spokesman Valentin Stoyanov 
reports on the main topics discussed during the talk: 
  [Begin Stoyanov recording] There are no political 
differences between the two countries. This is a prerequisite 
for intensifying relations between the two countries, especially 
in the trade and economic sphere. We hope that this will be 
achieved. 
  President Zhelev asked Alatas to influence the Islamic 
Conference Organization to drop the Bulgarian Turks issue from 
its agenda. This issue has been on the organization's agenda 
for several years already. This is a a total anachronism, 
because the rights of the Bulgarian Turks have been fully 
restored. They are among the members of the parliament and in 
the organs of the municipal power, and it appears that the whole 
issue is now obsolete. 
  Alatas promised to raise the issue during the organization's 
next session in Tunisia, because, according to him, the 
organization has other more important issues that it must 
resolve. [end recording]

specific changes in both our countries, Indonesian Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas said at a news conference today prior to his 
departure. He pointed out that in addition to developing trade 
and economic relations, the two countries must seek together 
third markets in their regions, the Balkans and the Far East. 
  Regarding the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the guest said 
that the ethnic basis of the conflict must not be ignored and 
that Indonesia supports dividing Bosnia-Herzegovina into three 
ethnic parts -- provided it is done in a just way and in 
accordance with the country's independence.

    [Editorial Report] Commentaries appearing in mid-April on 
the editorial pages of three Budapest journals with different 
political orientations all indicated that the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP), successor to the former ruling Communist 
Party's reformist wing, is likely to win the parliamentary 
election in the two rounds of voting on 8 and 29 May. The 
consensus is apparently so widespread that even a supporter of 
the present right-of-center coalition, PESTI HIRLAP, in a 14 
April commentary by Ferenc Sinkovics, admitted that "every day 
it becomes unequivocally clearer: The MSZP will win the 
election." Most of Sinkovics's commentary was devoted to 
predicting the problems an MSZP government would face. Noting 
that the communist system collapsed irrevocably and cannot be 
reinstated, especially since there is no longer any "Big 
Brother" behind it, Sinkovics asserted that the MSZP will be 
"forced to accept building a market economy" and will lose 
support when it becomes clear that it is no more successful than 
the present government in lowering prices--which, to Hungarian 
voters, "is more important than any principle or ideology." 
Noting that Hungary may follow the example of Poland, where 
society became "disappointed and impatient" with the leftist 
government "in a few months" when it failed to improve the 
economy, Sinkovics noted that "we cannot be sure that the 
socialist government will last" until the next scheduled 
election in 1998. 
  Although more ambiguous than the PESTI HIRLAP piece, an 
editorial commentary by Istvan Csurka--who was expelled last 
fall for his far right views from the more centrist Hungarian 
Democratic Forum (MDF), the leading party of the present 
government--also indicated that the MSZP is likely to win the 
election. In an editorial published on 21 April in his weekly 
MAGYAR FORUM, Csurka chastized the MDF for its "arrogant 
refusal" to accept the proposal of his party, the Hungarian 
Justice and Life Party (MIEP), that they and the other 
"national" parties--the Christian Democratic People's Party and 
the Independent Smallholders Party--form a coalition against the 
left. Unless the moderate right and far right agree to 
cooperate, Csurka asserted, the MSZP will be in a position to 
"choose its own coalition," most likely forming a government 
with the main liberal party, the Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ). The only outcome that would be "even worse" than an 
MSZP-SZDSZ government would be a coalition of the MDF, the 
Christian Democrats, the Smallholders and the liberals, in which 
the "national forces" would be a mere "meaningless decoration," 
Csurka wrote. The MIEP would not join such a coalition under 
any circumstances, Csurka declared. 
  Arguing that the election must not be allowed to become a 
"duel" between the right and left, Ferenc Pallagi in the 14 
April issue of the trade union daily NEPSZAVA urged liberals to 
unite and present a viable alternative both to the present 
right-of-center government and to the socialists, "whose 
popularity has grown incredibly in recent months." If the two 
main liberal parties -- SZDSZ and the Federation of Young 
Democrats (Fidesz) -- do not cooperate more effectively, Pallagi 
said, the "liberal center" will "disappear," leaving only the 
left and right. Of these, the left has the "bigger possibility" 
of winning, for there is "little chance" that voters will 
support the parties of the present government, of which the 
public is "visibly more afraid," Pallagi argued, "than of the 
reddest left." Thus, he suggested, unless the liberals regain 
momentum, the left will get a commanding lead in the election. 
"And, having won by too much, the Socialist Party will have a 
hard time trying to form a government," Pallagi said, because no 
prospective coalition partner will want to lend its "name and 
political prestige" to a government that "it will hardly be able 
to influence." It is possible, however, that the left's victory 
will be so great that it will be able to govern alone, "without 
any control"--a prospect, according to Pallagi, that may be 
"just as repellent" as the "right-wing rule" of the present 
government.

<F P=106> ["Memorandum Addressed to the Council of Europe by the City </F>
of Timisoara"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] On occasion of the Easter Holiday, the former 
sovereign of Romania, King Mihai I, was invited to Timisoara by 
his holiness the metropolitan of Banat, the Timisoara 
Municipality Council, and by the mayor of the city. The 
invitation was based on the fact that King Mihai is the founder 
of the Timisoara metropolitan cathedral. 
  For the third time, the Romanian Government denied King 
Mihai 
the right to visit Timisoara, this time invoking false security 
problems. We wish to notify international public opinion that: 
  1. Mihai of Romania is a Romanian citizen who was born in 
Romania, his parents being Romanian citizens. According to 
Romania's current Constitution and the stipulations of the 
Universal Declaration on Human Rights, that gesture of the 
government is an abuse. 
  2. Considering that not a single foreign citizen has been 
subject to circulation restrictions on the territory of Romania, 
the imposing of such restrictions upon a Romanian citizen is an 
arbitrary and discriminatory act. 
  3. The stance adopted by the Romanian Government offends our 
dignity as citizens of the city of Timisoara, by the sacrifice 
of which in Romania, in December 1989, the way was opened for 
liberty and democracy. At the same time, such practice 
maintains a state of tension in the country and creates 
suspicion that may divide Romanian society and prevent national 
reconciliation. 
  We request that the Council of Europe should discuss in its 
special commissions, as well as in its plenary session, the 
abuse signaled by us. The attention granted by the Council of 
Europe to the present memorandum would represent moral 
reparation for us.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Janos Gyarmath under the "We Cannot Leave This </F>
Without Commentary" rubric: "Transylvanian Offensive"] 
  [Text] The ambitious Adrian Nastase and the governing party 
thinks that the time has come to obliterate, or attempt to 
obliterate, the weak election results of the Social Democracy 
Party (of Romania) [RSZDP] in Transylvania. As we recall, in 
spite of all his efforts, Ion Iliescu and his troupe did not 
succeed at the time in "building a nest" in Transylvania, in the 
municipalities of which the votes were acquired by the two 
opposing regional parties, the Romanian National Unity Party 
[RNEP] and the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania 
[RMDSZ], as well as by the Democratic Convention of Romania 
[RDK] which was supported by the latter. This fact might lead 
one to conclude that the election program of the SZDP did not 
capture the sympathy of Transylvanians, for two simple reasons. 
On the one hand, its economic policy did not promise the changes 
for the towns and villages which Transylvanians expected after 
the change of regime in 1989, and on the other hand, the 
national strategy proved to be opportunist, because it did not 
satisfy extremist Romanian movements, the Romanian Hearth [Vatra 
Romaneasca], but neither did it present a modern program, 
befitting the spirit of Europe, which could have appealed to the 
moderate elements, or to the Hungarians. Thus, in the tense 
atmosphere following the events of Marosvasarhely [Tirgu Mures], 
essentially with the powerful help of the governing party, 
nationalism and xenophobia gained ground in Transylvania, 
accompanied by the rise of the RNEP and "Funarism." At the same 
time, all the people who were disappointed in the Front(s) 
showed their support for the RDK, so that the Hungarians, who 
became relatively isolated, would unequivocally vote for the 
RMDSZ. 
  One cannot grasp exactly what is more annoying for the SZDP, 
which has a virtual monopoly in the other historical provinces 
and especially in the countryside--whether that the RNEP lured a 
great number of Romanians from it or rather that by now, in 
three rounds of voting, the Hungarians ended up on the other 
side, on that of the RDK? Perhaps both. Of course not to the 
same degree. Whereas the SZDP has been cooperating, at least in 
Parliament, with the RNEP for two years, in spite of all 
irritations and partnerial unruliness, the RDK and the RMDSZ, 
which delivers votes to it, are indisputably on the other side, 
that is to say, in the opposition. 
  However, it seems that the balance of power is shifting in 
Transylvania. It seems that because of its extremist and 
demagogue program, because of Mayor Funar's unruliness and its 
ties to Caritas, the RNEP is losing speed and at the same time 
ground. But in whose favor? Not necessarily in favor of the 
governing party, with which not only the Hungarians but also the 
Romanian population of the province are more and more 
dissatisfied. Thus, an early election would favor the RDK, the 
parties of which could lately be labeled less and less "henchmen 
of the Hungarians" because they hardly ever stand up to 
accusations against the RMDSZ, or for the party's legitimate 
demands.... 
  In other words, one must make a move, Adrian Nastase 
decided. 
And he made a move. Moreover, he did so on Saturday, in Cluj, in 
the "nest" of the RNEP, where he convened a regional meeting and 
sketched the direction and strategy of his Transylvanian 
offensive before 16 SZDP chairmen and prefects from Transylvania 
and Bansag. This signals that on the one hand, the governing 
party would like to fill the void left by the decline of the 
RNEP, and on the other hand, somehow curtail the RMDSZ, namely 
by "alienating" several organizations of Hungarians from it. In 
other words, if up to now his purpose was to drive a wedge 
between the RDK and the RMDSZ, to isolate the latter, and to 
strip it from its allies, then from now on he wants more. With a 
somewhat modified national policy, he wants to decrease the 
political influence of the organizations that safeguard the 
interests of Hungarians and to demonstrate that the majority of 
the Hungarian population does not follow the "extremists" of the 
RMDSZ and does not want any kind of autonomy; that is, having 
lost its patience and having resigned itself to everyday 
problems, it would be satisfied with much less. This is the 
source of the praise for the RMDSZ but also of the serious 
accusations that it conducts ambiguous politics and that some of 
its leaders are accomplices of the Budapest power structure.... 
  One cannot leave without commentary Adrian Nastase's 
"political science" analysis and the intentions of the SZDP. One 
must take his ideas seriously. After all, what he planned is a 
challenge, a challenge to a "game of chess" which it would be a 
sin to begin unprepared. Thus, it would be good to set aside for 
a while internal disputes, and put out heads together, so that 
in this game, which promises to be serious, there would be no 
gaps left, even by accident, in the unprotected defense lines of 
the RMDSZ....

  [Text] Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu received 
this evening a Chinese military delegation led by Colonel 
General Zhang Wannian, member of the Central Military Commission 
and chief of staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who 
is visiting our country on the invitation of the Romanian 
Ministry of National Defense. The meeting was attended by 
Lieutenant General Dumitru Cioflina, chief of staff of the 
Romanian Army. 
  After conveying to the Romanian prime minister greetings 
from 
his counterpart, the guest expressed satisfaction that the good 
Romanian-Chinese relations, unaltered by the changes that have 
taken place in international life, continue to develop in the 
spirit of the old traditions that bind us. 
  The visit of the delegation that he is leading, through its 
very rich program and through the various exchanges of opinions 
that it occasions, makes a contribution to a better 
familiarization of the sides with each other and to the 
enhancement of relations of cooperation between the two armies 
and two countries. 
  The prime minister assured the Chinese guest that the 
Romanian people follow with keen interest China's outstanding 
achievements on the road to economic reform in the past 15 years 
and also assured him that this country, with its huge potential, 
represents one of the current foreign political guide marks of 
Romania. 
  As a continuation of bilateral contacts in the past months, 
the visit to Romania of Li Peng, premier of the State Council of 
the People's Republic of China, scheduled for summer 1994, is 
expected with great interest, reads a press release faxed to us 
by a spokesman for the government.

  [Text] Today President Iliescu received Hort 
Waffenschmidt, parliamentary state secretary in the German 
Interior Ministry of the Federal Government in charge of 
problems of expatriates, at Cotroceni Palace. 
  The guest stated to the press that on this occasion the 
sides 
discussed issues referring to cooperation between Romania and 
Germany and he showed satisfaction with the development of 
economic relations in the past months. Waffenschmidt said that 
the German minority in Romania represents a connecting bridge 
between the two countries and he expressed thanks for every 
positive action taken for the ethnic Germans. 
  However, he did voice some claims, such as exemption from 
German taxes for humanitarian aid from Germany, a better 
selection of television programs in the German language, and the 
implementation of the land law, and called for a public 
declaration to be issued that refers to discrimination after 
World War II in Romania and the new cooperation between Romania 
and Germany. He also stressed that Germany and Romania should 
cooperate in Europe and see to it that people on this continent 
live in peace and freedom, which is an essential requirement of 
a united Europe. 
  In turn, President Ion Iliescu, answering a question on 
customs duties on humanitarian aid and on the implementation of 
the land law, said that these problems concern the Romanian 
state and its citizens and they will be examined with interest; 
however, they are part and parcel of a larger group of problems 
that our country is currently facing. 
  Iliescu also said that he believes that the Deutsche Welle 
radio station presents the realities of Romania in a malicious 
and subjective manner and added that what disturbs us is not 
fair criticism but the distortion of reality, our correspondent 
Sorin Croitorescu informed us.

  [Text] At the invitation of General Tadeusz Wilecki, head 
of the General Staff of the Polish Army, on 4 May General 
Anatoli Vasilievich Lopata, head of the General Staff of the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces, will visit Poland. The Ukrainian 
commander is accompanied by a group of high-ranking officers 
representing, among others, the air defense forces, 
communication forces, and logistics services. 
  The visit is an important element of developing military 
contacts between both armies. During their visit to our 
country, the Ukrainian delegation will be received by National 
Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk; it will also hold working 
talks in the General Staff of the Polish Army. It is expected 
that such problems as technical cooperation and issues related

  In line with the program of their stay in Poland, the 
Ukrainian guests will also become familiar with the scientific 
achievements of the Military Technical Academy, will listen to 
the observations of the marine servicemen of the Third Flotilla 
of Ships, and will visit the Higher Air Force Officers School in 
Deblin. 
  The delegation of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces will also place a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown 
Soldier.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Deputy Wojciech Lamentowicz, political </F>
analyst and Union of Labor activist, by correspondent Wojciech 
Gielzynski; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Gielzynski] The president's strategic objective 
is quite clear: a second term of office, to be spent in the two 
palaces [the Belweder and the Namiestnikowski Palace]. It is 
more difficult to assess the president's recent vigorous moves. 
Is he regaining his good form, or is he becoming nervous? 
  [Lamentowicz] These moves were ineffective from the 
viewpoint of his objectives, and they also demonstrated that he 
could be a possible factor in Poland's destabilization. The 
president is throwing a monkey wrench into the works of a moving 
vehicle. He is trying to interfere with the progress of forces 
he can no longer control. And so he is losing. Those among the 
public who understand what is going on see his behavior as 
desperate attempts to halt processes that are unfavorable from 
the viewpoint of Walesa's personal goals: another term in 
office as president. He makes these attempts using increasingly 
dramatic methods and resorting to very poor style. His image is 
increasingly that of an ineffectual and tragicomic politician 
because he cannot understand that he is losing and behaves as if 
he were winning. 
  [Gielzynski] But, recently, he seems to have regained a part 
of his old support force--that is, Solidarity. 
  [Lamentowicz] I do not think so. Walesa has distanced 
himself from most of the political groups hailing originally 
from Solidarity, and they are no longer able to vote for him. 
To begin with, he antagonized the center groups and the 
Democratic Union, and then he declared war on the right wing's 
"useless duds." In turn, the Union of Labor has never felt 
inclined to cultivate close relations with him. Ours is the 
only political group that has never sent him birthday wishes in 
any form. We decided that the president's birthday is his 
private affair and pointed out that he does not send us birthday 
greetings, either. Moreover, ours is the only group that did 
not take part in the ceremonial signing of the concordat 
agreement. 
  [Gielzynski] Even so, Walesa still has some fragments of 
political support from such groups as the Nonparty Bloc in 
Support of Reforms. 
  [Lamentowicz] Yes, he has such fragmentary support, but his 
advisers are weakening as a group. He constructed a most 
peculiar system of councils, a whole network of them, whose 
advice he has always ignored and ignores even now. They are made 
up of several hundred people, mostly eminent and respected 
figures, who have allowed themselves to be drawn into something 
that is a complete fabrication. It is most embarrassing to have 
to tell those people that they are involved in a fictitious 
undertaking, but, if they had any self-esteem, they would 
withdraw from it themselves. As it is, they willingly accept 
the status of "ignored advisers." Other people are quite 
scandalized about this state of affairs. I believe that someone 
who first appoints them to advisory positions and then treats 
them so perfunctorily does not deserve any trust himself. The 
creation of that fictitious advisory system is one of Walesa's 
fundamental mistakes. 
  [Gielzynski] But there is also a narrow circle of Walesa's 
true advisers. 
  [Lamentowicz] Nevertheless, I am inclined to think that it 
has a rather poor reputation--deservedly poor. Walesa's real 
advisers, with whom he works closely, are people who are 
decidedly uninteresting and without any good ideas. 
  [Gielzynski] So, do the fictitious advisers have good 
ideas then? 
  [Lamentowicz] Perhaps if Walesa had listened to their 
counsel more often, he would have avoided making many mistakes. 
What they suggested to him was often completely different from 
what he actually did. Moreover, Walesa's further mistake is 
that he introduced a method of ruling through his "personal 
court." In any democracy, particularly one that has only just 
been formed and is still very young, when people are highly 
sensitive to the need to respect its principles, the development 
of a "courtly rule" mechanism, with an emperorlike figure at its 
center, is completely disgraceful. It is tantamount to sneering 
at people's good judgment and common sense. What Walesa has 
done with the Belweder Palace is a sin against tradition and 
against democracy. Even Pilsudski did not drag the Belweder, as 
a national institution, so low that it was derided as a place of 
ridicule. Pilsudski may have been criticized for many valid 
reasons, but he did retain the dignity of his office. No one 
could ever have thought of him as a political clown. 
  [Gielzynski] Do you not think that now Walesa has even lost 
his ability to apply his "shorthand" style in speech and his 
colorful way of expressing his thoughts in brilliantly pithy 
phrases such as "I am for it, and even against it," an ability 
that is, after all, the quintessence of diplomacy? 
  [Lamentowicz] The president still has such stylistic 
leanings because he is incapable of speaking in precise terms. 
However, that is not his gravest offense. In 1980, he also 
spoke in his characteristic style, but he was serious then. 
  [Gielzynski] Then he had both his charisma and his 
intuition.... 
  [Lamentowicz] Exactly--and also people who worked with him 
and were not ignored or ridiculed by him for protecting and 
defending him as their leader. Walesa appears to be incapable 
of appreciating the truth that politics is a team game that must 
be played in tandem with groups of people representing larger 
sections of the public who choose to hold the same kind of 
views. He seemingly no longer understands that politics is made 
together with people, not above their heads. Instead, he is 
still given to thinking up fanciful concepts such as giving each 
citizen 100 or 300 million zlotys, "sending certain people home 
in their socks," "devising a master plan," and so on. In 
Walesa's mind, such concepts seem to replace the need to do some 
solid thinking in terms of programs. Today, even the least 
critical observers can see for themselves that these are just 
empty phrases, that there is nothing behind them but an ambition 
to hang on to his position at the Belweder or the 
Namiestnikowski [Regent's] Palace. The latter name seems 
symbolic indeed because Walesa is given to parading in office 
rather than discharging a public office. However, this is not 
going to last for very long now.

<F P=106> [Article by Mariusz Janicki: "Who the President Listens to; </F>
Theoretically, the President Has a Few Hundred Advisers"] 
  [Text] The president is not able to know everything, even 
though he must rule the entire state--that is, everything. 
Therefore, he should have advisers--people who, for free or for 
a fee, share their knowledge with the head of state. The 
president may, but he does not have to, accept their 
suggestions. As it turns out, in practice, he most often "does 
not have to." 
  The president has almost 700 advisers, not counting his 
closest aides in the Office. These are members of the 
presidential councils, of which there are 12. another one is 
being established--the council for veteran affairs. This costs 
the President's Office approximately 700 million zlotys per 
year--the return of the costs, hotels, and mineral water. There 
have already been cases of returning money for air tickets on 
international routes (a member of the council for sport issues) 
and for a journey in a state car with a driver (a member of the 
scientific council). Added to this are printing costs--whatever 
is invented by the councils is printed--sometimes in the form of 
thick books. The councils also receive meals, even though their 
members complain about the quality. 
  Among the president's advisers are over 150 professors and 
more than 200 scientists with lesser titles. There are 10 
priests and one bishop. Only five persons are called "lawyers." 
Moreover, the councils include journalists, peasants, sportsmen, 
scouts, writers, artists, businessmen, architects, and 
politicians. As a matter of fact, there are not many well-known 
and active politicians, apart from Bronislaw Geremek and 
Aleksander Malachowski. Incidentally, their roles are apolitical 
there. 
  The councils convene every second month, on average. The 
teams into which they are usually divided may meet more 
frequently. The president tries to attend every third meeting 
of each council, but he does not always make it. In practice, he 
attends the session of each council once a year. He has not yet 
met with the council for youth affairs. How, then, does he find 
out about the councils' advice? "In various ways--for example, 
from the press. It is always known when a meeting of one of the 
councils has been held. Apart from that, there are reports. It 
is not true that the president does not read anything. He likes 
theoretical political works, for instance, or reminiscences of 
politicians very much. Moreover, sessions are attended by his 
civil servants," says Minister Andrzej Zakrzewski, head of the 
Bureau of Political Servicing of the Office (he coordinates the 
activities of eight councils). The councils are supposed to act 
entirely independently. If the president wants to ask them about 
something, he will do so. It is worth adding that he does this 
rarely. Moreover, the councils were established as a result of 
initiatives of the people themselves: They came and said that 
they wanted to establish a council with the president. This 
gives importance. Therefore, their expectations cannot be too 
great. Recently, the president stated that he does not want any 
more councils, but the veterans still managed to ask for their 
own council. The employees of education may not have such a 
chance. "If we had accepted all of the motions, there would 
already be 50 councils," claims Andrzej Kojder, the main expert 
in the Political Servicing Bureau. Thus, all along, the 
councils have been in the wrong place--they were left far from 
the decisionmaking processes. They turned into discussion clubs 
that at some higher level are taken care of by Lech Walesa. 
Therefore, the thesis submitted by the Belweder's opponents 
that the councils would be the basis of a presidential 
government is not very realistic. 
  The councils are not satisfied with the president: He 
attends their sessions only rarely. It is not known to what 
extent he takes advantage of the experts' efforts. He does not 
give any feedback. Nor is the president satisfied with the 
councils: He says that they have become another forum at which 
the complaints and frustrations of various milieus are 
discussed, that their members simply want to get something done 
via the Belweder, that they do not submit any legislative 
drafts, even though the president has the right to launch a 
legislative initiative. He presents his complaints right at 
those meetings. A. Zakrzewski: "The president at one point 
interrupts a speaker and says: I am not satisfied with you all. 
Tell me what I should do, give me addresses, telephone numbers; 
work on a joint stand." Lech Falandysz, deputy of the head of 
the Office (he coordinates the work of two councils; one council 
is taken care of by Andrzej Kozakiewicz, and the council for 
media affairs by the President's Press Office) adds: "In 
general, Lech Walesa is not keen on lawyers. The same goes for 
Mieczyslaw Wachowski, who is very businesslike with me. Walesa 
probably no longer considers me a lawyer, and this is why he 
tolerates me. He is a practical man, and he often emphasizes 
it. His presidency is of an amateurish-sentimental, not 
professional, nature, and that is all right with me. I could 
not work with another president." 
  There are better councils and there are worse councils; much 
depends on the chairman. Andrzej Kajetan Wroblewski, who steers 
the scientific council with an iron hand, is listed as a model 
to follow. Also, the councils for agriculture and social policy 
work quite well. The former established contacts with Minister 
Smietanko. It is believed in the Office that the other councils 
should also meet with appropriate ministers; rhaps then they 
will become more specific and useful. However, not all of the 
ministers want that because, in fact, the councils are 
presidential not governmental. 
  The creative work that has been accomplished by the councils 
is various. Apart from issues that are really serious and 
strategic, in the list of achievements one finds such items as: 
"obtaining additional money for publishing a book by U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore," "declaration for Polish public opinion, 
expressing concern about the political climate in Poland," or 
"the resolution of a conflict related to the Frederic Chopin 
Society." Just as the president does not have a concept for the 
councils, the councils do not have a concept for themselves. 
The plenary sessions of the councils are more like a 
stereotype; their structure is more that of a seminar than of an 
advisory body: attendance list, opening address, discussion, 
conclusions, setting the date and the subject of the next 
session. Attendance is not very good. And all of this is 
happening in a vacuum. The councils' members are rather 
unanimous in saying that they do not really know whether the 
council is simply the prolongation of their scientific work and 
they are supposed to behave as they do at their universities, or 
it requires effort and a different attitude from them. However, 
there is no feedback for that. 
  Andrzej Kojder believes that there are too many well-known 
people in the councils who also have a hundred other tasks, who 
are members of various bodies, and for whom membership in the 
presidential council is a matter of prestige. They would very 
gladly meet with the president in the salons of the Belweder and 
drink coffee with him there. However, the president does not 
have time for that. 
  Indeed, the councils swarm with prominent names. One 
cannot say no to the president. There was only one such case: A 
representative of the Independent Association of University 
Students [NZS], who was invited to become a member of the 
council for youth affairs, rejected the offer because the NZS 
had not liked the president for some time then. Still, members 
of the councils are such people as Jerzy Turowicz, Piotr 
Buchner, Gustaw Holoubek, Adam Michnik, Leszek Balcerowicz, 
Wieslaw Ochman, Marcin Krol, Sobieslaw Zasada, Bronislaw 
Geremek, Jan Nowak-Jezioranski, Ryszard Kapuscinski, Father 
Wieslaw Nieweglowski, Aleksander Gieysztor, Lena Kolarska- 
Bobinska, Henryk Samsonowicz, Marek Rostworowski, and many 
others. These are all first-league people. There arises the 
question, then, why contact with the president is so poor and 
why the advisory usefulness of the councils is so small. Only 
twice did the president quote the opinions of the councils when 
he made a decision: when he agreed to the candidacy of Zbigniew 
Klajnert for culture minister in the Suchocka government and, 
for the second time and not so directly, in the case of the 
self-governmental election law, which he finally vetoed. 
Andrzej Zakrzewski: "Giving advice to Lech Walesa is difficult, 
extremely difficult. It must be done very skillfully, and much 
patience is required. At the start, the president most often 
does not want to listen to anything. Later on, when he thinks 
about it quietly, reads something, he sometimes changes his 
mind." Lech Falandysz: "Telling the president that he is to do 
this or that, or at least that he should do this or that, is out 
of the question. The entire issue can be forgotten. The style 
favored in the Belweder is that of the military: If something is 
pulled off, no one will commend you; if not, you will be 
reprimanded. People must often work and say things they think 
they should. Lech Walesa wants to have not advisers but 
generals, who would present him with several options; he would 
then choose one or think about his own option. This is why the 
professorial style of giving advice, full of reservations and 
doubts, does not satisfy him." Another Office civil servant, 
who wanted to remain anonymous, claims that the concept of 
advice-giving bodies is not very good now. The Research and 
Analysis Office does not really fulfill its function. The 
20-person legal office, which, among other things, reviews all 
of the laws before they are signed by the president, must often 
give up its suggestions when it hears political arguments. 
There are no good relations between the law and politics. There 
is no advisory body that would have powers in both these areas, 
which would include outstanding specialists capable of 
convincing Lech Walesa of their political abilities, which is 
not easy because the president believes that he is the greatest 
political talent in the country--the greatest and the only 
talent. Besides, the president would have to trust such people, 
and this may be the most difficult matter. 
  Andrzej Zakrzewski: "Lech Walesa had bad experiences with 
political advisers at the time they were led by Zdzislaw Najder. 
After the Belweder was conquered by the Center Accord, the 
entire milieu linked to the Democratic Union moved away from 
him. The situation has not changed up to now. The president 
lacks this potential. It will not be replaced by existing 
councils, even if they are twice as numerous." 
  It looks like the president receives various, poorly 
coordinated signals, both important and not very important, on 
the basis of which he makes his decisions. Therefore, the 
decisions often mirror the nature and the level of the advice 
the head of state receives. Perhaps the situation looks like 
this: He does not trust those people who might give him sound 
advice, and those he trusts give such advice as they can give. 
Three years ago, my colleagues in POLITYKA wrote about the 
"loneliness of Mr. President." Since that time, many people 
have come and gone from the Belweder; however, the president 
still seems to be alone, even though he has a few hundred 
advisers. It is not known for sure whether this is a choice or 
a necessity.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ryszard Bugaj, chairman of Union of Labor, </F>
by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on 
the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Woyciechowski] Let us go 
back for a moment to the political nature of these strikes. Do 
you think the political nature of the strikes is associated with 
the coming presidential election, or is it perhaps still too 
early? 
  [Bugaj] You know, I do not think so. At any rate, I think 
that, so far, the president has been acting with some restraint. 
I have had the opportunity in the past to voice views in this 
very studio that were critical of the president, but, regarding 
this conflict, I must say he has been demonstrating restraint.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Will you vote for Walesa in 
the presidential election? 
  [Bugaj] I do not think so. I hope there will be a 
countercandidate for whom I could vote.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And what kind of candidate 
would it have to be? Let us not give specific names. 
  [Bugaj] You know, I would put it this way--and you are right 
about not mentioning any names. Whether he would be someone of 
left-wing or right-wing views--that is rather irrelevant to me, 
or at least I see that as a secondary issue. But, of course, I 
would like him to be someone who respects the Constitution very 
much, who is capable of resolving situations relevant to the 
president, and who is capable of being an umpire and of enjoying 
strong authority. But I must say I would prefer this person not 
to have very strong views because it might happen that he will 
have to cooperate with very different types of government, of a 
very different nature, with very different [words indistinct] 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do you know of such a person? 
Is there anyone like that in Poland? 
  [Bugaj] You know, I know an enormous number of such people, 
indeed, but the problem is that none of those figures are 
distinguished or outstanding enough to be able to take up the 
post without problems. I think there are such people in the 
Freedom Union [UW], and perhaps I could find them in our party, 
too. I would not hesitate to say there are also such people at 
the very right-wing end of the political scene. I think the 
most important matter is that we shape the Constitution in a way 
that would prevent the presidency from becoming something like 
the chief executive office, or something of that nature 
because.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And can I ask you to give a 
name now? 
  [Bugaj] You know, what I think is that, for instance, when 
it comes to the UW, both Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Jacek Kuron are 
the kinds of people who fulfill my criteria, and when it comes 
to our circles, both Karol Modzelewski and, for instance, 
Aleksander Malachowski fulfill the criteria. Which does not 
mean that they want or are able to run--that is a separate 
issue. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Jolanta Koral: "Trilateral Dispute Over </F>
Popiwek"] 
  [Text] The government, trade unions, and employers failed 
to come to an agreement yesterday on lifting the neopopiwek 
[enterprise tax on above-normative pay]. Trade unions and 
employers do not want the neopopiwek to be reinstated, whereas 
the government insists that the neopopiwek be in force until the 
end of the year. 
  Abandonment of the neopopiwek is one of the main demands put 
forward by Solidarity during its strikes. The All-Polish Trade 
Unions Agreement [OPZZ] and other trade union centers also agree 
with the demand. 
<H5>  Strikes Continue </H5>
  Solidarity is dissatisfied with the results of talks within 
the trilateral commission. "There is no reason to stop the 
strike action," Ewa Lewicka of Solidarity told GAZETA WYBORCZA. 
"There is almost nothing we have managed to resolve completely, 
the government failed to come up with specific solutions, and a 
time schedule for meeting the demands of Solidarity, on which 
stopping the strike action depends, has not been agreed upon." 
  "Strikes as an invitation to talks place the government in a 
very difficult situation," Andrzej Baczkowski, deputy labor 
minister and the commission's chief, told journalists. 
<H5>  OPZZ Will See To It? </H5>
  The government insists that the popiwek be reinstated now so 
as to prevent an eruption of inflation. It will be possible to 
lift the popiwek no sooner than the beginning of next year. 
  But employers and trade unionists do not fear excessive 
increases in salaries. OPZZ Deputy Chairman Maciej Manicki has 
told GAZETA WYBORCZA that, if the popiwek becomes law, the OPZZ 
will file a lawsuit with the Constitutional Tribunal. "We will 
see to it that salaries do not rise by more than the 27 percent 
contained in the budget. Other trade unions should also reduce 
employee appetites for the popiwek," Manicki declared during the 
commission's session. 
  "Over 200 trade unions are active in Poland, but there are 
only a few talking in this meeting hall," replied Deputy Finance 
Minister Waldemar Manugiewicz. "How does the OPZZ plan to go 
about managing the salary situation in all of the enterprises?" 
<H5>  Flexible Abandonment of the Popiwek </H5>
  Despite this lack of agreement over the popiwek, Solidarity 
will talk within the commission about abandoning it, by, among 
other means, introducing a regulation of salaries through 
collective agreements and through commercialization of 
state-owned enterprises. 
  The commission determined that the government will address 
the Sejm Presidium to have parliament adopt the so-called 
Chapter 11 of the Labor Law Code as soon as possible (this is 
provided for by the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises). The 
chapter provides that the most important employee issues--such 
as salaries, working conditions, and so forth--should be decided 
jointly by employers and employee representations. 
  Adopting the law is indispensable for a lifting of popiwek. 
Then salary increases would no longer be directed centrally but, 
instead, would depend on collective agreements within 
enterprises. 
  What would also happen is that the current automatic 
dependence of salary increases in the production sector on such 
increases in the budget sector would be eliminated. Solidarity 
wants salaries for budget sector employees to be dependent on 
increases in the GDP. 
  In addition, valorizations of retirement and other kinds of 
pensions would be based not on increases in average salaries the 
way they are now but, instead, on increases in prices and in 
living expenses. (The government is supposed to present its 
proposals on this issue as soon as possible.) 
<H5>  Companies Full Speed Ahead! </H5>
  According to Deputy Ownership Transformations Minister 
Andrzej Zebrowski, a commercialization of state-owned 
enterprises is a precondition for a lifting of the popiwek (the 
government has preliminarily approved of a draft law). The 
commercialization would be about gradually transforming the 
enterprises into companies of Commercial Law--for instance, into 
share companies--in which the state would participate. 
  The government would start with the most efficient 
enterprises first. Those enterprises that have economic losses 
would be subjected to supervision by contract managers before 
they are commercialized, which would make it possible to improve 
their financial results. The worst enterprises would simply be 
dissolved, but only after a plan for a further management of 
their wealth is prepared. 
  In the companies, supervisory boards would be set up, which 
would conclude collective agreements. A decision was made that 
the government is supposed to come up with proposals concerning 
the commercialization of enterprises by 15 June. 
  On 16 May, in turn, the commission will be dealing with a 
draft law on the privatization of state-owned enterprises (this 
is one of the laws making up the Agreement on State-Owned 
Enterprises). Among other things, the draft law describes the 
principles of employee participation in the privatization of an 
enterprise. 
<H5>  A Time Schedule? Not Yet </H5>
  According to Solidarity, commercialization will go on for 
years, whereas salaries should be shaped through collective 
agreements and not through the popiwek. That is why Solidarity 
wants the popiwek to be lifted as soon as possible through the 
adoption of Chapter 11 of the Labor Law Code. 
  When asked about the impact of talks within the trilateral 
commission on the strikes, Longin Komolowski, a member of the 
Solidarity National Commission and of the strike headquarters, 
replied: "We have not reached the stage yet where we would be 
ready to accept a time schedule for working on the trade union's 
demands." 
  Let us recall that Solidarity has been making the end to the 
strike action dependent on approving such a time schedule and on 
the government's specific proposals and measures. 
<H5>  What They Managed To Agree Upon </H5>
  The government agreed to meeting the demand by Solidarity 
that people who compute their taxes along with their spouses be 
able to make the lowest amount of advance tax payment. Deputy 
[Finance] Minister Manugiewicz reported that the Finance 
Ministry has already prepared a legal measure regarding the 
issue, and the commission is due to debate it on 16 May. The 
government also approves of the idea that, effective in 1995, 
tax breaks be introduced that would take into account the cost 
of commuting to work (the government is to submit its proposals 
soon.) 
  On 16 May, the commission is also scheduled to deal with a 
second batch of demands by Solidarity: a popular enfranchisement 
of citizens, reducing the workweek to 40 hours, social support 
for the poorest families, and salaries for budget-sector 
employees. 
  Solidarity initially refused to agree to the 16 May date. 
"It is too late," the trade unionists said. They insisted that 
this amounts to a violation of the Konin agreement. They made 
it clear that the strike may spread even further by 16 May. The 
government was trying to convince the trade unionists that it 
needs the time to prepare its proposals. But, in the end, 
Solidarity was outvoted on the issue.

<F P=106> [Article by Janusz Jankowiak: "Grandpa Kolodko and Our </F>
Troubles"] 
  [Text] Who is Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz W. 
Kolodko? He is someone who, while writing an economic report on 
the postcommunist era, is capable of mentioning Balcerowicz's 
name just once, in a footnote, while not even once mentioning 
Dariusz Rosati (who, after all, was the founding father of the 
anti-Balcerowicz opposition). Instead, Kolodko mentions his own 
works, articles, and short reports more than 10 times. 
  Sure, one can do it this way, too. Let us not ignore the 
fact that the above sheds some light on character-related vices 
and professional qualifications of the most recent deputy prime 
minister/finance minister. 
<H5>  Anti-Winiecki </H5>
  Because we described Rosati as one of the founding fathers, 
Kolodko deserves the description of the grandfather of the 
anti-Balcerowicz opposition, or, at any rate, he deserves the 
description of someone older and famous for his authority in 
this harmonious family. 
  Kolodko is a fundamentalist critic of the changes taking 
place in the postcommunist economy. Placed next to him, Rosati 
is indeed a real gentle lamb. ("The concept of a transformation 
policy carried out, in practice, has lead to a situation where a 
huge drop in output is accompanied by an avalanche-type increase 
in unemployment and an extensive crisis in public finances. It 
would be hard to find clearer proof of the mistaken nature of 
this concept," the current deputy prime minister writes.) 
  Against this backdrop, Kolodko's position on the economic 
legacy of the Polish People's Republic [PRL] is quite special. 
While writing about some mistakes that were made, he speaks at 
the same time about dynamic growth and a balanced budget. This 
reminds me of a subtle admonition, with many elements of 
affirmation contained in it. There is no doubt that Kolodko's 
assessment of Poland after 1989 is much harsher than that of the 
PRL period. Naturally, he has a right to that. 
  But it is hard to avoid the feeling that there is a very 
personal and emotional attitude of Kolodko on the issues he 
evaluates, lying at the very core of his criticism. If I were 
to sketch a psychological portrait of Grzegorz Kolodko, I would 
have to say that this very talented economist, by his decision 
to associate himself with a political orientation that went into 
opposition after the fall of PRL, had no direct influence on the 
direction of economic changes in Poland after 1989. 
  A wounded ambition and complex of the rejected have been 
shaping the aggressive tone of many of Kolodko's public 
statements. Haughtiness and a lack of respect for those who have 
different views--and also unconcealed joy over their 
mistakes--can all be sensed in the statements. Every now and 
then, a reader of Kolodko's works comes across: "official 
optimism of the new elites," "nonsense plans and forecasts," "a 
new propaganda of success," "a lack of realism, professionalism, 
and insufficient imagination," "atrophy of the sense of 
responsibility," "manipulating the confused public opinion," 
"economic charlatanry," "neoliberal orthodoxy," "populism," and 
similar terms. 
  It is interesting that Grzegorz Kolodko finds an alter ego 
in 
the Polish economic literature. That alter ego is Professor Jan 
Winiecki, a representative of constitutional liberalism, a 
hard-working fighter against socialism, which, in Winiecki's 
view, is the result of a mental aberration. 
  It would be hard to imagine two people so different from one 
another and yet so similar as Kolodko and Winiecki. They are 
different on literally everything: the past and their views. 
What is common to them is the style of writing and the type of 
personality. In both cases, we are dealing with people who are 
intolerant and who cannot take criticism. It is enough to 
familiarize oneself with any piece written by either man. 
  I doubt that these are the best references for someone to 
manage the economy of a country with 40 million people. At any 
rate, Kolodko tends to be an anti-Winiecki of the governing 
coalition rather than its anti-Balcerowicz (which Rosati was). 
It seems that the difference is rather significant. 
  [Union of Labor Chairman] Ryszard Bugaj has described 
Kolodko 
as a red liberal. As far as colors are concerned, I do not feel 
authorized to speak out. As far as liberalism is concerned, 
however, in my view Bugaj is wrong. Kolodko is definitely an 
economist of modern social democracy's left wing. He is to the 
left of not only Balcerowicz but also of Rosati, even though, 
naturally, he is to the right of Bugaj at the same time. 
  But, according to traditional left-wing standards of the 
1970's, Kolodko is still a liberal because he has spoken out 
many times against the budget being burdened with social 
expenditures to an excessive degree (such as is happening now), 
against inflation, spinning the demand side, and against a 
permanent budget deficit. He has stressed the need to reduce the 
public debt, the need to legalize the economic "gray zone," and 
has demanded restrictive monetary policies. 
  But, according to standards of constitutional liberalism, 
literally nothing that Kolodko has to say on economy, can be 
defended--that is, except for just one issue: his position on 
the balance of public finances. On an orthodox scale, Kolodko 
is an incomplete quarter-liberal, at the most. Never mind the 
colors. 
<H5>  The Absolutely Indispensable State </H5>
  Kolodko negates an emergence in the postcommunist economy of 
an independent mechanism widely known in regular market systems, 
which causes growth after a period of depression. Such an 
argument implies that the state is ascribed an active role in 
setting economic growth in motion. So Kolodko draws a logical 
conclusion that allowing for "creative destruction" after 1989 
was a major mistake. Institutional and structural changes 
should not have been implemented through shock, like a 
macroeconomic stabilization. The indispensable transformations 
"should have been managed by the governments with sensitivity." 
That is a clear suggestion that the state uphold part of the 
inefficient demand, which is an outlet for costly and obsolete 
production. 
  Generally speaking, Kolodko's expectations vis-a-vis the 
state are high. The state is not only supposed to contribute to 
securing the proper conditions for stabilization and to deal 
with establishing a market infrastructure, but, in Kolodko's 
view, must also get involved in the process of allocating 
capital and must direct that capital to those places where, 
according to the government, it will be utilized in the best 
possible manner. The state should even demonstrate "direct 
production activity." 
  The state/the owner should manage its own wealth well. There 
would be nothing wrong with this otherwise correct statement by 
Kolodko if it were not for another idea being promoted by the 
professor--namely, that "one must not privatize more or faster 
than is possible." Someone could draw the conclusion from this 
that there is too much privatization in Poland and that it is 
taking place too fast. But that would be a completely false 
conclusion. Kolodko's position on privatization is confusing. 
He thinks the rate of privatization is not very impressive 
currently and so one must increase it. So the warning mentioned 
earlier is understood to be of a preventative nature. 
  But, for those who managed to "swallow" the warning while 
concentrating primarily on the announcement of greater 
privatization than up to now, Professor Kolodko has another 
surprise up his sleeve: He says there is a close relationship 
between the rate of privatization and the level of state 
activity. It seems like a quite trivial thing. In strictly 
technical terms, all it means is that the more somebody sells, 
the harder he has to work. But it cannot be ruled out that this 
argument by Kolodko should be interpreted in less trivial 
fashion: The faster the rate of privatization, the more 
government involvement in the economy. 
<H5>  A Pentagon Out of Sync </H5>
  To define Kolodko's economic views, his position on the 
unemployment issue may also be quite helpful. Fortunately, in 
this regard, we are no longer condemned to trying to track down 
unclear traces. 
  Grzegorz Kolodko is the author of a theoretical concept that 
allows one to measure the level of economic stabilization in 
practically every country of the world. His "stabilization 
pentagon" (described in a separate book) is an intellectually 
interesting attempt at defining the relationship among the 
growth of national product, unemployment, inflation, the state 
of the budget, and the current balance of payments. 
  In the view of many economists, the practical utility of the 
pentagon theory is rather small due to many simplifications 
contained in it (for instance ignoring the NAIRU [expansion 
unknown] indicator, which means unemployment rate not resulting 
in increased inflation, or Kolodko's assumption that the cost of 
bringing inflation down, as measured by unemployment, increases 
in a linear fashion, which is obviously false, inasmuch as 
bringing inflation from 600 percent down to 60 percent is less 
costly than a reduction from 60 percent to 6 percent). That is 
why one must take a distanced position on the dogmatic views on 
the miserable effects of stabilization in postcommunist 
economies, as determined by using the pentagon theory. 
  What is more important is that Kolodko's concept makes it 
possible to describe in much better terms the economic trend to 
which he belongs. For instance, according to Kolodko, 
stabilization increases along with production, and the faster 
unemployment falls, the greater the degree of stabilization. 
This is undoubtedly a result of the growth theory as viewed by 
social democrats, which ignores the issue of the cost of using 
resources. In the eyes of liberals, that omission absolutely 
disqualifies the pentagon theory as a credible economic 
instrument. 
  Charges concerning links between stabilization and the 
state of the current balance of state payments are of a similar 
nature. Kolodko completely ignores the significance of the 
inflow and outflow of capital, for the state's balance of 
payments. But, in reality--and this is demonstrated not just by 
the case of Poland--even a significant deficit of current 
turnover going on for years does not necessarily have to drain 
state hard-currency reserves. 
  It looks as if the author, while creating his pentagon, 
picked and chose those elements (unemployment, trade deficit) 
that support the theory on the miserable effects of 
stabilization, while rejecting (in the assumptions that 
simplified the model) anything that could contradict the 
argument of the miserable effects of stabilization. 
<H5>  A State-Controlled Kick in the Pants </H5>
  Kolodko's nomination is significant for a number of reasons: 
  First, the left wing finally has its own transition ritual. 
The left wing's economic team is being headed by a prestigious, 
talented, and very aggressive critic of Balcerowicz's policies. 
  Second, the return to Kolodko's candidacy is, in a way, a 
gesture of despair on the part of the Democratic Left Alliance 
and the prime minister himself. I am saying that because what 
really happened between fall and spring to make Kolodko's 
comeback possible? The deputy prime minister has written 
somewhere that neoliberalism begets populism. Someone could 
make the observation now that Prof. Kolodko has finally gained 
power on the basis of that very populism. 
  Third, the confusion surrounding the finance minister 
demonstrated that politicians of a single camp are capable of 
promoting people of quite differing views for the economy's 
chief over a relatively short period of time. 
  A nomination of Rosati would make it likely that an easing 
of 
monetary policies will take place, which means introducing more 
money into the economy, but it would also mean increasing the 
state's fiscal discipline (for instance, a restrictive execution 
of tax laws and of other laws resulting in revenue for the state 
budget, or carrying out enterprise insolvencies). Kolodko's 
concept seems to be exactly the opposite of that. In a recent 
work, he wrote about the need to apply nondogmatic "instruments 
in the area of revenues, flexible, active, and proinvestment 
fiscal policies, and restrictive monetary policies." 
  What Rosati, the would-be deputy prime minister, wanted to 
tighten, Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko, who assumed the post 
while being recommended by the same left wing, wants to ease up. 
And vice versa. What is this all about? 
  On a cautious note, I think this demonstrates the 
politicians' weak knowledge concerning detailed views by 
economists who are proposed for the state's supreme posts, or 
else it demonstrates that the politicians just do not think such 
details are very important. What is important, they think, is 
that Borowski, Rosati, and Kolodko belong to the same political 
team and so are included in the same trend that is described as 
a reformist or liberal left wing. Apart from that common 
denominator of the most general nature, everything else does not 
count. The truth is that this view is obviously false. The 
"everything else" does count a lot, by all means. 
  If Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko tries to implement 
demands that he voiced as a professor/reviewer, then it is only 
now that our economy will get a real state-controlled kick in 
the pants. 
  I think this makes it easy to understand why, from the 
standpoint of liberal economists, Rosati, the founding father, 
who was much less unequivocal than Kolodko, may have seemed like 
the lesser evil.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw </F>
Kaczmarek by correspondent Mariola Krzyzaniak; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Krzyzaniak] The most popular privatization method 
is the employees shareholding scheme. But your ministry is 
rejecting increasing numbers of applications for this form of 
ownership transformation from employees' joint-partnership 
companies. Employees resent these refusals, saying: First you 
let us choose our preferred form of privatization, and now you 
refuse to approve it. 
  [Kaczmarek] Employees' joint-partnership companies are very 
good at seeing to work forces' social welfare provisions. On 
the other hand, there are two areas they find difficult to deal 
with. The first is the price, usually too low, which the 
employees' joint companies offer in the bid to buy their 
enterprises. The second area is these companies' credibility as 
regards realization of the investment-package deals. I am an 
advocate of the quickest method of selling small and medium-size 
enterprises. I believe that, in their case, success is measured 
in terms of their stable functioning and development. I do not 
need to aim for getting the highest possible prices for them. 
However, I should like to adopt a slightly different approach 
to larger enterprises. 
  [Krzyzaniak] Where does a medium enterprise end and a large 
one begin? 
  [Kaczmarek] I think privatization by liquidation can be 
approved for enterprises employing up to 400 persons. In some 
cases, this number can be larger: We can negotiate in the case 
of enterprises with up to 500-700 employees. The upper limit is 
an enterprise whose turnover, in money terms, amounts to a 
maximum of 12 million ECU's [European Currency Units] and whose 
statutory fund and enterprise fund amount to a maximum of 8 
million ECU's. If a given enterprise fits in this category, we 
will happily approve privatization by liquidation. If it 
exceeds them, it should be privatized by capital takeover. Of 
course, in well-justified cases, we can depart from these limits. 
  [Krzyzaniak] To what extent is your limit on privatization 
through employees' shareholding schemes imposed by the 
requirement that the Ownership Transformations Ministry transfer 
all profits from privatization by capital takeover to the state 
budget? 
  [Kaczmarek] Such a requirement does exist, and we must 
remember that the state budget does not profit much from a 
transaction whereby an enterprise is sold to its employees and 
its status changed to that of a an employees' joint-partnership 
company. However, we can still view employees' 
joint-partnership companies as taxpayers. I am not against 
employees' companies. I believe we should seek solutions 
together, in partnership. 
  [Krzyzaniak] The progress of privatization has been halted 
in certain sectors, especially those connected with agriculture. 
Debates are in progress on whether privatization should be 
controlled by the Ownership Transformations Ministry solely, or 
also by other ministries, such as the Agriculture Ministry and 
the Industry and Trade Ministry. 
  [Kaczmarek] I am firmly opposed to the transfer of ownership 
transformation powers to other ministries. They should attend, 
instead, to the creation of model programs and solutions for 
individual branches of industry. We have a ready example here 
in the grain, sugar, and tobacco products manufacturing 
industries. It is strange, to say the least, that the same 
ministry that halts the privatization of tobacco products 
manufacturing enterprises issues licenses to other firms to 
build new cigarette factories. Of course, we, too, implement 
model solutions. An example here is the National Investment 
Funds project. The only people with sufficient expertise on 
privatization can be found at the Ownership Transformations 
Ministry and voivodship offices. We often hear complaints about 
the privatization schemes and, consequently, about my ministry. 
But the majority of investigation proceedings, prosecution 
cases, protests, and problems with ownership supervision that 
accompany the implementation of the privatization scheme are 
connected with other sectors. 
  [Krzyzaniak] Nevertheless, there has been a noticeable 
slowing down of the privatization processes. One of the reasons 
for this is the conflict between individual ministries over 
their respective ranges of competence. What is the source of 
this conflict? 
  [Kaczmarek] Without any doubt, work on the Enterprises Pact 
and the associated promise of the issue of free shares to 
employees caused considerable delays. Employees preferred to 
wait until the pact came into force. I declare that I will not 
touch the 20 percent of shares reserved for employees. Another 
reason is that the management structure at the voivodship level 
is currently undergoing a series of changes, and it is in 
voivodships that two-thirds of all privatization operations take 
place. 
  [Krzyzaniak] Foreign investors buy shares in our factories 
when they bring their money to Poland. There is also another 
group of investors that builds factories from scratch on our 
territory: these are the so-called greenfield projects. 
Examples of the latter practice are the chocolate factory near 
Wroclaw that is being built by Cutberry [as published; Cadbury 
would have been intended but transcribed incorrectly by 
interviewer] or the Dutch-Japanese battery-manufacturing plant 
in Gniezno. These plants are often competitive in relation to 
already established Polish enterprises. 
  [Kaczmarek] My principal area of responsibility is to 
encourage foreign investors interested in Polish enterprises to 
undertake to transform and modernize these enterprises. Today 
these projects receive priority status in which a strategic 
investor enters the enterprise. On the other hand, I cannot say 
I am not interested in the greenfield projects you just 
mentioned. They provide additional bridging components in our 
scheme, and they greatly facilitate our cooperation with 
international financial institutions and foreign investors. If 
we refuse entry to greenfield projects and welcome only 
investors interested in bringing their capital to our 
privatization projects, we will build a trap for ourselves and 
discourage much Western capital from coming here. Because these 
are firms that operate on the principle of starting from 
scratch, we spend tremendous sums of money on getting foreign 
investors interested in Poland, and this is beginning to bring 
results. Foreign capital investors have already invested more 
than $3 billion. The Germans, for example, were quite upset to 
learn that they are only in fifth place as regards the amount of 
capital invested. They have been left behind by the Americans, 
the multinational capital, the Italians, and the Dutch.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Bender, chairman of the chamber of </F>
deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, by an 
unidentified correspondent; date and place not given -- from the 
"U Potrazi" program] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Our guest tonight is Ivan Bender, 
chairman of the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna's parliament. 
  Why was the parliament of the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina not in session last week, between 28 and 30 
April as announced ? 
  [Bender] We had several discussions with the Muslim side and 
we agreed that the constituent assembly should take place at the 
end of April. However, the Muslim side did not respect the 
agreement and the assembly did not take place because there was 
nothing to discuss. We should begin implementing the agreement 
in principle -- the selection of cadres and demarcation on the 
ground -- and we should adopt the constitution. 
  [Correspondent] There are two problems regarding the 
selection of cadres: Things seem to be stuck in connection with 
the posts of the president of the federation and the prime 
minister. 
  [Bender] This is a problem because the Muslim side wants to 
keep both the post of the president of the federation and the 
post of the premier. This is not logical and we have made our 
standpoints clear through the presidency of the Croatian 
Democratic Union [HDZ] and the presidential council of 
Herceg-Bosna. We cannot change this and there is no reason why 
we should. One of the top posts must be given to the Croats. 
In this case it is a priority, having in mind that Alija 
Izetbegovic has been the president of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina for four years now. If we want to have some 
kind of continuity as we have said earlier then it is logical 
that the Croats should have 50 percent of the posts in the 
Federation in the forthcoming period. 
  [Correspondent] What do you have to say about Alija 
Izetbegovic's appeal to President Tudjman, urging the 
implementation of the Washington agreement, if you think that 
the Muslim side does not want to implement the initial steps as 
far as the constitution is concerned. 
  [Bender] I believe that it is an attempt to relegate 
responsibility from the Muslim side to us Croats. I believe 
that the world will find it easy to see through this attempt. 
At our last meeting in Sarajevo, which was attended by Mr. 
Silajdzic with his team and by us from Herceg-Bosna it was 
obvious... [pauses] The U.S. envoy was present there as well as 
the Croatian ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina. They attended 
the meeting and they could see for themselves. We gave our 
proposals and an alternative while the Muslims did not. 
  [Bender] Consequently, one can see -- I can state in clear 
terms -- that the Muslims are not interested in implementing the 
agreement. If they were interested they would take steps, as it 
is their turn now. We agreed that they should convene the next 
meeting of our working groups so we can embark on the next round 
of talks. 
  [Correspondent] Why should they do it? 
  [Bender] Because it was we who requested and organized both 
meetings. It is Silajdzic's turn, that is, his team and Alija 
Izetbegovic. We expect, we are willing, to continue talks 
wherever and whenever. But these talks should be within the 
framework of the constitution and the agreement. By no means 
can we go beyond this. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Bender, both you and President Zubak as 
well as the chairman of the executive board of the Croatian 
Democratic Community, Markovic, frequently stress that you are 
not going to tolerate a situation in which Croat cadres in the 
federation are appointed by someone else. What are you referring 
to, precisely? 
  [Bender] I believe that everyone is aware that the HDZ is 
the 
only legal and legitimate representative of the Croats in the 
area of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna. It is logical then that all the rights to elect 
and appoint cadres to any position and represent the Croats are 
vested in the HDZ. 
  [Correspondent] Who does want to manage cadres instead of 
the 
HDZ? Tell us explicitly. 
  [Bender] There are attempts by those people in the so-called 
HNV [Croat National Council], headed by Ivo Komsic, to 
appropriate some kind of right at their talks with Sarajevo's 
HDZ city branch. We have been present there on three occasions. 
One should listen to these people and understand what they 
think about that tiny bunch who gather there and call themselves 
representatives of the HNV. The leadership of the HDZ Sarajevo 
city branch are firmly in line with the policy of the HDZ and 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
  [Correspondent] Who supports the HNV and its policy of 
appointing cadres, as you say? 
  [Bender] In our area, I believe, no one supports them. I 
also firmly believe that the HNV's policy and that tiny bunch 
who call themselves HNV are behind everything that is going on 
in the area of our state of Croatia. 
  [Presenter] And lastly, what next? 
  [Bender] I believe that it is in the interest of both the 
Muslims and the Croats to try and implement this skeletal 
agreement, the Washington agreements and our constitution. Over 
the next few days we are going to wait and see what the other 
side does. We must make use of this period of cease-fire and 
consolidate our ranks. We must primarily improve some things in 
our army, in our police and in political life and the economy. 
Wherever it is possible, production should be revived. I 
believe that our visits, ranging from president Zubak to 
Markovic and everyone else among us who is touring the area, we 
must implement some things on the ground. [sentence as heard] We 
must return to the creation of living conditions.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 4 (TANJUG) -- The Croat side in the 
ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BIH) renounces a 
Moslem demand that Moslems should hold the offices of president 
and prime minister of a future Moslem-Croat federation, it was 
stated Wednesday by Kresimir Zubak, leader of the Croatian 
community in the BIH. Zubak, in a statement to the Croatian 
radio which calls him "president of the presidential council of 
the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna (HRHB)," asserts that the 
"process of establishing a federation has been delayed by the 
Bosnian Moslem side which even tries to accuse Croat 
representatives for buying time." 
  Said Zubak, "the Bosnian Moslem representatives now seek 
that 
Moslems should be both president and prime minister of the 
federation, for what there are no grounds in the constitution, 
and this demand would not be accepted by the Croatian side." 
  An agreement on a Croat-Moslem federation in the BIH, and on 
the later entry of this joint state into a confederal union with 
the neighbouring Croatia, was signed, under strong U.S. 
pressure, in Washington early March. It ended fierce clashes 
between Bosnian Moslems and Croats for territories which had 
lasted since the beginning of last year. Zubak said he did not 
know when the talks on a Moslem-Croat federation would continue 
because no invitations were as yet coming in from Sarajevo. He 
recalled that Bosnian Croat representatives had so far gone to 
Sarajevo three times for talks, never reaching accord on leaders 
of a future federation. 
  The Moslem Radio Sarajevo reported that opposition parties 
in 
the Republic of Croatia had begun to wonder why Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman was now shelving off for a second time 
his official visit to Sarajevo. The Radio quoted Dobrosav 
Paraga, leader of the extreme rightist "Croatian Party of Right" 
(HSP), as telling a news conference in Zagreb Wednesday that 
Tudjman was delaying his visit to Sarajevo "simply because he 
does not want the Washington agreement on a Moslem-Croat 
federation to be implemented." Paraga asserted that Tudjman 
"does not want either the enforcement of the Washington accord 
or the renouncement of Herzeg-Bosna as it is termed." Paraga 
did not believe in any technical problems around Tudjman's 
visit. He did not accept an assertion that "the U.N. Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) does not want to secure the Croatian 
president's travel to Sarajevo," the Moslem radio said. The 
radio added that what Paraga said was the first public statement 
on the Croatian political scene concerning Tudjman's deliberate 
delay of his visit to Sarajevo because of being insincere to the 
Washington agreement. 
  Unlike Tudjman, Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic was quoted 
by 
the HSP as sincerely wanting the implementation of the 
agreement, and this was why he invited Tudjman to Sarajevo again 
-- said the Moslem Radio Sarajevo in its report from Zagreb.

  [Text] Prompted by the increasingly frequent incidents on 
the part of the Jablanica-Prozor road, which is under the 
control of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], particularly by 
the brutal attack on women and older Bosniak men that occurred 
on 2 May, the Executive Council of the Party of Democratic 
Action [SDA] for Jablanica has issued a statement. Fazlo 
Dervisbegovic reports on the details. 
  [Begin Dervisbegovic recording] It is obvious that the 
responsible civilian and military bodies of the Prozor commune 
are either incapable or unwilling to implement the agreement 
negotiated and signed by the highest representatives of the 
Bosniak-Muslim and Croatian peoples. The Jablanica SDA 
Executive Council is appealing to the citizens of the Jablanica 
commune and the surrounding area to refrain from going for 
supplies to the area of the Prozor commune. Second, we demand -- 
the statement of the SDA Executive Council reads -- that all the 
state bodies in the Jablanica commune -- the civilian 
authorities, military structures, and police stations -- put 
their maximum effort into preventing and eliminating all forms 
of black marketeering and other criminal activities in the area 
of the Jablanica commune. Third, we suggest that the 
appropriate civilian authorities and other structures 
indefinitely suspend the issuing of permits for trips to the 
area of the Jablanica commune, and fourth, we condemn the UN 
Protection Force's very passive attitude to the events in Prozor 
on 2 May 1994, when our fellow citizens sought their protection. 
  With the aim of shedding light on these events and their 
background, the Jablanica SDA Executive Council wishes to inform 
the general public, the appropriate republican institutions, and 
the [word indistinct] of the SDA of Bosnia-Herzegovina, reads 
the statement of the Jablanica SDA Executive Council. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] Several rounds of barrage fire from an 
anti-aircraft machinegun landed on the central parts of the town 
last night. The chetniks were frequently firing provocatively 
with small arms at the defense lines on the left bank of the 
Drina River. They also fired grenades. The outskirts of the 
free territory were shelled occasionally. 
  Somewhat more intensive shelling by the aggressor's 
artillery 
took place on the sector of the front toward Foca and Pale. The 
situation on the right bank of the Drina River has not changed 
since the arrival of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. The 
chetniks are still in the same positions. The looting has more 
or less been completed. UNPROFOR units are still without 
precise orders and authority. Two UN helicopters landed in 
Gorazde this morning. After a brief stop they left toward 
Sarajevo. It is said unofficially that General Rose paid a 
visit to the members of the peacekeeping units.

  [Text] Zagreb, May 5 (AFP) -- A British UN convoy blocked 
since Saturday by Bosnian Serb forces finally arrived in the 
Moslem enclave of Gorazde early Thursday after the Serbs gave a 
go-ahead, a UN forces spokesman here said. The 51-vehicle 
convoy carrying 168 UN peackeepers entered the enclave around 
0115 (2315 GMT), said UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman 
Yvon Desjardins. The British company will reinforce some 500 UN 
troops already controlling the NATO exclusion zone and ceasefire 
around the hard- hit enclave. 
  It left Sarajevo Saturday but was stopped at a Serb 
checkpoint in Rogatica, only 35 kilometers (21 miles) east of 
the Bosnian capital by Serbs objecting to what they said was 
excess weapons and cameras. UNPROFOR said Wednesday in Sarajevo 
it had been forced to bow to Serb demands to remove some of the 
ammunition and cameras from the convoy.

  [Excerpt] The joint aggressors have not stopped attacking 
the Bihac region. Karadzic's chetniks last night stepped up 
artillery attacks on the defenders of the Grabez part of the 
front and the Ggrmusko-Srbljanski plateau. They also started 
shelling the suburbs and central part of Cazin at 2300. They 
fired some 20 mortar and howitzer shells. 
  There was also some shelling on the Bosanska Krupa and Buzim 
front. Anti-aircraft weapons and heavy machine guns are being 
used constantly. The paramilitary formations of the Kladusa 
traitors and rebels have stepped attacks last night and this 
morning. They are attacking Trzac, Liskovac, Krivaja, and 
Pecigrad in the Cazin commune, and Todorovo and Varoska Rijeka 
with 82 mm and 120 mm mortars and guns. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Pool item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, May 4 (TANJUG) -- The vice-president of 
the Yugoslav Chamber of Republics Radmilo Bogdanovic said 
Wednesday that a possible attack on Brcko (northern Bosnia) 
would be an aggression because Brcko was a free Serb town in 
which people lead normal lives with a functioning state and 
economy. In a statement to TANJUG Bogdanovic warned that Brcko 
was a "fabricated Gorazde" aimed at cutting off the corridor 
between the Serb lands and linking the newly-formed Moslem-Croat 
Federation with Croatia in the north. 
  In the last few days the Moslem Army has been concentrating 
its forces in the Brcko area to attack the town and cut off the 
corridor which links the eastern and western parts of the 
Bosnian Serb Republic. This was openly admitted Monday by the 
commander of the Moslem Army Rasim Delic who said that Brcko was 
the "key to the Bosnian war". Despite this statement many 
Western media, who had formerly showered the world with untruths 
about the destruction of the Moslem enclave of Gorazde (eastern 
Bosnia) and the number of civilians killed there, are now 
fabricating similar untruths about the Serbs massing forces to 
attack Brcko, as if the town was not in their control. At the 
same time, it is insisted, particularily in U.S. Adminsitration 
circles, that NATO should carry out air strikes on the Serbs if 
they go into action. 
  After all the mistakes the international community has 
admitted to having made and after so many victims and 
destruction, the world should realize that the war which has 
been stirred up in the former Yugoslavia and in the Balkans is 
in nobody's interest, Bogdanovic averted. Bosnian Serb 
President Radovan Karadzic said Tuesday in his talks with 
Special U.N. Envoy Yasushi Akashi that the Serb side was 
offering a ceasefire in the Brcko region and that it would be 
implemented unilaterally even if it is not accepted by the 
Moslems. 
  Karadzic also agreed to the deployment of U.N. observers on 
the Serb and Moslem sides in the area to prevent an escalation 
of the crisis.

  [Text] The ambassador of yet another country -- Germany's 
Johannes Preisinger -- today presented his credentials to 
President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic. Senada Cumurovic 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] Upon receiving the 
credentials of Dr. Johannes Preisinger, German ambassador to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Izetbegovic said: 
  [Izetbegovic] In you, as an individual, we greet all the 
German citizens who, through numerous manifestations of a moral 
and political nature, supported our struggle for freedom, and 
who, through various types of help extended to our people, stood 
steadfastly by us. In addition to this, with this act, the 
Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has once again 
proven its indisputable support of our independence and 
sovereignty. Your country was among the first to recognize us 
and, in addition to this, before the Serbian and Montenegrin 
attack, Germany had a clear position and an authentic vision of 
the tragic developments if the aggression was not prevented by 
all the means available to the international community. The 
Federal Republic of Germany is currently a second home to 
350,000 citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Your country has 
provided shelter to the greatest number of refugees and expelled 
Bosnians. It is not only numbers that speak of the generosity 
of the German authorities toward our citizens, but also the way 
in which our people have been received throughout your country. 
The economic and legal status of our refugees has been 
optimally regulated in Germany until conditions are established 
for their safe return. All this testifies to the fact that 
Germany is not only great in an economic and political sense, 
but it means that your country is also great in respect to its 
choice of social aims. Please convey our gratitude and respect 
to the president of the republic, Mr. Richard von Weizsaecker, 
Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bundestag Chairman Rita 
Suessmuth, and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Ambassador 
Preisinger, I welcome you to our country and wish you great 
success in your mission. 
  [Cumurovic] Dr. Johannes Preisinger is the 12th ambassador 
in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina that has presented his credentials. [end

Bonn prior to news of the gunshots, German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel described the despatch of the ambassador as "a 
further signal of our efforts to bring peace and stability to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina". An important aspect of the German 
embassy's work in Sarajevo will be the coordination of public 
and private humanitarian aid from Germany for the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kinkel said. The government of Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl has also said it wants to help reconstruction work 
here as the war ends.

<F P=106> [Report on a statement by Alija Izetbegovic, president of </F>
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, in Sarajevo on 4 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] In the past 10 days, President of the Presidency 
Alija Izetbegovic has twice toured the Bosnia-Herzegovina free 
territories. Upon his return to Sarajevo, President Izetbegovic 
gave a statement to Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Izetbegovic] I have made two visits: Last week I visited 
for four days. This was primarily a visit to the army, and I 
did not make any civilian tours. I thought that after Gorazde, 
I ought to tour the fronts, so I went to (?Niksici), the front 
near (?Niksici), for the first time. After that I toured the 
front in Olovo, and then went on to Tesanj and Maglaj. On the 
second occasion -- after I returned -- [words indistinct] three 
days, I visited the Kladanj front, which is a very important and 
hot front. Then I visited the Brcko front, which has recently 
been frequently mentioned as the probable scene of a future 
offensive, a massive Serb offensive, and finally, yesterday I 
visited Mt. Vlasic, the Mt. Vlasic front. [Words indistinct] on 
the hills themselves, on the 1,700-meter and [word indistinct] 
high peaks. So, if I were to talk about my impressions, I could 
say that on the one hand, the morale of the troops is extremely 
high, considering the circumstances under which the people are 
fighting. My aim was actually to [words indistinct] under which 
our units up there are living, because I had been informed that 
there were great problems with food, accommodation, clothing, 
ammunition, and so forth. Such problems do exist, but my 
conclusion -- after analyzing the situation in the General 
Staff, as we did late last night -- is that the problems can be 
solved and we shall begin solving them immediately. Some of the 
issues we have already solved. Actually, the problem of caring 
for the families of our troops needs to be solved in a definite 
and systematic way [words indistinct]. We need to solve the 
problem of nutrition [words indistinct] of our troops. This 
problem has so far been more or less solved in a satisfactory 
way. It is only lately that certain problems have arisen. 
After the subject was broached and it was discussed whether 
this was the obligation of the commune or the Defense Ministry. 
[sentence as heard] Then we have the issue of attire -- 
clothing and footwear. I believe that we shall soon solve these 
issues in a satisfactory way, that is, in the conditions under 
which are troops are fighting. I met many of them, I personally 
listened to them, I saw what they were being fed, and I visited 
their sleeping quarters -- I believe, for example, that those on 
Mt. Vlasic are cold in the night, and so forth. Therefore, 
these problems do exist but we will solve them.

<F P=106> [Article by Mario Marusic: "The Serbs Are Advancing"] </F>
  [Text] Mostar (from VJESNIK's staff correspondent) -- The 
situation regarding the destroyed town of Gorazde and the Serbs' 
(non)withdrawal is still vague (because of another example of 
the international factors agreeing to play the Serbs' game), 
but, on the other hand, it is increasingly certain that the 
Bosnian Serbs -- even if they forego further attacks on Gorazde 
-- do not intend to give up further conquests of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to "annex" it to the "republic of 
Srpska." The concentration of Serbian forces around Gorazde -- 
from the territory of the "FRY" alone, 60 tanks and 80 trucks 
packed with soldiers came over to Bosnia-Herzegovina -- was, 
unfortunately, just a drop in the ocean considering the scope of 
last week's Serbian military operations in the area of Brcko, 
Orasje, and Usora, and, especially surprising (after so many 
months of cease-fire), on the Mostar-Stolac front lines. 
  The main brunt of their assault is to be expected in the 
area 
of Orasje and [Bosanski] Samac, where the Serbs are constantly 
applying pressure to expand the corridor (which in its present 
state cannot guarantee unobstructed passage and connections 
between "the Serbian lands" to their liking). Eighty tanks that 
have recently been stationed in Bijeljina (brought from Valjevo 
and Zajecar) and the presence of a great number of commandos 
from Nis, provide enough "guarantee" of the seriousness of 
Serbian intent and inevitability of a new battle for [Bosanska] 
Posavina. Furthermore, the Serbs even have the nerve to 
threaten towns on the left bank of the Sava -- Slavonski Brod 
and Zupanja -- trying to provoke new conflicts in Croatia as 
well. 
  That the Serbs do not consider this war over, although they 
control two-thirds of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory, is evident 
from the concentration of forces of the Eastern Herzegovinian 
Corps (some of whose units are also fighting in Gorazde) and 
additional units of "volunteers" and the regular Yugoslav Army 
in the Neretva valley, around Stolac and Mostar. Thus, long 
since stated Serbian desires to gain access to the sea and to 
the left bank of the Neretva are again in focus. Daily 
provocations along the demarcation lines, which sometimes grow 
into serious attacks, support this thesis. Those attacks became 
the daily practice after the signing of the Washington Agreement 
and they have recently escalated, causing panic among Muslims on 
the left bank of the Neretva. 
  Naturally, the units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats are 
prepared to fight back and repel the possible Serbian offensive, 
that is, to defend Mostar and Stolac, if the Serbs threaten the 
territory under their control, but the Muslim side should be 
aware of this and change some of its views regarding the 
Washington Agreement (General Arif Pasalic in Mostar is one of 
the biggest obstacles to the normalization of relations) if it 
really wants to form the federation, which, among other things, 
would also have a joint defense against Serbian aggression.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivo Komsic, leader of the Croatian Peasants' </F>
Party for Bosnia-Herzegovina and member of the B-H Presidency, 
by Ankica Posavljak; place and date not given: "Before the HNV, 
We Were Fighting Against the Muslims"] 
  [Text] In Sarajevo delegations of the Croatian republic 
of Herzeg-Bosna and of the Bosniak-Muslims side have been 
discussing the appointments to official posts of the Federation 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the question of who will be 
president has remained unanswered, despite the fact that the 
Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (that was 
adopted on 30 March in Sarajevo) stipulates that president ought 
to be appointed within 30 days of the adoption of the 
Constitution. Time is running out, but the Croats and 
Muslims-Bosniaks have not yet been able to agree on which people 
the president will be chosen from. Even if they eventually 
agree that the future president should be a Croat, the question 
remains who will be the president, since the Croatian People's 
Council [HNV], which was founded in mid-February this year in 
Sarajevo, although objecting to being referred to as a political 
party, still has political aspirations regarding the future head 
of state. Furthermore, 10 days ago the HNV put forward Ivo 
Komsic, chairman of the Croatian Peasants' Party [HSS] for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a presidential candidate. This was an 
occasion to talk with Komsic. 
  [Posavljak] Unlike your regularly participation in all the 
negotiations between the Herzegovina Croats and Muslims, always 
as a member of the Bosniak delegation, you were not present at 
the latest round of talks? 
  [Komsic] It was about an agreement between the two 
governments on economic and humanitarian matters, and I am a 
member of the Presidency, rather than a minister in the 
government. Also, it was a meeting of two parliamentary 
parties: The Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] and the Party 
of Democratic Action [SDA], to which I do not belong. I do not 
know what kind of agreement they will reach, but regardless of 
what they agree, it is necessary to carry out talks with other 
parties in the Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, because not a 
single deputies' club in the Parliament is homogeneous. Also, 
one has to reconcile attitudes within the Croatian deputies' 
club, and within the Muslim-Bosniak deputies' club, because both 
of them are heterogeneous. They are composed of parties with 
different orientations. 
  [Posavljak] You said that the latest round of talks was 
about an agreement between two parliamentary parties, whose 
legitimacy had been confirmed by the elections back in 1990. It 
is obvious that the SDA and the Muslim-Bosniak leadership are 
making agreements with their partner in power, namely the HDZ. 
Your HSS is not taken into consideration, is it? 
  [Komsic] To put forward such arguments is to try to revive 
the old argument about which party is legitimate, and which has 
a right to represent the interests of the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We feel that such a debate is superfluous, 
all the more so since the war has changed many things in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and many parties have squandered their 
legitimacy and legality. The parties may discuss issues and 
reach agreements, but all the agreements must be reached within 
their deputies' clubs, while there is also the highest authority 
-- the constituent assembly, where decisions are made by a 
two-thirds majority. Proposals that are passed in the clubs do 
not necessarily have to pass in the assembly. 
  [Posavljak] The HSS was founded as late as last year, so it 
could not take part in the 1990 elections, but now it is 
competing for power. 
  [Komsic] When a party was founded is not important at all. 
The HSS revived its activities in Bosnia last year, and nobody 
can deny any party's right to put forward its candidates. The 
HSS is to be given considerable credit for the accomplishment of 
peace in Bosnia, even for the achievement of the Washington 
Agreement and the institution of the constituent assembly of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Contribution to peace is the only measure by 
which the legitimacy of any political party can be measured. 
The time has come for the position of certain parties to be 
determined by evaluating their contribution to peace. The HSS 
has its deputies' club in the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and I have to say that a number of HDZ deputies support the work 
of the HSS. 
  [Posavljak] Who are those deputies? 
  [Komsic] I do not want to mention names, but I will 
corroborate my assertion by saying that a member of the HNV and 
HSS won the support of a majority of HDZ deputies when the 
chairman of the Croatian deputies' club was being elected at a 
previous constituent assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Posavljak] You are promoting the HNV and its candidates 
although you claim that the HNV is not a political party. What 
is it then? Is it an association of citizens, and can it be 
taken as a serious political party as such? 
<H5>  Rift Among Croats </H5>
  [Komsic] The HNV is an executive body of the Croatian 
National Assembly that took place in Sarajevo on 6 February this 
year. That body is struggling for the implementation of the 
conclusions adopted at the convention, which are absolutely in 
accord with the Washington Agreement and the Constitution of the 
Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and will struggle for it until 
everything that has been agreed upon or planned is implemented. 
  [Posavljak] Did the foundation of the HNV cause a division 
into loyal and disloyal Croats, that is, to what extent have you 
contributed to the disintegration of the unity of the Croats at 
a time when intensive homogenization of the other two peoples in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is taking place? 
  [Komsic] If we value the collective interest of the Croats 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is for peace, I suppose, then there 
is no need to campaign against the HNV and the people who have 
brought about peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Before the 
foundation of the HNV and its concept of federation, we had a 
war between the Croats and the Muslims. The theory about a rift 
among the Croats is sustained by those who are struggling for 
power, by those who tried to create a national state for 
themselves in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and who cannot reconcile 
themselves to their political defeat. The new Constitution 
represents their defeat, and now those forces want to achieve 
power again in order to protect their own interests. As for the 
Croatian nation here in Bosnia-Herzegovina, those who 
disintegrated the Croats, who sacrificed half a million Croats 
for the creation of a Croatian national state in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, are now trying to push their policy through 
the institutions of the Federation. They are trying to revive 
and deepen the rift that they themselves caused among the the 
Croats by campaigning against the HNV. 
  [Posavljak] You keep saying that the HNV has brought about 
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that your policy brought about 
the Washington Agreement as well. However, the representatives 
of the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna claim the same for 
themselves, and it is they who signed the document. Who is to 
be given credit for the accomplishment of the peace agreement 
between the Croats and Muslim-Bosniaks? 
  [Komsic] Representatives of the Croatian republic of 
Herzeg-Bosna stated their attitude at the assembly in Livno, and 
according to the Livno resolution the Croatian people claims 
sovereignty and statehood in Herzeg-Bosna, while all other 
Croats would be protected by international institutions for 
human rights and freedoms. That means that their resolution 
declared us to be a national minority in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but 
this concept of theirs as stated in the Livno resolution 
ultimately failed. 
  [Posavljak] In view of your attitude that it is precisely 
the HVN that has preserved the Croats' equality as a nation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, how do you interpret certain denunciations 
on the part of certain groups among the Croatian people, saying 
that you are a Croatian Sejdo Bajramovic [the Albanian member of 
the Yugoslav Federal Presidency before the war] 
  [Komsic] I can only say that history will answer many 
questions. 
<H5>  In Politics -- Out of Necessity </H5>
  [Posavljak] The HNV has already announced its criteria that 
the candidates for federal posts should meet. One of those 
criteria is that none of the candidates should ever have been 
involved in the Croatian-Muslim war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Are 
there any such people among the current politicians at all? I 
refer thereby also to you and to Stjepan Kljujic, member of the 
Bosnian Presidency, because the Croats in central Bosnia 
consider you to be indirect participants in the conflict, but on 
the Muslim side? 
  [Komsic] Those are insinuations, and in proposing these 
criteria we referred to the people who were actively involved in 
the conflict either as protagonists, or through the media, 
generating hatred between the two peoples. 
  [Posavljak] Are your attitudes and explanations supported 
by the Croats in central Bosnia, where you yourself come from, 
and would you dare visit your native town of Kiseljak now, 
convinced of the correctness of your policy? 
  [Komsic] An unpredictable danger in such places not only for 
me, but also for other people, lies in uniformed groups or 
individuals who have broken loose from any control. Those who 
are under the control of or subordinated to the General Staff of 
the Croatian Defense Council represent no danger for any of us, 
which means for me as well. I travelled enough during the war 
throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I stayed in Grude, Citluk, 
and Capljina without any fear. 
  [Posavljak] You also said that the HNV put the blame for the 
conflict on those who had generated hatred between the peoples 
by waging a media war. One of the elements of the Washington 
Agreement stipulates the urgent cessation of the media war. 
While listening to Sarajevo Radio these days I have noticed 
that the Croats are still referred to as Ustashas. Do you feel 
uncomfortable when you hear that the official, state-run media 
refer to your people in such a way? 
  [Komsic] I have already made many public statements about 
the terminology used, which is quite unbecoming to the media. 
After all, the Ustasha movement was never in conflict with the 
Muslims, and never supported the partition of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, because of the fascist connotation that 
the term conveys, we disagree with the use of it. It is 
incorrect rather than offensive. 
  [Posavljak] What will happen to your political career if the 
HDZ and the SDA reach an agreement? Do you see any political 
future for yourself if Herzeg-Bosna's candidate becomes 
president? 
  [Komsic] My engagement in politics has resulted from 
necessity, from the need for the protection of Croatian 
interests in the region. I am not worried about my political 
career because I have never aimed at one. Everything that I 
have done has been out of necessity, to save what could be 
saved, and now we want the consensus between Muslims and Croats 
to be preserved through the implementation of the Constitution. 
  [Posavljak] Still, you have not given up your candidacy for 
the future president of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Komsic] My candidacy for one of the leading offices in the 
Federation was announced by the HNV some 10 days ago, while 
other things will be determined in the course of negotiations. 
  [Posavljak] With respect to your attitude that everything 
that you are doing is for the benefit of the Croatian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, would you give up your presidential 
candidacy if the Croatian interest demanded that? 
  [Komsic] Yes, because it is all about the implementation of 
the project of Federation, and if somebody else were to 
implement it, I would be very happy.

<F P=106> [Article by Mate Basic: "Col. Dragan Vikic Against Commander </F>
Tuto Naletilic"] 
  [Text] Archbishop Vinko Puljic, his assistant Bishop Petar 
Sudar, Police Colonel Dragan Vikic, Ivo Komsic, president of the 
HNV [Croatian National council], Col. Gen. Ante Roso, and 
Kresimir Zubak, president of the Croat-Muslim Federation, are 
men with different professional and political careers in the 
past and altogether different beliefs. But they are bound 
together by an extremely important feature they have in common: 
They are the most distinguished representatives of the new 
Croatian policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, through whose conduct 
they are to confirm that Croats sincerely desire to maintain the 
state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, without at the same time 
jeopardizing the most vital Croatian national interests in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The media have been saying in recent weeks that the signing 
of the Washington agreement was an expression of the continuity 
of Croatian policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina and that there has 
been a radical departure from what until recently were the 
official views of Zagreb and Grude, which is more than clear. 
  The departure of Mate Boban, M.A., the top man in the 
Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, was symbolic of the change 
that occurred in most of the political elite of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's Croats, which until recently advocated a 
division of Bosnia-Herzegovina and strove to settle the conflict 
with the Muslims by military means. 
  The Croat-Muslim agreement also thrust into the foreground 
certain Croats who until recently were either marked as 
"traitors to the Croatian cause" or were marginalized or had 
come into politics only quite recently. 
<H5>  Kresimir Zubak, the Most Important Representative of the </H5>
Interests of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
  What we wanted above all in choosing new representatives of 
the Croatian people in Bosnia was to sketch out the new currents 
in Croatian policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Kresimir Zubak, 
who succeeds Mate Boban at the head of Herceg-Bosna Croats, is 
chairman of the presidential council of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, a candidate for president of the future 
federation, and until recently the vice president of the HVO 
[Croatian Defense Council] of Herceg-Bosna, who says that it is 
not contrary to the Croatian interest even for the Serbs to join 
the federation. He was born 29 November 1947 in Doboj. A lawyer 
by profession, he at one time held the office of president of 
the basic court in Doboj. He has also been assistant secretary 
in the B-H Secretariat for Jurisprudence and General 
Administration, and he was justice minister in the government of 
Herceg-Bosna. When the Serbs attacked Usora, where the alliance 
with the Muslims was never in question at any time, Zubak went 
from Doboj to that small Croatian enclave, where he was in fact 
wounded as an HVO fighter. Zubak, who says that creation of the 
republic of Herceg-Bosna was necessary to organize the army and 
the government, turned up as the most important representative 
of the interests of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina in negotiations 
with the Muslims about creation of the Bosnian federation. 
<H5>  Ante Roso, Ardent Catholic and Defender of the Law </H5>
  Col. Gen. Ante Roso, chief of the general staff of the 
Croatian Defense Council, is the principal Croat military 
negotiator with the Muslims, who are represented by Gen. Rasim 
Delic of the B-H Army. An extremely impressive person, informed 
people say, his approach won over even the side that was an 
adversary until recently. A 42-year-old noncommissioned officer 
in the Foreign Legion, married to a French woman and the owner 
of a private firm in France, he had retired after 21 years in 
France's most elite military unit, but at the very outset of the 
Serbian aggression against Croatia he returned to the homeland. 
Having been a fighting man in the Legion's 2d Airborne Regiment, 
in Croatia he worked first as a military instructor, and then he 
commanded special units of the Croatian Army. 
  Roso has fought on all fronts in Croatia, and he has been 
fiercely attacked in the Muslim and Serbian media because of the 
defense of Croatian towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina he organized 
(both when they were being attacked by the Serbs and when they 
were being attacked by the Muslims). An ardent Catholic, he 
headed the first Croatian military delegation to the shrine of 
Our Lady of Lourdes. 
  When Gen. Slobodan Praljak was removed from the head of the 
Croatian Defense Council, Roso went to Herceg-Bosna from the 
Croatian Army. His arrival halted the Muslim offensive in 
central Bosnia, in areas where the HVO has experienced the 
greatest defeats. At the same time the peace negotiations began 
with the Muslims. 
  Gen. Roso also enjoys confidence in Herzegovina because of 
his firm decision to organize the HVO according to strict 
military rules and to halt the lawlessness which had prevailed 
until recently in that area. 
<H5>  Zeljko Glasnovic, Legionnaire From the Gulf War </H5>
  Professional Guards brigades of the HVO are also being 
organized under the command of Gen. Roso in Orasje, Vitez, 
Tomislavgrad, and Capljina. Brig. Zeljko Glasnovic, commander of 
the Ante Bruno Busic 1st Guards Brigade, housed in the Bozan 
Simovic Garrison in Capljina, is a 40-year-old Croat who was 
born in Zagreb, but his family moved to Canada when he was 
eight. One of the best-known members of the Foreign Legion, he 
returned to the homeland in 1991 to oppose the Serbian 
aggression. He spent five years in the Canadian army, he fought 
in Central America, and in the Legion, with the rank of a 
noncommissioned sergeant -- he also fought in the Gulf war. He 
speaks several foreign languages, he is an instructor of 
infantry warfare on all terrains, and he is an expert on 
armor-piercing weapons, mountain climbing and scout training, 
and antiguerrilla warfare. Like the other Legionnaires, 
Glasnovic trained members of special military forces in 
Kumrovec, and later he advocated the English type of discipline 
and the Israeli method of waging war in the Croatian armed 
forces. 
<H5>  Dragan Vikic, Living Legend of the Bosnian Resistance </H5>
  Col. Dragan Vikic, commander of the antiterrorist unit of 
the 
B-H MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], is a Croat from 
Sarajevo, the first man who came to the defense of the capital 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina; he became distinguished in the media when 
in April 1992, wearing a camouflage uniform and holding a rifle, 
he appeared on television to appeal to the citizens to oppose 
the Serbs with weapons. Even before that, when he and his men 
captured 1,500 rifles in Gorazde which were being transported by 
truck, supposedly to the garrison in Visoko, but actually for 
chetnik units in Croatia, the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] 
decided to pursue Vikic and punish him. 
  This former Yugoslav judo champion and organizer of special 
police units in Bosnia-Herzegovina has served under three 
ministers of internal affairs during this war: Alija 
Delimustafic, who is said to have been working closely with Aca 
Vasiljevic, former chief of the JNA KOS [counterintelligence 
service], Jusuf Pusina, during whose tenure a warrant was issued 
for Delimustafic's arrest, and Bakir Alispahic, who is the 
minister at the moment. 
  Mladen "Tifa" Vojicic, who formerly was the vocalist for the 
group Belo Dugme, recorded a TV spot about Vikic, living legend 
of Bosnian resistance, at the height of the war. During the 
fiercest shelling of Sarajevo that spot echoed from loudspeakers 
in city streets in spite of the Serbian artillery from the hills. 
  As the leader of the effort to rid the city of snipers and 
the principal participant in the capture of the Holiday Inn, 
which snipers were using to kill people on the street, carried 
live over television, and a man whose entire family has spent 
the war in the Sarajevo settlement of Dobrinja, he has been the 
target of accusations not only by the Serbs, but also the Croats 
and Muslims. Because of the Muslim charges (among other things, 
they say that he was the one who allowed Bruno Stojic and Branko 
Kvesic, former security chiefs of Herceg-Bosna, to drive brand 
new all-terrain vehicles of the MUP to Herzegovina). Vikic, some 
say, is today under the command of Kemal Ademovic, who heads all 
the special police units of the B-H MUP and who was his deputy 
at the beginning of the war. In Herceg-Bosna they call Vikic an 
"Alija's Croat," and the well-informed in Herzegovina say that 
along with Sefer Halilovic he took part in the Muslim offensive 
against Dreznica, and that he was even wounded there. In spite 
of everything, today Col. Vikic is considered a promising police 
professional from the ranks of the Bosnian Croats. 
<H5>  Stjepan Siber, Future Military Attache or Pensioner </H5>
  Stjepan Siber is the most distinguished Croat in the ranks 
of 
the B-H Army. Siber is therefore hated among advocates of the 
"Herzegovina policy." At the outset of the Serbian aggression 
against Bosnia-Herzegovina, he and Jovan Divjak began to 
organize defense of the city and republic on the invitation of 
the legal authorities. This former officer of the JNA (he once 
served in Zagreb, birthplace of his son Boris, one of the stars 
of "Hit Parade of Surrealists"), and he also worked in the B-H 
Territorial Defense. From the outset of creation of the B-H Army 
to the present day Siber has supposedly been the second man in 
the B-H Army. Born in Brcko, with an apartment in the Sarajevo 
settlement of Grbavica (still under Serb occupation in a 
neighborhood predominantly inhabited by officers of the JNA), 
Siber obtained the rank of general in the B-H Army. Although 
followers of Izetbegovic's line never denied him credit for 
recruiting personnel trained in the JNA for the army that was 
being organized, Siber was not given a chance to break through 
to the top position in the Bosnian army (Jovan Divjak, Sefer 
Halilovic, and Rasim Delic succeeded one another in that post at 
the time). At the time of the conflict between the HVO and the 
B-H Army, the commanders of the HVO refused to negotiate with 
him: One reason was that he was "second-in-command," and the 
other that he was a Croat fighting on the side of the Muslims. 
Back when Rusmir Mahmutcehajic called for Muslims to withdraw 
from the HVO, Siber opposed him, asking whether that meant he 
also, as a Croat, should leave the B-H Army! 
  Well-informed people have two thoughts about Siber's future: 
Some say he will have the role of a military attache abroad, and 
others feel that he has a pension waiting for him. 
<H5>  Dr. Ivo Komsic, Integralist of Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>
  Dr. Ivo Komsic, like Siber (in the army) and Vikic (in the 
police), is numbered among the integralists of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This Croat from Kiseljak, full professor in 
the School of Political Science at Sarajevo University, was once 
executive secretary of the Central Committee of the League of 
Communists of Bosnia-Herzegovina. During the election Komsic 
emerged as vice president of the SDP [Socialist Democratic 
Party], which was headed by Nijaz Durakovic. Komsic later 
founded the Croatian Peasant Party [HSS] of B-H. He established 
himself as an opponent of the policy of the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Union] and the Herzegovina current, and, like the 
other Croats of Sarajevo -- whose most distinguished 
representative was Stjepan Kljuic -- he came to be referred to 
as an "Alija's Croat." This man, who is today chairman of the 
Croatian National Council and a member of the B-H Presidency, 
reached the pinnacle of politics in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the 
time of the preliminary negotiations concerning the Croat-Muslim 
agreement, says himself that "all the illegal institutions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina that have sprung up during this war are 
ceasing to exist, and there exists only the integral Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
<H5>  Vinko Puljic and Petar Sudar, Those Who Deserve the Most </H5>
Credit for the New Direction of Croatian Policy in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
  As far as church circles are concerned, many people believe 
that Monsignor Vinko Puljic, archbishop of Sarajevo, and Petar 
Sudar, his assistant, deserve the most credit for the new 
direction of Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Sudar was 
born in Neretvica, and he took his doctorate in theology in the 
Vatican. 
  Like Franjo Topic, president of the Croatian cultural 
society 
Napredak [Progress], Sudar's political commitment can best be 
seen through the work of that institution, which represents the 
typical "Sarajevo-Croatian view" towards resolution of the 
crisis of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Critics of Puljic's and Sudar's 
policy will say that their views of the nationality question is 
most evident in the activity of their Radio Station Vrhbosna, 
which at the beginning of the war was carrying the reports of 
Croatian Radio, and then, when the Croat-Muslim conflicts broke 
out, it suddenly renounced them. 
  Monsignor Vinko Puljic, archbishop of Sarajevo, head of one 
of the six Catholic archepiscopates on Croatian territory, is an 
outspoken advocate of integralism in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Puljic 
once said: ``The Serbs are backed by the Russians, the French, 
the English, and to some extent the Chinese; the Muslims are 
backed by the Islamic countries and the United States; but we 
Croats are backed only by the Holy [passage illegible] in 1945, 
as the 12th of 15 children in the family, in Prijecani, which is 
near Banja Luka. In 1961 he arrived at the Boys' Seminary on 
Salata in Zagreb. He studied theology in Djakovo, where in 1970 
he took orders to become a priest. He spent three years at this 
first pastoral post in Banja Luka. He spent five years (1973-78) 
in Ravska, which is near the Ljubija Mine, and then he was 
transferred to the post of priest in the Boys' Seminary in 
Zadar, where he remained for the next 10 years. In that year, 
1988, he was appointed parish priest in Nova Gradiska, and in 
1990 he became vice rector of the Sarajevo Seminary. In January 
1991 he succeeded Monsignor Ciril Kos in the post of archbishop 
of Sarajevo.

  [Text] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- Serb President Slobodan 
Milosevic has received Douglas Hogg, the minister of state in 
the British Foreign Office, who arrived in our country today. 
  President Milosevic said there was no real chance of the 
international community playing a positive role in the Yugoslav 
crisis as long as it failed to face the truth, as long as it 
accused Serbia of the aggression, as long as it fueled 
fundamentalism, and as long as it continued sanctions against 
the Serbian people in flagrant contravention of the UN Charter. 
By accepting the EU's proposals, the Serbian side has 
demonstrated its commitment to peace. It has transpired that 
the war is being waged by those forces that instigate the Muslim 
side into armed conflicts, something that is undoubtedly to 
their detriment and claims a large number of casualties. It is 
obvious that the policy of pressures and threats has resulted in 
total fiasco and that a peace process, whereby all warring 
parties are treated equally and the international community is 
impartial, is the quickest way to peace, a normalization of the 
situation, and a just political solution to the crisis. 
  President Slobodan Milosevic pointed out that the 
continuation of economic sanctions against our country was 
counterproductive, as they represent an obstacle to the 
restoration of peace. This is why the international community 
ought to abolish them. 
  It was stressed during the talks that the international 
community should exert strong influence to discourage and thwart 
the proponents of the war option and that it should be decisive 
in stopping Muslim armed provocations and offensives against the 
Serbs side to stop the war from escalating and to prevent 
further destablization in the region. 
  Serbia favors an agreement on a permanent end to hostilities 
on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina through an 
unbiased involvement of the UN peace forces. For this reason, 
the efforts to restart the negotiationg process are the 
international community's priority task. The republic of Serbia 
will continue to favor negotiations as a way of resolving the 
crisis and will insist that the peace process cannot be 
developed through the use of force but rather through equal 
respect for the interests of all three sides. 
  The Yugoslav minister of foreign affairs, Vladislav 
Jovanovic, also took part in the talks.

  [Text] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- We are ready to 
cooperate with the contact group and to negotiate on a political 
solution, but we will not attend a new conference on Bosnia 
unless the sanctions are lifted; that is, we cannot accept 
negotiations under unequal conditions, Radovan Karadzic, the 
president of the republic of Srpska, told TANJUG today after his 
meeting with Douglas Hogg, minister of state at the British 
foreign office in Belgrade. 
  The international community must say clearly whether it 
considers it more important to restore peace or to keep the 
sanctions in place, Karadzic said. If it is more important to 
the international community to keep the sanctions, then their 
main aim is to exhaust the Serbs economically, militarily, and 
politically, and not to restore peace. 
  The talks, which lasted about one and a half hours at the 
British residence [in Belgrade], were also attended by republic 
of Srpska vice president Nikola Koljevic, assembly chairman 
Momcilo Krajisnik, and Bosnian Serb foreign minister Aleksa 
Buha. According to Karadzic, they discussed the possibilities 
of reaching an agreement on a cessation of hostilities and an 
overall political settlement, as well as on the current 
situation in Gorazde and Brcko. 
  Karadzic said that the Serb side was ready to cooperate with 
the contact group if the group was preparing a new conference on 
Bosnia, adding that he would have a meeting with them tomorrow, 
but he expressed doubt as to whether the group had enough 
authority and could adopt a more flexible stance. Asked if 
there was a fresh approach to the conference, Karadzic said that 
the new joint standpoint of the international community was 
still undefined. If one listens to Kinkel, one could see that 
the international community, above all the European states, are 
not united regarding the solution to the Yugoslav crisis, 
Karadzic said. 
  The international community, as Karadzic said, has to 
abandon 
the concept of defining the territories by percentages. 
Percentages are meaningless. We are prepared to give five 
percent of the [Bosnian] territory for the urban core of 
Sarajevo, which amounts to half a percent. That is why we 
propose talks on the viability of two new states, Karadzic 
pointed out. 
  He reiterated that the Serbs wanted their state and that in 
the name of peace they were prepared to make such a territorial 
deal that would ensure the viability, i.e. the economic and 
military defensive capacity of their own [Bosnian Serb] state's 
borders as well as the borders of the Muslim-Croat federation. 
According to Karadzic, the issue that is unacceptable to the 
Serb side is bringing the Serb corridor, i.e. Posavina [northern 
Bosnia], into question. 
  Stressing that the corridor is a vital issue for the Serbs 
because of the encirclement [Serbs in Krajina and Bosnia are 
encircled by Muslims and Croats] and defense of the borders, 
Karadzic reiterated: We will not accept any changes in Brcko's 
status but we fully accept a cessation of all hostilities and we 
have offered the Muslims a cease-fire in the Brcko area. If the 
Muslims do not accept, the Serbs will proclaim a unilateral 
cessation of hostilities and will not respond to the attacks 
except in the case if they were really endangered. UN monitors 
will be able to make their own judgements in such cases. 
  The talks with Hogg, as Karadzic said, clarified the Brcko 
situation, while it had been agreed in yesterday's talks with UN 
envoy Akashi that three to four observer teams be stationed on 
the Serb side in the vicinity of that town in order to report 
accurately to the international community on who was carrying 
out offensive operations. Asked what the objective of the 
attempts to adopt a new UN resolution on the creation of an 
exclusion zone around Brcko precisely at a time when 
preparations were under way for a new conference on Bosnia was, 
Karadzic replied: All this is aimed at exerting pressure on the 
Serbs. 
  If we correctly view the creation of an exclusion zone 
around 
Brcko, this would mean that the Muslims and Croats would have to 
withdraw their heavy guns to a distance of 20 km from that town. 
However, we have been in Brcko since the beginning of the war. 
Life is going on normally there, schools are open, stores as 
well, and the frontline is far away, Karadzic explained. 
  There is no need to create an exclusion zone around Brcko 
because the Serbs are not asking for anyone's protection, he 
added. But if someone believes that the proclamation of an 
exclusion zone would imply that the Serbs would have to leave 
Brcko, they should know that this will not happen and that we 
will defend our right in the corridor at all costs, to the last 
Serb in the republic of Srpska. 
  As far as Gorazde is concerned, Karadzic believes that the 
crisis is over but that the only sensitive issue now is the 
safety of Serbian civilians. This should be resolved through 
the presence of the Serbian police, working in close 
collaboration with and under the supervision of the United 
Nations. There will be no other Serb forces in the agreed three 
km radius, and this should also apply to the Muslims, the 
republic of Srpska president emphasized.

<F P=106> [Report by Jelena Radovanov on a news conference by </F>
Vladislav Jovanovic after talks with Douglas Hogg, minister of 
state at the British Foreign Office, in Belgrade on 4 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Radovanov] Assessing today's talks with President 
Milosevic, Douglas Hogg said that they spoke about very 
important aspects of the crisis in Bosnia and proposals to halt 
the armed clashes, as well as proposals for a peaceful solution 
to the crisis in Bosnia. We also discussed the UNPA [UN 
Protected Areas] in Croatia, Mr. Hogg said. We did not discuss 
Brcko, since our talks did not go into details. I agree with 
increasing the number of military observers in the northern part 
of Bosnia, Hogg said. I did not arrive with a concrete plan, he 
said, but I did come with two important messages. The first one 
is the vital importance of an unconditional cease-fire, and the 
other one is the recognition of the importance of an overall 
peace solution for Bosnia, to be based on the partition of the 
territory on the basis of 49 percent to 51 percent. As you 
know, this has been under discussion, Hogg said. Hogg also said 
that there would be no alleviation of the sanctions until the 
war was over and until the peace plan was implemented. 
  This is how FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic 
assessed 
the talks between Douglas Hogg and President Milosevic: 
  [Jovanovic] You see, these talks referred to the topics that 
Mr. Hogg mentioned, that is, the situation in Bosnia and the 
negotiations with Krajina, and the situation in Kosovo was also 
mentioned. We focused on the most current issues. The minister 
has already mentioned that it was the work of the contact group 
that was the most important, then the need to conclude an 
agreement on the cease-fire. We also discussed the great need 
and the common interest in negotiations for a political 
solution. We agreed that the work of the contact group was very 
important and that there was a need for an immediate cessation 
of hostilities. The political negotiations have to follow 
immediately afterwards. There was not much talk about details. 
Mr. Hogg mentioned that there was a need for a 51 percent to 49 
percent division. That is not a problem that should halt 
negotiations and the cease-fire at the moment. 
  On the other hand, we pointed to the problem of the 
sanctions 
that are an absolute problem, which are not only the generator 
of the crisis and other problems but also a main obstacle to the 
implementation of any political solution, be it for Bosnia or 
Krajina, or the Yugoslav space in general. We found the common 
ground there that it was vital to remove obstacles on one party 
to the implementation of the future political solution. 
However, we could not discuss when and how, because as the 
minister pointed out, the common stand of the Western countries 
is that for the time being -- until the peace agreement is 
reached on Bosnia-Herzegovina -- there can be no talk about the 
lifting of the sanctions. 
  However, we pointed out that the sanctions were a form of 
hostilities that relate to the entire Serbian nations, not just 
to us in Yugoslavia, and that parallel to the cessation of 
hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina it was necessary to refer to 
the need to end other forms of hostilities. The sanctions are 
one of these. The media war and the one-sided approach by the 
international community to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the Yugoslav crisis in general is another form of hostility. It 
is impossible to stop military hostilities and maintain the 
economic and propaganda pressure, as well as psychological and 
other forms of hostilities. 
  We believe that after these talks that all those who are 
interested in peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the crisis in 
Yugoslavia will better understand the need for one revised 
approach to the Bosnian and the Yugoslav crisis -- which is to 
remove the unequal treatment of the participants in the Yugoslav 
crisis, and particularly the biased approach -- that this would 
provide a quick movement forward toward peace and the 
stabilization of the entire situation in the Balkans.

  [Text] Pristina, 5 May (TANJUG) -- Douglas Hogg, minister 
of state in the UK Foreign Office, said in Pristina today that 
both the British Government and the international community are 
of the view that the issue of the rights of Albanians of Kosovo 
and Metohija will have to be resolved within the borders of 
Serbia. I wish to say that Kosovo is part of Serbia and we do 
not believe that the borders should be changed. We also think 
that there is no need for an independent state on the territory 
of Kosovo, Douglas Hogg told journalists, following his talks 
with Milos Savovic, governor [nacelnik] of the Kosovo district. 
The main tasks are to find ways of implementing the political, 
cultural, and civil rights of the Albanian community in Kosovo 
and to allow the Albanians to play a full role in political and 
administrative life, Hogg said. 
  The British minister of state continued his visit by talking 
to ethnic Albanian representatives in Pristina.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Washington, May 4 (TANJUG) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton said on Tuesday evening he wanted the warring sides in 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to return to 
the negotiating table, reach peace and establish normal peaceful 
relations. He said he also wanted such relations with Serbia 
but added that it had to be done in a correct and moral way. He 
made the statement at an annual rally at the headquarters of the 
CNN television network in Atlanta which was devoted to foreign 
policy issues. 
  Clinton declined, however, to give a straight answer to the 
question put by a Yugoslav journalist on whether the time had 
come to start treating equally all parties to the Bosnian 
conflict (Moslems, Serbs and Croats) and stop threatening the 
Serbs alone. The U.S. President said he was not inclined to the 
lifting of the U.N. sanctions against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and added, as an argument, that 
Serbia had allegedly violated the U.N. embargo on arms 
deliveries and had been arming the Bosnian Serbs. 
  Serbia sends to the Bosnian Serbs only humanitarian supplies 
which include food, medicaments and clothes, while the U.N. arms 
embargo is being violated by the he former Yugoslav Republics of 
Slovenia and Croatia, which are directly arming Bosnian Croats 
and Moslems and allowing the Islamic and some western countries 
to smuggle arms into Bosnia-Herzegovina through their 
territories. 
  Clinton said he agreed that there could be no military 
solution to the Bosnian conflict and, in corroboration of the 
view, mentioned a Serb attempt to "gain advantage" in the 
eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde. He overlooked the fact that 
Gorazde -- a U.N.-designated "safe area" which should have been 
demilitarised last spring -- had been abused by the Bosnian 
Moslems and used as a military stronghold for launching an 
offensive on Serb territories late in March. 
  When the Serb side launched a counter-attack and the Moslems 
faced a total defeat, U.S. NATO warplanes bombed Serb positions 
around the town on April 10 and 11. Clinton said that the U.S. 
was trying to use NATO's air force to protect "safe areas" but 
that the chief objective was the return to the negotiating 
table. He stressed that the U.S. did not want to get involved 
in the Bosnian war on the Moslem side either alone or through 
NATO. 
  Clinton said the U.S. Administration had conveyed to the 
Bosnian Moslem [word indistinct] that it could not expect 
support from the U.S. to change the military balance of forces 
and that a peaceful settlement was the only solution.

  [Text] Sofia, 4 May (TANJUG) -- Rados Smiljkovic, the 
ambassador of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Sofia [name 
and title as received], today lodged a protest with the 
Bulgarian Foreign Ministry in reaction to a speech delivered by 
Albanian President Sali Berisha in the Bulgarian National 
Assembly when he attacked the FRY, Serbia, and the Serbian 
people in the harshest of terms. Such an anti-Serbian attitude 
displayed by the Albanian president raises the issue of 
responsibility borne by the hosts for this verbal assault on the 
FRY in the highest institution of Bulgarian democracy, the 
protest underlines. 
  We express our deepest regret at the fact that such a 
possibility was granted to a man well known for his advocacy of 
the war option in the Balkans, a man who is voluntarily offering 
everybody -- primarily Turkey -- bases and strongholds for 
military operations against the FRY, it is said in the protest. 
  The Albanian president is disseminating lies about the 
creation of a Greater Serbia in order to conceal his own program 
for the creation of a Greater Albania, which, besides Kosmet 
[Kosovo and Metohija], would include western Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and parts of 
Montenegro. According to the protest, the most glaring untruths 
in Berisha's speech in the Bulgarian Assembly related to Kosmet, 
because, it is said, the Albanian population there neither 
numbers two million nor has their autonomy been abolished.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- As of 24 July, there 
will be no budget deficit thanks to the speed at which our 
taxation system is recovering. Such hopes are not groundless 
given the stable position of the dinar and stagnant prices, 
Dragoslav Avramovic, the governor of the National Bank of 
Yugoslavia, said today at the "TANJUG's Guest" panel. 
  Hard currency reserves have gone up by about 450 million 
German marks in the past 100-odd days. One third of this amount 
has been earmarked for the importation of necessities and what 
is missing on the market. These goods, Avramovic says, will 
arrive soon, thus changing the ratio of supply and demand. 
  "Instead of reducing the hard currency reserves we have 
registered their increase, something that confirms our belief 
that the best way has been chosen in these difficult 
circumstances. In spite of the severe embargo we are 
outmaneuvering the unprecedented and unjust sanctions by relying 
on our creativity. 
  ``There is no reason whatever to devalue the dinar. 
Production is on the rise while every issued dinar is covered 
by hard currency or goods. [passage omitted] Despite 
predictions, when sanctions are lifted, Avramovic believes, our 
position will not be untenable because we will have a great deal 
to offer to the world market -- textiles, footwear, meat, and 
all the other goods that proved successful abroad in the past. 
  ``We have done everything possible in today's circumstances 
to facilitate the country's speedy recovery. We started with a 
200 million U.S. dollar hard currency reserve with the provision 
that the National Bank of Yugoslavia could borrow 300 million 
U.S. dollars. This, in addition to the measures of fiscal 
policy and eliminating the budget deficit, will be yet another 
impetus for reviving production, public works, and suchlike." 
[passage omitted] 
  The initial successes in curbing the rate of inflation and 
our economic difficulties have already impressed the world, the 
blockade has practically been breached. These days it is 
evident that foreign reporters are constantly interested in our 
present and future moves, Avramovic said. 
  Of course, not all our problems have been solved. The key 
remains -- a strong dinar based on the recovery of the economy. 
Some things, such as development plans and others, disappeared 
from our practices in the past. Some of these institutions, 
Avramovic maintains, should be reintroduced and we should 
proceed along the conventional path. We should not fear credits 
geared to the reviving of production, particularly so if their 
price is realistic. This in itself obliterates the fear of 
increased production being stranded in an allegedly small market. 
  The National Bank governor categorically says that a large 
number of products would find their niche in the market, even in 
today's circumstances, and even more so if national income goes 
up by 100 percent in a certain period of time. ``For example, 
of the 1.5 million cars on our roads at least half of them 
should be replaced because of their age. This is enough to keep 
Zastava [automobile producer] busy for another 10 years."

  [Text] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- In his letter to UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, Milan Martic, president of the 
republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], welcomes Butrus-Ghali's 
initiative for a new international conference on the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  In his letter the RSK president writes that the war in the 
former Yugoslavia and all its horrible consequences could have 
been averted had there been more understanding and a better 
insight into the historic causes of the crisis in former 
Yugoslavia in 1990 and 1991. 
  "At that time Europe's most powerful countries unfortunately 
supported the creation of an ethnic community's state on the 
territory of other ethnic communities, so that the territories 
of the new states on the soil of the former Yugoslavia 
corresponded with the artificial states designed by Nazi Germany 
in 1941," the letter states. It also notes that "in both cases, 
old Serbian lands were incorporated into the states of Muslims 
and Croats, while the Serbs were condemned to death, 
persecution, and assimilation." 
  Martic recalls the European principles articulated by the 
Badinter arbitration commission, which told the peoples of 
former Yugoslavia that the international community would 
recognize the new states, provided they met the following 
conditions: they should have a territory, a population, and they 
should exercise legislative authority on that territory. 
  "The Republic of Croatia was recognized, including the 
territory of the republic of Serb Krajina, where Croatia does 
not exercise legislative authority; nor does this territory 
belong to the Croatian ethnic community. The population that 
used to live there was not Croatian either," Martic adds. 
  The right to self-determination, however, has not only been 
acknowledged as an exclusive right of the Serbian nation, the 
letter to the UN secretary general says. 
  These facts were ignored in 1990 and 1991, as well as later 
on in the work of the international conference on former 
Yugoslavia, which, according to Martic, resulted in the 
escalation of the war between the Serbs and the Croats, the 
Serbs and the Muslims, and later between the Muslims and the 
Croats. 
  Reminding the UN secretary general about the persecution of 
the Serbs in Croatia during World War II, when some 1,250,000 
Serbs perished, as well as about data on Serbs murdered in and 
expelled from Croatia over the past four years, Martic stressed 
he does not believe the secretary general and other officials in 
the world could afford to ignore the republic of Serb Krajina. 
  "Serb Krajina must be included in the work of the new 
international conference on former Yugoslavia, which you intend 
to organize. The republic of Serb Krajina, albeit unrecognized, 
is nevertheless a factor in international relations, and is 
subject to international law. On 29 March this year it signed 
an agreement with the Republic of Croatia and was thus 
recognized as a warring side. It has the full right to take 
part in agreements on setting up future relations between the 
new states created on the territory of former Yugoslavia," RSK 
president Milan Martic concludes in his letter to Butrus-Ghali.

  [Text] Knin, May 4 (TANJUG) -- Senior military official of 
the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) General Mile 
Novakovic warned on Wednesday that patrols and reconnaissance 
groups of the Croatian Army in the area of Northern Dalmatia 
("Sector South") occasionally entered the buffer zone and so 
violated an agreement between the R.S.K. and Croatia on the 
cessation of hostilities and on the disengagement of forces. 
  General Novakovic, president of the R.S.K. Committee for the 
Implementation of the Agreement, informed the head of the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) observer team, General Bastijans, 
about this during their talks in Knin, the political center of 
the R.S.K. 
  The talks were initiated by General Bastijans, General 
Novakovic told TANJUG. 
  Novakovic added that General Bastijans was warned about the 
Croatian Army transports in the zones subject to transport 
control, and about the presence of Croatian heavy weapons in the 
areas covered by the agreement. 
  The agreement, which took effect on April 4, provides for 
the 
two warring sides to withdraw their infantry one kilometer from 
the disengagement line and for UNPROFOR members to enter the 
buffer zone. It also provides for the R.S.K. and Croatia to pull 
out their heavy weaponry (mortars) 10 km and artillery and tanks 
20 km from the front line. 
  According to General Novakovic, it was specified during the 
talks that U.N. military observers were the only ones in charge 
of control of the implementation of the agreement on the 
Croatian side. 
  Novakovic said they agreed during the talks that U.N. 
military observers were obliged to uncover possible preparations 
of the Croatian side for any military actions. The ceasefire 
agreement envisages such an obligation, which was not in the 
UNPROFOR mandate before this agreement. 
  The military observers pointed out they did not want to be 
remembered by failing to accomplish their mission, said General 
Novakovic. 
  The R.S.K. was formed in 1991 in the territory of Croatia 
populated by the Serbs in response to Croatia's secession from 
the former Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce the status of 
Serb people to that of a national minority. The R.S.K. was 
proclaimed a U.N. Protected Area (UNPA) in March 1992.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Jakovcic, president of the Istrian </F>
Democratic Congress, by Davor Ivankovic; place and date not 
given: "We Want Counties After Radic's Model"] 
  [Text] At the time of the most severe crisis so far 
between Istria and the central state authorities, the Fifth 
Special Convention of the Istrian Democratic Congress [IDS], the 
number one Istrian party, was held in Rovinj. At the 
convention, four declarations were issued that will become IDS 
program material and in which the main IDS regionalist 
orientations are listed. It is clear from the text of the 
declarations that the IDS has taken a new, clearer, and more 
open course toward the accomplishment of the autonomy of Istria. 
We talked about this with the party president Ivan 
Jakovcic. 
  [Ivankovic] Why was the Fifth IDS Convention a special 
convention? 
  [Jakovcic] Because the regular ones are held every two 
years, and this one was programmatic. The IDS has adopted many 
important documents relating to our specific political aim. The 
most important thing is that it was a dignified meeting of 
people who hold similar views and who want good for our state. 
Those who expected a spectacular development of events at this 
convention, and who, even before it took place, threatened 
Istria with the army and police, are now politically defeated in 
this area. 
<H5>  This Is Not Autonomism </H5>
  [Ivankovic] Many will say that the declarations you have 
adopted (on Istria being a European region, on the autonomous 
County of Istria, on the democratization of the Republic of 
Croatia, and on the regional organization of the Republic of 
Croatia) display clear and evident autonomism. 
  [Jakovcic] This has nothing to do with autonomism, because 
autonomism is a concept of political activities aimed at 
breaking up a state, whereas we are building Croatia and 
proposing a new vision of Croatia to the citizens of Croatia. 
If Croatia were organized through its historical regions of 
Istria, Dalmatia, Slavonia and Baranja, Medjimurje, Zagorje, 
Lika, and so on, it would be completely normal if these regions 
had a certain status. Some regions could have autonomy, and 
some could have other statuses, instead of what the Croatian 
authorities have, judging by indications, agreed to, which is 
the confederalization of Croatia, and which it has been forced 
into because it was incapable of forming a different territorial 
organization. The autonomy of the individual, a group, a town, 
region, or municipality is something that is based on 
subsidiarity, which is the basis of Christian democracy. Those 
who wish to call themselves a Christian democratic party in 
Croatia do not in fact understand what it means. 
  [Ivankovic] One gets the impression that, by adopting the 
declarations, you have achieved what you had not dared even put 
into the suspended Statute. What is the formal and legal 
significance of these documents? 
  [Jakovcic] The declarations are the expression of our 
political wishes, of our will; they are the expression of what 
we intend to achieve through the institutions of the system. 
There are no possibilities and there is no need for the IDS to 
proclaim anything or do anything independently as long as the 
democratic system is in power. As long as the Croatian 
Parliament, the government, and the president are functioning, 
there will be democratic institutes, which are what goals should 
be achieved through. This is the direction our proposals for 
constitutional laws, built on the basis of these declarations, 
follow. We have observed the democratic procedure. Naturally, 
our proposals for constitutional laws will be put on the agenda 
of the Croatian Parliament only when the majority in the 
Croatian Parliament is behind our proposal. Therefore, with 
these documents we followed what we presented to President 
Tudjman at Brijuni late last summer, except now the highest IDS 
group stands behind them. 
<H5>  The Constitution Once and Now... </H5>
  [Ivankovic] These documents now state in writing your 
demands for a region, not county, for legislative power, most of 
the direct revenue.... 
  [Jakovcic] Naturally. These proposals ensue from two basic 
postulates -- getting to know about the European organization 
and the desire to organize Croatia after the model of Austrian 
and Italian regions, which is still far from the achievements of 
the German and Swiss types of federalism. The most beautiful 
caryatid of this idea is based on [Stjepan] Radic's treatment of 
Croatian counties, on his text of the Constitution dating from 
the early Twenties, in which he anticipates the counties to, I 
quote, "pass regulations that have the validity of laws." We 
must oppose those who now want to suspend Radic's positions! 
  [Ivankovic] However, everything you are demanding 
contradicts the existing Croatian Constitution. 
  [Jakovcic] The declarations we have adopted do not have this 
Croatian Constitution as a starting point. Our task, as the 
task of any other political party, is to fight for the 
achievement of our political aims in a democratic way. On the 
other hand, a change of the Constitution and the laws is to be 
expected, and this is our political aim, but it is not the only 
one. We are also asking for the change of the 
super-presidential political system; we want a parliamentary 
system in which the parliament and the government will have 
autonomy. 
<H5>  We Want Early Elections </H5>
  [Ivankovic] It would be difficult to expect that your party 
will ever be in power in Croatia, except maybe in a coalition. 
Have you discussed these programmatic wishes with possible 
party partners in Croatia, and have they supported them? 
  [Jakovcic] We have recently witnessed a great 
stratification in the political life of Croatia, especially over 
the past few weeks. The balance of political power is changing 
rapidly; stratification has occured in literally all Croatian 
political parties. Evidently it is necessary to consider early 
elections. I am sure that they will facilitate a different 
balance of power in the Croatian Parliament, which will provide 
the opportunity for the IDS to get closer to participating in 
the central state authorities! This is our aim and our wish. As 
far as the disposition of political parties regarding our 
political program is concerned, I must say that it is to be 
expected that our ideas will not be welcomed with open arms. 
However, the achieving of political aims is also a result of 
compromise and interests, of the balance of powers at the 
appropriate moment. 
  [Ivankovic] Could it be concluded that this new course 
coincides with the crisis at the top of Croatian politics? 
  [Jakovcic] No! The interpretations that say we want to 
strike at the moment the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] is 
weak are wrong. We were supposed to adopt these documents at 
the party convention in February, in Pazin, but we were not able 
to do so due to the events in our party. We convened this one a 
month and a half ago. 
  [Ivankovic] One of the declarations mentions a territorial 
expansion of Istria. You state that Opatija, Cres, Mali Losinj, 
Matulji, Moscenicka Draga, and other towns also belong to you. 
  [Jakovcic] This is our well-known political position. It is 
not surprising, as our party is in power in that area; it is 
certainly also because of that part of our program that we 
gained the trust of the people there. If a referendum were to 
be held in these areas, they would certainly join the County of 
Istria, and it is our duty to let them express their positions, 
if nothing else. Naturally, nothing will be done by force, as 
was the case with the territorial organization of Croatia, when 
these regions were left out of the territory of our county 
exclusively because the people were against the HDZ, the local 
HDZ. 
  [Ivankovic] Would you explain the position stated in the 
declarations that a referendum is more valid than the decisions 
made by the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia? 
  [Jakovcic] Take the confederation, which is a topical issue, 
for instance. It is unacceptable to the IDS that a decision on, 
say, joining a confederation with any state is made in 
parliament. That has to be the result of a referendum. 
<H5>  A Referendum for Changes </H5>
  [Ivankovic] This position on referendums does not relate to 
Istria then? 
  [Jakovcic] No, it would not mean that, for instance, a 
referendum in Istria would be more powerful than the decisions 
made by the Croatian Parliament. But, while we are on the 
subject of a referendum in Istria, I believe that referendums 
should be held when there is a wish for change, rather than 
imposing something. This does not only relate to Istria, but to 
the whole of Croatia. 
  [Ivankovic] There have been estimates that this is the most 
severe crisis in the relations between Istria and the central 
authorities ever. 
  [Jakovcic] I would not say this was the most severe crisis; 
the issue is only the continuity of the politics toward Istria 
that has now started to show its cards, having stated that it 
can consolidate its positions in Istria with the police and 
army, which is crazy! Except for the raised voice, there is 
nothing new there. The fact is that the reputation of Croatian 
leadership is at present the worst since we have had the 
multiparty system! 
  [Ivankovic] How do you think things will develop regarding 
the suspension of the Statute of the County of Istria? 
  [Jakovcic] It is difficult to predict, as circumstances 
change very quickly, and the judiciary in Croatia is obviously 
not independent. Ivic Pasalic's statement that "judges should 
implement the state policies" is a clear indication of that. 
The Statute may be suspended, but it will not change the 
policies of the IDS, the County Assembly, and, least of all, of 
our people. 
  [Ivankovic] Is the statute unconstitutional or not? 
  [Jakovcic] Absolutely not! It would be fair if those who 
have been trying to have it suspended return it, so it can be 
seen if there is anything that could perhaps be altered. 
Regardless of that, I am sure we will be able to prove that our 
statute complies with the Constitution and the laws. 
  [Ivankovic] Is there a danger of a commission being 
appointed 
in Istria, thus blocking the local authorities and introducing a 
kind of "state of emergency"? 
  [Jakovcic] If that were to happen, it would represent the 
definite end of the politics that subsists on conflicts anyway, 
and as it gets difficult to find enemies, they are now found in 
Istria. The appointment of the Council for Istria and the 
announcement of the suspension of our statute happening at the 
same time is no coincidence. The party in power wants to 
mitigate its own crisis through the media, and is therefore now 
trying to concentrate everything on Istria. 
<H5>  Osimo Is Out of Date </H5>
  [Ivankovic] Does it not seem to you now, after President 
Tudjman asked that more people be appointed to the Council for 
Istria, that his approach is more flexible? 
  [Jakovcic] This move was made at the moment it became clear 
that the Council could fall apart, which would have been a great 
discredit to those who founded the Council. If the task of the 
Council was presenting the positions of the IDS and the citizens 
of Istria to the president of the Republic, it would be 
acceptable. However, that is evidently not the case. 
  [Ivankovic] You have now stated in the documents what you 
had only talked about before, which is that Istria is left with 
only two-thirds of the direct revenue, while one third goes to 
the state. 
  [Jakovcic] That is the political position in principle, to 
establish exactly what the direct revenue is, which would be in 
accordance with the authorizations. The state would thus have 
the basic attributes of statehood, which each region would have 
to finance, and the regions would have a financial base. It is 
really absurd that towns now have much greater budgets than the 
counties they are in. 
  [Ivankovic] What is your interpretation of the political 
situation in Italy and the demands regarding our territory? 
  [Jakovcic] There are neofascists everywhere. The Serbs have 
them -- they want Greater Serbia; there are those who talk of a 
banner on the Romanija, and then there are those who say that 
Istria and Dalmatia are Italian. I am sure that the new Italian 
Government will not consider these ideas of changing the 
borders. At any rate, the IDS will be the first to oppose any 
possibility of changing the borders, as every change of borders 
in Istria always had a tragic end. 
  [Ivankovic] What about the annexes to the Osimo Accords? 
  [Jakovcic] They are simply necessary, as the Accords are out 
of date. Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy should start constructive 
talks. I would like to ask the authorities to include us, who 
have a direct interest in it, in the process. 
<H5>  [Box 1, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Istria as a European Region </H5>
  [Ivankovic] One of the declarations you have adopted is the 
Declaration on Istria as a European Region, consisting of 
Croatian municipalities, three Slovenian ones, and one Italian. 
You have proposed that Porec be the center of the region. 
  [Jakovcic] The concept of the organization of the European 
region is similar to those of which there are about 40 in the 
European Union, and it was drawn up with the hope that Croatia 
and Slovenia aspire to the European Union. This final draft of 
the declaration shows that no one here wants either an Istrian 
Republic or state, as is said in the accusations of the 
neofascists in Croatia, but that we want the free movement of 
people, capital, and ideas on the territory where it has always 
worked. I hope that it will be met with understanding in the 
Croatian, Slovene, and Italian Parliaments. When Croatia is 
accepted at the Council of Europe, we will present this as a 
clear demand. 
<H5>  [Box 2, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Demilitarization </H5>
  [Ivankovic] You have demanded that Istria be a demilitarized 
zone. 
  [Jakovcic] Our position that ladies in print pants rather 
than uniformed soldiers should walk around Istria is well known. 
This is not possible to regulate at present due to the semiwar 
situation our state is in, but of Istria it is both an objective 
need and a possibility. We would like to remind those who say 
we are asking for this because the Istrians do not want to serve 
in the Croatian Army and participate in safeguarding the 
independence and sovereignty of Croatia, that even the highest 
officials of the Ministry of Defense have established that the 
degree of positive response to mobilization in Croatia was by 
far the highest in Istria, and that our boys behave in a highly 
disciplined way at the frontlines.

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak by </F>
Stipe Pudja; place and date not given: "I Was Prepared To Resign 
Because of Duboki Jarak!"] 
  [Text] Gojko Susak, defense minister of the Republic of 
Croatia, is the only Croatian minister who has been a member of 
all five Croatian governments so far. Although he enjoys the 
support and is respected by his ministry as well as by the 
Croatian Army, Minister Susak, together with President Tudjman, 
was one of the most criticized men of the Croatian state 
leadership by the opposition. We talked to Minister Susak about 
that as well as about the latest withdrawals from the HDZ 
[Croatian Democratic Community] of the President of the Chamber 
of Representatives Stipe Mesic and the President of the Chamber 
of Counties Josip Manolic. 
  At the beginning of the interview, we asked him about the 
latest events in the ruling party, and Minister Susak, who is 
also the vice president of the HDZ, said: 
  [Susak] I personally think the present process in the party 
is extremely positive. In the evolution of the Croatian state, 
we entered the political scene as a movement which, in due 
course, must grow into a party whose views and guidelines were 
publicly and clearly set by President Tudjman at the Second 
General Assembly of the HDZ. We voted and agreed to ratify the 
party program and people who will implement it. Such phenomena 
are normal in all parties in the world, not to mention our 
process of transformation from a movement into a party. I do 
not see it as a rift, nor as a cause for panic in the party. I 
think, and so do most HDZ members, that, after they [Mesic and 
Manolic] leave, the membership of the HDZ will be even stronger. 
Therefore, I believe this will prompt a large number of people 
of quality to join the HDZ. 
  [Pudja] Leaving the HDZ, Mr. Manolic and Mr. Mesic were very 
critical of your work at the Ministry of Defense. What do you 
think about that and is this constructive criticism? 
  [Susak] In the past year, and it will probably be so for a 
while, the Defense Ministry has been one of the most important 
departments, but also one of the most controversial ones, owing 
to the global political and military situation of the Republic 
of Croatia. And it is only natural that both the Defense 
Ministry and myself are subject to criticism regardless of 
whether it is well-founded or not. Criticism is always welcome. 
The fact is that we are now in the position that every citizen, 
regardless of his or her function, can voice his or her opinion. 
We advocated that right and our army fought to preserve our 
territory and such a system. However, criticism is also subject 
to analysis. Those who criticize the Ministry of Defense and 
especially myself as the key man of the Ministry, must 
substantiate their accusations with some proof. I am willing to 
face the Croatian public, let them analyze the situation if they 
want, even with the help independent experts, from the moment I 
took office at the Ministry to the present. That does not 
justify my mistakes, if there were any, and I must have made 
some, as I am only human. However, I am willing to face the 
judgment of the public and of experts and let them evaluate my 
work and results. Let me remind you that, recently, during a 
session of the parliament, there was an attempt to call for a 
vote of no confidence in me. I think that voting for a vote of 
confidence or no confidence in me in the parliament in free and 
independent Croatia would be the most exhilarating moment. That 
would be the system I fought for and I would be honored, 
regardless of the outcome of voting. I will use this 
opportunity to ask my party to agree to that. 
<H5>  Former Intelligence Services </H5>
  [Pudja] You have not quite answered my question. Do you 
know why Manolic, in addition to referring to President Tudjman, 
most often refers to you personally? Is there, perhaps, 
something we do not know? 
  [Susak] Yes, but in Mr. Manolic's frame of mind, which is 
probably the result of his life-long orientation and experience, 
which does not correspond to Croatian views and the road Croatia 
was supposed to take. He chose his own path and the Croatian 
public will have their say about that and decide whether his way 
is better than what I advocate. After all, there will be more 
elections and we will see the judgment of the Croatian nation. 
  [Pudja] Could you comment on the fact that some people 
from the ruling party are founding a new party? As those men 
are the presidents of the two chambers of the parliament, could 
this result in a parliamentary crisis and malfunctioning of the 
state? 
  [Susak] Our party itself could not have chosen a better 
moment for such an event. The HDZ has not for a single moment, 
in the past four years of its existence, been in a better 
position to solve such problems. The international and domestic 
situation in Croatia has never been safer or more stable. The 
fact that their timing is bad points to their political naivete. 
If their plan was to provoke and destabilize the system and 
disrupt the functioning of the state, my opinion is that they 
could not have chosen a worse moment. But that is their choice 
and we will accept the challenge. We will not deal with them 
the way they dealt with their enemies while they had power in 
the former regime. From the beginning, we advocated a Croatia 
whose every citizen will be able to air his or her views, 
whatever they may be. 
  [Pudja] At the meeting in Dubrovnik, you also brought up 
three of Manolic's followers -- Boljkovac, Karic, and Degoricija 
-- as they were members of former intelligence services and you 
said the HDZ would get stronger after they leave. 
  [Susak] Regarding the said gentlemen, we know they come from 
similar structures and have similar views. At the beginning, 
the HDZ was organized as a movement comprising all kinds of 
views and structures. I think they were the only structure that 
was connected by the fact that they all, at one point, worked 
for former intelligence services, regardless of what they were 
called, from 1945 to the free general elections. They all have 
that in common, from those leaders who chose to leave to those 
who will follow them. I do not want to speculate about that, but 
there is a possibility that they will resort to some kind of 
blackmail or something else. Regardless of what we may think, 
Manolic was one of the most responsible officials in our time, 
as well. If the system of a law-ordered state failed at the 
Ministry of Defense or some other ministry, why did he not react 
then? That is odd. He had the opportunity to call us to 
account for what happened and he could even dismiss us. I find 
it odd that he chose to do that now. That should tell us much 
about his intentions. As for their holding us accountable, I 
would like to see both Manolic and Mesic present concrete 
examples and substantiate their accusations. 
  [Pudja] Manolic's group also blames the Croatian leadership 
and you personally for the conflict between the Croats and the 
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Susak] I think that what Manolic reproaches us for is the 
least important factor in the conflict between the Croats and 
the Muslims. If he had cared about interests of the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, he would have taken concrete steps in the 
past three to four years and done something himself, both 
publicly and secretly. There had to be much secret work in order 
to organize the local Croat population and defend the territory 
where they live. I think the fact of the matter is something 
completely different. They say we are to blame, that those 
conflicts were caused by Croatian state politics, but my only 
reply is that the Croatian state leadership and the leaders of 
the HDZ -- and I am one of them -- have been consistent in 
implementing our policies toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the 
moment Bosnia-Herzegovina was recognized to the referendum and 
acceptance of all proposals of the international community. The 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats and their leadership were the only one 
of the three nations to have accepted all proposals of the 
international community in order to establish peace. We could 
not have implemented that on our own, for it takes at least two 
sides to reach an agreement. The conflict between the Croats 
and the Muslims, which unfortunately broke out, was not in the 
interest of Croatia, nor in the interest of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats. It was against our interests and 
that is why Croatia cannot be blamed. That does not justify 
mistakes that happened on lower levels among the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, our policies have been consistent 
from day one and we are prepared to render an account of our 
implementation of such policies. 

<H5>    The Example of Konjic </H5>
  [Pudja] You also said that the first shipment of weapons 
from 
Croatia went to Foca. 
  [Susak] Yes. The first shipment did go to Foca thanks to a 
local Muslim representative. Unfortunately, they lost Foca, not 
because they had no desire to defend it, but because they did 
not receive support from where they were supposed to get it. 
That does not mean that, given that support, they could have 
defended it, but during the most critical moments, the Bosnian 
leadership did not realize how serious the situation was. I do 
not mean this as a criticism, we all made mistakes, but this is 
a fragment that must also be considered in analyzing the events 
of the past two and a half years. One cannot blame the policies 
of one side or the other for the conflict between the Croats and 
the Muslims. As a result of the Serb aggression, several 
thousand refugees were forced into a small area where it was 
impossible to live and that is why there were misunderstandings. 
Very often the official Bosnia-Herzegovina leadership failed in 
the most crucial moments. Afterwards, they tried, and are still 
trying, to make up for that, but that is another matter. That 
will not justify the first days when they were not up to the 
moment and when we could not find partners in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina leadership to organize a more effective 
defense together. Their dilemma was whether to ask the 
"Yugoslav Army to defend them from the Chetniks." However, when 
that army showed its true colors there as well, it was too late 
to do anything efficiently. Unlike their leaders, some Muslim 
individuals realized what was the essential problem and came 
directly to Zagreb for help. That is why we sent those weapons 
to Foca. 
  [Pudja] The Croats were accused of being responsible for 
those conflicts at the Bosnia-Herzegovina assembly in Sarajevo 
as well. 
  [Susak] Those were isolated examples. Prime Minister 
Silajdzic said that himself. The Croats cannot be blamed for 
that tragic conflict. The Muslims could not have gotten their 
first weapons from anywhere else but from Croatia or from the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats against whom they used them. I 
repeat, there were mistakes at lower levels and in some 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Croat structures. We have documented the 
case of Konjic, where the ratio of Croats and Muslims is less 
favorable. The first shipment of weapons from Croatia that got 
to Konjic was divided equally among the Croats and the Muslims. 
The Muslims abused that and seized power in Konjic using 
weapons they got from the Croats. The cases of Bugojno, 
Travnik, and other towns are well-documented too. In a 
nutshell, the enemy of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina was far 
too recognizable and powerful for the Croats to reach for 
another enemy. 
<H5>  Investigation Into Sesvete </H5>
  [Pudja] Your political opponents also say you are 
responsible for the explosion in Duboki Jarak [a suburb of 
Zagreb]. They think you should be held accountable as the 
defense minister. 
  [Susak] The defense minister would, in normal procedures and 
conditions, have to be responsible for what happened in Duboki 
Jarak. However, there has been much misinformation in the 
public and two items are very important. Firstly, at the time 
of the accident I was away on business in Mostar. I was 
informed about the accident at about 1430 and I reported to the 
supreme commander and the president of the Republic at about 
1900. Newspapers say I came one day later, which is not true. 
I will not reveal what the president and I talked about. I was 
prepared to resign. In normal circumstances, I take the 
political responsibility regardless of the facts. However, 
President Tudjman, who appointed me defense minister, thought I 
should not resign. It is common knowledge that a defense 
minister does not hand in his resignation to the parliament, but 
to President Tudjman, and it is up to the parliament to analyze 
all the events and form their opinion about me in a regular 
procedure. 
  [Pudja] With regard to what happened in Sesvete, you 
personally suggested to bring in commissions from abroad. 
  [Susak] It would be irresponsible of me if I did not get 
several opinions about the explosion. At the meeting with 
President Tudjman, in addition to the commission of the Defense 
Ministry which was appointed by the president personally, I 
requested to send for another independent commission from 
abroad. At the same time, we filed a request with NATO and 
France. The French contacted us first and we accepted their 
commission. NATO, which contacted us later, offered to send a 
group that would help us destroy leftover bombs which did not 
explode, and we accepted. Those commissions will soon submit 
their reports to appropriate organs, which will then decide 
about who is responsible for the explosion. 
  [Pudja] Can you, perhaps, tell us when will those reports be 
made public? 
  [Susak] I think the commissions will finish their job within 
the next two weeks. First results could be expected even 
sooner. All things considered, the results will be presented to 
the public and for discussion in the parliament in the next two 
weeks. There is no way I can influence the work of those 
commissions and their results. You know that the Ministry of 
Justice appointed a judge who gives entrance and exit 
permissions to all commissions. 
  [Pudja] Are there any indications as to the cause of the 
explosion? 
  [Susak] I would not like to speculate about that at this 
point. It would not be good for the work of the commissions. 
Journalists and analysts can afford to speculate, but a defense 
minister cannot. 
<H5>  Spegelj's Slander </H5>
  [Pudja] In spite of various expectations about the 
respectability of the Croatian Army and about the situation 
regarding the military industry of Croatia, you were the one who 
spoke about that the least. 
  [Susak] You are here to ask questions, and I am here to 
answer them. I would not like to discuss the respectability of 
the Croatian Army at present. That is up to military experts to 
say. In public, we hear both views. However, the most 
surprising thing is that former defense minister and commander 
of the Supreme Headquarters General Spegelj says that the 
Defense Ministry and Supreme Headquarters are mostly composed of 
people who are not trained for their jobs. I do not know to 
whom he refers, perhaps General Bobetko or somebody else. 
Professional skill is assessed by means of comparison. I, as 
the defense minister, can be reproached for not being a soldier. 
I think this ministry is just like any other ministry. My role 
is to find the best possible personnel and means in order to 
make the system work. I think it is in the interest of Croatia 
that a civilian, regardless of who it may be, be at the head of 
the Defense Ministry, for we do not want Croatia to be a 
military state, but a democratic country. The Army is just one 
of the factors which protects and establishes the system of the 
state. Whether, in the past two and a half years, I justified 
the confidence of the president of the Republic and of the prime 
ministers, that is up to them and to the Croatian people to 
deduce on the basis of unbiased analyses. They should look into 
the state of the Croatian Army when I took office, into 
circumstances regarding the acquisition of its equipment, into 
the state of Croatian military industry, and compare the 
responsibility of the Croatian Army then and at present. Let me 
remind you, when I became defense minister, an arms embargo was 
already imposed on Croatia. 
  [Pudja] People think that the Croatian Army can regain the 
remaining part of the occupied territory of Croatia. So far, we 
have been trying to regain that territory and include it in the 
system of Croatia in a peaceful manner. Will that be the case 
from now on as well? 
  [Susak] According to estimates and reports of not only those 
who are in charge of that in our ministry, but also of other 
reports, the Croatian Army can liberate the entire Croatian 
territory, by force if necessary. But I would like to repeat 
what our president said: The first task of our state politics 
is to reach our goal with minimum casualties. However, if we 
are forced to resort to force, if there is no way out, we are 
prepared to do that and liberate our territory. 

<H5>    [Box, p 6] </H5>
<H5>  Accusation </H5>
  [Susak] Manolic's statement that I stepped in and arranged 
the release of a certain colonel of the Information and Security 
Service, and that he was smuggling drugs, is an accusation that 
deserves to go to court. Both the Justice Ministry and the 
Ministry of Interior and their ministers have publicly denied 
those accusations. If I were doing something else and if I had 
the time, I would immediately begin legal action against Joza 
Manolic. 
<H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>
<H5>  Emigration and the Croatian Independent Democrats </H5>
  [Susak] The Croatian Independent Democrats would like to 
spread some information about emigration and the names of people 
who allegedly want to join their party. I think the emigration 
will commit themselves on that. Manolic and Mesic have only a 
handful of emigrants' names -- I say names, for those are 
obviously not people. As to the question why there are so many 
emigrants, that should be answered by Mr. Manolic, who had a 
very important function at the time when a large number of 
Croats were forced to leave their homes. 
<H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>
<H5>  Christian Morality </H5>
  [Susak] We, members of the HDZ, do not advocate a 
clericalist party, as Mr. Duka and Mr. Juric say; rather, we 
advocate what every party of that orientation in Western 
democracy wants -- to build the state on Christian morality. On 
the basis of that and as a national party we want -- as long as 
we enjoy the confidence of the Croatian nation -- to create the 
Croatian state. 
<H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>
<H5>  Care </H5>
  [Susak] Caring for disabled veterans and families of 
soldiers 
who died defending our country is the duty of the entire 
Croatian state. At the latest session of the government, I 
proposed that a session be dedicated exclusively to problems of 
wounded soldiers and families of dead soldiers, and the proposal 
was unanimously accepted. Within our means, the Defense 
Ministry will make a concrete step toward solving at least those 
initial problems with accommodation. I will propose that housing 
funds be established in every county and that loans be provided 
for those who could solve their housing problems. I think that, 
if we continue with our present budget policy and with this 
government, we will be able to solve that part of the problem.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mario Marusic: "Federation Hanging in the </F>
Balance"] 
  [Text] Mostar (from VJESNIK's staff correspondent) -- At 
present, the key question in relations between the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats and Bosniaks is the election of the 
president and prime minister. The question has not been solved 
even after the latest round of negotiations in Sarajevo, 
although both sides presented legal and political arguments in 
favor of their representative, Bosniak or Croat, respectively. 
Since the matter will not be resolved even after the 30-day 
deadline for the elections stipulated by the Constitution, this 
could cut deeply into future negotiations and significantly 
influence the (non)implementation of the Washington Agreement, 
that is, of what was agreed in Sarajevo. Regardless of that, 
Kresimir Zubak and Haris Silajdzic both said the Sarajevo 
negotiations had been "extremely constructive and positive." 
<H5>  The Question of Outvoting </H5>
  The reason behind Zubak's and Silajdzic's optimism is, first 
of all, the successful negotiations on the organization of the 
future federal government. It was agreed that, in the period 
that follows, the reconstructed government shall act both as the 
Bosniak and the federal government and that it will be composed 
of 12 department ministers and another three members, one of 
whom would be the president of the Federation (although they 
still have not agreed on which departments would be run by 
Croats and which by Bosniaks). Furthermore, the heads of both 
delegations said that they were well satisfied with the progress 
of the negotiations about economic and humanitarian questions. 
However, it would be difficult to speak about progress in 
Croat-Bosniak relations until the most important problems that 
are crucial for the future federation are solved. 
  As for the "crucial" arguments about the election of the 
president and the prime minister, reliable sources report that, 
in spite of diplomatic words like "constructiveness," with 
regard to some problems, the Bosniak-Muslim side will not 
relinquish principles that in no way promote the spirit of the 
Washington Agreement. Quite the contrary, they keep saying that 
the Bosniaks are "the most populous" nation and that "most 
victims in this war have been Bosniaks." If such is the case, 
it will be very difficult to reach a mutually satisfactory 
solution and form (any kind of) federation. Perhaps this is a 
bit too pessimistic a statement, but insisting on the fact that 
one nation is in the majority (while the Washington agreement 
speaks only about equal, constituent, and sovereign nations) is 
evidence of a stubborn streak in sticking to views which are 
usually present with regard to a civic, that is, unitary 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the Muslim-Bosniak leaders have 
advocated all the time and which has been the bone of contention 
in relations between the two nations. Therefore, it does not 
make much sense to repeat something like that after Washington. 
The question of outvoting, which was thought to be history 
after adopting the Constitution of the Federation, seems to have 
reappeared and is reaching its desired goal, which was one of 
the main causes of the Croat-Muslim conflict. 
<H5>  President for Life </H5>
  Moreover, concern over the (too) slow implementation of the 
agreement is amplified by the fact that the Bosniak-Muslim side 
is relentless in waging a media war, and Sarajevo Radio and the 
Mostar "War Studio" are cases in point. The specially 
established UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commission had many 
complaints with regard to that. In the eyes of the 
Bosniak-Muslim media, Alija Izetbegovic is still the (only 
possible) president (of the federation as well), and he gets 
most support from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Its corps and 
brigades simply compete in giving public support to Izetbegovic, 
who could enjoy a full five years of the presidency with a 
one-year mandate only. Evidently, there is a preponderance of 
his followers among the Sarajevo leadership and, as opposed to 
the "reconcilable" Silajdzic, Izetbegovic wants both leading 
positions in the future Federation, probably thinking that they 
can form a federation "with themselves." It is high time that 
Sarajevo realized that their political partners are legally 
elected representatives of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
that they must reach a democratic agreement on everything. For, 
if there is a lack of will to do this (and the Bosniaks have not 
proven themselves prepared for this so far), the entire project 
of the joint Federation may fall through, which can lead to 
(another) situation that is difficult to solve, especially as 
the third side (the Bosnian Serbs) are again militarily active 
on all the fronts trying to cause complete chaos in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Article by Stefan Hrcka: "Deputies `On Strike' Again; </F>
Parliament Passed Environmental Impact Assessment Law"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--As on 28 April, yesterday 
opposition deputies went "on strike" again and boycotted the 
vote on supplementing the Slovak Television Council. Because 
even some coalition deputies were not present in parliament, the 
legislative body did not have a quorum. Ludovit Cernak (National 
Democratic Party-New Alternative), who chaired the session, 
therefore declared yesterday's third day of the 30th meeting of 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic closed at noon, 
shortly after 1200. 
  At the outset of yesterday's session, before 0930, the 
deputies started discussing the government-sponsored draft law 
on environmental impact assessment, which has been in 
preparation for over two years. In putting forward the bill, 
Minister of Environment Juraj Hrasko stressed that it is fully 
compatible with comparable legislation in member countries of 
the European Union and other economically advanced countries of 
the world. [passage omitted] Parliament approved the bill with 
the proviso that it will go into effect on 1 July 1994. [passage 
omitted] 
  The National Council then approved, for the second time, the 
amendment to the law on arbitration proceedings in international 
trade relations and the execution of arbitration decisions, 
which had been returned to parliament by the president. The 
amendment, which will go into effect on 1 June 1994, changes the 
name of the law and extends its applicability to domestic trade, 
as well. The deputies then elected Frantisek Javorsky 
(Christian Democratic Movement) as member of the special 
parliamentary body for supervising the activity of the Slovak 
Information Service. (He replaces Ladislav Pittner, who has 
become the minister of the interior.) Parliament also 
acknowledged the resignation of Peter Papan from the Slovak 
Television Council. A secret vote was held, in which parliament 
was to elect three new members of the Slovak Television Council 
to replace members who resigned. The vote was invalid, however, 
because only 65 deputies participated in it and not the required 
50 percent plus one majority of deputies. [passage omitted] 
Ludovit Cernak therefore declared the deliberations closed. He 
also said that parliament did not have a quorum because deputies 
for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak 
National Party did not present themselves, even though they were 
present. The parliament meeting will continue on Wednesday [4 
May].

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Allegedly Mendacious Defamations"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--Referring to the Slovak press, the 
Austrian APA agency yesterday reported that Anna Nagyova, former 
director of the Slovak prime minister's secretariat, was 
expecting a baby by former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. In 
addition to this information, the APA report also contains 
several invectives regarding their "supposedly not merely 
official business relations" and marital problems in both 
families. A statement made available to TA SR yesterday by 
Ondrej Hanko, spokesman for the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS], notes in this context that, "by its vulgar, 
unsubstantiated, and mendacious contents, the APA report defames 
HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar and Anna Nagyova, head of his 
secretariat." In the name of the HZDS, Hanko openly asked 
Austrian President Thomas Klestil, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, 
and Parliament Chairman Heinz Fischer how they assess the fact 
that, "before the early elections, Austrian media are 
interfering grossly and in the dirtiest possible way in the 
election campaign by their unfounded scandalization of a leading 
politician, the chairman of the largest political entity in 
neighboring Slovakia." He asks whether this does not constitute 
interference in the internal affairs of a neighboring country 
and in the hitherto exemplary friendly relations, which have 
been successfully developed by Meciar personally. HZDS 
representatives also sent a similar statement to leading 
Austrian dailies.

  [Text] At its most recent session, the Slovak Government 
decided to abolish the former Cabinet resolution refusing any 
alteration of the border with the Czech Republic. It thus 
accepts the original proposal of the two countries' interior 
ministers, who agreed to exchange the Czech settlement of U 
Sabotu in the village of Javornik for a part of Slovak Sidonia 
near Brumov-Bylnice, Zlin district. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus said the following after the government session: 
  [Begin Klaus recording] We know about the Slovak 
Government's 
decision only from the communications media. I asked the 
interior minister to discover precisely the definitive meaning, 
shape, manner, and form of this decision. We would not like to 
do anything hasty on the basis of a very terse report in the 
media. 
  Naturally, if this could untangle the unsatisfactory story 
of 
still-to-be-resolved border problems, we would be very glad, but 
let us see the decision of the Slovak Government. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by "SME-r": "Trust in Politicians in Slovakia in </F>
April 1994"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--In a public opinion poll surveying 
trust in individual personalities of political life in Slovakia 
that the Slovak Statistical Office carried out on 1 to 8 April 
1994, 1,287 respondents above age 18 were asked to reply to the 
question: "Which politician operating in the Slovak Republic at 
present enjoys your trust?" Each respondent was able to cite 
three personalities. The mosaic of trustworthy politician was 
made up of 70 names, 11 of whom received more than 3 percent. 
The poll revealed another decline (by 18 percent since 
February) in the group of those who do not trust anyone. 
  Vladimir Meciar enjoys trust among Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] sympathizers (83 percent) and Slovak National 
Party [SNS] sympathizers (39 percent); Jozef Moravcik among 
Bratislava residents (48 percent), Party of the Democratic Left 
[SDL] sympathizers (37 percent), Christian Democratic Movement 
[KDH] sympathizers (40 percent), Alternative of Political 
Realism [APR] sympathizers (76 percent), respondents with 
complete secondary education (30 percent) and university 
education (35 percent), as well as among white-collar workers 
(32 percent). President Michal Kovac is trusted by SDL 
sympathizers (30 percent), KDH sympathizers (43 percent), APR 
sympathizers (45 percent), citizens of Hungarian nationality (44 
percent), and respondents with university education (33 percent).

  [Text] Tirana, May 5 (ATA) -- Albanian Foreign Minister 
Alfred Serreqi said in an interview with RILINDJA newspaper 
right after his talks with the Greek Foreign Minister Carolos 
Papoulias in Zurich, that "the meeting was held in order to 
overcome the grave situation in the Greek-Albanian relations 
whose climax was the April 10 tragic event." Mr. Serreqi said 
that "the Albanian party in the meeting asked further 
explanations about the incident. 
  "Not even indirectly did the Greek party accept to take the 
responsibility that its citizens or nationals had carried out 
the terrorist act against the Albanian recruiters' centre. It 
also did not accept that possible investigation into the case be 
carried out by an international commission, although it offered 
a bilateral cooperation about the event," Mr. Serreqi said. 
  Asked about the coming development of the relations between 
Albania and Greece, Mr. Serreqi said that "we requested from 
Greece to observe our sovereignty, not to interfere in 
Albania's home affairs." Greece admitted that in the future it 
will try to stop religious and other propaganda which is now 
going on about North Epirus. "I may say that this was the 
greatest success of the meeting," Mr. Serreqi underlined. 
  "As regards relations between Albania and Greece, Greece 
reaffirmed that it considers normal relations with Albania as 
very significant. For this reason efforts were made to create a 
normal climate in the relations between the two countries. That 
is, the dialogue remains open," Mr. Serreqi explained. 
  Asked about the state of the Albanian economic emigration to 
Greece, Serreqi said that: "We showed interest in determining a 
legal status for the Albanian economic emigrants in Greece. The 
official Athens is for the approval of this status but on 
several conditions. One must realise that this was the first 
meeting after the incident and as such, it was very difficult." 
  Concerning the fact that Greece is now presiding the 
European 
Union, the Albanian foreign minister said that "Greece is the 
only Balkan country in the European Union, and it will preside 
it until the end of July." "This fact," Mr. Serreqi said, 
"would facilitate the relations between Albania and Greece and 
even broader in the Balkans, but, heretofore, it did not happen 
so."

  [Text] Tirana, May 4 (ATA) -- The National Association of 
the Former Political Prisoners and the Persecuted Ones, the 
Party of Balli Kombetar [National Front], the Albanian People's 
League Party, the Albanian Union Democratic Movement, the 
Ecological Party, and other parties consider the existence of 
the Greek priest, Anastas Janullatos, at the head of the 
Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church as completely 
inappropriate and demand his expulsion. 
  The above political parties and associations support the 
Committee for the Defence of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church 
of Albania which has accused the Greek Government of 
interference into the internal affairs of the Albanian state and 
of the Albanian Autocephalous Church on the eve of Easter, 
through Anastas Janullatos, who is considered by this committee 
as "a foreign and illegal archbishop." 
  Statements in support of the Autocephalous character of the 
Albanian Orthodox Church have been made during Easter also by 
the Democratic Party and the Republican one.

  [Excerpts] Strikes in the Silesia region are spreading. 
The Solidarity Slasko-Dabrowski regional chairman said today 
that railway workers have joined the strike. Strikes began this 
morning at Bytom, Radzionkow, Brynow, Lisow, Kochanowice, Herby 
Stare, and Krupski Mlyn stations. Railway workers from 
Lubliniec joined the strike at 0700. The strikers have stopped 
servicing cargo trains and train engines, a communique says. 
The length of the strike depends on a decision of the 
Solidarity national strike headquarters. Railway workers have 
presented a list of demands that are similar to the trade 
union's national demands. [passage omitted] 
  Miners are also on strike. According to trade unionists, the 
strike continues in 22 hard-coal mines. The State Hard Coal 
Agency in Katowice confirmed that coal is not being mined in 20 
collieries. Miners from three zinc and lead mines are also on 
strike.

Republic on the Occasion of the Israel-PLO Accord"--PAP headline] 
  [Text] Warsaw, 4 May--The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
[MSZ] of the Polish Republic welcomes with satisfaction the 
signing of an accord between Israel and the PLO, which 
determines the manner for the introduction of temporary 
Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho area, the MSZ 
statement sent to PAP on the 4th of this month reads. 
  The concluded agreement is, following the signing in 
Washington on 13 September 1993 of the declaration of principles 
for the Palestinian temporary autonomy, yet another historic 
document regulating the relations between both nations on 
principles of peaceful coexistence, dialogue, and cooperation. 
It is an important step toward the creation of multilateral, 
stable, and just peace in that part of the world. It 
strengthens the conviction that, even the most difficult 
problems and conflicts of the contemporary world may and must be 
resolved in the spirit of mutual tolerance and readiness for 
compromise, the statement reads. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses the conviction 
that 
both sides will continue their efforts toward the peaceful 
solution of all of the complex aspects of their mutual relations 
and toward the creation of a durable base for coexistence of 
both nations. 
  Confirming the readiness to support the efforts toward the 
establishment of durable peace and security in the Middle East 
in cooperation with the international community, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Polish Republic wishes at the same time 
to express Poland's resolve for further development of 
cooperation with all of the states and nations in that part of 
the world, the MSZ statement reads.

<F P=106> [Report by Bernard Besserglik] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, May 5 (AFP) -- A new international peace 
effort due to begin Thursday ran into trouble when a row erupted 
over UN concessions to Serbian forces in the implementation of a 
NATO-imposed exclusion zone around Sarajevo. A mediation team, 
the first to include both US and Russian diplomats, was due in 
Sarajevo later in the day to build on efforts begun last week to 
bridge apparently irreconcilable differences between the Bosnian 
government and separatist Serbs over a country-wide cease-fire. 
  The team was due to meet with leaders of the Moslem-led 
government and Bosnian Serbs before reporting back to a 
ministerial conference on Bosnia which diplomats in Geneva said 
would be held May 13 in the Swiss city. But prospects for the 
peace effort were undermined by Bosnian fury over a UN decision 
to allow seven Serb tanks pass through the exclusion zone around 
Sarajevo to the Mount Igman area just west of the city, where 
the Serbs fear a new offensive by Moslem troops, UN officials 
said. 
  Two Serb tanks passed through the 20-kilometre (12.5-mile) 
exclusion zone on Wednesday, escorted by units of the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR), UNPROFOR spokesman Eric Chaperon 
said. Agreement for the manoeuvre was given by UN envoy Yasushi 
Akashi and UNPROFOR commander Bertrand de Lapresle at a meeting 
with Serb leaders in Pale on Tuesday, Chaperon said. 
  The agreement gave authorisation for seven tanks to pass 
through the zone, and early Wednesday two tanks arriving from 
Pale "were escorted from Lukavica (within the exclusion zone) 
and out of the zone towards Trnovo" in the Mount Igman area, he 
said. The other five tanks were to follow "in the next few 
days" at a time and date to be arranged, he said. 
  The Bosnian government responded to the deal Thursday by 
demanding the dismissal of Akashi. Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic said the government insisted on Akashi's departure 
because "UNPROFOR is making deals with the Serbs." An UNPROFOR 
source speaking on condition of anonymity said the arrangement 
over the tanks involved the UNPROFOR command based in Zagreb and 
by-passed officials in Sarajevo. He described the agreement as 
"a new victory" for the Serbs. "The go-ahead was given directly 
by Zagreb without consulting Sarajevo," said the source, who 
complained of the increasingly restrictive interpretation being 
given by UN officials of the exclusion zone imposed around 
Sarajevo in February. A third Serb T-34 tank from Pale was 
intercepted within the exclusion zone on Tuesday was one of the 
five covered under the agreement with Akashi and Lapresle, 
Chaperon said. 
  It was still under UNPROFOR supervision, he said, describing 
its presence in the zone as part of a "special agreement at the 
highest level." 
  Chaperon confirmed that the Bosnian Government was 
reinforcing its troop presence around Mount Ingman, a strategic 
height overlooking Sarajevo, but he said reports that as many as 
10,000 men had been deployed there were exaggerated. 
  Unconfirmed reports surfaced Wednesday that Akashi had cut a 
deal with the Serbs under which UNPROFOR would let the Serb 
tanks pass through the Sarajevo exclusion zone in exchange for 
the Serbs lifting their blockade of a convoy of British 
peacepeekers trying to reach the eastern town of Gorazde. 
  The convoy, carrying 168 British troops, was allowed to 
proceed late Tuesday from Rogatica, where it had been held up by 
Serb officials since Sunday, but Chaperon said he was "not 
aware" of any link with the concession regarding the Serb tanks. 
Tension remained high in northern Bosnia in the region around 
Brcko, where UNPROFOR has observed a build-up of forces by both 
sides in the past two weeks. Serbs are believed to wish to 
widen the corridor in which Brcko is situated and which links 
Serb-held lands in eastern and western Bosnia, while government 
forces could seek to cut through the five-kilometre (three-mile) 
strip to the Croatian border. 
  In New York early Wednesday the UN Security Council warned 
both sides of the "serious consequences" of any offensive 
action, following a proposal earlier by France to create a 
10-kilometre (six-mile) exclusion zone around the Serb-held 
town. UN military observers have already been deployed to the 
area, and the Security Council ordered envoy Akashi to seek 
"enhanced aerial surveillance of this and other areas of 
tension." 
  Bosnian Army Commander in Chief Rasim Delic was quoted on 
Bosnian television Monday as saying that Brcko was the "key to 
the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina."

  [Text] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- Douglas Hogg, the 
minister of state at the Foreign Office, said in Belgrade today 
that a plan for a comprehensive peace solution in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should be based on a proposal for the 
territorial division advocated by the European Union. I have 
not come to Belgrade with any specific plan, but I brought two 
important messages, Hogg said after his meetings with Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic and Yugoslav Foreign Minister 
Vladislav Jovanovic. Hogg specified that the first message was 
that it was of vital importance to cease hostilities as soon as 
possible. The second message is that it is necessary to realize 
that a comprehensive peace solution in Bosnia is based on a 
division of the country, giving 51 percent of the territory to 
the Muslim-Croat federation. Hogg stressed that the sanctions 
will not be relaxed until the war stops and the peace plan 
begins to be implemented in Bosnia. He confirmed that he had 
discussed with Milosevic and Jovanovic the problem of the UN 
protected areas in Croatia, but he did not specify what they 
talked about. 
  As regards the fresh crisis surrounding Brcko and the latest 
attempts to create an exclusion zone there as well, Hogg said 
that this subject had not been discussed because these talks did 
not involve any details. He stressed that he agreed with the 
increase in the number of UN observers in that area, which the 
Serb side had agreed to as well. 
  Yugoslav Minister Jovanovic explained that the stance on the 
division of Bosnia that Hogg had mentioned was in fact an old EU 
proposal, which Britain believes should be a framework for 
demarcation in the resumed negotiations. This is not a problem 
that should be obstructing the negotiating process and the 
ending of the war at this moment, he underlined. We agreed that 
the work of the contact group is very important and that it is 
necessary to sign an agreement on the cessation of hostilities 
as soon as possible, which should be followed by political 
negotiations, Jovanovic said. 
  What the Yugoslav side insists on, according to him, is that 
the sanctions, as an acute problem, are the basic obstacle to 
the implementation of any political solution either in Bosnia or 
in Krajina, or, for that matter, the entire territory of 
Yugoslavia. We pointed out that the sanctions are a form of 
hostility against the entire Serbian nation, not only against us 
in Yugoslavia, and that before the cessation of hostilities, due 
attention ought to be paid to ending all other forms of 
hostility. The sanctions are one of them, as well as the media 
war and the biased approach of the international community to 
the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Yugoslav crisis in 
general. It would be impossible to cease military hostilities 
while keeping economic, propaganda and other forms in force. 
  Jovanovic told the reporters that Hogg's visit was part of 
the British Government's initiative aimed at "assessing the 
situation" for the work of the contact group which is preparing 
a new peace conference. Hogg conveyed to us the assurances that 
the British Government and probably other Western governments 
were not prepared to fight the war for the Muslims against 
anybody. We do not have any reason to doubt this, even though 
the development of the situation will be the best proof for 
this, Jovanovic said. 
  The assessment of the situation should be carried out before 
the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is signed. The interested parties, i.e. 
representatives of the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims with UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] mediation, will hold further talks to 
discuss whether the agreement will be of limited duration or a 
permanent one, Jovanovic pointed out. 
  According to Jovanovic, Kosovo was also discussed in the 
context of an overall political solution in the former 
Yugoslavia, and after visiting Zagreb, Sarajevo, and Belgrade, 
Hogg will visit Pristina and it is very likely that he will go 
to Zagreb again.

  [Text] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- Milan Babic, foreign 
minister of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], conveyed to 
Geert Ahrens, deputy cochairman of the Conference on the Former 
Yugoslavia, the Serb side's readiness to continue negotiations 
on the normalization of relations between the RSK and Croatia. 
  Babic said that the RSK proposed Turanj or Geneva as a site 
for the negotiations. We believe that it is necessary to 
conduct negotiations in a place that is not beset by political 
tensions, so we suggest Turanj, a place under the control of the 
UN peace force in the buffer zone where peace has already been 
restored, Babic said in a statement to Politika TV. 
  He stressed that Turanj is accessible to both 
representatives 
of the RSK and the Croatian Government -- something that is an 
extra advantage given the fact that at this stage of 
negotiations frequent meetings of technical and expert groups 
would be needed. 
  Babic also says that the Serb side was today presented with 
a 
document by the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, headlined 
"The Program of Economic Affairs," although it was not discussed 
since today's meeting was by and large focused on the question 
of when and where these negotiations were going to take place. 
  Following the meeting Ahrens said that the atmosphere at the 
talks with the RSK foreign minister was excellent and that the 
talks would resume next week. 
  Ahrens added that the Croatian side was also completely 
ready 
to resume negotiations and that some minor details had yet to be 
decided upon prior to the second phase of negotiations.

<F P=106> [Article by "SME-r": "Electoral Decisions of Slovak Republic </F>
Citizens Who Would Definitely or Probably Participate in 
Elections to the National Council of the Slovak Republic If They 
Were To Be Held Today"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--In the first 10 days of April 1994, the 
Slovak Statistical Office [SU SR] carried out its regular 
monthly public opinion research. The sample (1,287 respondents) 
was formed so as to correspond to the composition of the adult 
population of the Slovak Republic in terms of sex, age, 
nationality, level of education, size of community of residence, 
and region. 
  The data acquired in the research suggests that citizens' 
interest in participating in the early parliamentary elections 
increased during the past month. Whereas in March 72 percent of 
eligible voters said that they would definitely or probably 
participate in the elections, their proportion in April was 76 
percent. 
  The greatest difference between individual regions of 
Slovakia as regards participation in the elections is between 
Central Slovakia, where 74 percent of those questioned said that 
they would definitely or probably participate in the elections 
to the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR], and 
Bratislava, where 86 percent of respondents declared their 
interest in going to the polls. Asked which political party or 
movement they would vote for, those adult citizens of Slovakia 
who would definitely or probably participate in the elections 
replied most frequently that they would cast their vote for the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. 
  The most striking changes compared with the preelection 
situation in early March concern precisely this movement, which 
has strengthened its leading position since the last poll. At 
the same time, it increased its lead over the Party of the 
Democratic Left [SDL], which holds second place in the 
distribution of current electoral preferences. 
  Differences among individual regions of Slovakia regarding 
the estimated electoral gains of relevant political forces are 
not statistically significant in the case of the SDL, the 
Alternative of Political Realism [APR], the Slovak National 
Party [SNS], the Democratic Party [DS], and the Social 
Democratic Party of Slovakia [SDSS]. As far as the HZDS is 
concerned, support for the movement in Central Slovakia is 
higher than in all other regions. Characteristic of the 
Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] over the long term is its 
relatively numerous electoral base in East Slovakia. In view of 
the fact that approximately two-thirds of citizens declaring 
themselves of Hungarian nationality will give their votes to 
Hungarian political parties, the estimated electoral results of 
the coalition partners Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
[MKDH] and Coexistence in individual regions of the Slovak 
Republic depend to a decisive degree on the representation of 
ethnic Hungarians in the region in question.

  Electoral preferences are cited only for those political 
entities that would receive in April at least 1.5 percent of the 
vote of adult citizens of the Slovak Republic who are either 
determined to vote or will probably vote. The APR and the 
NDS-NA did not operate as independent political entities at the 
time of the March poll (2-10 March), while the Association of 
Workers of Slovakia had not yet declared itself a political 
entity.

<F P=106> [Article by Tino Teller: "Nuclear Scrap From Prague"] </F>
  [Text] At one point, the main central cooling pump ceased 
to work, the next time the emergency water feeder failed, and 
then an entire reactor block had to be shut down because of an 
operational mistake: A total of 315 major and minor incidents 
were registered at the Czech Dukovany power plant in 1993, 84 of 
which were direct consequences of "human errors." 
  This can be learned from the most secret annual report of 
the 
State Office for Nuclear Safety SUJB ("Statni urad pro jadernou 
bezpecnost") to the Economics Ministry in Prague, which has 
reached the hands of the Upper Austrian Greens Party. 
  A short glance into the secret report, which officially 
exists only in two copies, even exceeds the worst fears 
regarding the state of the Czech nuclear power plants in terms 
of security technology. 
  --In the 52 serious incidents, the operators of the Dukovany 
nuclear power plant had to declare an "unplanned decrease in 
output," which, according to the report, is 28 cases more than 
in 1992, a twofold increase within a single year. 
  --All in all, 13 emergency shutdowns had to be carried out 
at 
Dukovany within a single year--for example, on 27 June 1993 in 
Block 2, as a result of a major operational fault, or on 29 
September in Block 1 and on 29 October in Block 3, as a result 
of a sudden failure of two of the six main central cooling pumps. 
  However, the other "deviations" from normal operations with 
unchanged reactor output bore considerable risks. Some of them 
were classified by the Nuclear Safety Office as "dangerous" in 
retrospect. 
  --During a check, the high-pressure pump for the emergency 
water did not start at all, while, during another check, the 
electric engine for feeding the boron solution into the system, 
the lack of which might lead to a disaster in an emergency, ran 
in the wrong direction. 
  --Contrary to the opinion of the state safety experts, the 
fire in the hydrogen system on 11 January 1993 was initially 
presented as absolutely harmless by the Dukovany engineers. 
  The Dukovany plant, which has been operating since 1985, is 
quite obviously showing major signs of wear and tear so that its 
continued operation is possible only by accepting 
ever-increasing safety risks. 
<H5>  Lower Safety Standards? </H5>
  In its ultrasound checks in Block 2, the state office 
discovered cracks in the steel beneath the interior lining of 
the reactor vessel. Moreover, in one area, the inner lining of 
the reactor vessel no longer stuck to the ground material, which 
can lead to material tension and cracks. Yet, instead of 
repairing the defective material, which would cost considerable 
amounts of money, the inspectors in their annual report suggest 
a much cheaper solution: The quality defects, they wrote in 
their "recommendation," would be acceptable for the further 
operation of the reactor if "the safety criteria were 
overhauled"--that is to say, lowered. 
  Yet, as they stated themselves, the inspectors were unable 
to 
check the real state of the steel in the reactor vessel because 
of permanent defects in the ultrasound equipment.... 
  That the position of the reactor vessel in Dukovany's Block 
4 
is too angular as a result of obvious construction defects, that 
it deviates more than 100 percent from the applicable safety 
regulations, hardly seems to count anymore. Even in this case, 
the State Nuclear Safety Office regards the further operation as 
"acceptable until further notice," despite this grave defect. 
<H5>  Is Prague Playing a Wrong Game? </H5>
  For Rudi Anschober, Greens deputy from Upper Austria, this 
annual report of the Czech Nuclear Safety Office only provides 
the final proof that the Prague government is playing false: 
"All defects in the Czech nuclear reactors that we have pointed 
to have been confirmed in this secret report. Dukovany is a 
nuclear time bomb, only 35 km north of Austria's border. 
However, even we were surprised about the dramatic increase in 
the number of incidents last year. Dukovany has long since been 
fit for the scrap heap." 
  Yet, surprisingly, the secret report of the State Nuclear 
Safety Office supplies nuclear opponents with new ammunition 
against finishing Temelin. If the responsible district 
authority at Ceske Budejovice classifies the planned refitting 
of the Temelin reactors by the U.S. "Westinghouse" group as 
"essential," which is generally expected, then, in the view of 
the Nuclear Safety Office in Prague, the operators of the power 
plant also need a new construction license. 
<H5>  Illegal Building Site Temelin </H5>
  With this view, the secret report indirectly supports 
Temelin 
opponents in the Czech Republic and abroad, for whom Temelin has 
been "the world's largest illegal building site" (Anschober) for 
some time. 
  The new construction licensing procedure might then mean the 
ultimate end for Temelin at the very last minute. Within the 
next few weeks, with their signature, at least 100,000 Austrians 
should therefore, as a precautionary measure, claim their right 
to speak out in the hearing regarding the construction of the 
missing blocks of the Temelin plant at the district office at 
Ceske Budejovice. 
  Despite all denials from Prague, the Czech Government is 
planning a massive extension of its nuclear program. At the 
moment, another licensing procedure is under way for a temporary 
storage plant for fuel rods not far from the Dukovany power 
plant, which would create an internationally unparalleled 
concentration of risk in this area. The Czech Nuclear Safety 
Office has not authorized this project because of planning 
mistakes. 
  According to the secret report, a separate fuel rod plant is 
also being planned, which would ultimately make the Czech 
Republic the number-one nuclear nation in East Europe.

  [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd arrived today 
for a two-day visit to the Czech Republic. He met Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus in the late afternoon. Lucie Weissova has 
more details. 
  [Weissova] After the meeting, Douglas Hurd told journalists 
that the talks dealt with Europe's future, with the expansion of 
European institutions, in particular the European Union and the 
North Atlantic Alliance. The two politicians agreed that a 
unified Europe should not become a superstate with Brussels as 
its capital. Rather, it should be a union of independent states 
that should be helped by this organization in efficient 
cooperation. 
  Vaclav Klaus handed the British foreign secretary a personal 
letter inviting Prime Minister John Major to visit the Czech 
Republic. 
  Responding to a question as to whether the Czech Republic 
could become a member of the European Union before the year 
2000, Douglas Hurd said: 
  [Begin Hurd recording in English with superimposed Czech 
translation] That is up to you. You initiate and you choose 
gradual steps. The debate and the negotiations will follow. I 
can only say that it is well possible. However, the initiative 
rests with you. [end recording] 
  [Weissova] According to Vaclav Klaus, the Czech Republic 
will 
certainly submit the European Union membership application 
before 1996, when the EU conference on institutional reform will 
take place.

  [Text] In conclusion of his two-day visit to the Czech 
Republic, UK Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has met with his 
Czech counterpart Josef Zieleniec. Klara Stejskalova reports: 
  [Stejskalova] The talks between the foreign ministers 
chiefly 
concerned the Czech Republic's membership in the European 
economic and security structures. Minister Zieleniec praised 
Britain's role in involving the countries of Central Europe in 
the European Union. At the same time, he stressed that we are 
striving for membership not because we want to be recipients of 
European aid but because we want to contribute to transformation 
using our own funds. According to Hurd, the European Union must 
grow gradually, on the basis of agreements that have already 
been concluded. 
  The talks also concerned NATO and the Partnership for Peace 
program. The two ministers praised the role of the United 
States, saying that its military presence in Europe is the 
guarantee of stability and that it has played an important part 
in the recent changes in Central Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by "(ce)": "The Government Assesses Last Year's </F>
Economic Development as Successful"] 
  [Text] Prague--The government considers last year's 
economic development in the Czech Republic to have been 
successful. It states this in the draft state closing account 
for 1993 that it has submitted to parliament. It considers 
price stabilization to be an important feature of economic 
development. The level of inflation measured by the consumer 
price index was 20.8 percent last year, 8.0 percent of which can 
be ascribed to tax reform. During the year, the prices of 
foodstuffs increased by 13.2 percent, nonfoodstuffs by 18 
percent, public catering by 21.9 percent, and services by 25.3 
percent. 
  The productivity of labor rose for the first time since the 
start of transformation--by 2.4 percent compared with 1992. It 
has not changed much in large organizations; it has increased by 
just under 25 percent in small organizations, and it declined by 
12.2 percent in construction. 
  The decline in unemployment halted in May, and the number of 
people out of work began to go up in June. At the end of the 
year, there were 185,000 people out of work, 50,000 more than in 
1992. The average period of unemployment was 4.6 months. At the 
end of 1993, 4,954,000 people were working in the national 
economy--that is, 17,000 fewer than the previous year. The 
structure of employment has changed, however. The labor force 
in industry and agriculture gradually transferred to 
construction and services. Some 7 percent were employed in 
agriculture and forestry and 34.4 percent in industry. The 
50-percent boundary was exceeded in services for the first time. 
Some 45.5 percent were employed in the private sector, which 
was more than in state and local organizations. 
  The population's real income rose by 5.6 percent, while its 
nominal income rose by 27.6 percent. The government forestalled 
extreme wage development (by 32.7 percent in June compared with 
1992) by wage regulation. 
  The closing account showed income amounting to 358 billion 
korunas [Kc] and expenditure amounting to Kc356.9 billion. That 
is, it ended with a surplus of more than Kc1 billion. The 
government proposes that Kc200 million be used to support small 
and medium-sized business, especially in the Bruntal, Louny, 
Novy Jicin, and Znojmo Districts. The sum of Kc87 million should 
be transferred to the North Bohemia Mines shareholding company 
to repay the credit for removing the overburden, Kc340 million 
should go toward establishing a system for administering and 
supervising the Czech Republic's taxes and duties, and Kc454 
million should go toward boosting the reserves for dealing with 
social problems.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "News From Home" column: "The </F>
Balance of the Clearing Account With the Slovak Republic Has 
Fundamentally Changed"] 
  [Text] Prague--The balance of foreign trade with 
Slovakia's clearing account fell in April from 2.067 billion 
korunas to 391.373 million korunas. This has been announced by 
Ondrej Kvacek of the Czech National Bank Public Relations 
Department. The figure of more than 391 million korunas 
approximately equals 11.5 million ECU's, which is less than a 
tenth of the permitted level of 130 million ECU's. During the 
year that this level has been in effect, it was exceeded 
twice--in December 1993 by 40.2 million ECU's and in January 
1994 by 46.1 million ECU's--and each time the Slovak party paid 
the difference in convertible currency in time.

  [Text] The contact group this evening held talks with 
Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic, Presidency member Ejup 
Ganic, and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. The contact group 
arrived in Sarajevo at around 2100, following talks with the 
aggressor Serb side in Pale. Members of the contact group 
comprising representatives of the United States, Russia, the 
European Union, Germany, Great Britain, and the United Nations 
will be staying in our country over the next two days. 
  Following the talks at the Presidency, U.S. President 
Clinton's special envoy Charles Redman said: We conducted 
exhaustive and serious talks this evening, and we heard the 
views of all the participants. Our job now is to study all 
these ideas and choose those that we will present to our 
governments and ministers, who will be meeting next week. 
  Let us now hear what Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President 
Alija Izetbegovic said after the talks with the contact group 
for Bosnia-Herzegovina: 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] We [word indistinct] told the 
contact group that, in our opinion, the prospects for peace have 
become more remote compared to the situation of 20 days ago. We 
believe that the behavior of UN officials--especially Mr. 
Akashi--has ruined the chances of a speedy restoration of peace 
that was (?in the offing). In fact, we have noticed that UN 
officials-- certain officials and especially Mr. Akashi--do not 
honor UN decisions, and the Serb side does not heed them because 
they do not respect their own resolutions. 
  That was obvious in the case of Sarajevo, and especially 
[passage indistinct] where heavy artillery is still within a 20 
km range. Especially, (?you know about) the incident today, an 
absurd incident when UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] helped 
chetnik tanks cross the Sarajevo exclusion zone to a new 
position in order to be able to attack us tomorrow in [word 
indistinct]. As you know, that was the reason why we demanded 
Mr. Akashi's resignation, because our government can no longer 
cooperate with him after all these major mistakes that, let me 
repeat, we believe have ruined the realistic chances of a speedy 
restoration of peace. 
  Of course, we stressed once again to the working 
group--whose 
efforts we respect because they have come with the best 
intentions to do what they can here--we repeated that the 
conditions for peace are very simple: the preservation of a 
sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is, the preservation of its 
external borders and the return of the occupied areas. We want 
peace to be restored, and we are therefore open to negotiations 
under the conditions I have just stated. We do not deny the 
possibility to restore peace, and we are in favor of it. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Pale, 5 May (TANJUG) -- Representatives of the 
international "contact group" for former Bosnia-Herzegovina this 
evening wound up a second round of talks with the leadership of 
the republic of Srpska. Members of the group talked to republic 
of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic and assembly president 
Momcilo Krajisnik. Following the meeting the participants 
briefly talked with reporters, without disclosing any details. 
  "We talked with Mr. Karadzic and his team and now we are 
first going to Sarajevo and then to our capitals to report on 
the results of the talks," said French diplomat Jacques-Alain de 
Sedouy, the representative of the European Union in the contact 
group. Asked about the specific results of today's meeting, de 
Sedouy replied that the group's members would submit a report 
about this to their governments. Republic of Srpska assembly 
president Momcilo Krajisnik said that the day is still far away 
when it will be possible to express optimism, but he stressed 
that today's talks were "very useful." 
  "We exchanged opinions and proposals, and these issues 
certainly deserve a thorough debate. The leadership of the 
republic of Srpska will have detailed consultations about all 
issues. We still believe that the talks is a way to find a 
solution to the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," Krajisnik 
said. 
  The contact group, which is trying to revive the peace 
process for former Bosnia-Herzegovina in Pale, consists of U.S. 
envoy Charles Redman, Russian envoy Aleksey Nikiforov, European 
Union representative de Sedouy, UN representative Paul Saso, 
Germany's Michael Steiner, and Great Britain's David Manning.

  [Text] The presidential council of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna confirmed today that talks between Croat and 
Bosnian Muslim representatives will resume in Vienna Saturday. 
They will talk about the implementation of the Washington 
agreement. Zdenko Vranjes reports from Mostar: 
  [Vranjes] They will talk about territorial demarcation and 
the appointment of top-level officials in the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
federation, the Presidential Council announced. The delegation 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats at the talks will include Kresimir 
Zubak, president of the Presidential Council; Mile Akmadzic, 
minister for interrepublican cooperation of the Croat republic 
of Herzeg-Bosna; Zoran Buntic, chairman of the Legislative 
Council; and Ante Markotic, head of the expert commission for 
cantonal demarcation and formulation of the principles of the 
federation's territorial organization. 
  Kresimir Zubak sent a letter to Haris Silajdzic. In it he 
tells Silajdzic that the Bosnian representatives from Vares 
municipality on the subcommittee for implementation of the 
Washington agreement are obstructing implementation of the 
agreement in this area. Zubak demands that Silajdzic exert his 
influence on the Bosnian side so that they, too, will implement 
the agreement at municipal level.

  [Text] Concerning yesterday's passage by two chetnik tanks 
on the Pale-Mt. Trebevic-Trnovo direction with the permission of 
and escorted by the UN Protection Force, Brigadier General Vahid 
Karavelic, commander of the 1st Corps, has issued the following 
statement. It reads as follows: 
  At the news conference General Rose said that this had been 
agreed between Akashi and war criminal Karadzic, and did not 
represent a violation of the cease-fire. The chetniks said that 
our offensive activities were in preparation on the Mt. Igman 
and Mt. Bjelasnica fronts and were therefore asking for 
permission to transfer the tanks. 
  [word indistinct] says that the chetniks could engage on 
these fronts forces of the strength of one division in order to 
divert the attention of the international public from the 
concentration of manpower and equipment around Brcko and Olovo. 
  Today at 1530 the chetniks issued orders to all the units in 
Trnovo to be at full combat readiness. This is said in the 
statement by Brigadier General Vahid Karavelic.

  [Text] While Kresimir Zubak was blaming the Muslim-Bosniak 
side for obstructing the Washington agreement, representatives 
of the Croat National Council [HNV] of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
stressed today at a news conference in Zagreb that the 
[Washington] agreement is being obstructed by those who have so 
far pursued the HDZ's [Croatian Democratic Union] policy toward 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosiljka Bucan reports. 
  [Bucan] As the HNV was one of the original initiators of the 
Washington agreement, it is our desire to have it materialized 
as soon as possible, [Franciscan] Brother Luka Markesic said on 
behalf of the HNV. He went on to explain this. 
  [Begin Markesic recording] The Washington agreement is the 
true articulation of the political will of the Croatian people 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a realistic political alternative 
to the carving up of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the war and ethnic 
cleansing there, the so-called humane resettlement, and the 
persecution of people. This is, after all, common knowledge. 
  This is why this agreement was welcomed with so much joy and 
why our people have immediately embraced it. I can really speak 
for our people as a whole. [end recording] 
  [Bucan] Yet, Brother Luka Markesic added, we are coming 
across attempts to obstruct it. This is why we believe that it 
cannot be implemented by those same people who until yesterday 
opposed the unity of Croats and Muslim-Bosniaks and an 
indivisible and united Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this sense, he 
sharply criticized the HDZ leadership of this republic. 
  Speaking about some other issues raised at the conference, 
he 
mentioned Bosanska Posavina and the Serb corridor through this 
area. 
  [Begin Markesic recording] We want once again to express our 
determination and resolve to oppose the corridor through 
Bosanska Posavina. [end recording] 
  [Bucan] Our reasoning is simple. The corridor only supports 
the materialization of greater-Serbian policies. Brother Luka 
Markesic also said there is only symbolic care for the return of 
refugees. He therefore demanded that the HNV's work and 
activities be given more coverage in the Croat media.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mile Akmadzic, minister for interrepublican </F>
cooperation and interethnic relations in the government of the 
Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna and vice president of the 
Croatian Democratic Community of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Ivan 
Sabic; place and date not given: "Talks Are Running Quite 
Successfully"] 
  [Text] Mile Akmadzic, minister for interrepublican 
cooperation and interethnic relations in the government of the 
Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna and vice president of the 
Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is 
quite an interesting person to interview at present because he 
is one of the participants in the Croatian-Bosniak negotiations 
on the implementation of the federal constitution, which, 
despite initial optimism, are not proceeding at the planned 
pace. Hence our first question. 
  [Sabic] Is the Washington Agreement perhaps being sabotaged? 
  [Akmadzic] It is obvious that we will not be able to meet 
all the envisaged deadlines, but I do not think that the 
Washington Agreement is being sabotaged. There are simply still 
too large differences in the views on some issues and we need 
time to bring these views closer. 
  [Sabic] Why has the Bosniak side persisted with the 
nomination of Alija Izetbegovic, even after the Croatian side 
made a major concession by withdrawing the nomination of Mr. 
Zubak? 
  [Akmadzic] The Bosniaks hold the view that because their 
people have experienced the greatest suffering, they have the 
moral right to have their man as the head of the federation 
first. They claim that Mr. Izetbegovic enjoy enormous trust 
among his people, while our argument is that his second term of 
office had already expired in 1992 and that, according to the 
rotation system, it is now the turn of a Croat, and that since 
the setting up of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1974, 
the Croats have held this post for only three years. In our 
view. Mr. Izetbegovic also bears certain political 
responsibility for the people's lack of readiness to defend 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. I nevertheless believe that reason will 
prevail, that both sides will still think it over and that we 
will reach an agreement. 
<H5>  We Need To Create a Climate of Trust </H5>
  [Sabic] Nevertheless, some things appear to have been agreed 
on successfully. 
  [Akmadzic] The talks are actually running quite 
successfully. We have achieved peace, people are moving freely, 
we have reached a very important agreement of the government of 
the future federation, on the ministries and departments that 
will work for the government. We have also reached agreements on 
regulating imports and exports, the transit of goods within the 
federation, setting up of telecommunication links, and the 
supply of electric power. Prisoners have been exchanged. True, 
there are still a number of misunderstandings, but these are 
gradually being eliminated. We have agreed on the pace of 
return of the refugees and the evicted and displaced persons. 
The election of the leading people of the federation is the key 
issue, because it encroaches directly on the equality of the 
peoples. However, I think that it is more important at present 
to talk about what we have achieved. We need to create a 
climate of trust, as stipulated by the joint declaration that 
was signed by Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic in September 
last year. 
  [Sabic] It is often said that an agreement on the leaders 
cannot be achieved without the intervention of the 
representatives of the United States, without those who mediated 
in the signing of the agreement? 
  [Akmadzic] I do no think that we will be forced to seek the 
help of the United States or anyone else to solve the leadership 
issue. We simply must resolve this ourselves. The issue of 
electing the first president of the federation is difficult, but 
once this has been resolved, the rest will be considerably 
easier. 
  [Sabic] What are the arguments of the Bosniak side against 
the election of Mr. Zubak? 
  [Akmadzic] The Bosniak side is presenting arguments in favor 
of its candidate, but is not interfering in the nomination of 
our candidate. This is what was agreed in principle and applies 
to all candidates. Therefore, the Bosniak side has not 
presented any arguments against Mr. Zubak personally. 
  [Sabic] The statements made by some Bosniak officials give 
the impression that, despite the fact that the constitution of 
the federation is very clear, an attempt is being made to secure 
some advantage for the more numerous nation. 
  [Akmadzic] The constitution of the federation does not go 
into the size of individual nations. We do know that the Muslim 
nation is considerably more numerous and therefore we do not 
demand parity at all levels, but only in the leadership, where 
the equality of the peoples is reflected. The size of the 
nation "argument" has appeared among the Bosniaks, but this has 
never affected the talks directly. The United Nations does not 
recognize factors such as the size of a nation nor the size of a 
country. 
  [Sabic] There are some fears in the public that the 
agreement could be seriously affected as a whole if no agreement 
is reached on the leader of the future state. Was there any 
indication of that during the talks? 
  [Akmadzic] So far, the agreement and the implementation of 
the federal constitution have never been brought into question 
for a minute. We have some objections regarding the release of 
prisoners, we demand greater flexibility in the election of 
leading people, we demand that the media campaign calm down, 
especially in Mostar, and we demand that they themselves remove 
those individuals who are against the constitution. I think 
that in this respect we are making more resolute moves than the 
Bosniaks. 
<H5>  Ethnic Criterion Is Main, But Not Only Criterion </H5>
  [Sabic] Regarding the removal of the individuals who oppose 
the constitution, one should also mention that the Bosniak side 
claims that in the Croatian leadership there are those who are 
responsible for crimes and that they cannot be involved in the 
implementation of the agreement. 
  [Akmadzic] We agreed that the representatives of both 
nations, each one in its own house, clear this problem, that we 
do not accuse each other, and then, when we finish this, see 
what to do next. 
  [Sabic] Is this agreement respected? 
  [Akmadzic] Yes, it is at present. However, neither side has 
carried out the necessary investigation as yet, and therefore we 
do not have enough information of the conduct of responsible 
persons at all levels, but know what the situation is in the 
leadership. 
  [Sabic] How is the work on setting up cantons going on? 
There is a mention of great opposition by the Bosniak side to 
the cantons being based on the ethnic criterion? 
  [Akmadzic] The federal constitution clearly states that the 
federation will be made up of federal units and that these units 
will not bear national attributes in their names. The federal 
law will regulate the methods and ways of determining cantonal 
borders, whereby the ethnic criterion will be the main, but not 
the only criterion. We have already asked our representatives 
in the expert team to establish detailed criteria. At our 
recent meeting in Sarajevo we jointly concluded that this work 
should be speeded up. 
  [Sabic] In some parts of the free territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, such as Mostar and Travnik, there are a 
large number of Muslims who were expelled from the parts of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina currently occupied by the Serbs. Will their 
presence have any influence on the borders of the cantons. They 
are not foreign citizens and many of them have been issued 
personal documents in these new places of abode. 
  [Akmadzic] The constitution is taking into account the 
results of the last census. We have agreed with the Bosniak 
side, and we have also said this to the international community, 
that all refugees and displaced persons must return to the 
places they had to flee from. We spoke to the Bosniak side 
about this at length and agreed that if the refugees, if they 
cannot return to the parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina under Serbian 
control, should go to the cantons in which their nation 
constitutes a majority. However, there will be no forced 
eviction from any region, nor forced return of refugees. 
<H5>  It Is Not Time for Politicking </H5>
  [Sabic] Can a process similar to the one taking place in the 
HDZ of Croatia be expected in the HDZ of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
Some HDZ deputies in the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina have 
allegedly been preparing the founding of a new party? 
  [Akmadzic] It is understandable that events in Croatia most 
directly affect the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croats 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina are already organized in several political 
parties, which is good. It is a known fact that the HDZ is the 
strongest party among them, that it has practically won all 
Croat votes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, unanimity cannot 
reign in the HDZ either, which is also good. Differences in 
views do exist, but the majority of the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly those in the HDZ, want the war 
to stop and the federal constitution implemented. This is in 
the interest of us as a nation and not as a party. I do not 
know whether anyone will decide to form a new party for one 
reason or the other, but if he does, I do not think that this 
will affect the HDZ much. No one has ever been ruined because 
someone else has become strong, but because he has become weak. 
I think that this is not the time for politicking. This 
generation of Croats has the task and the opportunity, after 900 
years, to create and preserve a Croatian state and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is also the state of the Croatian 
people. 
  [Sabic] How many HDZ deputies are, presently, three and half 
years after the elections, willing to carry through the party 
policies? How many votes can you count on with certainty? 
  [Akmadzic] The Croats have a total of 49 deputies in the 
Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of these, 44 have been elected 
as HDZ candidates. A great majority of them voted for the 
federal constitution, which contains fundamental principles of 
our policy, which means that they support the policy of the HDZ. 
We also count on this political orientation in the future. 
There used to be some misunderstandings about the existence of 
Herzeg-Bosna, allegedly ambiguous attitudes toward the Muslims 
people, and about relations among the Croats who live in the 
parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina where they constitute a majority and 
those in their regions where they are a minority. Some of these 
problems will be solved with the implementation of the federal 
constitution. We will find out what people really think only at 
the next elections. I personally believe that the people will 
again extend their support to the HDZ.

  [Text] We were hoping that this evening we would discuss 
the continuation of the peace process with the contact group -- 
[word indistinct] that the chetniks would have withdrawn from 
Gorazde in accordance with the ultimatum. This was stated today 
by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. 
Unfortunately the chetniks have not withdrawn. Second, it is 
(unacceptable) that the United Nations should make arrangements 
with the aggressor's representatives, and help them transport 
their tanks from one location to another so that they can go on 
killing civilians somewhere else. That is why we will demand 
today that Yasushi Akashi tenders his resignation, Haris 
Silajdzic added. The decision to demand Akashi's resignation 
was made today at the session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency. This demand will be presented to the contact group, 
which is to arrive in Sarajevo this evening to revive the peace 
process.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, May 5 (AFP) -- UN officials 
acknowledged Thursday [5 May] that they let Serb tanks violate 
the heavy arms exclusion zone around Sarajevo, drawing sharp 
protests from the Bosnian Government and undermining a new 
international peace conference. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile Akashi and his principle commanders on the ground 
met Thursday afternoon with senior NATO officials in Zagreb, 
according to UNPROFOR sources in the Croatian capital. The 
officials included Sergio Balanzino, deputy NATO secretary 
general and U.S. General George Joulwan, commander in chief of 
Allied forces in Europe. The meeting was held at Akashi's 
initiative. UNPROFOR generals Bertrand de Lapresle and Sir 
Michael Rose were also attending. 
  According to NATO sources in Brussels, the talks were due to 
discuss recent violations of the NATO ultimatums in Bosnia. 
They came one day after the UN Security Council warned of the 
serious consequences of fighting around Brcko. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 6 -- The United Nations Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) will stop two Serb tanks from crossing the 
military exclusion zone around Sarajevo Friday, UNPROFOR 
announced. The transit of the tanks -- the last of a total 
seven scheduled to cross the zone between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 
p.m. (1200 and 1300 GMT) -- had been announced earlier Friday by 
a UNPROFOR spokesman. But a military UNPROFOR spokesman who 
refused to be identified said orders were given by the Bosnia 
UNPROFOR command to block the tanks.

  [Text] The latest expulsion of the non-Serb population 
from Banja Luka and other Krajina municipalities is yet another 
illustration of the brutality and the insanity of the policy of 
violence conducted by war criminal Karadzic and his followers. 
This is contained in a statement issued today by the Serbian 
Citizens' Council. At their assembly held on 27 March of this 
year, citizens of Serbian nationality and Serbian ethnic origin 
again sent a clear message to the international community, 
explaining that the theory of the impossibility of coexistence 
in fact conceals the aggressor's aspirations to occupy territory 
and expel Bosniak Muslims from their homes. 
  For this reason we demand from all those responsible 
international subjects that can influence the course of solving 
the bloody Bosnia-Herzegovina drama to prevent further 
expulsions of Muslims and Croats from their homes, and to create 
the conditions for a speedy return of refugees and displaced 
people. This, in our view, is the precondition for peace in 
this region, reads the statement by the Serbian Citizens' 
Council.

  [Text] Brcko, 5 May (TANJUG) -- Seven UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] observers will monitor the confrontations at 
the Brcko front from Saturday, 7 May. They will be joined by 
another nine UNPROFOR members on Sunday. This is the result of 
the talks held today between Sergio de Mello, the UN deputy 
special envoy for civilian affairs and Nikola Koljevic, the 
vice-president of the Bosnian Serb Republic. The military 
delegations were led by Dutch Colonel Jup and commander of the 
[Serbian] East Bosnia Corps Gen Novica Simic. 
  The observers on the Serb side will be deployed at four 
points in Brcko and will be able to communicate with their 
fellow observers who will be deployed on the Muslim side. Our 
main objective is to prevent confrontations around Brcko and, 
following the Gorazde crisis, to prevent crises in general, 
Sergio de Mello told reporters. We want to show that we do not 
want war and that everything can be resolved through political 
negotiation, Koljevic said. 
  The result of the talks today was also that the commander of 
the [Serbian] East-Bosnia Corps Maj-Gen Novica Simic and the 
commander of the [Muslim] Second Corps Nazim Sadic will most 
probably meet soon. 
  They will try to agree on a cease-fire, to put into practice 
the agreement reached by Radovan Karadzic and Yasushi Akashi, it 
was said at the press conference. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] While world attention has been focused 
on developments around the UN-proclaimed safe area of Gorazde, 
Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat political leaders have been 
engaged in negotiations to fill leadership positions in their 
newly established federation. The deadline for electing the 
federation's government is drawing near: According to the 
federation's constitution, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly is 
supposed to reach a decision by 30 April at the latest. 
  Following three meetings of high-ranking representatives of 
the Bosnian Muslim and Croat sides, the Presidential Council of 
the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna blamed the Bosnian Muslims 
for a failure to reach a political agreement on the nationality 
of the federation's future president, vice president, and prime 
minister, accusing the Muslims of an "absolute lack of interest 
and readiness" to discuss these issues, Zagreb Radio reported on 
26 April. 
  Describing a 23 April "working meeting" between Bosnian 
Croat 
and Muslim delegations in Sarajevo, the Belgrade news agency 
TANJUG stated the same day that the two sides had failed to 
reach an agreement on the future federation president. Citing a 
Croatian Radio report, TANJUG said that each side had given 
"legal and political" justifications for its candidate. Although 
the Croat side wanted a Croat as the first president of the 
federation, it was prepared to yield to the Muslims on the 
condition that Haris Silajdzic were nominated instead of the 
proposed Muslim leader, Alija Izetbegovic. Izetbegovic, 
president of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was proposed as candidate for 
federation president by "deputies of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Assembly" and by the regional, executive, and main committees of 
the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] on 8 April, which cited 
"moral and political reasons that are clear to all members and 
supporters of our party," according to Sarajevo Radio on 12 
April. 
  The Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and the Croatian deputies' club in the Assembly have put forward 
as their presidential candidate Kresimir Zubak, chairman of the 
Presidency of the Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna. In an 
interview published in the 2-4 April issue of the Zagreb daily 
VECERNJI LIST, Zubak said that "we have not only a political, 
but also a constitutional right" to elect a Croat to the post of 
president because, according to the constitution, the president 
cannot be elected from the same people twice in succession, and 
"over the past several years this function has been performed by 
a member of the Muslim people, namely Alija Izetbegovic." 
  The Croatian National Council [HNV] of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
has 
nominated Dr. Ivo Komsic as its presidential candidate. 
According to a statement published in the 15 April issue of the 
Zagreb daily VJESNIK, Dr. Komsic has met every criterion for 
"election to this most responsible post" and has proven his 
determination, ability, and readiness "to implement the spirit 
and the letter of the new constitution" with his "overall work 
and personal contribution" in preparing the Washington agreement 
and later the constitution. 
  An article in the 5 April issue of the Belgrade daily BORBA 
observes that Bosnian reporters accredited to Zagreb see 
Kresimir Zubak as Croatian President Tudjman's choice for 
president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, adding that at 
the same time "the government in Zagreb does not oppose Haris 
Silajdzic in some leadership position." The BORBA article also 
mentions other presidential candidates whose names are 
circulating in Sarajevo, such as Komsic, Vlado Pandzic, and 
Stjepan Kljuic, noting that their political views on the future 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina are supposed to be closer to Croatian 
Assembly President Stipe Mesic's than to Tudjman's. 
  A 13 April VJESNIK article points out that, in accordance 
with the constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, the 
federation president cannot be chosen by the "simple process" of 
the Assembly voting on nominated candidates. The governments of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Herceg-Bosna must agree upon a single 
candidate to be presented to the Assembly. To be elected, the 
candidate must then get the majority of votes of both the Croat 
and Bosnian Muslim representatives. The paper predicts that such 
an election will "obviously" entail difficulties.

  [Excerpt] Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, and U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith have 
signed an agreement at the Foreign Ministry between the 
governments of the Republic of Croatia and the United States on 
economic, technical, and related aid. Tihomir Vinkovic has this 
report. 
  [Vinkovic] Prior to signing the agreement Minister Granic 
said that this agreement is of major political and economic 
significance for the Republic of Croatia. This is an 
all-encompassing agreement and serves as a basis for all other 
specific agreements, Minister Granic said, adding that this is 
the cornerstone of future cooperation between the United States 
and the Republic of Croatia. Minister Granic stressed that such 
agreements are signed only with countries that have developed 
friendly relations with the United States and which the United 
States wishes to help. In any case, following the signing of 
the Washington agreement and the meeting between Presidents 
Clinton and Tudjman, this represents the most important instance 
in the development of friendly relations between the United 
States and the Republic of Croatia, Minister Granic said. 
  He expressed his hope that talks on concrete projects will 
continue and that specific agreements on cooperation between the 
United States and the Republic of Croatia will be signed over 
the next couple of months. 
  Minister Granic thanked the U.S. Government, which reacted 
swiftly after the signing of the Washington agreement and signed 
today's agreement. 
  U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith expressed his 
satisfaction with his signing of today's agreement on behalf of 
the United States. This general agreement provides a framework 
for extending U.S. aid to the whole world, including Croatia, 
Galbraith said. He added that bilateral relations between the 
United States and Croatia will develop on the basis of genuine 
partnership and consultation. This agreement will place U.S. 
know-how and experience at the disposal of Croatian public and 
nongovernmental organizations, Galbraith said. [passage omitted]

Start"] 
  [Text] Upon his return from New York and Brussels, 
Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski refuted any reports of an 
alleged "Vance plan" for resolving the Greek-Macedonian dispute. 
"We have worked together these past few weeks with Cyrus Vance 
and Matthew Nemitz on a possible solution for the dispute, but 
no final agreement has been reached thus far," Crvenkovski 
stated. "We expect the second phase of the negotiations to 
start in about 10 days or to reach some kind of an agreement in 
the meantime." He expressed hope Cyrus Vance's efforts would 
eventually result in reviving of the talks. 
  In regard to his meetings with various U.S. officials, 
Crvenkovski said they have shown clear support of the 
independence and territorial integrity of Macedonia and all that 
is achieved by this small state in the course of the past two 
years. He also pointed out the entire media in the United 
States wrote in favor of Macedonia during his visit, condemning 
at the same time the Greek embargo and behavior. 
  He said his meeting with the Western European Union 
President 
[WEU] van Ekkelen proved very useful. Besides discussing the 
situation in the region, they have agreed in principle to 
establish various kinds of cooperation between the WEU and 
Macedonia.

<F P=106> [Report by K.C.: "The Census -- An Act of Great National </F>
Interest"] 
  [Text] Today's 75th session of the People's Assembly of 
the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] is very important because it will review the 
proposal on the census, an act of great national interest. 
Adoption of the census document will help throw light on a 
number of dilemmas and the confusion that is constantly being 
spread by various circles, as new instruments endangering the 
internal stability of our country, with the intention of 
threatening the Republic of Macedonia. It will silence the 
stories and presentations about the size of some nationalities 
in the state. Holding a census is the only way to remove such 
declarations in a civilized way, and this time it is also 
supported by the international community. 
  This, among other things, was what Stojan Andov, chairman of 
the Assembly, emphasized at yesterday's news conference on the 
occasion of the draft proposal on the 1994 census on population, 
households, apartments, and farms, which is to be discussed by 
the delegates at today's 75th session. Underlining the 
importance of the census, Andov pointed out that the 
verification of the law and the holding of the census had the 
power of the referendum held in Macedonia in 1991. The national 
interest in the census, the Assembly chairman noted, extended 
beyond any party interest in scoring points among the public. 
That is why obstruction of the census would mean keeping "alive 
and active" all the confusion about the supposed structure of 
the population. 
  "It is very important," Andov underlined, "to create a 
different atmosphere in the Assembly today, an atmosphere that 
will coincide with the task that the legislature has to do. If 
the situation in the Assembly is not changed" -- by which he 
meant the interrupted 74th session on the election laws and the 
tumultuous discussion about the census document at a previous 
stage -- "it will mean there is a lack of awareness about the 
state's real interest." Chairman Andov also appealed to the 
parliamentarians to apply themselves and adopt the law so that 
the census can be carried out soon. At the same time he hinted 
that the new parliamentary session, scheduled at the 
government's request, could be a very tiring and difficult one 
if parliament did not show readiness to carry out its duties. 
  In that context it was stressed that it was unacceptable for 
people to use the census issue for such party ploys as were 
witnessed during the initial discussions on the census, in which 
everyone tries to prove his love for his own people, nation, or 
nationality, or how much he strives for Macedonia and its 
democracy. Parliament should be skilled enough to perform the 
duties of an executive body in the remaining months of its 
mandate, as it has done so many times before in appropriately 
adopting the right acts in conditions in which the atmosphere in 
the state was extremely tense. He said this was necessary in 
order to register the moment of maturity as an important 
milestone in the stability of the state of the Republic of 
Macedonia tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Article by Panta Dzambazoski: "Ethnic or Civil Sentences"] </F>
  [Text] There have been a lot of police interventions 
in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] 
that have been unnecessarily politicized and turned into 
scandals; why the police are being accused of "ethnic 
selectivity" by both Macedonians and Albanians and Serbs.... 
  Ever since several political parties have been functioning 
in 
Macedonian political life, some of the parties have been 
constantly obsessed with the police. The parties try to 
interpret in their own way any significant action by the police. 
The national parties in the Macedonian bloc, especially 
VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Democratic Party of Macedonian National Unity], are 
"diligent" in this regard, as well as the Albanians' parties, 
the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] and the NDP [National 
Democratic Party]. In the past they have frequently demanded the 
resignation of the minister of internal affairs. Is it just 
because Macedonia is in a period of transition, because of the 
incomplete transformation of the police, or because of the 
stance of the parties which represent "their people" that we 
have so many incidents, and scandals, behind us? Or, to put it 
more simply, are political circles trying to clarify police 
actions that have already been carried out? 
  Radolista, the Bit Market, the "All-Albanian Army," then 
Djordje Petrov, Kuklis, the Veles trial, Blue Bird, Duvlo, and 
finally, Kuceviste, and so forth, are cases of action by the 
police that were interpreted differently by the parties, and 
after which there were demands that the head of the police be 
held accountable. The issue of exceeding authority was always 
raised. 
<H5>  When One Has the Same Standard... </H5>
  When 860 policemen entered the village of Radoliste in 1992, 
on the basis of previous indications about the possible 
organization of paramilitary formations, the police were fired 
upon from several directions and from several houses. Even 
before this operation, the police had discovered in the same 
village, in one development in Struga, as well as in Feriste, 
eight rifles (four automatic rifles and one sniper rifle), 12 
pistols, ammunition, 1.6 kilograms of explosives, capsules and 
slow-burning fuses, 12 gas masks, five pairs of binoculars, and 
two camouflage uniforms, and 33 people were arrested, three of 
whom were Albanian citizens. The police thus had grounds for 
suspicion. The PDP, however, is speaking out in connection with 
the case, demanding information about the incident, and noting 
that the increased police presence is unjustified; the entire 
course of events is being focused on what has already been 
heard--that the police are conducting operations to intimidate 
and put pressure on the Albanians, and trying to portray them as 
terrorists, and in this context, they are allegedly trying to 
portray the PDP that way as well. 
  Precisely these words were uttered recently when the police 
arrested several Albanians who were found to be in illegal 
possession of weapons. The charges filed refer to article 218 of 
the Criminal Code--the illegal possession of weapons and 
explosives. That in itself indicates that the latest arrests do 
not have any connection (at least not according to the 
statements made to date) with the arrest of the people accused 
of Albanian paramilitary organization and of the creation of an 
All-Albanian Army in Macedonia. The PDP and NDP, however, are 
insisting precisely on that connection, and they are trying to 
politicize the trial and portray it as a political one. The 
Albanian deputies in the Tetovo Assembly are even putting the 
latest case on the agenda (!), demanding that the people 
arrested be released! Is this a matter of hasty conclusions, 
pressure upon the Interior Ministry for more selective actions, 
or even an attempt to persuade international factors that the 
Albanians in Macedonia are, allegedly, in danger? 
  In the past, however, other citizens have also been held 
accountable under that same article 218, and not just Albanians. 
  In that same year, 1992, Krum Cuskov and his son Goce 
Cuskov, 
as well as Djordji Kalauzarov and Petre Konevski (all from Titov 
Veles) and Zarko Petrusev and Stojce Delevski from Tetovo, were 
jailed because of grounds to suspect that they had committed a 
crime under the same article 218. The defendants from Titov 
Veles were charged with nine explosions that took place in the 
city from 1989 to April 1992. The two defendants from Tetovo, 
along with the Veles group, were planning to blow up the PDP and 
NDP headquarters in Tetovo. It was precisely in order to prevent 
that planned bombing that the police stopped pretending that 
they were "naive," in order to "close the net" around other 
"bombers" who were possibly involved. (Two more people were 
later arrested, however.) The court later sentenced them to 
prison. The "bombers" were members of VMRO-DPMNE, and Kalauzarov 
was even secretary of the municipal committee. The party 
disassociated itself from the defendants, while nevertheless not 
neglecting to say that it was an action at the wrong time and in 
the wrong place. Then, however, "chief" Nikola Veljanovski from 
Ohrid was to say that the people involved in the Veles trial 
were members of VMRO's Defense Committee, which had also issued 
a death sentence against VMRO-DPMNE leader Ljupco Georgievski. 
  A few months ago, an individual who had "several weapons" 
was 
arrested at the Tetovo bus station. The defendant was a Serb by 
nationality. That time the PDP and NDP kept quiet. 
<H5>  Should the Police "Boast"? </H5>
  The police can also "boast" of their actions in the Bit 
Market, when there was an armed conflict with a large number of 
Albanian citizens; of their supervision of a number of suspects 
in the Albanians' rally in the Skopje square, when a map of "the 
political and territorial autonomy of Albanians in Macedonia" 
was presented, and when the propaganda material that several 
citizens, who turned out to be relatives of deputy Mersim 
Polozani, brought with them to Skopje, was controlled without 
the use of force. 
  The police can likewise boast of the better-known actions in 
Kuklis, when the VMRO-DPMNE went into the field with its 
prominent representatives, or in Djorce Petrov, when "the 
people" came out again, and the police utilized repression, a 
case which was likewise politicized by the Macedonian national 
parties. Skopje's Montenegro, or more precisely the village of 
Kuceviste, is a place where there have been incidents with the 
police several times to date, in which the participants were 
citizens who were Serbs by nationality. The Democratic Party of 
Serbs in Macedonia was the political factor which politicized 
the incidents and spread ideas about the Serbophobia of the 
Interior Ministry and the police's alleged ethnic selectivity 
along those lines. 
  The "Blue Bird" scandal considerably disturbed the public 
two 
years ago. VMRO-DPMNE responded that "The SDB [State Security 
Service] is using the perfidious insinuations of members of the 
party in order to discredit it and compromise it in the eyes of 
the public," and that "The members' ethnic identity is being 
misused." The resignations of state President Kiro Gligorov and 
Minister Ljubomir Frckovski were demanded, and it was also 
demanded that the government be held responsible. It actually 
had to do with a decision by VMRO-DPMNE's External Commission to 
form an ethnic army (the MNG [Macedonian National Guard] or 
guard), whose representatives were received at a high level in 
the Republic of Bulgaria, where assistance in the form of a 
10,000-strong army and special forces was promised. VMRO-DPMNE 
was informed, and the "guardsmen" swore their oaths in a church 
in Kuklis. The MNG's statute specified action only in the event 
of foreign aggression against Macedonia. The period of the MNG's 
creation coincided with the time of the withdrawal by the JNA 
[Yugoslav People's Army] from Macedonia (15 April 1992) and the 
establishment of the ARM [Army of the Republic of Macedonia]. 
Then contacts with the SDB and the ARM took place. There was no 
criminal prosecution of the "paramilitary troops," since, as 
Interior Ministry Under Secretary Slobodan Bogoevski stated 
then, "the guardsmen have resigned, they did not commit a crime, 
there is no basis for criminal charges," and "The SDB was 
obligated to accept the contacts that were offered." 
  Perhaps the unclear and "semi-informative" scandal will go 
down in the young state's history as a good-faith attempt by a 
"group of patriots" to fight for its independent, but the case 
has been profoundly politicized by VMRO-DPMNE. The fact that its 
closure happened from the moment of the ARM's formation cannot 
give the incident the same dimensions as the case of the 
"All-Albanian Army," which is just being clarified. According to 
the indictment, this has to do with actions that continued even 
after the JNA's departure from Macedonia, while possible actions 
during the JNA's presence are, in general, a mitigating 
circumstance. The statements by local national leaders from 
Bitola and Ohrid about the alleged "thousands of armed patriots" 
(paramilitary ones) are nothing more than advertising, at least 
according to official statements. 
  What is surely the essential thing, and a disturbing one at 
the same time, is that the idea that the police are against the 
people, or against the people "represented by" certain parties, 
is still being encouraged. If one goes by the reactions of the 
political parties, it turns out that the Interior Ministry 
authorities exist only for themselves, but are also against all 
citizens (depending on ethnic identity) in Macedonia. 
  Nevertheless, it is that way throughout the world--when 
public law and order is threatened security measures are taken, 
when necessary by means of repression as well. The illegal 
possession of weapons and explosives is punished, and everywhere 
terrorist actions have the same name and require sanctions. 
Different views are discussed, and any abuse of power is 
determined by the competent authorities.

<F P=106> [Article by Branko Geroski: "Formula for Useful </F>
Implications"] 
  [Text] The solutions for the selection and 
responsibilities of the heads of the new security structures, as 
the government is proposing them--through a sort of distribution 
of power--could prevent frequent changes and coups under 
conditions of political confusion in the cabinet and in the 
state leadership. 
  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] 
is the third of the former Yugoslav republics to embark upon a 
fundamental restructuring of the security system. So far it has 
only been done by Slovenia and Croatia. The announced separation 
of intelligence and counterintelligence functions into separate 
and relatively independent structures (the Intelligence Agency 
and the Directorate for Protection of the Constitutional Order) 
will create the institutional prerequisites for beginning a 
process of dispersion of the enormous real power that 
accumulates at the very top of the ministry. During the period 
of monism that power was not transparent, since the ministerial 
(at that time secretarial) armchair was reserved for quiet and 
obedient "soldiers," loyal to the state and party leadership. 
Later things changed, and today it is not by chance that it is 
thought that the head of the ministry is probably the most 
influential figure in the country after the three in the state 
leadership (the state president, the president of parliament, 
and the prime minister). 
  How will that power be distributed? The government, in the 
draft laws on internal affairs and the Intelligence Agency, is 
offering an interesting formula for the method of selection and 
dismissal of the directors of the Agency and the Directorate, 
and especially for the subordination of responsibility of these 
people and structures. As we know, the minister of internal 
affairs is selected by the Assembly, and he is answerable to the 
cabinet and in a specific way (the institution of 
interpellation) directly to the parliament. The director of the 
counterintelligence service (the Directorate) will be appointed 
and dismissed by the government, but at the proposal of the 
minister. Logically, he will thereby also be responsible to the 
latter. The author of the law is proposing that the head of the 
intelligence service (the Agency) be appointed and dismissed by 
the republic president, but subordination to the cabinet is also 
envisioned. The Agency will thus be responsible to the 
government, which will be able to demand accountability from its 
director. Furthermore, the head of the intelligence service will 
adopt regulations on the organization and systematization of 
jobs only with prior consent from the government. 
  There is no doubt that this formula is consistent with the 
spirit of the constitutionally (and realistically) established 
semipresidential system in Macedonia. A similar solution exists 
in Croatia, for example, where the counterintelligence service 
is part of the Interior Ministry, but the intelligence under the 
control of these services in all countries depends on the basic 
characteristics of the system. In "pure" parliamentary regimes, 
for instance, the members of the intelligence-security families 
are under the control of the governments and the corresponding 
ministries, and it is often the practice that their activities 
are coordinated by interministerial committees. 
  So far the solution offered by the government has not 
aroused 
any interest whatsoever on the part of parliament and the 
broader political public. It is symptomatic that only the idea 
arises somewhere in parliament and that the appointment and 
dismissal of the Directorate's director are to be under the 
jurisdiction of the head of state. To say the least, this is a 
surprising proposal. It would be natural for the deputies to 
fight to have that authority come either from their chamber or 
at least from the government that they elect. It might thus be 
logical that they would challenge a solution according to which 
the state president appoints and dismisses the director of the 
Intelligence Agency. 
  If the efforts of some deputies to establish direct 
subordination of the heads of these structures to parliament as 
well (parliamentary oversight is another matter) are perhaps an 
understandable, if not justified "reflex" on the part of the 
deputies, then the proposal that the head of state be given 
greater powers, of course, demonstrates a lack of understanding 
of the essence of the formula offered. It is not coincidental 
that the republic president's jurisdiction to appoint such an 
important figure in the security community is limited by the 
Agency's clearly defined subordination to the government. 
  Actually, the mutual limitations are the point of this 
solution. The formula is constructed in such a way that it 
complicates any possible attempts at rapid, ill-considered, and 
frequent changes of the people in leading positions at these 
services, all in a situation of disagreement or open conflicts 
within the government (between coalition partners, between the 
premier and individual ministers, and so forth), in cases of 
conflict between the government and the republic president, or 
possibly between the government and the minister of internal 
affairs. 
  Thus, for example, the government could hold the director of 
the Intelligence Agency responsible for a specific situation or 
occurrence, but that does not mean that the state president is 
obligated to accept it and dismiss that person. Conversely, if 
the president decides on such a step without or even against the 
will of the government, the latter, even if it does not block 
the selection, can at least hamper the functioning of the 
president's new protege. Or there is this situation: The 
minister can hold the director of the Directorate responsible, 
but the government does not have to decide to dismiss him. 
Conversely, if the government replaces the head of the 
counterintelligence service without the minister's consent, the 
latter can block the selection of a new director by dodging the 
obligation to propose a new candidate, or by proposing someone 
who will not suit his fellow cabinet members. 
  These complications are unnecessary at first glance, and 
even 
dangerous, but they are actually extremely useful, since if it 
were not for these "handles," it could easily happen, in the 
event of political infighting within the government or in the 
state leadership and, in general, in confused general political 
conditions, that confusing changes and coups in the leading 
positions of these services might also result. In that way the 
services could be utilized in political quarrels among coalition 
partners, and even induced to engage in unhealthy mutual 
competition. In the developed democratic world, such cases of 
quiet "wars" between a state's security services have been 
recorded, and they usually end with serious scandals with 
serious consequences for the state's security as well. It is 
precisely for that reason that these services need to be 
protected from major political upheavals. The formula that has 
been offered will create a situation in which changes in the 
leaderships of these services will be feasible only in 
conditions of relative political stability. 
  Admittedly, certain shortcomings of these solutions can also 
be noted. In the first place, it can easily be assumed that 
formal jurisdiction over the intelligence service will probably 
be ceded by the head of state to one of his special advisers for 
security issues. That is customary in presidential regimes. With 
the increase in the head of state's real power, the power of his 
adviser (or team of advisers) will also be increased, something 
that is not exactly in the spirit of the regime, which, however, 
is basically a parliamentary one. In the second place, in a 
situation of assumed chronic political instability in the state 
leadership, there is a risk that the heads of these services may 
become detached from real control by the government and the 
republic president, and that new centers of political power may 
thus be promoted. There are no ideal solutions, however, and one 
must also rely on the corrective factor of parliamentary and 
also public oversight. 
  It remains to be seen how, after the anticipated adoption of 
the laws, this part of the Interior Ministry's transformation 
will be carried out in practice. The experiences to date from 
the division of leading positions in state institutions among 
the coalition partners suggest the assumption that things will 
not go smoothly this time either. Whatever happens, that is also 
part of the entertainment called politics.

<F P=106> [Article by G.B.: "Strangling Greek Embargo"] </F>
  [Text] The spring cucumbers and tomatoes that farmers from 
the southern Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] village of Bogdanci will gather and bring to 
market in just a few days will be terribly expensive this year, 
because of the Greek economic blockade of Macedonia that has 
already lasted for two months. According to Gjorgi Icev, 
financial director of the enterprise Izvorski, which with 24 
hectares covered with plants is the biggest agricultural 
exporter in the region, their business is in a tragicomic 
situation: "We used to obtain the fuel for heating the plants 
and all the pesticides through Greece, but now it all has to 
travel here through Bulgaria as well." 
  The embargo that Greece decided on for extremely 
questionable 
political reasons is having destructive consequences for the 
Macedonian economy. The country was already seriously weakened 
because of the sanctions against Serbia, which at one time was 
its most important trading partner, and also because of the 
harsh requirements of a stabilization program under the 
supervision of the IMF; now everything is even more difficult. 
The Macedonians estimate that every month the blockade is 
costing them approximately $80 million, which includes both lost 
exports and the higher transportation costs for shipping goods 
through the Black Sea entrance to Bulgarian Burgas and Albanian 
Durres. 
  Only a few Macedonian exporters were as far-sighted as 
Izvorski, which compensated for the lost "Greek route" in time 
through a joint company with a certain Austrian commercial 
enterprises, which will take this year's early vegetables, worth 
10 million German marks [DM] to the markets of Eastern and 
Central Europe by air. On the other hand, heavy industry is 
literally collapsing; a few days ago the Skopje state steelworks 
finally closed its doors and dismissed 8,000 workers; something 
similar is in the outlook quite soon for the other state 
enterprises, which were dependent upon the railroad link with 
the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki. 
  After Macedonia's GNP declined by 15 percent in 1993, it is 
expected to drop another 8 percent this year. Last year the 
annual income per capita was $700, and inflation is ranging 
around 70 percent. In spite of everything, the Skopje government 
does not intend to give in, since it does not have any guarantee 
that Greece will not resume the blockade again even after its 
demands are met. According to some estimates, Macedonia only has 
oil reserves in its warehouses for another two months, and 
during that period it will attempt somehow to acquire the 
necessary funds ($120 million) to build a 65-kilometer-long 
railroad link with Bulgaria, from which it would obtain crude 
oil for the Skopje refinery. According to the latest news, oil 
is already coming into the country by road from Albania, and 
Macedonia thinks that it could bring 7,500 metric tons of black 
gold a day from Durres.

<F P=106> [Article by Sonja Kiridzievska: "The Grey Economy Is </F>
Destroying Textile Workers"] 
  [Text] The mass smuggling of textile products for 
which turnover taxes are not paid is putting textiles in a 
regular shop only for display, while they are sold on the 
streets and sidewalks; 130 enterprises with 47,000 employees are 
working in the textile industry. 
  The textile industry is sewing for "small change." In spite 
of all the efforts of this labor-intensive economic sector, most 
of which is export-oriented, to create the conditions for bigger 
deals, it still remains at the level of working under the Lon 
system [arrangement in which foreign company supplies materials 
and possibly equipment and receives part or all of goods 
produced by local labor], which is promoted by cheap labor. Last 
year this industry, in which 130 enterprises with 47,000 
employees work, had its volume of physical production reduced by 
1.33 percent in its base part, and had a 0.6 percent larger 
decline than Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] industry. Production capacities, up to 30 
percent of which were used by spinners, 40 percent by weavers, 
60 percent by the knitting industry, and 80 percent by the 
clothing industry, were not an obstacle to textile workers' 
achieving exports worth $122 million last year and accounting 
for 14 percent of the country's total exports. 
<H5>  Loss of the Market </H5>
  Under the conditions of the application of UN sanctions 
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], commercial and 
transportation blockades, the growth of costs and high 
competition from East European countries, exports can hardly be 
achieved unless other incentive measures are introduced in 
addition to the realistic exchange rate. The textile industry is 
operating with obsolete equipment, whose extent of depreciation 
in the base sector ranges above 80 percent, and above 60 percent 
in the finished product industry. Because of unresolved 
ownership relations in the last three years, there have been 
almost no investments, and thus, if this lag continues, the 
sector will soon also lose its main market abroad, especially in 
the European Union [EU]. The blackmail tactics of foreign 
partners which, knowing about our situation, are offering 
humiliating prices for Lon-system cooperation, are contributing 
to this. It is thus happening that Macedonian garment makers are 
agreeing to sew certain pieces of clothing for only one mark, 
even though they know that they are being sold for 50 times as 
much in the market. With the implementation of the Stabilization 
Program, it can be seen that the textile workers will not be 
prospering this year. As several directors in this branch of the 
economy have noted, it is illogical for a country to borrow 
foreign exchange and repay it with denars. Likewise, they wonder 
about the logic by which interest rates continue to grow under 
the conditions of a realistic exchange rate for the German mark 
[DM]. That is confirmed by the fact that in January the DM rose 
by only 2.9 percent, but interest rates were between 15 and 16 
percent. 
  After all of this it appears that those faring best in all 
of 
the textile industry are garment makers, which is also confirmed 
by what was exhibited at the Modest 94 fair. The spinners are in 
the same branch, but there 75 percent of the capacity is 
standing idle. The reason for this lies in the fact that the 
Macedonian processors of cotton and wool do not have enough 
funds to provide themselves with raw materials for a longer 
period. The foreign suppliers are offering Macedonian spinners 
cotton at prices up to 30 percent higher than the regular ones. 
This problem can be solved if the Directorate of Commodity 
Reserves purchases a larger amount of semifinished products and 
provides the spinners with a longer period of peace. In view of 
the constant illiquidity of the spinners, the illiquid 
enterprises are dragging along with them those that are in a 
somewhat better condition, since they cannot pay their debts to 
them. And since we are already talking about unpaid bills, the 
Macedonian textile workers, just like the construction workers, 
cannot get their money from Iraq. With the passage of time, that 
amount has reached the figure of $19 million, and the state, in 
spite of all its promises, has not yet collected it. 
<H5>  Textiles on the Streets </H5>
  Struggling with overemployment, which is estimated to amount 
to 20 percent of the total number of employees, low wages far 
behind the average for the economy, by as much as 36 percent, as 
well as additional withholdings from wages, so that for a net 
wage of 100 denars the same amount is given in taxes, the 
textile workers also have to struggle with the gray economy. 
Mass smuggling of textile products, for which the 25 percent 
turnover tax is not paid, is the only reason why textiles are 
displayed in regular shops, but sold on streets and sidewalks. 
It is not clear to textile workers how textiles could have been 
left out of the ban on the sale of goods in marketplaces. 
  In the sea of problems afflicting this sector, one of the 
urgent ones is technological obsolescence and the high degree of 
the amortization of equipment, almost 80 percent of which is 
ready to be written off. Likewise, it is absurd that machines 
which are not produced here should be exempt from customs 
duties, while spare parts for the old machines, which are 
likewise procured through imports, are still subject to customs 
duties. It is precisely for that reason that textile workers are 
demanding that they be exempted from these duties, regardless of 
the cheaper value of the parts, under $1,000. At the same time, 
it is necessary to reexamine the present mechanisms for 
incentives for exports, which, in their current versions, are 
insufficiently stimulating exports in this sphere. Also 
essential is financial assistance for financing the preparation 
of production for export and the reexemption of profits achieved 
through exports. In a situation in which textile workers even 
have the profits from exports taxed, why should they have any 
interest in continuing to export? Accordingly, the new 
institutional measures are assessed by textile workers as solely 
aimed at ensuring a more comfortable life for the state, without 
providing a single denar more for incentives for those who are 
doing a good job. With the curtailment of all privileges for 
those who are export-oriented, the textile workers think that 
the branch that they are sitting on is being cut from under 
them, and also add that the new fiscal policy lacks not only a 
developmental function but also a social welfare function. The 
textile workers are demanding compensatory solutions, and also 
that other permits for imports and exports be valid for one 
year, and not partial and for shorter periods of time, and that 
they be issued within the framework of the Chamber [of Commerce] 
institution. In the area of wages, all the enterprises that have 
an average wage below than the average for the economy should be 
allowed to increase them up to that average, while the process 
of transformation should be accelerated, giving workers an 
opportunity to participate for free in purchasing some of the 
enterprise shares.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Dimitar Buzlevski, chief of the </F>
Customs Administration; place and date not given: "Porous 
Borders"] 
  [Text] The head of Macedonia's [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Customs Administration, Dimitar 
Buzlevski, talks about the new method of collecting duties, the 
service's lack of equipment, corruption.... 
  [PULS] How much money was planned to be supplied for the 
budget last year on the basis of customs duties, and to what 
percentage were the projections fulfilled? 
  [Buzlevski] There were 2.5 billion denars planned, but 90.9 
percent of the projections were fulfilled. It is interesting 
that the percentage achieved was not achieved continuously 
throughout those months, since during the first six months only 
22.2 percent of the planned customs funds were supplied to the 
budget, which indicated a very low level of the collection of 
customs duties. That was associated with many problems in 
customs procedures which directly led to that low percentage 
collected. As a result of certain measures that we subsequently 
implemented, for the period ending in December customs duties 
constitute the highest percentage in fulfillment of the planned 
budget funds. 
  One of the measures that we undertook is to prevent 
manipulations with respect to imports of consumer goods. 
Importers exercised the right of customs supervision of those 
goods, as well as the right to customs storage within their 
business premises, and those goods were very frequently lost and 
put on sale; the state thus, in a way, provided the enterprises 
with advance financing of part of their unpaid customs duties, 
and according to some information, the unpaid sales tax as well. 
It is precisely for that reason that through a decree sometime 
in May 1993 we prohibited putting consumer goods under 
supervision. We thereby achieved two results: preventing the 
uncontrolled placement of those goods in the markets, and at the 
same time gaining the opportunity to collect customs duties on 
time. Likewise, an important element in improving the collection 
of customs duties is placing the collection immediately in the 
customs line, by requesting through the appropriate shipping 
office an instrument for ensuring collection, either acceptance 
or certified checks. 
  There is also one other element that we analyzed in detail 
for improving the collection of customs duties: determining the 
true value of imported goods. The fact is that the importers 
used two types of invoices: an invoice that they received from 
the foreign partner and that cited the real price that they 
paid, and another invoice with a reduced value, i.e., with a 
reduced base for the payment of customs duties. The Customs 
Administration adopted a decision that wherever there are 
suspicions about the validity of the value given in the invoice, 
it is to be verified. 
  [PULS] How many consumer goods were imported last year 
without paying customs duties? 
  [Buzlevski] Somewhere around $600 million. 
  [PULS] With all the exemptions from paying customs duties, 
what level is the general rate? 
  [Buzlevski] The average duty on imports in 1993 was 6 
percent. With this percentage, we are the most liberal country 
in Europe. 
  [PULS] How consistent is our tariff liberalization with 
tariff trends in the world? The GATT negotiations, for example? 
  [Buzlevski] In general, the tariff duty in the United States 
and in the developed West European countries is not much over 
the percentage that was noted here last year. Nevertheless, the 
imported goods subsequently fall under the regime of tax policy. 
In this case there has to be mutual coordination. Let us take 
cigarette smuggling as an example. Our analysis shows that the 
prices of cigarettes in the duty-free shops are more or less 
identical with black market prices. This alone suggests that a 
large part of those cigarettes come from the duty-free shops. 
That is why we are currently preparing a decision on the regime 
for the sale and importation of cigarettes, whiskey, and other 
sought-after products from the duty-free shops. Not to prejudice 
matters, I would also like to state just that the purchase of 
one carton of cigarettes and one bottle of whiskey will be 
permitted, and then only for someone who is leaving Macedonia. 
  [PULS] All of these deviant phenomena and smuggling 
activities suggest the question of whether the Customs 
Administration is equipped to counter those phenomena. 
  [Buzlevski] We are not equipped as a service. We have a 
model 
for development of the Customs Administration that was verified 
by top customs experts in the United States and Canada, but we 
will only be able to speak of successful customs when we have 
started to implement that model. So many things are happening to 
us because we are not equipped to discover them. For example, 
our law allows the tariff payer himself to decide which customs 
branch office the duties will be levied at. The data indicate 
that the Skopje customs house accounts for about 62 percent--a 
figure which itself is very large, and represents a difficulty 
in conducting a detailed inspection of every truck that has 
entered. Otherwise, all the trucks should be inspected in detail 
and the contents of the goods should be verified. In developed 
customs administrations that is simply done with the most modern 
devices: for measuring the density of the freight contents, for 
measuring the length of a vehicle... Likewise, we should equip 
customs in regard to automated data processing. During the 
course of this year we expect to develop that computer network 
and we are on the way to obtaining a finished program. 
  [PULS] After the collapse in transportation that occurred 
with the blockade of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], 
Europe announced a much more liberal procedure for avoiding 
customs jams. How much does that increase the danger of all 
sorts of smuggling--of weapons, for instance? 
  [Buzlevski] We are participating actively in that program, 
which was conceived at the European Union [EU] level. The idea 
of that project is a customs corridor that would make it 
possible for the customs procedure to take place rapidly. In 
certain cases, perhaps, it would become possible for goods to be 
transported to their destinations where they are sent by convoy. 
In mid-March, top experts from the European Customs Union will 
visit Macedonia to implement the project. I can say that the 
European Customs Union's analyses for approving financial 
assistance for modernizing two border crossings are in the final 
phase. These are the Cafasan and Deve Bair border crossings, a 
corridor planned for communications with Europe. North 
Rhine-Westphalia will provide about 1.1 million German marks 
[DM] and the United States will provide $1.1 million to equip 
the Deve Bair border crossing, while they will likewise provide 
$1.1 million for Cafasan. 
  [PULS] A lot is said about the corruption of the customs 
service. 
  [Buzlevski] So far the Service has fired 15 individuals for 
whom there was substantiated proof that they had committed 
serious customs violations. It is a well-known problem with oil 
in Gevgelija and the channel going to Tetovo and Kumanovo, and a 
well-known problem with imports of silk from Turkey and China. 
The blunder of the customs officers was that they participated 
in ensuring the legality of transactions by which the entry of 
the goods was recorded by one customs branch office, but the 
importer, dissatisfied with the established tariff base, 
announced that he would return the goods to the original 
destination, and the customs employee attached a seal to the 
form that the goods had left Macedonia, while they remained here 
de facto. We had the latest case at the Skopje airport a few 
days ago, with imported satellite antennas. 
  [PULS] It has been heard at the Customs Administration that 
a 
list has been prepared of officials who have opened shipping 
offices either in their own names or in the names of close 
relatives. What about them? 
  [Buzlevski] It is a very unfavorable element that a certain 
number of customs officials, even though those individuals are 
in higher-level positions in the customs hierarchy, have 
commercial firms, especially in the area of shipping, which are 
registered in the names of members of their close family. We 
have prepared the list, and the legal procedure for resolving 
this problem is being analyzed now. Two solutions are possible: 
either closing the shipping offices or leaving the job. 
  [PULS] How true is it that last year the Ministry of 
Internal 
Affairs bought automobiles from one of our distributors--we will 
not mention his name and give him an advertisement--in the value 
of DM 1.2 million. We are asking you the question, since such 
activity cannot take place without being observed by the customs 
authorities. 
  [Buzlevski] The Ministry of Internal Affairs is a body that 
has to be well-equipped, and we should not view that negatively. 
The fleet that it has purchased is intended for performance of 
its established duties. 
  [PULS] The fleet can also be equipped with confiscated 
vehicles. How many vehicles were confiscated last year, and how 
many were released for auction through AMSM [Automobile and 
Motorcycle Federation of Macedonia]? 
  [Buzlevski] Approximately 250-300 vehicles are confiscated 
each year. Last year there was only one auction, in Bitola, and 
about 15-20 vehicles were auctioned off. This year, however, 
with the resolution of the dispute over where the second-level 
procedure will take place (it has been determined that it will 
be at the Customs Administration), things will take place more 
quickly. 
  [PULS] Did the number of vehicles confiscated increase last 
year? 
  [Buzlevski] It increased considerably, since a large number 
of individuals sought to take advantage of various benefits, 
especially for imports from Albania. The vehicles were 
registered in the names of firms there, but were driven by 
citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, and that is a customs 
violation. 
  [PULS] Since as a state and a people we are inclined toward 
actions that skirt the edge of the law, we would like to ask you 
whether there have been any pressures on you at all from 
powerful commercial firms or from individuals of high political 
rank to look aside in specific cases. 
  [Buzlevski] I have been at the Customs Administration for 
nine months, and I can freely state that the service, and I 
personally, have been released from all forms of political 
pressures. In practice, it is impossible for such pressures to 
be applied in the Customs Administration. We have established 
such a working regime in customs procedures that the customs 
employee's autonomy is guaranteed, although a commission may 
feel that his work is over. 
  [PULS] Nevertheless, the general belief is that in any 
businessman's contact with certain individuals in your 
hierarchy, things can be made easier with a fat bribe. Is that 
possible? 
  [Buzlevski] It is most likely possible. Nevertheless, in the 
event that it were discovered it would be punished, starting 
with me and including the last employee in the Customs Service.

  [Text] [Announcer] British Secretary of State [title as 
heard] Douglas Hogg has met with the president of the republic 
of Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, in Prishtina. We remind you that 
Mr. Hogg is visiting Kosova as part of his tour to several areas 
of former Yugoslavia. We go over to Skender Durmishi's report 
from Prishtina: 
  [Durmishi] The start of a dialogue on Kosova is necessary 
and the first step to precede all measures and other actions 
toward solving the Kosova question, as one of the most important 
points of the crisis in the former Yugoslav area. We should 
keep looking for concrete forms and solutions -- this was the 
main message with which British Secretary of State Douglas Hogg 
arrived in Prishtina today. At today's talks, Hogg put forward 
this message to both sides. 
  During the meeting with Kosova's president Rugova, the 
high-ranking British guest considered the visit as a gesture of 
good will and expressed his views on possible solutions to the 
Kosova problem. 
  On this occasion, Rugova pointed out that the commitment of 
Kosova Albanians to a peaceful solution is a clear testimony of 
our readiness for dialogue through the mediation of a third 
party. Mr. Rugova said that on the basis of referendum results, 
we have our option for an independent and neutral Kosova, with 
which we can enter the process of dialogue with no prejudice. 
  Considering today's meeting to be very important and after 
briefing the high-ranking guest about the grave situation in 
Kosova, president Rugova demanded more active commitment from 
the international community to a fair solution of Kosova's 
problems. In this respect, we hope that Great Britain, as an 
expert on the problems of Kosova and Albanians, will grant fresh 
assistance, Mr. Rugova said. 
  As part of his visit to Kosova, Foreign Office Minister 
Douglas Hogg met today with representatives of the Serbian side, 
a meeting that was held behind closed doors. 
  In two brief news conferences held after these meetings, 
recalling that he has not brought along any definitive project 
but is expressing his own opinions on possible solutions, Mr. 
Hogg told reporters that the Kosovar problem should be solved 
within the framework of Yugoslavia, because there can be no 
changes to borders. The fact that 90 percent of the Kosovar 
population are Albanians cannot be ignored and this requires 
that economic, political, and the maximal cultural autonomy be 
granted to the Albanians of Kosova. 
  Conditions should be created for the Albanians to exert full 
control over topics of interest, such as the economy, education, 
communications, and their security, as well as having complete 
political and social freedoms. Mr. Hogg also pointed out the 
high level of disagreements and options between the Albanian and 
Serbian sides, which, he said, with the mediation of the 
international community, could be brought closer by means of an 
equal dialogue, because if both sides are not equal, this cannot 
be called a dialogue. 
  Hogg stressed that the pressure on Serbia for the immediate 
return of the CSCE monitors to Kosova is another step for the 
international community, and should follow immediately. 
  In the evening, Hogg held talks with several leaders of 
political parties and intellectuals in Kosova.

  [Excerpt] The State Chamber today finally begun discussing 
the budget documents for this year. As is known, the state 
treasury involves 406 billion tolars, and the budget deficit may 
reach somewhat less than 12 billion tolars. Before the deputies 
commenced the debate on the proposed amendments to the Law on 
Implementing the Budget and to the numerous individual items of 
the budget -- there are more than 170 of those -- deputies heard 
introductory speeches by Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, Finance 
Minister Mitja Gaspari, Dr. France Arhar, governor of the Bank 
of Slovenia, and representatives of the Pension Institute and 
Health Institute. Here is a report by Suzana Kos: 
  [Begin recording] [Kos] After six years of recession, last 
year our state embarked upon economic growth for the first time. 
In the first quarter, industrial production was as much as 3.4 
percent higher than in the same period last year. This is what 
Prime Minister Drnovsek pointed out in his introductory speech. 
Improvement is seen in building, traffic, tourism, and 
agriculture. The number of unemployed reduced by more than 6 
percent until March, while the number of employed has increased. 
Last year's inflation was the lowest since 1979 and, according 
to Dr. Drnovsek, it is not going to increase in the future 
either. After lengthy negotiations, the agreement on the policy 
of wages in this year and the section on wages of the collective 
agreements were signed last year, and all partners have agreed 
to a fixed increase of nominal wages below the rate of 
inflation. Prime Minister Drnovsek spoke about the outcome of 
the negotiations, the signed document, and for the first time 
announced the corresponding legal document. 
  [Drnovsek] With this agreement, the government also received 
the approval of other negotiating partners, the trade unions, 
and representatives of employers to establish by law the 
realization of such an agreement keeping in mind the poor 
experience with realizing collective agreements last year. In 
our opinion, a significant (?breakthrough) will be reached in 
managing this perhaps most necessary sphere of macroeconomic 
policy. Realistic possibilities have been established for [word 
indistinct] most unfavorable currents by the end of 1994 and for 
the establishment of such macroeconomic conditions that would 
enable further production growth and reduction of unemployment. 
  [Kos] Both the prime minister and Finance Minister Mitja 
Gaspari pointed out that the budget deficit must not exceed 1 
percent of gross domestic product and that the government would 
insist on that. Gaspari devoted his speech above all to 
presenting basic aims and important points in the budget 
documents for this year which will be discussed by the State 
Council now. 
  [Gaspari] The estimate of the sources of revenue is 
established on the basis of the current prices, provided the 
planned price increase that I mentioned regarding the previous 
(?implementation) is respected, so it is necessary to rearrange 
the existing funds and not revenue from taxation in the possible 
budget adjustments, unless the parliament decides for an 
increase of budget deficit. I hope that it will not endorse 
such a decision or proposal. 
  [Kos] Dr. France Arhar, governor of the Bank of Slovenia, 
pointed out that the policy and aims that the central bank will 
try to reach to a great extent depend on the decisions the 
deputies will make when deciding about the budget and on the 
level of the deficit they will endorse. The governor also said 
that as we have gotten rid of hyperinflation, we shall now work 
on abolishing the big state treasury [as heard]. 
  [Arhar] And already this month, it plans to appear on the 
market without this well-known iron formula, but with a new 
instrument, a new monetary instrument and with a view to 
starting a new practice and a new philosophy in this sphere. 
Therefore, it will come up with a cost of money and creating 
this cost, and with such parameters that are realistically 
suitable to our competitors, the states with which Slovenia has 
the highest trade. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik "prepared by" </F>
Julius Gembicky in Bratislava; date of interview not given: "A 
Prime Minister for the Short or Long Term?"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Following last year's visit by former 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, the NARODNA OBRODA editorial 
office welcomed Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik 43 days 
after he formed his Cabinet. They are both from central 
Slovakia. However, each is made of different stuff--different 
vocabulary, drive, and temperament. To be honest, the diplomatic 
polish of the latter prime minister is not, on the outside, in 
any way reminiscent of the Polana temperament. It is perhaps 
only revealed by the quiet determination with which he worked 
his way to the top rung of the Slovak political ladder. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Mr. Prime Minister, you traveled along part 
of the same political path as Vladimir Meciar. When did you 
begin to part ways, and what was the moment of truth in your 
mutual relations? 
  [Moravcik] The break did not occur in our personal relations 
but involved a mutual political parting of ways. There is a 
tendency to personalize political disputes in our country. For 
example, I have always had different views from Jan Carnogursky, 
but we have always remained friends. The rift in relations with 
Meciar began last year after I was appointed foreign minister 
and became an open rift in May or June. It consisted of a 
different point of view on looking after Slovakia's interests. 
  We each had a different feeling about how this should be 
done. In my opinion, the methods and style of Meciar's 
government did not do our interests any service. My--almost 
singular--opinion did not at that time represent within the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] an alternative to this 
style of government. It came about with great difficulty and 
under dramatic circumstances. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] In the most recent public opinion poll, 
however, almost 45 percent of respondents are of the opinion 
that the HZDS will again emerge victorious from the early 
elections.... 
  [Moravcik] I am also convinced that the HZDS will obtain the 
highest number of votes in the elections. Obviously, the 
majority of you feel the same. This is very likely, and it 
probably cannot be changed. Of course, this does not mean that I 
support the HZDS. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] What, then, are you doing specifically to 
alter this situation? What kind of chairman are you if you do 
not venture to win the elections? 
  [Moravcik] No, we cannot cope with this responsibility. We 
will not win the elections ourselves. Nevertheless, I am 
convinced that this governing grouping will be successful if it 
combines its efforts. I am willing to work hard for this. I am 
even willing to work on my image. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Some coalition radicals are criticizing you 
and are claiming that the necessary drive alone will not suffice 
for a more effective preelection campaign against the 
opposition. They say that you will not win over the politically 
undecided and irresolute with nonconfrontational decency. Why 
have you adopted defensive tactics? 
  [Moravcik] Because carrying on along confrontational lines, 
which I indicated in my speech when I introduced the 
government's policy statement, would not bring us what we are 
striving for--a calm atmosphere among the population. If we do 
not maintain this, we will not manage to achieve what we have 
set out to achieve. Calm also represents an economic value that 
can be expressed numerically. Therefore, we have no reason to 
change what we started with. I believe that a cooperative style 
of politics will also be asserted after the elections. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] However, it was possible to discern a 
certain tension within the broad coalition government after your 
election as Democratic Union of Slovakia chairman. This also 
took some of your coalition partners by surprise.... 
  [Moravcik] We consulted all of our partners on this 
eventuality. However, as far as the consultations with Party of 
the Democratic Left [SDL] representatives are concerned, I admit 
frankly that, during them, we confused informal talks with 
formal ones. We apologized earnestly to Peter Weiss for this 
mistake and added that it should not affect our relations. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] However, it is still fresh in the people's 
minds that it was your Alternative that did not want the 
political elite to become involved in executive power.... 
  [Moravcik] Even I do not like this solution much. I know 
that 
we have lost some points over this. However, it was a necessary 
compromise that enabled us to implement a plan of cooperation 
among those political entities that have a compatible or close 
orientation. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Could this issue not have been resolved, 
for 
instance, by using the method applied in Great Britain? There 
they differentiate between the party chairman and leader.... 
  [Moravcik] Such a solution was on offer. Only it is unknown 
in our political environment. Our solution corresponds to it. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Other factors, however, may have a much 
more 
significant influence on the outcome of the elections--how much 
money will be left for the social sphere, what kind of price 
hikes there will be, while the increased value-added tax on 
foodstuffs in particular is a major bugbear. 
  [Moravcik] Health care and education are on the verge of 
collapse. To be able to at least maintain education at the most 
essential level and provide health-care services and medicines, 
we simply have to have additional resources. We can acquire 
these by raising taxes. To reduce expenditures and bring in 
resources, we are preparing an option whereby value-added tax 
will be set at the single rate of 25 percent--for luxury 
foodstuffs and services. We want to raise consumer tax on 
cigarettes and alcohol. We are still considering beer. However, 
we do not want to live to the detriment of the future. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] It is said that a government that 
increases the price of beer will fall. 
  [Moravcik] Therefore, we are merely considering it. First 
and 
foremost, however, we would like to bring more resources into 
the budget by means of greater financial discipline, even by 
increasing the fines for misdemeanors. Although not very much is 
obtained from this, the penalty for them is low, and so we can 
allow ourselves to be more strict. We would like to save 
something in expenditure on the Army. It is a problem, but we 
are also thinking about reducing the subsidies for agriculture. 
This will be even more complicated. We want to partially reduce 
the subsidies for energy, but, so far, these measures are merely 
being taken into consideration. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Although we are at the end of April, the 
greatest change is expected in the budget. Was it perhaps 
formulated too optimistically, not only with regard to the 
sources of revenue but also with regard to expenditure? 
  [Moravcik] The sources were overestimated and the 
expenditure 
was underestimated. This causes hidden tension in the budget. We 
will have to take active steps to ensure that health care and 
education do not collapse. If we were to choose the path of 
lesser resistance and permitted a deficit at the level of last 
year's, the state's overall indebtedness would again increase 
and we would nudge the solution to our current problems into the 
future. This would be at variance with what we have undertaken 
to do in the government's policy statement. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Your Cabinet is making the maximum possible 
effort to reach an agreement with the IMF that would create a 
favorable climate for the Slovak Republic's cooperation with the 
financial world. Is this not merely patching up the budget with 
the aim of maintaining the koruna's internal convertibility? 
  [Moravcik] The standby loan and the most advantageous terms 
for its repayment will create an important background, 
especially for the entry of foreign investors. The issue does 
not so much involve the $140 million as the possibility of 
earning some money. Investment injections from outside improve 
our credibility and thus the reliability of our economic and 
trade relations. We could also get loans under more 
disadvantageous conditions, but we value this effect. That is, 
we will enter into this even with the knowledge that some of our 
measures will be unpopular and will affect the pockets of every 
citizen. Therefore, we have to create a form of compensation for 
the socially weakest sectors. We are specifying what kind. 
However, we will decide when all the negotiations are concluded. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Did Deputy Prime Minister Schmognerova and 
Finance Minister Filkus get on well at their talks in Washington 
with representatives from the IMF and the World Bank? 
  [Moravcik] As far as I know, yes. The talks took place in a 
pleasant atmosphere and confirmed the interest from abroad in 
helping Slovakia. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] With your permission, Mr. Prime Minister, a 
heretical question. It seems to us that foreign investors are 
still waiting in front of the gates, at least until the 
elections, because they consider your Cabinet to be a 
provisional one. 
  [Moravcik] Despite this skepticism and the short time we 
have 
at our disposal, I am an optimist. I believe that we will manage 
to convince both potential investors and our citizens before the 
elections. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Every government has made promises of its 
willingness to help businessmen. This is as far as most of them 
got. Moreover, you have little time.... 
  [Moravcik] Therefore, the most important task will be to 
guarantee sufficient sources of credit. The National Bank of 
Slovakia may also increase its credit margin. But this will not 
be enough. We see additional sources in activating the National 
Property Fund, in the Guarantee Bank, and, apart from this, we 
will seek foreign assistance--all during this short period. We 
are thinking about reducing the tax burden on businessmen, which 
is on the verge of tolerability, in the future. It does not 
motivate anyone, but it does lead to tax evasion. Therefore, we 
intend to accede to tax liberalization, which, in essence, has a 
motivating effect and, in the final analysis, increases budget 
revenue. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Some foreign sources have said that, even 
under the former government, the economic decline was halted and 
that we have already pushed off from the bottom.... 
  [Moravcik] We would not assess the state of our economy so 
optimistically. Although there have been some positive trends, 
we have not managed to turn the export-import ratio in the 
desired direction. However, this is also due to the fact that 
exports are usually lower in the first few months of the year; 
they culminate sometime in November. Nevertheless, it is 
possible to expect what we so carefully formulated in the policy 
statement, that the trend toward zero growth is a partial reason 
for optimism. Moreover, the foreign currency operations have 
also shown some signs of life. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] In your opinion, will the negative 
reaction from the Czech side to the mutual assignment of 
certificates for imported foodstuffs and products also be 
projected into the higher prices for agricultural products in 
Slovakia? 
  [Moravcik] When we assumed executive power, the 
implementation of the legal stipulation on their mandatory 
assignment, approved by the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic, had still not been adequately prepared from a 
technical point of view. Therefore, we agreed to a postponement 
of one month. It could not be resolved hitherto because of the 
different interests of the Slovak and Czech sides. However, I do 
not think it is exactly helpful if, a week before the deadline 
expires, the whole issue is transferred from the specialist to 
the political level, even though there was no time to resolve 
the contentious points before 1 May. However, this does not 
release us from the mandatory assignment of certificates as laid 
down by the law. I also conveyed this to [Czech Trade and 
Industry] Minister Dlouhy in a telephone conversation when he 
requested a further postponement. However, if problems have 
cropped up on their side, they could have let us know earlier. 
It was already too late for us. And will this matter be 
projected into the increased prices? Issuing certificates does 
not exact especially high financial costs. But it could if it 
stiffly curbs the import of cheaper Czech products. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Mr. Prime Minister, your government is to 
prepare a number of laws for parliament. Will you be able to 
cope with the process of adopting them in view of the fact that 
summer and the recess are approaching? 
  [Moravcik] Yes, if we proceed from the idea of a working 
summer. For us to achieve this, parliament will hold a working 
session at the end of July. We would like to adopt some of the 
norms, while others will be at least legislatively prepared for 
the postelection government. Our ambition is that it is our 
coalition government, although we do not know whether it would 
have the same personnel it has at the moment. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] In your opinion, what will the HZDS 
deputies 
come out with in their proposal to recall Deputy Prime Minister 
Kovac? 
  [Moravcik] I am convinced that the accusation is fabricated. 
I am also convinced that this is merely an attempt to denigrate 
government members. This is a scheme according to which, if they 
do not prove anything, they will at least sow seeds of doubt in 
the people's minds. Such a way of thinking is alien to me. 
Political practices like this merely damage Slovakia. I do not 
think it is a decent form of political rivalry. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Is your situation also not complicated, 
Prime Minister, by the rumors that one of your Cabinet team has 
problems with the screening law? 
  [Moravcik] As it is made clear in the screening law, I asked 
for all government members to be screened to find out if they 
comply with the law's conditions. I am waiting for an answer. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Apparently, some coalition partners are 
also 
thinking about changing the election law. The issue involves, in 
particular, increasing the number of electoral districts from 
four to seven. Moreover, the SDL is proposing that the election 
campaign be shortened to two weeks and that the number of 
broadcasts on radio and television be cut.... 
  [Moravcik] At the moment, opinions are not unanimous in 
everything. However, we have agreed that we will adhere to the 
hitherto valid rules of the game--that is, four electoral 
districts and a month-long election campaign. Nonetheless, we 
have left this issue open. We did not consider it to be a 
fundamental problem. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] In connection with the term of your mandate 
and the unpopularity of some measures, you may find yourself in 
a dilemma over whether to postpone the early elections.... 
  [Moravcik] I admit that this is the case. Six months is too 
little to be able to change more substantially the ratio of 
political forces--that is, the problems of the old parliament 
will, to a certain extent, recur after the elections. I make no 
secret of the fact that, during the talks with our partners, we 
also discussed the idea of postponing the elections until 1995. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Why was the idea not adopted? 
  [Moravcik] Some parties were of the opinion that this would 
not be to their advantage. It seems this was not quite the 
correct conclusion to reach. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Mr. Prime Minister, you are a native of 
Ocova. When did you last sing with Jan Berky-Mrenica? 
  [Moravcik] I have never sung with him. But I like his music 
very much. It is a shame we have not seen each other for a 
couple of years. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] So, what if you were to meet in NARODNA 
OBRODA next time?

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Euke Frank; </F>
place and date not given: "Visions of a Short-Time Prime 
Minister"] 
  [Text] [Frank] Your transition government has no more than 
six months until the next election in the fall. Do you see any 
chances at all to take future-oriented steps in such a short 
period? 
  [Moravcik] Absolutely. We have put together a cabinet of 
experts. Priority will be given to stabilizing the economic 
situation, stimulating exports, and, most important, providing 
social security for the people. 
  [Frank] Is Vladimir Meciar, your former party colleague and 
now political adversary, making life difficult for you because 
he is in the opposition? After all, his political style was not 
always exactly fine. 
  [Moravcik] Quite so. I think that we will not give him any 
chance to make commentaries that are beside the point. He has to 
deal nfow with experts and not with political functionaries. 
  [Frank] If the fall election were to result in a hung 
parliament, would you be ready to enter into a coalition with 
him? 
  [Moravcik] For this he would have to change his political 
style fundamentally. 
  [Frank] By his statements on the Romanies living in 
Slovakia, 
Meciar triggered a storm of indignation in the international 
media. What do you think about this problem? 
  [Moravcik] As so often, Meciar chose the wrong tone and the 
wrong words. On substance, however, I must say that he was 
right. The crime rate among this part of the population is above 
average, and it constitutes a burden for our budget through the 
high children's benefits it claims. 
  [Frank] Are you working on a solution? 
  [Moravcik] Creating employment means more jobs for 
everybody, 
including the Romanies. As far as child benefits are concerned, 
we will have to make cuts, such as freezing the increase in 
child benefits as of the fourth child. 
  [Frank] According to a survey, more than 60 percent regret 
the separation from the Czech Republic.... 
  [Moravcik] In the long term, it was our only chance.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac regards the 
deputies' proposal to express no confidence in himself as a kind 
of lesson. In an interview granted to the TASR news agency, he 
said that he learned from circles close to the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] that proposals similar to this one 
are being prepared to be raised at the next meeting of 
parliament. 
  Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said the debate on no 
confidence in Roman Kovac documented the poverty of the 
political culture of certain sections of deputies and political 
groups. At the same time, he did not rule out that similar 
proposals on no confidence will appear in the future, too. He 
said, however, that he is convinced that these moves do not at 
all affect the stability of the present government.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 30 
April on page 2 carries a 200-word TA SR report on President 
Michal Kovac's visit to Cadca, center of the Kysuce region in 
north Slovakia, on 29 April and the speech he made on the 
occasion. On 3 May, the same newspaper on page 3 carries a 
600-word Viera Urbanova commentary criticizing the "escalating 
attacks" on former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, with special 
emphasis on President Kovac's speech in Cadca. 
  The TA SR report includes the following passage: "President 
Kovac said that he came to the Kysuce region to get to know the 
region's problems on the spot and to gain a better understanding 
of them. He also explained some of the reasons that led to the 
recent change in the Slovak Government. According to his words, 
many of the former government's practices had long signaled a 
discrepancy between its proclamations and actual deeds. The 
prime minister's autocratic method of government, the 
suppression of different views, defamations, not saying the 
whole truth, and the scandalization of people from other 
political entities were the main reason for the government's 
loss of favor and support even among some of its own deputies, 
the president added." 
  The Urbanova commentary is entitled "Meciar Persecution 
Mania--Remedy for Unemployment?" The author observes that the 
new government coalition, "which is pledged to pursuing 
civilized policies without confrontational tones," is doing the 
exact opposite, and its "attacks" on the former prime minister 
"are even escalating." In this context, she says: "The 
president, who, as head of state, should be, first and foremost, 
a moral authority, should stand above matters, and should apply 
the same yardstick to anyone, has not managed to step over his 
shadow of a provincial politician. During his visit to north 
Slovakia, Michal Kovac defied everything of which he wants (and 
should) be a safeguard: calm and peace, which Slovakia needs the 
most. In Zilina, he spoke about reconciliation, and, in 
neighboring Cadca, he once again fully exposed his Meciar 
persecution mania, which he finds so difficult to conceal. If 
the head of state wants to get to know the problems of a region, 
why does he have to lower himself to calling the chairman of the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia names? It is very doubtful 
whether this attitude of the president will resolve unemployment 
or calm down passions among people. It seems that tolerance, 
statesmanlike wisdom, and foresight still have not made it to 
our latitudes, while the discrepancy between proclamations and 
actual deeds is thriving here."

  [Excerpts] Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan continues 
his three-day working visit to Germany. Following the meeting 
with his counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, yesterday, today he met with 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. He also had talks with Hans 
Ulrich Klose, leader of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany] group in the Bundestag. Eduard Kukan is now on his way 
to Berlin. Shortly before he left, our correspondent Branislav 
Zvara asked him to briefly sum up his talks so far: 
  [Begin recording] [Kukan] After we had talks with Minister 
Kinkel, we were pleased to hear of support for Slovakia's 
efforts aimed at membership of the European Union and NATO, as 
was the case of Portugal, Spain, and other countries. In 
geographic terms, Germany is our closest partner, and Germany 
knows intimately the process of transformation that is under way 
in Slovakia because Germany itself is pursuing a similar process 
in one part of its territory. [passage omitted] 
  [Zvara] Did you discuss the agreement on Slovakia's 
association with the European Union? According to Bundestag 
Chairwoman Mrs. Rita Suessmuth, this agreement should be 
ratified before the summer vacation. 
  [Kukan] We discussed this issue, which Slovakia considers 
very important at this time, because before we submit our 
official membership application, all twelve [European Union 
countries] will have to complete the ratification process. Two 
countries, Denmark and Great Britain, have ratified the 
association agreement so far. Minister Kinkel reassured me that 
he does not envision ratification problems in the Bundestag and 
that it should take place as early as July. 
  [Zvara] Minister, contacts between the Slovak Republic and 
Hungary have recently been very intensive. I would like to know 
whether Mr. Kinkel was briefed about these issues and mainly 
whether he was briefed about tackling some problem areas that 
have played a rather negative role in relations between Hungary 
and Slovakia. 
  [Kukan] Germany is following with great interest the 
development of relations between Slovakia and Hungary. We 
discussed these issues, and the outcome of our discussion was 
that we will facilitate our own rapprochement with Europe if we 
can prove that we are sufficiently politically mature and 
advanced to address these issues on a bilateral basis. 
  I assured the minister that this was precisely the way in 
which Slovakia approached these issues and that the new 
government has succeeded in creating a better and more calm 
atmosphere in relations with Hungary and that this atmosphere 
will, in effect, lead to solving these issues on a step-by-step 
basis, starting with the issues of lesser importance and later 
focussing on the big treaty with Hungary. We are confident that 
the two of us will be able to resolve these issues. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

on Yesterday's Demonstration"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--"This is a needless politicization and 
ideologization of the problem, which cannot have a positive 
influence on bilateral relations between Slovakia and Cuba," 
Juan Sanchez Monroe, charge d'affairs at the Cuban Embassy in 
the Slovak Republic, told a news conference about yesterday's 
demonstration for the release from prison of dissident Joel 
Duenas Martinez, which was organized by the Bratislava branch of 
Amnesty International. Out of respect for the Slovak public and 
following a personal conversation with Marta Simeckova, the 
Bratislava representative of Amnesty International, J.S. Monroe, 
pledged already last year that he would personally plead for the 
revision of the verdict. This happened in March of this year 
and in April Martinez was released from prison. "Cuba did this 
as a friendly gesture toward the Slovak Republic," J.S. Monroe 
said. That is why he considers yesterday's demonstration, as 
well as the previous March demonstration, inappropriate 
interference in the Slovak-Cuban dialogue.

Pittner and Croatian Minister of Internal Affairs Ivan Jarnjak 
signed an agreement between the Governments of the Slovak 
Republic and the Republic of Croatia on the extradition and 
acceptance of their own citizens, as well as a protocol on the 
execution of the agreement, in Bratislava yesterday. [passage

  The agreement will facilitate cooperation between the police 
and the security forces of both countries in uncovering criminal 
activity. [passage omitted] 
  Slovak Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner announced at a 
briefing that some 18,000 foreign nationals are currently 
staying legally in the Slovak Republic, and another 
20,000-30,000 are estimated to be staying here illegally, most 
of whom are citizens of the former USSR. Chechens, in 
particular, are engaged in criminal activity on our territory. 
Certain indications suggest that they play the role of some 
kind of punitive expeditions in connection with international 
crime or the role of drug couriers. Jarnjak said that, although 
the number of foreign tourists doubled in Croatia last year, the 
crime rate declined 18 percent, also thanks to preventive 
operations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "kht": "For Cooperation in the Interest of </F>
Citizens"] 
  [Excerpts] Kosice--The constituent assembly of the Union of 
Slovak Cities [Unie slovenskych miest], which has been initiated 
by the Club of Mayors of Slovakia, was held in Kosice yesterday. 
Its founding members are Nove Mesto nad Vahom, Spisska Nova Ves, 
Nova Dubnica, Kezmarok, Levoca, Kosice, Pezinok, Rajec, Stary 
Smokovec, Trencianske Teplice, and Banska Bystrica. 
Representatives of another nine cities participated in the 
assembly as observers. 
  The reason for the union's founding is [a search for] 
decentralization of state power in Slovakia through the 
strengthening of local self-administration and the creation of 
regional self-administration. The union sets itself as its main 
targets the approval of a law on the territorial and 
administrative division of the Slovak Republic on the basis of 
counties [zupny princip]; cooperation between the city, the 
county, and the state for the citizen's benefit; the enforcement 
of economic and financial independence of self-administrative 
bodies; cooperation with citizens in the development of the 
region; and mutual cooperation among cities in tackling their 
common problems. [passage omitted] The twelve mayors of the 
founding cities of the union and their statutory representatives 
elected Rudolf Bauer, mayor of Kosice, as president of the 
union. Engineer Stanislav Mika and Engineer Milan Hort became 
vice presidents. [passage omitted] 
  [Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 30 April on page 2, under 
the 
headline "They Want Division Into Counties," carries a 200-word 
"rm"-signed report on the above assembly. The report notes that

<F P=106> [Article by "ip": "Social Dimension of Transformation; </F>
Results of Slovak Government and National Bank Mission"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--The IMF has become more flexible, 
Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova said yesterday 
after returning from talks at the IMF's Washington headquarters. 
  According to Schmognerova, the fund's steering bodies are 
beginning to realize that, apart from assisting in the 
macroeconomic stabilization of the transforming economies of 
Central and East Europe, it is also necessary to assist in their 
structural reforms. An important role in this process is to be 
played by the World Bank. Both international financial 
institutions are beginning to realize the social dimension of 
transformation, and it seems that they will take it into 
consideration when making recommendations for economic recovery. 
Our delegation won the support of supreme IMF and World Bank 
representatives, and the acquisition of a standby loan amounting 
to up to 40 percent of our stake in the IMF is realistic as 
early as June. It will be paid out over the rest of 1994 and 
the entire year 1995, which can be understood as an expression 
of trust in the stability of the Slovak economy. The condition 
for loans from the World Bank, which could be approved as early 
as September, is that we specify our national economic 
priorities. Resources from the World Bank are to be used for 
the restructuring of commercial banks, the formation of a 
rational labor market, and the completion of apartments under 
construction. [passage omitted] 
  Slovak National Bank [NBS] Governor Vladimir Masar said that 
it transpired from his talks with IMF representatives that the 
NBS is fulfilling its monetary program and that the IMF accepts 
the instruments being applied in monetary policy. 
  Only questions of budget policy remain open. The NBS 
governor came to an agreement with major investment companies 
and banks on their cooperation in putting our commercial banks 
on a sound footing. Special emphasis was placed on the size of 
financial injections and the method of their use.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Schellander: "Blow to the `Yugomafia'"] </F>
  [Text] Splendid success by the Austrian police; 35 
individuals and the leadership of an organization headquartered 
in Belgrade arrested; further proceedings under way. 
  Vienna--The Austrian police have succeeded in a decisive 
blow 
against part of the organized crime operating from Austrian 
territory. At a news conference, representatives of the Group 
for the Struggle Against Organized Crime [EDOK], a special 
section within the Austrian Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
reported the arrest of 35 individuals and the leadership of an 
organization that was named the "Yugomafia" in official jargon. 
With indictments, the Austrian security authorities have 
initiated proceedings against 150 other individuals. In 
connection with this, Director for Public Security Michael Sika 
revealed that the state authorities had managed to obtain 
concrete evidence of the organized activity of the so-called 
Yugoslav mafia for the first time. 
  Both the head of the international criminal 
network--33-year-old Zajim Sabanagic--and most of the captured 
members are former Yugoslav citizens from Serbia. The goal of 
the well-organized gang was to acquire and cash in on monetary 
funds that were derived primarily from the theft of credit cards 
and bank checks, dealing in drugs, automobiles and weapons, and 
protection rackets. The Yugomafia's network, according to the 
Austrian detective, was professionally organized and 
commercially well-concealed. 
  The theft of credit cards and bank and traveler's checks 
(they found 1,500 checks worth 3.5 million schillings) was 
organized abroad. For that purpose the gang--its cooperation 
with Italian and South American organized crime was very 
close--employed a real army of South American pickpockets. The 
members of the "Serbian syndicate" handled the exchange and sale 
of the stolen means of payment in Austria. A bank robbery in 
Milan is also attributed to the gang. 
  With the aid and cooperation of colleagues abroad, the 
Austrian detectives came across the trail of thefts and diverse 
other criminal activities by the gang throughout Europe. 
International warrants have been issued for two other members of 
the organization's leadership, 36-year-old Ratko Bjelobaba and 
28-year-old Goran Sojic. 
  The monetary funds accumulated by the "Yugomafia" at its 
Vienna headquarters did not improve the lifestyle of its members 
in only nonessential ways. A large part of the criminally 
acquired monetary loot found its way to Belgrade--the funds were 
also intended to finance the war in the Balkans. 
  In connection with this, one circumstance during the 
questioning of the syndicate's head was eloquent: It was only 
when the Austrian police officials threatened, of course as a 
joke, that they would send the confiscated money to Bosnia that 
Sabanagic became "cooperative" and yielded some information. 
  The damage caused by the syndicate's activity is estimated 
at 
100 million schillings. 
  The successful operation by the Austrian security 
authorities 
will probably be included in a collection of exemplary and 
illustrative documentation at European Interpol.

  [Text] The leadership of the Confederation of Independent 
Trade Unions in Bulgaria [KNSB] considers yesterday's national 
warning strike a success. In practice, it achieved all its 
planned aims and created the conditions for the success of the 
upcoming general strike on 17 May. KNSB President Professor 
Krustyu Petkov declared this at a news conference today. 
  A few hours later, the KNSB Executive Committee decided at a 
meeting to instruct the KNSB National Strike Committee to start 
preparing for the general strike tomorrow. The committee also 
decided to support the Union of Democratic Forces' [SDS] 
proposal for updating the national budget. The KNSB Executive 
Committee appeals to the parliamentary groups of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP], Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS], Union 
of Democratic Forces [SDS], and other members of the dynamic 
majority not to cast their votes against the cabinet retaining 
its present membership. 
  The KNSB leadership has unfortunately established that the 
government ignored the strike and encouraged repressive actions 
aimed at threatening the strikers and trade union leaders. 
Following his visit to Dupnitsa today with General Kosta 
Bogatsevski [chief secretary of Interior Ministry], Professor 
Krustyu Petkov stated that the KNSB has no claims in connection 
with the action taken by the local police there, but believes 
that the police were ordered to counteract the strike action 
there and that the order came from people above Interior 
Minister Viktor Mikhaylov. 
  The actions of the KNSB may bring the communists to power, 
Dr. Konstantin Trenchev, president of the Podkrepa Labor 
Confederation, declared at a news conference today. Podkrepa's 
view that the government is procommunist and is promoting active 
recommunization remains unchanged. According to Trenchev, the 
solution is to hold elections. At the moment, Podkrepa is 
waiting to see how the situation develops because no further 
mistakes can be allowed to occur, Dr. Trenchev said. However, 
the confederation's position might change to an aggressive 
stance if the Podkrepa Confederative Council decides so at its 
meeting on 9-10 May in Pazardzhik.

  [Text] Since the situation that would emerge if the 
anticipated cabinet changes are approved actually means a new 
mandate, we must accomplish within 50 days what we could not do 
in 16 months, otherwise we will fail miserably. This position 
was defended at a cabinet meeting today by Finance Minister 
Stoyan Aleksandrov. He later explained his motives at a news 
conference. 
  According to Stoyan Aleksandrov, if the government succumbs 
to trade union and political pressure and adopts a cheap, 
populist policy of compensations, a catastrophe will immediately 
follow. 
  At a meeting with Prime Minister Berov Finance Minister, 
Aleksandrov said it is not normal to divide the functions of the 
Finance Ministry leader's important post. 
  At the cabinet meeting today, the prime minister asked all 
the ministers to present by tomorrow morning at the latest 
written opinions on possible measures in their separate 
ministries by the end of June.

  [Text] We have just received the news that Gyula Horn has 
been involved in an accident. Peter Juhasz reports: 
  [Juhasz] Not long after 2100, Gyula Horn, chairman of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP], who was on his way home after 
his end of campaign mass rally in Miskolc, has been in an 
accident. 
  Details are not known thus far. All I managed to find out a 
few minutes ago was that Gyula Horn's car crashed into a truck 
that did not have its lights on while passing on the No. 3 main 
trunk road between Nyekladhaza and Emoed. Three people were 
injured in the crash, including the party chairman. How and to 
what extent are not yet known. 
  Anyway, preparations have already been made at the trauma 
department of the Miskolc Iron Works Hospital to receive the 
injured.

before midnight about the condition of Gyula Horn, who suffered 
a car accident tonight. According to the report, the HSP 
[Hungarian Socialist Party] chairman has suffered a fracture of 
the cervical vertebra. Luckily the vertebra did not become 
dislodged and no nerves have been damaged. 
  Apart from this, one of his wrists was broken and he has 
facial injuries. 
  Gyula Horn lost consciousness at the moment of the crash but 
he has now come round and is well considering the circumstances.

  [Text] This morning a news briefing was held on Hungarian 
Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn's condition at the 
hospital's casualty ward in Miskolc. Among other things, it was 
said that the politician lost consciousness in the accident last 
night and he does not remember what happened. His cervical 
vertebra and one of his wrists are broken. His mind is clear, 
and neurological changes still cannot be found. Peter Juhasz's 
interview follows. 
  [Begin recording] [Juhasz] Dr. Zoltan Katona, director of 
the 
county hospital. How is Mr. Horn at the moment? 
  [Katona] His condition is satisfactory and reassuring, thank 
you very much. He spent last night peacefully. The broken bones 
were fixed during the night. No complications have occurred. 
According to our expectations, he might get up on Wednesday [11 
May], or so. 
  [Juhasz] It means that he might even leave the hospital, 
does 
not it? 
  [Katona] Yes. However, the question of whether he will 
return straight to his home or, perhaps, to an institute in 
Budapest for a few-day observation, has to be discussed with him 
and doctors who will carry out the check-ups later. 
  [Juhasz] How are his two colleagues? 
  [Katona] His companion had to be operated last night, 
because 
a part of his skull was crushed, therefore some bits of the 
fractured scull had to be removed. The occurance of his 
indisposition accompanied by fainting has become less frequent. 
His condition is satisfactory. 
  The car driver has broken his arm, which is currently being 
operated on. He and Horn's companion can presumably leave the 
hospital by the end of next week. [end recording]

<F P=106> [First of several in a series of unattributed articles: "The </F>
Image of Party Programs, Part I"] 
  [Text] NEPSZABADSAG has conducted an all-round inquiry 
among the political parties that succeeded in presenting a 
national list in order to make it easier for the readers to 
decide on whom to vote for. We wanted to publish the summaries 
according to an alphabetical order, but the answer of the 
Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] arrived yesterday 
after the press deadline, so we will publish their short program 
in our next issue. 
  Questions: 
  1. What are the three major political, economic, social, or 
welfare tasks facing the governing forces in the next four 
years, tasks that your party accepts and will give preference to 
even at the cost of other problems? 
  2. What are the three larger-than-average economic, 
political, social, or moral burdens facing the society or some 
strata of the society in the next four years, burdens connected 
with or independent of the aforementioned tasks that you do not 
accept or accept only partially, and which you force into the 
background compared with other similar problems? 
<H5>  Agrarian Alliance </H5>
  1. Preparing the agricultural sector for the role of 
governing, the agricultural program is the most developed part 
of our party's program, and its title also expresses the essence 
of our conviction: The crisis that emerged in the agricultural 
sector requires the reorganization of agriculture. Our party 
places agriculture in first place among the sectors capable of 
accelerating our national economy. Our main goal is to put an 
immediate end to the crisis and to create legal and income 
security for agricultural producers. For this, we want to raise 
our agricultural concept to the level of a government program 
that enjoys a broad parliamentary support, and thus create 
guarantees for the supply of budget resources necessary for the 
implementation of the national agricultural program. 
  It is clear for the Agrarian Alliance that agriculture 
should 
play a lasting stabilizing role in Hungary in an economic policy 
that asserts this country's interests well, and agriculture 
should have a greater national economic weight in our Gross 
Domestic Product [GDP], exports, and employment, compared with 
the more developed countries. 
  Modernization also contains the requirement that Hungary 
should develop proportionally and the level of development of 
various parts of the country and types of settlements should be 
balanced. 
  If the current trends continues, there will be a danger of 
increased territorial inequality and social division. This will 
appear not only in the confrontation between towns and villages 
and between the capital city and the provinces, but also in the 
increasing differences in the people's life expectations, 
quality of life, and social situation. 
  The universal realization of the fact that the development 
of 
intellectual resources -- education and scientific research -- 
is the most profitable investment must be raised to the level of 
government policy. The level of extent of these resources 
determines today the level of economic development and the 
possibilities of participation in the international integration. 
At the same time, investments aimed at increasing the 
intellectual capital are directly connected with the bourgeois 
transformation of society. 
  2. The situation is obviously sensitive: One has to speak 
of forcing important issues into the background on the eve of 
parliamentary elections. Among the various possible issues, we 
mention first the fact that, no matter how justified it is to 
increase the professional level in the ministries and government 
offices, we would not be able to pay for really good 
professionals in the future either, because, in the state 
administration, we will continue to be unable to compete with 
the income possibilities prevailing in the sphere of enterprises 
and private ventures. The development and modernization of 
Hungary's defense forces is an even bigger issue, and it 
requires considerable resources. At the same time, the budget 
will not enable an adequate increase in defense expenditure in 
the near future. And now an example from the world of culture. 
The construction of the new National Theater is a really 
important national issue that was decided long ago; however, it 
is highly improbable that the necessary budget can be allocated 
for this in the coming four years. 
<H5>  United Smallholders' Party [EKGP] </H5>
  1. The EKGP regards the following as partial measures of the 
three major tasks: 
  -- irrigation development of up to 1 million hectares; 
  -- a maximum interest level of 10 percent; 
  -- industrial export subsidies of 7-8 billion forints 
annually and agricultural export subsidies of 30-35 billion 
forints annually; 
  -- an encouraging tax system; 
  -- an annual export volume of $8 billion and $4 billion 
respectively; 
  -- a maximum annual global consumption quota of $200 
million, 
without private cars; 
  -- a maximum of $100-$150 million agricultural imports 
annually; 
  -- an annual foreign trade surplus of $1.5-$2 billion; 
  -- a maximum annual budget deficit of 100 billion forints; 
  -- a streamlined army personnel, good technology, and state 
administration; 
  -- the use of customs charges [vampotlek] (3-5 billion 
forints annually up to the year 2000); 
  -- acceleration of investments with subsidies of 15 billion 
forints annually (industry-agriculture and price-interest). 
  2. "Burdens" connected to important things cannot be left 
"unsettled!" There can be only slight "burdens" connected to 
the aforementioned "key tasks" (burdens that can only enjoy less 
government interference and smaller financial resources); 
  -- sports; 
  -- film production; 
  -- state finance for other arts; 
  -- social support for inactive strata of the society 
(between 
20 and 55 years of age); 
  -- tax exemptions [adokimeles] for luxury and prestige 
consumption; 
  -- government aid to unsuccessful banking or insurance 
activity. 
<H5>  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] </H5>
  1. According to the Fidesz, the three major tasks of the 
coming four years are the following: the creation of jobs, 
educational reform, and the development of backward areas. 
  The new government will have to face the fact that the using 
up of the future [jovofeleles] carried out by the governments in 
power in the past 10 years can no longer continue; in other 
words, it is impossible to accumulate the foreign and domestic 
debt continuously. If the credits are used to temporarily keep 
the level of social consumption high and not for increasing the 
economic performance, the Fidesz will not accept further 
increases in debts. Using up future resources primarily limits 
the living conditions of the young generation, because they are 
only left with repaying the interest on the debts accumulated by 
their predecessors, while they hardly have any share of the 
temporary higher consumption. 
  Therefore, the most important task is to improve the 
economy's competitiveness, carry out investments aimed at 
creating new jobs, and conduct an economic policy that 
encourages saving. In addition, it is absolutely necessary to 
reform the system of budget redistribution and to come to a 
social consensus. The most important element of the latter is 
an agreement with the trade unions, an agreement that will make 
it possible to reduce inflation by at least 5 percent in one 
year. 
  From the increased economic performance resulting from the 
aforementioned steps, greater resources than hitherto should be 
allocated to prevent the final degradation of backward areas 
particularly affected by the crisis. 
  2. Although almost everyone in Hungary today feels that his 
living standard is lower than the one he deserves, one can 
nevertheless not promise an increase in the level of consumption 
in the short term. We only have a real chance to catch up with 
the developed countries if we first allocate more resources to 
investments that lay the foundations for a competitive 
performance. 
  All this demands that social consumption should not increase 
according to our wishes. This is particularly true in the 
situation in which both our domestic budget balance and our 
international balance of payments show an unparalleled deficit. 
The new government will receive this situation as a starting 
inheritance. 
  Only a few social groups will have the possibility to obtain 
greater resources than permitted by the overall economic 
performance through social redistribution. According to the 
Fidesz program, these are the young people and the young 
unemployed. We would support them with the increased 
development of education and through employment. In addition, 
we will pay particular attention to preserving the value of the 
pensions of people older than 70 and people living below the 
minimal wage level. 
<H5>  Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] </H5>
  1. The illustrious figure of the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF], Mr. Lajos Fur, said the following: "The MDF succeeded in 
halting Hungary's fall. We stopped at the bottom of the pit." 
We can believe Mr. Fur. He should know. One can, at the most, 
argue about how deep this pit is. 
  The above quotation is rather cynical, but essentially we 
must start from a factual conclusion. Our homeland is in mortal 
danger! Only firm, clear, and rapid measures can help. 
Concretely, we should immediately put an end to the squandering 
of this country's property. We must create the bases of a real 
constitutional state. The present government kept legislating 
innumerable laws, laws that often contradict each other and 
leave legal gaps. And their economic and financial consequences 
are not elaborated properly. Patchwork does not lead anywhere! 
When building a house, one should start at the base, not at the 
roof. 
  In other words, we need a new constitution! We must 
determine the basic values of our society! Based on this, we 
must create a really pro-venture legal and economic environment 
that leads to economic progress. We must immediately reduce 
public burdens considerably in order to increase the interest of 
ventures and entrepreneurs. We must see to it that property 
relations are settled in a way acceptable to all. We must 
reexamine the handling of our debts, which has become almost 
unbearable. 
  We must eliminate unemployment. In the previous development 
phase of market economy, as a result of spontaneous 
manipulations partially based on certain interests, unemployment 
was a real economic category. This is something antiquated 
today, and it is unacceptable for us. 
  Young people should receive housing, jobs, opportunities to 
study, and prospects, and elderly citizens should receive an 
honest subsistence. 
  We must carry out these tasks in a rather short time, and 
not 
in the distant and foggy future. The Hungarian people should 
get their confidence back, a confidence that the previous 
governments that openly served the Russian interests and the 
recent post-communist government tried to rob in the past 
decades. We can count in months, or years at the most. The 
people's patience is limited! This country is in mortal danger! 
We must act accordingly. The FKGP has detailed programs based 
on exact evaluations. 
  2. The people were promised democracy! In reality, a 
monolithic power based on a hidden pact policy is increasingly 
emerging with an arrogance exceeding that of the previous 
dictatorship. Hungary's economy, culture, and society are 
deteriorating rapidly. From a consistent evaluation of this 
process, we can draw the conclusion that we are not only talking 
about an unbelievable dilettantism here, but also about a 
deliberate destruction of this country. And all this is taking 
place in a way as if there were democracy here. In other words, 
they try to blame democracy for the infamy carried out against 
the Hungarian people. The FKGP wants to stop the ravages of this 
government. The FKGP accepts the implementation of this task 
and it takes upon itself to return the confidence of this nation. 
  It is obvious that one cannot disregard certain groups of 
social tasks in a society that is at the bottom of the pit. It 
is particularly impossible to disregard the fact that they want 
to break the faith of the Hungarian people in order to make them 
helpless and slaves. 
  Naturally, there can be priorities in economic life. Driving 
sectors are needed, but the basic conditions of development 
should be created in all areas of society. This is the historic 
task of the FKGP today. 
<H5>  Republic Party </H5>
  1-2. The program of the Republic Party outlines three major 
tasks. The consolidation and subsequent stabilization of the 
economy presupposes the reduction of inflation. For the 
economic conditions to improve and become attractive for 
domestic and foreign investors, and for the living conditions 
and quality of life of the population to improve, there is a 
need to develop the infrastructure more rapidly than the average 
development. Along with this, unemployment should be reduced to 
an acceptable level, unemployment that causes one of the biggest 
shocks to Hungarian society. 
  Obviously, this needs a different economic policy based on a 
new type of distribution of the domestic income (one that will 
not increase after the change in the government either). 
Consequently, along with a gradual reorganization of the tax 
system and the reduction of tax burdens, we can no longer delay 
the reform of the large distribution systems, the budget, and 
state management either. 
  However, it is also clear that the implementation of the 
aforementioned major goals and the restoration of our domestic 
and foreign economic balance is a long-term task and requires 
certain deliberate compromises. 
  According to well-founded evaluations, a complete 
elimination 
of unemployment along with a consistent implementation of an 
anti-inflationary policy is not a realistic goal. Therefore, we 
will have to live with an unemployment rate of about 5-5.5 
percent in the coming years. If we tried to force unemployment 
under the aforementioned level, it would become impossible to 
reduce inflation. 
  At the same time, the planned reduction of the unemployment 
rate limits the reduction of inflation. Thus, we can expect a 
lasting period of 10-15 percent inflation in the coming years. 
However, with such an inflation rate, there are realistic 
opportunities for settling and accelerating the economy. 
  On the other hand, it is necessary to considerable reduce 
over- distribution and the budget deficit. One can see today 
that we can only achieve economic consolidation, a 
venture-friendly economic environment, a better welfare network, 
and an improvement in the situation of pensioners (protecting 
the real value of pensions) if the budget deficit in the coming 
years is not lower or higher than 5 percent of the GDP. 
  With such a budget deficit, the international evaluation of 
the Hungarian economy can be lastingly positive, there will be 
no need to withdraw capital worth 150-190 billion forints from 
the economy, and this surplus income can contribute to the 
implementation of our development goals.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Proposed Program of the Liberal </F>
Bloc; No Thanks Are Due for Compensation"] 
  [Text] The first program reconciliation within the liberal 
bloc is scheduled to take place on 26 April. Delegates of the 
four parties will discuss and reconcile disputed issues 
regarding education, the economy, agricultural policy, and 
public safety on that day, according to a statement by Agrarian 
Alliance spokeswoman Klara Spilak at yesterday's news conference. 
  The following are the members of the permanent conference 
committee: Balint Nagy represents the Agrarian Alliance, Tamas 
Fellegi represents Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats], Csaba 
Csikos represents the Entrepreneurs' Party, and SZDSZ [Alliance 
of Free Democrats] is represented by Tamas Bauer and Balint 
Magyar. The SZDSZ will be in charge of presenting public safety 
issues, Fidesz will deal with educational issues, the 
Entrepreneurs' Party will present economic policy issues, and 
the Agrarian Alliance will be in charge of agricultural policy 
issues, of course. The leaders of the four parties intend to 
publicize accomplishments in each field before the elections. 
  Agrarian Alliance political campaign chief Gyorgy Fabri 
declared that the election struggle has not assumed a coarse 
tone of voice, but he objected to the fact that there was no 
opportunity to conduct real public debate, and he blamed 
primarily the public service media for that. Thereafter Fabri 
said that some positive changes have recently taken place in the 
TV-HIRADO and in various news programs. Regarding the dispute 
over the list of recipients of compensation, the campaign chief 
said that the release and use of these data was an unfortunate 
election trick, because the Agricultural Alliance believes that 
no thanks are due for compensation. 
  Erzsebet Schmuck, cochairman of the Green Alternative, 
distanced herself and her party from the Hungarian Green Party, 
and reaffirmed their professional and political cooperation with 
the Agrarian Alliance, a member of the liberal bloc.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, chairman of the Alliance of </F>
Free Democrats and the party's candidate for the position of 
prime minister, by Attila Zsoldos; place and date not given: 
"There Is a Chance for a Stable Coalition"] 
  [Text] Gabor Kuncze does not take it for granted that the 
parties' formulations on their coalition alliance possibilities 
will be of long duration. He regards these declaration as 
campaign tricks. In his view, the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] cannot achieve a worse result at the elections than 
second place. 
  [Zsoldos] In view of the latest opinion polls, do you see 
any chance of a stable government coalition after the elections? 
  [Kuncze] The opinion polls reflect trends. The election 
results will really show the coalition possibilities. With this 
restriction, my opinion is that there is a chance for a stable 
coalition after the elections. 
  [Zsoldos] Mutual exclusions could be heard from various 
political parties during the election campaign. The Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] excluded the possibility of a coalition 
with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the SZDSZ under 
the current leadership; the MDF had a similar position regarding 
the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. The Federation 
of Young Democrats [Fidesz] rejected the idea of a government 
coalition with the MSZP. These are only a few examples. Have 
the parties not narrowed their scope too much before the 
elections? 
  [Kuncze] Most of these exclusions are not more than campaign 
tricks. It is not worth dealing with them too much. These 
positions of the current government parties show that they would 
like to be in the opposition after the elections. They should 
not be hindered in this. 
  [Zsoldos] In other words, you would not take it for granted 
that these positions will last long? 
  [Kuncze] I do not generally take anything for granted, 
particularly not political issues. 
  [Zsoldos] There have been conflicts between the SZDSZ and 
the Fidesz lately, but you said that there are no unbridgeable 
differences of views between the two parties. Is it true? 
  [Kuncze] That is true. 
  [Zsoldos] Do you not regard the fact that the Fidesz 
excludes the possibility of a coalition with the MSZP while the 
SZDSZ does not exclude such a possibility as such an 
unbridgeable difference? 
  [Kuncze] The SZDSZ does not exclude the possibility of 
coalition with any democratic party, and I do not know of any 
such official position on the part of the Fidesz. Viktor Orban 
generally speaks about this in his own name. 
  [Zsoldos] Among other things, the SZDSZ focused its campaign 
on doing everything in its power for the best possible results 
of the liberal bloc and on making sure that a stable government 
coalition will emerge after the elections. Which of these two 
goals do you regard as more important? 
  [Kuncze] I think it is important for the liberal parties to 
achieve good results, but it is also important that, aware of 
the election results, the SZDSZ should examine the possibilities 
of coalition agreements. It is not justified now to set up an 
importance list. I will know the real possibilities in a few 
days. Let us wait until then. 
  [Zsoldos] Many people say, including the government parties, 
that the SZDSZ might disintegrate if it forms a coalition with a 
strong MSZP. 
  [Kuncze] Who said that the SZDSZ would form a coalition with 
a strong MSZP? Nor did anyone say that the SZDSZ would form a 
coalition with the MSZP at all. At the moment, all I can say is 
that we should wait for the election results. 
  [Zsoldos] What guarantees will the SZDSZ ask in exchange for 
its willingness to participate in the government coalition? 
  [Kuncze] We have already published our position, in which we 
formulated the coalition guidelines in 25 points. We will stick 
to these guidelines. 
  [Zsoldos] Could it be a guarantee that, in a given 
circumstance, the SZDSZ will provide the prime minister? 
  [Kuncze] The SZDSZ is not striving to achieve good results 
at the elections. If our hopes come true, we will consider 
this. This is only natural.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Statement by Alliance of Free </F>
Democrats Professionals: Insolvency Is Out of Question"] 
  [Text] SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] Representatives 
Gyula Gaal, Karoly Attila Soos, and Marton Tardos had this to 
say: "At a news conference on 19 April, Gyula Horn and Laszlo 
Bekesi (...) mentioned that a threat of insolvency exists in 
Hungary. We regard this supposition as unfortunate and 
groundless, the same way as we regard the shrill sound of the 
government's success propaganda coming from the other side. The 
fact is that the MNB [Hungarian National Bank] is successful in 
floating bonds in the international market place, and this 
fact--indicating confidence in our country--has not been changed 
even by the extraordinarily grave deterioration of our 
international balance of payments last year. (...) There is no 
basis for leaders of a party that prepares itself to play a role 
in governance, and to direct long-term processes, to make the 
above-quoted, oddly pessimistic statement."

<F P=106> [Interview with National Democratic Federation Chairman Imre </F>
Pozsgay by Pal Sombathy; place and date not given: "We Are Now 
More Courageous in Our Political Activity"] 
  [Text] In our series of interviews, head of parties 
that succeeded in presenting election lists are talking about 
their parties' programs and ideas. This time we interviewed 
National Democratic Federation [NDSZ] Chairman Imre Pozsgay, who 
said that Hungary needs a broad coalition. 
  [Szombathy] When establishing your party, you called it a 
center party open to the left and closed to the right. What 
program differences lie behind this unusual definition? 
  [Pozsgay] Our party is characterized by greater freedom and 
greater political courage. We can offer society program points 
that others also know about but, because of the limitations of 
their roles and the historical precedence, they do not have the 
possibility of speaking about. Why, otherwise, would the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] speak about a national 
coordination congress, a party that was forced to give up the 
program of constitutional national assembly? Why would a number 
of parties speak about debt reductions and debt diplomacy, while 
they were accepting the payment burdens as fate? The NDSZ did 
not get involved in any of these restrictions and, thus, it can 
be more open to various methods of treatment. We focus on 
values and methods, and we only accept ideological 
considerations when absolutely necessary. The essence of our 
new economic policy is that the time has come to place our 
national economy on a growth path and find sources necessary for 
economic progress. We need a new constitution that would create 
a consensus and unity, also in carrying out the budget and state 
administration reform. 
  [Szombathy] There are several parties that are talking about 
economic growth, but it seems that the issue of debt reduction 
is a taboo. What solutions does the NDSZ offer? 
  [Pozsgay] The Polish example clearly shows that it is not 
the changes in course that determines the opportunities of debt 
diplomacy. Under the ruins of the Soviet empire, we are the 
last who are still paying. We know the counterarguments, but 
this is only an excuse and a defense mostly on the part of those 
who have been handling this debt for the last 20 years, and 
their chances are connected to preserving this ideology. I 
consider the debt issue to be a badly treated economic policy 
affair. We should get rid of superstitions. At the same time, 
other parties promising economic growth mention new credits as 
the source of financing this growth. This is where we differ 
from them. We do not exclude the possibility of new foreign 
credits to the Hungarian economic development, but these credits 
must not appear as state debts. The country should determine 
the role of foreign debt, and not the other way round. 
  [Szombathy] How does the NDSZ's national character differ 
from that of the coalition and from that of other similar 
parties? 
  [Pozsgay] We do not live in the constant fear of moral 
danger to the nation. In our view, the community form of the 
accepting nation is well compatible with the conditions of 
modernization. Regarding the European integration institutions, 
the national awareness of Western European small countries like 
Denmark are exemplary for me. The Danes first rejected the 
Maastricht agreement, and then voted in favor, because their 
conditions of participation had been met. 
  [Szombathy] The MDF speaks of a leftist danger and Istvan 
Csurka called on the national forces to cooperate. What is your 
opinion of these efforts? Is the gathering of the national 
forces into a bloc necessary and is there any chance of 
restoration? 
  [Pozsgay] The danger of a leftist restoration does not 
exist. We are witnessing an information disturbance here, 
something understandable in a country in which the people lived 
through a change in the regime that took place without the 
people, and even against the people. However, I, myself, see a 
danger of revenge. I follow the appearance of people on the 
side of the left who should have been called to account for 
their deeds long ago with concern. However, this phenomenon is, 
to a certain extent, normal in the struggle of political forces. 
One should not sound the alarm because of this phenomenon, 
because this only increases its danger. The conditions for a 
national bloc are not met, because it is impossible to form a 
government only based on alarm. The coordination of programs 
failed to materialize; on the one hand, it is too early, on the 
other hand the alarm is late, an alarm that weakens precisely 
the center forces because of the distancing. Every phase of 
these elections must be carried out, and the lessons should be 
drawn after the elections. 
  [Szombathy] What role is your party facing after the 
elections? 
  [Pozsgay] The NDSZ will make it into Parliament, and I hope 
we will set up a faction. The 100,000 nomination slips gathered 
under an eventful campaign show that there will be voters for 
the NDSZ. Many figures coming from the real sphere accepted an 
NDSZ candidacy. The new parliament will be a split one, with 
many parties present in the National Assembly. The small 
parties will also participate in the coalition talks. The NDSZ 
does not wish to form a coalition with extremist forces. 
According to the experience so far, the new coalition should 
not be based on program coordination, because this would bring 
inadmissible compromises and subsequent blackmail conditions 
into the government. It is a much better method to agree on two 
or three basic tasks, like working out a new economic policy for 
the benefit of economic growth, social policy consolidation, and 
a new constitution. It is not worth accepting more than that 
for one legislative cycle.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Position Taken by the National </F>
Electoral Committee: The MDF Can Be Blamed Always, for 
Everything"] 
  [Text] Recently the National Electoral Committee [OVB] once 
again accused the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] of illegal 
conduct because it wanted to send letters to recipients of 
compensation, by taking advantage of an opportunity offered by 
the Compensation Office. The objection filed by the SZDSZ 
[Alliance of Free Democrats] was supported by the opposition 
members of the OVB, of course. 
  They did so, despite the fact that not only the largest 
ruling party, but also Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] 
and the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] purchased the list of 
voters participating in the 1990 elections; with respect to the 
letter to be sent to recipients of compensation, the 
Compensation Office also notified quite a few other parties, 
thus also the SZDSZ and the MSZP, offering the services of the 
Compensation Office to mail their campaign materials to 
recipients of compensation. Only the MDF took advantage of this 
offer however, and therefore the matter became the source of 
serious disputes. 
  We asked MSZP manager Andras Toth "why the MSZP condemns 
MDF's conduct, when nothing illegal is involved? The ruling 
party took advantage of an opportunity also offered to other 
parties, but the other parties did not take advantage of it." In 
his response Toth said that "The truth is that Tamas Sepsey sent 
a letter to us in March, offering the services of the 
Compensation Office in forwarding various campaign 
advertisements to recipients of compensation, but we regarded 
this offer as questionable from a legal standpoint, and as not 
serving our purpose, so we did not take advantage of the offer." 
Andras Toth added that he agreed that primarily the Compensation 
Office should be blamed, but the party taking advantage of an 
opportunity not provided for by law should be blamed for taking 
the action. 
  Insofar as the letters mailed to the 1990 voters is 
concerned, one should wait until a court pronounces an affirmed 
judgment regarding the OVB's related determination. Meanwhile, 
it would be appropriate for the MDF to stop mailing the letters, 
according to Toth, adding that the MSZP clearly viewed this as a 
legal, and not as a political, matter, i.e., that its objection 
did not amount to an attack on the ruling party.

<F P=106> ["B.A.P."-signed interview with Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of </F>
the Independent Smallholders' Party; place and date not given: 
"Jozsef Torgyan on National Cooperation -- The FKgP Would Defeat 
Communism"] 
  [Text] We continue our series in which the list leaders of 
parties give interviews, with the views of Jozsef Torgyan, 
chairman of the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKgP]. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] When the Hungarian Way Circles were formed, 
you published a communique in your periodical, the HO NAP, that 
these are the FKgP's own children. However, now you will not 
participate in the event organized by Istvan Csurka [cochairman 
of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, MIEP] which is to 
foster national cohesion. Why? 
  [Torgyan] The term Hungarian Way is the newspaper name of 
the 
FKgP's extended arm, the Hungarian Community. This community had 
such outstanding leaders as Balint Arany, who was an organizing 
secretary of our party. They fought against Nazism and later 
the Soviet Union. This is the reason I could not call the 
Hungarian Way Circles anything other than the FKgP's own 
children. At the same time, when the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF] was planned, the intention was to establish a substitute 
for the popular front. I am convinced that the whole peaceful 
process was preceded by an international agreement drawn up by 
the central committees of the given countries' communist 
parties, with the assistance of the KGB. In this structure, the 
role originally designed for the popular front was given to the 
Democratic Forum. After all this, Csurka talks about the MDF as 
the biggest force of national cohesion. In addition, he also 
invited parties like the Unified Smallholders' Party that had 
been sliced off from the FKgP. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] You mean the United Smallholders Party? 
  [Torgyan] It does not make any difference, its name will be 
forgotten after 8 May anyway. Csurka invited the forces that 
are trying to divide the right wing. I think that this step can 
only nominally serve the goal of uniting the right wing. In 
real terms, it serves to draw away the FKgP's forces. It 
clearly has to be seen that, today, only the FKgP is able to 
defeat communism. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] At the same time, according to the interior 
minister, Gyula Thurmer, the main domestic representative of 
communism, strengthened you. 
  [Torgyan] Please write it down in bold letters: The 
interior minister lied. If you do not print this then I will 
not let you print anything at all. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] According to a view published in a newspaper, 
your role is to attack the MDF and the communists at the same 
time, thus opening the way for the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ]. 
  [Torgyan] Every day I mention in my speeches that God save 
us from the hissing parties. The SZDSZ is a pseudo-opposition 
party because their main task is to preserve communism. A 
popular figure was placed at the SZDSZ's head to deceive people 
and to hide the party's real character. At the same time, we 
can also see clearly that Gabor Kuncze who was put there to 
deceive the public will soon be replaced by Gabor Fodor, who was 
brought in as a second man. I have to point out that they have 
lost their support in the provinces so, in addition to the MDF, 
the SZDSZ will be the other big loser of these elections. The 
FKgP was the only party that had the audacity to say that, 
rather than a change of the regime, a communist preservation had 
taken place in Hungary. The pseudo-democracy operated as a 
multiparty dictatorship. It is precisely the MDF that serves 
the purpose of making people learn to hate democracy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Imre Szekeres on the Official </F>
Position of the Hungarian Socialist Party; Stormy Socialist 
Debate"] 
  [Text] At yesterday's Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] news 
conference, managing vice chairman Imre Szekeres announced the 
official socialist position regarding statements made as part of 
the television program A HET, and reported on what he had 
learned during his trip to the United States and Canada. During 
his visit, the vice chairman met with a number of leading 
government officials and businessmen, including Democratic 
Representative Tom Lantos, Thomas Dine, chairman of the Foreign 
Investment Coordination Committee, and Republican Representative 
Benjamin Gilman. 
  In his introductory remarks Imre Szekeres said that 
according 
to indications, all political parties regard the MSZP as their 
chief opponent, and that this is understandable because the MSZP 
enjoys the broadest societal support. In contrast to 1990, 
political parties running in the present elections will have to 
accept the decisions made by voters, the vice chairman stressed. 
He added: The MSZP intends to take the place of the present 
coalition government, but contrary to certain statements, this 
does not mean the end of democracy. Relative to the program A 
HET, Szekeres said that in an unprecedented manner, the chairmen 
of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] and of Fidesz 
[Federation of Young Democrats] were asked to make statements 
relative to the MSZP; this was done in a manner that no elected 
officer of the socialists could express his position. In 
addition, by mentioning a possible dictatorship, party chairmen 
Lajos Fur and Viktor Orban offended the will of voters, and took 
the same position as Istvan Csurka. Matyas Szuros, who is not a 
member of a single elected MSZP body, expressed his own views 
only; these are not the same as the official situation analysis 
of the MSZP, and besides, he had no right to judge who could, 
and who could not be a party member, because he enjoys no 
support either from the party leadership or the membership, at 
least insofar as his statements are concerned. 
  In summarizing the experience gained during his trip to the 
United States, Imre Szekeres emphasized that representatives of 
political as well as business circles told him that they had no 
reservations whatsoever about a possible socialist government. 
The socialist politician reported on the MSZP's foreign policy 
and economic policy goals, and on the situation that evolved in 
and around the Hungarian public service media. According to 
investors and economists, the economic situation is Hungary is 
extremely critical, and therefore there is a need for changes, 
and for a strong and effective state to resolve the problems, 
Szekeres said. In answering questions on anti-Semitism, the vice 
chairman had reassuring words to say. He made it clear that 
anti-Semitism in Hungary is not at all stronger than in West 
Europe, and that political anti-Semitism is not unmanageable 
either, but having said that, every means must be used to combat 
anti-Semitism.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Broker Scandals Must Be </F>
Avoided"] 
  [Text] "The utilization of the surplus of financial 
institutions must be regulated, and this has been made 
especially timely by the case of the Lupis Brokerage," Lajos 
Kosa, parliamentary representative for Fidesz [Federation of 
Young Democrats] said. In this case, the state, and indirectly 
the citizens, suffered a loss. But this was not the first such 
scandal, because when the Ybl Bank went bankrupt, almost 2 
million forints from budgetary institutions were lost. 
  In the opinion of Fidesz, the financing of the institutions 
cannot be regulated in such a way that they would have no 
surplus at all from time to time. But if they do have a surplus, 
it is expedient to invest it, and in such a way that the money 
would be in the safest possible place. In the opinion of Fidesz 
it would be desirable for budgetary institutions to invest only 
in treasury bonds and other government bonds.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Tuition Concept of the </F>
Federation of Young Democrats: Investment in the Future"] 
  [Text] The introduction of requirements to pay tuition in 
higher education is unavoidable, according to Fidesz [Federation 
of Young Democrats], but tuition should not be charged during 
the academic year 1994/95. Subject to gradual introduction, the 
amount of tuition to be charged should not exclude youths of 
lesser means from having an opportunity to continue their 
education, according to Janos Mazsu, one of the framers of 
Fidesz's higher education program, at the party's news 
conference last Thursday [14 April]. 
  Janos Mazsu believes that the matter of charging tuition may 
once again become an issue because the higher education law 
adopted by parliament requires the introduction of tuition 
payments in the next academic year, and the budget law includes 
tuition as part of revenues to be collected by institutions of 
higher education. The proposed decree drafted by the Culture 
Ministry calls for a uniform 2,000-forint-per-month tuition 
after 1994, payable by students at the start of each semester. 
The decree would permit universities and academies to grant 
exemptions from under tuition payments up to 10 percent of their 
revenues. Fidesz, on the other hand, believes that requirements 
for tuition payments should be introduced gradually, and that 
the amount of tuition should not be determined in terms of 
uniform sums of money, but instead within a minimum and maximum 
amount of tuition determined by the state, the institutions 
themselves should determine the exact amount of tuition to be 
paid, in concurrence with the student governing bodies. Fidesz 
would establish a wide-ranging subsidy system for students 
experiencing difficulties because of the cost of living and for 
having to pay membership dues; the system would also provide 
several ways of financing, ranging from exemptions from under 
the payment of tuition to social welfare subsidies. 
  Reporting on Fidesz's foreign language concept, Zoltan 
Pokorni, the head of Fidesz's education cabinet, stressed that 
Hungary's educational system still lacked 32,000 foreign 
language instructors. Their number could be effectively 
increased by introducing an opportunity for bilevel wage 
negotiations, and by paying the instructors appropriate 
salaries, a result of which they would not be forced to abandon 
their careers as educators.

<F P=106> [Article by Irene Szabo: "Law on Informers: Legal Qualms; </F>
Deadline for President To Sign Expires on 2 April"] 
  [Text] The National Assembly introduced the bill on "the 
scrutiny of individuals in certain important positions," 
popularly called the law on informers, "in order to enhance the 
purity of the democratic political order," and passed it on 8 
March 1992. The text of the law is on the desk of the president 
of the Republic, and the deadline for Arpad Goncz to make a 
decision concerning the law is 2 April. Constitutional lawyers 
informed us that constitutional and professional problems arose 
in connection with law No. 8955. 
  During the four-year term of the Hungarian National 
Assembly, 
perhaps the most and the loudest discussion surrounded the issue 
whether society must be purged of former secret agents, i.e., 
how could one filter out informers of the former regime from 
among individuals in important positions. The annals record two 
major cases: The envelope calvary of the Smallholder Jozsef 
Torgyan, and the case of Istvan Csurka, former vice chairman of 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], currently copresident of 
the Hungarian Life and Truth Party [MIEP], who "made himself 
transparent" before the public in a way which one could call a 
masterstroke of dramatic art. 
  After the wrangle of arguments and counterarguments, in the 
beginning of March, parliament finally passed the III/III law, 
the preamble of which contains the following: "The National 
Assembly" acted "in order to enhance the purity of the 
democratic political order." The opinion arose among 
constitutional lawyers that the text of the law is problematic 
for several reasons. In their opinion, the first large group of 
problems concerns discrimination. Namely, Paragraph 70/A of the 
Constitution forbids any kind of discrimination between one 
person and another. The Constitutional Court explained in 
several decisions that one must examine in an objective and 
subjective context whether forbidden discrimination is present. 
In view of this, the law becomes a constitutional problem, 
because it does not apply to the entire network of secret 
agents, only to individuals in the network of the III/III 
Department. 
  According to experts, the selection of the group of 
individuals to be scrutinized presents a problem as well. For 
instance, the different treatment of church officials and the 
control of individuals employed by private employers is 
disputable. The problem with including universities is that in 
terms of the law on higher education they are regarded as 
autonomous public service institutions, and state-owned 
businesses are not even part of the political order, because in 
them the state is present not as a state organ, and not as an 
instance of the state's sovereignty, but rather as one of the 
owners in a market economy. 
  From the point of view of professionality and 
constitutionality it is problematic that the law places the 
examination in the hands of a three-member committee consisting 
of judges, acting not in the capacity of judges, who are allowed 
to utilize "any legal evidence." At the same time the process is 
closed, which results in the lack of legal guarantees. It is 
problematic that if these are not court proceedings, how can 
evidence that is applicable in court proceedings be utilized in 
a legal way. Beyond the legal status of the members of the 
committee, their decision, which is actually a sentence, is also 
debatable. It is to be feared that objectivity will be hampered 
if the committee's activity is centered on the Interior 
Ministry, which submits the material for examination, and 
lawyers also consider it absurd if following the decision 
charges must be brought against the ministry. 
  The experts noted as a grave constitutional problem that the 
right to appeal to a court is excluded. The Constitution lists 
among basic human rights the right of any defendant to request 
that his case "be decided by a lawfully established independent 
and neutral court in a just and open trial." Personal rights are 
absolute rights. They are not subject to the statute of 
limitations. And if the above-mentioned committee comes to the 
negative conclusion that the individual under examination has a 
"past" which is subject to the law on informers, and orders him 
to resign from his office or position, then it is restricting 
two fundamental rights. The first one is the fundamental right 
of citizens to serve in a public office, or to exercise their 
free choice of work and profession, and the second one is the 
fundamental right of citizens to human dignity, and within it, 
to a good reputation. 
  Lawyers see the essential internal contradiction of the 
III/III law in the fact that its enforceability and practicality 
is debatable. Today one is justified in asking whether the lists 
are genuine or manipulated.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Timetable of Bond Issues; Government </F>
Bonds for 250 Billion Forints"] 
  [Text] According to the budget passed by parliament, this 
year the budget deficit is expected to be 329.56 billion forints 
[Ft]. The demand for financing is less than that, and the 
Finance Ministry wants to come up with the necessary money 
primarily by issuing government bonds. As the Hungarian News 
Agency [MTI] reports, starting in March, each month new 
government bonds in the value of Ft15-25 billion will be issued. 
The issue will generally take place in the first week of each 
month. As a result, this year public government bonds will be 
issued in the value of Ft250 billion. The law allows the issue 
of Ft300 billion. 
  Of this amount, Ft69.2 billion will be used to service 
credits and to renew government bonds that are due to expire. 
Thus, the issue of medium and long-term bonds in order to 
finance the deficit will amount to Ft180 billion. Starting in 
April, foreigners will also be eligible to buy government bonds, 
for forints. 
  The issue of treasury bonds will continue according to the 
previously established system. The sale of interest-bearing 
treasury bonds will take place in the third week of each month, 
after a week-long registration period, and the amount issued 
will depend on the demand. Treasury bonds to the population will 
continue to be sold by designated branch offices of the National 
Savings Bank [OTP] and the Budapest Bank. Issue will be 
determined by demand in this case, as well. Every Wednesday an 
auction of 30-day discount treasury bonds will be held, at which 
the advertised amount is expected to be Ft6-10 billion. Every 
other Tuesday, an auction of 90-day discount treasury bonds is 
planned, where the advertised amount will be Ft8-10 billion. On 
the last Thursday of each month, an auction of 180-day discount 
treasury bonds will be held, at which bonds will be offered in 
the value of Ft10-15 billion. Finally, every other month, on the 
last Friday of the given month, an auction of 360-day discount 
treasury bonds will be held, where Ft15 billion will be offered.

<F P=106> [Article by L.N.: "Pongracz Opposes State Guarantees to </F>
Banks"] 
  [Text] A mood of pogrom arose against the State Property 
Agency [AVU] and the State Property Management Corporation 
[AVRT]; the program of some politicians consists merely of 
attacking privatization, or rather, the two institutions, State 
Secretary Tibor Pongracz told MAGYAR HIRLAP. 
  However, he emphasized, these are not the only institutions 
for privatization. In his opinion, it is here that one can find 
the most reliable data both about the size of the property and 
the process of privatization. He finds it strange that no one is 
requesting data about the size and the fate of property in the 
hands of local governments, the treasury property manager, or 
the cooperatives. Incidentally, at its latest meeting, the board 
of directors of AVU decided to prepare for parliament the list 
of state firms privatized up to now, as requested by Zoltan 
Kiraly. 
  Tibor Pongracz drew attention to spontaneous privatization 
that started at the time of the previous government, and noted 
that in order to see clearly one should give an account to 
parliament and the public about that process, as well. He noted 
that AVU was established by the Socialists, but they never drew 
up a property list. 
  The state secretary regards privatization as a fundamental 
issue for the economy, and as he put it, "if politicians during 
the campaign turn it into a prostitute, it will be difficult to 
turn it into a nun in a few months." 
  The state secretary does not agree with the latest proposal 
by the board of directors of the AVRT, namely that in the second 
segment of providing the banks with capital the state should 
supply them not with money, but with guarantees. As he said, 
this would lead to a process in which the banks would completely 
exploit the firms, drive them to ruin, and then hand in the bill 
to the government.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sarlos Claims Centrum"] </F>
  [Text] Canadian businessman Andrew Sarlos will arrive in 
Hungary next week and, from what we have heard, he intends to 
raise the 5-billion-forint [Ft] capital of the Centrum 
Department Store Company by more than Ft2 billion. 
  The present visit by Sarlos, who represents a group of 
Canadian investors, could have a special significance because an 
agreement is expected to be reached within a few weeks between 
the State Property Agency and the department store chain. As is 
well known, the mbo [management buy-out] and mrp [worker share 
program] organization is going to buy 51 percent of the shares 
in the value of Ft2.5 billion. 
  The investors had several alternatives to come up with the 
necessary amount. Of these, the leadership of the Centrum 
mrp-mbo organization accepted a version which was familiar to 
many people: They will take out a business loan in the amount of 
Ft1.3 billion from the Bank of Commerce, and they intend to pay 
for the remaining Ft1.2 billion with compensation vouchers and 
cash. According to the present state of affairs, cash in the 
amount of Ft420 million was collected, and the employees intend 
to buy shares for compensation vouchers in the value of Ft756 
million. 
  The employees can receive dividends only after the debt is 
repaid, which, in an extreme case, can take as long as 18 years, 
we learned from Gyula Galla, trade union secretary of the 
Centrum Department Store Company. Since Hungarian law at the 
present does not allow the payment of dividends as long as the 
business has outstanding debts, Centrum will not be able to pay 
dividends until it has paid back its loans. This means that 
there is a chance that the approximately 4,000 employees who 
will obtain property through privatization will have no access 
to profit from the company's operation for 18 years. At the same 
time, they cannot sell the company's shares as long as there is 
a debt. 
  Galla emphasized that they do not plan to downsize in the 
long run.

  [Text] Warsaw, 5 May--In a telephone conversation with a 
reporter from Polish Radio Three on Thursday, Zygmunt Wrzodak, 
head of Solidarity in the Ursus tractor factory, said that one 
should not hold talks with the present government but should 
form strong structures attached to the Solidarity National 
Commission, which will form an interim government in the future. 
  "The government has to be given an ultimatum: If it wants to 
talk, then it should sit at the table and negotiate and fix some 
dates for things to be solved. If not, then we have to remove 
those people from the government and replace this government 
with an interim one," he said. 
  According to Wrzodak, this is the opinion of a few people 
from factory commissions in Mazowsze region, but the Solidarity 
National Commission should make a decision. In his opinion, all 
strikes should be clearly and properly coordinated.

particular industry but also to the whole state. That is why 
the president is saying that one must consider whether all of 
the industries should strike when this could bring a halt to the

power but at finding economic solutions. The president thinks 
that, in such a situation, the talks must be continued because 
nothing can happen without them. [end recording]

Trade Secretary Ronald Brown, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
said that he hopes better conditions for full economic

<F P=106> [Interview with Adam Struzik, speaker of the Senate of the </F>
Polish Republic, by correspondent Anna Fastnacht-Stupnicka; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Before the latest 
parliamentary election, there was talk in the Polish Peasant 
Party [PSL] about dissolving the Senate. 
  [Struzik] To be more precise, the talk was about the need to 
transform the Senate into a parliamentary chamber representing 
local self-government structures. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] The debate on this subject has died 
down now. Do you view it differently these days? 
  [Struzik] The debate has not died down, and I have to answer 
this particular question at least once every few days. We 
recently organized a conference on local self-government for 
parish aldermen, city mayors, and PSL deputies. At the end of 
the conference, our deputies issued a resolution declaring that 
we would strive to transform the Senate into a chamber 
representing local self-government. The simplest way to do this 
is to introduce a provision into the electoral law enabling 
local self-government representatives to run for the Senate in 
parliamentary elections. It is not difficult to do, but we are 
currently preparing for a constitutional debate, which should 
take place soon, and to decide whether we want to have a 
two-chamber parliament. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] What position will you take in that 
debate? 
  [Struzik] I am in favor of the second chamber representing 
local self-government structures while retaining its present 
constitutional rights. I believe that, in this way, we could 
ensure that local self-government structures exert real 
influence on the legislative process in our country. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Minister Miller said recently: "The 
reason we have our own senators in the Senate is to enable them 
to weaken that body from within." Have you yourself seen any 
evidence of such action on the part of senators representing the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] group? 
  [Struzik] Not only have I not seen any such evidence, I 
actually witnessed the extreme indignation with which SLD 
senators reacted to Mr. Miller's utterance. Indeed, they chose 
to distance themselves from his words. I must say that the 37 
SLD senators are far from idle in the Senate. Their contribution 
to its work is most valuable and useful. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] The Senate kept out of the latest 
conflict between the Belweder and the government coalition. It 
could even be said that you took a position at some distance 
from the fray and only watched and waited for its outcome--with 
you yourself, as Senate speaker, acting as the principal 
observer. 
  [Struzik] This was to some extent the result of the fact 
that the political climate in the Senate is slightly more 
moderate than in the Sejm. As far as this particular case was 
concerned, I applied my own personal philosophy as a politician. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Could you disclose its principles to 
us? 
  [Struzik] First, I am pragmatic as a politician; second, I 
believe in keeping calm and maintaining a commonsense attitude. 
The conflict in question erupted very rapidly, and, when the 
president stated that he would aim for dissolution of 
parliament, I declared unequivocally that, as Senate speaker, I 
could and would not acknowledge or approve any decisions by the 
president tantamount to a breach of the laws in force. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Does this mean that you were 
prepared to ignore the president's decision and carry on with 
the Senate sessions? 
  [Struzik] It means precisely that. Unless, of course, I was 
interned. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] How do you assess the present 
political situation--the continuous arguments between the 
government coalition and the Belweder, and the balancing act 
performed by Prime Minister Pawlak between the coalition and the 
president? 
  [Struzik] Well, you see, politics is like a game of 
chess--indeed--like a major "simultaneous" game because it is 
often played on several boards at once. People should really 
appreciate this. For many decades, Polish society, 
including--and I trust you are not going to take offense 
here--journalistic circles, was trained to take a unanimous view 
over virtually everything. But then an unprecedented condition 
of democracy erupted among us, and everyone felt free to quarrel 
with everyone else. Now we are making slow progress toward a 
more normal state of affairs, and, in my opinion, we must learn 
to distinguish between real problems that we must solve and 
certain stratagems typical of the political game. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Society take a very critical view of 
these games. Opinion polls among our readers demonstrate that 
people are not even remotely interested in the warfare going on 
"at the top"; worse, they are getting impatient with them. They 
are interested in their daily lives, and they do not wish to be 
pawns that are forever moved about on the political chessboard. 
  [Struzik] We must understand that, too. However, to do 
this, we must first change our mentality and abandon for good 
the accustomed way of picturing the people who run the country 
as "them," as opposed to "us." After all, we had a democratic 
election, and it is the representatives of the people who are 
running things now. Just as society is varied in its political 
views, so are its representatives varied in theirs. They must 
be able to articulate these views. The only thing we must 
ensure is that the end result of their disputes is constructive 
and not destructive. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] I believe that these disputes would 
not annoy us so much if we had a stable economic situation. As 
it is, however, all the time and energies of these 
representatives of the people are wasted on mutual struggles and 
skirmishes instead of being usefully engaged in sorting out the 
country's problems. That is something the voters can be 
justifiably resentful about. 
  [Struzik] I would not agree with this view because we have 
recorded regular economic growth over the first three months of 
this year, inflation is lower than expected, and our debts have 
been reduced through the assistance of the Paris Club and the 
London Club. We neither notice nor appreciate these changes 
properly. It is true that there are still areas in which 
political quarrels abound, but the people will be able to assess 
these properly when the next election comes along. Please note 
that those who expressed extreme views in the previous elections 
have been effectively prevented from running again. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Mr. Speaker, are you not afraid that, 
once a compromise is reached between the president and the SLD, 
the position of the latter will be strengthened, and the PSL 
with Prime Minister Pawlak will be pushed aside and forced to 
take a back seat? 
  [Struzik] Oddly enough, it so happens that the position 
attributed to the PSL is either confrontation with the Belweder 
or collaboration with the president and opposition to the SLD. 
You yourself have been influenced by this way of viewing its 
position. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Is it not a correct viewpoint? 
  [Struzik] No. Let us look at it from a different 
perspective: The PSL is a sovereign party of a typically center 
position, a party of common sense and the middle way. It has a 
chance of developing into a large and very strong party of a 
Christian democratic type. Therefore, we cannot assume a 
unanimous position with the SLD: It has different roots. I will 
not deny that a minor game of chess is being played here, too, 
but it is not a question of who can cheat the opponent better. 
Rather, it is a question of different outlooks. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] If I understand you correctly, your 
party is at the moment forced by circumstances to exist in 
coalition with the SLD, but you are doing everything in your 
power to stop the public from identifying you with the Alliance 
and, instead, treat you as a separate, independent force. 
  [Struzik] I would not draw such far-reaching conclusions. 
I would rather say that things are the other way round: The 
PSL can function just as well in a center-left as in a 
center-right configuration. My view is that it is not the PSL 
that is forced by circumstances to exist within a coalition. In 
the previous arrangement of power and political forces, we 
actually functioned in opposition. That was our situation for a 
short while under the Olszewski government. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] But now you are in power, and, if you 
want to keep it, you can only achieve this in coalition with the 
SLD. 
  [Struzik] I think that neither of our two political groups 
has any alternative. On this point I would agree with you: The 
coalition is, in a sense, dictated by necessity. We talk of 
building a democratic system in Poland, introducing changes in 
the economy, or promulgating a new constitution: But we can 
only do it if and when we have a definite majority in the Sejm 
and the Senate. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Mr. Speaker, during a press conference 
in Opole, you said that Poland now faces a major opportunity, 
but we must want to take advantage of it. 
  [Struzik] If I did not feel and believe this very deeply, I 
could not be discharging my present function. I often play host 
to representatives of major Western firms, I receive ambassadors 
and heads of state, and they speak of the changes they see in 
Poland now, the perceptible progress, the building of a 
democratic system, the transformations in the economy. Apart 
from this, we are now, after many years, a free country again: 
We can realize our own destiny. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Do you not get the impression that our 
public has been a bit too quick to forget that we have regained 
our freedom? 
  [Struzik] Yes, it has forgotten. Just as it has forgotten 
what democracy means. Some say we could do with an "iron fist" 
rule now. This is not true. Have they already forgotten the 
days when they could not say what they thought? They could only 
think it and curse the reality in silence. However, you cannot 
maintain that the past was all grim and black. Many of us 
gained our education in those times; we built roads, hospitals, 
and universities. We must judge reality fairly and objectively. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] What will the PSL promise its voters 
before the local self-government elections? 
  [Struzik] First of all that there is a good chance that the 
needs of their local communities will be met and that they will 
have exactly as much as they are prepared to do themselves. 
What can we promise them? Instead of promising them things, we 
will rather speak of administering Poland together, of the fact 
that it is perfectly possible to assume responsibility for their 
parishes--that is, their "little homelands"--and change them for 
the better. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Thank you for talking to us.

<F P=106> [Article by E.Cz. and E.K.: "Government Versus Media; </F>
Everyone Bad, Television the Worst"] 
  [Text] The most recent conflict between the prime minister 
and television has been the classic example of a case that, by 
virtue of the law, should be handled by the National Council of 
Radio and Television [KRRiT]. The council has already expressed 
its desire to deal with the issue; it has been in a state of 
alert for a week. However, none of the parties of the conflict 
have requested it to take a stand. Therefore, KRRiT itself 
asked Waldemar Pawlak whether the fragment of his Sejm speech, 
in which he criticized the mass media and accused them of 
censuring government communiques, might be treated as an 
official complaint. If so, KRRiT will look into the conflict 
and assess who was right. 
<H5>  Who Has the Right To Criticize </H5>
  Relations between the government and the media are based on 
strange principles. The government, via its Press Office, 
informs only about whatever it wants, and it often evades 
journalists' questions. For example, a day before the general 
strike of Solidarity, instead of hearing a commentary, 
journalists were sent from one minister to another, from a 
minister to the prime minister, from the prime minister to the 
communique, which was finally signed by the director of the 
Government Press Office. Such policy is facilitated by the lack 
of a press spokesman. It is not the spokesman but the ministers 
themselves that should represent their policy, Minister Michal 
Strak stated in the Sejm. At the same time, the government 
wants the media to issue information about everything it does, 
regardless of the gravity of the matters, statements, visits. 
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak has several times voiced his 
dissatisfaction with the fact that his speeches are not 
published in their entirety, that the television broadcasts only 
brief summaries of events concerning him. In important 
situations, when asked about a comment, he himself evades 
answers. 
<H5>  Luckily, There Is Television </H5>
  For some time now, the attack on the media has been 
stronger; 
politicians have been complaining mostly about the television. 
Minister Michal Strak keeps asking for special "windows" for the 
government, for Labor Minister Leszek Miller, who, when he took 
over the office, officially gave up the television succession 
from Jacek Kuron. Right now, he is discussing this matter with 
Television President Wieslaw Walendziak by mail. The television 
president agrees to prepare jointly the programs concerning the 
most important issues related to social policy; however, he 
consistently refuses to grant any "windows" to politicians. 
  The most resounding conflict so far has been the one between 
the prime minister and "Wiadomosci" over the reading of the 
entire governmental communique concerning the strikes. The 
television employees admit that the government is exerting the 
greatest pressure on information programs. As for public 
affairs programs in the first program of the television, 
including the "Bilans" ["Balance"] program, the Government Press 
Office is for the time being submitting merely remarks. 
Walendziak's Adviser Rafal Matyja admits that political 
pressure on the television is quite frequent, but its directors 
do not want to publicize this. Most of it can be handled by the 
television itself. Only the most serious pressure, exerted most 
brutally, leaks outside. 
  KRRiT member Andrzej Zarebski concedes that, as a result of 
the recent tensions around the television, KRRiT must "again 
lean over" the provisions of the law on radio and television 
that pertain to the possibility of making it possible to "the 
chief organs of the state to present directly and explain the 
state policy on the radio and television." This may alter the 
content of the KRRiT disposition in this matter, which has been 
prepared but not yet announced. 
  The pressure has not so far been exerted to the still 
state-owned Polish Press Agency [PAP]. The PAP journalists say: 
Luckily, there is the television. The various governments, 
except for the Olszewski Cabinet, understood that this is only 
an information agency. 
<H5>  Hand in Hand </H5>
  It is hard to tell whether there is a joint information 
policy of the coalition. Both the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] have their own vision 
and experience in contacts with the media. They only go "hand 
in hand" as far as criticizing the media, especially the 
television, is concerned. Not long ago, Aleksander Kwasniewski 
admitted that a lot more is being written about the left than a 
year ago, which is understandable. "However, if anyone thinks 
that this is because of well-wishing, he is naive," Kwasniewski 
believes. However, he calls this attitude of the media toward 
the left a constant element of the political game. Criticism 
became stronger as reports on the Solidarity strikes appeared. 
The coalition politicians unanimously accuse journalists of 
heating the strike atmosphere. As usual, television receives 
the greatest rap on the knuckles. 
  The PSL, which does not have a daily or a major weekly and 
which has always complained about the negative attitude of the 
media toward them, hoped to improve this image when it came to 
power. The SLD, which can always count on TRYBUNA, has not so 
far turned it into a source of solid, firsthand information. It 
seems that its politicians are more interested in the image 
presented in media other than TRYBUNA. 
  The PSL, apart from complaints of a purely political nature, 
is also criticizing the programs of the television Agricultural 
Section. PSL Deputy President Franciszek Stafaniuk complained in 
a letter to the television directors that the journalists 
present the arguments of the consumers, not of the peasants, 
that they are not propeasant, and, finally, that they devote too 
much attention to general information instead of typically 
agricultural affairs. Politicians, on the other hand, are 
trying to see to it that such people and not others are invited 
to the studio. Agricultural Section Director Leszek Spalinski 
admits that the source of the differences between his team and 
part of the PSL is the outlook on the future of agriculture. 
The team is in favor of changes, transformations of the 
structure of the rural areas, while some of the PSL politicians 
want to maintain the status quo. 
<H5>  Search Within a Small Circle </H5>
  Rafal Matyja believes that, among such conflicts, the model 
of public television and its relation with the world of politics 
is being created. The definition and the role of public 
television in a democratic state will be the subject of a 
seminar that is scheduled for Friday [6 May]. Participating in 
the seminar will be members of the Board of Directors and the 
Supervisory Board of the television and KRRiT members. 
Journalists will not participate.

  [Text] Warsaw, 5 May (PAP)--Deputy Prime Minister [and 
finance minister] Grzegorz Kolodko today assured business 
representatives from 17 countries taking part in the East-West 
Business Forum in Warsaw that Poland has had quite good economic 
results and the economy has good prospects for further 
development. 
  Kolodko stressed that reforms in Poland are running on four 
tracks, but the main aim is the liberalization of the Polish 
economy supported by privatization. "We must bring the Polish 
economy from stabilization to economic growth. The hard work of 
society, the wise economic policy of the governing circles, and 
promotion of the habit of saving to increase the means for 
investment are necessary to achieve this aim. There cannot be a 
good market economy without a wise and stable economic policy, 
which the coalition government is set to develop and to build a 
good environment for doing business," Kolodko said.

<F P=106> [Article by Pawel Wronski: "MON Proposals--Calls for a </F>
Commander"] 
  [Text] According to National Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk, the Polish Army needs a chief commander. He does 
not know whether the commander will be subordinated to the 
Ministry of National Defense [MON] or directly to the president. 
Yesterday, the government adopted a draft of changes in the 
Army prepared by MON. 
  The document entitled "Defense Problems and Military Aspects 
of the Polish Republic's Security Policies" was debated by the 
government during a secret meeting with the participation of 
President Lech Walesa and General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the 
General Staff. After it is approved by the president and the 
Council of Ministers, the draft will be submitted to the Sejm 
before the end of May. 
<H5>  What Kind of Commander? </H5>
  The draft says that the civilian defense minister will cease 
being the Army's direct commander. A post of chief commander 
will be established who will be responsible for training and 
mobilization. He is supposed to be in charge of land forces, 
air forces, the Navy, and the General Staff. 
  It is not known whether the chief commander will be 
subordinated directly to the president or to the defense 
minister. Minister Kolodziejczyk did not hide the fact that the 
problem is of constitutional importance. "We leave the 
resolution of this issue up to the politicians," he said. 
  According to Kolodziejczyk, the Sejm will find it easier to 
approve the version under which the chief commander would be 
subordinated to the minister. If the commander were to be 
subordinated to the president, one would have to include that 
function in the Constitution and make the commander responsible 
for the Army's combat readiness. "The coalition will not agree 
to tinkering with the Small Constitution while a `big 
constitution' is still not in place," the MON chief explained to 
journalists. 
  Up to now, it has seemed that the Belweder has striven to 
have direct supervision over the Army and that the minister 
supports these plans. But Minister Kolodziejczyk said yesterday 
that the president's position on this issue is "very pragmatic." 
"He is eager to establish the kind of system of commanding the 
Army that would contain a safeguard protecting against 
destabilization and sudden political changes," Kolodziejczyk 
added. As an example, he cited the year 1992, when a conflict 
occurred between the president and Minister Jan Parys. 
  "So the point is for the president to have supervision over 
the chief commander?" asked confused journalists. "My 
understanding was the opposite of that," Kolodziejczyk replied. 
<H5>  What Kind of Guard? </H5>
  The Belweder-promoted idea of establishing a National 
Security Council as the chief organ of state security has been 
postponed indefinitely. The argument was that, as Kolodziejczyk 
explained it, one would have to "tinker with the Constitution." 
  Instead, the MON draft envisages the establishment of a 
National Guard, of which the basis would be formed by several 
thousand troops of the Internal Affairs Ministry's Nadwislanskie 
Units. But the guard would be subordinated not to the 
president, as the Belvedere wanted, but to civilian defense 
(that is, to MON) and would provide assistance during natural 
disasters, among others. 
<H5>  What Kind of Army? </H5>
  The document contains a list of legal acts concerning the 
Army, which the Sejm should adopt in the immediate future, as 
well as a report on the Army's technical condition. According 
to the minister, the Army's technical condition is "dangerous," 
and Poland may lose its credibility. "Shortly, nobody will 
simply appreciate us as a partner," the minister warned.

  [Text] President Arpad Goncz advises that on 8 May, voting 
citizens should compare their experiences of the past four years 
with the promises heard during the campaign, and that they 
should then vote on this basis. According to the head of state, 
when deciding about the individual candidates, what voters must 
weigh up is whether they have served well the interests of their 
immediate communities and whether their private lives are in 
order. 
  The president of the Republic, in his speech on radio 
tonight, thought it important to stress that no one can question 
the voters' choice of party. 
  Arpad Goncz hopes that as a result of the elections, a 
government will be formed which enjoys the trust of the majority 
of citizens, but which also takes minority opinions into 
consideration, one that fosters the national traditions and that 
is ready for interest coordination, and one that strives for 
social justice. 
  The head of state affirmed that for his part he will do 
everything in order that Hungary should have a parliament that 
is ready to serve and a government that observes freedom, the 
well-being and prosperity of every person, as well as the vital 
interests of all Hungarians.

  [Text] Following the first round of the parliamentary 
elections, the polling stations are now being closed. It is 
certain that the round of voting was valid because Zoltan Toth, 
head of the national election office, said more than half of the 
electorate had turned out to vote. 
  In the meantime, partial turnout figures for the evening 
have 
come in from 12 counties. According to these, the turnout in 
Baranya is 65 percent; in Bekes 66 percent; in Fejer 67 percent; 
in Gyoer-Moson-Sopron 73 percent; in Hajdu-Bihar 62 percent; in 
Heves 70 percent; in Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok 66 percent; in Nograd 
68 percent; in Komarom-Esztergom 68 percent; in Tolna 63 
percent; in Vas 72 percent, and in Veszprem 78 percent. Arpad 
Toth, expert from the national election office, in reply to a 
question from Hungarian Radio, said that there had been no 
reports of irregularities. However, there had been some reports 
from voters about a breach of the campaign ban. People had 
phoned in with objections to the fact that pollsters had 
questioned voters lining up to cast their vote, although those 
commissioned to make enquiries should have done so only in 
private. 
  The national election office also heard that a Fidesz 
[Federation of Young Democrats] advertisement had appeared in 
the television supplement of today's issue of the paper MAI NAP, 
during the period of the campaign ban. The voters had also 
objected to the fact that Gyoergy Szabad, outgoing speaker of 
the National Assembly and leading figure of the MDF [Hungarian 
Democratic Forum], had spoken on television, even if in the 
capacity of a historian.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Let us hear Levente Suekoesd's 
report from the headquarters of the Christian Democratic 
People's Party [KDNP]. 
  [Suekoesd] Good evening. The atmosphere is quiet and calm 
here. [passage omitted] The party's chairman, who has just 
arrived, is not in a very good mood. What do you think of the 
results so far? 
  [KDNP Chairman Laszlo Surjan] I think that many people are 
surprised by the partial results indicating an absolute lead by 
the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]. According to our 
analysis, the MSZP's program and its present leadership does not 
justify this result at all. However, nostalgia -- wanting to 
bring back the calm of the 70's and the 80's -- can explain 
this. I think that those who have chosen the Socialists from 
the current political forces for this reason are mistaken. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Suekoesd] Where did your party do well, in the larger towns 
or in the provinces? 
  [Surjan] In my view, it is unequivocal that our party's 
strength lies in the smaller towns and villages. The party was 
not strong in Budapest even in the 40's and it seems that this 
is the same in the 90's too. All this means that we have to 
deal with strengthening and building the party before the local 
government elections. 
  [Suekoesd] What can the second round bring? 
  [Surjan] The second round could bring extremely significant 
changes. [passage omitted] Although it is true that in 1990 
those leading after the first round kept their lead, this is not 
necessarily true. I think that the next three weeks will be 
spent trying to concentrate the forces in a way that a left-wing 
turnabout, which does not lead forward but back to the past, be 
held back or prevented.

  [Text] Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], which, according to the 
results so far, is in the lead, evaluated the first round of the 
elections at party headquarters in Republic Square. 
  [Begin Szekeres recording] Something important has happened 
today in Hungary. At the second free elections, finally, and 
once and for all, Hungary has became a democratic country. Very 
many citizens, much more than expected, have participated in the 
elections and no significant irregularity occurred today. 
Whatever the result of the elections, the point is that this 
decision has been made: Hungary, once and for all, became a 
democratic country. 
  The MSZP hopes that when the ballot boxes are opened and the 
votes counted, it will be the MSZP with the largest number of 
votes. We hope that in the next three weeks the style and 
content of the election campaign will change. We decided to 
maintain the style, political content, and ideology that have 
been represented by the MSZP candidates in the past weeks. This 
is a calm and moderate political style dealing with the problems 
of society and seeking professional solutions. We would like 
for Hungary, after the second round of elections on 29 May, to 
have a politically moderate and viable government. [end

  [Excerpts] A few minutes ago President Arpad Goncz gave a 
statement to Hungarian Television. Here is our recording of it. 
  [Begin Goncz recording] [passage omitted] I am very glad 
that 
the election has taken place so smoothly, I almost dare to say, 
in a cheerful manner. [passage omitted] I am very glad that the 
voters' participation in terms of the national average has been 
so high. This matches the best European standards. So the 
anxiety that Hungary has become apathetic and that Hungary has 
lost interest in its own fate has proved groundless. [passage 
omitted] 
  I will probably await the outcome of the next round of the 
elections with greater excitement. [passage omitted] If there 
is anything I can ask from the country and the parties, it is 
that after all this they should not turn sour the beauty and 
smoothness of this with a negative campaign or by mud-slinging 
or with anything else. I do not believe that the essence could 
be changed, it would only leave a bitter taste in our mouth, in 
the mouth of the Hungarian electorate -- and there is no need 
for that whatsoever. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] You will now hear Imre Szekeres, executive 
deputy chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. 
  [Begin recording] [Szekeres] [passage omitted] The high 
turnout and the fact that, practically speaking, nothing has 
disturbed the elections -- apart from minor irregularities -- 
mean that democracy is irreversible in Hungary and this is the 
most important thing. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What do you say regarding the 
anxiety, which was expressed before the elections already, that 
in case of an MSZP success, the country would be threatened by a 
kind of reversal? 
  [Szekeres] I think that such reversal is not threatening the 
country, no matter which party wins; nobody in this country 
wants a reversal, neither the electorate nor any democratic 
political party. No reversal whatsoever is threatening because 
the MSZP's political and expert program looks forward and seeks 
solutions to the country's tasks. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] It was also said prior to the elections that 
should an MSZP government be formed in Hungary, a change of 
personnel would take place in public administration. 
  [Szekeres] I think that such reports are groundless. Whoever 
should make up the next government -- the MSZP would also be a 
member -- he should be very careful that the public employees 
and the civil servants who carry out their work independent of 
political parties should not depend on a change of government. 
The practice that experts are changed every four years, after 
elections, should be changed. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Do you consider a certain kind of coalition 
with the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] necessary after the 
second round? 
  [Szekeres] In my view, according to our original stance, we 
will only decide about starting coalition negotiations after the 
second round of the elections. We want to wait for the results 
of the elections. It should come to light how many people 
support the MSZP's program and how many support other parties so 
negotiations for forming a government can be started afterward, 
that is if the president of the republic will ask the MSZP to do 
this. 
  Our stance is that we can cooperate with parties whose 
program is close to that of the MSZP. I consider the Alliance 
of Free Democrats such a party and also the Fidesz [Federation 
of Young Democrats]. [end recording]

  [Text] Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young 
Democrats [Fidesz], has announced that he is willing to give up 
his mandate as party chairman but will remain in his post if the 
Young Democrats' congress asks him to do so. Fidesz, which 
according to the most recent data is the last--sixth, with 
scarcely more than 7 percent of the votes--of the parties to get 
into parliament, will make a decision at a session of the 
presidium tomorrow about the convening and date of this 
extraordinary meeting. 
  Viktor Orban said that as long as he is chairman of Fidesz 
his party would certainly not enter into a coalition with the 
Hungarian Socialist Party, which received the most votes. 
According to Orban, the country has voted for a radical change; 
Fidesz, however, wanted only a partial turnabout, and this is 
probably why it performed more poorly than expected.

  [Text] Viktor Orban [chairman of the Federation of Young 
Democrats -- Fidesz] has been misunderstood; he does not want to 
resign. Katalin Horvath reports: 
  [Horvath] The country does not want what the Fidesz wants. 
Probably we could not explain well enough and could not convince 
people of the ideas of the Fidesz. This was the cause of our 
poor performance, said Fidesz Chairman Viktor Orban. 
  As a matter of fact, the Hungarian election result resembles 
a Polish scenario. It means that the government party could not 
cope with the economy and people cast their votes for the party 
which ruled before 1990. The Fidesz has been working for one 
and a half years to prevent this -- unfortunately, without 
success. 
  The Fidesz will continue to be in opposition. If necessary, 
in the second round, Fidesz candidates will step back in favor 
of the Alliance of Free Democrats. By doing so at least the 
Hungarian Socialist Party's advantage can be reduced even though 
it cannot be changed, Viktor Orban said. 
  Speaking about his chairmanship, he merely said that his 
statement of last night had been misunderstood. He is not even 
thinking of resigning. The party congress will decide on his 
chairmanship.

  [Excerpts] Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP], who was in a serious car accident on Thursday 
evening, is being treated in a hospital in Miskolc in northern 
Hungary. The party chairman had not yet gone to bed after 
midnight because of the election excitement, and our 
correspondent managed to interview him on the telephone. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Good evening, Mr. 
Chairman. 
  [Horn] Good evening. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] How satisfied are you with the election 
results? 
  [Horn] I am very satisfied. They are very good and exceed 
expectations; at least they exceed what I had seen and heard to 
date. So I am pleased that we did not work in vain. 
  [Correspondent] The political analysts are considering to 
what the success can be attributed. Two alternatives have 
emerged. The first is that with very calm, very restrained 
political activity, the party, which four years ago ended up in 
the depths, was able to get back to its feet. Do you agree? 
  [Horn] I naturally agree with that. However, those who are 
evaluating us should recognize that this meant very hard work 
for us. 
  [Correspondent] According to the other opinion, four years 
ago the people voted against something. Now, however, after 
they have experienced the feeling of freedom and independence, 
they are turning to social issues. 
  [Horn] That is not how I judge it. Of course, the question 
at hand also involves the significance of social issues, but 
economic policy is at least as important. So is the sorting out 
of relations with the neighboring countries, as is the European 
political culture which the Socialist Party has represented to 
date. Finally, let me add: We did not express hatred toward 
anyone, nor did we want to (?exclude) anyone. We also (?said) 
that no matter how sharp the differences of view were, it was 
necessary to seek the possibility of normal relations. 
  [Correspondent] We have spoken with a correspondent from 
French television's second channel, and he said that this 
sweeping victory, this confident victory, that the MSZP achieved 
would be convincing for the West as well. 
  [Horn] I had no doubts that the West had confidence in the 
Socialist Party. Indeed, allow me to add: More than one 
Western statesman, big financial experts, and entrepreneurs said 
that if the MSZP came to power two things would be certain. One 
was that it would form a government using people with expertise. 
The other was that its policy would be predictable. I believe 
that the West can be pleased with these election results. 
  [Correspondent] Very many people are saying now, mainly 
those 
who have been in government positions until now, that they hope 
the reforms that have been started will not come to a halt. 
  [Horn] They should have no doubts. It is completely certain 
that reform and transformation will continue. The essence here 
is that we must set ourselves to the task more cleverly in many 
areas. It is always necessary to consider that this country in 
many respects is taking the road not taken. Many things must be 
tried out. 
  But one thing must never be forgotten: It is not the people 
who are the guinea pigs. It is necessary to work in a manner so 
that the people live better and can secure a normal life for 
themselves and their children. I apologize for my voice, but it 
is still not 100 percent after the operation. 
  [Correspondent] A final question. We now can ask, very 
quietly, whether the chairman of the victorious party could gain 
the position of prime minister based on the results of the 
election. 
  [Horn] In the final analysis, the question of whether or not 
I will be prime minister will be decided by the MSZP. I have 
never been intimidated by the job, but I have never considered 
this to be the primary concern. The important thing, rather, is 
for this party to be able to realize a program covering 
economic, social, and all other areas, one which takes reality 
as its point of departure, one which is in harmony with the 
interests of society and the great majority of the people. 
  [Correspondent] Many thanks for the conversation and I wish 
you a speedy recovery. [end recording]

  [Text] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], which was 
victorious in the first round of the elections, maintains the 
right to decide who is to be prime minister, Zoltan Gal, head of 
the MSZP deputies in the previous parliament, has said. He 
added that the MSZP would not begin coalition talks before the 
second round. 
  MSZP Executive Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres said that every 
election alliance collapsed after the first round and that the 
liberal bloc accord did not endanger the efforts of the 
Socialists to find a coalition partner. 
  The same view was expressed by MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn, who 
is recovering in the hospital and who said his health was better 
now than during the past days. 
  Gabor Kuncze, member of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] and candidate for prime minister, said that the SZDSZ 
had a chance in the second round to halt the sweeping victory of 
the Socialists and to prevent the continuation of a covert one 
party system in Hungary. The SZDSZ's candidate for premier did 
not reply to the question of whether they were willing to form a 
coalition with the Socialists, but he immediately added that the 
MSZP would certainly be unable to form a government alone. 
Gabor Kuncze expressed the hope that the individual 
constituency candidates of the Federation of Young Democrats and 
the Agrarian Alliance would withdraw their candidacies in favor 
of the SZDSZ in the second round.

<F P=106> [Interview with Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian </F>
Justice and Life Party, by correspondent Peter Obersovszky; date 
and place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Obsersovszky] In light of the figures, can you 
imagine a demonstration like the one you spoke about shortly 
before the elections? You spoke about 100,000 people and that 
the pronation parties, political groupings, and people ought to 
demonstrate that they did not want a left-wing victory. 
  [Csurka] This is the third time I have been asked a question 
like this this evening, as if there were a secret service here 
wanting to know what I am planning, and whether I am taking the 
Hungarian people to the streets. That is not my intention. I 
know what we must do. We must organize anew the Hungarian Way 
and the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] on a 
professional basis. We have not had the money or financial 
resources for this so far. It will become clear now upon whom we 
can count. 
  Do not expect me to tell the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ], which has really come to power, what I plan. What I 
will say is that this victory is not the victory of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party, but the victory of the SZDSZ, because 
this government will be directed by the SZDSZ and it will 
function in accordance with the interests stipulated by the 
foreign supporters of the SZDSZ.

  [Text] As it was four years ago, Hungary will again have a 
parliament with six parties, and it will include the same 
parties as in 1990. However, their positions of power will be 
considerably different. 
  According to the unofficial final results of the first round 
in the parliamentary elections, the Hungarian Socialist Party is 
in first place with 32.4 percent of the votes; the Alliance of 
Free Democrats is second with 19.4 percent; the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum is in third place with 12 percent of the votes, 
followed by the Independent Smallholders Party with 8.5 percent. 
The Federation of Young Democrats ended up in fifth place with 
7.4 percent. The Christian Democratic People's Party obtained 
(?7.3) percent of the votes. 
  The other nine parties fielding national lists did not 
achieve the 5 percent necessary to enter parliament.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Gabor Kuncze, Alliance of Free </F>
Democrats nominee for prime minister, by correspondent Judit 
Laszlo; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Laszlo] Are you satisfied with the election 
results? 
  [Kuncze] The SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Demmocrats has done 
well 
in these elections. We received more than 1 million votes on 
the lists. In effect, this means that we repeated our 1990 
election results, that is we have achieved the aim we had set 
for ourselves. The SZDSZ is the only party which has a chance 
of preventing a landslide victory by the Hungarian Socialist 
Party and of preventing the continuance of a covert one-party 
system after the May elections. We have to wait for the results 
of the second round. [passage omitted] 
  [Laszlo] There is an agreement between the SZDSZ and the 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] that candidates who 
scored poorly are to step down in favor of the other party's 
candidate. Having seen the Fidesz results, do you think that is 
going to happen? Will the Fidesz candidates step down in favor 
of the SZDSZ? 
  [Kuncze] The Fidesz leaders have stated several times that 
they respect the agreement. The SZDSZ has also said this. 
Therefore, I am sure that this agreement will work. I also add 
that the same is true of the Agrarian Alliance and the Liberal 
Civic Alliance-Entrepreneurs' Party. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Laszlo Bekesi, the elaborator of the economic 
policy of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], does not believe 
very much in the government's economic success policy or the 
predictions of an imminent economic upswing. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Bekesi recording] We know precisely that a bitterly 
hard lesson awaits the next government; and this will be true 
even if on the basis of today's results there are perhaps better 
chances for the creation of a successful coalition and a 
successful government program than there were even a day ago. 
  There is a good chance that an efficient coalition will come 
into being. What is at least as important is that there is also 
a good chance that this coalition will have a good program. We 
can only hope -- and we wish this for all of us, for society 
above all -- that those who voted for us will stay with us even 
while we wrestle with the difficulties of implementing the 
program we have outlined. And we are also clear that after the 
elections, you, the overwhelming majority of the press, will 
automatically become an opposition press. I think I can promise 
on behalf of us all that we will not blame you for the bitter 
problems. [end recording] 
  In the event there is an overall victory, it will probably 
be 
Bekesi who will have to conclude the social contract which will 
expect entrepreneurs to moderate their profits and employees to 
exercise restraint in the wages battle. According to [MSZP] 
Deputy Chairman Ferenc Baja, the phase of change in the system 
in which the Hungarian left wing struggled for its life, has 
ended. 
  [Begin Baja recording] It is true that the second round will 
be the decisive one. Prime Minister Peter Boross was right in 
this. The position from which we are preparing for this second 
round is that in 152 individual constituencies we are starting 
out from the victorious first place. We will not commit the 
mistake, either, of regarding the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free 
Democrats] as an opponent in the next period just because it is 
in second place. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] One of the leaders of the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF] believes that her party can improve its election results 
if it forms a coalition with the other two conservative parties 
and they renounce their votes in favor of the MDF. Speaking on 
television's "Sunrise" [Napkelte] program, Krisztina Dobos said 
they are now beginning to hold talks about this with the 
Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]. [FKGP Chairman] Jozsef 
Torgyan does not consider such an agreement to be impossible. 
According to the Smallholder chairman, as a matter of fact, 
differences so far have been between the party leaderships not 
the membership. 
  Bela Csepe, outgoing leader of the Christian Democrats 
parliamentary group, said that if necessary the Christian 
Democrats will step back in favor of the MDF.

  [Excerpt] Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent 
Smallholders Party [FKGP], considers his party's role in the 
elections to have been successful. According to him, the 
Smallholders could become the most significant opposition force 
because, he said, after the Hungarian Democratic Forum's bad 
performance, there is still an internal explosion awaiting it. 
Torgyan also said that the Hungarian Socialist Party's success 
has to be accepted. 
  Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz] is of the view that in the past four years his party 
has traveled the path that it set itself in 1990. According to 
him, this was sufficient for it to achieve its election result.

  [Text] The Republic Party was one of the parties which have 
already commented on the election results. Katalin Horvath 
reports: 
  [Horvath] According to Republic Party Chairman Janos 
Palotas, 
people voted for parties rather than personalities. The 
sweeping victory of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] was due 
to this fact and it is the Hungarian Democratic Forum's 
government policy -- not the MSZP -- which is responsible for 
this. It is certain that these election results are not 
politically healthy, Janos Palotas said. This kind of victory 
is unprecedented even in the western democracies. But the MSZP 
won in democratic elections and the will of society should be 
respected. 
  As far as the economic policy programs of the MSZP and the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] are concerned, they are 
similar to the Republic Party's economic ideas in many points, 
although they can only be compared when the MSZP and the SZDSZ 
present their ideas on domestic market regulation, taxes, 
customs duties, and inflation. 
  Janos Palotas hopes that the MSZP's victory does not cause a 
political shock and does not make the economy collapse. As far 
as the Republic Party is concerned, in Janos Palotas's view the 
party is ready for parliamentary work and it can enter 
parliament in the next elections. The Republic Party is now 
preparing for the local government elections.

  [Excerpts] The chairman of the Agrarian Alliance admitted 
that in the first round the party performed worse than expected 
and he said that this is also true for all the small parties. 
Gyongyi V. Nagy reports: 
  [Nagy] Society is clear that it makes the decision: The 
worst 
ones go and the better ones come -- even if on this occasion we 
lost, said Tamas Nagy, chairman of the Agrarian Alliance. 
[passage omitted] 
  The citizens did not wish to tolerate the government's style 
any longer, so they voted for the Hungarian Socialist Party and 
Alliance of Free Democrats, two parties which gave the biggest 
guarantee for stopping the present practice of politics, the 
chairman said. [passage omitted] 
  At the news conference it was said that the Agrarian 
Alliance 
will try to weigh up whether the countryside, the peasantry, 
needs a separate political force.

  [Excerpt] The Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] is also 
assessing the chances of the second round of the election and 
hopes that in three weeks' time it will be able to overtake the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. Agnes Pap reports: 
  [Pap] The Smallholders are satisfied with the first round of 
the elections and are expecting the position of the parties in 
third and fourth place to change on 29 May, in other words that 
the FKGP will overtake the MDF and will be one of those to stand 
on the podium, [FKGP Chairman] Jozsef Torgyan said. 
  The party chairman stressed: They will in any event conduct 
politics in opposition. There can be no question of joining an 
eventual government made up of the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and such a 
government is possible, in his opinion. The FKGP does not want 
to conclude an all-embracing election alliance with any party 
for the second round, he said, recalling the bad experiences of 
the second round of the 1990 elections. 
  However, Jozsef Torgyan did not exclude the possibility of 
concluding one-off agreements with the parties on the national 
side, or that they might step back in favor of one another. 
  Mrs. G. Nagy, nee Agnes Maczo [FKGP deputy chairwoman], said 
she can imagine this at most in connection with the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP] because, she stressed, there is 
no reason to change the existing decisive opposition approach to 
politicizing with the MDF. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andras Kerekes] </F>
  [Excerpts] The outcome of 127 mandates has been decided in 
the first round of the elections. [passage omitted] In the 
first round 68.9 percent of the electorate voted. A news 
conference for the international press ended not long ago at the 
National Election Center, where they primarily wanted to inform 
the foreign journalists about the overall preliminary results. 
[passage omitted] 
  They have now also announced the distribution of seats on 
the 
regional party lists. According to this, the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] will receive another 53 seats, with 32.9 
percent of the votes; the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] has 
28 seats with 19.7 percent; the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] 
has 18 seats with 11.7 percent; the Independent Smallholders 
Party [FKGP] has 14 seats with not quite 9 percent of the votes; 
and the Christian Democrats [KDNP] -- although they gained a few 
votes more than Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] -- the 
latter received seven seats but the KDNP received only five. 
This is because of the different numbers of voters in the 
regions. 
  A total of 27 seats passed from the regional lists to the 
national lists [to be decided in the second round]. 
  Zoltan Toth, head of the national election office, said that 
of approximately 22,000 ballot papers they are unable to account 
for a total of 18, but they hope that by 1500 this afternoon, 
the time of the briefing in parliament, the premliminary results 
of the first round will be complete including these. [passage

  [Text] The leaders of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] 
are not blaming anyone for the fact that the party gave a weak 
perfomance in the first round of the elections. On the 
contrary, what they are focusing on is that in three weeks' time 
they should be able to get the majority of their remaining 
candidates into parliament. Edit Nagy reports: 
  [Nagy] The MDF wishes to head a national coalition of forces 
that could turn around the power relations which emerged after 
the first round of the elections, said Spokesman Karoly Herenyi, 
who added: That is why the MDF wishes, possibly, to conclude 
local agreements with the Christian Democratic People's Party 
[KDNP] and the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]. 
  Karoly Herenyi said that the forging ahead of the left wing 
is unstoppable in the east central European countries and that 
in our country this was not caused by the MDF's campaign or its 
four years of government. As a result of the unpopular measures 
which were taken, questions arose in people's minds which four 
years were not enough to answer. 
  It was said about the further tasks of the MDF that their 
aim 
is to get at least two-thirds of the remaining 100 candidates 
into parliament. They will work out the strategy for this in 
the coming days. Karoly Herenyi also drew attention to the fact 
that there was no debate during the evaluation of the first 
round at the [MDF] presidium session; they did not blame anyone 
for the results and they do not fear a party split, either.

  [Text] A Public Order Ministry report confirms that 
yesterday afternoon 150 to 200 residents from the villages 
flooded by Fierze lake began a hunger strike and occupied the 
committee building of Kukes city. Their demands consisted of an 
annual rent for the flooded land, compensation for the flooded 
houses and other buildings, an organized transfer to other 
areas, and long-term loans. As seen, some of these demands 
cannot be met and are unreasonable. The democratic government 
considered some other demands to be reasonable and promised to 
put them into effect. 
  For this reason, four ministers of the democratic government 
held a meeting with the strike commission yesterday. After 
lengthy discussions on these problems, they asked the commission 
to liberate the occupied building. 
  After this meeting, several strikers abandoned the strike. 
More than half of them categorically refused to leave and 
attacked the public order forces, as they attempted to evict 
them according to the law. Consequently, 26 persons were 
wounded with stones and other hard objects -- of whom 14 were 
from the Public Order forces -- with two suffering fractures. 
  The Public Order Ministry stresses that certain extremist 
elements stand behind these offenders, who are former Labor 
Party leaders and collaborators of the secret police and who, 
besides this, have today committed the grave crime of blocking 
the national road. The Public Order Ministry stresses that 
measures according to the law will be initiated against the 
persons responsible.

  [Text] President of the Republic Sali Berisha received 
Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi and Ministers Xhaja, Musaraj, 
Manushi, and Halili in a long meeting. They informed the 
president about the problems created by the strike as well as 
the demands of the strikers, who represent families evicted as a 
result of the construction of dams and hydropower stations. 
  At the meeting Prime Minister Meksi stressed that the 
government has been and still is seriously engaged in treating 
all the problems of evicted families as well as their reasonable 
demands, despite the fact that in these demands there are some 
things that are financially absurd and cannot be afforded. 
Concerning these reasons, he is going to meet the 
representatives of the evicted families on Sunday. 
  The ministers, who have established contacts with 
representatives of the strikers, also said that the strikers' 
claims constitute serious and fair demands in themselves. 
Minister Halili noted that upon the government's order, the 
Agriculture Ministry has compiled and continues to compile lists 
of all evicted families and, according to its decision, will 
present it to the government for examination by the end of May 
to enable the government to take concrete measures to resolve 
the problems of these families. 
  President Berisha said that he has studied the petition and 
the demands of the evicted families, understands them quite 
well, and is sensitive to the created problems and the 
difficulties they have faced as a result of the eviction from 
their land and houses. 
  Concerning yesterday's events in Kukes, he pointed out that 
we have to deal with two realities: First, we have to deal with 
several fair demands and serious difficulties of the evicted 
families. Thus, in case there exists any absurd and 
unreasonable demand, this does not mean that this factor should 
darken, though little, the solution of the other fair demands. 
  Second, if two, five, or 10 elements of Enverist convictions 
or evil aims managed to get among the strikers and disorient 
them, the other reality represented by several separate 
extremist elements should in no way lessen the urgent interest 
of the government to treat the fair demands of the evicted 
families with priority, because these manipulators who undertake 
to usurp state buildings and block national roads have nothing 
in common with the troubles and sorrows of the evicted 
population. 
  The government should have shown and must show itself to be 
more active in resolving their problems. It is necessary to 
complete the registration of these families, to identify who has 
received land according to the law and the ones who are left 
with no land, who are employed and who are not, who have 
received homes and who have not, and to start a program quickly 
to solve the problems of these evicted families and compensate 
them according to possibilities. 
  I am convinced that after seeing that the government is 
concretely solving their problems, they will themselves 
understand that several demands are unacceptable and will 
abandon them. That is why the government and the parliament 
should consider the problems of the evicted with priority and in 
their complexity, President Berisha stated.

<F P=106> [Altin Malaj report: "Tense Situation in Kukes"] </F>
  [Text] 
<H5>  Why Is There Tension? </H5>
  The first days of May were very tense in Kukes. A possible 
hunger strike had been announced some days previously as a 
consequence of the intolerable misery that is a result of the 
neglect of the demands of the inhabitants of 45 villages along 
the banks of the Drin. People's feelings brought them out on 
the streets. Gatherings increased on 1, 2, and 3 May. Warning 
strikes also began, while the government in Tirana remained 
silent at demands that were beyond the competence of local 
authorities. The strikers then decided to embark on that most 
appalling human act, a hunger strike. Perhaps this is the only 
way to make our governments come out to the people. This is 
indeed what happened. It took a group of 50 strikers occupying 
the meeting hall of the former Kukes District Executive 
Committee on the morning of 4 May for four ministers of the 
Democratic government to urgently descend on Kukes by 
helicopter. These included Public Order Minister Agron Musaraj. 
Ministers Manushi, Halili, and Xhaja flew with him. 
<H5>  Why Did the Strike Begin? </H5>
  When the great dam of the Fierze hydroelectric station was 
built years ago, it did not occur to anybody that this project 
could later become the cause of major social problems that would 
lead people to consciously make sacrifices of themselves. The 
then regime made an extraordinary commotion about creating new 
socialist villages, about which even songs were composed. These 
are now turning into scenes of tragedy. About 30,000 
inhabitants of the inundated villages were rehoused in 13 
specially constructed so-called "socialist villages." At that 
time, these people who were uprooted from their land were 
content merely with a house each, which the state built for 
them. They made no great claims over their expropriation, 
because other cooperativist peasants were in virtually the same 
position. However, the start of the democratic movement, the 
collapse of the cooperatives, and the restoration of property 
left these inhabitants of inundated villages stranded like fish 
out of water. They could not return to their old land, because 
this was under the waters of the "lake of light." Moreover, the 
inhabitants of the villages where they had settled began to 
evict them, because of their own land ownership. This was when 
they started to raise their demands, which boiled down to a 
matter of life and death. They democratically created their 
association of those expropriated by flooding, which was 
recognized by law. In 1991, they also formulated their demands, 
which they submitted to the government. Here they are: 
  -- about 2,000 hectares in compensation for the inundated 
land. 
  -- rent for their land on the basis of the approximate value 
of the produce of the inundated land. 
  -- recognition of co-ownership in any possible privatization 
of the hydroelectric station. 
  -- compensation for the difference in house values then and 
now. 
  -- the accommodation of emigrant families in areas with 
adequate land. 
  But what concretely has been done with these demands between 
1991 and now? Nothing, except that they have been recognized as 
fair, both then and now. In September 1993, representatives of 
the association meet with Arbnori and Selami, and as a result a 
government commission was created under Hasan Halili, now 
agriculture minister. This commission has apparently never met. 
The protests of the people of Kukes continued with a petition 
addressed to the president of the Republic, but all these 
efforts fell on the government's deaf ears. Under such 
circumstances, the association decided to use the final method 
of a hunger strike. 
<H5>  Dialogue Followed by the Use of Force </H5>
  The government was faced with an accomplished fact: In the 
hall of the building in Kukes, the initial number of strikers 
had trebled. They threatened not to leave the hall alive unless 
their demands were met. Around the building, hundreds of other 
people expressed solidarity with those inside. The tension 
continually increased. The ministers came from Tirana. They 
started talks with the strike committee, the committee of the 
association, and the district council. All the district's 
political groups called the strikers' demands fair, as did the 
ministers, who attempted to extinguish the conflict with 
discussions and promises. They offered hope for the migration 
of some families, which had been approved by the relevant 
communes. However, the strikers insisted on all their demands 
and requested an urgent meeting with Prime Minister Meksi. Thus 
the dialogue became embittered, and the members of the 
government, who had not forgotten to bring with them some 
vehicles with special forces, decided to use coercion, and 
declared the strike to be illegal. Clashes began between 
citizens and the special police forces. Forces of the Kukes 
police were not used. There was no way in which they could 
strike at their parents, brothers, and sisters. There were 
inevitably gunshots and blows with truncheons and stones. A 
truly painful situation. The result? Exact information is not 
available, but official reports speak of 26 wounded, including 
14 policemen and 12 demonstrators. 
  The tension in Kukes, which has lasted five days, is 
continuing. The prime minister has still not gone there. The 
national highway by the bridge of the Drin i Zi linking Kukes 
with the rest of Albania was blockaded for one day, another 
harsh warning from the strikers' supporters. The number of 
people surrounding the building where the strikers are holed up 
sometimes rises, sometimes falls. It is said that Jah Trota, 
chairman of the strike committee from the village of Kenete, has 
spoken to Mr. Meksi on the telephone, but they wait for him in 
Kukes. Perhaps this would defuse the tension of recent days.

  [Text] Solidarity's protest action is continuing. At 0900, 
Solidarity employees at the Czestochowa Steelworks 
[central-southern Poland] staged a two-hour strike. The 
Solidarity regional board did not receive notification of strike 
participation by other factories in Czestochowa Province. 
  In the central-eastern region of Poland, the work-force of 
the Communications Equipment Plant in Swidnik, the scales 
factory in Lublin, and the rolling bearings factory in Krasnik 
joined the strike today.

<F P=106> [Report by Pawel Reszka, Piotr Adamowicz, and Barbara </F>
Cieszewska: "A Few Hundred Enterprises Will Stop Work, 
Krzaklewski Says; `Solidarity' Without Impetus"] 
  [Text] Most of the members of the National Commission of 
the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity" ["S"] 
believe that the union should withdraw from the Trilateral 
Commission. According to them, work in the commission cannot be 
a substitute for bilateral talks with the government. After the 
lignite miners suspended their strike, the protest of "S" lost 
its impetus; however, Marian Krzaklewski has announced tbe 
escalation of strikes for today. Anthracite mines are still on 
strike; the protest has been joined by the railroad workers, 
even though the General Directorate of the Polish State 
Railroads [PKP] claims that only 14 employees went on strike -- 
in Tarnowskie Gory. 
  Apart from this, in line with the data of "S," 20 
enterprises 
all over Poland are taking part in a continuous strike. The 
unionists are hoping that the deadlock may be broken if the 
protest is joined by more railroad workers and if the lignite 
miners resume their strike. 
<H5>  Presidium Against the Commission </H5>
  "Most of the members of the Presidium of the National 
Committee believe that the union should no longer participate in 
the Trilateral Commission because it does not fulfill the 
functions for which it has been set up," "S" spokesman Piotr Zak 
told RZECZPOSPOLITA. Minister Miller is trying to make people 
believe that the Trilateral Commission is a wonderful remedy for 
all conflicts and that it is the committee that should handle 
the union's demands. He forgets, however, that "S" is the only 
union that signed an agreement with the government (on 29 May 
1992), whereby it may begin collective bargaining with the 
government, and resolution of the strike is possible through 
negotiations between the union and the government. Therefore, 
the Presidium believes that the work of the Trilateral 
Commission cannot substitute for bilateral negotiations. 
According to the "S" spokesman, the present commission, 
"without a legal foundation and in view of the fact that the 
issue of the representativeness of the unions has not been 
settled," is a fictitious body. 
<H5>  Krzaklewski: Culmination Today </H5>
  "S" National Commission Chairman Marian Krzaklewski said 
that 
the government's statement that popiwek [tax on excessive wage 
increases] will have been rescinded by the end of the year is 
contrary to the agreement signed with lignite miners (following 
which they suspended their strike). 
  "In such a situation the union is preparing a strike action 
in the power industry; on Friday the Strike Committee in the 
Belchatow mine will decide whether or not to resume the strike 
in this enterprise," he said. He added that the "S" Protest 
Action Headquarters will agree that the mine renew its strike. 
  "On Friday there will be a culmination of our three-day 
strike. A few hundred enterprises will stop work, among others, 
the historical Gdansk Shipyard," announced the "S" leader. 
  It is worth recalling that the "S" Strike Headquarters 
first announced a nationwide continuous strike action and then 
declared that it would be intensified on 4, 5, 6, and 7 May; all 
the branches of the union were supposed to take part in an 
active strike. 
  According to Krzaklewski, through the present strikes the 
union has achieved its strategic goals; now there must be 
"collective pressure, so that the demands are reinforced." 
Asked about the scale of the strike, he stated that this was 
just the scale that he had expected and that there were no 
surprises: "I knew how many enterprises would stop work." Also 
the union's spokesman positively evaluated the course of the 
strike; he added, however, that he was not familiar with the 
data that PKP had at its disposal. Miners go or not go on 
strike. 
  Today a demonstration by the defense industry unionists is 
to 
be held in Warsaw, as well as a "S" demonstration in Biala 
Podlaska. An eight-hour strike will be staged in the enterprises 
of the Gdansk region, including the shipyards and ports of 
Gdansk and Gdynia. The fuel base in the northern port will be 
cut off, which will make the reloading and reception of oil 
impossible. 
  Yesterday the strike by anthracite miners was joined by two 
mines: "Zabrze-Bielszowice" and "Nowy Wirek." "S" claims that 
23 coal mines and three zinc and lead mines are out on strike. 
The State Anthracite Agency maintains that 20 anthracite mines 
are out on strike. 
  "S" did not manage to organize a strike in the Gliwice Coal 
Partnership yesterday. If the "S" plant committees of the mines 
that are associated with it do not join the strike, the "S" 
Inter-Mine Coordination Commission in the Gliwice partnership 
threatened to request the region's leadership to suspend the 
present authorities of the union in the individual mines. 
<H5>  The Union Is Not the Army </H5>
  Off the record, the unionists concede that the strike was 
not 
as successful as was expected -- even though Marian Krzaklewski 
holds a different opinion. They point out that the protest lost 
momentum when the lignite mines suspended their strike. Some 
criticize the behavior of Strike Headquarters, whose decision 
concerning the intensification of the strikes was so sudden that 
there was not enough time to inform the Plant Committees about 
it and to persuade them to strike. 
  "There is discipline in the union; however, it is not a 
military-like discipline," we were told by a high-ranking "S" 
activist. Quite common is the opinion that "S" strikes are 
better organized by the various branches, which can add their 
own demands and thus encourage employees to go on strike. The 
unionists are now hoping that the protest will be joined by the 
railroad workers and that the employees of the power industry 
will resume their strike, which might result in extending the 
strike action.

  [Excerpts] The Solidarity Mining and Power Industry 
Secretariat has decided during its meeting in Katowice to ask 
the government for immediate and direct talks with the union. 
Otherwise the union plans to intensify the protest action and 
restart the strike in brown coal mines. 
  Strike committees of the hard and brown coal mining 
industries and power and heating industries took part in today's 
meeting of the Mining and Power Industry Secretariat in 
Katowice. Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski also took part 
in this meeting. After the failed culmination of the strike 
last Friday [6 May], which was announced by Krzaklewski, the 
trade unionists were discussing how the Solidarity protests 
would be organized in the next few days. 
  Solidarity is not withdrawing its general demands but is now 
willing to agree to talk about the power industry demands on the 
condition that these would be two-way talks between Solidarity 
and the government. [passage omitted] 
  It is possible that a meeting between Marian Krzaklewski and 
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak or President Lech Walesa may 
still take place tonight after the premiere of the Kazimierz 
Kutz film in Katowice.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Lithuanian </F>
reporters in Warsaw; date not given: "If We Think About the 
Past, the Future Will Run Away"] 
  [Excerpts] We have reported that on the eve of his 
visit to Vilnius, Lech Walesa, president of the Republic of 
Poland, received a group of Lithuanian journalists and answered 
their questions. The conversation took place around the marble 
table in the Belveder. The Polish president replied to questions 
from journalists Aleksandra Akinczo (ZNAD WILII), Rytis Sabas 
(LIETUVOS RYTAS), Mecislovas Sadovskis (EKHO LITVY), Algirdas 
Strumskis (TIESA), Josef Szostakowski (KURIER WILENSKI), 
Kazimieras Sliuzas (ELTA), Rimantas Varnauskas (LIETUVOS AIDAS), 
and Algimantas Zukas (RESPUBLIKA). [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] There are enemies of the Polish-Lithuanian treaty 
on both sides. One representative of the Lithuanian Union of 
Poles compared this treaty to the Molotov-Ribbetrop pact. Mr. 
President, what can you say about this? What gains will this 
treaty bring to the Polish minority in Lithuania? 
  [Walesa] There has been much discussion, which means that 
the 
treaty is good. If the number of its supporter equals that of 
its enemies, the treaty is ideal. Let us take advantage of the 
possibilities that this treaty will present. 
  When we speak about ethnic minorities in Europe, we cannot 
invent new standards. The past is weighing heavily on the 
treaty's enemies, as well as on those who represent the ethnic 
minority. They are still avoiding a different assessment. This 
is a peculiar quadrangle of a circle. Until the treaty is 
signed, we will not be able to settle other matters. Thus, let 
us get moving at last. Let us follow the standards established 
in Europe: Primarily, the openness of our countries that will 
help to open borders and remove obstacles feared by the 
minorities. If there is no openness, our relations concerning 
ethnic minorities may deteriorate. I do not know who wants the 
two nations -- the Lithuanians and the Poles -- to not reach a 
mutual agreement. We are even becoming ridiculous because of 
that. We are such close nations, and we are settling these most 
important matters with such delay. I do not think that any side 
would resort to discrimination. The latter leads to Yugoslavia. 
Neither party wants a Yugoslavia. Thus, let us be open and get 
down to work. Certainly, Lithuania can choose the Asian 
direction, or that through Poland. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, we would like to hear from you 
what 
definite effect this treaty will have on economic, cultural, and 
political relations between Lithuania and Poland, which you and 
President A. Brazauskas will sign in Vilnius? 
  [Walesa] In former times, everything was imposed from above. 
You know that epoch. The one that is beginning now will be 
different: Political agreements only open possibilities and 
remove barriers to security. Life and people must make these 
political agreements effective, so that one could remove 
obstacles and overcome difficulties. We are trying to open our 
doors. Maybe, we are doing this incorrectly. Maybe, this 
should be done differently. However, we must accomplish the same 
what we did with other countries. The implementation of 
treaties by workers of culture, economists, and historians is a 
totally different issue. In short, a treaty means the opening 
of doors. Maybe, there will be some doors, but no one will walk 
through them. However, we, politicians, must open them. If it 
becomes obvious that we did too little, and that the minorities 
gain little from this treaty, we will change it. Demand will 
decide everything. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, excuse us for asking this 
question, 
which may be unpleasant to you. You say that you care about 
ethnic minorities. The Lithuanians in Poland stress their 
loyalty to this state. However, they are displeased to hear 
that, for example, this state lacks money to publish several 
thousand Lithuanian textbooks. Another example is that the 
Polish state imposes additional duties on building materials 
imported from Lithuania which are necessary for the construction 
of the Lithuanian cultural center. 
  [Walesa] One could assess the aforementioned duties and 
other 
things as malevolent issues. Some people claim this. However, 
this is untrue. Certainly, some things are not planned, in this 
case, this Lithuanian cultural house which is being built by 
Lithuanians. This was not included in our plans. However, this 
is done with no evil purpose. I did not learn to be a president 
as well. The freedom team that came to work may have not 
noticed those problems, while some newspapers assessed these as 
malevolent activities. Both you and us have some matters that 
are simply arranged improperly. Should we adopt a new 
constitution and customs clauses with regard to Lithuania? 
Maybe, our dear neighbor would not feel any damage in that 
case, and you would not question me about it. Maybe, these 
things should be changed, but there are principles. However, I 
am pleading for one thing -- do not pass over to the enemy's 
ranks. Let us assess this as a misunderstanding. I believe, 
however, that the problem is quite different. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, you said at the first 
"Solidarity" congress, I suppose, 13 years ago that you must 
drive the horses you were given. We know that your current 
position is not very easy. Could you tell us how your relations 
with the Sejm and the government are developing? 
  [Walesa] The problem does exist, but it lies elsewhere. 
Speaking about the complexity of the situation, I predicted that 
in advance. If we assess the situation in terms of my extreme 
desire for power, then my position is really difficult. 
However, I have never wanted to be president, and I have no 
desire to be one. I only wanted to fulfill a certain task. I 
wanted to overcome the former system that was bad to everyone. 
I wanted democracy, openness, and pluralism for everyone. When 
I was heard, the nation would go with me, and I would claim 
victory. My goal was to bring the country to the system we had 
planned. 
  Certainly, now we have different concepts and various 
troubles. At one moment, there was such an opinion that the 
Polish president must not have any political backing, and that 
he must be equal with other people. I also thought so and did 
everything to renounce any political impediments. Therefore, I 
am having trouble today. Different interests are being 
manipulated. These are not only the people from the old system. 
They are not necessarily bad communists. Every one of them -- 
leftists, rightists, and centrists -- would like me to be with 
them. I console everyone and urge him or her to preserve the 
balance. That is why I do not please everyone. However, I am 
implementing this concept with consistency. 
  People do not voice claims that I have no good initiatives. 
However, they are displeased with the fact that I do not 
implement those initiatives. They say that I have promised a 
few things but failed to fulfill them. Of course, I 
accomplished a lot. However, execution exceeds the limits of my 
possibilities. It is the government and the parliament which 
primarily engage in implementation. I am an executor in this 
political system. However, people care little about this. They 
say: We have elected you -- now you must deliver. My troubles 
have emerged due to the pressure from the system in which I 
happened to live. 
  The vital question is as follows: There must be one powerful 
leader, a political party, and a presidential or a parliamentary 
system. As long as this question remains unanswered, I am the 
sole person loyal to my principles, and this does not cause any 
trouble. 
  Certainly, I do not explain this, because primarily I am 
faithful to the principles which I promised to implement: To 
create a system and bring it into the country. Of course, one 
can make everyone listen to and follow the leader. One can also 
blind people through other measures: To incite and provoke 
them, or set them against each other. However, one must begin 
to create.... 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, recently, the presidents of the 
three Baltic states put forward the initiative called 
5 + 3 + 4 (Central European, the Baltic, and Visegrad group 
states). However, the Visegrad countries rejected this 
initiative. Why? 
  [Walesa] We still seem to misunderstand each other. One used 
to say in former times -- let us unite into pacts of three, 
five, and ten. One could really expect success then. The new 
epoch is quite different -- if we open our borders, we must have 
regional cooperation, and not because Vilnius is closer than 
Washington. Life's demands rather than decrees are responsible 
for such regional cooperation. 
  A similar problem arose during my conversation with Russian 
President B. Yeltsin. The Russians wanted to leave their 
factories at the former bases. I said: Mr. President, let us 
change this in the agreement so as to make our current economic 
cooperation tenfold larger. However, this depends on economic 
demand and cannot be imposed. I cannot impose cooperation on 
anyone if it is unprofitable. Do you, the Russians, want to 
mine gravel near Szczecin and ship it across Poland? Does not 
Russia have gravel? Therefore, I say, let us not do such things. 
  I believe that we must agree on the principles and values 
that we would defend. We must say that the entire world will 
defend Lithuania's freedom, as well as that of Poland. The most 
important thing is that no one will attack, if we sign such an 
agreement, if we remove all dangers, and if we say that the 
nuclear power station is the matter of the entire world, or at 
least of Europe, and not only the internal problem of Lithuania 
or Poland. However, all of Europe has the right to check 
whether the nuclear reactor is good or bad. If it is bad, 
Europe has the right to demand its closure. 
  Let us defend great principles and values. If such rights 
were observed in advance, there would be no problem of 
Yugoslavia, because it is said that everyone has the right to 
freedom. However, one's freedom must not pose any danger to the 
freedom of another person. This means that there are no 
possibilities for resolving problems by force. If someone does 
not observe these principles, he or she can be forced to do so. 
  In this respect, there is no need to create what you are 
talking about. There is no need to conclude agreements, if 
there is no demand. If the economy requires them, let us allay 
these matters, so as to be able to resolve them in a natural 
manner. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, you have said that you want to 
continue your duties. We understand that you will take part in 
the upcoming elections. 
  [Walesa] I still have two years. I see that the system for 
which I fought has not yet been created. If I really want to 
participate in the upcoming elections, I will really win them, 
because I always achieve what I want. 
  [Reporter] The veto of the popiwek [tax on excessive wage 
increases] law and the refusal to confirm the finance minister 
are assessed as your new election program. What would be the 
key principles of your election campaign? Who would be your 
most powerful rival? 
  [Walesa] I have enough time for the program. I have said 
that I want to create a system. By designing it, I show its 
faults and accomplishments. However, I set a challenge at the 
same time. We have the provisional Small Constitution. What 
can be the decision, if I say "no," and the government is unable 
to do anything. However, the government coalition says something 
different: We present you a name, and you (president) must 
approve it. Why? Under what law? 
  That is why it is bad for both sides (president and the 
coalition). I do not want these principles to be transferred to 
the new constitution, which we are now drafting. Can I ignore 
the problem of constitutional amendments resolved in such an 
improper manner? I ask who has the right to change the 
Constitution and the system? There can emerge a casual majority 
coalition in a couple of hours, even of drunk people, that can 
change the system. Seeing all this, I am setting a 
challenge.... [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Announcer] The government, at a closed meeting with 
the participation of the head of the armed forces, President 
Lech Walesa, adopted a document on Poland's defense policy. The 
minister of national defense will present it to the Sejm before 
the end of the month. 
  [Correspondent] In the document, two options are presented 
for the division of competences between a civilian minister of 
national defense and the commanders of the Army. Under the 
first, the chief commander of the Army--the post has not yet 
been given a name--is subordinate in military matters to the 
head of the armed forces, i.e., the president. The civilian 
minister of national defense will only exert 
administrative-political control. 
  [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] This option will, I believe, 
require legalization of this post, constitutional legalization 
of this post, and making the commander in chief constitutionally 
responsible for matters like battle readiness, mobilization, 
drawing up operational plans, and standard of military training. 
At the moment, the minister of national defense bears this 
responsibility. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] The second option aims at the president 
exerting command through a civilian minister, who works out the 
tasks for the armed forces and supervises their execution, but 
without interference in matters of command.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Grzegorz Kolodko, Polish finance </F>
minister and deputy prime minister, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at 
the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" 
program--live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is 
Professor Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and finance 
minister. Good morning to you, Sir. 
  [Kolodko] Good morning to you, and to you, Ladies and 
Gentlemen. 
  [Woyciechowski] When one reads newspaper headlines from the 
past few days, they resemble war reports: Battle for Popiwek 
[tax on excessive wage increases]--that is the kind of title 
that keeps appearing every day. What is this battle for popiwek 
all about, and who is fighting whom? 
  [Kolodko] I hope this will be the last battle because 
popiwek is a palliative situation; it is not a good solution. 
As everyone knows, it was introduced quite some time ago with 
the goal of regulating the rate of salary increases. We have 
been using it as an instrument of anti-inflationary policies, 
and it seems that it is the working people or the trade unions 
that are fighting the government, or, to put it in broader 
terms, the authorities in general--after all, popiwek is [words 
indistinct]... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Actually, the fight is with 
the finance minister--that is, you--because it is you who 
ultimately decides the issue. 
  [Kolodko] I would not like to think that this fight is with 
me. No, it is not the finance minister who decides, even though 
he naturally enjoys specific powers, he suggests certain 
solutions, there is the whole legislative process... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But what about you, 
personally? Are you in favor of the popiwek? 
  [Kolodko] I am not in favor of the popiwek, and I have just 
told you about some steps concerning what should be done to 
resolve this palliative situation that is not the optimal 
solution. And we are indeed resolving it. Now, I understand 
that the popiwek has been applied for so long because, even 
though it was not the best solution, it still kept nominal 
salaries in check and, by controlling salary inflation, the 
popiwek unquestionably contributed to decreasing price inflation. 
  [Woyciechowski] But how does the popiwek fit into a free 
market economy? Is there any country in the world, a capitalist 
country such as Poland, that has introduced this instrument? 
  [Kolodko] The popiwek does not fit into the free market 
economy very well because it obviously limits the sovereignty of 
economic units and enterprises, whereas we are eager for them to 
really conduct their own economic policies. Let me put it this 
way: I am referring first of all to operational activities and 
decisions regarding the distribution of economic surpluses into 
that part that is being invested and that part that is devoted 
to salaries--that has to be an independent process, whereas the 
popiwek is about the state's interference in decisions about 
distribution in an enterprise, and the popiwek's evil is about 
breaking apart a fundamental relationship in economic processes 
between awarding efficient labor... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is the popiwek a necessary 
evil? Is that your assessment? 
  [Kolodko, hesitating] It used to be a necessary evil, and 
right now it is also a necessary evil, but currently, we, the 
governing coalition, are suggesting--the Sejm already approved 
of that and the Senate will debate it today--namely to apply 
what I call the mechanism of the setting sun, meaning that we 
should impose on ourselves the rigor--I mean, not so much we 
ourselves as parliament will impose it on us as the 
government--that we should abandon the popiwek irreversibly, 
definitely, and, I hope, forever, and that should happen by the 
end of this year. This is really a very short period of time... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] By the end of this year? 
  [Kolodko] Exactly. So that means eight months in which a 
whole range of other systemwide solutions must be prepared that 
will facilitate labor efficiency and award increases in labor 
efficiency, but that--God forbid--will not result in an increase 
of inflationary pressures, which are very strong in Poland to 
begin with. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, how did your first week 
on the job go? You have been a deputy prime minister for one 
week now. 
  [Kolodko] It passed under conditions of a great deal of work 
and enormous pressures, on the part of not only the striking 
miners but also the mass media and people I met in the hallways 
of the Office of the Council of Ministers building. First of 
all, I spent the week trying to overcome an organizational 
jungle because a certain confusion occurred as a result of the 
vacancy at the post of deputy prime minister and finance 
minister for almost three months... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What happened when, after 
three months, you entered the empty office of the deputy prime 
minister and finance minister? Was there a huge pile of papers 
to be signed, or was it not like that at all? 
  [Kolodko] No, as far as that is concerned, everything had 
been very well prepared. What did happen, however, was that 
there were lying--or actually hanging in midair, I should 
say--some unresolved issues and problems, and I think the 
infamous popiwek and the highly complicated sociopolitical 
situation, I mean the wave of strikes I hope are on the decline 
now, this is what I encountered there. Some issues are being 
resolved and some need to be resolved soon, and the government 
is working on that. Some proposals will be presented soon, but 
the whole point about conducting economic policies is about 
finding the right way or method to resolve problems faster than 
new problems arise. One must have a colossal imagination and 
colossal psychological discipline, and, of course, one must have 
the appropriate economic knowledge. As far as the knowledge 
part is concerned, I studied and analyzed these issues for quite 
some time, so I am positive about that aspect. But actions need 
to be intensified by all means, and, from that standpoint, I can 
understand the impatience of trade unionists, of working people 
and businessmen who have unambiguous expectations vis-a-vis the 
government for it to fulfill some earlier declarations, 
especially those made during the election campaign, as far as 
the coalition parties are concerned. I did not take part in the 
campaign, but right now it is also my problem to keep the 
commitments. 
  [Woyciechowski] Let us go back for a moment to the first 
week. During your first week in the post of deputy prime 
minister, you must have read a great many secret documents, 
figures, and statistics. After this first week, do you view 
Poland's economic situation better or worse than a week ago? Is 
it very bad, very good, or just average? 
  [Kolodko] I have not read very many such secret figures. As 
deputy prime minister, I receive certain material labeled secret 
and confidential, and sometimes I wonder what makes something 
secret as opposed to confidential. My knowledge about the 
country's economy is comprehensive enough to be able to avoid 
some secret knowledge of which we would still not be aware... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So that means you were not 
surprised by anything over the week? 
  [Kolodko] No, from that perspective, I was not surprised by 
anything. 
  [Woyciechowski] But is it your assessment today that the 
situation is better or worse than what you thought a week ago? 
  [Kolodko] As far as the situation of the Polish economy 
goes, and also future prospects ahead of the economy, I say that 
the week introduced no major changes [words indistinct]... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So what is the economic 
situation like? 
  [Kolodko] I still think that, first of all, future prospects 
are good, even though today I have more problems on my mind 
because if it were not for the strikes, protests, and this 
horribly arranged social dialogue--I mean the strikes--my 
optimism would definitely be even greater to some extent, but I 
still approach this in a very constructive way, and I think we 
have good chances for resolving a whole range of economic 
problems to everybody's advantage. It so happens that the 
Polish economy has already entered a growth period, and I regard 
it as my main mission to conduct the kinds of policies that will 
strengthen the growth trend or even accelerate growth. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, on the one hand, there 
is growth, but, on the other, when you compare Poland with the 
Czech Republic, for instance, or with Hungary, we have a much 
higher inflation level and huge unemployment. Are these the two 
biggest obstacles--I mean inflation and unemployment? 
  [Kolodko] There is no doubt that they are both limitations 
to economic policies, but they are also those parts where our 
economic policies should be concentrated... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What must be done to halt the 
growth of inflation and to bring inflation to a normal level? 
Do you have an ideas on that? 
  [Kolodko] Yes, I do. Of course I have ideas. But this 
process is...[Kolodko pauses] You touched upon two issues here: 
inflation and unemployment. There is no doubt that, especially 
over the short run, there is a relationship between... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is inflation caused by 
unemployment, or is it the other way around? 
  [Kolodko] I mean, reducing inflation by subsequent 
percentage points under the current conditions--if it is not 
done with a certain monetary-fiscal sophistication, I would put 
it this way--may cause a further increase in unemployment. The 
goal of economic policies... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word, the lower the 
inflation, the higher the unemployment? 
  [Kolodko] Yes, I mean, if we tried to reduce inflation 
currently by applying instruments similar to those that were 
applied at the beginning if 1990, there is no doubt that this 
would result in a further increase in unemployment while one of 
the goals of socioeconomic policies of this particular 
government--and rightly so, in my view--is first of all to keep 
reducing the rate of unemployment growth--and we are practically 
at that stage now--followed by reductions in the rate of 
unemployment as such. 
  [Woyciechowski] How does inflation in Poland come about? 
What is its source? Is there any one source of inflation in 
Poland? 
  [Kolodko] Oh, no. There is no single source. Inflation is 
very complex, and it is partially of a structural nature, and 
partially it.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What do you mean by structural 
nature? 
  [Kolodko] I mean that the structure of our economy continues 
to be such, that, given the current systemwide 
solutions--unfortunately, this brings in the popiwek again--the 
flow of income is rising at a slightly faster rate than the flow 
of real supply--that is, production--so this causes [words 
indistinct].... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is this because someone awards 
raises to somebody? 
  [Kolodko] That is true, and also because, in macroeconomic 
terms, we pay out--that is, we introduce more money into the 
economy, through various channels, not only through salaries, 
than would be justified by a physical growth of the product. 
  [Woyciechowski] To make a long story short, we earn too 
much, Mr. Prime Minister? 
  [Kolodko] Oh, no, we do not earn too much. Right now our 
real wages are increasing because work efficiency and output are 
also increasing. Therefore, it would seem that it should be 
easier for us to conduct economic policy. Today's disputes are 
not over how to distribute the decreasing production and how to 
share the ever-growing amount of poverty, but over how to share 
this richness, which is increasing, however slowly. I 
understand that today social protests have become more intense, 
and certain tensions have built up because people can already 
feel, which is based not only on their intuition but also on 
facts and observations, that it is rising. Now, the question 
arises... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That wage increases are being 
given? 
  [Kolodko] I would not like to use the word given because 
this keeps us in the epoch of the Polish People's Republic: 
Either someone gives something or it is obtained by fighting. 
What one actually can obtain by fighting is only poverty--the 
more strikes, the slower wage increases will be; the more 
strikes we stage, the more.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Talking about the strikes. 
What is your opinion on them? Do you agree with the opinion of 
those who claim that these are first of all political strikes, 
aimed at the coalition? 
  [Kolodko] I would not like to interpret them in this way. 
However, as an economist, I do not fully understand these 
strikes, and, frequently, when I observe the situation 
carefully, I can see that first there is a strike and only then 
do the strikers search for demands that should be submitted. 
After that, demands follow that have not been discussed 24 
hours or even 24 days beforehand. In this sense, one can 
interpret these strikes as political; however, all political 
players are involved in it--politicians who have certain 
ambitions, certain views. We often have disputes not over the 
differences of views but over the differences of interests. This 
is why it is next to impossible to reach an agreement, a 
consensus, because the interests are different. Now, if I were 
to look at this from the standpoint of a nurse, a physician, a 
teacher, a miner, or a driver, I can understand the people's 
reaction: When they hear that our economy is already developing, 
that the situation is good and is to improve, it is 
understandable that they would like to benefit from this as 
well. The mechanism that is supposed to resolve these 
difficulties must be institutionalized. We place great emphasis 
on the negotiations of the trilateral commission. We treat it 
very seriously, and, from the point of view of... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] During the negotiations in the 
trilateral commission, it was promised...[Woyciechowski pauses] 
Actually, it was not you who promised it. Representatives of 
the Finance Ministry promised that the personal income tax would 
be less severe. What is your opinion on this? 
  [Kolodko] It will not really be less severe. The unionists 
want this: If the next tax bracket is exceeded, the person who 
exceeds it should be able to pay the tax along with his or her 
spouse. In that case, the advance payments should not be made. 
We have calculated this in the Finance Ministry--what the 
financial result of such an operation is in a year. It has also 
been discussed before. An agreement is possible here, and we 
are arriving at such an agreement, which the government, 
wherever there is.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, will the tax be less 
severe or not? You protested when I said that it would be. 
  [Kolodko] Well, it will be less severe if we look at it from 
the viewpoint of the entire year. It is a certain concession 
for those taxpayers. However, it is a matter that does not make 
any greater perturbations in the sphere of public finances. In 
this area, the government is reaching an agreement with the 
trade unions. However, I would like such matters to be regulated 
quite unequivocally when the budget law is prepared. Again, I 
am a realist, but I will now tell you this anecdotal story: I 
recently visited Japan, and, in this country, people are allowed 
to stage strikes only in March because the budget enters the 
fiscal year on 1 April, and, once the budget has been passed by 
a democratically elected parliament, then, in a democratic 
society, there comes the time of hard work.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then you would like a similar 
situation in Poland? Would you like one month to be chosen for 
strikes? August, for instance? 
  [Kolodko] You know, actually I would not like any strikes in 
Poland. I believe that, in a more or less normal situation, 
which we are more and more, it is possible to reach agreement 
even on very difficult issues. I am a realist, and I do not 
think we will reach a situation in Poland where there will be no 
strikes at all. I can imagine.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is it possible in Poland today 
to fulfill the election promises made by the Polish Peasant 
Party and the Democratic Left Alliance? 
  [Kolodko] This depends on how they are interpreted and 
over what period they should be fulfilled. The foundation of my 
economic policy or my view of he economic policy is the 
necessity of prolonging time. I assume that the work we are 
going to do will be done in the constitutional period of one 
term. 
  [Woyciechowski] This is what you discussed in the Sejm--the 
medium-term program, the medium-term strategy. This medium term 
means how many years? 
  [Kolodko] Yes, I am even working on a strategic program, I 
would say. I would like to add, however, that a strategy is 
implemented over a longer period than terms of governments, even 
in stable societies.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is six, seven, or eight 
years? 
  [Kolodko] Six, seven, or eight. Let us say.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] This is, then, the economic 
program on which you are working. 
  [Kolodko] Of the year 2000. Yes. However, what this 
government must try to implement is a medium-term strategy. 
Because I am also the finance minister, I attach great 
importance to the preparation of the so-called medium-term 
financial strategy. In this area, we have reached a certain 
creative agreement with the president of the National Bank of 
Poland. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, what will the situation 
in Poland look like in two or three years? How high will 
inflation be? How much will our incomes increase? How much 
will the zloty be devaluated? 
  [Kolodko] I think that, in three years, the situation in 
Poland will be noticeably better, which does not mean that all 
groups will be the beneficiaries.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How high will inflation be? 
  [Kolodko] In three years, if we manage to implement our 
economic policy, inflation will near the level of approximately 
10 or 12 percent.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is, just like Hungary 
today? 
  [Kolodko] Well, it is still very high inflation. This 
should be clear. Compared to Western standards--jthe OECD or 
the European Union--it is very high inflation. However, if we 
take into account the inflationary hell in which we have been in 
recent years.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How much will our incomes 
increase within three years--2 percent, maybe more? 
  [Kolodko] Well, more. According to the calculations of the 
Central Planning Administration, which concerns the increase in 
the GDP, it is estimated that real wages this year may increase 
more than was envisioned in the budget law. What you said--that 
is, 2, 3, or 4 percent--is guaranteed this year. If.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] They will increase more. What 
do you mean by 5 or 6 percent? 
  [Kolodko] Within this year or within three years? 
  [Woyciechowski] This year? 
  [Kolodko] No, this year I believe they will increase 3 to 
3.5 percent.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That makes 10-12 percent 
within three years, does it not? 
  [Kolodko] They can certainly increase that much. We will 
also have money for much faster increases in investments, for 
financing growth and development, because this policy must 
really be very prodevelopment. We must think increasingly more 
about future generations, not only about this present-day 
consumption. 
  [Woyciechowski] How high will the devaluation of the zloty 
be? In the Sejm, you promised to defend the Polish currency. Is 
it not going to be devaluated so often? 
  [Kolodko] It is not devaluated very often. That is, on the 
one hand, we must implement the policy of strengthening the 
currency so that this will further stabilize the economy and 
influence macroeconomic stabilization; on the other hand, we are 
still faced with the dilemma of to what extent we should take 
advantage of the exchange rate as an instrument of shaping the 
current circulation. On the one hand, there is a certain 
temptation; there is pressure, especially from groups linked to 
exports, to devaluate the zloty because this makes exports more 
profitable and restricts the import trends. Right now there are 
no reasons to head for a faster and greater devaluation. There 
is only the question of when we will pass to the stage of 
shaping the exchange rates more freely within the framework of 
the interbank system. For the time being, we are employing the 
so-called crawling pack [preceding two words in English]--that 
is, adjusting monthly devaluation, based on the basket of 
currencies. There is the question of on what level this ratio 
should be. Now, earlier you asked about the causes of 
inflation; one of these causes is such a mechanism of 
devaluation: If the Central Bank devalues the currency by 1.6 
percent a month, it sends information to all consumers and 
manufacturers that the price of foreign currencies goes up by 
the average of 1.6 percent a month. More or less, in the same 
rate, the price of everything else goes up as well. This gives 
a signal to what we economists call inflationary expectations.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The Central Bank is 
partially to blame for this inflation? Is it Ms. Waltz? 
  [Kolodko] It is not the fault of Ms. Waltz or the Central 
Bank because it is both the cause and the result. This mechanism 
also consists in the following: We adjust the price of money to 
the costs that go up for other reasons. I do not want to say a 
banal thing--here everything depends on everything else. It is 
a very complex system of interdependencies. The point is that 
we should quietly and gradually reach the lower levels of the 
crawling pack [preceding two words in English]. It is possible 
that, from time to time--now this time has not yet come, that we 
will have to make a correctional devaluation. However, the main 
goal is to stabilize the exchange rate, and this is the function 
of inflation. On the other hand, this inflation is the function 
of.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] This is what you call the 
protection of the Polish currency. What about the 
denominations? Do you like the bank notes with six zeros? When 
will the zeros be less numerous? 
  [Kolodko] I do not like them. This sometimes makes 
calculations quite complex. Our views are clear: The currency 
in Poland must be redenominated. Work is under way.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Will this be done in January 
or a year later? 
  [Kolodko] I would like us to be ready with this on 31 
December.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] At the end of the year. The 
last question. I have read in the papers today that, on Monday 
[9 May], the government will go to Lansk for two days, to that 
magnificent residence--this time not for a rest but for a 
session of the government. Why is the government escaping from 
Warsaw and hiding in the Lansk forest to hold a session? 
  [Kolodko] Well, I do not know.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is this going to be a secret 
session? 
  [Kolodko] I think this will be done because the waiters 
there are not on strike. I do not know whether those residences 
are magnificent; I have never had the pleasure of visiting them. 
I will go there for the first time and in this new role of 
mine. Now, seriously. Prime Minister Pawlak proposed such a 
solution to have more time for a quiet, substantive, and lengthy 
discussion over this long-term strategy we are preparing. I 
would also like to present my concepts in greater detail. This 
is why we want to leave for Lansk. This was planned much 
earlier. The prime minister insists on this proposal. The idea 
is that we should go there, close the doors, as it were, and 
discuss issues in quiet.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Put aside the cellular 
telephones. 
  [Kolodko] Also the cellular telephones, which sometimes are 
a distraction--they make people concentrate on things outside 
rather than on the issues we are supposed to discuss. I think 
then we will know more questions. I also believe we will be 
able to answer some of them. Now, I also said this in the Sejm: 
I treat very seriously the principle of "Nothing About Us 
Without Us." I hope that we--my colleagues in the government and 
I--will be able to discuss these issues here with you and the 
listeners quite often. I hope we will be able to subject this 
to public evaluation, that we will argue and debate, until we 
feel pain. However, I hope we will not strike because strikes.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, who will feel the 
pain, the ministers or the people? 
  [Kolodko] Well, sometimes we will all feel the pain because 
we will have arguments about how to distribute the effects of 
the growing work efficiency. Now, the process will be difficult 
all the time. Everyone who is involved in it will feel the 
pain.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Will everyone feel the pain 
equally? 
  [Kolodko] No, because it will be fair--fair means unequal. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thank you for the interview, Mr. Minister. 
  [Kolodko] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas by </F>
Maria Graczyk; place and date not given: "Destination: West"] 
  [Text] [Graczyk] The signing of a treaty between Poland 
and Lithuania on friendly relations and good neighborly 
cooperation, is just the first step on the road to agreement. 
  [Brazauskas] More steps will follow shortly. Order must be 
finally instated at the border between our two countries -- we 
are striving not only at reviving contacts among people, but 
also at facilitating the flow of merchandise. This has an 
enormous significance for bilateral trade and transit from the 
Scandinavian countries, Russia, and the Far East, to Poland and 
to the West. This could become a major source of revenue for 
both our countries. 
  I also appreciate the significance of cultural ties and of 
ordinary human interactions, I mean in particular Poles living 
in Lithuania and Lithuanians living in Poland. So far, there 
has been a great deal of talk about this but right now -- after 
the signing of the treaty -- various organizations and 
associations will have the opportunity to spread their wings. 
They will be able to solve problems concerning national 
minorities that have not been settled yet or to which we have 
not paid enough attention. The treaty creates many 
opportunities, and it is up to us whether we will avail 
ourselves of these opportunities and to what extent we will 
improve our mutual relations which are burdened with historical 
legacies. Let us not forget that we are neighbors. That creates 
a commitment. 
  [Graczyk] But both sides continue to be very distrustful of 
each other and old prejudices often emerge in various 
discussions. 
  [Brazauskas] We have been meeting various Lithuanian 
citizens so I can say we do not value enough those contacts that 
are already in place. While talking to Poles living in 
Lithuania, I have never noticed that they have any political 
problems. Sure, they have economic problems, like all of us. 
Contrary to popular views, Poles and Lithuanians live alongside 
each other in peace in this country and there is no hostility 
between them. 
  [Graczyk] But your optimism is not shared by many 
politicians on both sides of the border. 
  [Brazauskas] Well, unfortunately some of those politicians 
incite and demonize problems which would not require this much 
attention under normal conditions. But I have faith that 
President Lech Walesa's historical visit to Lithuania will 
establish a long-awaited foundation for calming down moods and 
leaving complaints behind, both in Lithuania and in Poland. For 
some time to come, we have to take into account the noisy 
presence of "great patriots" who demand the impossible. 
  [Graczyk] Against this backdrop, do you not fear problems 
with ratifying the treaty in the Lithuanian parliament? 
  [Brazauskas] The most difficult stage is already behind us. 
There should be no problem with pushing the treaty through the 
Seimas [parliament], especially given that two-fifths of the 
votes will suffice for that purpose. I am sure we will manage 
to gain this many votes. Demonstrations and protests cannot 
change anything in that regard. After all, this is also about 
our security. 
  [Graczyk] The "Partnership for Peace" proposal has recently 
brought back the idea of a so-called Baltic Sea-Black Sea 
community. 
  [Brazauskas] It is just one of many ideas, nothing else. I 
am not an enthusiast of such alliances, especially military 
ones. My view is that we should have a uniform system of 
security for our countries. But economic alliances are a 
different story -- Baltic states already cooperate with one 
another very closely in many areas. So I think President Walesa 
will like the idea of developing cooperation between our three 
countries and the Visegrad group. I do not hide that we would 
be very interested in this kind of direction of development of 
our cooperation. After all, ever since we regained 
independence, we have been clearly saying: Destination -- West. 
  [Graczyk] During a recent meeting of the three Baltic 
states' presidents in Palanga, it was said, among others, that 
the Polish-Lithuanian treaty should become the first step on 
this road. 
  [Brazauskas] We agreed at the meeting that we will strive at 
making contacts with the Visegrad Group closer. It is an area 
of cooperation which suits us very much. I submitted exactly 
this proposal to President Walesa and I think that we will 
debate it further in Poland shortly.

<F P=106> [Report by "P.S.": "April Inflation: 2.5 Percent -- The </F>
Highest This Year"] 
  [Text] According to Finance Ministry estimates, 
inflation was 2.5 percent in April -- Jerzy Chabros of the 
Financial Policies and Analysis Department told NOWA EUROPA. 
Prices on services rose the most last month. 
  The 3.4-percent increase in prices for services was caused 
first of all by an increase in fees for central heating. Prices 
on food rose by 2.7 percent, prices on alcohol -- by 1.5 
percent, and prices on nonfood articles -- by 1.7 percent. The 
increase in inflation was higher in April than in March, but -- 
just as in previous months -- a decreasing trend was observed as 
the month went by. In the first 10 days of April, inflation was 
1.6 percent, in the second 10 days -- 0.7 percent, and in the 
third 10 days -- just 0.5 percent. Food prices -- which play a 
determinant role in shaping the rate of inflation -- rose in 
similar fashion. In the first 10 days of April, these prices 
rose by 1.7 percent, in the second 10 days -- by 0.7 percent, 
and in the third 10 days -- by 0.4 percent. According to Central 
Office of Statistics data, in the last 10 days of April, prices 
rose by 2.8 percent compared with the third 10 days of March. 
Prices on potatoes and vegetables rose the most, that is by 9.3 
percent. The price of flour rose by just 0.5 percent, while the 
price of bread -- by 0.9 percent. 
  According to Reuters, Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said 
Thursday [5 May] that the Polish National Bank [NBP] should slow 
down the monthly devaluation of the zloty because the 
devaluation is a factor which accelerates inflation. The 
minister also said that there is currently no need for a rapid 
devaluation of the zloty. According to NBP Deputy Chairman 
Witold Kozinski, a slowdown in the constant devaluation is 
beneficial but it is too early now to implement specific 
measures.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonia Vymazalova: "Sidonia Will Be Set Apart </F>
From Horne Srnie and Annexed to the Czech Republic; Slovak 
Government Revoked Resolution of Its Predecessor"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava -- The Slovak Government held its 
regular meeting yesterday with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik as 
chairman. Among the first points on the agenda was the 
discussion and approval of a proposal to release funds for this 
year's financing of the reconstruction of Grassalkovich Palace 
in Bratislava, which is going to become the seat of the 
president of the Slovak Republic. The government agreed with the 
continued work on the reconstruction of the palace and 
appropriated 50 million Slovak korunas [Sk] as temporary 
financial assistance. 
  The minister of finance was charged with submitting to 
parliament an amendment to the Law on the State Budget of the 
Slovak Republic for 1994 and on changes to some other laws, 
under which the budget of the Office of the President will be 
increased by Sk100 million. The increase in expenditure will be 
allocated for the purpose of the technical reconstruction of the 
seat of the president. 
  The government yesterday revoked its predecessor's 
Resolution 
220 of 8 March 1994 on the report on the activity of the Joint 
Slovak-Czech Border Commission and on the state of work on 
delineating the border in 1993. It fully approved conclusions 
from the January 1994 talks between the ministers of interior of 
Slovakia and the Czech Republic concerning expedient changes to 
the borderline. On the basis of this approval, it charged the 
minister of interior with ensuring, through the Slovak 
delegation to the Border Commission, the implementation of the 
proposed expedient changes to the border between Slovakia and 
the Czech Republic in the following localities: the Sidonia 
settlement on the territory of Horne Srnie in the district of 
Trencin (to be annexed to the Czech Republic); the U Sabotu 
settlement on the territory of Velky Javornik in the district of 
Hodonin (to be annexed to the Slovak Republic); and along the 
waterways Morava, Sudomerice creek, Skalice creek, and Moravka. 
Explaining the cancellation of the resolution at a news 
conference following the government meeting, Minister of 
Interior Ladislav Pittner said that Vladimir Meciar's cabinet 
did not agree with the Sidonia settlement being annexed to the 
Czech Republic as compensation for the annexation of the U 
Sabotu hamlet to the Slovak Republic. As regards the Kasarne 
recreational area, which is part of the community of Makov, 
Cadca district, Pittner said that the border here is a 
historical border and the Slovak Republic has no reason to call 
it into question. A decision on the problem of Kasarne is to be 
made by the two prime ministers in the near future. [passage 
omitted] 
  The government discussed a proposal to carry out the 
training 
of UN personnel from the Pakistani Armed Forces (PAF) in the 
Slovak Republic. It decided to submit the proposal to the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic for approval. It 
approved the proposal to appoint Professor Fedor Macasek, doctor 
of natural sciences, as state secretary at the Ministry of 
Education and Science.
