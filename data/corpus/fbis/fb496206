<F P=106> [Article by "wk," "ski," and "dom": "Mother Stabilization"] </F>
  [Text] According to Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime 
minister and finance minister, to achieve a stabilization that 
is to be the mother of Poland's economic success and to maintain 
the growth rate, one must construct fiscal policies in a way 
that is conducive to the people saving more money. But "the 
government is still not clear on how to accomplish that." 
  "If it were not for last year's strikes, the government or 
parliament would not have to raise taxes," Minister Kolodko said 
during a meeting with regional press journalists. "Those who 
decide to be on strike must know that they do it at the cost of 
those who work hard at the very same time." 
  The new chief of finance is eager to see a comprehensive tax 
law and banking law: "We must continue to send messages to 
business people that it pays to invest and that they will have 
to overcome fewer unnecessary problems in the future," Kolodko 
said yesterday. 
  He also announced that there are no plans to raise the rates 
of indirect taxes (VAT [value-added tax], the excise tax, and 
customs duties). But he wants to have a situation where more 
companies than now would pay taxes, with all types of breaks and 
waivers being documented exclusively with VAT receipts. This 
would limit the economic "gray area." 
  Minister Kolodko also anounced that monies for 20,000 job 
openings in the customs police will be found in the near future, 
and "then we will get real serious on that." Tax obligations 
due from enterprises will be collected with more efficiency: 
"We will act much the same way as the mighty ones from the 
London or Paris Club act with relation to Poland." 
  Minister Kolodko intends to change the principles of the 
zloty's devaluation "sooner rather than later"--the dollar will 
get more expensive at a slower rate (the monthly rate right now 
is 1.6 percent). According to Kolodko, this would reduce the 
inflation rate. 
  Minister Kolodko does not plan to make any amendments to 
this 
year's budget, despite the fact that revenue is higher by a few 
trillion zlotys [Z] compared with initial plans, because he 
fears that "there may occur a reversal of the situation." 
  Kolodko believes that, in three years' time, he will manage 
to foster a significant reduction in the budget deficit--that 
is, to a level of about 2 percent of the GDP. This year's 
Budget Law provides that the budget deficit will be Z83 
trillion, which is about 4.1 percent of the GDP. Kolodko also 
portrays himself as "a fervent enthusiast of privatization." 
But he expressed criticism of privatization policies conducted 
by recent governments because "enterprises were sold too cheaply 
and, because of that, the state budget was losing 5 percent of 
the GDP per year."

<F P=106> [Article by "old" on interview with Privatization Minister </F>
Wieslaw Kaczmarek in Warsaw; date not given: "Poland Trying To 
Win Investment From Germany"] 
  [Text] Warsaw--"German companies are still very cautious 
in Poland. We would like far more involvement." Wieslaw 
Kaczmarek, the new minister for privatization in Polish Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet, considers the Polish market 
of 38 million potential consumers an "enormous opportunity" for 
foreign investors. Compared with the total direct investment of 
some $3.5 billion, Germany, at some $280 million, ranks only 
fourth behind the United States, Italy, and the Netherlands. 
  "The Czech market has long been depleted. Now it is Poland's 
turn," the minister said in an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG. He was referring to a 4-percent growth last year, which 
boosted Poland to the top of the East European states. This 
year's growth is expected to reach at least that figure. 
  The leftist government does not feel committed to any 
ideological concepts, Kaczmarek pointed out. "Privatization can 
no longer be stopped. We are long past the crucial point. 
Poland will stick to its market economy course," the minister 
said. He himself is a member of the Social Democratic Party, 
the party that is generally considered to be the successor to 
the communist cadre organization. Today, young technocrats who 
are committed to the market economy are in control. 
  Kaczmarek pointed out that he wants to step up the speed of 
privatization. "We have to take more risks," the minister said. 
Especially medium-sized companies that are still state-owned and 
employ up to 500 people shall be sold "quickly and cheaply." 
The German Trust Agency is to serve as a model. Kaczmarek: 
"We may very well sell the companies at one-fifth of their 
actual value. What is more important is that the investors 
create new jobs." 
  The bold minister candidly admits that further privatization 
meets with massive reservations by the population and the trade 
unions. The fear of losing jobs is just one side of the coin. 
At the same time, the fear of selling off Poland to foreign 
combines is increasing. "We can only counteract this by 
presenting good solutions for privatization," Kaczmarek 
emphasized. 
  The government is taking a more cautious line with big 
companies, such as the Ursus truck company, where there have 
repeatedly been conflicts with the Solidarnosc trade union. 
Ursus is to be restructured and reorganized. "Privatizing it 
is impossible at the moment," the minister said. 
  Ten largely independent joint-stock companies are to operate 
within a holding company in the future. There will be some 
foreign capital involved, but the trade union insists on 
employees holding at least 50 percent of the shares. Despite 
efforts by the Ursus management to step up marketing activities, 
capacity utilization is only 50 percent. The 9,500 
employees--in 1989, the group still employed 15,000 
people--produce everything themselves, starting from bolts and 
going to diesel oil filters. This wide production range 
prevents the urgently needed rise in productivity. 
  Privatization Minister Kaczmarek thinks that a total of 
1,500 
to 2,000 big companies still have a difficult restructuring 
phase ahead of them. The first step is changing these firms 
into joint-stock companies. The government is also hoping for 
foreign financial and management aid. "The only realistic 
solution is the long-term privatization of big companies, which 
must, however, fetch a good price," the minister said. 
  The private sector already accounts for 50 percent of the 
GNP. Together with the Czech Republic and Hungary, Poland holds 
a top position in East Europe. Some 60 percent of all people in 
gainful employment, including agriculture, work for private 
enterprises. But there is still a long way to go until 
privatization is completed. So far, some 2,300 of the 8,450 
former state-owned companies have found a new owner. In a 
so-called mass privatization, 470 firms are to be divided up 
into 16 or 17 investment funds, of which the population can 
obtain shares. 
  Kaczmarek wants to complete the reprivatization of companies 
by the end of 1995. A law on returning possessions expropriated 
under the communist government is being worked out. According 
to Kaczmarek, 400,000 applications have been received--from a 
water mill to a textile factory. Claims amount to 30 billion 
German marks, Kaczmarek said.

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has expressed 
satisfaction with the Vienna agreement. He was informed about it 
by Mate Granic and Kresimir Zubak upon their return from Vienna. 
Haris Silajdzic, head of the Muslim delegation, described the 
agreement as the most specific step toward peace, the 
implementation of the Washington agreement, and the constitution 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. President Alija 
Izetbegovic said that the agreement is a good one, but that the 
Muslims will continue to insist on a unitary state and on 
preserving its external borders.

<F P=106>   [Editorial Report] Recent issues of Croatian dailies have </F>
reported and discussed two Croatian Government decisions: to 
suspend the Statute of the County of Istria, including 
guarantees of minority-language equality to the indigenous 
Italian population, and to establish a Council for Istria as "an 
advisory body to the Presidency of Croatia." 
  The Ministry of Administration, according to its 18 April 
announcement, has suspended the implementation of the Statute of 
the County of Istria on the basis of Article 80 of the Croatian 
Law on Local Self-Management and Administration (VJESNIK, 19 
April; SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, 19 April). This was done, the 
ministry says, because regulations in several articles of the 
statute contradict the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, 
the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms, the 
Constitutionsl Law on the Rights of Ethnic and National 
Communities or Minorities in the Republic of Croatia, and other 
laws. The announcement states that the Government of Croatia has 
obligated the Ministry of Administration to examine thoroughly 
the statute of every county, in accordance with the ministry's 
responsibilities under the Law on Local Self-Management and 
Administration. In cases in which a regulation in a county 
statute is found to be unconstitutional or illegal, charges will 
be brought before Croatia's Constitutional Court. 
  Reacting in the 19 April VJESNIK to the Ministry of 
Administration's decision, Dino Debeljuh, a member of the 
Istrian Democratic Congress (IDS) and a delegate in the Croatian 
Assembly, defended the statute but said the move by the Ministry 
of Administration was to be expected. "In any case, the opinions 
on the rights and protection of the Italian minority of the IDS, 
as the ruling party in Istria, are totally different from those 
of the top state leadership. With this statute, we 
simultaneously gave the top state leadership the opportunity to 
accept the standards of Western Europe and to recognize the 
right of the Italian minority to retain the level of rights it 
has had up until now. The Statute of the County of Istria merely 
sanctions the existing rights of the Italian minority and, in 
addition, harmonizes these rights with those of the Italians in 
the Slovene part of Istria, and all of this is in accordance 
with the memorandum signed by the Republic of Croatia and the 
Republic of Italy, by which Croatia promised that the Italians 
in the Croatian part of Istria would have the same rights and 
protection as those in the Slovene part. In no way does the 
Statute of the County of Istria exceed those rights. The statute 
does not contradict the Constitution or laws of the Republic of 
Croatia." 
  Asked how the inhabitants of Istria would react to the 
suspension, Debeljuh responded: "This is one more in a series of 
decisions by the top Croatian leadership that does not 
contribute to the improvement of its relations with Istria." He 
stressed that he found especially worrisome the fact that this 
was happening at a time when the right was gaining prominence in 
Italy and might use the "hardline" position of Zagreb to 
"promote its views toward Istria." This shows, he added, that 
such actions by the top leadership do not benefit Croatia. 
  The same issue of VJESNIK carried a report by the Croatian 
press agency HINA on the IDS response to the Croatian 
Government's decision to establish an advisory council for 
Istria. Following a meeting of the IDS Council in Pazin on 16 
April, the party issued a statement signed by its president, 
Ivan Jakovcic. The statement said that the IDS did not accept 
the manner in which this council was founded, pointing out that 
the assembly and government of Istria County had not been 
consulted. Thus, the statement continued, "the President of the 
Republic of Croatia, Dr. Franjo Tudjman, subconsciously 
confirmed the separateness of Istria in the Republic of 
Croatia." The IDS statement called on Tudjman "to set up 
councils for Dalmatia, Slavonija, Baranja, and other regions of 
the Republic of Croatia which need to be given more attention 
than Istria." 
  The 20 April issue of VJESNIK reports that the Istria County 
Government had also protested the suspension of the county 
statute and the founding of the council for Istria, saying that 
it considered the actions "unnecessary and incomprehensible," 
especially because "not a single legally elected member of the 
county government" had been appointed to the advisory council. 
The government, according to VJESNIK, also said it was 
"indicative" of the Tudjman government's attitude toward Istria 
that the local government had to "find out about all of this in 
the media." 
  The same issue of VJESNIK published "a message to Istrians 
from the Office of the President of the Republic of Croatia" 
stating that, "in view of the fact that the council had been 
founded as a nonpolitical, expert, and nonparty advisory body to 
the president of the republic, the Istria County Assembly and 
all other interested organizations and associations are invited 
to propose candidates for membership on the council of Istria." 
  SLOBODNA DALMACIJA in its 21 April issue reported that the 
Council of Istria has 17 members and that Monsignor Josip 
Pavlisic, retired archbishop of the Rijeka-Senj diocese, had 
been "elected" its president. The paper describes Pavlisic as an 
authority on Istria, where he was born 80 years ago. Pavlisic, 
asked by SLOBODNA DALMACIJA how he had been elected president of 
the council, stated that he had been contacted by telephone with 
the offer "several days ago" and had accepted, "although I have 
been absent from Istria for 42 years." He told the paper that 
the council members had not met yet, but "I was told that the 
council consists of many people who will advise the president of 
the republic regarding various sectors of life." Asked whether, 
as president of the council, he had influenced the selection of 
its members, Pavlisic responded: "The president of the republic 
nominated the members. All this happened for me out of the blue." 
  Discussing what Istria means to him, Pavlisic observed that 
the area had the potential for a bright future. He warned, 
however, that people in Istria are discouraged with the 
situation in Croatia and unhappy about their small salaries and 
pensions. He said that there is a danger that they may turn 
toward Italy "because they are not all idealists and they have 
to survive from day to day." Asked to comment on the "stormy" 
press reaction to the founding of the council, Pavlisic 
responded that charges that everyone on the council was a member 
of Tudjman's party, the Croatian Democratic Community, HDZ, were 
not accurate: "I, for one, am not an HDZ member, nor am I a 
member of any other party."

  [Excerpt] Milan Babic, minister for foreign affairs of the 
republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], told a TANJUG correspondent in 
Knin today that the government delegation of the RSK would not 
set any preconditions for the next round of talks on 
humanitarian and economic issues with a delegation of the 
Republic of Croatia. 
  Krajina's demand -- for the negotiating process to continue 
in Geneva on 18 May at the headquarters of the Conference on the 
Former Yugoslavia -- comes as a result of Croatia's refusal to 
hold negotiations in "the buffer zone" in Turanj near Karlovac, 
Babic explained. Our insistence on holding negotiations in 
Turanj would be perceived as a blockade on our part of the 
negotiating process, the RSK foreign minister says. 
  We have opted for further negotiations without attaching any 
conditions as we believe that this is our contribution to peace 
in the area of the former Yugoslavia and that this is the way to 
a final political solution that will recognize the right of 
self-determination to all the people in the area of the former 
Yugoslavia, Babic explained. He, however, stressed the problem 
of equality in the negotiating process because UN Security 
Council Resolution 820, as he said, undermines further 
negotiations. In this context, Babic stressed that ways will be 
examined of lifting the sanctions against the Serbian people, 
that is the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Srpska republic, 
and the republic of Serb Krajina. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Jovan Vlajkovic from Okucani] </F>
  [Text] Overnight and yesterday, the Croatian Army on two 
occasions violated the signed agreement in Western Slavonia. 
The first instance occurred yesterday at around 0900, when 
Croatian planes violated the airspace in the region of the 
village of Zagalici, 7 km east of Okucani. The second instance 
occurred in the course of the night, when Croat Army troops in 
the region of the village of Bujici, 4 km northeast of Novska, 
opened small arms fire on the positions of the Serbian Krajina 
army. The command of the 18th Corps of the Serbian Krajina army 
has lodged a sharp protest with the UN Protection Forces and has 
warned of the possible consequences of such conduct by the 
Croatian side.

  [Text] Today the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] 
parliamentary group deposited at the office of the National 
Assembly a motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov due to his inability to organize and lead the Council of 
Ministers. The aim of the SDS is evidently to forestall the 
prime minister's statement on structural and personnel changes 
in the cabinet that he is expected to make next Thursday, our 
reporter Antoaneta Puncheva points out. 
  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's proposal for structural and 
personnel changes in the government will be discussed at a 
special plenum of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], BSP 
leader Zhan Videnov stated at today's meeting of BSP deputies. 
The BSP deputies reported after the meeting that the plenum 
will be scheduled for the day when the prime minister officially 
presents his cabinet's program intentions in parliament, so the 
exact date is not clear at the moment. 
  The deputies of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD] decided 
at their meeting today not to support Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov's expected proposal on structural and personnel changes in 
the Council of Ministers. 
  All the political forces, especially those in the 
parliamentary center, should reach a consensus on the cabinet 
shuffle, even at the cost of making compromises -- this was the 
common view of Ahmed Dogan, DPS [Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms] leader, and Aleksandur Tomov, leader of the Civic 
Alliance for the Republic. They had a long discussion in 
parliament today, the main subject of which was the government 
changes. According to Tomov, Dogan and he found that they 
shared quite a number of common viewpoints in their positions. 
  Regarding the hardline position of the NSD deputies not to 
take part in the vote on Professor Berov's program, Aleksandur 
Tomov expects a slow but sure evolution in the views of the 
parties and organizations in the NSD group, and Ahmed Dogan 
predicts the same. The idea of forming a new cabinet within the 
term of the present parliament is not a bad one, Aleksandur 
Tomov thinks, but at the moment it is simply unrealistic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Lezsak, executive chairman of the </F>
Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Istvan Joo; place and date not 
given: "We Cannot Expect Self-Restraint From the Winner"] 
  [Text] [Joo] Why was there such a big gap between the 
expectations of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the 
result of the voting? 
  [Lezsak] I do not believe that the country voted against the 
change of the regime, and not really against us, either. People 
probably made this decision because of the afflictions and 
disappointment. I am very sorry that even the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP] did not manage to take over and 
save what was impossible for us to keep because the majority of 
voters lost confidence in us. We knew that we would reach fewer 
votes at these elections than in 1990; nevertheless, we were 
quite wrong in our estimates. It is only now, with hindsight, 
that we can precisely see that the country felt that it had been 
unable to have a say in the details of changing the regime. In 
a period when more than 400 laws had to be passed, dialogue was 
forced into the background because of the pressure of time. 
  [Joo] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which gained 
the second largest number of votes, now claims that it is the 
alternative to the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] which has so 
far dominated by far. 
  [Lezsak] This is a campaign trick of the SZDSZ. This is the 
only chance of the Free Democrats to gain many mandates. This 
is a temporary phenomenon; after the second round, the SZDSZ 
will be seeking the factors that link it with the MSZP. This is 
leading directly to their coalition. 
  [Joo] It is a common occurrence that the big losers of the 
first round face further difficulties in the second round 
because many people like to stand by the winners.... 
  [Lezsak] We are over the abyss. It is impossible to make 
the failure of the first round any worse. We have realistically 
assessed our possibilities: Every single electoral district 
that we win can only improve our situation. 
  [Joo] Will the MDF's basic political attitude change in the 
new situation? According to some speculations, a move over to 
the right, and according to others, a move in the liberal 
direction can be expected. 
  [Lezsak] We will continue to represent the MDF's fundamental 
values -- this party will remain in the center right. We began 
to reorganize the MDF in the autumn of 1993. The result of this 
was that we managed to remain in the contest in more than 100 
electoral districts and avoided a total defeat. It seems that 
we will be the strongest opposition party in the new parliament. 
The MDF has some experience from the period before 1990. For 
the first time, a period is starting when we have to fulfill our 
tasks having gained experience both in opposition and in 
government. Our main goal is to prevent the situation from 
falling back to the level of a tamed dictatorship. 
  [Joo] Will there be another four years, a full parliamentary 
cycle? 
  [Lezsak] In the interest of the country's stability, the 
protection of domestic and Western investments, and new owners, 
it is essential for the new parliament to operate undisturbed. 
It would be a crime against the country's security if we 
questioned these four years. 
  [Joo] Do you think that the MDF will be given as big a scope 
for maneuver from the victorious political opponents as they 
received in 1990 from the MDF? 
  [Lezsak] I do not think that the MSZP-SZDSZ government will 
be capable of self-restraint. The negative experiences of the 
past four years confirm the feeling in me that the discrediting 
of the MDF and some of its politicians will be continued -- now 
on a governmental level. 
  [Joo] Do you feel that the MDF is responsible for the fact 
that the media organs that were fair to it are left without any 
guarantees for survival? 
  [Lezsak] We already admitted earlier, not only with 
hindsight, that the MDF and the government did not have enough 
strength to create a sound media organization. It has to be 
acknowledged that, between 1988 and 1990, the MSZP had prepared 
its media policy for the past four years very professionally. 
However, we were not incompetent, rather, we were forced to 
concentrate on other issues.

<F P=106> [Interview with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu by </F>
an unidentified correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [O GLOBO] How is the Romanian program of economic 
reforms getting along? 
  [Vacaroiu] The revolution in December 1989 marked not only a 
break with the totalitarian regime; it also launched a process 
of radical transformations in political relations. It thus 
established the basis for a democratic state of rights and for 
an economic reconstruction based on market mechanisms. 
  In November 1992 we began to implement a social economic 
strategy that will be in force until 1996. In 1993 the 
government adopted measures to speed up the reforms by 
deregulating prices, eliminating subsidies on some goods and 
services, and introducing the goods movement tax. In industry, 
privatization provoked new steps and stimulated the activities 
of medium and small enterprises. 
  [O GLOBO] How can bilateral economic relations be developed? 
  [Vacaroiu] Bilateral trade last year totaled $54 million and 
this does not satisfy us. Our two countries recently signed the 
Economic Cooperation and Trade Accord, which eliminates the old 
compensation system and allows economic agents to sign import 
and export contracts within the context of the free market 
economy. Romania is interested in balancing its trade with 
Brazil. We hope to resume exporting Romanian-made railroad cars 
and tractors. We will continue to export fertilizers and plan 
to sell cars manufactured in Romania on the Brazilian market. 
We will import Brazilian iron and manganese ore, soybeans, and 
other products. 
  Romania has an increasing interest in investing in Brazilian 
companies; the number of Romanian-Brazilian mixed capital 
companies has increased to 15, and their capital totals nearly 
$50,000. 
  [O GLOBO] What has the Romanian Government been doing to 
improve the people's standard of living? 
  [Vacaroiu] The economic reform has had a high social cost 
and 
made an already precarious situation even worse. The end of the 
economic decline in 1993 and the recovery expected for 1994 will 
allow the people to improve their standard of living in the 
second half of this year. The government is adopting social 
protection measures for all strata of the population, especially 
the most destitute. Salaries and pensions will be protected 
from inflation by deindexation and we will reduce the imbalance 
between them. 
  [O GLOBO] What are the main objectives of the Romanian 
privatization program? 
  [Vacaroiu] For us, 1994 is the privatization year. By the 
end of 1993, the State Asset Fund had privatized 270 commercial 
corporations; 142 were privatized during the first months of 
1994, and 100 more still have yet to be privatized. Another 
2,000 commercial enterprises may be transferred to the private 
sector. The people will be able to buy shares of these companies 
or exchange certificates they already have for shares. 
  [O GLOBO] How are representative democracy and political 
participation getting along? 
  [Vacaroiu] The Constitution grants all citizens full 
democratic rights. We have a multiparty system. Romanians are 
interested in politics -- as a result of our Latin temperament, 
sometimes too interested. Compared to countries like the former 
Yugoslavia and the USSR, Romania is an island of stability in 
East Europe. 
  [O GLOBO] What about bilateral cultural exchanges? 
  [Vacaroiu] We signed a five-year accord for cultural 
cooperation in 1991, which must be extended. For example, two 
works of Brazilian literature were translated into Romanian in 
1993 (Antonio Olinto's "Copacabana," and Erico Verissimo's "The 
Time and the Wind"), and an exhibition of Romanian rugs in 
several regions of Brazil. In 1994, the National Theater of the 
city of Craiova will tour Brazil. 
  [O GLOBO] What advantages does Romania offer foreign 
investors? Are Brazilians investing in Romania? 
  [Vacaroiu] Our laws allow the establishment of commercial 
enterprises with 100-percent foreign capital, ensure there is no 
discrimination against foreign participation, and offer 
guarantees against expropriation. All regions and sectors of 
the country are open to foreigners, except the materiel 
industry, the manufacture of explosives, and the manufacture of 
psychotropic substances. 
  The Romanian Government stimulates investments through tax 
exemption for two to five years. We are, therefore, awaiting 
Brazilian investors. 
  [O GLOBO] Romania may be needing know-how [preceding word in 
English] in fields like managerial training, marketing 
[preceding word in English], quality control, market research, 
industrial modernization, administrative decentralization, and 
management of public works. Brazil has universities, 
organizations, and professionals specialized in these fields. 
Brazil can thus help the Romanian Government and the Romanian 
state-owned and private enterprises. Will you seek this sort of 
assistance? 
  [Vacaroiu] My objective is to visit these sectors and seek 
this sort of cooperation. The evolution of the bilateral trade 
relations is marked by integration processes that are currently 
under way in the South American continent as well as in the 
European continent. Romania wants to benefit from the valuable 
experience of other countries, including Brazil.

  [Text] After five days of negotiating at the U.S. Embassy 
in Vienna, the Croat-Muslim talks on the implementation of the 
Washington agreement have come to a successful end. The 
federation's external borders have been fixed, insomuch as the 
Croat and Muslim demands to the Serbs and to the international 
community are concerned. The internal cantonal organization, as 
well as the organization of the federation's and the 
government's leadership, have also been agreed upon. 
  The reports we have received say that the federation will 
have eight cantons, but it has not yet been agreed which ones 
will be purely Croat and which ones purely Muslim. All that is 
known is that four will go to the Muslims and two to the Croats. 
Some reports say that the Croatian cantons will include western 
Herzegovina and upper Posavina. Two cantons will be mixed. 
Tihomir Vinkovic has this report: 
  [Vinkovic] The agreement will formally be signed in Geneva 
on 
Saturday, 14 May. Kresimir Zubak, head of the Bosnian Croat 
delegation, said after the talks that the first president of the 
Bosniak-Muslim federation for the period of six months will be a 
Croat, while the first prime minister will be a Bosniak. Six of 
the 17 government ministries will go to Croats. The federation 
will encompass 58 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
over eight cantons. Croat people will constitute a majority in 
two cantons, Muslim people in four, while two will be mixed. 
The mixed cantons--one in central Bosnia with a seat in 
Travnik, and the other in the Neretva River basin with a seat in 
Mostar--will be administered on a parity basis in accordance 
with the 1991 census. 
  Zubak thanked the U.S. Embassy for its good services during 
the talks. He also thanked U.S. mediator Charles Redman and 
U.S. Ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina Viktor Jakovich. 
  Bosniak leader Haris Silajdzic said that this is a major 
step 
toward a peaceful solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
It is also a major step toward the preservation of the 
territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Silajdzic added. He expressed hope that not just Croats and 
Bosniaks, but also all those who consider Bosnia-Herzegovina as 
their homeland, will work toward the implementation of this 
agreement. He assessed the internal borders to be very 
democratic. Silajdzic also said it was a provisional agreement 
that will be submitted for adoption to the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Assembly. 
  Asked by a journalist whether the Serbs would agree to 
return 
part of the territory they had conquered so that the 
Croat-Bosniak federation could encompass 58 percent, Silajdzic 
said he hoped for help from the international community, which 
will not tolerate genocide. 
  As a confederal partner, I wish to congratulate Bosniaks and 
Croats on the serious talks and the agreement that I witnessed, 
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said. It is in Croatia's 
interest that this agreement is implemented, Minister Granic 
said in conclusion.

  [Text] We begin this newscast with the full text of the 
agreement on the Bosnian-Croat federation. 
  In accordance with the resolutions of the constituent 
assembly of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, its authorized 
representatives at a meeting held in Vienna 7-11 May 1994 
concluded the following agreement: 
  A proposal will be submitted to the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
constituent assembly that the first president of the federation 
for the interim six-month period will be a candidate from the 
Croat people and the vice president will be a candidate from the 
Bosnian people. On the expiry of the six-month period the post 
of president will be taken by a representative of the Bosnian 
people and that of vice president by a representative of the 
Croat people. 
  The first president of the federation following the interim 
period will come from the ranks of the Bosnian people. 
  In the coming government reconstruction it will be ensured 
that the post of prime minister goes to a representative of the 
Bosnian people and the post of deputy prime minister to a 
representative of the Croat people. The deputy prime minister 
will also head the Ministry of Defense. Under the draft law on 
the government of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, the 
government will comprise the prime minister, the deputy prime 
minister, 11 ministers with portfolio, and four ministers 
without portfolio. 
  Ministers from the Bosnian people will head the following 
ministries: Internal Affairs; Foreign Affairs; Transportation 
and Communications; Energy and Industry; Urban Development; 
Resources and Environment; Refugees and Social Policy; and the 
Ministry of Education, Science and Culture. 
  Ministers from the Croat people will head the following 
ministries: Defense in the person of the deputy prime minister; 
Finance; Justice; Trade; and Health. 
  Of the four ministers without portfolio, one will be from 
the 
Croat people. The territory of the federation was defined on 
the basis of the criteria agreed by both sides and attached to 
the agreement. The maps defining the territory of the 
federation and of the cantons constitute an integral part of the 
agreement. In the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina there will 
be two cantons with a special administrative arrangement 
[rezim]; their working names are the Central Bosnia and Neretva 
cantons. 
  In accordance with the above, arrangements will be proposed 
for inclusion in the constitution of the federation to ensure 
that, in line with the arrangements applicable in the 
federation, the cantons will guarantee equality to the 
constituent nations of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The harmonized text of the proposed changes to the 
constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is an 
integral part of the agreement. 
  The signatories of the agreement are committed to starting 
work immediately on setting up bodies of municipal authorities 
in accordance with the constitution of the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the areas where there are justified 
interests provisions will be made on the basis of common 
criteria defined in accordance with the constitution to redefine 
and change municipal borders. 
  A commission set up on a basis of parity will be formed to 
search for missing persons. 
  The signatories have agreed to recommend to the constituent 
assembly of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in accordance 
with the agreement, to pass relevant bills within its 
jurisdiction. 
  Following consultations with President Izetbegovic it was 
agreed that the first president of the federation in the interim 
six-month period should be from the ranks of the Croat people.

  [Text] FRY Prime Minister Radoje Kontic visited Jagodina 
and Curpija today. He said that the program of economic 
stabilization gave some encouraging results, but that the prices 
of especially services and agricultural produce are still very 
high. Our reporter asked the federal prime minister to comment 
on yesterday's statement by the governor of the National Bank of 
Yugoslavia, Dragoslav Avramovic, that the bank would not give 
any credits to the Federal Government before it has secured 
wheat. Let us listen what Radoje Kontic said: 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Radoslav Nikolic] How do you 
interpret the governor's statement that he will no longer give 
any credits to the Federal Government? 
  [Kontic] I did not hear this statement. However, I must 
immediately point our that there have been absolutely no 
problems in cooperation between the Federal Government and the 
National Bank of Yugoslavia so far. We have managed to resolve 
all the issues very quickly and efficiently to mutual 
satisfaction. I see no reason why this would not be the case in 
the coming period. If we share the same strategic goal, which 
we do, namely, the preservation of the dinar's stability, the 
preservation of the stability of prices, and, within this 
context, the reanimation of the overall economic activity and 
production, then I really see no reason why we could not agree 
on measures, mechanisms, and instruments with which we would 
accomplish such strategic goals. 
  [Nikolic] Mr. Prime Minister, the Federal Government has 
issued bonds with an 11 percent interest rate. To what extent 
has this damaged the economic program of stabilization? 
  [Kontic] Well, it is a well known fact that the federal 
budget suffers from a rather heavy budget deficit and this 
budget deficit can be actively serviced in two ways -- through 
money issue, which is inflationary and ill-advised, and through 
real sources of income. It is perfectly common in such 
situations for a government to issue bonds and in this way 
secure real sources of income from the financial market in order 
to cover the budget deficit. 
  In this particular case, this involved some 15 million FRY 
dinars, with which we had to settle obligations toward the 
Yugoslav Army, or to be precise, toward the military industry. 
Bearing in mind that the overall sources were de facto placed 
into the military industry, it is absolutely certain that they 
will serve the reanimation of production, that is, that they 
will comply with the realization of the program of economic 
stabilization. I personally believe that governor's remark did 
not refer to the fact that bonds were released, but to the 
conditions in which the bonds were released. We have 
acknowledged his suggestion and, in the future, we will, in 
agreement with the National Bank of Yugoslavia, define the 
conditions for the issue of bonds. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jergus Ferko and Viera Urbanova: "Moravcik's </F>
Coalition Has Sold Out Slovakia's State Interests; 
NEPSZABADSAG's Scandalous Revelation--Secret Agreement With 
Hungarian Parties"] 
  [Text] "Moravcik's government is hanging on the string of 
[ethnic Hungarian leader Miklos] Duray's pants," master of 
intellect Vladimir Minac said in a recent interview for 
REPUBLIKA. Many people suspected that the old man was right, and 
the Slovak Heritage Foundation demanded in vain that the 
coalition disclose the contents of its secret agreement with 
ethnic Hungarian parties. Let the Slovak public learn what 
promises had been made to Miklos Duray and Vojtech Bugar 
[chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement] for 
the support they give in Parliament to the fragile, actually 
minority coalition that is limping on both legs. As so many 
times before, the truth surfaced on the other side of the 
Danube, in the Hungarian press, in which our minority 
politicians tell completely different things than they say at 
home, things they would never dream of telling the Slovak 
public. On 14 March, the Hungarian left-wing daily NEPSZABADSAG 
(the largest Hungarian daily) carried the following scandalous 
information: 
  "According to Hungarian sources from Slovakia, Hungarian 
parties really did not wish to be represented in the new 
government (as they do not want to give Meciarites and 
nationalists the opportunity to play the Hungarian card), but 
they agreed with the other parties that their view would be 
taken into account in decisionmaking, particularly on ethnic 
issues. The foundations of this cooperation have been laid down 
in eight points: 
  "As [Coexistence Deputy Chairman] Arpad Duka-Zolyomi told 
our 
daily, the agreement provides for the adoption of laws on the 
names of communities and on the writing of family names in a 
form that will be acceptable to the Hungarians. Important 
points concern guarantees of community property and the transfer 
of care of schools and cultural institutions to the jurisdiction 
of community self-administrative bodies. It is necessary to 
halt the organizing of the so-called bilingual alternative 
schools in areas inhabited by ethnic Hungarians. The Hungarian 
parties expect that the process of preparations for territorial 
reorganization will be halted. The new government will also 
prepare the signing of the European Self-Rule Charter and the 
European Regional and Minority Charter. Furthermore, the 
agreement concerns the establishment of minority departments at 
the Ministries of Education and Culture, within the framework of 
which there will be separate Hungarian sections. The 
appointment of state secretaries at the aforementioned 
ministries will have to be coordinated with the Hungarian 
parliamentary parties. Finally, it is necessary to reconsider 
the composition of local state administration bodies in the 
minority regions and take into consideration special 
recommendations from the Hungarian parliamentary parties." 
<H5>  Behind-the-Scenes Scenario for Undermining the Constitution </H5>
  The documents approved at the 8 January rally in Komarno, 
which was organized by the Association of Zitny Ostrov [Rye 
Island; area along the Danube in southern Slovakia inhabited by 
ethnic Hungarians] Towns and Communities, in close cooperation 
with representatives of the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement and Coexistence, uncovered the cards of those ethnic 
politicians. They were also uncovered by a statement made by 
Istvan Pasztor, mayor of Komarno and member of the Coexistence 
leadership, after the rally: "If we do not succeed with this 
government with our demands, we will succeed with another one!" 
Even Sibyl would be pleased [as pubalished]. The Komarno 
documents contain exactly what Arpad Duka-Zolyomi presents as 
points of the agreement with the broad-coalition government. 
The well-written scenario of the executors of Budapest's policy 
in Slovakia is starting to be implemented. Cultural and school 
autonomy, guaranteed by the property of communities, would lead 
in the ethnically mixed regions to actual autonomy, also in view 
of the electoral law, which is based on the majority principle 
regarding elections to self-administrative bodies. 
  The position of the state-forming nation, the Slovaks, in 
southern Slovakia is already alarming, starting with the 
discrimination against Slovak pupils and ending with the 
impossibility for Slovaks to claim their rights with city and 
community councils, which are controlled by [ethnic] Hungarian 
politicians. As can be seen, the Moravcik coalition's craving 
for power is stronger than its responsibility for the fate of 
its own nation and defense of its state interests as enshrined 
in the Constitution. 
  The coming days, when the laws on the names of communities 
and on [birth and marriage] registers and the solution to 
Slovakia's territorial and administrative division will be 
discussed, will show how far the present broad coalition intends 
to go in its concessions to the already privileged Hungarian 
minority! Above-standard rights of minorities have never 
brought anything good in history. 
  By the way, in the last "Kroky" ["Steps"; television panel 
discussion broadcast every Sunday morning], Vojtech Bugar swore 
that no agreement exists between the coalition and the Hungarian 
political entities. Who is actually using lies as a working 
method?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Oldrich Zabojnik: "Doubts Are Growing </F>
Regarding the Customs Union"] 
  [Text] Notions that any kind of Slovak government other 
than that of Meciar would be an easier partner for the Czech 
Republic are proving erroneous in the first month of activity on 
the part of the Moravcik cabinet. While Meciar was frequently a 
partner who was difficult to figure out, given a little 
patience, when it was always necessary to wait awhile before he 
would cool off over a problem, in the end it was generally 
possible to come to agreement with him. That was also made 
simpler by the fact that Meciar's basic disposition is expressly 
political, which makes it possible to find compromises not 
always immediately measurable in terms of money. Although the 
seemingly softer Moravcik does display a willingness to exercise 
more restraint in listening to the views of the Czech partners, 
he unequivocally stresses Slovak commercial and economic 
interests in relationships with the Czech Republic, interests 
which, even in his opinion, are not now being met with equality. 
His economics ministers go still further and openly state that 
they will be more difficult partners for Prague than were their 
Meciar predecessors. 
  Above all, the Moravcik government is currently concerned 
with the customs union which ideologically divides Slovakia into 
its opponents and defenders, the latter of which seem to be 
diminishing with the passage of time. It would appear that the 
number of defenders is diminishing, even despite warnings 
sounded by leading Slovak economists. For example, Prof. Jozef 
Kosnar, who is considered to be the principal economics expert 
at the SDL [expansion unknown], when responding to a question by 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY as to what he thinks of the contribution made 
to Slovakia by the customs union stated: "Elimination of the 
customs union would be a greater economic blow for Slovakia than 
was the elimination of the federation in the political sense." 
However, there are only a few public officials in Bratislava who 
would be willing to publicize such a view. Following the advent 
of the Moravcik government, however, there was an express 
increase in the number of those who publicly made no secret of 
the fact that they consider the customs union as something which 
not only makes no contribution, but as something which even 
harms Slovakia. One of the members of the government who shares 
in formulating the financial policies of the Slovak Republic 
even believes that the very origin of the customs union was a 
mistake for Slovakia. He adds that a small state which is 
beginning its existence should primarily provide opportunities 
for its manufacturers even at the price that their products are 
more expensive and possibly even of a lower quality than 
imported products. 
  Given the growing criticism of the current content of the 
customs union, it is interesting to monitor the Slovak media. 
Even those who had subjected Meciar's economic policies to 
crushing criticism and had favored an understanding with the 
Czech Republic are now stressing the need for a consistent 
approach by Moravcik toward Prague in bringing about "more just 
conditions" for trading for Slovaks with Czechs. The Slovak 
approach in matters of the customs union is visibly 
accelerating. It is passing from those realized technical 
barriers in the image of attestations, certificates, and import 
tariffs toward manifesting demands that changes be effected in 
the clearing accounting procedures as well as in the customs 
union itself. This type of activation which, in Bratislava, is 
already slowly exceeding the limits of a campaign, even has its 
political motivations: Under opposition criticism, Moravcik 
cannot afford to be clearly less of a patriot in the eyes of the 
public prior to the elections. But the matter is primarily more 
pragmatic. The efficiency of the Slovak economy is approximately 
one-third less than that of the Czech Republic and Slovakia must 
come to terms with a lower standard of living than the one it 
was accustomed to in the federation. That finding is leaked to 
the public because no one within the coalition or the opposition 
has the political courage to fully admit it. That is why all 
potential sources that could slow down the currently continuing 
economic failure of the country are being sought out all the 
more tenaciously.

  [Text] Our reporter Zlatina Georgieva has learned that 
National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov has prepared a 
decision on discontinuing the prerogatives of the National 
Assembly on the basis of Article 86, Paragraph 1, and in 
connection with Article 64, Paragraph 3, and Article 98, 
Paragraph 1 of the Bulgarian Constitution. The decision has not 
yet been submitted to the National Assembly office. 
  The decision might sound strange, but legal experts in the 
National Assembly pointed out that according to the 
aforementioned articles the National Assembly could adopt such a 
decision and then adopt a special procedure for setting new 
elections, whose date should be fixed by the president of the 
Republic. 
  According to a member of the Radical Democratic Party, of 
which Yordanov also is a member, Yordanov's motives are related 
to the fact that the National Assembly is not adoptingthe 
important economic bills and is thus blocking reform in the 
country.

parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] 
rejected by a large majority, with four abstentions, the draft 
decision proposed by Edvin Sugarev on the self-dissolution of 
the National Assembly if Professor Berov's cabinet remains in 
power. This draft decision does not conform to the Bulgarian 
Constitution and would deceive the country. This was stated by 
Stefan Savov, chairman of the SDS parliamentary faction, after 
the meeting. 
  The proposal of Aleksandur Yordanov was not discussed 
because 
he withdrew it. Edvin Sugarev described that proposal as a joke.

<F P=106> [Article by Mihaly Bak: "Statement by Arpad Goncz in Encore"] </F>
  [Text] In his statement made to Hungarian Radio's "Encore," 
Arpad Goncz said yesterday that the responsibilities of the 
president of the Republic begin after the elections, when the 
new administration must be set up. The president said that he 
must meet with every powerful political faction, assessing the 
balance of power and determining which could be part of a 
coalition that is capable of governing. Arpad Goncz said that 
the results of Hungary's elections must be respected. 
  The president said that the parties have already said every 
conceivable bad thing about each other and everything 
conceivable good thing about themselves; a kind of flirtation 
dance is going on to determine who could form alliances with 
whom. These attempts must be accepted at face value, said Goncz, 
who thinks that, contrary to 1990, today we are familiar with 
the parties. The president's recommendation to the voters is 
that everyone start from the present situation. Senseless 
slander will come back to haunt those who engage in it, the 
president stated. 
  What the president sees throughout the country is that 
people 
would like to live a life without fear and to see unblemished 
public service. It is the citizens' responsibility not to vote 
for those who are to be feared or those who fail to serve the 
community well. The advancement of unblemished public service 
will most likely be the responsibility of the next parliament. 
  There are two models in Europe. Despite its economic 
accomplishments, the Italian model is dangerous; on the other 
hand, the Austrian or Finnish model is a splendid example of 
reconciliation of interests, Arpad Goncz said. The latter is 
slower but leads to more stable results. No permanent party 
system will develop before 1998 in Hungary, the president 
continued, although people subscribe to three value systems: 
They want national-Christian traditions, freedom, and equality. 
There will only be a change of administrations, not a change of 
regimes. Goncz said that opinions of Hungary abroad have 
deteriorated during the past year; the West has become 
frightened of the conditions in the region, and has also become 
frightened of certain statements and anti-Semitic voices. 
  Everyone should vote and follow his or her conscience, Arpad 
Goncz said. He hopes that none of the parties will try at the 
last moment to forcibly influence voters--not even by merely 
stirring emotions. But he could not promise that such 
occurrences would not happen.

    [Editorial Report] On the eve of the 8 May parliamentary 
election, media supporting the present right-of-center 
government gave unprecedented publicity to charges that Gyula 
Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party 
(MSZP)--successor to the former ruling Communist Party's 
reformist wing--took part in the violent suppression of the 1956 
anti-communist revolution. On 25 April the daily PESTI HIRLAP 
reported that Andras Bencsik, the paper's chief editor and a 
parliamentary candidate of the present governing coalition's 
main party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), said at a 
political rally in Budapest that Horn is "certainly a criminal 
and possibly a murderer." Although "it may not be possible to 
prove" that Horn committed a specific crime, Bencsik said, "he 
was a member of an armed organization that is smeared with 
blood"--evidently referring to rumors, which Horn has not 
denied, that as a young Communist in 1956 he was active in an 
armed militia that fought against the revolutionaries. 
  On 30 April PESTI HIRLAP also ran excerpts from an interview 
that appeared on the television program "Panorama" in which Imre 
Kaldiko, a 1956 revolutionary, charged that in the hospital 
where he was kept prisoner after being wounded during the 
fighting, Horn "kicked him in the mouth twice," doing permanent 
damage. He recognized Horn's photograph after Horn became a 
prominent politician in the Kadar regime, Kaldiko claimed. 
  The other main pro-government daily, UJ MAGYARORSZAG, 
reported on 30 April that the Horn issue had come up at the 
MDF's weekly news conference the day before. At the news 
conference Interior Ministry State Secretary Fabian Jozsa 
speculated that the reason that the MSZP did not name its 
chairman, Horn, as its prime ministerial candidate--the MSZP was 
the only major party to go into the election without naming its 
nominee for prime minister--was that the MSZP was "prepared for 
the attacks" against Horn's "political past." 
  Rumors about Horn's 1956 activities started surfacing a few 
years ago but did not get much publicity even after a letter 
demanding an investigation of his past appeared in the 2 
September 1991 UJ MAGYARORSZAG, which has a relatively small 
circulation. The letter quoted from the January 1990 issue of 
the prominent monthly MOZGO VILAG--published while the 
Communists were still in power--according to which Robert 
Ribanszki, secretary of the official Patriotic People's Front 
under the Kadar regime, allegedly declared that Horn had been 
"merciless" in fighting the revolutionaries. "Gyula was 
relentless. He slashed and shot like a madman," Ribanszki 
reportedly said. 
  Although the MSZP denounced Bencsik's charges as "going 
beyond all normal and acceptable limits" and demanded that the 
MDF withdraw Bencsik's candidacy for parliament (NEPSZABADSAG 26 
Apr 94), Horn announced that he would not sue for libel because 
he "trusted in public opinion to condemn" Bencsik for making the 
allegations (NEPSZABADSAG 27 Apr 94). Horn also attacked the 
"Panorama" television program for airing the charges against 
him, declaring that he had "never been" to any prison hospital 
or even the town where the alleged events occurred. Denouncing 
the program for publicizing "gross lies that hurt my human 
dignity without giving me a chance to answer," Horn said that 
the public service media were guilty of "unprecedented . . . 
abuses" during the election campaign (MAGYAR HIRLAP 2 May 94). 
  In their denunciations and denials, the MSZP did not say 
what 
the actual charges against Horn were, thus limiting further 
publicity. Similarly, while NEPSZABADSAG, which calls itself a 
"socialist daily," and MAGYAR HIRLAP, a paper with a liberal 
orientation, published the MSZP's statements, they did not 
detail the allegations against Horn and thus refrained from 
publicizing the charges against him.

<F P=106> [Interview with political scientist Istvan Schlett by an </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "Schlett 
Says: The Political Elite Will Solve Any Conflict"] 
  [Text] The intelligentsia constantly clobbers the 
politicians. You journalists do that also, even though the 
political elite's demonstrated ability to solve problems could 
serve as an example for other elites, e.g., the cultural elite, 
said political scientist Istvan Schlett. The renowned expert 
said that, on the basis of the past four years, we can assume 
that, regardless of the outcome of the elections, the parties 
will be able to solve the problem of setting up an 
administration and of governing. 
  You are telling me to imagine the unimaginable: Gabor Kuncze 
and Peter Boross sitting at the same table and discussing the 
possibility of forming a coalition. Well, that too could happen. 
The Hungarian political elite is cultured enough to be able to 
solve a deadlock, Schlett continued. 
  [Schlett] I do not think parliament will have to be 
dissolved and new elections called because of the leading 
parties' inability to agree on the conditions for governing. The 
fact that the Free Democrats' nominee for the post of prime 
minister is not a person with a "bunker mentality," but one who 
represents a more open aspect of the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free 
Democrats], is an indication of their willingness to compromise. 
The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] has also gotten rid of 
those whose main objective was to create conflicts. 
  I think that the parties are ready for further changes in 
their leadership. Of course, I cannot see what is inside the 
heads of politicians, and the opposite of this is also 
conceivable. At any rate, it can be said on the basis of recent 
events that they are more intelligent than is generally assumed. 
  [MAGYAR NEMZET] You are reluctant to make a guess about 
which 
parties are likely to become coalition partners. I will rephrase 
the question, therefore, by asking which parties are likely to 
win seats in parliament? 
  [Schlett] Forecasts suggest that the MSZP [Hungarian 
Socialist Party] will win the elections. However, no one indeed 
can say which party will come in second and third. The number of 
undecided people is relatively great and it remains to be seen 
whom they will vote for. This in itself may be cause for 
surprises at the elections. 
  [MAGYAR NEMZET] What if parties of diametrically opposing 
ideals get most of the votes, e.g. the MDF, the MSZP, and the 
SZDSZ? Can you imagine them sitting at the same table and 
beginning talks on governing? The statements they have made so 
far exclude any possibility of a consensus between them. Do they 
not lose their credibility before the voters by their 
willingness to accept any deal for gaining power? 
  [Schlett] You approach the issue from the wrong direction. 
Credibility is indeed important in politics but the capacity to 
solve problems is even more important. It is natural for parties 
to compete against each other during an election campaign, for 
they are fighting for votes. However, finding compromises 
becomes a priority after the elections because the country's 
governability is at stake. Politics has a much more extensive 
arsenal than merely classifying parties on the basis of their 
credibility or lack thereof or of whether or not they fulfill 
their campaign promises. The citizens expect politicians to 
solve conflicts. In the interest of society, of our country, of 
joining Europe and, of course, in the self-interest of parties 
and politicians, they must adapt their viewpoints to one 
another. Of course, the voters will determine the possible 
combinations for a coalition, but I do not believe that a 
situation will arise where the politicians will fail to find a 
viable solution. 
  [MAGYAR NEMZET] Is it possible that the situation will 
change 
between the two rounds? 
  [Schlett] Of course. It could happen that the winner of the 
first round will increase its advantage, for people do not like 
to vote for a losing party. But the opposite could also happen, 
namely, that a party will gain such a landslide victory that 
people will become scared and say: This is too much of a 
victory. Perhaps several parties will form totally unexpected 
alliances to hinder an absolute victory by a leading party.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon the members of the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] Central Executive Bureau held 
a meeting, at their request, with President Ion Iliescu to 
examine the current political situation and the role to be 
played by the PDSR, as the government party, to solve the 
political, economic, and social problems facing Romania. 
  According to a communique sent to us, the members of the 
PDSR's Central Executive Bureau do not consider that there is 
currently a political crisis in Romania, and the activity of the 
institutions of the law-governed state is taking place in 
conformity with the Constitution and the laws of the country. 
In this context they acknowledged the efforts made by President 
Iliescu to establish a climate favorable for the internal and 
international stability of the country. 
  The second part of the meeting was devoted to the 
examination 
of certain issues related to the PDSR's current preoccupations, 
both at the central and local levels, the activity of its 
factions in both houses of Parliament, and relations with the 
parties supporting Nicolae Vacaroiu's cabinet and with the other 
parliamentary political parties. 
  The PDSR communique emphasizes that the Central Executive 
Bureau has found that lately the attacks intensified against the 
party and its top leadership, and especially against PDSR 
Executive Chairman Adrian Nastase. According to the communique, 
the members of the PDSR Central Executive Bureau reject, quote, 
such demolition tactics that are not foreign to certain forces 
of the opposition, unquote. 
  The PDSR Central Executive Bureau has decided that coherent 
and firm actions should be initiated at all levels against 
corruption and the phenomenon of infraction, to rebuild the 
population's confidence in the authorities of the law-governed 
state, says the PDSR communique signed by PDSR Deputy Chairman 
Ion Solcanu.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Pirro Dishnica by Golik </F>
Trebeshina; place and date not given: "Advantages for Foreign 
Investments"] 
  [Excerpts] [Trebeshina] What was the economic situation 
inherited by Albania and what are the aims of the democratic 
government in expanding economic reforms in the country? 
  [Dishnica] [passage omitted] When the democratic government 
came into power in April 1992, an overall program was undertaken 
to implement a policy of transition to the market economy. The 
government put its entire intellectual arsenal into implementing 
this program and we are all witnesses to the noticeable economic 
successes of the government: the fight against inflation, the 
continuing efforts to control the budget deficit by means of a 
rigorous policy on expenditures, and the presentation of a tax 
system based on the market economy, restrictions on bank loans, 
bank interest rates based on the rules of the market, and the 
restoration of confidence in the country's monetary unit. It 
should be stressed that in the implementation of this program, 
considerable financial assistance was obtained from abroad, such 
as the "standby" agreement with the IMF. After the successful 
implemention of this agreement, it became possible to sign a 
medium-term agreement (ESAF) with the IMF in July 1993, for 
assistance in the medium-term program of economic reform. There 
was also the World Bank loan for critical imports and the EC 
support for the balance of payments. 
  At the same time, a number of foreign countries provided 
food 
assistance and humanitarian aid and carried out development and 
technical assistance projects, in particular Italy, the United 
States, Germany, Turkey, and other G-24 countries. [passage 
omitted] 
  The government's budget deficit decreased from 40 percent of 
the GDP at the beginning of the economic stabilization program 
in the first half of 1992 to less than 10 percent in the first 
half of 1993. These favorable results were achieved by 
implementing tight control over expenditures. Even though the 
budget deficit is still high, the results so far show that the 
process of reducing the budget deficit continues. 
  Since 1992 the external debt of Albania has been less than 
planned due to fewer imports and improvements in exports. 
Exports are expected to be 25 percent higher in 1993 than in 
1992. There were shortfalls and delays in medium-term and 
long-term financing but they were partially compensated for by 
private transfers of funds and the receipt of more capital than 
was planned. Another positive development is the inclusion of 
the private sector in foreign trade. Currently the private 
sector dominates imports and plays a big role in exports. In 
this framework, noticeable progress has been made in the 
implementation of the price policy and the reduction of 
budgetary subsidies. In general, retail and wholesale prices 
have been liberalized. The policy of increasing prices is aimed 
at reducing the obstacles to increasing production and imports. 
  [Trebeshina] What are the developmental parameters of the 
Albanian government's economic program? 
  [Dishnica] Our data indicates that production has stopped 
decreasing and that there are signs of an increase. In 
particular, agriculture has shown noticeable signs of 
improvement in response to price reform and privatization. After 
the privatization of cooperatives and the liberalization of 
prices of food products, the attention of the government has 
been concentrated on the privatization and restructuring of 
state farms, the completion of the price reform for agricultural 
products, the rehabilitation of the rural infrastructure, and 
the privatization of distribution and processing enterprises. 
The World Bank and other donors are close collaborators in the 
execution of this reform. The privatization and restructuring of 
state farms and the raising of the prices of agricultural inputs 
up to the level of imports are priority targets. It should be 
stressed that the measures to transform the Agriculture and 
Development Bank into a new institution, completely subject to 
the law on banks, are of special importance for the role which 
this bank will play in providing support for the new structures 
in agriculture. In the government's program, the infrastructure 
has remained within the financial limitations on the basis of 
the general opinion that the largest part of the public 
infrastructure of Albania is inadequate for the development of a 
modern economy and for attracting investments in various 
branches of the economy. 
  Although the transportation system has been evaluated as 
adequate, on the whole it is far from meeting the essential 
quality parameters and conditions have become so bad that 
economic development is hindered. The government is placing a 
priority on repairing the main highways and expanding roads in 
the mountainous areas, reconstructing the port of Durres and the 
Rinas Airport, and, in particular, constructing international 
highways such as the Durres-Skopje-Sofia highway with a branch 
leading to Kapshtice or Durres-Kakavije. I would like to add 
here that a positive sign of the rapid development of the 
transportation sector is the predominance of private 
transporters in interurban transportation and international 
transportation of passengers and goods. 
  The telecommunications infrastructure in Albania is very 
limited. In the framework of the master plan, for the execution 
of a $30-million program financed by the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development and by Italy, Switzerland, and 
Austria, there will be restructuring; it is thought that 
resources will be found for the rapid installation of modern 
telecommunications systems, which is an essential condition for 
attracting investors and tourists. 
  There has been noticeable improvement in the construction 
field, both in the villages and in the cities. Private 
investments by individuals are predominant in this area. To 
eliminate the lack of housing and to improve the quality of 
existing housing, the government has aimed at increasing the 
role of the private sector and improving the costs. A law aiming 
at the rapid privatization of the inventory of housing units has 
been passed and is being implemented. To provide incentive for 
the private construction of housing, rents for newly constructed 
housing units have been liberalized. Work has resumed on the 
completion of the construction of apartments which were being 
built. By the end of September 1993, some 1,451 apartments were 
completed and handed over for use. During the same period, 
investments of more than 713,000 leks were made. Some 8,401 
housing units and 24,090 economic units have been built by 
private concerns and many others are in the process of 
construction. 
  The privatization program aims at increasing private 
activity 
in two directions: 
  a. the creation of private enterprise activities in the 
entire economy, without any restrictions, and 
  b. the privatization of state property. 
  To accelerate the process of privatization within the 
strategic framework, the law on privatization has been reviewed, 
there have been reorganizations of structures directly concerned 
with privatization, and an incentive-providing fiscal policy has 
been implemented. The enactment of the laws on the bankruptcy of 
enterprises and on the return and compensation of owners are 
expected to have a positive influence in this area. Despite the 
objective difficulties which have appeared, all efforts are 
being made to provide compensation as soon as possible by means 
of bonds and to create opportunities for bondholders to take 
part in the privatization process. 
  [Trebeshina] How does the legal system create an appropriate 
climate for the economic development of Albania and, in this 
context, how does it provide guarantees for foreign investors? 
  [Dishnica] The legislative system for the market economy is 
rapidly being created. During the past year, the parliament 
approved the law on commercial companies, a banking law, a law 
on the Bank of Albania, a law on bankruptcy, the law on 
accounting, as well as labor legislation. Finally, we have 
approved a liberal law on foreign investments which facilitates 
registration procedures. The main thing is that any 
disagreements will always be resolved by international law. Laws 
on taxes and customs have been rewritten so that they are fully 
suited to the market economy. The increase in investments by 
borrowing foreign capital is one of the most important actions 
for putting the economy back on its feet. Despite the problems 
which have appeared, foreign firms and investors have had an 
increasing interest in Albania. Firms with a total investment of 
about $50 million, part of $100 million in contracts, have 
signed contracts and begun their activities. Other firms have 
concluded contracts for a total investment of $70 million and 
are expected to begin their activity. 
  The government is constantly trying to create an attractive 
atmosphere for foreign investments. In the foreign investment 
law, foreign investments and investors are treated the same as 
Albanians. In addition, foreign investors are not subject to 
controls over capital and are free to transfer their profits. 
Soon all investors who invest in the production sector will not 
have to pay taxes for a four-year period and this period will be 
extended for those firms which reinvest and for those firms 
which invest in the tourismn sector. In addition, investors will 
profit from liberal exemptions from customs taxes for goods 
which are used in the investment creation process. At present, 
foreigners can rent land for 99 years at a reasonable price and, 
for some projects, they can buy land. The foreign investment law 
stipulates that disagreements connected with expropriation or 
compensation for expropriation or discrimination will be 
resolved by international bodies such as the International 
Center for the Resolution of Investment Conflicts. Another more 
important point is the exemption from procedures for seeking 
authorization to make an investment, procedures which still 
exist, even today, in some Eastern European countries, such as 
Romania, Poland, and others. I am convinced that the approval of 
the civil code which will permit private ownership of the land 
and the rights which result from this ownership will give a new 
incentive to foreign investors to come to Albania. 
  In conclusion, I would like to say that many bilateral 
investments and tax agreements have been signed by our 
government to facilitate foreign investments, with all those 
countries whose investors have or will have an interest in 
investing in Albania.

<F P=106> [Article by the press spokesman of the Ministry of Industry, </F>
Mining, and Energy Sources: "The Chrome Industry Has Prospects 
for Development in the Market Economy"] 
  [Text] Representatives of the Independent Trade Union of 
Miners in Albania, led by Asllan Myshku; the trade union of the 
chrome corporation, led by Sabah Pata; the "Albkrom" 
corporation; and the Ministry of Labor, Emigration, and Social 
Assistance, along with the deputy minister of industry, mining, 
and energy resources, Albert Brokaj, have held a meeting in 
Bulqize, in the largest mining center of the chrome extraction 
and processing industry. 
  During this meeting representatives of these trade unions, 
which belong to the Union of Independent Trade Unions of 
Albania, led by President Valer Xheka, brought up some important 
issues related to the collective labor contract, which they said 
was signed in a unilateral manner. They also raised issues 
related to production, the opening up of new jobs, the financing 
of new projects dealing with the development and future of the 
chrome extraction and processing industry, the urgent need to 
update technology, the creation of a joint enterprise, and 
possibilities for privatization. They wanted to know why workers 
in the corporation have not received 20-percent wage increases 
in accordance with the government decision. They were concerned 
about the sale of chrome, chrome concentrate, and ferrochrome, 
about the consequences of the embargo [against Yugoslavia] in 
the chrome extraction and processing industry and about the 
satisfaction, as soon as possible, of demands for housing and 
for the improvement of the miners' living and working 
conditions. 
  The participants in the meeting raised a number of other 
issues regarding the organization and management of work in the 
corporation and stressed the need for a bitter struggle against 
possible signs of corruption and for the further improvement of 
social assistance. 
  In their response, Deputy Minister Brokaj and the 
representatives of "Albkrom" and the Ministry of Labor, 
Emigration, and Social Assistance said that the government has 
drawn up a strategy for the chrome industry, which is a valuable 
national asset, and, therefore, the government has demonstrated 
and will continue to demonstrate concern for its continued 
development. It was pointed out that this corporation has had a 
higher hard currency income than any other corporation or 
production unit in the country and that the greater part of this 
income is used for the needs of the corporation. There are good 
possibilities for increasing this income. 
  It was stressed that the ministry must seek compensation 
from 
the United Nations for the serious consequences which this 
industry has suffered in the northeastern part of the country 
because of the embargo. At the end of the meeting the trade 
unions strongly stressed that a resolution containing the 
following demands should be issued: 
  -- the collective contracts should be re-signed, with the 
participation of all the trade unions, especially the trade 
union of the corporation, which represents about 46 percent of 
the employees; 
  -- the financial situation of the corporation should be 
improved by forgiving the taxes for 1992 and 1993; 
  -- workers should receive a 26-percent wage increase; 
  -- negotiations for the creation of a joint enterprise 
should 
be accelerated; 
  -- additional funds should be sought from the government for 
the construction of the Klosi traverse bank, the ramp, and shaft 
No. 7, which are linked to the future of the mining industry; 
  -- the price of energy for the chrome corporation, the 
largest consumer of energy, should be reduced; 
  -- the headquarters of the corporation should be transferred 
to Bulqize and the retirement age for certain categories of 
workers should be lowered. 
  The demands in this resolution will be presented to the 
government. It was decided that the collective contract would be 
re-signed on 15 April 1994 at the corporation's headquarters in 
Tirana.

<F P=106> ["Resolution of the National Council of the Albanian </F>
Republican Party"] 
  [Text] The National Council of the Albanian Republican 
Party, held on 8 April 1994, reviewed the activity of the 
steering committee in connection with the political situation in 
the country and some aspects of economic development. After much 
open discussion, the Council reached the following conclusions: 
  1. Political tensions have increased as a result of the 
abstractionism of the Socialist Party, clothed in the garments 
of renewal, and the abstractionism of its allies. Communism is 
still present in Albania. The "renewal" of the Socialists, 
imposed by time, is demagogy. 
  2. The efforts to bring the country out of the crisis have 
produced some good results with the general orientation to the 
free market but the optimal solution has not yet been achieved. 
The optimal solution can be achieved only by means of the 
republican program, which is based on the recognition and return 
of private property and, especially, ownership of the land. 
  3. The party in power, which has the heavy burden of 
governing the country, is continuing to develop a tendency to 
monopolize administrative leadership and political life, with a 
restraining effect on the development of democracy and the 
effective use of intellectual potential. This has paved the way 
for left-wing phenomena and recidivist elements from the past. 
  4. Corruption has taken on alarming proportions for the 
present and future of the country. Efforts to combat these 
manifestations, especially in the area of privatization, have 
been ineffective. 
  5. The Republican Party provided all types of assistance to 
the alliance of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and 
the Social Democratic Party, an alliance which was created at 
the time of the struggle for the overthrow of the communist 
government, and regarded this alliance as a compass for 
democratic developments. Under the present conditions, there is 
no hope that this alliance can be repeated. The Republican Party 
is in favor of cooperation with the Democratic Party if this 
party creates true conditions for real and sincere cooperation. 
  6. Keeping in mind the country's great interest in internal 
stability and foreign credibility, the Republican Party supports 
the government coalition, which guarantees general democratic 
developments. This does not prevent the Republican Party from 
freely stating its opinions and providing constructive 
opposition on all matters which are not in accord with its 
program. 
  7. The National Council is convinced that the creation of a 
right wing in Albania is necessary today because: 
  -- the right wing will be an effective counterbalance to the 
unproclaimed alliance of the left-wing forces which, under 
various labels and slogans, are aiming to reestablish the 
socialist form of government. 
  -- only the right wing can carry out free capitalist 
development, beginning with the recognition and return of legal 
ownership. 
  -- under current political conditions, only the right wing 
can represent a true democratic opposition. 
  -- during the past year, in particular, the foreign policy 
of 
the Albanian state in the defense of the country has followed a 
correct line. However, this policy will receive the necessary 
strength through coordination with the right wing's clear ideas 
on the country. 
  The leadership of the party is charged with engaging in 
discussions with right-wing political parties and associations 
to formulate joint guidelines and action plans on the basis of 
political reality and national interests. 
  8. The Republican Party will increase its struggle, in an 
effective manner, for the return of property and, first, for the 
enactment of a just land law. The republican concept of 
ownership must be extended over the entire economic spectrum. At 
the same time, the Republican Party must anticipate the problems 
resulting from capitalist development. 
  9. The Republican Party will work with perseverance to 
attract intellectuals into its ranks and management. The party's 
central headquarters and the party press are being reorganized 
and oriented on the basis of the guidelines in this resolution. 
  10. The membership of Arben Babameto, Arben Brace, Arsen 
Proko, Durim Kulli, and Neritan Alibali on the party's steering 
committee is approved.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Pirro Dishnica by Golik </F>
Trebeshina; place and date not given: "Advantages for Foreign 
Investments"] 
  [Excerpts] [Trebeshina] What was the economic situation 
inherited by Albania and what are the aims of the democratic 
government in expanding economic reforms in the country? 
  [Dishnica] [passage omitted] When the democratic government 
came into power in April 1992, an overall program was undertaken 
to implement a policy of transition to the market economy. The 
government put its entire intellectual arsenal into implementing 
this program and we are all witnesses to the noticeable economic 
successes of the government: the fight against inflation, the 
continuing efforts to control the budget deficit by means of a 
rigorous policy on expenditures, and the presentation of a tax 
system based on the market economy, restrictions on bank loans, 
bank interest rates based on the rules of the market, and the 
restoration of confidence in the country's monetary unit. It 
should be stressed that in the implementation of this program, 
considerable financial assistance was obtained from abroad, such 
as the "standby" agreement with the IMF. After the successful 
implemention of this agreement, it became possible to sign a 
medium-term agreement (ESAF) with the IMF in July 1993, for 
assistance in the medium-term program of economic reform. There 
was also the World Bank loan for critical imports and the EC 
support for the balance of payments. 
  At the same time, a number of foreign countries provided 
food 
assistance and humanitarian aid and carried out development and 
technical assistance projects, in particular Italy, the United 
States, Germany, Turkey, and other G-24 countries. [passage 
omitted] 
  The government's budget deficit decreased from 40 percent of 
the GDP at the beginning of the economic stabilization program 
in the first half of 1992 to less than 10 percent in the first 
half of 1993. These favorable results were achieved by 
implementing tight control over expenditures. Even though the 
budget deficit is still high, the results so far show that the 
process of reducing the budget deficit continues. 
  Since 1992 the external debt of Albania has been less than 
planned due to fewer imports and improvements in exports. 
Exports are expected to be 25 percent higher in 1993 than in 
1992. There were shortfalls and delays in medium-term and 
long-term financing but they were partially compensated for by 
private transfers of funds and the receipt of more capital than 
was planned. Another positive development is the inclusion of 
the private sector in foreign trade. Currently the private 
sector dominates imports and plays a big role in exports. In 
this framework, noticeable progress has been made in the 
implementation of the price policy and the reduction of 
budgetary subsidies. In general, retail and wholesale prices 
have been liberalized. The policy of increasing prices is aimed 
at reducing the obstacles to increasing production and imports. 
  [Trebeshina] What are the developmental parameters of the 
Albanian government's economic program? 
  [Dishnica] Our data indicates that production has stopped 
decreasing and that there are signs of an increase. In 
particular, agriculture has shown noticeable signs of 
improvement in response to price reform and privatization. After 
the privatization of cooperatives and the liberalization of 
prices of food products, the attention of the government has 
been concentrated on the privatization and restructuring of 
state farms, the completion of the price reform for agricultural 
products, the rehabilitation of the rural infrastructure, and 
the privatization of distribution and processing enterprises. 
The World Bank and other donors are close collaborators in the 
execution of this reform. The privatization and restructuring of 
state farms and the raising of the prices of agricultural inputs 
up to the level of imports are priority targets. It should be 
stressed that the measures to transform the Agriculture and 
Development Bank into a new institution, completely subject to 
the law on banks, are of special importance for the role which 
this bank will play in providing support for the new structures 
in agriculture. In the government's program, the infrastructure 
has remained within the financial limitations on the basis of 
the general opinion that the largest part of the public 
infrastructure of Albania is inadequate for the development of a 
modern economy and for attracting investments in various 
branches of the economy. 
  Although the transportation system has been evaluated as 
adequate, on the whole it is far from meeting the essential 
quality parameters and conditions have become so bad that 
economic development is hindered. The government is placing a 
priority on repairing the main highways and expanding roads in 
the mountainous areas, reconstructing the port of Durres and the 
Rinas Airport, and, in particular, constructing international 
highways such as the Durres-Skopje-Sofia highway with a branch 
leading to Kapshtice or Durres-Kakavije. I would like to add 
here that a positive sign of the rapid development of the 
transportation sector is the predominance of private 
transporters in interurban transportation and international 
transportation of passengers and goods. 
  The telecommunications infrastructure in Albania is very 
limited. In the framework of the master plan, for the execution 
of a $30-million program financed by the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development and by Italy, Switzerland, and 
Austria, there will be restructuring; it is thought that

attracting investors and tourists.

<F P=106> [Article by the press spokesman of the Ministry of Industry, </F>
Mining, and Energy Sources: "The Chrome Industry Has Prospects 
for Development in the Market Economy"] 
  [Text] Representatives of the Independent Trade Union of 
Miners in Albania, led by Asllan Myshku; the trade union of the 
chrome corporation, led by Sabah Pata; the "Albkrom" 
corporation; and the Ministry of Labor, Emigration, and Social 
Assistance, along with the deputy minister of industry, mining, 
and energy resources, Albert Brokaj, have held a meeting in 
Bulqize, in the largest mining center of the chrome extraction 
and processing industry. 
  During this meeting representatives of these trade unions, 
which belong to the Union of Independent Trade Unions of 
Albania, led by President Valer Xheka, brought up some important 
issues related to the collective labor contract, which they said 
was signed in a unilateral manner. They also raised issues 
related to production, the opening up of new jobs, the financing 
of new projects dealing with the development and future of the 
chrome extraction and processing industry, the urgent need to 
update technology, the creation of a joint enterprise, and 
possibilities for privatization. They wanted to know why workers 
in the corporation have not received 20-percent wage increases 
in accordance with the government decision. They were concerned 
about the sale of chrome, chrome concentrate, and ferrochrome, 
about the consequences of the embargo [against Yugoslavia] in 
the chrome extraction and processing industry and about the 
satisfaction, as soon as possible, of demands for housing and 
for the improvement of the miners' living and working 
conditions. 
  The participants in the meeting raised a number of other 
issues regarding the organization and management of work in the 
corporation and stressed the need for a bitter struggle against 
possible signs of corruption and for the further improvement of 
social assistance. 
  In their response, Deputy Minister Brokaj and the 
representatives of "Albkrom" and the Ministry of Labor, 
Emigration, and Social Assistance said that the government has 
drawn up a strategy for the chrome industry, which is a valuable 
national asset, and, therefore, the government has demonstrated 
and will continue to demonstrate concern for its continued 
development. It was pointed out that this corporation has had a 
higher hard currency income than any other corporation or 
production unit in the country and that the greater part of this 
income is used for the needs of the corporation. There are good 
possibilities for increasing this income. 
  It was stressed that the ministry must seek compensation 
from 
the United Nations for the serious consequences which this 
industry has suffered in the northeastern part of the country 
because of the embargo. At the end of the meeting the trade 
unions strongly stressed that a resolution containing the 
following demands should be issued: 
  -- the collective contracts should be re-signed, with the 
participation of all the trade unions, especially the trade 
union of the corporation, which represents about 46 percent of 
the employees; 
  -- the financial situation of the corporation should be 
improved by forgiving the taxes for 1992 and 1993; 
  -- workers should receive a 26-percent wage increase; 
  -- negotiations for the creation of a joint enterprise 
should 
be accelerated; 
  -- additional funds should be sought from the government for 
the construction of the Klosi traverse bank, the ramp, and shaft 
No. 7, which are linked to the future of the mining industry; 
  -- the price of energy for the chrome corporation, the 
largest consumer of energy, should be reduced; 
  -- the headquarters of the corporation should be transferred 
to Bulqize and the retirement age for certain categories of 
workers should be lowered. 
  The demands in this resolution will be presented to the 
government. It was decided that the collective contract would be 
re-signed on 15 April 1994 at the corporation's headquarters in 
Tirana.

  [Text] Warsaw, 13 May (PAP)--The government will definitely 
adhere to agreements concluded with hard coal and lignite-mine 
workers, said Trade and Industry Minister Marek Pol, while 
delivering a government report on the strike situation and the 
results of negotiations with trade unions in the Sejm today. 
  "There has not been a single day without strike since this 
government took office. Most strikes do not meet the 
requirements of legality, but we recognize this method of 
protest. Strikes are always dangerous. This one, however, was 
particularly dangerous because it affected strategic sectors, 
crucial to the security of the state. We are aware that trade 
unions are not rich, but, all over the world, financial 
compensation for strikes is paid by the organizer," Minister Pol 
said. 
  According to Pol, the strikes in the lignite-mining industry 
were caused by anxiety over the sector's restructuring. The 
protest in the hard coal mining industry was initially linked to 
support for lignite-mine workers and later became a 
manifestation of support for Solidarity's demands on the 
national scale. 
  Pol believes that mine workers should elect their 
representation; there are from several to a dozen or so trade 
union organizations in each colliery. For example, in the hard 
coal mining industry, there are 39 trade union organizations. 
  The minister briefed the deputies on the content of 
agreements concluded with lignite-mine workers on 30 April in 
Konin and with hard-coal mine workers on 11 May in Warsaw.

<F P=106> [Article by Marek F. Klimek: "Dangerous Union; Marian </F>
Krzaklewski Says: I Know People Take Part in Strikes...."] 
  [Text] "Really, you do not need to persuade people too 
hard to get them to strike," Piotr Zak, Solidarity National 
Commission spokesman, insists. "The authorities refuse to 
recognize the truth that social discontent does exist in real 
life and is not something our union has conjured up." 
  For two weeks now, strike action organized by the NSZZ 
[Independent and Self-Financing Trade Union] Solidarity has been 
carried out on a nationwide scale. To date, no other major 
central union (except for Kontra, which, as its very name 
suggests, can probably be expected to endorse all protest 
actions) has come out in support. 
<H5>  "Society Will Pay" </H5>
  "We are definitely against strikes because their political 
objectives are hard to conceal. Solidarity leadership has 
launched yet another attempt to impose its political will on 
enterprise work forces on the pretext of defending their 
interests, but, in fact, it is society that will pay for the 
present strikes--and not for the first time, either," the Mining 
Industry's Trade Unions Confederation, which groups all of the 
major miners' unions outside Solidarity, declares in an official 
announcement. "I know that people are taking part in strikes," 
Solidarity chairman Marian Krzaklewski attempts to explain. "It 
must be that there is not sufficient control between the central 
union administration and union members here." 
  Solidarity, led by Krzaklewski, has put all of its money on 
one horse in organizing the nationwide strike action. Chairman 
Krzaklewski has been touring the country attempting to incite 
people to strike or to fan the flames of those strikes that have 
already been started. It seems, however, that his efforts are 
not particularly effective. Whereas on the first day the strike 
organizers were successful in stopping the work of more than 
1,000 enterprises, the second day brought only half that number, 
and, during the following days, only a dozen or so work places 
were still going on with the protest action. 
  The number of striking coal mines has also remained 
constant. 
They are for the most part quite weak enterprises, some of which 
are even destined to be liquidated. Despite vigorous attempts 
by the Solidarity Silesia-Dabrowa Regional Board, coal mines 
belonging to the most powerful Katowice Coal Holding concern 
have resisted invitations to join the strike and stop 
production. Yesterday's attempts to start a railroad strike 
proved that people nowadays are beginning to think of the 
consequences before stopping work. 
  In many enterprises, the strike is carried out in a purely 
symbolic manner. For example, at the Defuma plant in Dabrowa 
Gornicza, which is the only enterprise in Silesia apart from the 
coal mines to have joined the strike, the protest action lasted 
all of two hours, while the organizers cheerfully declared that 
they would soon make up for the stoppage. At the Czeczott coal 
mine, all 22 strikers--that is, less than 1 percent of the crew 
working the first shift--gathered at the mine's Solidarity 
headquarters and, after assessing the situation, returned 
promptly to work. At the Piast coal mine, the strike was 
limited to the mechanical coal-processing plant, which 
nevertheless stopped the work of the whole mine because the coal 
extracted underground was not taken up to the surface. 

<H5>    Will We Have Another Panama? </H5>
  The demands announced by Solidarity cannot be met quickly, 
and some of them are even impossible to implement in practical 
terms. For example, Chairman Krzaklewski interprets the demand 
to "enfranchise all society" as follows: "The government 
oligarchy intends to share the privatized enterprises among 
themselves. We will have a similar situation to the one they had 
in Panama, where 20,000 people took over 70 percent of the 
national assets. But, if you hang on to your privatization bonds 
and pool them, you will be able to outbid any red capitalist!" 
That was a fragment of Krzaklewski's rousing address to the 
striking miners at the Jastrzebie coal mine, who greeted it with 
tumultuous applause. 
  "Now we can appreciate the importance of studying psychology 
and sociology in relation to the sphere of ownership 
transformations, and the significance of cooperation between 
specialists in these fields and experts in economic 
restructuring," Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol remarked 
after signing the agreement that led to the miners' ending their 
10-day strike. 
  "The government has been familiar with the union's demands 
for a long time," Piotr Zak insists, "at the very least since 
the end of the experts' talks on 26 March, when eight demands 
were officially recorded at the Council of Ministers Office 
[URM] and entered, neatly and perfectly legibly, into the URM 
computer. I personally checked it as it was being done. I 
believe that ministers have had more than enough time to 
acquaint themselves with the document." 
  Zak's own declarations can dispel anyone's illusions about 
Solidarity's long-term aims. "I was amused to hear Minister 
Miller claim that parliament is working on a pact. A similar 
situation in the recent past led, among other things, to the 
collapse of Hanna Suchocka's government, and now another 
government, which has been in office for seven months already, 
claims that it needs still more time." 
<H5>  To Regain Lost Positions </H5>
  The union's decisionmakers, who still remember the old 
left-wing government's traditional inclination to be severe and 
tough in its treatment of strikes and strikers, are trying to 
recapture the remains of the ethos of the great strike wave of 
the 1980's and thereby regain their positions as public leaders. 
  After all, on the other side of the barricades, they no 
longer have a poor but honest government hailing from the 
"polystyrene" era [reference to striking shipyard workers 
sleeping on blocks of polystyrene during the Gdansk shipyard 
occupation in 1980], but the much-hated postcommunists, who 
batten on the working men's misery. It is true that they were 
elected in a democratic process, but they still represent the 
last chance for Solidarity as the latter continues to lose its 
membership and its influence because, if Solidarity fails to 
successfully "galvanize" the country against the present 
government team, the ones that follow it will easily withstand 
every future protest action.

  [Text] Warsaw, 12 May--Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski presented the main directions and principles of 
Poland's activity in the international arena in the Sejm today. 
Here are the most important themes of the speech: 
  The treaty with the Republic of Lithuania signed by 
President 
Lech Walesa closed a fundamental stage of Polish foreign policy 
devoted to establishing the foundations for partnership 
relations with neighbors and to defining the strategic goals of 
the foreign policy of the sovereign Polish Republic. We can be 
satisfied with the results achieved. There are no foreign 
troops in Poland--a rare fact in the history of the past 300 
years. We are the only country under transformation that has 
concluded treaties on good-neighborly cooperation with all of 
our neighbors. (...) 
  Poland is also a country of agreement between all serious 
political forces and in public opinion on the basic goals of 
foreign policy. We owe appreciation to the authors of these 
important achievements, in particular to my predecessor, 
Professor Krzysztof Skubiszewski. We are building our place in 
the world on the solid foundations created by them. 
  It is worth recalling the guiding principles of our foreign 
policy. The efforts of our diplomacy focus on activities 
serving people and the good of individuals. There is clarity in 
the policy and of the concrete actions taken within its 
framework. The government has no monopoly on activity abroad, 
and neither has the state. (All centers of power--the 
president, the government, and parliament--take part in its 
creation and implementation. The openness of our state and 
society makes politicians, self-government activists, and 
ordinary citizens participate every day in this activity.) 
  The policy, determined in a normal democratic process--that 
is, with the participation of the parties--is implemented in a 
supraparty manner (we require diplomats to represent the state 
and its goals and not give party interests or personal views). 
Foreign policy, as any other, has to be coherent (it means, 
among other things, the need for close coordination of actions 
by various state bodies and institutions). Our policy strictly 
observes modern international standards, in particular the 
respect for identity, aspirations, and views of other states. 
We are conducting a friendly policy, well-disposed to everybody 
who does the same. 
  The most important task of our foreign policy is to ensure 
lasting security for Poland. We are doing so by developing good 
relations with all of our neighbors and by rapprochement with 
Euro- Atlantic security structures. 
  Every day we are hosting in Poland, legally and illegally, 
hundreds of thousands of Russian, Ukrainian, and other seasonal 
workers, tradesmen, and tourists. They argue with Poles about 
wages, prices, and the quality of goods. Despite such great 
movements of people, we have not noted any incidents aimed at 
Russia. Miracle? Yes, it is a miracle of normality. I am 
convinced that, at the basis of this peaceful atmosphere in 
human relations, there is a feeling among Poles that now they 
are hosts in their own country, and, as such, they are able to 
welcome all guests, including those who only recently symbolized 
imperial violence and dictatorship. (...) 
  By increasing contacts and proposals of joint practical 
actions, we are telling all of our neighbors: We are ready to 
become friends, we are aiming at being related by a net of 
agreements and projects that will ensure the free movement of 
people, information, goods, services, and capital. (...) 
  Poland and Germany are good neighbors. We are looking with 
confidence at democratic and European Germany. This 
good-neighborliness should transform into a friendship. A firm 
friendship is still the aim. If we are to have any mission, 
this should be it because friendship between Poles and Germans 
will mean that an important source of potential conflict in 
Europe will be eliminated. This is a course worth pursuing. 
  We see the path to friendship in uniting Poles and Germans 
in 
the same commonwealth of nations, in the European Union [EU], 
and in making us partners in joint projects, similar to 
French-German reconciliation. This aim dominates our political 
dialogue. A particular form of this is the Paris-Bonn-Warsaw 
cooperation, the so-called Weimar triangle. We are placing a 
great deal of importance in developing this cooperation by 
intensification of a dialogue, as well as by its broadening and 
move from diplomacy to parliament and into sector problems and, 
finally, to local and civil projects. Regional and transborder 
cooperation, as well as German investors' interest in all 
Poland's regions, are very important. 
  We attach great importance to military cooperation, and we 
will strive to expand it. Taking care of Polish citizens and 
citizens of Polish origin living in Germany and the German 
minority living in Poland is the topic of our constant attention. 
  The neighborly, friendly relations with the Czechs, the 
Slovaks, and the Hungarians are developing very well. The 
agreement on free trade--CEFTA [Central European Free Trade 
Association]--is the greatest joint achievement. We believe the 
weakening of the Visegrad Group to be unfavorable. It 
stimulates a search for different ties in Central Europe. We 
are not happy about it because we cannot find a better solution 
than the Visegrad Group. It includes the states that have been 
the leaders among the postcommunist countries of political and 
economic reforms and that unequivocally support integration with 
the EU and NATO. 
  Relations with eastern neighbors have been less developed. 
They are too weak, and our important task is to raise them to 
the level achieved with other neighbors. (...) 
  In this context, relations with Russia are of the utmost 
importance. We have different views on ways of achieving 
European security. This difference, however, should not exclude 
lively bilateral and regional cooperation. 
  Within the program of joint Polish-Russian undertakings 
this year, we are going to conclude a trade protocol for 1994 
and, possibly, for the following years. We will start work on 
an agreement on economic cooperation that, among other things, 
will define the principles and directions for developing 
cooperation links. We will expand transborder cooperation. We 
will review and specify the possibilities for financial and 
banking cooperation. We will undertake work on the setting up 
of a supragovernmental foundation for supporting democracy and 
market reforms in Central and East Europe, activities that will 
compensate for shortcomings in the sphere of information and 
expand the Polish-Russian dialogue to various political issues. 
We will try to set up an association for preventing and 
combating organized crime, including representatives of police, 
prosecutors, the judiciary of the states of the region, and 
Interpol. 
  In relations with Ukraine, we are striving to fill the 
formula of the "close" partnership with material content. In 
relations with Lithuania and Belarus and also with other eastern 
neighbors and countries further afield, such as Moldova and 
Kazakhstan, we concentrate our efforts on creating conditions 
conducive to economic cooperation. We are continuing our active 
participation in regional institutions, in particular in the 
Baltic initiative and the Central European initiative. We will 
contribute with our experience to work on the pact on stability 
with regard to the legal regulation of relations with neighbors 
and with national minorities. 
  We see two threats to the process of building 
good-neighborly 
relations, friendship, and regional cooperation. At the basis 
of this is intolerance and indisposition toward differences. 
Poland is treating all of its neighbors as fully independent 
and sovereign states. 
  The development of friendly bonds in our region can also be 
hampered by the intolerance of one of the nations. 
Unfortunately, we have noticed the symptoms of this in Russia. 
We are afraid of it. We have been alarmed by statements about 
Russia's "particular interests" and "special role" in 
neighboring countries. These are not conducive to the stability 
of the region and of Europe. We do not accept this. 
  The second threat, also having its source in intolerance, is 
nationalism. We can see what it has led to in the former 
Yugoslavia. (...) 
  Poland persistently supports the process of linking the East 
and the West into one whole. We want a practical implementation 
of the principle of indivisibility and security of the whole of 
Europe and, more widely, of the whole European area. We are of 
the opinion that the most direct road toward a Europe without 
divisions is an expansion of proven structures--the North 
Atlantic Treaty and the EU. This expansion does not mean the 
creation of new divisions but the breaking down of old ones. 
That is why we are striving resolutely for our membership in 
these organizations. That is why we support similar attempts by 
other states of the Visegrad Group and treat the membership of 
the group in the Atlantic structures as an important step, but 
also only aa the first step. That is why we support the 
establishment of close ties between NATO and Russia. The 
security of Poland and Europe would not be full and permanent if 
the ultimate system were not to include Russia and our eastern 
neighbors. 
  Our most important goal in 1994 is to create conditions for 
a 
speedy development of cooperation and the compatibility of the 
Polish defense system with the system of NATO. Our 
participation in the Partnership for Peace and a number of 
agreements on bilateral military cooperation serve this purpose. 
We have to maintain the momentum of joining the Partnership. 
The combination of our arguments about the advantages--for 
Poland and for Europe--of expanding NATO and of the realistic 
nature of our offer within the Partnership are yielding good 
results. Further results will depend on our diplomatic efforts 
and even more so on the military dimension of our relations with 
NATO. I want to stress here the full involvement of MON 
[Ministry of National Defense] and the exemplary cooperation of 
both our departments in the actions to date. 
  We will continue our efforts for NATO and WEU [Western 
European Union] membership. We are moving closer toward both 
these goals. In the case of NATO, we cannot count on any 
spectacular results for the moment, unless some dramatic--and 
potentially dangerous for us--events were to take place in 
Russia. Consequently, our task for today is to maintain the 
debate about what is happening. (...) 
  We attach special importance to the discussion with and in 
the United States. A very important occasion for continuing 
this discussion will be President Clinton's visit to Warsaw this 
July. 
  We welcome with satisfaction our associate WEU partnership. 
It constitutes the beginning of the road toward membership and 
the basis for involvement in the work and activities of the 
Union. 
  We are continuing our activity in the CSCE, where we are a 
significant member. We are particular about the full 
implementation by Poland and all partners of the agreements on 
reducing arms and military activities in Europe and about the 
clarity of these agreements. At the United Nations, we are 
concentrating on activities that serve the resolution of 
conflicts, the protection of human rights, and arms reductions 
and disarmament. 
  Our activities for security are encountering obstacles. On 
the one hand, there is the conservatism of Western institutions, 
a fear of opening up, and an unwillingness to take up the 
challenge connected with the election of new members and their 
integration. On the other, there is the conservatism of 
significant political circles in Russia that treat these 
institutions as a threat to Russian national interests. 
Regretfully, today such statements as Minister Kozyrev's last 
year, that Russia "sees the NATO countries as natural friends 
and in the future as allies," are rare. 
  The second fundamental foreign policy task is to ensure the 
best possible conditions for permanent development of our 
country in its entire economic and civilizational spectrum. 
Since 1989, we have consistently been seeking these conditions 
in integration with the European Communities. (...) 
  Just like then, we also can find no better possibilities 
today for ensuring development conditions for Poland than 
participation in the EU. (...) 
  Our future membership is accepted by the Union. An 
expression 
of this is the association treaty and the declaration of the 
Copenhagen summit. 
  Poland must proceed toward the EU consistently and quickly. 
Remaining outside it would mean being a politically marginalized 
country that is economically discriminated against and forced to 
submit to decisions made by others. This choice has no 
alternative: Such are the realities of today's and the future 
Europe. The most important task in 1994 is to determine as 
specifically as possible the road toward Poland's EU membership. 
We are making efforts for an undertaking from the Union on 
Poland's acceptance that would be more binding than the 
Copenhagen declaration. An important opportunity to obtain this 
undertaking will be during the German presidency of the Union, 
which is very well disposed toward our demands. 
  We are striving to initiate joint work on a scenario for 
integrating Polish and European agriculture. (...) 
  We are also striving for further improvement in the access 
of 
goods and services to the Common Market, and we are 
counteracting signs of protectionism. We are looking for ways 
of joining in cooperation in areas covered by a joint EU 
policy--trade, transportation, energy, agriculture, 
environmental protection, finance, and so on. Finally, we are 
striving for increased aid for Poland within PHARE [Economic 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary], as well as from 
other community funds, and for earmarking a greater part of them 
than hitherto for investment purposes. (...) 
  The issue of European integration dominates our relations 
with the West European states. We are increasing the 
initiatives and diplomatic consultations involving them. The 
visit by French Prime Minister Balladur this July will be an 
important event. We will be convincing him that Poland's 
participation in the EU will be to its advantage and not a 
burden to it. We are intensifying dialogue with Great Britain, 
the third state in the European big three, on ways of political 
integration, of which that country is a convinced advocate. 
  The visit by the president and the prime minister to Italy 
confirm the good relations with that country. We are looking 
for new possibilities of cooperation with the medium and smaller 
states of the EU--toward Greece, Spain, Ireland, and Portugal. 
We are intensifying our action explaining our integration 
plans. With the Nordic countries, we are looking for ways to 
strengthen and utilize the promising prospects of dynamic 
development of the Baltic region, linked inter alia to its 
inclusion in the EU. In view of the approaching EU membership 
of the four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states, 
reaching agreement with this group will be of great significance 
for our participation in European integration. We will strive 
for our trade relations with these states not to deteriorate. 
(...) 
  Already today we must translate what are still for many 
people abstract slogans about Poland's membership in the EU into 
specific information and undertakings. This task is urgent, 
given that the prospect of enlarging the Union is not at all 
distant. (...) 
  The greatest threat to the policy of integration is 
protectionism. This problem is still particularly important in 
agriculture. In the association treaty, there is a lack of 
strategic vision of integration in this sector, a lack of will 
to create a common market in this area. Integration must take 
many years here, however, and cannot take place without 
conflicts. Until protectionist resistance is overcome and a 
scenario for including Polish agriculture in the Community is 
created, the prospects of membership will be uncertain. I do 
not have to add that, from our side too, protectionist 
tendencies constitute a real and the most serious threat, apart 
from possible delays in the adaptation processes, to integration 
into the EU. 
  The United States, together with the EU, plays an important 
part in our efforts to ensure the best conditions for the 
development of our country. Traditionally, the Poles see the 
Americans, many of whom are of Polish origin, as friends who are 
sympathetic and ready to cooperate and help. This results in 
our deep belief in the need for a U.S. presence in Europe, for 
our frequent contacts and very intensive political 
dialogue--more lively than that with the European states--as 
well as for the rapidly growing U.S. investments in Poland. Our 
objective is to maintain this situation, our position as the 
main U.S. partner in Central and East Europe, as well as to 
obtain U.S. consent for our integration into NATO. We are 
making promising progress. In the economic field, we attach 
much importance to the program "of emerging large economic 
markets". We like its philosophy, which characterizes sensible 
investors: support for countries that manifest dynamic 
development and that have conditions for becoming regional 
driving forces and, consequently, important economic partners 
for the United States. 
  We are particular about the perfection of our 
multidimensional relations with the Holy See. An additional 
reason for this today is the fact that the Holy Father is the 
best disposed toward us foreign head of state. We must not 
forget this when debating the ratification of the concordat, 
because our relations will enter a difficult phase without it. 
  We are trying to broaden our circle of important economic 
partners. We are looking for them among East Asian and Middle 
East countries. (...) 
  This year's visits, President Walesa's to Japan and Prime 
Minister Pawlak's to China, will provide opportunities to 
present our plans and win over partners for them. We will 
extend our Partnership for Development initiative toward them, 
as well as toward other states that cooperate with us. Neither 
do we forget the developing states. They include many people 
who are very sympathetic to us. We maintain with them regular 
contacts that are commensurate with our interests and abilities. 
  We are participating in the work on UN reform. We maintain 
intense cooperation with the IMF, the World Bank, and the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We have 
applied for OECD membership, and we are trying to normalize the 
conditions of our GATT membership. We have joined the World 
Trade Organization created under the Uruguay Round. We have 
started work to ensure our participation in the organization 
that is to replace COCOM [Coordinating Committee on Export 
Controls]. 
  We are intensifying international cooperation on 
environmental protection. This year we will sign appropriate 
agreements with Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belarus, 
and Lithuania, and we will strengthen our presence in the Baltic 
region. Together with the Sejm commissions, we want to 
determine with greater precision the aims and means for the 
promotion of Polish culture so that it can facilitate the 
development of our country. We are seeking ways of linking 
international scientific exchange to the economy, without which 
its development would be constantly hindered by insufficient 
state resources. 
  Perhaps the greatest progress we have made is in the field 
of 
creating conditions for the free development of personal 
contacts. Today we can travel abroad without excessive formal 
impediments. However, this does not mean that travel is easy and 
that we are welcomed everywhere with open arms. Nor does it 
mean that our relatives, fellow countrymen who permanently live 
abroad, are well treated there and can visit us freely. We have 
to expand and civilize our border crossing points. (...) 
  The provision for our fellow countrymen of their rightful, 
proper, and safe conditions for cultivating their Polish 
provenance is more difficult. We attach much importance to this 
task. We consistently enforce the rights provided for under 
international norms and guaranteed under agreements. We will 
strive to protect Poles in Kazakhstan. We are continuing our 
activities that serve to cultivate the Polish language, 
traditions, and culture. 
  The most difficult task, however, is changing the Poles' and 
foreigners' stereotyped images, both positive and negative. 
Foreigners who are well disposed toward us see us as patriots 
ready for heroic deeds, as fervent Catholics, and as romantics. 
There is nothing in this image about enterprise, education, and 
present-day know-how. It is dominated by grave faces, with 
blood and horsemen in the background. Those who think ill of us 
see Poles as lazy workers, cantankerous politicians, corrupt 
bureaucrats, and fraudulent businessmen, and Poland as a country 
of dirt and mess. In fact, both images are grim. They do not 
encourage contacts. We have to change them, lighten them, show 
that Poland is a country of great opportunities and talented 
people. We have to promote Poles and Poland. 
  These are our three tasks--durable security, favorable 
conditions for development, and freedom of personal 
contacts--and the four greatest threats to them are intolerance, 
conservatism, protectionism, and stereotypes. These are the 
fundamental parameters of our foreign activity. 
  There is also a domestic dimension. Today it is perhaps the 
most important one. Rarely in its history has Poland had such a 
favorable situation and such good opportunities for development 
as now. It is very much up to us whether we are going to make 
use of these. 
  We are modernizing our foreign service. We want to eliminate 
the lack of separation between the fields of "politics" and 
"administration," which is no longer found in modern 
democracies. We will achieve this by separating out in the 
ministry the minister's political servicing apparatus. (...) 
  The official apparatus at the ministry will be headed by a 
general secretary assisted by his deputies. The officials' 
duties and powers, the criteria for their selection, 
subordination, and promotion, will be defined by an act. I have 
already sent the bill for interdepartmental consultation. (...) 
  Second, we would like to introduce a number of solutions 
strengthening the coordination of foreign policy.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "Five Extraparliamentary </F>
Groupings Will Form a Confederation Today; Flirting With the 
Right"] 
  [Text] The Conservative Party [PK], Center Accord [PC], 
Movement for the Republic [RdR], and Christian-National Union 
[ZChN] will become the Polish Union confederation on Thursday 
[12 May]. They intend to run jointly in the self-governmental 
elections and then in the parliamentary elections; they also 
want to back the same candidate for president. 
  There is more to the confederation than the forms of 
cooperation among these parties so far; however, it is less than 
their leaders declared immediately after the last elections. At 
that time, they were speaking about the necessity of uniting 
quickly. 
<H5>  What There Has Been: Partings and Comebacks </H5>
  Before the parliamentary elections in 1991, for the PC, 
which 
was quite a significant party, the ZChN was a minor little party 
full of phobias. Jaroslaw Kaczynski was trying to build up the 
image of his party as a proreform, center grouping, as a modern 
Christian democracy. The PC considered the ZChN to be extremely 
rightist, a traditional grouping that, conscious of its own 
weakness, wanted to enter the parliament by gaining the support 
of the church and by concealing itself behind the slogan of WAK 
(Electoral Catholic Action). 
  After the elections, this ceased to bother Kaczynski--it 
turned out that the ZChN would have a considerable club in the 
parliament. 
  Both parties survived several months in a joint coalition 
supporting the Olszewski government; they defended it with 
determination. Then they unanimously turned against the 
"recommunist government of Pawlaks and Wachowskis" (this is what 
the Pawlak Cabinet was called by the participants of the PC 
congress, which was being held at the time). 
  At that time: The RdR is formed within the PC and leaves the 
grouping (the RdR is the third participant of the confederation 
that is being formed today). Relations between both parties are 
not very good, largely because of the circumstances under which 
the RdR was formed--as a result of a split within the PC. Apart 
from that, Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Jan Olszewski were already not 
really fond of each other at that time. 
  The Suchocka government is formed. At night, during 
negotiations on the establishment of this cabinet, the 
center-rightist "five" splits. The PC leaves the conference 
room, the other groupings remain (the ZChN; Peasant Accord; the 
Party of Christian Democrats, PChD; and even the closest ally of 
the PC at the time, the Peasant-Christian Party, the SLCh). 
This is a defeat for Kaczynski's prestige. 
  The ZChN, in coalition with the Democratic Union [UD] and 
the 
liberals, goes through a stage of "civilizing." The ministers 
of the party of Wieslaw Chrzanowski cooperate quite well with 
the ministers of UD and the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD]. 
UD, the KLD, and the ZChN become so accustomed to one another 
that, after the downfall of the government, there are 
politicians who mention the possibility of forming a joint 
coalition in the September 1993 parliamentary elections. 
  In the meantime, the PC also goes through a period of 
transformation, but in an entirely different direction. It does 
not decide to become a "constructive" opposition to the Suchocka 
cabinet. In the parliament, the PC is alone; being jointly in 
the opposition does not cause Olszewski and Kaczynski to join 
forces. Olszewski on his side and Kaczynski on his gather 
smaller, very radical rightist groupings around them. 
  From the fall of 1992 to the spring of 1993, a number of 
cooperation declarations are signed, and coalitions for Poland 
are established. These are the times of the "June Left," of 
rightist politicians' touring Poland. 
  The PC expresses sharp criticism of the Suchocka government 
and the ZChN. Politicians of the ZChN retaliate and make ironic 
remarks concerning Kaczynski's party. 
  The Suchocka government, not long before its downfall, is 
left by the PL--the fourth grouping making up the confederation 
today (it proved disloyal to the ZChN, with which it was an ally 
at the time). 
  Within the Suchocka government is Aleksander Hall's PK. 
After the elections in September 1993, it is left by Kazimierz 
Michal Ujazdowski and his supporters; they form the Conservative 
Coalition [KK] (the last party of the "five" that make up the 
confederation today). 
  Before the 1993 elections, differences between the PC and 
the 
ZChN are so great that no one, aside from a few politicians, 
even mentions the possibility of a joint election campaign. The 
roles change. Now the ZChN is a serious, proreform, civilized 
grouping, whereas the PC is a small, "leader-oriented" party of 
Jaroslaw Kaczynski, driven by internal conflicts. 
  The ZChN runs in the elections as the "Fatherland" 
coalition, along with the "rightist" component of the Suchocka 
cabinet: Hall's PK, the PChD, and the SLCh; the PC runs alone, 
just like the PL and the RdR. 
  In the ensuing postelection shock, politicians of the 
rightist groupings began to admit their mistakes and to announce 
unification soon. 
<H5>  What There Is: A Confederation </H5>
  The confederation means not only less than unification but 
even less than a federation. The five groupings will not have a 
common leader. The constituent parties will maintain their 
organizational identities. However, a council will be 
established that will be an authority superior to the 
authorities of the individual parties. 
  What stands in the way to unification of the five parties, 
aside from their past? The parties do not want to give up their 
identities. Each of them (this applies particularly to the 
ZChN, however) believes that, as an independent party and by 
maintaining its own structure, it may mean more than as a party 
unified with other groupings). 
  Rightist politicians say that the greatest drawback of their 
part of the political scene is not the large number of parties 
but the existence, in almost each of them, of internal 
divisions. Right now, they can be seen most easily in the ZChN, 
but they also exist in the PL. The party that is most uniform 
today is the PC. 
  Characteristic of the rightist part of the political scene 
are great ambitions of the leaders of the groupings; in 
addition, those leaders often do not really like each other. It 
is difficult to imagine a situation in which Kaczynski, 
Chrzanowski, Szeremietiew, and Janowski are supposed to decide 
which one person will be the leader of the joint grouping. 
  Among those five groupings, there are real programmatic 
differences. It would be difficult to reconcile the definitely 
negative attitude toward trade unions, presented by Michal 
Ujazdowski's KK (in the previous Sejm, Ujazdowski was one of the 
initiators of the bill on limiting the role of trade unions) 
with the stand of the PL (which has its origins in the 
Individual Farmers' Solidarity) as well as the sentimental 
approach to Solidarity that is taken by Kaczynski, Szeremietiew, 
and Chrzanowski. 
  It would also be difficult to reconcile the PL's conviction 
about the need for broad state intervention in the economy, with 
the liberal approach of the KK. 
  Apart from that, the parties also differ, among other 
things, 
in their attitude toward integration with Europe: the 
pro-European approach of the PC and the KK is confronted with 
the approach of the ZChN, which may be called "Euro-skeptical." 
  If unification talks were actually held, the parties of the 
"five," especially the PC and the ZChN, would certainly quarrel 
if they were to verify the real strength of both parties in 
regions. This would be closely connected to the distribution of 
influence in the authorities and on the election lists of the 
common party. 
  An issue that would have to be resolved if unification were 
to actually take place would also be the definition of the 
attitude toward the one-person rightist force that is 
represented by Jan Olszewski. Even though the former prime 
minister is now the honorary president of the RdR (not 
Szeremietiew's RdR), he is not really taking part in the 
political life of the right wing. His political activities boil 
down to meetings with his supporters in church halls, cultural 
centers, etc. He is advocating the model of concentrating the 
rightist groupings with Solidarity. At his most recent meeting 
on 9 May in the lower church of St. Andrew Bobola, he received 
the greatest applause when he spoke about Walesa and said good 
things about Solidarity. 
<H5>  What Will There Be? </H5>
  Rightist politicians are afraid of establishing too quickly 
something that might break apart with a thump, which would 
finally compromise the right wing. Apart from that, unification 
carried out too quickly and forcefully might dissatisfy some of 
the parties' members. 
  In reply to the accusation that the confederation is a form 
that is supposed to replace real unification, the rightist 
politicians say that they are implementing the plan that was 
agreed upon early this year: first a confederation, then a 
federation. 
  Activists of the ZChN and the PC no longer say today that 
the 
final purpose of the process of "unification" is real 
unification. "It may be one party, but it does not have to be"; 
we hear both in the PC--that is, in a party that seemed to be 
all for unification, and in the ZChN, a party that most opposed 
the idea.

<F P=106> [Article by B.M.: "KRRiT Resolution; 45 Minutes for </F>
Political Parties"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, after five months' work, the National 
Council of Radio and Television [KRRiT] adopted a resolution on 
access of political parties to public radio and television. A 
decision on access of state organs to Polish Television will be 
made by KRRiT this morning. 
  Every week the most numerous political parties will be able 
to present themselves on Polish Television in a program that 
will be prepared jointly by television journalists and the 
parties' representatives. According to unofficial information 
that we learned from KRRiT, Polish Television President Wieslaw 
Walendziak is not really delighted with this solution; he 
believes, however, that this kind of the parties' "windows," in 
the form of a magazine program, will make it easier for 
political parties to get access to television. Cooperation in 
the creation of a model of such a program was declared by KRRiT, 
which is going to invite the parties and the public broadcaster 
to work out a set of rules for the appearances of the parties on 
television. 
  Along with the resolution, KRRiT prepared a statement in 
which it draws attention to the general mannerism of 
broadcasters, who violate the integrity of statements by 
shortening them or by lowering the volume of the voices of 
politicians who are talking with journalists. According to 
KRRiT, it is proof of nonprofessionalism, which is not found in 
the West. Some KRRiT members note that people are presented 
with the danger of the council's censorship, whereas the worst 
type of censorship is employed by journalists, who cut out two 
out of four spoken sentences as they wish. 
  The KRRiT statement also mentions a dangerous blurring of 
responsibility: The Polish Television president, the head of the 
Television Information Agency (there is an autonomy in 
information programs), and the directors of the individual 
programs are not really responsible for mistakes in information 
programs. The most important decisions here are made by the 
editor of a particular program, who is often only an associate 
member of television. It is necessary to make this 
responsibility clear, says the KRRiT statement.

<F P=106> [Article by Czeslaw Rychlewski: "Reprivatization--Difficult </F>
Comebacks"] 
  [Text] Every government of the Third Polish Republic 
avoided implementing reprivatization by saying it had other, 
more important issues with which to deal. Naturally, there was 
just one reason: They wanted to prevent stirring up social moods 
against the backdrop of possible conflicts between the former 
owners and the new users, and also given the issue of burdens on 
the budget. 
  A draft reprivatization law prepared by the Ownership 
Transformations Ministry headed by Janusz Lewandowski, in 
cooperation with the Consultative Council for Reprivatization, 
was the one that was the most likely candidate for being 
submitted to a vote in the Sejm. Council Chairman Krzysztof 
Laszkiewicz says: "A year ago, we reached a consensus. The 
draft law was designed in a way that would prevent placing a 
burden on the budget and that would prevent taking anything out 
of anybody's pocket. Out of its 80 provisions, as many as 19 
related to the protection of third parties, which means they 
were intended to prevent possible conflicts. Besides, the law 
treated all former owners in the same way." 
<H5>  Chances and Nuances </H5>
  The draft law, the final stages of which were interrupted by 
the parliament's dissolution, provided for three forms of 
returning property that had been nationalized in the period of 
the Polish People's Republic [PRL]: return of property in its 
natural form, return in the form of substitute property, and 
return in the form of reprivatization coupons for which one 
could acquire shares in companies subject to privatization, as 
well as immovable property owned by the State Treasury, such as 
apartments. 
  So former owners faced the prospect of regaining as much of 
the property that had been taken away by the PRL as possible. 
Both those who were deprived of property in violation of the 
law in effect in the PRL and those who fell victim to legally 
implemented nationalization measures were supposed to be treated 
on equal footing. So it is no wonder that, when Suchocka's 
government was heading for a fall, the Union of Real Politics 
approached the reprivatization issue as a bargaining chip in the 
no-confidence vote. The party's offer--to support the 
government in return for a speedy vote on the reprivatization 
law--was rejected, and rumor has it that the offer did not even 
reach all those concerned (a certain moral authority, Lech 
Prochno-Wroblewski says, assured that the law was blocked). 
  The law in this shape and form, which is satisfactory to 
former owners, raised the doubts of both politicians and the 
public. The Catholic right wing raised the point that the 
property had often been acquired in a manner that could not be 
described as completely honest. The left wing, on the other 
hand, was trying to use the argument that, after several 
decades, workers have a right to regard themselves as owners of 
the enterprises in which they had invested their labor. 
Journalists reminded everyone that, in the PRL period, losses 
were suffered not just by owners of factories or of real estate 
holdings, but also by many ordinary citizens who were illegally 
arrested, deprived of educational opportunities, or denied 
passports, just to name a few injustices. If all of them 
decided to demand that the Third Republic compensate them for 
losses suffered, the state's finances would face the danger of 
disaster. 
  Members of the Consultative Council for Reprivatization, 
however, argued that a return of property to its owners is the 
simplest form of reinstating a capitalist ownership structure 
that would not be excessively expensive for the state. 
Returning property in its natural form would apply mainly to 
small enterprises that currently are often being neglected or 
that have been devastated. The return of the owners was 
supposed to reinstate economic efficiency to enterprises. It 
was also argued that the same type of outcome should result from 
taking over substitution property, of which there is plenty in 
Poland and for which no owner can be found in many cases, even 
for a symbolic 1 zloty. Opponents, on the other hand, argued 
that there are no such guarantees because the former owners 
currently have no money, which means that they have no resources 
with which to invest, while possible heirs often have no idea of 
business dealings. Examples of enterprises going bankrupt 
shortly after their former owners were reinstated were cited. 

<H5>    A Change of Course </H5>
  The draft law, which had not seen a vote because of the 
parliament's dissolution, returned to the Second Term Sejm in a 
slightly modified version and as an initiative coming from 79 
Sejm deputies. Members of associations grouping former owners 
say they had had reason to believe that the government would 
support this version of the law. But what really happened was 
that there occurred a change of course a month ago. As a 
result, according to Tadeusz Koss, a spokesman for the president 
of the Polish Union of Real Estate Owners, the current 
worker/peasant government legitimized the nationalization that 
another worker/peasant government had implemented before. 
  The decision to prepare a governmental draft law was made at 
a session of the Council of Ministers in April. The chief of 
the Ownership Transformations Ministry was given just a few 
weeks in which to come up with the draft. It is known right now 
that the draft differs substantially from the Sejm deputies' 
draft, to the disadvantage of former owners. 
  First of all, claims are to be limited to cases of violation 
of the legal system in effect in the PRL in the 1944-58 period. 
The draft provides for reimbursement in the form of 
reprivatization coupons, but not up to the full amount of the 
value of the property concerned. Only owners of illegally 
nationalized property worth up to 1 billion zlotys would receive 
their equivalents in the form of coupons. With regard to the 
remaining owners, a regression scale will be applied. The 
possibility of returning some property in its natural form, 
which was suggested during last week's session of the Council of 
Ministers' Economic Committee, has not been settled yet. This 
would apply first of all to small enterprises loosely tied to 
the agricultural sector. 
  According to Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw 
Kaczmarek, the government, while working on the alternative 
draft, had to take into account the effects of the 
reprivatization law on the budget and also had to see to it that 
the legal provisions do not cause new grievances. Similar 
solutions, Kaczmarek stated, were adopted in other postsocialist 
countries, such as Hungary. Both draft laws will be debated by 
the Sejm in late May/early June. There is no doubt in the minds 
of the former owners that the governmental draft law will obtain 
a majority. 
<H5>  The State as the Accused </H5>
  The Council of Ministers' decision raised an enormous 
commotion among former owners. Very strong words were voiced in 
assessments of the governmental draft. Krzysztof Laszkiewicz 
pointed out that the law in its new form will deprive of their 
rights those who were able to execute their claims based on the 
Code of Administrative Procedure. Up to now, courts have 
recognized applications for reimbursements worth a total of 690 
billion zlotys, and these amounts have not been paid out by the 
budget. Those whose property was taken away from them in 
violation of the legal system do not need the law at all. 
  According to Lech Prochno-Wroblewski, the draft law prepared 
by the government is of a partial nature and therefore will 
settle nothing and nobody will benefit. He also warns that the 
500,000 former owners will, from now on, unanimously act to the 
right wing's advantage because they convinced themselves that 
heirs to robbers will not give anything back. 
  On the other hand, Miroslaw Szypowski, chairman of the 
Polish 
Union of Real Estate Owners, says that applications will be sent 
out en masse to the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva, to 
debate the rights of former owners whose property interests 
suffered. The committee's task is to guard the observance of 
ownership rights, based on the UN Charter that Poland has 
signed. Says Szypowski: "Verdicts may result in adjudication of 
many trillions of zlotys, and the Polish state will be the 
accused."

  [Text] Warsaw, 12 May--Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy today 
received General Zhang Wannian, chief of the General Staff of 
the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a Sejm Chancellery 
communique reads. 
  "While striving toward NATO and European structures' 
membership, we will not forget our good cooperation with China. 
Our countries have always respected their individual 
characteristics and their adopted solutions," the Sejm speaker 
said. 
  General Wannian, who is in Poland at the invitation of 
General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the General Staff of the 
Polish armed forces, shared his impressions of the visit. He 
stressed the good combat training of the Polish Army and the 
warm reception he encountered. He expressed the hope that 
Polish-Chinese relations will continue and that the visit of a 
Sejm delegation to China, scheduled for the end of May, will 
strengthen these relations, the communique reads.

    [Editorial Report] At a 20 April news conference, General 
Roman Harmoza, the recently appointed chief of the Defense 
Ministry personnel department, discussed the major personnel 
issues facing the Polish military and, in particular, the plans 
for the Polish officer corps in a period of downsizing, 
reorganization, and redefinition of mission. Harmoza explained 
to the assembled reporters that "the most important task for the 
Army personnel department at this time is adjusting the Army's 
structures to the needs of a much smaller army. The 
reorganization of the armed forces will mean eliminating a 
number of positions and some military units as well as the 
creation of new garrisons." Harmoza noted that, as it downsizes, 
the Polish Army will also be increasing its reliance on career 
soldiers instead of conscripts. He estimated that, by the turn 
of the century, half of the Polish Army will be composed of 
professional soldiers. Nevertheless, the number of career 
officers will decrease, and promotions will be slower in coming 
than in the past. Harmoza expressed his belief that "a smaller, 
elite officers corps will increase the prestige of the Army." 
Requirements for noncommissioned officers will also be 
tightened, with secondary-school diplomas being made obligatory. 
(Currently, only 40 percent of Polish NC0's are secondary-school 
graduates.) (RZECZPOSP0LITA 21 Apr 94) 
  However, the general did not foresee the need for forced 
reductions in the officer corps beyond the strict enforcement of 
mandatory retirement at age 60. For the time being, the size of 
the officers corps will be frozen at the 1993 level. All 
promotions will depend on the number of slots that are vacated 
and will be dictated by the "needs of the Army" and justified by 
the "impeccable behavior" of the officer. (GAZETA WYBORCZA 21 
Apr 94) 
  Harmoza emphasized that the change of government after the 
1993 elections has not slowed down the process of reforming 
military institutions. All decisions are made according to the 
legitimate military hierarchy, with the commander in chief, the 
minister of defense, and the chief of the General Staff 
collaborating on all important initiatives. He stated that the 
decommunization problem no longer exists in the military because 
a large part of the old officer corps has already left the 
service. (In the years 1989-94, more than 22,000 officers, 
including 58 generals, left the Army.) Harmoza assured his 
listeners that "the Army will not take part in any coup 
d'etat--the Army today is mature, apolitical, and staffed with 
new and different people." (TRYBUNA 21 Apr 94)

<F P=106> [Article by "sad:" "NBP on Current Exchange With Foreign </F>
Countries--Still Negative"] 
  [Text] The National Bank of Poland [NBP] reports 
that, after the first quarter of the year, the foreign trade 
deficit was $268 million. Despite the deficit, the state's 
foreign currency reserves exceeded the figure of $5 billion. 
  In its monthly reports on a balance of routine exchange, the 
NBP takes into account trade with foreign countries involving 
merchandise, services, the repayment of interest rates on 
foreign debts, and the transfer of hard currency. The NBP 
calculates the balance on the basis of reports on changes in the 
balance of bank accounts from several dozen banks that are 
middlemen in foreign trade transactions. 
  After the first quarter of this year, the routine exchange 
deficit was $438 million. 
<H5>  Trade Involving Merchandise </H5>
  "The trade deficit involving merchandise after the first 
quarter was lower by $100 million compared with a year ago, but 
it nevertheless surpassed the $268-million mark," Jozef Sobota, 
a director at the NBP's Analysis Department, told journalists 
yesterday [12 May]. Over the same period, export revenues came 
to $3.489 billion (14.8 percent less than during three months of 
last year), while import expenditures amounted to $3.757 billion 
(an increase of 10.2 percent). "Preliminary data indicate that, 
in April, the trade balance involving merchandise could possibly 
be positive," director Sobota stated. 
<H5>  Services and Property Income </H5>
  In the first three months of this year, revenue from the 
sale 
of services (this mainly refers to transportation) exceeded 
expenditures borne of having the services brought in by $74 
million, despite the fact that, in March, the deficit was $6 
million (last year it was $2 million). 
  Property income (including, among other things, dividends 
paid to Polish companies for participation in foreign companies) 
amounted to $17 million after the first quarter (a year ago it 
was $24 million). 
<H5>  Interest Rates and Transfers </H5>
  The negative balance of interest rates being paid on foreign 
debts was $1.119 billion, which is a decrease of $351 million 
compared with a year ago. This happened despite the fact that 
we had to repay $634 million to the Paris Club in March. 
  Official transfers amounted to $765 million, out of which 
$734 million was the 80 percent of interest rates that the Paris 
Club decided to write off for us. After the first quarter, the 
balance of private transfers was $93 million (last year it was 
$106 million). 
<H5>  Dollar Reserves </H5>
  Despite the trade deficit, the NBP's official reserves were 
$5.080 billion after the first quarter. The reserves rose by as 
much as $704 million just since March, and that figure includes 
the $504 million of credit obtained from the IMF. 
  In the view of the NBP, the so-called border-area exports, 
among others, had a very big impact on the level of the 
reserves: Tourists leave hard currency, thus contributing to a 
surplus in the purchases of hard currency at hard-currency 
exchange units; that surplus was $758 million.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirjana Jevtic -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] [Jevtic] According to the recently adopted Law on 
Foreign Exchange Loans, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has 
authorized its central bank to assume loans in the amount of 
$300 million both in-country and abroad in the name of and for 
the federal state. In order to collect this sum, the National 
Bank of Yugoslavia has signed the first contract on loans with 
Belgrade Bank, Invest Bank, and Beobank. The job is worth $10 
million and at the same marks the beginning of the realization 
of Financial Pool No. 2 of the Program of Monetary 
Reconstruction and Economic Recovery. According to Nikola 
Stanic, vice governor of the National Bank, the loans granted 
will be transferred to the country's foreign exchange reserves 
and will be used as a foreign exchange backing for the new 
dinar. This will at the same time represent the additional 
financial boost for furthering economic activities in the 
country. 
  [Belgrade Bank Director Ljubisa Igic, identified by caption] 
We see our interests here. The conditions under which we are 
granting the loan to the National Bank, that is, to the state of 
Yugoslavia are in fact market conditions .... 
  [Jevtic] The fact that banks are now giving their own money 
to support the program means that they have to look after it in 
a different, more serious manner than they have done to date. 
  [Igic] Certainly. In fact, this money will again come to 
banking and financial channels through the economy. It will be 
a basis for general economic activity in the coming period. 
This money has not been given away for good ignoring this 
economy, our bank's savers, and our shareholders. 
  [Jevtic] By the way, the Belgrade Bank, Invest Bank, and 
Beobank were the first to grant foreign exchange loans to the 
National Bank of Yugoslavia in conformity with the adopted law. 
Therefore, the loan has been given to two years with a one-year 
delay in payment and a flexible domicile rate of exchange for 
individual foreign currencies. 
  This week and the next, the management of the National Bank 
of Yugoslavia will sign individual contracts with several dozen 
banks so that the planned $300 million can be ensured as soon as 
possible.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 12 (TANJUG) -- The foreign ministers 
of the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United 
Nations will have their final say at a meeting in Geneva as 
regards the framework of a political settlement for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, diplomatic circles in Belgrade said on 
Thursday. This platform for the conclusion of the two-year-old 
civil war among the Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats could 
include three major parts, the diplomatic circles said. 
  The first part is an unconditional ceasefire in the entire 
territory of ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on 
which the Bosnian Serb leadership has been insisting for months 
and which, nevertheless, has invariably been rejected by the 
Bosnian Muslims. The second part is the territorial delineation 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The prevailing opinion in diplomatic circles in Belgrade is 
that the Geneva meeting will take as its point of departure the 
map, previously proposed by the European Union, envisaging 
virtually that Bosnian Serbs get 49 percent of the entire 
territory, while the Bosnian Muslims and Croats should get 51 
percent. The third part of the Geneva talks could concern the 
U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), i.e. 
their linking with the first two parts and consequently their 
lifting as soon as these two parts are completed. 
  Bearing all that in mind, a decision to be later adopted by 
participants in a summit on Bosnia-Herzegovina could be taken in 
Geneva, the circles said. A deal on the `division of tasks' 
should not, of course, be ruled out which means that in the 
process of implementing that plan the United States would be in 
charge of the Bosnian Muslims, Russia in charge of the Bosnian 
Serbs and Germany in charge of the Bosnian Croats. 
  It is yet to be seen what the outcome of the latest meeting 
in Geneva will be, where in the past two years many attempts 
have been made to settle the Bosnian conflict. None of these 
attempts, however, have been successful and, as it has been 
announced in Moscow, Washington, London and Brussels, all 
participants in the Geneva meeting are now resolute to bring 
this issue to an end. 
  In such circumstances, the Geneva meeting could also be the 
point of decision, the diplomatic circles said.

  [Excerpt] The Federal Government has submitted answers to 
questions posed by deputies at the Federal Assembly. The 
government suggests that the law on military schools and 
military scientific institutions be adopted in an urgent 
procedure. Let us listen to a report by Mirjana Protic: 
  [Begin Protic recording] The Federal Ministry of Defense 
asserts that there has so far been no incidence of a Yugoslav 
Army warehouse being broken into. This is the gist of the reply 
to a question by a deputy. The weapons used by individuals and 
illegal military [words indistinct] of members of the NCA 
[expansion unknown] so far mostly originate from battlefields in 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. They are also brought through 
various smuggling channels from Turkey via Albania. Certain 
humanitarian organizations such as Merhamet [word indistinct] 
channels for smuggling arms to the territory of Raska Region. 
Several smuggling channels that involved former members of the 
Yugoslav People's Army of Muslim nationality who had gone over 
to the Army of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, have also been 
discovered. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Lj. Cudomirovic: "The Money Is Going to Reserves </F>
Instead of to Loans"] 
  [Text] The decision of the National Bank of Yugoslavia 
[NBJ] to raise overnight the so-called mandatory reserve for 
dinar deposits from 10 to 15 percent (on new dinars) and from 3 
to 7 percent (on old dinars) is clumsy to say the least, and its 
consequences will have the greatest impact on production. After 
all, it was adopted in a period of what was already an 
appreciable reduction of bank liquidity, so that many who found 
themselves in an extremely unenviable situation are being 
charged with sabotaging the program by being slow to extend 
loans for production, while at the same time funds are being 
withdrawn from the accounts that are actually the only ones from 
which they can extend credits to the economy. In practical 
terms, many among them, for all practical purposes the largest 
ones, have been compelled to seek a way out either through 
premature withdrawal of credit or a forced sale of the foreign 
exchange, which they were thought to have in much greater 
quantities than the facts indicate. 
  This was all reported in yesterday's meeting of the 
Committee 
for Banking and Financial Affairs in the Serbian Economic 
Chamber, where the bankers stated their position on the most 
urgent matters of monetary policy and bank liquidity. 
  According to Dragoljub Vukosavljevic, president of Union 
Bank, the NBJ and other banks have a vital interest in the fate 
of the program for monetary reconstruction, but the higher 
liquidity of the banks is not the main culprit for the pegging 
that is being done. What is more, the figure that no less than 
27 percent of the total money supply is now in the hands of the 
public was in his opinion a much stronger reason for alarm than 
the threat to further implementation of the program represented 
by the amounts in the giro accounts of the banks. After all, 
compared to 26 March, when the banks had a total of 187 million 
dinars, by 9 April they had only 79 million dinars, and today 
they have a total of barely somewhere between 50 and 60 million, 
including the cash in cash drawers, without which they cannot 
operate. 
  In his opinion, this situation with bank liquidity and the 
most recent measure to raise the mandatory reserves, and on that 
basis withdraw no less than 30 million dinars from bank giro 
accounts, could be a severe blow to the credit financing of 
production, especially agriculture, which is right now on the 
threshold of large seasonal investments in planting operations. 
The situation is even so absurd that some of the banks will not 
be able to raise the mandatory reserves without being overdrawn. 
  Marko Steljic, president of Jugobanka (JU Bank) Joint-Stock 
Company, said the issue of whether there is a surplus of money 
in circulation or less money is the key issue whose resolution 
is being insisted on equally by both the banks and enterprise 
collectives which have already undertaken to invigorate 
production. The present level of credit financing of the economy 
(700 million dinars) is not enough, because that amount could 
only satisfy the annual needs of Jugobanka. In his opinion, 
then, the banks themselves will have to undertake urgent 
reorganization of their own business operation and reduction of 
the size of their staff, but that also applies both to the NBJ 
and all the others. 
  Zika Ilic, president of the PKB Bank, was of the opinion 
that 
the decision of the NBJ to increase the mandatory reserves was 
hasty and not backed up by a carefully studied calculation. He 
also put the quite specific question of whether this country 
needs such a large staff in the National Bank of Yugoslavia, in 
the settlement system, but also in the commercial banks 
themselves, when it is thought that no less than half of the 
staff are unnecessary. Dr. Milovan Milutinovic, chairman of the 
board and general secretary of the Association of Yugoslav 
Banks, and Milomir Spasic, president of Slavija Bank, recalled 
at the end that the NBJ also has far more delicate mechanisms 
and instruments for determining the total money supply that 
would equally satisfy both the invigoration of production 
without being an additional source of inflation and without 
affording an opportunity for the pegging of foreign exchange. In 
that connection, the bank has agreed that there is now an urgent 
need to bring various securities onto the financial scene.

<F P=106> [Article by Jovan Dulovic: "The Career of the Federal </F>
Minister for Information"] 
  [Text] Year and place of birth: 1947, the 
village Gligovac near Smederevska Palanka, Socialist Republic of 
Serbia. 
  What he is known for: As minister for information 
in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Government he 
announced expulsion of journalists back on 13 June of last year 
("Is it not illogical for so many falsehoods about the FRY to go 
out into the world, when credentials have not been taken away 
from a single journalist") and he recently decided to prohibit 
some 14 foreign journalists from working because of 
"satanization of the FRY and the Serbian people," which divided 
the domestic public and embittered the world public. 
  What they reproach him for in the SPS [Socialist Party 
of Serbia]: He is a member of the most hard-line current 
among the incumbent members of the government and an unwavering 
advocate of the motto: Whoever is not with us must go. Ratomir 
Vico, newly appointed information minister in the Serbian 
Government, recently explained to him on a television program 
(there is a question of how serious he was) that Radio-TV Serbia 
must also broadcast the relevant views of opposition parties and 
groupings. Ignjatovic thanked him for having supplemented and 
spelled out his previously expressed thought that government 
television must exclusively represent the interests of the state. 
  What the opposition has against him: As director 
of Radio-TV Serbia he did not allow coverage of the Saint Vitus' 
Day Rally. He explained his decision this way: "There is no 
reason for TV Belgrade to cover the rally when this is already 
being done by Independent TV Studio B and TV Politika" (BORBA, 3 
July 1992). Some 17 deputies of DEPOS [Democratic Movement of 
Serbia], New Democracy, the Democratic Party, the People's Party 
of Montenegro, and the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro in 
the Citizens Chamber of the Assembly demanded that Ignjatovic be 
dismissed because of the expulsion of the foreign journalists, 
because that decision "placed the FRY and its citizens in still 
greater isolation from the world." 
  How he got into politics: When KOMUNIST was shut 
down, where he restated in his own words the speeches of party 
bigwigs and said that there was no salvation for us without 
self-management of the working class, he went over to POLITIKA 
EKSPRES as an expert on the economy, but because he was not good 
at writing commentary, he thought about opening a grocery store. 
In the end, he gave that up and was elected a member of the 
Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, 
which soon fell apart. Consistent with the policy of his party, 
he joined the management team of POLITIKA EKSPRES: editor in 
chief Slobodan Jovanovic, former executive secretary of the city 
committee of the League of Communists, and Dragoljub Milanovic, 
also a former executive secretary of the League of Communists of 
Serbia. 
  How he won political points: His rating on the 
list of personnel jumped up sharply when with his perspicacity 
and comprehensive analysis he discovered and published that 
"fascistoid Ante Markovic is driving the people into beggary" 
and "intends to destroy Serbia and Yugoslavia." He announced to 
the public that "it was during the term of A. Markovic that 
inflation reached the highest level in the history of this 
country" (POLITIKA EKSPRES, 11 November 1990). 
  What he has against certain periodicals: In an 
article entitled "The Independent Are Sullying the People" 
(VECERNJE NOVOSTI, 6 December 1993), in speaking about some of 
the media, Ignjatovic said that they "usually say that the 
present government is fascist." 
  What he promised: Announcing the "offensive and 
preventive strategy of the ministry which he heads" (POLITIKA, 7 
May 1993), Ignjatovic made the public announcement: "We have 
formed an intersector group which will take the offensive in 
supplying information in the FRY. We are studying the moves of 
all our media `friends' and we will be ready and waiting with 
everything cooked up in advance so that we can take appropriate 
steps in good time" (VECERNJE NOVOSTI, 13 June 1993). The 
results of that group are not evident, at least for the present. 
  What his qualifications are: He graduated from the 
School of Philosophy at Belgrade University and took a master's 
degree in the School of Economics. 
  What he should be afraid of: Those who put him in 
the post of minister. 
  What inspires him: The investigative journalism of 
his young colleagues, of which he was an example at EKSPRES. In 
this style: "A full barrel of Serbian eyes from which the 
ustashi were making burek was discovered in Mirkovci," "Ante 
Markovic stole 28 kg of prosciutta from Uzice," "Even a little 
fellow is stronger than the embargo," "The wolf is lunching with 
Franjo," "Some 60 passengers were removed from the train and 
slaughtered in cornfields. The bodies still have not been 
found...."

journalist of the Belgrade newspaper DUGA, has evoked 
reflections about the risks of this profession, but also about 
the effectiveness of the police and the court system. In a brief 
police report marked "confidential" of the duty service of the 
SUP [Secretariat for Internal Affairs] for 11 April of this 
year, there is a statement that "on 9 April at 0100 hours 
Radislava Vujasinovic, born 10 February 1964 in Capljina, 
committed suicide with a bullet from a hunting rifle in the 
apartment of her parents in New Belgrade." The report goes on to 
say that the body was transferred to the Institute for Forensic 
Medicine for an autopsy by order of the investigating judge of 
the district court in Belgrade. 
  Meanwhile, there has been no official announcement, and the 
record of the inquest, we have learned, has been sent by the 
police to the district public prosecutor's office in Belgrade. 
The complete file should consist of the autopsy finding, a 
sketch of the scene of the event, photographs, and the report of 
the technical department on gunpowder traces ("the paraffin 
glove"). It has been learned that the prosecutor has asked the 
police for additional analysis in order to determine whether 
this was really a suicide or a crime (for example, forced 
suicide). A copy of the report also went to the Department for 
Violent and Sexual Crimes of the Belgrade SUP, whose inspectors, 
even before the order from the prosecutor's office, began to 
check out certain details. 
<H5>  A Lapse </H5>
  It is of interest that the inquest was not attended by the 
duty investigating judge of the district court, nor by the duty 
deputy district public prosecutor, which is a lapse sometimes 
difficult to make up for. It seems that in this case the police 
did not even inform the duty investigating judge, in spite of 
the fact that the death of a person well-known to the public was 
involved. Thus, room was created for suspicion and speculation, 
especially in the knowledge that Dada Vujasinovic had criticized 
many bigwigs in writing about the army, the police, crime, 
corruption, the war.... Many journalists, it is true, peacefully 
"cover" these topics without being tempted to threaten their own 
security. Dada Vujasinovic, however, took her job seriously. 
  The threats she had been receiving were also serious. One of 
the most characteristic was published in her article "The 
Survivors Will Be Innocent" (DUGA, No. 513, covering the period 
from 23 October to 5 November of last year). In the article, she 
writes clearly: 
  "I asked him nicely to comment on the wave of violence 
against well-off individuals. Unfortunately, the otherwise 
well-bred and accommodating people's deputy Raznatovic snapped 
back: `If you are interested in who is next, write that it is 
you and that I told you so.'" 
  Zeljko "Arkan" Raznatovic, former people's deputy, was not 
the only one: Dada Vujasinovic had been threatened by known and 
unknown, beginning with the anonymous thugs from Krajina who 
were bothered by her article about the arrest of Veljko Dzakula 
last fall, and going all the way to the "group of pilots" who 
sent her a threatening letter in which they charged that she 
contributed to the removal of General Bozidar Stevanovic, known 
as Mika Sprajs, former commander of the Air Force, who failed to 
become minister of the armed forces. Aside from threats which 
forced her to purchase a reinforced door (she lived alone), Dada 
Vujasinovic was also exposed to other types of pressures: 
Borisav Jovic, a top official in the SPS [Socialist Party of 
Serbia] and a former member of the SFRY [Socialist Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia] Presidency, filed a private complaint 
against her, allegedly because of slander. The trial was 
postponed several times, once even on grounds that "the judge 
had chicken pox" (!?), which drove the visibly upset Dada 
Vujasinovic to declare that one day she would sit in the front 
row when Borisav Jovic was tried for war crimes. 
<H5>  Debt </H5>
  One gets the impression that these pressures and the fact 
that what she wrote did not fit into the increasingly obvious 
"hyperpatriotic" changes in the editorial policy of DUGA 
certainly had an impact on Dada Vujasinovic. However, there was 
no indication in her behavior that she might be thinking about 
suicide. At this point, of course, nothing can be said with 
confidence, but it is of interest that her family did not 
publish a death notice, no speech was made at the funeral, and 
the funeral was conducted according to Orthodox custom. The 
family is silent for the present and waiting for the official 
version of the event, and in the editorial offices of DUGA there 
is uneasiness and fear. Many questions are being put: Who first 
entered the apartment, and how? Was anything taken from the 
apartment, and what? Did Dada Vujasinovic have documentation, 
and where is it? 
  Answers should be expected from the district public 
prosecutor's office, which is to judge whether there are grounds 
for possible initiation of an investigation, or whether it will 
confirm the original conclusion of the police. The Executive 
Committee of the Independent Association of Serbian Journalists 
has announced that it is calling upon the government to "make an 
investigation as soon as possible and make public all the 
circumstances which led to the tragic death of our colleague." 
The Democratic Party is also calling for light to be shed on 
this event, saying in its press release that this is not just a 
question of a legal obligation, but also a debt "to a journalist 
who dared to write about things others did not dare to write 
about." There is no need to emphasize that increasingly 
frightened individuals also expect the death of Dada Vujasinovic 
to be cleared up, and the shaken confidence in the rule of law 
might be restored at least a little provided the police and 
prosecutor's office do their job properly.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stojan Andov, chairman of the Assembly of </F>
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by Mirce Tomovski; 
place and date not given: "Permanent Nature of Democratic 
Changes"] 
  [Text] Stojan Andov, chairman of the Assembly of The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], discusses with 
PULS the Macedonian democratic political climate, elections, the 
division of power, interethnic relations, and so forth. 
  [Tomovski] This summer, the second free multiparty elections 
are scheduled for Macedonia. A short but significant period of 
time has elapsed since the first elections in developing a 
democratic environment in our country. It has been assessed in 
various ways: According to some, we are living in a time of 
radical democratic developments; according to others, the old 
still prevails, and what we have now is nothing but simulated 
democracy. What is your reaction to the democratic processes? 
  [Andov] The development of democratic processes in our 
country was determined by their nature. However, because of 
particular circumstances, they did not affect several areas. To 
begin with, the changes that occurred turned out to be so big 
and so significant that the political parties and their 
leaderships were unable to project any further programmatic 
development. Now, in a period of tremendous change in the 
history of the Macedonian people and of Macedonia as a state, 
there have been several minor programmatic changes made by the 
parties, although the foundations of society have radically 
changed. This is an indication that the new processes do not 
enjoy firm party and political support within the democratic 
infrastructure. Other problems may be found in the governmental 
institutions, the parliament, and so forth. Despite all the 
pressures and the great results it was able to achieve, 
considering the correlation of forces, obviously there was a 
certain area the parliament was unable to penetrate: Reform and 
reorganization of the administration of the state. The present 
administration meets the conditions that existed in a socialist 
society, at a time when Macedonia was, as a republic, a 
structural part of another state. There has been a substantial 
stagnation in the restructuring of the state. It should have 
been followed with its conversion to a developed market economy, 
privatization, reprivatization, denationalization, and so forth. 
  [Tomovski] Can you indicate more specifically the areas in 
which state reform is difficult to accomplish? 
  [Andov] To this day we do not have a Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs but a Ministry of Relations with Foreign Countries. Our 
classifications and legal resolutions still lack legal 
foundations for appointing ambassadors, replacing them, and so 
on. This is absurd, for the Constitution makes such decisions 
possible. We pointed out the reorganization of the Public 
Bookkeeping Service. However, the existing atmosphere surprised 
us: We did not see any understanding of the urgent need for the 
modern financial institutions. We raised this question with the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. It is inconsistent with today's 
demands and needs of society. From time to time it works 
according to the old system and acts in a way consistent with 
the time and the society of the past. Ignoring the Law on 
Financial Inspections and others, on a parallel basis, financial 
inspections are conducted at the Ministry of Police, which is 
totally against the law. We need a reorganization of state 
reserves, in accordance with our stance as an independent 
country. In my view, there is insufficient dynamism in terms of 
introducing changes and promoting democratic processes. This 
includes the media, which are failing to promote the basic 
features of democratic changes as was done at the start of 
pluralism, at the time when we were separating ourselves from 
Yugoslavia. They and the journalists display little feeling for 
the new, for taking a risk, and for achieving a breakthrough. 
This, however, may be naturally the result of the problems I 
mentioned. That is why the forthcoming elections will be a 
challenge to the political forces, to the forces pledged to a 
further democratic breakthrough, and to a stable executive power 
with a clear program. 
  [Tomovski] In a certain way the "103" elections became a 
test 
of what we may expect in the autumn. Or, at least, that is the 
way they are being interpreted. They are subject to the 
constant critical look of parties and candidates from the 
opposition, who participated in them. The criticism can be 
formulated as "the impossibility in Macedonia to win an election 
democratically." What are the democratic guarantees that will 
ensure fair play and a democratic struggle in the autumn? 
  [Andov] I would rather not discuss the objections voiced by 
the opposition. I know, however, from worldwide practical 
experience, that those who do not succeed keep interfering and 
criticizing, which is natural. Last summer there were 
disagreements about the electoral laws. There was even 
hostility toward those who did not think that the laws must be 
passed immediately and such individuals were even accused of not 
considering the good of the state and being opposed to the 
elections. That is why the government was right to revoke the 
draft laws and ensure the application of regular procedures. 
This offers us greater opportunities in terms of the Council of 
Europe, from which we asked for experts to assess our laws. The 
same request was made to several U.S. institutions. This is a 
guarantee that we shall pass laws providing for fair and free 
elections. On the basis of these laws we shall ask 
international observers to monitor the full elections. 
Otherwise, what happened in relation to the "103" was an attack 
on democracy, for methods alien to the democratic struggle were 
used. The representative of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian 
National Unity] openly threatened violence. Representatives of 
the Democratic Party used the method of unsubstantiated and 
one-sided statements concerning the various parties and attacked 
the integrity of individuals with a view to compromise them. A 
democratic electoral atmosphere must be one of struggle but a 
struggle for party programs, a struggle among the capabilities 
of the candidates and their intellectual and political power. 
  [Tomovski] However it is being pointed out to you that once 
again there are manipulations in the passing of laws, and the 
parliamentary session has been extended. All of this is in 
order to help the governmental coalition acquire better 
electoral conditions for itself. 
  [Andov] It was the parties that requested the extension. We 
have never had any greater cooperation and understanding among 
the parties about the laws as we do now. There have been many 
proposals and many suggestions. The new laws are now, virtually 
for the first time, being formulated in a real pluralistic 
atmosphere. I believe that we shall be able to pass real laws 
for free elections and a fair electoral struggle. 
  [Tomovski] Now that we are on the verge of elections it has 
been remarked, concerning the suggested model of proportional 
majority, that it will not provide a true political picture of 
Macedonia in the next parliament. 
  [Andov] In all countries the political picture remains 
within 
the framework of its basic purposes and needs at that specific 
period. If in the forthcoming period we need a stable authority 
in Macedonia, clearly we have no interest in letting a number of 
small parties enter parliament, with two or three 
representatives, and so on. For in that case it would be 
impossible to secure the existence of a legislative body with 
the required political weight needed to create a stable and 
responsible executive authority. We have about 60 political 
parties. Does anyone truly think that there are 60 real options 
for Macedonia? Therefore, this is a rustic, folkloric, carnival, 
country fair atmosphere rather than a true reflection of the 
need for political development of the state. 
  [Tomovski] The parliament is one of the key factors of 
parliamentary democracy. It is a member of the 
Interparliamentary Union. At the same time, however, the 
parliament is being constantly criticized by the public and by 
the political parties. What is its real position in terms of the 
two extremes in such assessments? 
  [Andov] I think that our parliament functions in accordance 
with European standards. The problems appeared wherever a 
two-thirds majority was required. I believe that the Assembly 
established itself as the central legislative and political 
institution in the period between the two elections. At the same 
time, it took all the steps required for the functioning of an 
independent state. The criticism on the part of the public is 
undifferentiated: It is more a criticism on the part of circles 
that would like the work to be done more rapidly and 
efficiently. However, they forget that the dynamics and 
efficiency of the work depend above all on the correlation of 
political forces. Another criticism comes from the 
nonparliamentary parties. They are displeased for being outside 
the parliament. In all countries such parties play no role in 
society. The fact that in Macedonia the opposite is taking place 
is probably the result of our inexperience and the fact that, 
according to some, they could not become members of parliament 
within the first electoral period was a mistake. 
  [Tomovski] What are the chances that the new basic laws that 
so far have not been passed by the parliament may be passed 
before the start of the new elections? 
  [Andov] I mentioned the administration of the state. This 
includes justice. I believe that despite all efforts it would be 
impossible in this parliament to rally 80 votes for any given 
project. It is impossible to have 80 votes, given the breakdown 
of political forces. 
  [Tomovski] Almost half of the townships in the Republic of 
Macedonia are not functioning for a variety of reasons. However, 
it is a fact that the people are having problems in their daily 
life. Yet the most important law on local self-government was 
not passed. 
  [Andov] Obviously, there are difficulties concerning the 
functioning of the townships given the absence of regulations in 
that area. The old regulations and statutory laws remain along 
with some government resolutions. However, there has been no 
definitive solution based on the Constitution. The law on local 
self-government was not passed. However, there are townships 
without a township assembly. Otherwise, all townships function 
one way or another. It would be better to pass a law on local 
self-government. It is obvious, however, that we have included 
in this law an excessive number of problems to be resolved. This 
includes interethnic relations. However, disputes concerning the 
law do not pertain to local self-government but to other issues 
which this law must resolve. Its passing was delayed by the 
government for a variety of disagreements, which point at the 
nature of the demands raised with the amendments. The government 
determined that the nature of the amendments makes an 80-vote 
majority impossible. 
  [Tomovski] Macedonia is developing its own original model of 
interethnic democracy. However, the political parties of the 
various nationalities are dissatisfied and are also the result 
of their internationalization. What is your view of Macedonian 
interethnic conditions? 
  [Andov] The main directions in resolving problems of 
interethnic relations are formulated in the Constitution and we 
do not have to exceed such frameworks or such methods in 
resolving them. There is no need for redefining interethnic 
relations. Those who think that by making statements abroad a 
somewhat different picture of the actual situation may be 
created are playing the wrong card. I believe that such problems 
are of no threat to Macedonia. 
  [Tomovski] According to the Constitution, the classical 
division of powers exists in Macedonia. How do you assess 
relations among the parliament, the head of state, and the 
government? 
  [Andov] I believe that a major step was taken with the 
constitutional resolutions according to which the executive 
power was granted to the government and the president. A more 
secure future and a more stable democratic development demand 
that some basic state interests be closely tied to the 
president's power. That is why we need a stronger presidential 
authority. This can be seen in other democratic countries as 
well. In my view, the present division of powers between the 
president and the government is not the best possible. Some 
changes must be made in the exercise of presidential power in 
order to achieve a better stability in the executive branch. 
This also means reciprocal responsibility. The parliament can 
and does have the right to replace the president. However, the 
possibility must be contemplated also of disbanding the 
parliament by the president. This would strengthen 
responsibility and the balance of power. Presently, the power is 
not balanced. At one point, the parliament made the president of 
the Republic equal to the parliamentarians. In my view there is 
no country in which one drags the name and the functions of the 
president in current party quarrels, involving ordinary demands. 
Respect must be shown for the institutions. The government is 
something different. Within this period of time the situation in 
Macedonia has somewhat changed, and we believe that this must be 
taken into consideration. 
  [Tomovski] Is this not in line with the criticism precisely 
of the fact that Macedonia is slowly abandoning the basic 
definition of parliamentary democracy and switching to a 
presidential system? 
  [Andov] A parliamentary democracy exists also wherever there 
is a presidential system. We cannot say that there is no 
parliamentary democracy in France today. A parliamentary 
democracy should not have any features of self-government and 
views about some kind of plebeian democracy, a democracy of the 
streets. Such a democracy cannot be considered a government. It 
cannot govern and administer the state. It may be of some 
importance but only in the course of establishment of the state. 
Otherwise, once it is established, there must be a variety of 
institutions with a variety of duties. 
  [Tomovski] The involvement of history in European political 
life is being condemned. However, of late efforts are being to 
patch former Yugoslavia together; an orthodox association is 
being created. This includes the intention of involving 
Macedonia. 
  [Andov] Europe and the rest of the world have tried 
everything possible in this area. They tried to have different 
states and in Croatia and Bosnia people started fighting and do 
not know how to stop it. The appearance of a variety of ideas 
cannot be blocked. It is quite important for the world to have a 
clear view of our position concerning each one of these ideas. 
We have proved, among others, that our withdrawal from former 
Yugoslavia indicates that this is a way of preventing the war. 
This proved that this was a right step to take. Of the current 
options available in Europe this proved to be the right one. 
That is why we should not be afraid of ideas expressing the 
despair of some circles. What matters is that we have a clear 
line well-known to the world. For the time being we are 
succeeding and I believe that we shall succeed in the future in 
making it known to all.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic </F>
and Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak by unidentified 
announcer in Zagreb on 11 May; from the "Picture Versus Picture" 
program -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] I am pleased to welcome Kresimir Zubak [Bosnian 
Croat leader] and [Croatian Foreign Minister] Mate Granic to our 
studio. Mr. Zubak, let me start by asking you about the four 
agreements that have been reached. The first agreement is about 
the president of the future Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
who will be a Croatian. Will you be the first president of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Zubak] Well, we did not discuss the persons who will be 
president, for instance the vice president, but we agreed that a 
Croatian will be the president during the first six months of 
the transitional period. According to the transitional 
provisions of the Federation's constitution, the constitution 
should be implemented within a period of six months. However, 
it is obvious that this period is too short and we are already 
behind schedule as far as the election of the Federation's 
president is concerned. We were supposed to elect the president 
of the Federation within 30 days but we did not reach a 
political agreement and that period was prolonged. Everything 
should be implemented within six months, but realistically this 
period will last a bit longer. However, we agreed that a 
Croatian would be the president over the initial six months. If 
the constitution of the Federation is not entirely implemented 
within this period, then the next president will be a 
Bosniak-Muslim. 
  We also agreed that the first president during the period 
after the Federal elections should be a Bosniak-Muslim. I would 
like to say that we signed the drafts of the documents today, 
and that the documents will we verified and signed as draft 
agreements on Saturday 14 May in Geneva. In this form of 
proposals, they will be offered for adoption to the 
constitutional parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Announcer] I would like to ask Croatian Foreign Minister 
Granic: What is your impression of this latest map of the 
internal political organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Does it 
appear to you that a good political compromise has been reached? 
  [Granic] A very good compromise; it is a huge step forward 
in 
the implementation of the Washington agreement. It is also a 
just one. This is a compromise that paves the way ahead. It 
benefits the Bosniak as well as the Croatian people, it benefits 
the federation. It also benefits our future confederal 
partners, the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia, as 
well as the whole world, has a great deal of interest in the 
materialization of this agreement. I can say, for example, that 
the United States' Madeleine Albright and Warren Christopher 
phoned several times during the day to ask about our progress. 
In any case, the agreement was met with a great deal of 
interest and satisfaction. All the more so, since it took place 
before Friday, before the talks in Geneva. Many things are 
clearer now. 
  [Announcer] I would like you to comment on the statement we 
heard tonight made by U.S. special envoy Redman, according to 
which the talks yielded a different result from what had been 
expected, but that this result is better. 
  [Granic] This refers to the formation of cantons six and 
seven, as they surely speed up the organization of the 
Federation. This is a great step forward. This obliterates 
some problems; for example, it is going to be far easier for the 
EU [European Union] to take over the town of Mostar. There will 
no longer be [word indistinct] problems. The EU intends to 
restore the town fast, to revive its life, to return its 
refugees. It will of course be the center of the canton, as Mr. 
Zubak said. Hence the fact that this agreement has been reached 
is of exceptional importance for Croatia. One should bear in 
mind that now policies will be coordinated. This is something 
which is already being carried out, not only as regards some 
individual current issues such as communications, refugees, and 
education, but many strategic issues, too. 
  [Announcer] Mr Zubak, these eight cantons we have seen, do 
they constitute those 58 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
territory with which the Croat-Muslim-Bosniak side jointly 
embarks on negotiations with the Serbian side. 
  [Zubak] This percentage does not include...[pauses] This 
also 
includes the area of the city of Sarajevo, about 3 percent of 
territory. Its special status ought to be under UN 
administration. Hence, the cantons account for 55 percent. 
  [Announcer] Apart from these four agreements, is there any 
agreement now on, is there a firm approach to negotiations with 
the Serbian side? 
  [Zubak] As you can see, having established the agreement on 
the external borders of the federation we departed from the 
following principle: In those areas where the Bosniak and the 
Croatian people are in the majority, they are really and 
objectively entitled to demand that those areas should be within 
our future commom state, our federation. We drafted such a 
territorial organization of the federation, which includes 58 
percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the proviso 
that it should be pointed out that not even this covers all 
those areas where these two peoples are in the absolute majority. 
  Let's take the example of Bijeljina: In total the Croatian 
and Bosniak population is in the majority, but these people have 
not been included in the federation. 
  [Announcer] Let's go back again to the second agreement out 
of the four, the agreement on the government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will be headed by a prime minister from 
the ranks of the Bosniak Muslim people, and out of its 17 
members, 6 will be Croatians. Does it mean at least 6 or up to 
6? 
  [Zubak] Well, you see, we came to a preliminary political 
agreement in Sarajevo to have a 15-member government, including 
the prime minister and his deputy. However, during the talks 
and negotiations in Vienna we came to the conclusion that it 
would be more opportune to have a 17-member government. As a 
result, we came to a new political agreement, under which 6 
government ministers would come from the ranks of the Croatian 
people. Since we agreed that the prime minister should come 
from the ranks of the Bosniak Muslim people, his deputy, under 
the constitution, will at the same time be the defense minister. 
In other words, the Croats have been given the right to 
nominate their candidate for this post. 
  We also agreed that another four ministers, including one 
without portfolio, should be from the ranks of the Croatian 
people. 
  Why is this necessary? We need this in order to ensure that 
the Croats are given the opportunity to realize their 
constitutional right of insisting, when they deem it necessary, 
that in other words one-third of the ministers will have the 
right to ask that, in the case of issues considered to be of 
vital importance, decisions be made through voting and 
consensus. It was therefore necessary to ensure that one-third 
of the government comprises Croatians, providing one of them is 
prime minister or rather deputy prime minister. 
  [Announcer] To continue in the same vein, can you tell us 
how 
the implementation of the agreement will proceed. 
  [Zubak] When we first of all signed the framework and then 
the entire agreement in Washington, various comments were made, 
various views and forecasts expressed, various expectations were 
voiced, about how the agreement could be implemented on the 
ground. Through organized political action we have succeeded in 
persuading and explaining to the people on the ground all the 
advantages of the agreement, that it is an historical necessity, 
that it will be instrumental in realizing all the political 
goals of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and of the 
Croatian people in general. With this approach we succeeded in 
persuading the people that this is the best solution and, at the 
current juncture, of historic importance for the Croatian 
people. I believe that through a politically synchronized and 
coordinated action we shall succeed in explaining and persuading 
the people, political officials, and leaders of the people that 
this solution -- the cantonal arrangement -- will serve the 
political and all other interests of the Croatian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  At the same time, the cantonal arrangement neither threatens 
nor questions the interests of the Bosniak people. In the areas 
where we failed to achieve greater territorial divisions, 
tensions between the two peoples would most likely have deepened 
if a solution had not been reached. We see this as a compromise 
that will make it impossible for either one or the other people 
to be outvoted. They are both absolutely equal and in such an 
atmsophere... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] In other words, you do not expect 
changes or problems on the ground? 
  [Zubak] Well, there will probably be resistance. However, as 
I said, through a synchornized, coordinated, and planned action, 
I think we will succeed in explaining and persuading the people 
that this solution is a good one. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Granic, a new ministerial conference is 
expected in Geneva on Friday in which America, Russia, the EU, 
and the United Nations are to take part. What is the importance 
of this agreement, its completion, and its signing, for further 
peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Granic] The picture now is more complete. In any case, it 
will help in achieving a final solution. Without this agreement 
the issue would have remained less clear. In light of this 
agreement, it is certain that the position of the United States, 
which has invested most to have this agreement reached, and of 
some other states, especially Germany, will be clearer in the 
search for a final solution. This means that the pressure on 
the Serbs will definitely be stronger. 
  [Announcer] What can we expect now? It seems that it is the 
Serbians in Bosnia-Herzegovina who are under greatest pressure. 
A fresh conference is being prepared, the Croats and Bosniak 
Muslims have reached an agreement. Do you feel that this is the 
turning point and that the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina is about 
to be solved? 
  [Granic] Well, in the light of our experience of many 
conferences, it is nevertheless realistic to expect that this 
will be the most serious of the meetings, that it has been 
approached seriously, and that it takes place with an agreement 
in place between the Bosniaks and the Croatians. In other 
words, preconditions exist for a serious conference. 
  I would like to add that, as far as the Republic of Croatia 
is concerned, this agreement will considerably strengthen the 
position of the Republic of Croatia, in particular in its 
negotiations with the international financial institutions, with 
the EU, and that in any case, this is yet another step further 
in strengthening Croatia's international position, since Croatia 
is seen here as a confederal partner. Of course, the 
negotiations were between the Croatians and the Bosniaks, Mr. 
Silajdzic and Mr. Zubak, but we are cosignatories of both the 
preliminary and the final Washington agreement. Accordingly, 
our responsiblity for implementing this agreement is great. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Granic and Mr. Zubak, thank you for taking 
part in this evening's edition of Picture versus Picture. I 
wish you a great deal of success in implementing the Vienna 
agreement.

  [Text] Knin, May 12 (TANJUG) -- The UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] spokesman for the Sector South M. Roberts said that the 
peacekeepers have started deployment Thursday [12 May] to take 
over full control of the demarcation line between the republic 
of Serb Krajina (RSK) and Croatia. 
  The RSK was declared in 1991 by the Serbs on their ethnic 
and 
historic lands in the former Republic of Croatia in response to 
the latter's forcible secession from former Yugoslavia and the 
downgrading of the Serbs in Croatia to a national minority. 
Since the spring of 1992 RSK has been declared a U.N. Protected 
Area (UNPA). 
  UNPROFOR troops have been sent to locations where some units 
of the conflicting sides still remain, Roberts told a regular 
press conference. This marks the beginning of the 
implementation of the Akashi-Martic agreement reached in talks 
held on May 9 in Knin. Under the agreement the remaining troops 
of the two sides should fully withdraw by May 20. Speakivg 
about Akashi's visit to Knin and his talks with the RSK 
leadership there Roberts confirmed that the U.N. special envoy 
was satisfied with the results of the talks and that he had the 
impression that great progress had been made in the last 15 days 
towards the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, reached 
on March 30 in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. 
  Roberts also pointed to the difficulties in clearing up the 
mines on the main communication links, as well as on local 
roads, and that it was still unsafe for the population to return 
to the villages in Ravni Kotari. People nevertheless come to 
inspect their houses and land and some have started clearing up 
the debris, he added. 
  Roberts said that special Canadian units with 35 experts 
would be dispatched to speed up the mine-clearing process and 
warned that the work could not be accomplished if both sides did 
not submit detailed maps of the mine fields. So far only the 
North Dalmatian Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army has done this, 
Roberts said adding that the maps supplied by the Croatian side 
were inaccurate. Since the beginning of the implementation of 
the cease-fire agreement the UNPROFOR has set up 69 observation 
posts along the 310-km long demarcation line in Sector South. A 
Jordanian battalion is now being deployed on Mt Velebit where 
observation posts already exist to monitor the cease-fire. The 
peacekeeprs are also setting up observation posts on Mts Dinara 
and Svilja.

  [Text] Belgrade, 12 May (TANJUG)--The command of the 18th 
Corps of the Serbian Army of Krajina [SVK] this evening denied 
any involvement by its soldiers in the brutal murders in the 
vicinity of Daruvar on 11 May. The Croatian side is accusing 
the Serbian army and Serbs in western Slavonia of having 
committed these murders. An official statement by the 18th 
Corps' command says: The corps' command was informed by 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] at 1800 on 12 May 1994 that a 
multiple murder had been committed. Five persons were killed 
and two others wounded in the village of Vukovije, northeast of 
Daruvar, at 2230 on 11 May. The corps' command expresses regret 
at this tragic event but vehemently denies any connection 
between corps' members and the incident in question. 
  By resorting to its well-known propaganda methods, the 
Croatian side is trying, yet again, to accuse the Serb 
side--before the investigation conducted by UNPROFOR and the 
Croatian police has been concluded. We believe that such 
conduct is not conducive to the building of trust necessary for 
the implementation of the cease-fire agreement, says the 
statement issued by the 18th Corps of the SVK.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Jakovcic, chairman of the Istrian </F>
Democratic Assembly, by Edi Jurkovic; place and date not given: 
"Istria Is Indeed for Croatia, but...."] 
  [Text] There are many reasons for talking with Ivan 
Jakovcic, chairman of the Istrian Democratic Assembly [IDS]. 
The course of events lately has unsettled relations between 
Zagreb and Istria. It began in mid-April with the foundation of 
the Council for Istria, that did not include the IDS 
representatives who had won the elections in Istria. 
Furthermore, the Statute of the Istrian County was annulled. 
In a very tense situation, with the media scrutinizing the 
situation through its magnifying glass, in late April the IDS 
organized an extraordinary convention of the party in Rovinj, at 
which heretical demands for a special, autonomous status for 
Istria were stated again. 
  [Jurkovic] How do you assess the new tension between Zagreb 
and Istria? 
  [Jakovcic] There are no changes in relations between 
official Zagreb and Istria. That is, the consistent policy of 
President Franjo Tudjman is proven to be so only by the example 
of Istria. From the 1990 electoral campaign up to now we have 
had a situation of continuous depreciation of the Istrian 
authorities -- represented by the Social Democratic Party 
before, and now by the IDS -- and the rejection of any 
initiative coming from Istria. 
  [Jurkovic] A different interpretation is also possible, that 
you are looking for bad blood beforehand. You condemned the 
foundation of the Council for Istria from the outset. 
  [Jakovcic] It is solely official Zagreb that is to blame for 
such relations between the central administration and Istria. I 
can prove this quite simply. In the referendum for independent 
and sovereign Croatia a great majority of the Istrian people had 
voted for it, just as they voted for the IDS in the elections. 
Which is to say, Istria is indeed for Croatia, but for a 
democratic Croatia, rather than for one ruled by the Croatian 
Democratic Community [HDZ]. 
  We have to give careful consideration to any initiative made 
by the state leadership, because any initiative by official 
Zagreb in these four years has been aimed at crushing the 
authorities in Istria, and causing disorder. It is not a 
coincidence that as many as three messages came from Zagreb -- 
first, there was the establishment of the Council for Istria, 
which I commented very cautiously, though it is not true that I 
rejected a priori the establishment of that council. I just 
wanted to have some latitude in order to see what it was all 
about. Immediately thereafter the Statute was annulled -- 
actually it happened on the same day. And thirdly, we received 
at the same time the message from the parliament's highest 
officials that the problem of Istria may as well be settled by 
the police, the army, or the executive boards. Of course, such 
an attitude already verges upon totalitarian methods, which we 
have to condemn. 
  [Jurkovic] How would you comment the assessment, which I 
personally hold to be true, that the HDZ and IDS work according 
to the principle of two vessels linked together, so that 
pressure applied by HDZ strengthens the IDS, and vice versa. In 
concrete terms, does the IDS have any use for the actions taken 
by the HDZ? 
  [Jakovcic] Neither Istria nor the IDS can make any use of 
the attacks by the HDZ, or steps taken by President Tudjman, 
because any straining of relations between Istria and official 
Zagreb in no way benefits Istria, nor, therefore, Croatia as a 
whole. The suspension of democracy that is being announced 
means "good night" to Croatia. The HDZ, which is thus making 
internal enemies, follows the logic: Divide et impera [divide 
and rule]. It wants to divide the citizens of Croatia in order 
to be able to control them more easily. Of course, Istria will 
resist this, because we want to be fully present in the Croatian 
political life with our principles. That is the problem that 
our dispute is about. 
  [Jurkovic] Will the IDS agree to take part in the activities 
of the Council for Istria after all that has been said these 
days? 
  [Jakovcic] In view of the current circumstances I do not see 
any possibility of the IDS representatives' taking part in the 
Council's work. Still, I cannot foresee what the County 
Assembly will decide. 
  To say that the Council will be engaged in economic, 
cultural, or similar matters means to suspend the county's 
leadership, and indirectly the Croatian government, because that 
is a job of the executive bodies. After all, I may well feel 
that the Council is an attempt to create parallelism and 
overthrow the authorities, but what I really want to feel is 
that it is a council that would make suggestions to the 
president to reconsider an appropriate status for Istria, in 
view of all the events, the election results, the mood among the 
citizens, and Istria's surroundings. That would be a positive 
advance, and we might possibly discuss our joining the Council. 
  [Jurkovic] In addition to the Council the relations are 
tensed also because of the annulment of the Statute of the 
Istrian county, for which you said recently that it was the 
minimum of what Istria wanted. 
<H5>  We Are Defending Our Country's Reputation </H5>
  [Jakovcic] Firstly, the Statute is in compliance with the 
Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, and we shall prove this 
at the Constitutional Court, and show that Istria absolutely 
observes Croatia's legislation. Of course, the Statute is not 
an expression of the political will of Istria's citizens, for 
neither the country's system, nor the legislation are an 
expression of the will of Istria's citizens. You remember how 
we struggled in the parliament to change the bill on the 
territorial organization of the Republic of Croatia, so that the 
territory could be organized according to the historic regions, 
but our efforts failed. The Statute is not an expression of the 
political attitudes of the IDS, because we demand that Croatia 
be regionalized in such a way that the regional assemblies are 
given the legislative and governing authority. We see modern 
Croatia as a country of regions founded on the tradition of 
Stjepan Radic's [Croatian politician, assassinated in 1926 
because he supported independent Croatia] constitution that 
read, let me quote: "Counties must adopt regulations, of a 
quality equal to that of laws." Another buttress of our 
regionalism is the European standard of organizing regions. 
That is a condition sine qua non [necessary condition] of the 
IDS activities. 
  [Jurkovic] It is precisely your advocating Europe that is 
disputable. For instance, you are being reproached for having 
taken a copy of the bill on the constitutional law on Istria 
with you to Geneva without the knowledge of the Foreign 
Ministry. How did that happen, and why? 
  [Jakovcic] Firstly, the IDS defends the Croatian reputation 
in the world wherever it goes, and this we can rightfully prove 
by documents, deeds, our struggle for minorities' rights, for 
the freedom of media, for private ownership, for individual 
freedom. Since we are an eminent regional party, we are quite 
respected in Europe, so we were invited to the European 
Parliament and the Council of Europe. The delegation of the 
Council of Europe will visit Croatia soon, including us as well. 
The IDS has a right to be politically active on the European 
political stage in its own way. As for your question, it should 
be said that no move has been made without previously having 
informed the Croatian authorities of our demands, because we do 
nothing behind their back, before we inform either the president 
or the Government of our intentions. We discuss everything in 
the Assembly, while the fact that some eminent European 
politicians, being familiar with the power structure in Croatia, 
show interest in talking directly with the IDS is something else. 
  [Jurkovic] Let us further discuss the disputed bill. As 
early as in September 1993 the bill was discussed for the first 
time, while at the party convention in Rovinj it was brought 
into the focus of attention again. What is the document about? 
  [Jakovcic] The bill was worked out following the experience 
and practice of European regionalism, which means that the 
County Assembly is to be given legislative and governing 
authority. It involves also the apportionment of revenue, 
where, if it were organized as we have envisaged, one-third 
would suffice for the state, while two-thirds of the revenue 
would remain in the region. 
  [Jurkovic] Ivan Herak has recently stated that President 
Tudjman, when he learned about the program, agreed to the 
possibility that two-thirds of the revenue should remain in the 
region, as a pilot-program for economic autonomy, but he did not 
want to hear about the county's having legislative authority. 
Can you confirm this, since you have talked with the president 
yourself? 
  [Jakovcic] Either Mr. Herak is lying, or Tudjman has 
really changed his stance. I am not familiar with such an 
assessment, but I would really be glad if the situation were so. 
I believe that many relations would be different if such a 
political will, in favor of apportioning the revenue, existed. 
Still, it seems to me that Herak improvised [as published] the 
statement, because such an apportionment means consequently the 
apportionment of authority. We cannot expect the government to 
get smaller, and to pay for everything else. Therefore it is 
clear that his statement is not true. 
<H5>  Fear of Totalitarianism </H5>
  [Jurkovic] All right then, but would you still explain why 
the constitutional law is again being insisted upon? 
  [Jakovcic] Because it is natural that the Croatian Assembly 
should adopt the bill on the regional organization of Croatia, 
or at least adopt it with regard to certain regions. It is also 
natural that our current status cannot be as the IDS would wish 
it to be, because no corresponding constitutional law exists, 
and therefore the Bill has been worked out in compliance with 
the existing regulations. Constitutional law is a normal 
legislative form in the industrialized democratic states, by 
which certain regions are given their own authorities and 
statuses within a particular state. 
  [Jurkovic] Does it mean that you shall propose the same to 
the Assembly? 
  [Jakovcic] Yes, when we decide that it is necessary. 
  [Jurkovic] Still, it is unrealistic that the proposal would 
pass in the Assembly, so would you explain what a participant at 
the IDS convention meant when he speculated what would happen if 
the proposal was rejected in the Assembly? 
  [Jakovcic] Any policy, if it is wise, brings about actions 
that benefit the citizens it represents. I believe that our 
party will be taking such actions, so that it will propose the 
constitutional law at the moment when we estimate it could win 
the majority of votes. However, in order for a referendum to be 
announced some really dramatic moments should occur. 
  [Jurkovic] What dramatic moments? 
  [Jakovcic] I refer to a possible deviation of official 
Croatian policy toward totalitarianism. Then the IDS would 
decide to follow a quixotic path, doomed in advance to fail in 
the Assembly, but then that would be an ultimate expression of 
our political stance, that the will of the Istrian voters is to 
be respected. If Croatia diverts to dictatorship, which is 
mentioned as a possibility also by some former aides of the 
president, the question is what methods the IDS will go for. 
They will be democratic in any case, while the referendum is 
the most democratic method. 
  [Jurkovic] A new dimension to Istria's political position 
has been brought about by the general elections in Italy. The 
statements by the winners that the Osimo agreements [made in the 
1970's, by which relations between Italy and the Socialist 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the fields of politics, 
economics, minority rights, and so forth, were defined] ought to 
be revised, have brought about much apprehension in Croatia. 
How would you comment on all that? 
  [Jakovcic] The Italian political scene has been overwhelmed 
by statements, some of which were not at all serious, but I 
would not say that they are dangerous for the Croatian 
sovereignty, because neither Istria nor Dalmatia accept any 
revision of the state borders. I have to say that it is normal 
that in any state there are those who dream about greater Italy, 
greater Serbia, or greater Croatia. Fortunately enough, such 
people are marginal. I am deeply convinced of Italy's 
democratic orientation and I believe that the new Italian 
government will also be one of the pillars of democratic Europe, 
following the principles of the Helsinki and the Maastricht 
convention. 
  The Lega Nord, being the leading Italian party, was first to 
dissociate itself from the statements by neofascists. The 
relations between the IDS and the Lega Nord are quite correct, 
and we intend to cultivate them further. The Lega Nord was the 
first party in Italy to state clearly and vociferously as early 
as in 1991 their support for the independence of Croatia, and to 
visit, I think, minister Separovic. By the agency of Lega Nord 
we shall insist that Croatia and Slovenia be admitted to the 
European institutions as soon as possible, and we believe that 
in such terms the IDS can considerably help Croatian foreign 
policy. Whether our Foreign Ministry will be wise and make good 
use of us, I do not know, but that would be quite a prudent 
thing to do. 
  [Jurcevic] In your relations with Italy the most disputed 
matter are the Osimo agreements, their revision. What is your 
attitude in that regard? 
  [Jakovcic] The Osimo agreements are a complex matter, 
regulating many things, but what is important is that they 
closed the history book in this region by definitely fixing the 
boundaries, and this is irrevocable. However, the agreements 
deal with many other things as well, for instance, with the 
property of refugees (esula), the protection of the Italian 
ethnic minority, economic cooperation, the traffic of goods and 
people, and those are clauses that require amendments, because 
they have not been implemented. It is only that part where we 
can talk about a revision of the agreement, of course in the way 
that friendly neighbors would do it. 
<H5>  Istrianism Is Reality </H5>
  [Jurcevic] In addition to that there is a fear that some 
people's declaring themselves as Istrians benefits the 
Italianization of Istria. Generally, that designation is 
disputed, yet Istrianism is protected also by the Statute of the 
County. 
  [Jakovcic] Today, Istrianism is very much an explicit 
reality in Istria, and it is impossible to estimate in which way 
it would manifest itself further. Nobody can ignore the fact 
that in the 1991 census some 40,000 people declared themselves 
as Istrians. That has nothing to do with the Italianization of 
Istria, but rather with the awakened regional identity among the 
people who have suppressed their national being, and accepted a 
geo-ethnic relation they have with the region they are living 
in, so they feel that Istria is their micro-fatherland. 
  [Jurcevic] Do you think that the Istrians are a people in 
their own right? 
  [Jakovcic] They are what each of them feels to be. A 
people, or a deception -- you can understand it whichever way 
you will. It is too early now to assess that phenomenon. It 
should be analyzed by serious, competent people, while 
politicians would only bring in too much passion, so I would not 
like to interpret what happened in the past census without an 
expert analysis, which will have to be made anyway. 
  [Jurcevic] An extraordinary convention of the IDS was held 
recently in Rovinj. How do you assess it? 
  [Jakovcic] We have adopted four declarations that give 
operative strength to the party's platform, and precisely 
determine attitudes regarding the democratization and 
regionalization of Croatia, the autonomy of the Istrian county, 
and Istria as a European region. These are documents that 
clearly show to all those who expected us to subvert Croatian 
sovereignty, that they have ended up with the short end of the 
stick. What I, personally, find particularly bothersome is that 
some distinguished Croatian politicians speculated about the 
convention in Rovinj, thinking out various scenarios of how it 
would eventually end up. 
<H5>  A Right of Herak and Martincic </H5>
  [Jurcevic] It is interesting that your declarations have 
been severely attacked even by the colleagues in the regional 
RIDS [extension not known], that heads the Association of 
Regional Parties of Croatia [ARSH]. They say that your 
declarations are preposterous, improper, a sheer provocation.... 
  [Jakovcic] The colleagues in RIDS have many times made very 
strange assessments on the IDS attitudes, and I have to add that 
when we had the most difficult time, the most difficult problems 
to deal with, they deliberately sided with those who wanted to 
crush our party for personal reasons. Whether the RIDS wanted 
to stamp out the ARSH will be shown in the course of time, but I 
have to tell you that I am less and less bewildered by their 
reactions. Although I am a great supporter of talks, I think 
that the room for cooperation with them is getting narrower and 
narrower. 
  [Jurcevic] Does that attitude of yours call into question 
the ARSH as well? 
  [Jakovcic] I think that the ARSH may become well established 
in the Croatian political space, if democratic processes prevail 
in it in such a way that each party acts autonomously, rather 
than -- as was the case -- to let RIDS impose its attitudes 
regarding the resolution of the situation in our party. I think 
that the RIDS has to take serious care of what is to be done 
further. 
  [Jurcevic] With respect to your party's convention, and 
the turbulence that occurred within the party not so long ago, 
how do you explain the legalization of factions within the party? 
  [Jakovcic] As for the functioning of the IDS in factions, 
that was my idea from the very day when the problems in personal 
relations broke out in the party. However, those who wanted to 
overthrow Delbianco and me did not want to accept the idea. 
Debeljuh's initiative to allow factions has come about somewhat 
late, but nevertheless, it is a constructive and well-meant 
initiative, so we shall set up criteria for the factional 
organization of the party. In that way we shall increase the 
degree of democracy. I have immediately asked Debeljuh to take 
part in The Parties' Club on Croatian television, because he is 
entitled to that, representing, as he does, a future faction. 
  [Jurkovic] Finally, I would like you to comment on the 
announcement of the foundation of Istria's new party by former 
IDS members, namely Herak and Elio Martincic. 
  [Jakovcic] To found a new party is their democratic right. 
One should pay attention to their platform and what they offer 
to the voters. For the time being the attitude of the IDS is 
neutral.

<F P=106> [Unattributed HINA article: "Croatia Has Citizens, Not the </F>
Istria Zupanija"] 
  [Text] Minister of Administration Davorin Mlakar on 
the reasons for initiating proceedings to assess the 
constitutionality of the zupanija statute; many provisions of 
the Istria Zupanija's statute regulate issues which, on the 
basis of the Constitution and the law, are only within the 
state's purview; the zupanija does not have the right to 
introduce another official language; the Republic of Croatia has 
citizens, while the zupanijas have residents. 
  Zagreb--So far the Ministry of Administration has received 
most of the zupanija statutes. Of the 12 statutes analyzed to 
date, in the statute of the Istria Zupanija the ministry has 
identified many provisions in conflict with the Constitution of 
the Republic of Croatia and the law. As a result, implementation 
of that statute has been halted, and at the proposal of the 
Ministry of Administration, the government has initiated 
proceedings before the Constitutional Court to assess its 
constitutionality and legality. 
  According to the words of Minister of Administration Davorin 
Mlakar, many provisions of the Istria Zupanija's statute 
regulate issues which, on the basis of the Constitution and the 
law, are only within the state's purview. Thus, Mlakar stated, 
that statute violates several laws, such as, for instance, the 
Law on Local Self-Government and Administration, the Law on the 
Areas of Zupanijas, Cities, and Municipalities, the Law on 
Health Care, the Law on Industrial Ownership, and other separate 
laws. 
  "We believe that provisions of the Constitution have also 
been violated, and we therefore proposed to the government that 
proceedings be initiated before the Constitutional Court to 
assess the constitutionality and legality of the Istria 
Zupanija's statute. The specific result of our work is only that 
we have stopped that statute from being implemented, and that it 
is not possible to act in accordance with it, nor can general 
acts that would cite it be adopted. It is up to the 
Constitutional Court to adopt the final decision and say whether 
we were right or not," Mlakar said. 
<H5>  Violated Regulations </H5>
  As an example of inconsistency with the Constitution and the 
laws, Minister Mlakar cited article 13 of the statute, which 
provides that the Istria Zupanija independently adopts 
regulations in specific legal areas. "That means, in other 
words, that it can adopt regulations in areas for which separate 
laws provide that they are to be adopted by the Assembly of the 
Republic of Croatia," Mlakar said. He explained that with the 
independent adoption of regulations, the Zupanija is 
establishing its jurisdiction in violation of the provisions of 
article 128 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and 
articles 13, 14, and 15 of the Law on Local Self-Government, as 
well as the provisions of the Law on Specifying Matters Within 
the Self-Governing Jurisdiction of Units of Local 
Self-Government and Administration. "That means that three 
fundamental regulations have been violated by that norm in the 
statute. Thus, for example, article 7 of the Law on Local 
Self-Government and Administration regulates the content of the 
zupanija statutes and states definitely what should be regulated 
by the zupanija statute, and no general act can go beyond that 
legal norm and remain consistent with the law," Mlakar 
emphasized. 
  Next, he stated that contrary to the Constitution's 
provisions, article 13 of the Zupanija statute prescribed that 
the Zupanija independently adopts regulations governing the 
status of employed personnel. Specifically, article 54 of the 
Constitution prescribes the right to work and freedom of work as 
one of the economic, social, and cultural rights, and article 56 
of the Constitution establishes that employees' rights to social 
security and insurance are regulated by law and a collective 
contract. That means, according to Mlakar, that employees' 
status anywhere, including in the Zupanija's bodies, is 
regulated solely by law and a collective contract. 
<H5>  Use of Language </H5>
  Article 15 of the statute, which, as Mlakar stated, says 
that 
the Zupanija has decentralization as the principle of its own 
structure, and that it formulates administrative procedure on 
the basis of the principles of simple and public operation, is 
contrary to articles 18, 19, and 88 of the Croatian 
Constitution, since the Zupanija does not have the 
constitutional or legal right to formulate administrative 
procedure. "On the basis of the above-mentioned constitutional 
provisions, it is exclusively the Assembly's right, because the 
working methods of state bodies and units of local 
self-government can only be regulated by law," Minister Mlakar 
said. 
  He also warned about article 16 of the statute, which 
establishes the possibility of changing the area and 
headquarters of the Istria Zupanija. "The areas and headquarters 
are determined by the Law on the Areas of Zupanijas, Cities, and 
Municipalities in the Republic of Croatia, and can only be 
changed in the manner prescribed by the law. That cannot be 
transferred by any means to a lower unit, or to lower general 
acts," Mlakar specified. 
  He added that the statute also regulates the introduction of 
another language, in addition to Croatian, for official use. 
That right, by law, is only exercised by units of local 
self-government--municipalities, cities, and districts--which 
can decide in their general acts that a minority language can 
also be in official use, along with the Croatian language and 
the Latin alphabet. The Zupanija, Mlakar emphasized, does not 
have that right, because according to the Constitution and the 
laws it is a unit of local administration and self-government. 
  Article 1 of the statute only cites precise provisions of 
the 
Constitution, and thus says that "The Istria Zupanija is a unity 
of local self-government and administration, within the 
framework of the united and indivisible Republic of Croatia." 
With the opposite order, which is not unimportant (because it 
should say "unit of local administration and self-government"), 
Mlakar pointed out that certain attributes of the state are also 
left out, because according to article 131 of the Constitution, 
the Republic of Croatia is a united, indivisible, democratic, 
and social-welfare state. 
<H5>  Citizens' Rights </H5>
  The statute says that the Istria Zupanija is a unit of local 
self-government and administration of all of its citizens, and 
that the Zupanija protects the freedoms and rights of its 
citizens. That is a right that is only exercised by the state, 
Mlakar warned. "Only the Republic of Croatia has citizens, and 
units of local self-government, municipalities, and cities have 
residents. Consequently, zupanijas do not have their own 
citizens; they are exclusively citizens of the Republic of 
Croatia and it guarantees them all civil rights and freedoms and 
human rights. That is a right reserved for the state alone, and 
in comparison with other countries' constitutions, one can reach 
the same conclusion--it cannot be left to the units of local 
administration and self-government to protect citizens' rights 
and freedoms, because that could ultimately mean that they could 
be protected differently," Mlakar said. 
  "We are not disputing a single one of those citizens' 
rights, 
and we are not questioning that part, but instead we are 
maintaining--and we have a basis for doing so in the 
Constitution and the laws--that these are rights that are 
exclusively within the state's purview. The state has specified 
by laws which form and part of legal regulations it will leave 
to the zupanijas, and which part the state, in order to 
guarantee the equality and rights of citizens before the law and 
the Constitution, will regulate uniformly for the entire 
territory of the Republic of Croatia," Minister Mlakar concluded.

<F P=106> [Article by Vlastimil Stana: "Air Force and Air Defense in </F>
the Next Century"] 
  [Text] Part of the change in the Czech Army is the 
transformation of the Air Force and Air Defense [PVO]. This 
complicated operation, which certainly will not take place 
without some radical cuts, and thus also some scars on the face 
of the Air Force and PVO, is the consequence of the changed 
strategic conditions and the real reduction of resources 
earmarked for the Army. All the changes that the Air Force and 
the PVO are currently undergoing are not the last ones. Already 
in existence are plans for the look of the department in about 
1995, and concepts for the look of the Czech Air Force in the 
next century are also known. This was discussed at a news 
conference by Pavel Strubl, Air Force inspector and PVO general. 
<H5>  New Command System </H5>
  One of the substantive changes is the creation of a 
three-step system of command. Basically it is composed of the 
staff of the Air Force and the PVO of the Army of the Czech 
Republic [ACR], which handles not only organization and command, 
but also formulates the concept and plans for the future 
development of the department. Established as operational steps, 
designed primarily for the immediate command of the units, were 
the 3d Tactical Air Corps with its command headquarters in 
Hradec Kralove, and the 4th PVO Corps (Stara Boleslav). The 
active component is represented by the Air Force squadrons and 
PVO units. Among the largest in the Air Force is the 31st 
Tactical Air Force Base (ZTL) in Caslav, the 32d ZTL base in 
Namest nad Oslavou, the 33d Helicopter Base in Prerov, and the 
34th Air Force Training Base in Pardubice. The PVO corps is 
composed of the 4th Interceptor Aircraft base in Ceske 
Budejovice and the antiaircraft missile brigades and regiments 
located in Drnov, Brno, Ostrava, Rozmital pod Tremsinem, 
Kromeriz, and Strakonice. 
<H5>  Changes in the Air Force </H5>
  On the basis of analyses and after weighing the human, 
financial, and material possibilities, the General Staff worked 
out a concept for the development of the Air Force and the PVO 
up to the year 2005. 
  In the case of the Air Force, it is assumed that this year 
there will be a radical reduction in aircraft inventory, and 77 
fighter planes, 11 combat helicopters, 20 trainers, 10 transport 
and special planes, and 20 transport helicopters will be taken 
out of commission. Altogether, this will reduce the aircraft 
inventory by a full 30.6 percent! Next year the Air Force will 
be located at six airfields, and subsequently will have five 
permanent airfields at its disposal. The total number of 54 
existing airfields will be reduced to 29. In addition to the 
five permanent ones, seven airfields will be occupied by airport 
administrations, nine airfields will have paved runways, and 
eight will have grassy surfaces. 
  The plans also include changes in the equipment of the Air 
Force. Two bases, those in Caslav and Namest, would have 
subsonic planes L-159 of Czech manufacture and supersonic 
multipurpose planes. In connection with this we learned that as 
of this year there are no more plans to operate MiG-29's, or to 
make any further purchases of Russian equipment. The 
multipurpose supersonic plane is definitely going to be a plane 
of Western manufacture. But it is premature to talk about the 
precise type of plane. The air transport base (Praha-Kbely) 
would be equiped with large-capacity long-range jets to provide 
passenger service for government officials, and with mid-range 
planes (for example, Hercules) designed to transport people, 
materiel, and paratroopers, including the rapid deployment 
brigade. Also available would be small-capacity mid-range planes 
(for example, L-610). The Prerov base, in addition to the 
helicopters, would be home to propeller planes Z-142, subsonic 
L-39's, and L-159's. The modernization of the air force will 
begin this year with the purchase of Z-142's. 
<H5>  Future of the PVO </H5>
  Basic changes will take place above all in the combat and 
operational use of the signal, antiaircraft missile, and 
interceptor aircraft units. First of all, positional defense of 
installations will be abolished and replaced by defense of 
important regions, with the possibility of concentrating forces 
in the main operational direction. 
  There will be not only organizational changes in the PVO, 
but 
also reductions in the number of people and garrisons and an 
overall reduction in the cost of operations. The readiness 
system of the Czech Republic will thereafter be secured only by 
the signal corps and the interceptor aircraft units. 
  The current equipment of the PVO should serve until the year 
2010, the equipment of the signal corps until the year 1998.

<F P=106> Interview with Lieutenant Colonel Josef Prokes by Vladimir </F>
Marek; place and date not given: "Putting on a Beret Is Not 
Enough"] 
  [Text] The Chrudim mechanized airborne battalion 
should become one of the main pillars of the readiness brigade. 
This was the reason we asked its commanding officer, Lieutenant 
Colonel Josef Prokes, for an interview. 
  [Marek] Only recently you were the commander of the 71th 
airborne battalion. Without having to change places, you became 
practically overnight the commander of the 43d mechanized 
airborne brigade. What is the difference between these two units? 
  [Prokes] I would rather begin with what the two brigades 
have 
in common. They are located in Chrudim and they are airborne 
units. But they differ in their character and mission. The new 
brigade will be, as is, after all, indicated by its name, an 
airborne unit. It will therefore be possible to deploy it by 
parachute drop. But at the same time it also will be mechanized, 
which indicates its other possible insertion into combat--on 
personnel carriers. 
  [Marek] Will there be some difference in the training of the 
unit presently being formed compared to the former airborne 
battalion? 
  [Prokes] There will be no substantive difference in 
training. 
In certain areas the content will be changed. But these will be 
relatively small changes. 
  [Marek] Speaking about the names--isn't it a pity that the 
71st battalion, which already has its own tradition, its image, 
is being renamed the 43d? 
  [Prokes] I agree with you, it is a pity. Number 71 has its 
own history, which goes back to World War II. We were interested 
in having it at least appear under its historic name. But in 
view of the reorganization and renumbering of the entire army it 
was impossible for our wish to be granted. 
  [Marek] You mentioned that the brigade is mechanized. What 
kind of equipment will it have? 
  [Prokes] Primarily wheeled, unarmored vehicles. 
  [Marek] What would these be at present? 
  [Prokes] For the time being, mainly UAZ all-terrain 
vehicles. 
Before long, however, we should be getting new equipment. 
Mentioned are Mercedes and other latest generation all-terrain 
vehicles. 
  [Marek] At the present time the battalion is being 
transformed and provided with additional troops. Will you be 
able to start training by 1 July 1994? 
  [Prokes] Basically, training was never interrupted, it goes 
on in perfect continuity. The battalion is merely being 
supplemented with additional servicemen. The deadlines for 
forming the unit are relatively short. However, I am convinced 
that we can meet them. 
  [Marek] Can you envision a situation when the parliament 
decides, for example in six months, to deploy the brigade in 
some combat mission? Would you be able to handle it? 
  [Prokes] As I said already, the brigade will be formed by 1 
July. We shall meet that deadline. 
  [Marek] Are you satisfied with the quality of the people you 
are getting? Are they real professionals? 
  [Prokes] Most of the additional people we are getting have 
served in functions commensurate with those to which they are 
being assigned. The problem could be only in the fact that 
someone was, for example, a commander of a motorized rifle 
platoon and now he will command paratroopers. When we place a 
beret on an officer's head, it does not mean that he 
automatically becomes a paratrooper. He will have to learn some 
things. But if the person is only a little competent and has 
certain prerequisites, that should not present any great 
problems. 
  [Marek] Are these people in sufficiently good physical 
condition? 
  [Prokes] That is an individual matter. However, the majority 
of platoon commanders are young people who are in appropriate 
physical condition. 
  [Marek] Do you try to make the training as interesting as 
possible, make it as close to real combat conditions as possible? 
  [Prokes] It's not that we are trying. It is one of the basic 
principles which we have been following for a long time. There 
is much greater interest among the soldiers in that kind of 
training. When you are interested in what you are doing, it is 
much more effective than if it is merely something you are 
ordered to do. 
  [Marek] How many times a year, for example, does a soldier 
fire a submachine gun? 
  [Prokes] There is no firing range in Chrudim, and that is 
causing us some problems. We have to travel to one. In spite of 
that, our soldiers have the opportunity to fire at least once or 
twice every month. 
  [Marek] Do you also practice reflexive firing? 
  [Prokes] For the time being, the rules do not make it 
possible for us to do that. But if there should be a change, 
such practice should be interesting and useful.

  Turkish President Demirel called President Izetbegovic over 
the phone, congratulating him on reaching an accord to establish 
the Bosniak-Croatian federation. Turkey believes that this is a 
very important step toward peace which should in the future 
engage the Serbian side also, said President Demirel, promising 
that his country would continue to mediate in all initiatives 
and actions that lead toward the end of bloodshed and 
destruction of this country's economic base.

<F P=106> [Interview with Edhem Bicakcic, member of the Bosniak </F>
delegation at the Vienna talks, by Amir Hodzic in Vienna; date 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Hodzic] Mr. Bicakcic, how much territory will the 
federation cover -- its borders have been set -- and, 
percentage-wise, how many people will it include? 
  [Bicakcic] This issue -- establishing the external borders 
of the federation -- was one of the easier issues, and the 
Bosniak and Croatian delegations relatively quickly reached an 
agreement on it. The territory of the federation covers 58 
percent of the territory of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
including the 3 percent of the Sarajevo district territory. 
  On this territory the Bosniaks and the Croats are in the 
majority, which means that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly's 
decision that territories with majority Bosniak and Croatian 
populations should be included in the federation, has been 
followed to the letter. Apart from the 58 percent of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, the Croatian and the Bosniak 
delegations also expressed an interest in places that would 
remain under the Serbian aggressor's occupation where Bosniaks 
and Croats were in the majority. These are larger cities such 
as Bosanski Petrovac, Bosanska Gradiska, Bosanska Dubica, 
Bijeljina, Janja, and [word indistinct], which cannot be covered 
by the federation territory, but -- in future negotiations, when 
they take place -- we will try to obtain from the Serbian 
aggressor the protection of human rights for the population in 
these areas.

  [Text] Jagodina, 12 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the republic of Srpska assembly, said this evening 
that the republic of Srpska rejected the Vienna agreement 
between the Muslims and Croats, by which they were asking for 58 
percent of the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "This is a provocation and a form of pressure by the Muslims 
and their overlords and is out of the question," Krajisnik said 
in a statement for Radio Jagodina. "Whatever is over 50 percent 
of the territory--regardless of quality--is out of the 
question," he specified. 
  "Percentages--how much territory everyone will get--depend 
on 
numerous elements in this struggle and these divisions," 
Krajisnik stressed. "Without maps, everything is an auction and 
pressure." "I cannot see where the Muslims and Croats got the 
idea that they are entitled to so much territory, they simply 
cannot lay claim to it--they are neither military nor moral 
victors--unless some of their mentors want this in order to 
monitor the Serbs more easily," Krajisnik underlined. 
  Commenting on tomorrow's Geneva meeting, Krajisnik said: 
"There might be some results because this high-level gathering 
will also include those who want peace in these regions." 
  "Some other forces want war in the case of Brcko, and they 
are instigating the Muslims and Croats; if it were not for Brcko 
they would have passed a resolution that we would oppose and 
would thus have rekindled the war," Krajisnik said. "Posavina 
is of vital importance for the national interest of the Serbian 
people and there is no such force that could occupy it." 
  "We were embittered at our assembly in Brcko because of 
Muslim shelling--we had let them pass through our territories so 
many times, we had forgiven and yielded so much, they could have 
displayed at least a semblance of respect during the assembly, 
at least toward civilians and the innocent," Krajisnik 
underlined.

  [Text] Brcko, 11 May (TANJUG) -- At its 40th session held 
on 10-11 May in Brcko, the people's assembly of the Srpska 
republic [RS] adopted conclusions in which it defines the 
platform of the RS at future peace talks, advocating the 
cessation of hostilities, equal treatment of the RS, and 
elimination of pressure on the Serbs, including sanctions. The 
following are the conclusions of the RS assembly: 
  1. The platform on further moves of the RS delegation at 
peace talks, which the RS people's assembly adopted at a session 
held on 20 April 1991, remains the basic working document of the 
RS delegation. 
  2. There are no preconditions for the general cessation of 
hostilities and for the resumption of the peace process, but the 
RS delegation has been charged with a task of ensuring that the 
RS is given equal treatment at the talks; that is, that all 
forms of pressure on the Serb people, including the sanctions, 
are eliminated. 
  3. Future talks on former Bosnia-Herzegovina are to be 
conducted within the framework of a new peace conference. The 
results so far of the peace conference on former Yugoslavia -- 
agreed to by the three sides in the conflict and by all the 
relevant international factors -- must be taken into account. 
The basis for a territorial separation remain the actual 
situation on the ground and other relevant factors, such as the 
existence of two independent state entities in the territory of 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina: the RS and the Muslim-Croat 
federation. 
  4. Brcko and Posavina are the component parts of the RS and 
are of vital national importance. The assembly therefore rejects 
any attempt on the part of the international community to alter 
these territories as something other than vital territories for 
the entire Serb nation. 
  5. The bombing of Serb positions by NATO and missile attacks 
on Serb civilians in the vicinity of Tuzla by an UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] unit are hostile actions against the Serb 
nation, and all such actions must cease. 
  6. The assembly most strongly condemns the atrocious attack 
on Brcko by the Muslim army at the time the RS assembly was in 
session, which took the lives of four innocent civilians while 
several civilians were seriously or lightly injured.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian in its 1700 GMT newscast on 12 May 
broadcasts the reactions of various political parties to the 
Bosniak-Croatian accord reached in Vienna: 
  It is reported that "the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] is 
hailing the Vienna agreement, considering it to be a huge step 
toward peace. This agreement is also an important step toward 
the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and 
integral state. For various reasons the SDA has been of the 
opinion that the first president of the federation should be 
current President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic, which the 
public has been informed of with a statement from the 3 April 
session of the SDA Executive Concil. However, on that occasion 
already President Izetbegovic expressed the opinion that the 
agreement and implementation of the federation's constitution 
must not be put at risk on this issue, especially if the Croats 
demonstrate willingness to embrace solutions that are in the 
interest of Bosnia-Herzegovina. When the talks became 
deadlocked two days ago, President Izetbegovic informed the 
members of our negotiating team in Vienna of his position in 
writing, and this, among other things, helped to overcome the 
crisis. The Muslim people must have faith in the decisions of 
President Izetbegovic and there is no reason for concern. The 
SDA has an absolute majority in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly 
and according to the constitution of the federation, the 
Assembly has overall control over the work of the army and the 
government. Besides, President Izetbegovic remains the president 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency until peace is restored. 
Finally, President Izetbegovic remains the undisputed leader of 
the Muslim people in the country and outside it," the SDA 
statement declares. 
  "The Croatian Peasants' Party of Bosnia-Herzegovina believes 
that the Vienna agreement is yet another step toward the goal 
established by the Washington agreement. The party's opinion is 
that all this represents a painstaking progress toward the goal 
that is not as close as it would appear. The Croatian Peoples' 
Party considers it most important that the war between the two 
peoples has stopped." It is also reported that "the Croatian 
Peasants' Party expresses hope that with the assistance of the 
international community and the instruments that are at its 
disposal, the Serbian side, too, will join the agreement of the 
two peoples to preserve the integral Bosnia-Herzegovina within 
the internationally recognized borders." 
  "The municipal committee of the Croatian Democratic 
Community 
Sarajevo expresses its satisfaction over the outcome of the 
talks in Vienna, hoping that the implementation of this 
agreement will be completed soon, secretary of this party 
Stjepan (Dacic), stated for B-H PRESS. He expressed hope that 
this agreement will give impetus to a resolution of all disputes 
and promote the relations between the Croatian and the Bosniak 
people. We expect that the constitutional assembly of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation will soon pass appropriate 
decisions that will speed up the implementation of the Vienna 
agreement." 
  The radio then goes on to report that "the Liberal Bosniak 
Organization [LBO] is of the opinion that the creation of 
situation that led to uncertainty in the implementation of the 
provisions of the federation's constitution was unnecessary, LBO 
Vice President Salih [word indistinct], said in light of the 
[word indistinct] agreement on federation in Vienna. According 
to him it is clear from this agreement that it involved a 
conflict of a personal nature and the grand aspirations of some 
individuals to assume certain posts. The LBO supports the 
decision that the function of federation president be performed 
by a member of one people and the post of prime minister by a 
representative of the other people. In this sense the party 
supports the president of the federation coming from among the 
Croatian people, however, this candidate must be determined for 
an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina. Regarding the cantonal setup, 
the LBO does not consider it to be a firm territorial form of 
demarcation but rather an administrative form of government." 
  In contrast to the above reactions, the radio reports that 
Dragutin Zvonimir Cicak, head of the Croatian Civic Party of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from Zenica, "has said that the agreement on 
cantonal [word indistinct] is causing the Croatian Civic Party 
concern." Cicak adds that, "we cannot get into the heads of 
those who are working on the Bosnia-Herzegovina state 
constitution that the Bosnia-Herzegovina citizens are sovereign 
over the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina territory." Cicak further 
states that the drawing of internal borders with ethnic 
connotations is "nonsensical." "We are once more creating an 
atmosphere that will again lead to more conflicts in 
linguistics, education, sport, culture, and so on, and which 
will again lead nowhere." He assails the allocation of 
ministerial and other functions on an ethnic basis as "idiocy 
leading nowhere," because the country is currently suffering 
from an acute shortage of capable cadres anyway.

  [Text] Esteemed listeners, we have just received a 
statement from the office of the president of the Presidency. 
  According to reliable information, the aggressor will 
withdraw by tomorrow morning 3 km from the center of Gorazde, 
from both banks of the Drina River. In order to make this 
possible, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army will temporarily hand over 
the point Mala Biserna to the control of a British unit of the 
UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. If the aggressor does not 
comply with the agreement in full, the British have given 
guarantees that the positions on Mala Biserna will be returned 
to the Gorazde defenders at 1200 on 14 May. 
  This offer has been conveyed to our side by the aggressor 
via 
UNPROFOR. Sefid Buljubasic, commander of the Eastern Bosnian 
Operative Group, has informed the General Staff about this 
offer. President Izetbegovic has agreed to the plan since the 
departure of the Serbian aggressor creates the conditions not 
only for the further normalization of life in the enclave, but 
also for the return of the expelled population to the right bank 
of the Drina River. 
  This is contained in a statement from the office of the 
president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 13 (AFP) -- A UN military observer 
killed at the edge of the Sarajevo exclusion zone was a 
Malaysian, UN forces spokesman Eric Chaperon said Friday [13 
May], adding that the shell which hit his vehicle was "not an 
accident." Another UN observer injured in the same incident 
Thursday was an Egyptian but his life was not in danger, Major 
Chaperon said. He identified the dead observer as Major Ariffin 
Zakaria. He said his body was to be flown to Kuala Lumpur 
Friday and a brief military ceremony would be held in his honor 
at Sarajevo airport. He said the Egyptian was Lieutenant 
Colonel Mohamed Kamal El Din, who suffered shrapnel wounds to 
his legs and was evacuated by helicopter to a Canadian medical 
unit in Visoko, northwest of Sarajevo. 
  The UN military spokesman said a single shell was fired on 
their vehicle after it got stuck in mud at Cermenica, 15 
kilometers (eight miles) northeast of Visoko. "It is not an 
accident of firing," he stressed. But he refused to say whether 
the shell had been fired by Bosnian Serb forces who have a 
position only a kilometer (less than a mile) from where the 
observers' truck got bogged down. 
  The two UN soldiers had called for assistance. 
  The spokesman said a Bosnian Army soldier was also wounded 
when he and a colleague on board a tractor came under fire as 
they were trying to tow away the UN vehicle. He said the 
Bosnian soldier had been hit in the back, but was out of danger.

<F P=106> [Report by Izudin Durakovic from Gracanica] </F>
  [Text] Over the last few days the chetniks have been 
intensively shelling the defense lines and civilian targets in 
the theater of operations of Operative Group Gracanica. 
Yesterday they shelled Malesici, Gracanica, Brijesnica, 
Klokotnica, Lukavica, and Lukavac. They tried to infiltrate a 
sabotage group into the village of [word indistinct] but it was 
intercepted in time and forced to disperse. The enemy has also 
been intensively moving its armored and mechanized forces, 
concentrating them mostly toward the defense lines in the the 
117th Lukavac Brigade's theater of operations. 
  During all this, the Serbian media keeps broadcasting 
unscrupulous lies intended to keep up the shaky morale of the 
chetniks. The Serbian media keeps talking about the clashes for 
Vijenac, and the chetnik's successful defense of this 
strategically important point. The truth, however, is that 
Vijenac has been under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army for three days now, following a fierce counteroffensive 
when it captured Vijenac after just a few hours of fighting. 
Five more villages, stretching across some 9 square km, were 
liberated in the process. In this operation -- which was 
carried out in accordance with the strictest military criteria 
-- the Lilies [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldiers] of [Commander] 
Osman Puskar and the 119th Brigade captured 21 chetniks, and 
killed twice as many. As a result of this battle, the Serbian 
aggressor again violated the arms embargo against our forces, 
leaving our army better equipped by a T-34 tank, a 
self-propelled gun, eight mortars, a (PSP-type) Vis, four 
antiaircraft machine guns, three antiaircraft guns, and lots 
more besides. 
  In retaliation for this defeat on the front, the enemy has 
indiscriminately [words indistinct] of all calibers on civilian 
targets. However, this will not check our fighters in their 
defense leading to final liberation from the chetnik phalanx.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, May 12 (TANJUG) -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry on Thursday [12 May] condemned Muslim attacks on Brcko. 
Moscow believes that such attacks lead to further escalation of 
conflicts and that they are especially dangerous prior to the 
forthcoming ministerial conference in Geneva. The chief 
diplomats of the United States, Russia and the European Union 
and officials of the United Nations will meet in Geneva on 
Friday to try to definitively determine the framework for a 
political settlement of the crisis in the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The situation around the Serb town of Brcko in the north of 
Bosnia is currently at the focus of attention of political 
organs and the media in Moscow. Radio and television stations 
broadcast the news that the U.N. Security Council had condemned 
the Muslim attack on Brcko in which four civilians were killed 
and 13 wounded. It is believed here that the current situation 
in Bosnia, especially around Brcko, does not inspire a great 
deal of hope for an early settlement of the conflict. 
  Official sources here say that on both sides -- Serb and 
Muslim -- there are forces inclined to military confrontation 
who believe that a political settlement is impossible. Moscow 
has announced that its position in Geneva will be `very 
resolute' but it is not clear whether it will make any new 
proposals. Russia insists on an agreement that the warring 
sides resume talks as soon as possible. If this is not 
achieved, the war could continue indefinitely and the 
consequences could be disastrous, official sources in Moscow 
maintain.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 12 (TANJUG) -- Radio Sarajevo, loyal 
to the Bosnian Moslem regime of hardliner Alija Izetbegovic, on 
Thursday again reported fighting between rival Moslem factions 
in western Bosnia-Herzegovina. That part of the war-wracked 
former Yugoslav republic has since last autumn been the scene of 
fierce clashes between troops loyal to [word indistinct] leader 
Izetbegovic and supporters of his moderate rival and local 
leader Fikret Abdic. Abdic's supporters proclaimed their own 
autonomous province of western Bosnia in late September 1993, 
and have since signed friendship and cooperation treaties with 
the other two Bosnian nations -- Serbs and Croats. 
  Radio Sarajevo said that provincial forces on Thursday kept 
up a sustained attack, the brunt of which was directed at the 
village of Todorovo where `nearly all facilities have been 
demolished, including mosques and schools, and there was a 
considerable number of dead and wounded.' The source said that 
the Moslem army's 5th Corps, loyal to Izetbegovic, had managed 
to regain some strategically important positions captured by 
Abdic's troops the day before. The reports could not be 
independently confirmed.

  [Text] Zagreb, May 12 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croat Premier 
Jadranko Prlic said on Thursday that neighbouring Croatia's new 
currency, the kuna, would be used also in the Bosnian Croat 
state of Herzeg-Bosna, Mostar-based Herzeg-Bosna Radio said. 
Croatia will officially circulate the new currency on 
Independence Day, May 30. 
  The currency has the same name -- the kuna -- as that used 
in 
the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia during World War 
Two. 
  Immediately after Croatia's secession from the former 
Yugoslav Federation nearly three years ago, Bosnian Croats 
embraced the breakaway state's then currency -- the Croatian 
dinar -- thus making clear to one and all their ultimate 
objective -- secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina and union with 
Croatia. The Croatian news agency HINA has quoted Prlic as 
admitting that there are forces in Herzeg-Bosna which oppose the 
implementation of the Washington agreement on a Croat-Moslem 
federation in Bosnia- Herzegovina. There are political forces 
among the Croats which oppose the agreement, and there are also 
those who have lost members of immediate family in the fighting 
against the Moslems and do not want a union, Prlic explained. 
  Five-day U.S.-sponsored Croatian-Moslem talks at the U.S. 
embassy in Vienna ended on Wednesday in an agreement on a 
cantonal division of the future federation and the appointment 
of the two nations' officials to top state positions by rote.

  [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will not 
participate in the next government if the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP] nominates Chairman Gyula Horn for prime minister. 
Campaign chief Balint Magyar told journalists that if the MSZP 
names the party chairman as candidate for prime minister, they 
will read the message that the Socialists do not want to form a 
coalition with the SZDSZ. 
  The party will accept only an alliance in which it can 
realize its program, SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Petoe said. He added 
that the final word on coalition membership will be pronounced

<F P=106> ["Resolution of the National Council of the Albanian </F>
Republican Party"] 
  [Text] The National Council of the Albanian Republican 
Party, held on 8 April 1994, reviewed the activity of the 
steering committee in connection with the political situation in 
the country and some aspects of economic development. After much 
open discussion, the Council reached the following conclusions: 
  1. Political tensions have increased as a result of the 
abstractionism of the Socialist Party, clothed in the garments 
of renewal, and the abstractionism of its allies. Communism is 
still present in Albania. The "renewal" of the Socialists, 
imposed by time, is demagogy. 
  2. The efforts to bring the country out of the crisis have 
produced some good results with the general orientation to the 
free market but the optimal solution has not yet been achieved. 
The optimal solution can be achieved only by means of the 
republican program, which is based on the recognition and return 
of private property and, especially, ownership of the land. 
  3. The party in power, which has the heavy burden of 
governing the country, is continuing to develop a tendency to 
monopolize administrative leadership and political life, with a 
restraining effect on the development of democracy and the 
effective use of intellectual potential. This has paved the way 
for left-wing phenomena and recidivist elements from the past. 
  4. Corruption has taken on alarming proportions for the 
present and future of the country. Efforts to combat these 
manifestations, especially in the area of privatization, have 
been ineffective. 
  5. The Republican Party provided all types of assistance to 
the alliance of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and 
the Social Democratic Party, an alliance which was created at 
the time of the struggle for the overthrow of the communist 
government, and regarded this alliance as a compass for 
democratic developments. Under the present conditions, there is 
no hope that this alliance can be repeated. The Republican Party 
is in favor of cooperation with the Democratic Party if this 
party creates true conditions for real and sincere cooperation. 
  6. Keeping in mind the country's great interest in internal 
stability and foreign credibility, the Republican Party supports 
the government coalition, which guarantees general democratic 
developments. This does not prevent the Republican Party from 
freely stating its opinions and providing constructive 
opposition on all matters which are not in accord with its 
program. 
  7. The National Council is convinced that the creation of a 
right wing in Albania is necessary today because: 
  -- the right wing will be an effective counterbalance to the 
unproclaimed alliance of the left-wing forces which, under 
various labels and slogans, are aiming to reestablish the 
socialist form of government. 
  -- only the right wing can carry out free capitalist 
development, beginning with the recognition and return of legal 
ownership. 
  -- under current political conditions, only the right wing 
can represent a true democratic opposition. 
  -- during the past year, in particular, the foreign policy 
of 
the Albanian state in the defense of the country has followed a 
correct line. However, this policy will receive the necessary 
strength through coordination with the right wing's clear ideas 
on the country. 
  The leadership of the party is charged with engaging in 
discussions with right-wing political parties and associations 
to formulate joint guidelines and action plans on the basis of 
political reality and national interests. 
  8. The Republican Party will increase its struggle, in an 
effective manner, for the return of property and, first, for the 
enactment of a just land law. The republican concept of 
ownership must be extended over the entire economic spectrum. At 
the same time, the Republican Party must anticipate the problems 
resulting from capitalist development. 
  9. The Republican Party will work with perseverance to 
attract intellectuals into its ranks and management. The party's 
central headquarters and the party press are being reorganized 
and oriented on the basis of the guidelines in this resolution. 
  10. The membership of Arben Babameto, Arben Brace, Arsen 
Proko, Durim Kulli, and Neritan Alibali on the party's steering 
committee is approved.

  [Excerpt] Hard coal miners have ended their two-week 
strike. This was possible thanks to an accord between the trade 
unionists and the chairmen of the coal companies. In a number 
of cities, Solidarity organized strikes and demonstrations. 
This is a part of the protest action the continuation of which 
was decided upon yesterday by the National Commission. The 
action is to continue until the time that the government 
undertakes bilateral talks with Solidarity on the subject of 
national postulates. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The miners will not receive pay 
for the period of the strike. In the course of talks during the 
night, the protestors agreed to work off the strike days during 
time normally off work. They can also include the strike days 
as part of their holidays or take them as unpaid leave. Before 
the miners receive payments for the days worked off, they will 
be able to apply for advances. Now they are awaiting the 
implementation of the decisions adopted. 
  [Begin recording by miners Solidarity official Karol 
Luzniak, 
identified by caption] Eleven postulates out of 12 were settled 
or agreed upon yesterday and set down on paper, which does not 
mean that they are implemented yet. Here, miners will surely be 
awaiting on an immediate basis a report on what is taking place 
during the meetings of the teams that have been created. [end 
recording] 
  [Correspondent] Production has recommenced at the hard coal 
mines, starting from the second shift today. The miners also 
ended their occupation of the State Hard Coal Agency in 
Katowice. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] On 18 April, despite President Walesa's 
decision to veto a new electoral law for local governments, 
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak announced that new local 
elections would be held on 19 June. As a result of Walesa's 
veto, these elections will be conducted according to the 
existing electoral law, dated June 1990 and updated with special 
provisions for the city of Warsaw passed earlier this year. 
(Polonia TV Network, 18 Apr 94) 
  The most important difference between the current electoral 
system and the vetoed alternative is the threshold at which 
proportional representation applies. According to the current 
law, election by simple majority applies in gminas 
(municipalities, the smallest administrative units) of up to 
40,000 residents and proportional representation in those over 
40,000. The proposal approved by the Sejm but rejected by Walesa 
would have lowered the cutoff to gminas with 15,000 inhabitants. 
The president criticized the new law as "an attempt by the 
governing coalition to politicize the elections by putting its 
own people into the local governments." Walesa also expressed 
dissatisfaction with a provision that "forbids conducting 
campaigns in churches," arguing that "separation of church and 
state is a political fact that the church fully respects. There 
is no need to emphasize this any further." The presidential 
statement met with strong support from the secretary of 
Episcopate Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, who "was very pleased with 
the presidential veto." (GAZETA WYBORCZA 13 Apr 94) 
  Depending on the gmina's population, between 15 and 100 
council members will be elected in single- or multiple-seat 
districts in the following manner: 15 council members in gminas 
with fewer than 4,000 inhabitants; 18 in gminas with 4,000-7,000 
inhabitants; 20 in gminas with 7,000-10,000 inhabitants; 24 in 
gminas with 10,000-20,000 inhabitants; 28 in gminas with 
20,000-40,000 inhabitants; 30 in gminas with 40,000-60,000 
inhabitants; 36 in gminas with 60,000-80,000 inhabitants; 40 in 
gminas with 80,000-100,000 inhabitants; and up to 100 members to 
those gminas (exclusively in Warsaw, which is divided into 
several gminas) with more than 1 million inhabitants. 
("Panorama" newscast, Second TV Network 18 Apr 94) 
  The deadline for submitting the names of candidates for the 
local councils is 20 May. Candidates in single-seat voting 
districts are required to provide petitions with at least 15 
signatures supporting their nomination; petitions with 150 
signatures are needed for candidate lists in multiseat 
districts." Residents of Warsaw will vote according to the new 
"law on the administration system of the capital city of 
Warsaw," which divides the city into several gminas. ("Panorama" 
newscast, Second TV Network 18 Apr 94)

  [Excerpts] The delegations of the Slovene and Croatian 
parliamentary commissions for international affairs met in 
Ljubljana this morning. The Croatian delegation was led by Dr. 
Zarko Domljan and the Slovene by Zoran Thaler. Nadja Pengov 
reports: 
  [Begin Pengov recording] The topics of today's talks, which 
were assessed as good, covered more or less three issues: The 
position of both countries in Europe, mutual relations, and 
dangerous signals that have recently been coming from Italy. 
Regarding the first, both states share similar goals, they are 
merely in different positions, the position of Slovenia being 
better today due to objective circumstances. 
  What about mutual relations? We did not hide the fact that 
some problems exist, it was stated, however, these are not such 
as to damage the otherwise good relations between the countries. 
The delegations concluded that the work of the commissions for 
borders and the agreement on border cooperation should be 
accelerated. The Slovene side particularly singled out problems 
connected to property. This agreement is already prepared, 
however, Croatia is making it conditional on the resolution of 
issues concerning the nuclear power plant and the debts of 
Ljubljanska Banka. 
  During the talks they also touched on the speculation that 
Dr. Zarko Domljan was negotiating a 
Slovene-Croatian-Bosnia-Herzegovina federation with an 
unidentified Slovene politician. It was established that this 
was a hoax. Dr. Domljan explained his vision about future 
relations between the countries by saying that Slovenia is a 
priority for Croatia, that the countries must link up solely on 
the basis of interests, into a sort of a customs, monetary, or 
some other type of union. [passage omitted] 
  Relations with Italy. The degree of consensus between 
Slovenia and Croatia is most important here. There will be no 
alteration of borders and this is out of the question. The 
agreements must be observed. There will be no new negotiations 
about the prevailing agreements. 
  The question of compensation for the former property of 
exiles [optanti] has been solved and the countries will not 
negotiate this here either. The governments of both countries 
should agree as soon as possible on the amount of compensation 
that Slovenia and Croatia should pay. Once this is done, they 
will, because of Italy's [word indistinct] which does not 
provide an account number to which the debt could be paid, do 
this themselves and inform the Italian side where its money is. 
Dr. Zarko Domljan here stressed the importance of Slovenia and 
Croatia having a joint action strategy on these issues. [end

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman spoke on the 
telephone to his Bosnian counterpart Alija Izetbegovic today, 
and expressed satisfaction with an agreement reached by the 
Croatian and Bosnian delegations in Vienna on Wednesday evening, 
the presidential office said in a statement today. The two 
presidents agree that the implementation of the Washington 
agreement on establishing a Muslim-Croatian federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should continue. They also talked about 
solving technical issues to enable President Tudjman to visit 
Sarajevo as soon as possible, and about their joint stand on the 
contact group and the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers in 
Geneva. Tudjman asked Izetbegovic to use his authority to step

  [Text] As we have announced, Presidents Izetbegovic and 
Tudjman today agreed to send an identical letter to the 
ministers of a liaison group in Geneva that will venture on a 
quest tomorrow to restore peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the 
two presidents' letter, the following is stated, among other 
things: 
  The delegations of the Bosniaks and the Croats in Vienna 
yesterday reached a concrete and detailed agreement on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's internal setup on the basis of the 
Washington agreement. This agreement offers a chance for an 
overall political solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina on a just 
basis. The Bosniaks and Croats do not harbor any aspirations 
for foreign property and territories, or the rights of others. 
We ask your help in the negotiations with the Serbian side. In 
our opinion, we must make it plain to both the Serbian side and 
the international public, that you are opposed to: 
  -- aggression and ethnic cleansing being rewarded, 
  -- that the conclusions of the London conference are your 
conclusions, too, and, 
  -- that you will neutralize the Serbian military machinery 
in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia by political and other means if 
the Serbs reject a peaceful and reasonable solution. 
  If we are to accomplish peace we need a firm stance. The 
decisions that you will make tomorrow are very important and 
will determine the course of international events, especially in 
the regions where the Communist regime has collapsed. So reads 
the identically-worded letters that Presidents Izetbegovic and 
Tudjman sent to the liaison group ministers.

  [Text] Tirana, May 13 (ATA) -- "There is no doubt that the 
friendly relations and the close cooperation with the countries 
in our region, with our neighbours, have been and will be a 
priority of the Albanian foreign policy," Albanian president 
Sali Berisha said in an interview with the Albanian television 
on May 12. 
  Mr. Berisha said that the aim of this visit is the extension 
of the political, economic, cultural and scientific cooperation 
between the two friendly countries. 
  The friendship and cooperation treaty signed in Romania, the 
removal of double taxation between the two countries, the 
encouragement of investments and the economic and scientific 
cooperation which complete the full legislation "place the 
relations of these two friendly countries on a new basis 
guaranteeing for them a reliable prospective." 
  "In my opinion, through its equilibrium in politics, Romania 
has made a great contribution to the safeguarding of peace and 
stability in the Balkans," Mr. Berisha said, adding that "it is 
indisputable that the economic cooperation with the countries of 
the region is indispensable in order that Albania and the region 
in general be integrated into the European Union". 
  "In the talks with President Iliescu, we made an extensive 
analysis not only of the bilateral relations but also of the 
situation in the region in general," Mr. Berisha said. 
  "Romania is committed to contribute to the prevention of the 
conflict, to its solution through peaceful means and dialogue." 
  "Romanians have some traditional ties with Serbia, ties that 
are stronger than others and I insisted in the talks with Mr. 
Iliescu and the Romanian Government that these ties too must be 
used to influence in Belgrade to start an unconditional dialogue 
with Pristina in the presence of a third party," Albanian 
president said. He considered as very important the lowering of 
tension and the beginning of efforts for the solution of a very 
complicated problem as that of Kosova is." 
  "In my meeting with the opposition, Mr. Constantinescu, who 
is my friend, I had the pleasure to notice that both the 
Romanian Government and the opposition have similar opinions 
with regard to the foreign policy. Both parties nurture 
profoundly friendly feelings for Albania and the Albanians and 
are greatly interested in a close cooperation with our country," 
Mr. Berisha said. Romania is ready to support Albania's 
membership to the Council of Europe and to cooperate with 
Albania in the context of the Partnership for Peace and other 
international institutions. 
  Speaking of a meeting an a working luncheon with the 
Hungarian president, Arpad Goncz, during a stop-over to Budapest 
on his way Romania, Mr. Berisha said that we stressed that 
numerous agreements have been signed during the last two years 
and we are preparing to sign very soon the treaty between 
Albania and Hungary and other agreements which will complete the 
legislation of this important cooperation," President Berisha 
said. 
  Concerning the Kosova problem, President Berisha pointed out 
that "Hungarian President Goncz said that the Kosova problem is 
a very delicate problem and the Balkan crisis cannot be solved 
unless the Kosova question is resolved." President Berisha also 
said that he had a full understanding with the Hungarian 
president about all the developments in the region. Mr. Berisha 
appreciated the free election in Hungary, which, he said, are "a 
victory of democracy." President Berisha appreciated the fact 
that none of the extremist parties is represented in the 
Parliament. 
  President Berisha also stressed that "Presidents Iliescu and 
Goncz had accepted his invitations to visit Albania in in a near 
future."

  [Text] Tirana May 12 (ATA) -- The latest report of the 
British Section of the ISHR [International Society for Human 
Rights] (Simon McIlwaine, 31 December 1993) exposes widespread 
abuses of human rights by the Greek authorities. Greece 
continues to violate the basic human rights of, in particular, 
the Macedonian Slavs of northern Greece, and followers of 
non-Greek Orthodox religious such as Jehovah's Witnesses. This 
is in direct contravention of both the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. 
Greece is currently holding the Presidency of the European 
Union. 
  Firstly by giving some background information on the mix of 
ethnic groups living in Greece since its foundation in the 
1830's, this report challenges the official assumption that the 
Greek state is ethnically homogenous. This presumption has led 
to the repeated and official denial of the existence of 
minorities which are not of pure "Hellenic" origin. This 
obsession with Greek racial identity is embodied in the idea 
that Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] is Greek, and Greek alone. 
  On 20 July 1993 a (Slavonic) cultural festival was held in 
the village of Melitis. This involved only the participation of 
local musical and dance groups. Before the celebrations began 
the local police ordered the musicians to refrain from playing 
songs in their own language. When an attempt was made to sing 
songs in Slav, the proceedings were forcibly broken up by the 
police. According to the report official harassment of the 
Slavs has intensified over the past two years. 
  Official harassment has extended to human rights activists. 
During a visit to Greece last year, Professor Eric Siesby, 
vice-chairman of the International Helsinki Federation, arranged 
by telephone to meet some Slav dissidents, at his hotel in 
Florina. An hour after the appointed time his guests had failed 
to appear. The professor discovered, to his horror, that his 
hotel has been surrounded by armed police, who had monitored his 
telephones calls and then deployed to prevent the dissidents 
from entering the building. 
  In March 1993 a Greek court sentenced two Germans and two 
Turkish travellers to seven months imprisonment for carrying 
posters which read "Freedom and Independence for Macedonia." 
Their "offence" was to display the material on board an Olympic 
Airways jet before it took off from Athens Airport on a flight 
to Frankfurt. The court convicted them of "spreading false 
information" and "interfering with air traffic." One of the 
convicted was Professor Josef Rochensaus, who told the court 
that he was a "free person with the right to freedom of speech," 
which the court ignored. 
  Macedonian Slavs who leave Greece face a further risk. Under 
the Greek nationality law, Greek citizens of non-Hellenic ethnic 
origin, who leave Greece may find themselves stripped of their 
citizenship in their absence. They may be deemed to have 
emigrated permanently from Greece, and as the decision is an 
administrative act, it cannot be challenged in the Greek courts. 
  Greek citizens of Slav or Turkish ethnic origin have gone 
abroad for a few months, only to find that they cannot return to 
their native country because some officials, has in their 
absence, deemed them to have emigrated permanently and thus 
relinquished citizenship. Under Law 106841 of 1982, and law 
1540 of 1985, Greek citizens of Hellenic descent, deprived of 
their citizenship and property rights by such an act can apply 
for a reversal of the decision, others are subjected to the 
confiscatory effects of the legislation. The report also shows 
a growing pattern of evidence of the suppression of freedom of 
religion of non-Greek Orthodox believers. Under Article 13, 
Paragraph 2 of the Greek Constitution, "proselytism" for 
religions, other than the Orthodox faith is forbidden, by the 
terms of Article 4 of Law 1363/1983 of the penal code. This law 
was introduced when Greece was ruled by the fascist government 
in the Metaxas era, which makes it a criminal offence to seek 
converts to other faiths. 
  Over two thousand of Jehovah's Witnesses, Baptists and 
Pentecostalists have been arrested in the last ten years under 
this law, some four hundred have been imprisoned. Several of 
these religious detainees report abuse and beating in jail. 
  One example of the degree of persecution cited is the case 
of 
Minos Kokkoinakis. Born in 1909 in Sitia, Crete, he is a 
merchant and still lives in the same town. He has been arrested 
sixty times since 1938. 
  Kapeleri Evanggelia, from Platans, has been jailed 13 times 
for his activities as a Jehovah's Witness, he has additionally 
alleged torture and mistreatment by the police. 
  George Gerefalakis of Heraklion, Crete, was tried for 
"proselytism" on 10th May 1990. He was 86 years old, and 
terminally ill with cancer, he had to be carried into court on a 
stretcher. His accusers were two Greek Orthodox priests. Mr. 
Gerefalakis was convicted as charged and sentenced to seven 
months imprisonment. Tragically, he died in jail on 10th June 
1990. 
  The report also examines the fate of religious conscientious 
objectors to compulsory military service. By May 1993, the ISHR 
had established that there were 388 imprisoned in very poor 
conditions. 
  Other violations on religious freedom include the ban on 
employment of non-Orthodox believers as teacher, even in private 
schools. One example cited is the case of Valiki Pilaftsgou, 
who in October 1991, applied for a permit to teach biology and 
French. He was refused because he is a Jehovah's Witness. 
  Additionally, Greek law imposes restrictions on the 
publication, circulation and importation of non-Orthodox 
religious literature.

  [Text] Tirana, May 13 (ATA) -- Representatives from the 
strike commission, the association of the families whose land 
and property have been inundated by the Fierza Lake, and the 
Presidency of the Kukes and Has Districts met yesterday 
afternoon [12 May] with Premier Meksi, government 
representatives and deputies. The participants in the meeting 
said that the strike has only an economic character. They said 
that the difficulties created in the Kukes district and 
northeastern areas are greater than those in other districts. 
  The conclusions drawn in the five hour meeting were included 
in a joint communique of the premier and the strikers. 
  The formula of solving the problem of those stricken by the 
construction of the Fierza hydro-power station is the organised 
removal to other districts of the families under the most 
difficult living conditions, providing them with house and land. 
The government members said this solution has long since begun 
to be applied but it is delayed because of the verification of 
the related lists. The families left without land in the 
inundated areas are made evident first and free areas in other 
districts are being found out. 
  Priority will be given to the families under very difficult 
economic conditions, without land, job and other living means. 
  The participants in the meeting agreed that the problem be 
solved in cooperation with all the parties. They decided that 
measures be adopted to provide social assistance and improve its 
structure as well as to compensate for the land, always 
favouring those lacking the living means. 
  In the mean time, the land and homes of the inhabitants to 
be 
displaced will be used for solving problems of those that will 
continue to live in those areas. The government's spokesman 
reported that the government will help the removed inhabitants 
with long term credits to build houses considering them as 
shelterless. Funds of international organisations also are 
envisaged to be used in this respect. Premier Meksi promised to 
go and meet with the Kukes inhabitants soon.

  [Text] Sofia, May 13 (BTA) -- Today Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov filed with the Secretarial Department of the National 
Assembly the cabinet's programme of intent concerning the 
structural and personnel cabinet changes. The MP's may be 
expected to discuss the programme next week. 
  Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov is very likely to take 
office as one of the deputy prime ministers, Prof. Berov told 
reporters in parliament. He denied that the post of deputy 
prime minister had been ever offered to Prof. Todor Vulchev, 
governor of the Bulgarian National Bank. The negotiations are 
still going on, the prime minister said, adding there would be 
no meetings with representatives of the parliamentary groups 
today. 
  This week Prime Minister Berov held consultations with the 
parliamentary groups of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms (DPS), whose mandate he used to form a cabinet at 
the end of 1992, and with the parliamentary Bulgarian Socialist 
Party (BSP), which supports the government. The DPS had 
parallel talks with the New Union for Democracy (NSD), a 
parliamentary group set up by expelees and breakaways from the 
Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), and with the Civil Alliance 
for the Republic, which unites the MP's who split from the BSP 
parliamentary group. 
  After his yesterday's [12 May] meeting with Prof. Berov, BSP 
leader Zhan Videnov said that the new project for cabinet 
changes was better than the first one. Yesterday DPS leader 
Ahmed Dogan said he had stressed at a meeting with Prime 
Minister Berov that the DPS wanted the formula of expert 
government be reckoned with when carrying out the cabinet 
changes. On Wednesday [11 May] the parliamentary SDS moved for 
a vote of no confidence in the government. At an extraordinary 
meeting today, the NSD MP's considered the prime minister's 
programme for changes and revised their initial position on not 
taking part in any negotiations on the cabinet's overhaul. The 
NSD revising its position made NSD co-chairperson Stefan 
Bozhilov resign as a leader of that parliamentary group.

  [Excerpt] Sofia, May 11 (BTA) -- Today Bulgaria assumed the 
chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of 
Europe [CE] for the next six months. "Bulgaria's prestige in 
Europe and the world will depend on its performance as chair of 
the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Ministers," 
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said upon his 
departure for Strasbourg. 
  Addressing the session of the Committee of Ministers, 
Foreign 
Minister Stanislav Daskalov outlined the main points in the work 
of the committee during Bulgaria's chairmanship. 
  "During the past few years the Council of Europe has proved 
capable of meeting the challenges of the new developments on the 
continent. Our present time, however, is so dynamic that we are 
already facing new realities, requiring our organization to 
adapt itself to them and develop still further its ability to 
react rapidly and adequately," Mr. Daskalov said. 
  "The future profile of our organization depends on the 
successful and balanced solution of the problem of the 
enlargement of the Council of Europe (...) which should continue 
without lowering the standards for membership," Mr. Daskalov 
said in his address. 
  "Political dialogue should be deepened and intensified. Not 
only in view of enlarging the organization, but also of 
stabilizing its achievements and of further reinforcing and 
adapting the Council of Europe's actions, including in certain 
fields evaded by now. This is the only possible way to enhance 
the democratic changes in our societies and to harmonize our 
efforts in European unification. In this respect we consider 
the increase of the role played by the Committee of Ministers as 
the central policy-forming and decision- making body of the 
organization to be of crucial importance. 
  "The complexity of the new tasks to be solved and problems 
to 
be overcome demands an ever increasing consolidation and 
intensification of the coordination between the Council of 
Europe and other European institutions involved in the 
construction of a democratic security system in Europe. In 
particular we consider it important to strengthen the 
co-operation with the European Union. Relations with the CSCE 
should also be further stimulated," Foreign Minister Stanislav 
Daskalov said. 
  Mr. Daskalov pointed out in his speech that as chairman of 
the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe Bulgaria 
would make every possible effort to contribute to the common 
future of the European Continent and do its best to implement 
the decisions of the Vienna summit. 
  Addressing Secretary General Catherine Lalumiere, Bulgarian 
Foreign Minister Daskalov said: 
  "We appreciate the brilliant way in which you have conducted 
the organization during the past five challenging years of its 
history -- years which changed its face and its future. We have 
witnessed your personal efforts and involvement in these 
changes, your devotion to the principles and ideals of the 
Council of Europe and of united Europe as a whole. I personally 
would like to assure you that in the heart of my country your 
name will be associated with Bulgaria's accession to the Council 
of Europe." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Iva Toncheva: "Bulgarian Foreign Minister To </F>
Visit Turkey"] 
  [Text] Sofia, May 12 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister 
Stanislav Daskalov is leaving Monday [16 May] on a three-day 
official visit to Turkey. 
  In Ankara, Mr. Daskalov and his Turkish counterpart Hikmet 
Cetin the state of Bulgarian-Turkish relations, the development 
of the Yugoconflict and international problems. [sentence as 
received] In a Treaty of Friendship, Goodneighbourliness, 
Cooperation and Security signed in May 1992, Bulgaria and Turkey 
declared their readiness to adopt the non-aggression principle 
as a fundamental principle of their bilateral relations and to 
promote their economic, transport and trade cooperation. 
Bulgaria and Turkey have also signed a protocol on the start of 
arrangements for agreements on reciprocal investment promotion 
and on the avoidance of double taxation. The drafting of the 
two agreements, as well as of agreements on trade, economic and 
industrial cooperation will continue during Mr. Daskalov's 
forthcoming visit to Ankara. Some of these accords will be 
signed when President Zhelyu Zhelev visits Turkey in June. 
  Bulgarian-Turkish relations have been making successful 
progress in the last few years, after they reached an all-time 
low between 1984 and 1989 over the forced name change of 
Bulgarian Turks by the communist regime. When the then prime 
minister Filip Dimitrov visited Turkey for talks with his 
Turkish opposite number in May 1992, this was the first 
top-level contact between the two countries in 14 years. "We do 
not believe that there should be boundaries between us, in the 
sense of barriers between the two countries; moreover, we hope 
that in the relations we establish between us we can only serve 
as a model for one such melting of boundaries regionwide, and 
the way we can be open, the entire region can be open and 
transparent," Mr. Dimitrov said during that visit. Since 1989, 
Bulgarian chief diplomats have visited Ankara four times: Viktor 
Vulkov in May and August 1991, and Stoyan Ganev in November 1991 
and September 1992. Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin came 
to Sofia twice, in March 1992 and in December 1993. During his 
1992 visit, the two countries signed three documents: a 
protocol on joint work on the promotion of Bulgarian-Turkish 
relations, an intergovernmental agreement on relaxation of 
currency controls (annexed to the 1979 agreement), and an 
intergovernmental agreement to lift restrictions on the freedom 
of movement of diplomatic and consular staff. According to a 
Bulgarian Foreign Ministry official, the protocol on expansion 
of cooperation between Bulgaria and Turkey may be signed at this 
stage.

  [Text] Sofia, May 10 (BTA) -- "This is a very important 
visit. It is at a good level and it is important to keep our 
relations at this level at least. There are a lot of problems 
of mutual interest which we can resolve together," Lieutenant 
General Janos Deak, commander of the Hungarian Army and General 
Staff Chief, told BTA. Gen. Deak is leading a Hungarian military 
delegation on a two-day visit to Bulgaria paid under the 
Bulgarian-Hungarian programme for cooperation in the military 
field. 
  The programme for military cooperation between Bulgaria and 
Hungary should be expanded, Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of 
the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, and Gen. Janos Deak 
agreed at their meeting today. "The consensus of the Hungarian 
Parliament on the Army Act adopted in 1993 has opened a 
possibility for the active restructuring of the armed forces in 
that country and Bulgaria can learn a lot from Hungary's 
experience in this respect," Gen. Petrov told BTA. It is planned 
to expand joint activities mainly in the exchange of information 
and experience in carrying out the reform and restructuring of 
the armed forces and in providing supplies for the armies under 
the conditions of a market economy. According to Gen. Petrov, 
it is the sides' shared opinion that the Balkans are an area 
arousing concern among the European and the regional 
communities. Bulgarian-Hungarian military cooperation was also 
discussed at the meeting which the Hungarian guest had with 
Deputy Minister of Defence Grigor Khandzhiev. 
  The problems of relations between the military and civil 
army 
leaderships were considered at the meeting of Gen. Deak and 
Parliamentary National Security Committee Chairman Nikolay 
Slatinski. The sides exchanged experience on the legislative 
solution to army problems. "The Bulgarian Parliament may not 
pass the defence and armed forces legislation because many keep 
talking about early elections, and it will take another two 
months to finalize the bill," BTA was told by Mr. Slatinski. He 
shared his positive impression from the pragmatic approach 
applied by the Hungarian Defence Ministry in resolving the 
economic problems under the conditions of transition to a market 
economy. "As NATO's Partnership for Peace plan is still at a 
stage of political solutions, it has no&amp; been discussed in 
detail," the Bulgarian parliamentarian said. He stressed that 
integration within Europe should not be achieved at the expense 
of the Central and East European countries' bilateral relations. 
"A kind of 'rivalry' observed at international forums gives rise 
to prejudice in this respect sometimes," Mr. Slatinski said. 
"Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov's idea of expanding 
military contacts among the Danubian countries has not become 
state policy yet," he stated. Mr. Slatinksi believes that the 
idea was developed by the political scientist, diplomat and 
historian Valentin Aleksandrov rather than Valentin Aleksandrov 
the defence minister. 
  The idea of expanding the Danubian countries' military 
contacts was discussed by Defence Minister Aleksandrov and his 
Hungarian counterpart Lajos Fur in Sofia in March 1993. At the 
time the two defence ministers confirmed the sides' shared 
desire for the promotion of bilateral military cooperation at 
all levels. A joint declaration was signed on the advancement 
of military ties in the spirit of the cooperation agreement 
concluded between the Bulgarian and Hungarian Defence Ministries 
in Sofia in 1991. The agreement built on the political 
declaration on bilateral relations which President Zhelyu Zhelev 
of Bulgaria and President Arpad Goncz of Hungary had signed in 
Budapest the previous month. The agreement is an expression of 
the desire for cooperation based on mutual respect and aimed at 
confidence building, which would help establish an European 
collective security system. It makes provisions for 
coordination of the activity of the two countries' Defence 
Ministries in the implementation of the United Nations 
resolutions concerning peacekeeping and of their activity within 
the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe process. The bilateral documents map out the fields of 
future joint work on the problems of security policies, 
development of the armies and their staff structure, 
modernization in the military and technological field, defence 
economy and financial support of the armies, etc.

<F P=106> [Report by Andrey Sharkov] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, May 11 (BTA) -- The government had not 
prepared answers to the proposals by the Confederation of 
Independent Trade Unions (KNSB) and came up with three versions 
of a document on cost-of-living bonuses to public sector 
employees, KNSB leader Krustyu Petkov told the press today after 
the official talks on the union demands. The KNSB has warned 
that it will call a general strike on May 17. It was decided 
that the government proposals would be discussed by a working 
group as of May 13. Prof. Petkov also said the government was 
ready to put forward its ideas on the other proposals by the 
KNSB, including the curbing of inflated prices and giving an 
impetus to the structural adjustment of the economy and 
privatization, which are now at a standstill. Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov headed the government delegation to the talks as 
Prof. Petkov had insisted. 
  While suggesting certain measures, the KNSB has failed to 
suggest ways and means to solve problems, Deputy Prime Minister 
Evgeni Matinchev said after the talks. The trade union should 
comply with budget austerity in 1994, as well as with the 
agreements with the IMF on the cabinet's domestic economic 
policy, Matinchev said. The document proposed by the cabinet is 
incomplete and needs updating, trade union leader Petkov said. 
Tomorrow the KNSB will present to Finance Minister Stoyan 
Aleksandrov a draft document on the protection of deposits of 
individuals from inflation. The trade union will press 
parliament to amend the Confiscation Act and pass a bankruptcy 
law and a law on the separation of social funds from the budget, 
Petkov said. 
  On April 4 the KNSB announced it would call a general strike 
and made social and union claims on the cabinet, which were 
further developed. The trade union calls for state programmes 
for economic stabilization. The KNSB insists on the 
rehabilitation of the economy and clarifications on certain 
questions of foreign policy. An appeal to the political forces 
approved by the trade union yesterday calls for "a new reform, 
new parliamentary elections and a new government." The KNSB 
pledged its assistance and at least two years of social peace to 
any party or coalition that would win the elections by 
democratic means and would implement a national reform 
programme. Should the political forces, parliament and the 
government persist in trying to implement a reform forced on 
this country, which poses a threat of lasting instability and a 
return to totalitarianism, the KNSB will block this reform, the 
document says. 
  The other most influential trade union, Podkrepa, officially 
stated yesterday it would not support the KNSB strike. Podkrepa 
affirmed that it is against the present cabinet and called for 
parliamentary elections. Podkrepa leader Konstantin Trenchev 
informed Krustyu Petkov that Podkrepa was considering 
"unconventional forms of protest" against a new government if it 
allowed the "plundering of the country" to continue behind its 
back. 
  The Association of Democratic Trade Unions announced a day 
of 
union action today and staged protests in Sofia. In an appeal 
to the state institutions the association called for amendments 
to Labour Code provisions on cooperation between the cabinet, 
employers and the trade unions, and on collective bargaining.

  [Text] Sofia, May 12 (BTA) -- A protocol on the 21st 
session which the Mixed Intergovernmental Bulgarian-Iraqi 
Commission on Economic, Industrial and Trade Cooperation 
completed in Sofia was signed here today by Finance Minister 
Stoyan Aleksandrov and Iraq's Agriculture Minister Dr. Bashir 
'Alwan Hammadi. The commission considered the state of 
bilateral economic, commercial and industrial and research 
cooperation and the prospects for its development in a way 
consistent with the UN Security Council resolutions. 
  The document insists that Bulgaria be included among the 
first recipients of Iraqi repayments on state and corporate 
loans after the embargo is lifted, with compensation for the 
losses and the right to complete unfinished construction and 
other projects. It is insisted that the debt be repaid in 
convertible currency or through the delivery of crude oil at 
international market prices. 
  Iraq does not contest Bulgaria's receivables. The Iraqis 
suggested a draft agreement on trade, economic, research and 
technological cooperation to replace the bilateral agreement on 
economic and technological cooperation which was signed on 
February 12, 1986 and expired on February 13, 1991. 
  After the signing of the document, Mr. Aleksandrov expressed 
the wish that the embargo against Iraq be lifted as soon as 
possible so that contacts between the two countries could be 
normalized. He said that in compliance with Article 50 of the 
UN Charter, Bulgarian diplomacy has consulted the Security 
Council with regard to a solution of its special economic 
problems arising from the world body's resolution, but the 
request has not been granted. "Turkey and Jordan have already 
received such facilitations, but we will keep trying," Mr. 
Aleksandrov said. "All the more so since Bulgaria has the moral 
right (to such facilitation), being a country which suffered 
substantial losses from the observance of the embargo at a 
period of economic hardship."

  [Excerpt] Prague, May 12 (CTK) -- The Assembly for the 
Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) said today "it 
must call on Vaclav Havel to immediately resign over the 
international shame which he has caused by the choice of his 
friends and collaboators for important posts" at the 
Presidential Office (KPR). 
  In its statement given to CTK by a member of the 
extreme-right SPR-RSC leadership, Josef Krejsa, the party said 
that in connection with the report by the Supreme Inspection 
Office (NKU) on the KPR's financial management it would also 
"have to lodge with the NKU a complaint of (KPR head) Josef 
Dobrovsky." 
  "The strange management of state property, probably 
involving 
bribes and unjustified payments, are the best proofs of the 
character of not only Havel's collaborators, but of himself as 
well," the statement says. 
  According to the NKU report, the KPR made last year

  [Text] Prague May 13 (CTK) -- Premier Vaclav Klaus claims 
he was misrepresented when he commented about the success of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) in the first round of elections 
on Czech Radio on May 10, he says in an interview in the 
independent newspaper LIDOVE NOVINY today. 
  Recalling Klaus's comment that the Czech Republic was 
becoming a "little non-leftist island in the centre of Europe", 
the LIDOVE NOVINY interviewer asks the premier to explain why 
the Hungarian Socialists have what is considered to be a very 
similar economic policy to the Czech Government. 
  Klaus responds by saying that his statements on the 
Hungarian 
election results had been "very balanced", and that the "cheap 
joke" about the island came at the very end and was taken out of 
context. 
  He emphasises he did not simplify the election results in 
Hungary and Poland -- where the left also recently returned to 
power -- and it would never have occurred to him to regard them 
as constituting the "return of the communists." He said he 
never had doubts that the left-wing parties in question could 
not conduct a "more or less balanced and reasonable economic 
policy." 
  Klaus adds that his participation in a panel discussion with 
MSZP chairman Gyula Horn at the World European Forum last year 
revealed a profound difference in their views. Horn's arguments 
reminded him, he says, of the debates about economic reform in 
Czechoslovakia in 1990-91 with opponents of his economic 
strategy. It would be mistaken to conceal those differences. 
  Nonetheless Hungary remains a "very close partner in all 
areas." He is convinced the Czech Republic will be able to 
cooperate just as effectively as with the previous government 
and says he believes the thorny issue of minorities, which 
always worried him about the former government, might now recede 
into the background.

  [Text] Prague, May 11 (CTK) -- The Czech Government has 
approved the presentation documents for the Partnership for 
Peace project which the Foreign Ministry is to submit to NATO, 
Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said at a press conference after 
the government session today. 
  The documents are only in draft form and will probably be 
reworked on consultation with NATO, he said. 
  The documents represent an intensification of the 
preparations for Czech membership in the security structures. 
They include consultation in the event of a threat to the 
security of the Czech Republic on the basis of 16+1, i.e. the 
sixteen NATO members plus in such a case the Czech Republic, he 
said. In addition they embrace further political consultation, 
the support of United Nations (U.N.) forces and work on the 
compatibility of the Czech Army with the armies of the alliance. 
  The Czech Republic is to offer its training bases for U.N. 
troop exercises, participate in the organization of study visits 
and continue to cooperate in the military actions of U.N. 
peace-keeping forces.

  [Text] Prague May 12 (CTK) -- During their meeting today, 
Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and his Slovenian 
counterpart Lojze Peterle signed a cooperation agreement 
covering education, culture and science, they told journalists. 
  They also talked about the Stability Pact to be signed at 
the 
coming meeting of European foreign ministers in Paris and looked 
at questions of bilateral trade, they said. 
  Trade between the two countries, which have signed a free 
trade zone agreement, has been growing rapidly, with Czech 
exports to Slovenia in the first eight months of last year 
valued at $78 million and Slovenian exports to the Czech 
Republic over the same period amounting to $33 million. 
  Peterle, who started his official two-day visit to the Czech 
Republic today, also met President Vaclav Havel and Parliament 
Chairman Milan Uhde. He will be visiting a Prague Castle 
exhibition about Josip Plecnik, Slovenian architect who worked 
in Czechoslovakia between the two world wars and designed 
alterations to the Castle and its gardens. 
  The ministers agreed on furthering cultural links. The Czech 
Republic is to organise a Czech cultural festival in Ljubljana.

  [Text] Prague May 12 (CTK) -- The United Nations-imposed 
arms embargo is a problem concerning all countries of the former 
Yugoslavia, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec reported his 
Slovenian counterpart Lojze Peterle as saying at their meeting 
today. 
  Peterle is on a two-day official visit to the Czech 
Republic. 
  It is unlikely that the UN Security Council would agree to 
lift the embargo for one country only, Zieleniec said. 
  However, the question might eventually get onto the 
Council's 
agenda. "The fundamental thing is whether Slovenia will be able 
to control the movement of weapons over its territory," he said.

  [Text] Prague May 12 (CTK) -- The Czech-Slovenian free 
zone agreement will be ratified by parliament as soon as 
possible, Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde said today at his 
meeting with Slovenian Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle. 
  The agreement was signed in Ljubljana on December 4, 1993. 
  Peterle and Uhde pointed to the dynamically-growing 
relations 
between the two countries. 
  Peterle said at the meeting that no open problems existed 
between the two countries and described the Czech Republic as a 
friendly country with strategic importance to Slovenia, for 
which the Czech Republic is the most important partner. 
  He said that Slovenia and the Czech Republic shared views on 
entering the European Union as sovereign countries wanting to 
share in the making of Europe. 
  Uhde criticised attempts at dividing Europe into spheres of 
interest. Peterle said that the idea "leads to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," adding that if particular pressures had not 
been at play there, the country's problems would have been 
solved a long time ago. 
  "We want a Europe and not a package of interest spheres," 
Peterle added.

  [Text] Budapest, May 12 (MTI) -- Gyula Horn, chairman of 
the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), left Borsod county 
hospital in Miskolc in a reassuring condition today, hospital 
director Zoltan Katona told MTI. On May 5, the car carrying 
Horn back to Budapest from an election rally in Miskolc ran into 
a truck parked on road No. 3 between Nyekladhaza and Emod. The 
party chairman suffered a fractured cervical vertebra, a broken 
wrist and a concussion in the crash. 
  Dr. Katona said Horn is in quite a good condition, and he is 
returning to his family in Budapest. He will invariably need 
longer-term outpatient care and must undergo rehabilitation 
treatment, Katona added. Driver Istvan Mosolygo and the other 
passenger Jeno Zsidey have also left the hospital.

  [Text] Budapest, 11 May (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ) believes that the results of the first round 
of parliamentary elections held in Hungary on May 8 were greatly 
influenced by the operation of Hungarian Radio and Hungarian 
Television. ``The majority of the citizens receive their 
information from the electronic media, and it was here that the 
differences in the parties' manifestos could not be greatly 
elaborated. 
  "The new government must settle the situation of the media 
after the elections, and it must dismiss the vice-presidents of 
Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television, Laszlo Csucs and Gabor 
Nahlik, because they both worked in a manner contradictory to 
public service norms. New presidents and vice-presidents must 
be appointed to head Radio and Television, in order for them to 
consolidate the institutions." 
  The above was how SZDSZ executive Peter Hack evaluated the 
media situation in a meeting with the press in Budapest on 
Wednesday [11 May], prior to holding a discussion with Dutch 
students studying the media. 
  According to Hack, there are good reasons for Dutch students 
to gather information in Hungary, as the media situation in the 
country can be instructive, similar to the often mentioned 
"veterinarian horse". 
  The SZDSZ politician said the new Parliament must enact the 
media law by October at the latest. The law should create the 
conditions for commercial radio and television so that open 
bidding can take place early next year. 
  The Free Democrats believe the state should keep an 
earth-based television channel and a satellite channel, while 
two earth-based channels could be privatized for 10 to 15 years, 
based on a concession tender. The SZDSZ believes it justified 
to have two public service radio channels: Kossuth station and 
the cultural station Bartok, with private radios broadcasting on 
the other frequencies.

People's Party [KDNP] has asked its supporters and those of 
parties with a similar way of thinking to support the candidates 
of "nationally committed political forces" who qualified for the 
May 29 run-off of the parliamentary elections, the KDNP 
Executive Committee said today. The committee did not name any 
specific party in the appeal. 
  After the committee's session, KDNP Chairman Laszlo Surjan 
said he had agreed with Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] Deputy 
Chairman Peter Boross and Chairman Lajos Fur on a proposal that 
an MDF candidate should withdraw in favor of a KDNP candidate in 
Nograd county, while a KDNP candidate should withdraw in favor 
of an MDF candidate in Nyirbator.

  [Text] Budapest, 11 May (MTI) -- The National Election 
Committee has received no applications for legal remedy 
concerning the elections so far, the Interior Ministry's 
Election Office informed MTI on Wednesday [11 May]. 
  The election office has stated that the second round of the 
elections may be entered by individual candidates who received 
at least 15 percent of the vote in the first round. 
  If there is no such candidate, the three with the most votes 
will be in the running. In this way, there will be 
constituencies where candidates can enter even though they may 
have only acquired seven percent in the May 8 round. 
  In the first round, two individual deputies received enough 
votes to win straight out of the gate, and 125 party-list 
mandates were decided. The race for the other 259 (out of the 
total 386) seats is to continue in the second round. This 
includes 174 individual mandates, and a further 85 resulting 
from leftover votes. 
  The deputy contest is thus heating up in 174 of the 176 
individual constituencies. Balloting will be valid if voter 
turnout exceeds 25 percent by even one person. 
  What are leftover votes? -- 27 mandates will be distributed 
among parties winning more than 5 percent of votes cast for 152 
regional lists. National party-lists will determine 58 mandates 
to be allotted by complicated mathematical calculations on the 
basis of leftover votes for individual candidates. This means 
that a total of 85 parliamentary seats will be awarded on the 
basis of fractional votes cast for the six parties. 
  An order was previously established by drawing lots for the 
six parliamentary parties on the national list in the event that 
two parties get the same number of leftover votes. In this 
case, the mandate will go to the party that ranks higher on the 
national list.

Chief of Staff of the Chinese Army General Zhang Wannian on 
Thursday and said "It would be beautiful for Poland" if there 
was a Polish-Chinese alliance. "I am very pleased that I will 
become acquainted with the point of view of a great state, a 
great army on what is happening in Europe," Walesa said. The 
chief of staff of the Polish army, General Tadeusz Wilecki 
attended the meeting. 
  "After these great changes, attempted changes, we are in a 
quite strange and unclear situation," Walesa said, commenting on 
the feeling of insecurity among the countries of central and 
eastern Europe. "It is true that the Soviet Union no longer 
exists but there are other countries which have nuclear weapons 
at their disposal. We are searching for security. We are 
searching for an alliance which could guarantee this security," 
Walesa explained adding that it would be beautiful if there were 
such an alliance with China.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 11 -- Presidential Spokesman Andrzej 
Drzycimski on Wednesday [11 May] accused public television of 
"skewing information on the functioning of supreme state organs" 
in a letter addressed to the National Radio and Television 
Council (KRRIT). In the letter, addressed to head of the KRRIT 
Ryszard Bender, Drzycimski wrote: "After having watched 
Tuesday's main news bulletin (on public TV channel 1, ed.), I 
came to the conclusion that I can no longer remain silent." 
  In his opinion, the lack of television coverage of Walesa's 
return from his official visit to Estonia and his press 
conference at the airport, infringed not only the law on radio 
and TV but also "all principles that public television should 
adhere to." Terming as "scandalous" the treatment of the head 
of state by Polish television on Tuesday, Drzycimski also 
recalled a "superficial coverage" of Walesa's visit to India, a 
tendentious selection of fragments of Walesa's recent talks with 
the Democratic Left alliance (SLD) caucus and serious mistakes 
in reports on his visit to Lithuania. 
  Drzycimski expressed the hope that the KRRIT would take 
measures to prevent "such scandalous incidents" from happening. 
The KRRIT on Wednesday discussed Drzycimski's letter.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 11/5/1994 -- Referring to the 
first round of the elections recently held in Hungary, the 
spokesman for the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mircea 
Geoana told a press conference on 11 May that "in order to have 
a complete and definitive picture of the Hungarian Parliament's 
composition, and, consequently, of the government to be 
appointed, we need to see the results of the second round. It 
is obvious however that the Socialist Party is heading for 
victory." 
  About the Romanian-Hungarian relations once socialists 
accede 
to power, the Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the 
socialists' statements in the pre-election period were already 
known. "They voiced a constructive approach the Socialist Party 
intended to have if, elections over, they gained access to the 
ruling structures," Mircea Geoana said. He also said that the 
Romanian side received such statements with interest and that 
"the Romanian authorities are waiting to see the outcome of the 
electoral process in Hungary, with a view to identifying, 
jointly with the new Hungarian Government, the concrete means to 
continue the negotiations on the framework political treaty, and 
on the bilateral relations as a whole." 
  According to information furnished by the spokesman for the 
Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mircea Geoana, the 
president of the European Parliament, Egon Klepsch is expected 
on an official visit to Romania on 16-17 May this year at the 
invitation of the Romanian Parliament. The head of the European 
Parliament will have meetings with the speakers of the two 
houses of the Romanian Parliament, with members of the Foreign 
Policy Committees, and with the Romanian parliamentary 
delegation to the European Parliament. He will also meet with 
leaders of the parliamentary groups, the chairman of the Council 
for Economic Coordination, Strategy and Reform, and the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs. Egon Klepsch will deliver a speech before a 
joint sitting of parliament, and will be received by the 
president of Romania. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman also informed the press that 
the president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, will 
be the guest of Romania on 2-4 June, at the invitation of Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  In the same line, the spokesman announced that the European 
Parliament approved in its plenary meeting the recommendation of 
the European Commission for a ECU 125,000,000 credit to Romania, 
representing the quota underwritten by the European Union from 
the $300,000,000 loan officially applied for by the Romanian 
Government to the G-24 with the purpose of compensating the 
balance of payments and financing the economic reform over 
1993-1994.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 12/5/1994 -- Romania counts at 
present on a 269,500 strong army. The reform will reduce their 
number to 230,000 by 1995 and to 200,000 by the end of the year 
2000, Lieutenant-General Dumitru Cioflina, defence secretary of 
state and chief of the Army's General Staff, told a news 
conference today. The reform will also mean a higher level of 
professionalisation of its military who by 2000 will be 
permanent and highly trained in a proportion of 50 percent. 
  The chief of the general staff gave a number of details as 
to 
the reform. This is to be carried out by restructuring its 
bodies in two phases: one ended in 1993, the latter will last 
until 2000. The reform and restructuring includes the reduction 
of armament in compliance with Romania's international 
commitments: tanks from 2,850 to 1,375 in 1995, 100 mm and more 
artillery pieces from 3,780 to 1,475, armoured cars from 3,100 
to 2,100, fighter planes from 505 to 430. Attack helicopters 
are planned to grow in number from 13 as of now to 120. 
  General Cioflina revealed plans to set up a 100,000 strong 
protection corps formed of territorial forces (similar to the 
former civic guards), which will add up to the national defence 
system consisting of regular army, gendarmes, police, frontier 
guards and fire fighter corps. According to the Romanian senior 
military official, the Army's budget is 75 percent of minimal 
requirements, and it covers the purchase of new armament, the 
maintenance of the old one, the entire wage and outfit expenses. 
  General Cioflina mentioned descentralisation as one of the 
effects of the reform, with responsibilities relegated from 
minister to the staffs of the three armies and to the general 
staff. This includes the creation of an intervention force 
formed of armoured car brigades, three paratroopers brigades, 
tank and artillery divisions. 
  The reform and the restructuring, Secretary of State General 
Cioflina admitted, caused some apprehension among military who 
fear that they might be either put on the reserve or reassigned 
to other garrisons. Among other tasks devolving upon the Army 
General Cioflina mentioned its duty "to defend the democratic 
order," a constitutional provision to be found in other 
constitutions as well, with the difference that, as concerns the 
Romanian Constitution, specifications must be made as to the 
moment and mode of intervention. To complement this, two laws 
are being drafted at present: the law of the state of siege, 
and the law of the state of emergency, meant to clarify an issue 
that has caused so much heated debate starting with the 
intervention of the Army in December 1989.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 11 (CTK) -- The Foreign Ministry 
expressed the hope today that the next Hungarian Government 
would assume a more accommodating approach to resolving problems 
existing between the two countries. "It is in Slovakia's 
interest that the government which will emerge from the 
parliamentary elections in Hungary be communicative, ready for 
constructive dialogue, with a realistic approach to resolving 
bilateral questions and to developing relations between the two 
countries," the press release says. 
  "The Slovak Foreign Ministry believes that the new Hungarian 
Government will continue in the political and social changes it 
has started and its foreign policy will stem from rational 
positions," the release concludes. 
  The tension in the Bratislava-Budapest relations has eased 
somewhat after Jozef Moravcik's new government was appointed on 
March 16. He acknowledged his willingness to conduct a dialogue 
with his counterpart Peter Boross, and Boross's rivals Gyula 
Horn and Gabor Kuncze. Bratislava hopes that it will conclude 
with the new Hungarian Government the basic state treaty on 
inviolability of border which Budapest has so far refused, 
making the treaty conditional on extending the rights of ethnic 
Hungarians.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 11 (CTK) -- The Slovak Foreign 
Ministry reiterated its willingness to continue talks with 
Budapest on the division of the Danube's waters between the 
Gabcikovo derivation canal on Slovakia's territory and the 
Danube's old course, in a note extended to the Hungarian Embassy 
today, the ministry told CTK. 
  The Ministry proposed that talks take place on May 18-19 in 
Bratislava. "It is already the second date proposed by the 
ministry for talks on the temporary water regime on the river 
and it would therefore welcome it if the Hungarian side said it 
was ready for such talks," the note says. It says that such 
talks should help achieve goals proposed by the European Union 
(EU) experts. "It is necessary, however, to take into account 
the possibilities of technical realization and economic impact 
of individual solutions," the note says. 
  Beside the dispute over the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project 
itself which was taken to the International Court of Justice in 
The Hague last July, Bratislava and Budapest are also in 
disagreement over the temporary water regime on the Danube to 
function until a verdict is passed in The Hague. 
  Hungary demands that Slovakia let more water to flow into 
the 
Danube's old course even at the cost of restricting electricity 
production at Gabcikovo, while Slovak experts say that the 
improvement of the state of the Danube's tributaries on the 
Hungarian side which are drying up does not so much depend on 
the flow of water but rather on the construction of the system 
of weirs which would raise the water level to such an extent as 
it flows also into the tributaries. However, the Hungarian 
Parliament rejected the construction of the weirs and decided to 
supply the tributaries with water with the help of pumps. An 
attempt to reach a compromise undertaken by EU Commission 
experts has so far failed. 
  Nevertheless, Bratislava made it clear it is willing to be 
accommodating when during a meeting of the two countries' 
environment ministers in mid-April in Bratislava Juraj Hrasko 
promised to his Hungarian counterpart to double the amount of 
water flowing through Mosoni-Duna tributary on Hungarian 
territory as of May 15.

  [Excerpts] Bratislava, May 12 (CTK) -- There does exist an 
agreement between the Hungarian minority and Jozef Moravcik's 
anti-Slovak government, Eva Slavkovska from the Slovak National 
Party (SNS) said calling the agreement an arrogant proclamation 
of the minority's effort at self-rule in southern Slovakia. "I 
am calling on all Slovaks to say a decisive `no' to turning the 
Slovaks in southern Slovakia into a minority," Slavkovska, SNS 
first deputy chairwoman, said. She also protested against "the 
Hungarians' effort to make decisions" on who should hold public 
administration posts. "Let them go vetting elsewhere, they will 
not be doing this in Slovakia," she stressed. 
  The SNS is a former coalition government partner of Vladimir 
Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). They claim 
that the new government, appointed on April 16, has concluded a 
secret agreement with the Hungarian parties trading government 
support for concessions made to the ethnic minority. About 
560,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia, making up about 11 
per cent of the total population. 
  Peter Sokol, adviser to the SNS chairman, said that by its 
deeds, the present government was running counter to its 
proclamations that it was calming down the social situation in 
the country. [passage omitted] Sokol said that "social peace is 
the fundamental prerequisite of a successful economic 
transformation in Slovakia." He said his party agreed with the 
proposal that parties' election expenditures do not exceed 20 
million crowns ($606,060). "Our expenditures have never gone 
beyond five million," he added.

  [Text] Bratislava May 12 (CTK) -- Slovak ex-Premier 
Vladimir Meciar's "shadow" cabinet strongly criticised a drafted 
amendment to the election law at a press conference today. The 
amendment will enable Slovak citizens who do not permanently 
reside in Slovakia to participate in the elections providing 
they vote in Slovakia. 
  Ex-Justice Minister Katarina Tothova said that the amendment 
did not stipulate any registration of these citizens, so 
theoretically they could vote in as many constituencies as the 
transport system allowed them to get to. 
  Ex-Finance Minister Julius Toth said that citizens were 
allowed to vote several times in various constituencies 
providing they had valid federal passports and claimed they had 
permanent residence in the Czech Republic. "We are likely to 
have more voters in Slovakia than citizens," Toth said. 
  Tothova said that the electoral law also had holes in that 
it 
enabled politicians to run on another party's ticket without 
their describing themselves as independent candidates or 
creating a coalition with the party for which they would run. 
Theoretically, this would mean that parliament could be entered 
by parties which would otherwise not stand a chance. 
  The government Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) of Jan 
Carnogursky has recently offered to individual politicians from 
other right-wing parties to run on a KDH ticket.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 12 (CTK) -- "It is theoretically 
possible that Slovakia will not sign the stability pact, but I 
can imagine such an extreme situation only with difficulties," 
Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan told journalists today. 
The pact of European stability and security, based on a plan of 
French Premier Edouard Balladur and approved by the European 
Union (EU), counts on the participation of the EU "Twelve", the 
USA and Canada. The pact's main goal is to preventively settle 
problems concerning borders and ethnic minorities in former 
post-communist countries. 
  Kukan confirmed that Slovak diplomacy "has hardened its 
position" and wanted to push through the inclusion of Slovak 
interests into the pact. Slovakia's main reservation concerns 
the provision that Slovakia and Hungary should settle mutual 
problems with EU assistance. "We do not want anybody third to 
dictate to us what to do about our bilateral relations. The 
pact clearly says that the agreement is to be concluded under EU 
sponsorship, and sets a concrete date. This would mean that we 
(Slovakia and Hungary) cannot negotiate on a bilateral level, 
but must ask a third side. We do not like this and want to 
change it," Kukan said. He added Slovakia was willing to accept 
a more compromising wording of the relevant document. 
  Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik, who is to leave for a visit 
to 
France on Monday [16 May], is expected to hold talks on the 
pact. Kukan said he would like Slovak diplomats to push through 
an acceptable wording of the document before Moravcik's visit. 
Asked if Slovak representatives would attend a Paris conference 
on the project to be held later in May, Kukan said: "If the pact 
does not fully correspond to our interests, we will consider on 
which level we will take part in it."

  [Text] Bratislava May 13 (CTK) -- "Hardly have we started 
to appear and already problems are upon us," the revamped 
SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA (SLOVAK REPUBLIC) complains on its front 
page today. The daily, close to the former premier, Vladimir 
Meciar, used to be published as REPUBLIKA by the News Agency of 
the Slovak Republic (TA SR) but came out on Thursday [12 May] 
with a new name and the old layout. It is published now by the 
Salus limited company, which is co-owned by Meciar's Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). 
  The paper reports that Pavol Weiss, a leader of the Liberal 
Party, has lodged a complaint with the General Prosecutor's 
Office to investigate whether the paper has committed the 
criminal act of public defamation of the republic by its new 
name. At the same time, the culture minister has asked the 
publisher to change the name, although the abuse of the state 
name is only theoretical. 
  On May 12, TA SR Director General Ivan Melichercik said that 
REPUBLIKA was originally intended to be purely a news agency 
paper but owing to its marked political bias it became 
"incompatible with the fundamental principles of a news agency". 
  From the beginning of its existence REPUBLIKA "dragged a 
boulder of debts behind it"; this contradicted TA SR's legally 
defined status as a public corporation, which is not permitted 
any loss-making entrepreneurial activity. "TA SR's divorce from 
REPUBLIKA proceeds solely from these premises," Melichercik 
stated.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 12 (CTK) -- The "Meciarite" 
REPUBLIKA appears today with a new name, SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, 
and a new publisher: no longer the Slovak News Agency TA SR but 
now Salus, a company in which Vladimir Meciar's party, the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), has a stake. 
  In an article entitled "Divorce After 406 days" TA SR 
director general Ivan Melichercik writes that REPUBLIKA was 
originally intended to be purely a news agency paper but owing 
to its marked political bias it became "incompatible with the 
fundamental principles of a news agency." 
  From the beginning of its existence REPUBLIKA "dragged a 
boulder of debts behind it"; this contradicted TA SR's legally 
defined status as a public corporation, which is not permitted 
any loss-making entrepreneurial activity. "TA SR's divorce from 
REPUBLIKA proceeds solely from these premises," Melichercik 
writes. 
  Jan Smolec, who remains editor-in-chief of the new 
publication, comments that "leading politicians of the 
government coalition demonstrated in March how a person can be 
hounded out of office with the aid of an intrigue," alluding to 
the unseating of Premier Vladimir Meciar by a vote of 
no-confidence. "Politicians who wanted (Slovak) independence are 
subjected to attack after attack," he writes. 
  "Intrigues, dishonour, corruption are becoming commonplace 
in 
Slovakia. Slovak independence is under threat. That's why 
there have to be newspapers which defend Slovak interests, 
honourable and incorruptible politicians," he writes. 
  Smolec concludes his article by thanking readers who have 
donated a million Slovak crowns ($30,000) thereby enabling the 
editors to continue in the same political vein as before, as the 
"only opposition daily on the media market."

  [Text] Bratislava, May 11 (CTK) -- The lustration 
[screening] law in Slovakia should be amended so that it 
corresponds to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, 
Democratic Left Party (SDL) Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik told 
CTK today. The greatest shortcoming of the law was that it did 
not respect the need for the court protection of citizens who 
were unjustly accused of having collaborated with the former 
Communist secret police (StB), Ftacnik said. 
  "International institutions also blamed us because the law 
does not set down the possibility of court protection," he said. 
Many of the people who received a positive lustration 
certificate appealed to the court and were vindicated, he added. 
  The lustration or screening law, which was passed by the 
now-defunct Czechoslovak federal parliament in 1991 and assumed 
by its two successor states -- the Czech and Slovak republics 
after Czechoslovakia's division in 1993, bars former Communist 
Party officials, StB agents and collaborators, and People's 
Militia members from high economic and political posts until 
1996. 
  The problem of lustration in Slovakia became urgent after 
information leaked out to the public that one of the ministers 
in the current Slovak cabinet of Premier Jozef Moravcik had 
failed the screening process. According to the Slovak press, 
Minister of the Economy Peter Magvasi who was nominated to the 
cabinet by the SDL may be having problems with the screening. 
Magvasi, however, in an interview with CTK denied his alleged 
cooperation with StB. 
  The former Slovak Government of Vladimir Meciar requested 
the 
Slovak Constitutional Court in the middle of January to start 
investigations into allegedly major discrepancies between the 
screening law and the Slovak Constitution. The Constitutional 
Court, however, rejected the request on May 10, arguing that it 
declined to deal with the proposal of government which had 
subsequently fallen, since the court had already made a decision 
on the matter once. 
  The lustration law in Slovakia remains valid, although no 
official body has been empowered with issuing lustration 
certificates. Under the regulation of Meciar's cabinet the 
Slovak Information Service (SIS) has thus far been dealing with 
the issue, however the regulations became invalid nine months 
after the division of the federation. A law should have been 
then passed to establish a body for carrying out lustration but 
such a law had not been passed. Therefore there is no body to 
implement the screening of Moravcik's government members as 
Moravcik had asked shortly after the new government was 
appointed. The coalition parties are considering amending the 
law on the SIS to empower it to issue lustration certificates. 
  Ftacnik told CTK that the Coalition Council did not reach 
any 
decision on the issue at its meeting today. He said that 
Meciar's government had a bill ready last September which would 
have also specified the body responsible for lustration. "The 
bill was then withdrawn but for which reasons -- that is not a 
question for me," he said.

  [Text] Tirana, May 10 (ATA) -- The ten accused Albanians on 
the charges of "conspiracy in subversive activity" in the 
Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM] will continue to stay in detention, because their 
trial planned for May 9 was postponed, reports Albanian TV, 
according to the information from Skopje. The reason for the 
postponement of the trial for the second time is the 
continuation of attorneys' strike. The trial will start on May 
23. In the Albanian opinion prevails the idea that this is a 
fabricated case were facts are missing to verify their charges.

  [Text] Tirana, May 11 (ATA) -- The vice president of the 
Party for Democratic Prosperity [PDP], Mendu Thaci, recently met 
in Tetova with CSCE representatives and informed them of the 
difficulties his party is facing, sources from Skopje reported 
yesterday. 
  Mr. Thaci informed the CSCE representatives of the grave 
situation of the Albanian schools in The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. "In the 1981 there were 38 
Albanian middle schools while now they have been reduced in 5. 
Only 2.8 percent of the Skopje University are Albanians while 
Albanians make up only 2.4 percent of the police workers. Among 
250,000 titles of books at the Skopje Popular Library only 150 
are in Albanian language," Mr. Thaci informed the CSCE 
representatives. 
  "Even Albanians make up one third of the total population, 
they are considered in the Constitution as an insignificant 
minority," Mr. Thaci said adding that "though they were under 
discriminating laws they approved the statement for the 
independence of Macedonia and recognized both its existence and 
that of the Macedonian people."

  [Text] Tirana, May 10 (ATA) -- Large units of Serbian 
military forces have engaged in a series of military exercises 
in the villages of Dubovc, Galice, and Mikushnice of Vushtrri, 
apparently to train troops for combat in populated areas, 
according to reports of the Council for the Defence of Human 
Rights and Freedoms from Prishtina. Mass concentrations of 
Serbian military forces and their movement have created a tense 
situation in the above said villages and regions around, because 
Serbian soldiers are also using fire weapons during the 
exercises. 
  The "Azem Bejtja" School yard in Dubovc, its grounds as well 
as the territories of the former mine have turned into areas 
mined by the Serbian soldiers, creating hazards for the 
Albanians residing in these areas. Situations of this kind have 
also been created in Skenderaj, with dozens of Serbian soldiers 
and their dogs standing in front of the houses of Mikushice's 
inhabitants shooting incessantly with fire weapons. 
  The Council for the Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms 
also 
reports that about 300 Serbian troops have engaged in military 
exercises with mechanised means in Sibovc of the Podujeve 
commune. Military concentrations have been noticed recently also 
in Necavc, near Hani i Elezit, with soldiers openly provoking 
Albanians and grabbing their cattle. 
  The mass concentrations of military troops and their 
engagement in exercises show of an escalation of military 
tension, besides that of the police, which are of dangerous 
consequences not only for the inhabitants of the said areas but 
also of the areas beyond. This also testifies to the fact that 
now, with the Kosova question being on the agenda of the 
international organisations to solve it through peaceful ways, 
Belgrade is determined to follow the track of war.

  [Text] The first day of the Sixth National Conference of 
the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] was devoted to statements 
by the chairmen of the parties, members of the SDS coalition, 
and delegates to the conference. Two main issues were brought 
up: tactics related to prompting early elections and the 
centers of power within the SDS. 
  Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the SDS National Coordinating 
Council, said elections are the only prudent alternative for 
Bulgaria's fate. However, he himself sees no real evidence that 
elections could take place by the end of the year. He appealed 
for unity within the SDS. 
  Stefan Savov, chairman of the SDS parliamentary faction, 
said 
that the parliament is the heart of democracy. According to 
him, the blue [SDS] deputies blocked many recommunization bills, 
and they should continue to do so. 
  According to Radical Democratic Party Chairman Aleksandur 
Yordanov, the SDS faces both elections and a choice: whether to 
proceed toward a split or to head along the road of unity. 
Yordanov said that the presidency was seen for a long time as 
the basic enemy of the SDS, but this position has changed. 
  The Radical Democrats, the Nikola Petkov Bulgarian Agrarian 
National Union [BZNS], the Democratic Party, and the Christian 
Democratic Center Union expressed the joint stance that the 
parliamentary boycott is a means and not an end in itself, and 
that it should be effected at an appropriate moment along with 
extraparliamentary pressure. 
  The opposition of Ecoglasnost, the Conservative-Ecological 
Party, and certain local structures of the SDS did not surprise 
anyone. They demanded an immediate walkout from the parliament. 
Edvin Sugarev insisted that the conference should impose a 
decision on the parliamentary faction to boycott the parliament 
if the cabinet is successfully reshuffled. In this context, the 
old problem of the SDS coalition related to the centers of power 
emerged again. The Social Democrats of Ivan Kurtev proposed a 
single center of power -- the coalition's political organ and 
the national conference. They should be the only organs 
entitled to adopt political decisions. 
  All those proposals will be incorporated in the program 
document, which the conference will adopt tomorrow. However, 
there are clear indications that the boycott of the parliament 
will be postponed, while the centralization of power within the 
coalition will be carried out. 
  The BZNS of Anastasiya Mozer, the Monarchists, and the 
Christian Democratic Party were mentioned favorably as possible 
partners in a future coalition.

  [Text] The delegates to the Sixth National Conference of 
the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], which ended yesterday, 
supported the following conclusion, presented by SDS leader 
Filip Dimitrov: 
  [Begin Dimitrov recording] There is no other prudent 
solution for Bulgaria other than holding early elections as soon 
as possible. This is a conclusion prompted not by the interests 
of the SDS as a political formation, but by the need to lead 
Bulgaria out of the critical situation in which it finds itself, 
and the grave consequences of the rule of the present 
government. Therefore it is necessary to effect a decisive 
change, prompted by a new political will that is able to 
implement changes in the direction of the reforms -- a direction 
the SDS advocates in the name of the nation. 
  The SDS National Conference discussed the issue of adopting 
a 
categorical position against the existing government and the 
creation of a similar one, and against continuing the activity 
of the current parliament. The SDS's decisive organs are the 
conference and the National Coordinating Council. [end 
recording] 
  According to the changes in the SDS statute as adopted by 
the 
conference, certain restricting texts were adopted regarding the 
future SDS people's representatives. Those texts apply also to 
the current members of the National Coordinating Council. They 
cannot be former members of the Union of Active Fighters Against 
Fascism and Capitalism, active figures in the totalitarian 
regime, or people who have submitted requests to join the former 
Bulgarian Communist Party. 
  According to the document that was adopted, if the current 
government remains in office, the SDS will begin massive 
extraparliamentary protest actions, combined with a 
parliamentary boycott. The forms of those actions are yet to be 
specified.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jaroslav Basta, chairman of the Czech Social </F>
Democratic Party Security Commission, by Jaroslav Fiala; place 
and date not given: "Law Against Organized Crime Is Necessary"] 
  [Text] We spoke with Jaroslav Basta, chairman of the Czech 
Social Democratic Party Security Commission, about the 
development of organized crime in our Republic in connection 
with the situation in Russia. 
  [Fiala] One often speaks about growth of organized crime in 
Russia. How strongly is this growth influenced by the political 
situation there, in your opinion? 
  [Basta] The situation in Russia is different and more 
serious than it is being presented in our Republic. The 
traditional democratic division of power in the form of the 
government-president-parliament triangle does not work there. 
The government's powers are very small because many of them 
have been transferred to the parliament and president. The 
president has so many powers, however, that he is unable to 
exercise them, and, as a result, these powers are exercised by 
people who are not even constitutional officials. A great many 
of them come from the "apparatus" and have behind them the 
"standard career"--that is, about 20 years in the KGB and its 
successor organizations. 
  [Fiala] Many of these people have left the security forces, 
however, to become entrepreneurs, for instance. What role do 
they plan in organized crime in Russia? Is the situation in our 
Republic similar in any way? 
  [Basta] Each such operative lived in a certain ghetto and, 
the more his activity had to do with the security of the state, 
the more secluded he was in this ghetto. His only contacts were 
his fellow workers and his clients. When you look at the way 
these people run their businesses, you find out that they employ 
colleagues from their branch or their former agents in their 
firms. When they worked in the past on something pertaining to 
the protection of the economy, this becomes extremely dangerous. 
Essentially, they have contacts at the Ministry of Interior, in 
the KGB successor organizations, and in the underworld. For 
example, 10 functionaries of the Ministry of Interior who had 
been involved in organized crime were arrested in Russia in 
April. Moreover, the Russian secret services have started to 
officially promote the possibility of acquiring money outside 
the budget. The budget is one of the most important means of 
subjecting these services to control. If they are able to 
generate resources outside the budget, they become 
uncontrollable. Machinations with various technologies--for 
example, with radioactive materials--show how they obtain these 
resources. All research institutes, factories, and installations 
dealing with those materials are under the KGB's permanent 
control. Whenever anything gets lost anywhere, it does not 
happen without the knowledge of its former staffers. They are 
mostly involved in this [cases of disappearance of radioactive 
substances]. and I believe they are making use for this purpose 
of agents with whom they used to cooperate. 
  [Fiala] Are the conditions for organized crime any different 
in our country and other postcommunist countries than they are 
in advanced states? 
  [Basta] What makes us different from the West is that, for 
several decades, we did not live in a state based on the rule of 
law. Ethics did not exist here, and, instead of the rule of 
ethics and the law, we had the rule of anxiety. This anxiety is 
now gone and people behave the way they logically must behave 
because the state based on the rule of law is not ingrained in 
them and some believe that everything is permitted. This is the 
ideal environment for the emergence of organized crime. I am 
not afraid of organized crime that comes to our country from the 
West because, compared with what is in store for us, this 
organized crime is civilized and less dangerous. When someone 
who used to work for some security service embarks upon the path 
of organized crime, he has a great many advantages, compared 
with ordinary criminals. He knows how the police work and what 
course the investigation will take, and he is more qualified 
than an ordinary criminal. When people who were always 
criminals begin to engage in organized crime here, it is far 
more dangerous than in the West. The local brand [of organized 
crime] will have communist roots because it will be organized by 
people who were working in criminal organizations such as the 
StB [State Security Corps]. The combination of the underworld 
and people who worked at the Federal Ministry of Interior, for 
example, is immensely dangerous. Those who used to organize 
crime legally, under the cover of the communist regime, will now 
organize it illegally. For this reason, I assess negatively the 
Interior Ministry's claim that there is no need for laws against 
organized crime in our country. 
  [Fiala] Wherein lies a solution to the situation, in your 
opinion? 
  [Basta] We have only one chance--to join the coordinated 
struggle against organized crime, alongside other states. For 
this to happen, we must, first and foremost, make our laws 
compatible with the legislative norms adopted by the European 
Union [EU]. This concerns, for example, the convention on the 
laundering of dirty money, which the European Union adopted in 
1988. Our Republic has not adopted this convention, and it 
seems that it will not adopt it, either. The longer we are a 
laundry for dirty money, the worse our situation in the security 
sphere and the worse our international position will become. We 
should build without delay a state based on the rule of law, 
complete with all the legislation this entails, including a law 
against organized crime.

<F P=106> [Article by Vlasta Hlusickova: "Army Does Not Demand Payment </F>
of Debts"] 
  [Text] State property is being sold 
without regard for law and government edicts. The Ministry of 
Defense in not interested in 11 million korunas? The Supreme 
Control Office will now take a good look at the sale of 
arms. 
  The Supreme Control Office [NKU] found frequent breaches of 
laws and government edicts in the way the Czech Republic Army 
has been handling its surplus and unusable property in the 
period 1990 to 1993. Irregularities were found in almost all of 
the audited Army units as well as in the Ministry of Defense. 
  The greatest number of irregularities was found in the Army 
Housing and Construction Administration (VUSS) Plzen, which, in 
addition to selling the chateaux Struzna and Kanice, broke the 
law on historical monuments by not first giving the state the 
option of purchasing these cultural monuments. The same law was 
broken by VUSS Tabor by its sale of the Neznasov chateau. The 
Plzen VUSS further broke the Ministry of Finance regulation on 
the management of national property by its transfer of the 
Vysocany barracks, the Dobrany billets, the Plzen exhibition 
grounds, and the barracks in Tachov and Rokycany. It transferred 
the chateau Zelena Hora-Nepomuk, including the training grounds, 
without a certificate from the Ministry of Finance approving the 
free transfer. 
  The Army unit in Olomouc sold engineering material for more 
than 3.5 million Czech korunas [Kc] without obtaining approval 
from the government, and, subsequently, for more than Kc2 
million without submitting it to public bidding. VUSS Brno sold 
the building at its training center for Kc1.6 million without 
being granted a special permit by the government. 
  The NKU also found shortcomings in the handling of the 
government's claims. VUSS Plzen has not demanded the payment of 
rent for the lease of the grounds of the Plzen-Bory airfield, 
the Brno administration still has not been paid for the sale of 
real estate in Bilovice in the amount of Kc15 million, and 
neither was the Prague administration for the Aquacentrum 
building for Kc60 million. The Ministry of Defense has 
outstanding claims for the sale of movable assets amounting to 
more than Kc42 million. The results of the audit show that, at 
present, the Ministry of Defense is demanding the payment of 
claims in the amount of roughly Kc31 million, but, at the time 
of the audit, not of the remaining amount. 
  The Ministry of Defense used almost Kc10 million for the 
purchase of equipment for the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
unit. Moreover, all of the equipment that was purchased is still 
to be found in the Czech Republic. 
  According to the deputy press spokesman of the Ministry of 
Defense, J. Sila, the ministry has had the NKU report available 
only since Monday, and the minister will be able to make a 
statement about it only after 25 April. Sila further stated 
that, after assuming his post, Minister A. Baudys was aware that 
there have been irregularities in the sell-off of movable and 
immovable assets, and he therefore asked for his own internal 
audit of the sales. The report was turned over to the then 
prosecutor general of the Army, who, according to Sila, did not 
find any reason to institute criminal proceedings. At the same 
time, the minister decided to put in place a new system for 
selling movable and immovable assets, the rules of which would 
be fully in accord with the existing legal code. 
  The NKU spokeswoman, J. Vavrova, told ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY that 
the Ministry of Defense had the protocols concerning the results 
of the audit available already in January. On the basis of the 
present investigation, a further audit of management by the Army 
is being planned, which this time will also include the use of 
funds from the state budget and the sale of arms.

<F P=106> [Report on the meeting between Croatian and Bosnian </F>
delegations in Geneva on 13 May, including recorded remarks by 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic; Bosnian Croat 
leader Kresimir Zibak; and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate 
Granic; from the "Picture Versus Picture" program] 
  [Excerpt] The Croatian and Bosnia-Herzegovina Croat 
delegation arrived in Geneva on 13 May. They met with the 
Bosniak delegation immediately on arrival. Judging by the 
statements made after the meeting, we can expect the agreement 
to be signed successfully tomorrow, although it is still unclear 
what the territorial percentage ratio will be -- 51 to 49, as 
recommended by the international community, or 58 to 42 as 
proposed by the Bosniaks and Croats. 
  [Silajdzic] We arrived at the conclusion that we all wish to 
negotiate, that a peaceful solution would be the real solution, 
if it can be found. What awaits us now in the implementation of 
this agreement -- which has become a constitutional obligation 
-- is a series of extremely serious issues to be resolved in 
practice. 
  On the other hand, we hope that the international community 
will accept this agreement as the first step in finding a final 
peaceful solution for both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. He 
hope we can count on the international community regarding a 
just solution. This means that genocide and aggression must not 
be rewarded. 
  [Zubak] As Mr. Silajdzic said, at today's meeting we 
analyzed what we had agreed on in Vienna and reconfirmed the 
assessment that we had reached agreements in Vienna that were in 
the interests of both peoples. We also concluded that the 
reactions among the world public were positive, as well as on 
the home political scene, which instills hope and confidence 
that what was agreed in Vienna will be translated into practice 
as well. 
  After that we discussed several concrete questions. As Mr. 
Silajdzic said, we agreed to immediately form a commission 
charged with searching for missing persons. This commission 
should resolve the issue of a number of persons imprisoned in 
Bugojno and thus resolve the question of the blockade of the 
road leading across Mount Vran. We will designate this 
commission on the basis of parity and it will be constituted and 
will begin operating within seven days. We also agreed to 
convene a session of the constituent assembly of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina for the end of this month, 30 May to be 
precise, which is an approximate date [as heard], and to include 
these agreements reached in Vienna on the agenda. This means 
that we should proceed with the election of the federation's 
president, vote on laws on the government and ministries, and 
prepare other documents necessary for the implementation of the 
federation's constitution. 
  [Granic] During the two-hour long talks we discussed a 
number of important strategic issues and many vital issues of 
the relationship between the federation and Croatia. This means 
that we talked about the ways of ending the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which implies negotations between the 
federation and the third party, and a just peace, on the one 
hand and, on the other, the reintegration of the UN Protected 
Areas [UNPA's] into the legal and constitutional system of 
Croatia. Our view is that we shall coordinate many future 
actions at various levels, including the United Nations. 
  In specific terms, Croatia will not agree to the lifting of 
the embargo on Serbia unless the issue is linked with the UNPA's 
in the Republic of Croatia. 
  We also talked about the problem of succession and our joint 
approach to that issue, the issue of entry into Croatia from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the movement of convoys, border crossings, 
and the strategic problem of refugees and, in particular, the 
issue of their return, help in rehousing them, and all other 
issues of importance for ensuring that the federation can start 
functioning successfully, and also the relationship between the 
Republic of Croatia and the federation. [passage omitted on

  [Text] Geneva, May 13 (AFP) -- The foreign ministers of 
Russia, the United States and five western European countries 
ended a meeting on Bosnia-Herzegovina Friday with a call for a 
ceasefire, and negotiations between the warring parties in two 
weeks, a French diplomatic source reported. He said the 
ministers had called for the ceasefire to be "unconditional." A 
communique due to be published later in the evening would 
reiterate the ministers' support for a European Union proposal 
to divide the former Yugoslav republic on the basis of 51 
percent for Moslems and Croats and 49 percent for Serbs, the 
source said.

  [Text] The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] will only 
decide after the results of the second round of the elections on 
29 May about the candidate for prime minister. Attila Kert 
reports on this morning's consultations among the Socialists. 
  [Kert] The MSZP would like a coalition government even if -- 
on the basis of the results of the second round -- it gained an 
absolute majority in parliament, said Chairman of the Socialists 
Gyula Horn, who was today making his first public appearance 
since his accident. Horn stated before the MSZP parliamentary 
candidates: We do not want to bring into being a one-party 
government such as the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] 
conducted in the past four years. He stressed once again that 
the MSZP does not want any kind of calling to account or taking 
to task in connection with the past four years. 
  In connection with the coalition speculations, Horn stated: 
After the elections, the prime minister will be provided by the 
party that has gained the most votes. 
  In connection with this, Executive Deputy Chairman Imre 
Szekeres noted: At the coalition discussions the MSZP will wish 
to clarify four issues, and these are: the new government's 
most important concrete tasks; the shaping of the new 
governmental structure and style; the social contract to be 
concluded with employers and the employees; and finally, the 
shaping of the new relationship with the opposition. All 
personnel issues, stressed Szekeres, can only come up in terms 
of a reply to this question. If, however, the coalition 
discussions turn out to be unsuccessful, stated the MSZP's 
executive deputy chairman, the MSZP will even then undertake to 
form a government, because otherwise new elections would have to 
be called, which society, in his view, would accept only with 
great difficulty. 
  At the press briefing after the debate, Horn said the new 
government's most important constitutional tasks were the 
clarification of the sphere of competence of the president of 
the Republic; the strengthening of the parliamentary control of 
government; and the enacting of the media law. 
  Deputy Chairman Ferenc Baja described, as the most important 
characteristic of the new government's structure, the fact that 
it will be built not on personal relationships but on a 
coalition agreement, and its main task will be the realization 
of the four-year government program.

  [Text] Gyula Horn is suspicious of the circumstances of his 
6 May car accident. He referred to this yesterday at a party 
forum: 
  [Begin Horn recording] I do not know what to call this 
accident. But, to say the least, the description of what 
happened to the three of us in the car is not quite correct. 
[end recording] 
  Interior Minister Imre Konya reacted to the party chairman's 
remark last night in a statement given to a news agency: 
  In Hungarian television's "Newsreel" program yesterday, 
Gyula 
Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], 
questioned the circumstances of the accident which happened to 
him. If a party chairman is involved in an accident a few days 
before the elections, it will inevitably raise speculation. The 
thought has occurred to several people that Gyula Horn's enemies 
within the party could be behind the affair, all the more 
because the MSZP could benefit from an accident at the elections. 
  The police have no reliable information at their disposal 
which would support the idea of any kind of deliberate 
intention. However, judging from Gyula Horn's statement, one 
must draw the conclusion that the party chairman may have inside 
information from which he could have concluded that somebody 
made an attempt on his life. However, in this case, it is not 
right to make obscure statements. The evidence should be given 
to the police immediately, Interior Minister Imre Konya said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szerekes, deputy chairman of the </F>
Hungarian Socialist Party, by Grzegorz Lubczyk; place and date 
not given: "Coalition Is Not a Married Couple"] 
  [Text] [Lubczyk] Why did the Socialists receive so many 
votes in the first round of Hungarian parliamentary elections 
(on 8 May)? Was it because Hungarians support your program so 
much, or rather because they wanted to express their opposition 
to the activities of the present coalition? 
  [Szekeres] I think that there were three reasons for this 
outcome. First, vast numbers of people were indeed dissatisfied 
with the government's policy and style thus far. Second, the 
liberal forces were not able to offer an appropriate alternative 
to the coalition. And third, the four years that have passed 
were enough for the people not only to become familiar with our 
program -- they observed the behavior and approach of the party 
in various situations -- but they knew what they could expect 
from the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. We offered numerous 
examples showing that we have many experts at our disposal. I 
believe that we scored additional points for the degree of 
openness we presented. 
  [Lubczyk] At news conferences both you -- in the absence of 
Gyula Horn, who is in the hospital, you are acting as the 
party's number one man -- and your colleagues in the leadership 
of the MSZP state that you stand a good chance of forming the 
next government. 
  [Szekeres] We are realists and pragmatists. When we 
consider the possibility of forming a coalition with the Free 
Democrats, we know what the liberals can achieve, particularly 
in the area that is most important to the country: in the 
economy. On many issues our programs are convergent or similar. 
We would like to govern the country in a style different from 
the style presented by the current coalition with the Democratic 
Forum. We believe that this should be done through dialogue with 
the people; we also think that the people should be respected. 
Among our people, there are still latent forces, which are 
enormous. They must only be liberated and utilized in the 
interest of the country, which is in a crisis. 
  [Lubczyk] What then, is most important in the economy? 
  [Szekeres] Our fundamental goal is to stimulate and boost 
production, curb inflation, create new jobs, and consistently 
decrease the number of unemployed people. We also want to 
change the approach to the terrible social conditions in which 
considerable numbers of our people live, especially elderly 
persons. 
  [Lubczyk] What about foreign policy? 
  [Szekeres] Further integration with West Europe, tightening 
cooperation with our closest neighbors, and caring about the 
fate of the Hungarian minority abroad. 
  [Lubczyk] Do you include Poland among your neighbors? 
  [Szekeres] Unfortunately, we do not have a common border; 
however, I would like to emphasize that we really want to have 
good relations with your country. 
  [Lubczyk] In an interview with RZECZPOSPOLITA, Ivan Peto, 
leader of the "Free Democrats," did not rule out the possibility 
of entering into a coalition with you. However, he pointed to 
numerous differences in your two programs, which means that 
negotiations might be rather difficult. 
  [Szekeres] Well, we are different parties and so there must 
be differences. We will have experts hold interparty 
discussions and, if need be, we will look for compromises. We 
have set an initial period of six months to reach an agreement 
and work out a program of cooperation that I believe would be 
good and feasible. 
  [Lubczyk] Mathematical calculations suggest that you might 
form the new government alone. Do you not want to do that? 
  [Szekeres] Only a coalition guarantees a stable and strong 
government. Cooperation with the "Free Democrats" would broaden 
the social support for our future undertakings. If we do not 
find a partner or partners, we will have to take on this 
difficult task alone. I do not think, however, that we will be 
doing this alone. 
  [Lubczyk] You said "partners." Who else would you take into 
consideration? 
  [Szekeres] Certainly the parties of the present coalition 
are out of the question, but we have not abandoned the 
Federation of Young Democrats, "Fidesz." 
  [Lubczyk] Despite the fact that you were so fiercely 
attacked by their leader, Viktor Orban? 
  [Szekeres] You know, a coalition is not a married couple. 
  [Lubczyk] You are probably the only group which did not put 
forward its own candidate for prime minister before the 
elections. 
  [Szekeres] And we did the right thing. We wanted to show 
that what we wanted was not concrete posts and perches. When 
the final results of the elections are known, we will do this 
without such great emotions. 
  [Lubczyk] I have come across opinions among many Hungarians 
that a very good candidate, who might be acceptable for many 
parties, would be Miklos Nemeth. 
  [Szekeres] Nemeth is indeed enjoying great popularity in 
Hungary. In January, we discussed with him his participation in 
the elections. He said then that his contract with the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development would expire in the 
summer of 1995 and that he would not like to break it. We 
believe that after that he will take part in the political life 
of the country once again. 
  [Lubczyk] However, today the situation is different than the 
situation in January. If the MSZP Congress asked him to do so, 
I do not think he would refuse. I know that he came from London 
and cast his vote in Budapest. 
  [Szekeres] I have not spoken to him. Until the second round 
of elections is complete, we will not discuss the issue of a 
possible candidate for prime minister. 
  [Lubczyk] Your voters also mention Laslo Bekesi and Gyula 
Horn. 
  [Szekeres] Really, no decisions on this issue have been 
made. 
  [Lubczyk] You often say that your party is a "pragmatic 
party, without an ideology." How would you briefly characterize 
the MSZP? 
  [Szekeres] This is the correct name for what we are doing. 
We are living in a crucible of transformations, we are 
arranging things anew, as it were. Today it is a mistake to 
create an ideology that one must adjust to at a later time. I 
believe that a party such as ours should tread firmly on the 
ground, should be close to the problems of our people, should 
try to resolve them, so as to make this difficult life easier. 
Of course, we call ourselves a socialist party because we are 
striving for social justice. We want to be with those whose 
lives are difficult; we want to fight for them. 
  [Lubczyk] The name of your party includes the word 
"socialist." What is your understanding of the word? 
  [Szekeres] Solidarity with the people who -- as they say -- 
live from the work of their hands, fair distribution of duties, 
and the creation of equal opportunities.

<F P=106> [Report by Pal Szombathy: "Janosi: The MSZP Is Doomed to </F>
Coalition"] 
  [Text] The first round of the elections resulted in voting 
that changed the government, and the second round will create 
the government. This fact has to be taken into consideration 
when the government is formed. From this point of view, the 
decisive factor is that the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is 
doomed to form a coalition, as is customary in all democracies, 
MSZP Deputy Chairman Gyorgy Janosi told NEPSZABADSAG. "It is 
thought-provoking that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is 
visibly expecting an expert prime minister and the name of the 
party chairman [party not defined] is not even raised as a 
possibility in governmental roles," Janosi said. 
  Janosi said that now a democracy is needed that unites 
rather 
than divides the nation, and the political forces will also have 
to represent this. A government with the biggest possible 
social support will have to be formed because the example of the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] showed the consequences of a 
rapid loss of support, Janosi pointed out. He emphasized that 
he would consider it improper for a single party of the three 
political poles to form the new cabinet. The MSZP must strive 
for a coalition even if it exceeds the 50-percent limit, he 
stated, adding that he sees a realistic 50-percent chance of 
this. 
  In Janosi's view, the MDF implemented a one-party government 
together with two puppet partners, and proved that governing by 
one party revives the reflexes of the state party. All this can 
start a tragic erosion within the party within minutes. "We 
also have to consider the long-term interests of the left wing," 
he added. 
  For this very reason, even if the Socialists gain an 
absolute 
majority, they will have to do all they can to establish a 
multiparty government. The greater the MSZP's advantage is, the 
greater its obligation will be to make gestures and compromise 
solutions. According to Janosi, the chances of an MSZP-SZDSZ 
coalition would be greatly increased if the two parties together 
exceeded the two-thirds limit in parliament. 
  In connection with the MSZP's prime ministerial candidate, 
Janosi said that society expects the winning party to produce 
its own prime ministerial candidate. The name of the politician 
will have to be made public immediately after the second round, 
he confirmed, adding that the MSZP can only enter coalition 
talks if it has a candidate of its own. "We cannot enter into 
talks without a prime ministerial candidate, and we will have to 
produce the best possible candidate, although we do not yet know 
the result of the talks," he said. He believes that, if the 
candidate is a party politician, then the ministries can be 
given to experts, however, if the prime minister is a 
professional, then party politicians who also have professional 
expertise can be considered for the ministries. 
  According to Janosi, everything possible has to be done in 
the interest of forming a coalition, up to the final, sensible 
limit of compromises. Naturally, this limit also depends on yet 
unknown factors like the proportion of mandates and the other 
side's openness. The bigger party has to make gestures and the 
smaller one must relinquish the use of blackmail. Only this can 
establish confidence as a basis for the next four years' 
governing, Janosi said, indicating that the MSZP is not yet 
familiar with the proposals of the other side. 
  In reply to our question on [former Prime Minister] Miklos 
Nemeth, Janosi said that he can be excluded as a prime 
ministerial candidate for the MSZP, as this had been discussed 
before. However, it is possible, although the chance is small, 
that an outside third person's name will be raised as a 
compromise solution if the future coalition partners cannot 
agree. 
  Janosi expounded that society wishes for a social-liberal 
coalition that has to be placed on an as broad as possible a 
basis. Janosi previously considered the participation of the 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] a key issue, but [Fidesz 
Chairman] Viktor Orban "spectacularly closed the door," 
therefore, there is no point in thinking about this anymore. 
  In Janosi's view, the case of the Christian Democratic 
People's Party [KDNP] is completely different: Coalition with 
them can be excluded because of the difference of the programs, 
and a possible change of people in the KDNP's leadership would 
not solve this problem, either. 
  In replying to whether the MSZP wishes to create a deputy 
prime ministerial position, Janosi said that the MSZP had not 
raised this idea before because it is contrary to the program 
point advocating a cheaper state. However, the party is also 
open on this issue.

  [Excerpts] The Croatian and Bosniak delegations, in 
addition to numerous guests from the diplomatic corps in Geneva, 
were present at the ceremony to mark the Vienna agreement. At 
the end of the month, according to the Zubak-Silajdzic 
[Croat-Bosniak] agreement, the Vienna agreement will be crowned 
with the election of the president and prime minister of the 
federation and the passing of several laws on the constituent 
assembly. 
  At a Croat-Bosniak meeting with the U.S. team, which 
included, apart from Warren Christopher, Ambassadors Charles 
Redman and Victor Jackovich, U.S. ambassador to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kresimir Zubak, president of the 
Herzeg-Bosna Presidential Council, thanked the U.S. side, which 
is hoping for better coordination between the Croats and 
Bosniaks in their international statements and during the peace 
process. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President 
[addressing Zubak], what did you say to Mr. Christopher? 
  [Zubak] I only said that we have once again confirmed--by 
signing the Vienna agreements--the readiness of both peoples to 
live together in a common state, but at the same time, we 
indicated that we could solve our problems in a dignified way by 
political means; this confirms that our two peoples can also 
resolve, in this way, the problems with the third people 
[Bosnian Serbs]. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Do you know what people are interested in 
most? What is going to happen with the Serbs? Are they still 
being offered entry into the federation or what? 
  [Zubak] They have already refused to, you know. They have 
rejected the idea. We want to offer this to them every day, of 
course. It was a serious offer. If I may put it this way, it 
was a noble offer, after everything that has happened. They 
have rejected it. Those representing the Serb aggressors at the 
moment could be replaced by others. It is possible that we 
could make very rapid progress in our work with some other Serbs 
who want to live with us. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the </F>
Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, by an unidentified announcer; 
from the "Picture Versus Picture" program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Here in the Picture Versus Picture 
studio we have Dr. Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna. Good evening. Thank you for finding 
time after your long meeting in the Presidential Palace to come 
here to explain the circumstances under which this meeting took 
place and, of course, the whole story of the signing ceremony in 
Geneva tomorrow. First of all, at their meeting today Croatia's 
state and political leadership and 140 representatives of the 
Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina discussed the 
implementation of the Washington Agreement. What is your 
impression of the meeting? It went on for quite a long time. 
Does that mean that there were disagreements? 
  [Prlic] It was a frank meeting. First of all, various views 
were voiced. But, in my view, not for a moment did the meeting 
question the existing policy of the Croatian Democratic Union 
[HDZ] and its implementation, the policy embodied above all in 
the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna and, by implication, in the 
concern for all the Croats who continue to live beyond the 
borders of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna but remain the 
concern of the relevant bodies in the Croat republic of 
Herzeg-Bosna. 
  As I said, the talks were frank and ended in an atmosphere 
of 
support for the Washington Federation Agreement. Of course, 
there were various views on the maps as published yesterday, or 
rather the day before yesterday. This is understandable, one 
day after the event every new version, every new map provokes 
different reactions depending on the location. However, when 
all this was seen in the context of realizing the Croatian 
interest in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the interests of all Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in view of the opportunities the 
agreement will give to the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
conclusion was reached that, nevertheless, this agreement will 
help to realize the fundamental goals of the Croatian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Announcer] I can see that you have stubbornly and 
tendentiously been insisting on saying the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna. Does it exist and will it exist, and to what 
extent does what you call the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna 
correspond territorially to the maps agreed upon in Vienna? 
  [Prlic] I have not been tendentious in any way. One can, 
without being tendentious, speak about something, about what he 
wants to do.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] I mean, you deliberately placed 
stress on that. 
  [Prlic] In the areas under the control of the Croatian 
Defense Council [HVO] the people and all refugees from other 
areas are being born and die as citizens of the Croat republic 
of Herceg-Bosna. Birth and death certificates, the flag--in 
other words, the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is a reality, it 
is an instrument that has made it possible for us to attain the 
goal that we have just achieved. The Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna is a state mechanism that helps to secure the care, 
the logistics, wages for HVO units and fighters, tens of 
thousands of them, for the police of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, for all those employed in education, in primary 
and secondary schools, the University of Mostar, health workers, 
pensions. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] When you speak about the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, do you also include the two so-called mixed 
cantons? 
  [Prlic] The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna will continue to 
exist until the agreement on the federation between Bosniak 
Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina is implemented. We 
will not allow a vacuum in this process. Life must go on, daily 
needs must be met, and we are here to remain to the end. Later, 
this will be transformed into the authorities in individual 
counties and mixed cantons, and in the methods as agreed in the 
agreement on the Constitution. 
  [Announcer] When you said that the meeting in the 
Presidential Palace was frank, that differing views were put 
forward, I expect that among these differing views the most 
controversial one was the mixed, so called Mostar-Neretva 
Canton.... 
  [Prlic, interrupting] And the canton of Central Bosnia. 
  [Announcer] This came as a surprise to the people of 
Herceg-Bosna. 
  [Prlic] Well, in some way it did. But in view of the 
alternatives, I consider this solution a better one. It is a 
guarantee to both the Croat and the Bosniak Muslim people that 
they will be able to exercise parity within the two mixed 
cantons of Central Bosnia, and the area from Konjic to the point 
where Bosnia-Herzegovina has access to sea, i.e. Neum. I think 
that what is ahead of us are different forms of struggle. No, 
not a struggle, but of a normal life of fighting to realize 
one's national rights, language and all that stems from it, 
economic goals. More prominence will have to be given to 
willingness, common sense, ability, more than is the case in 
war. In other words, capability will have to be given more 
prominence. 
  [Announcer] Listening here in Zagreb to the voices coming 
from Herzegovina, it seems that the people there are most 
surprised by the fact that Medjugorje and Citluk [predominantly 
Croat towns in western Herzegovina] come under one of the mixed 
cantons. 
  [Prlic] So what? 
  [Announcer] Well, I do not know. The people seem to be 
worried about it. Are you saying they have no reason to be? 
  [Prlic] Well, the people are worried. The first reaction 
was, why is Citluk, which in addition to Grude is the most 
Croatian of all municipalities including Croatia, and former 
Yugoslavia, within the mixed canton. However, Citluk will 
remain Citluk, Medjugorje will remain Medjugorje, the Virgin 
Mary [vision of her reported in Medjugorje] and everything 
connected with her will remain there, and I cannot see why being 
in the mixed canton should threaten it in any way. 
  [Announcer] Let us now take a look at this other Croatian 
canton, the Bosnian Posavina Canton. It seems to me that the 
proposal for its size is rather generous--it is based on the 
census of 1990, but most of the territory of this canton is 
controlled by Serb units. In your opinion, what will happen to 
this corridor that seems to be of exceptional importance to the 
Serbs. Should it be severed in some way or not? 
  [Prlic] This is a matter of political consent. We heard from 
Geneva today about this agreement between the foreign ministers 
on the division of the total territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina--51 
percent for the Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation, that is 49 
percent for the Serbs, which I do not believe will be the final 
version. I think there are many other options involved in this 
game, and that we have still not found the definitive solution. 
What we now have in Bosnian Posavina was a lasting objective of 
ours....[pauses] Those who said: Look at all the refugees, we 
have lost something, when will this be returned....[pauses] I 
primarily value the opinions of those who invested something in 
this because war always has its own laws that differ 
considerably from those in peacetime. I believe that the Bosnian 
Posavina people have the right and opportunity to return to 
their homes, although this will be very difficult to accomplish 
through political dialogue. However, we should not disregard 
other options. 
  [Announcer] How do you view what the five powers have 
concluded in Geneva--they are in favor of the cease-fire 
agreement, they advocate the 51-49 percent solution, yet they 
also support a single Bosnia-Herzegovina in its internationally 
recognized borders. 
  [Prlic] What else could they have said? The world will not 
set a precedent so easily--it will not withdraw the 
international recognition of any state. Since the United States 
is backing this integrity, this option will be relevant. 
Whether it will be accepted as the final solution remains to be 
seen. 
  [Announcer] Let me ask you one more question: In view of the 
Washington Agreement and all other future options in 
negotiations with the Serbs--do you think the Croatian identity 
[Hrvatstvo-- Croathood] is threatened anywhere in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Prlic] The Croatian identity is threatened in many parts 
controlled by the Muslim and Serb Armies. There is quite an 
outflow of people. A Herceg-Bosna Chamber of Deputies 
delegation will be leaving on a visit to the Croats in Bosnian 
Krajina on Monday [16 May], this will be a three-day visit. We 
expect this to materialize, we hope that they will not only stay 
in Banja Luka, but that they will go to other places as 
well--there are 2,000 Croats in Teslic, they also live in 
Mrkonjic Grad, Sanski Most, and Prijedor. The Croats living in 
these areas are a matter of constant attention and concern for 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
  I wish to say that the implementation of the peace agreement 
and the federation agreement is going well, despite all the 
difficulties. We have managed to achieve freedom of movement, 
we signed relevant protocols with the Sarajevo government--for 
example, our tax and customs system has been accepted in its 
entirety. We have regulated the free flow of not only 
commercial goods, but also of humanitarian convoys, including 
those belonging to international humanitarian organizations. We 
have formed a mixed group for drawing up a program for the 
return of refugees. We are particularly interested in this 
because many more Croats have left the regions now controlled by 
the Muslim Army than is the case with Muslims who have left 
areas now controlled by the HVO. Therefore, the return of 
refugees is one of our vital interests. I wish to say this 
openly and clearly--this is of primary importance to Croatian 
policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The realization of the construction of the overall 
power-generating system in Bosnia-Herzegovina is already under 
way, this also applies to the water supply system and the 
railway line from the sea toward Sarajevo. These are only some 
of the measures taken so far. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Just a procedural question that does not seem to 
be unimportant: Will tomorrow's signature in Geneva be submitted 
for approval to your parliament's Chamber of Deputies? 
  [Prlic] The Chamber of Deputies session will be held before 
the constituent assembly--this was agreed this evening--and the 
constituent assembly is expected to ratify these acts because 
some of them have altered the federation's constitution adopted 
at the first session of the constituent assembly [sentence as 
heard]. 
  [Announcer] So you believe that this will be accepted by the 
Chamber of Deputies. 
  [Prlic] All or almost all members of the Chamber of 
Deputies, 
all members of the bodies of the HDZ for Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
the government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna were 
present today. Judging by what was apparent, all this was 
accepted. So I do not believe any problems could crop up in 
this regard.

  [Text] Jagodina, 15 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the 
Bosnian Serb parliament speaker, told Radio Jagodina today that 
the joint communique by foreign ministers of the United States, 
Britain, France, and the European three is a significant step 
forward in the resolving of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. The 
fact that everyone is for the end of hostilities and the return 
to negotiations is encouraging. As regards this we are not 
setting any conditions, for we believe that there is no 
alternative to peace, Krajisnik said. Expressing his optimism, 
Krajisnik said "peace will come soon." 
  Admittedly, we also have some have objections, primarily to 
the four-month cease-fire, for we think that a seasonal truce 
does not lead to an overall solution of the problem, Krajisnik 
said and added: But if this is a compromise needed to stop the 
Muslim hawks, who want to continue the war at any price, then we 
will agree to it. The main stumbling block in the future will 
be the unequal treatment of the republic of Srpska in the 
negotiations, Krajisnik said, and specified that he was 
referring to the lifting of the sanctions. 
  The contact group for Bosnia has not done what it should 
have 
done -- that is it has not made clear to all parties involved 
our position -- that we do not want to negotiate until the 
sanctions are lifted, Krajisnik said, stressing that the Serbs 
will firmly insist on this. The Geneva agreement definitely 
acknowledged two countries in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
which is better than having three, but we are confused by the 
territorial division of 51 [for Bosniaks, Croats] and 49 percent 
[for the Serbs], Krajisnik said. According to him these 
percentages were used when the option of three countries in the 
area was being discussed. 
  Any division is possible, but this kind of simplified one, 
which does not take into consideration the relation between the 
quantity and quality of the territory, is not acceptable to us, 
Krajisnik said and added: Perhaps this decision is some 
misunderstanding, or it is purposeful, but one must know that 
one percent of Sarajevo is worth five percent of some other part 
of the Bosnian territory. We do not rule out any combination 
and the Serbs will, to enable certain corrections, cede some 
territory to the other side, but much less than the Muslims 
think we will, he said and stressed: We will cede territory 
because we want to show the world that we are for peace and 
cooperation. We have shown this many times so far, but in 
return our willingness to make concessions was interpreted as a 
sign of weakness and offensives were then launched against us, 
Krajisnik said and added, current Muslim attacks on Ozren and 
provocations around Brcko are parts of the same scenario and if 
they do not stop the Serbs will have to respond in kind.

  [Text] The state delegation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, led by 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, has returned to Sarajevo after 
extensive work at the Vienna and Geneva talks. Haris Silajdzic 
said the following about their activities and the results 
achieved in Vienna where the Bosnian delegation held talks with 
a Croat delegation; and in Geneva, where a ministerial 
conference of the international Contact Group for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was held: 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] Regarding the implementation of 
the [Bosnian-Croat] agreement, I believe collective efforts have 
to be made; this cannot be done only through work of the 
government and a certain number of people. We all must 
participate to neutralize the consequences of the conflict. 
Most difficult will be returning people to their homes. I 
repeat, a collective effort is needed to execute that part of 
the job. 
  Regarding the [Geneva] communique I believe President 
Izetbegovic has analyzed its positive and negative sides in 
great detail. One could underline the problem of the 
continuation of the talks and the problem of guarantees. I 
think the international community has not committed itself 
regarding the continuation of the talks and the guarantees. It 
did set up some coordinates and a basic concept, but the 
obligations stemming from all this for the international 
community are not clear. The communique contains general 
clauses saying UN Security Council resolution should be 
respected. This is clear without the communique, but they are 
not being respected. 
  The main question is: How will this round of negotiations, 
which we are entering with best intentions and a desire to 
resolve the question peacefully, differ from the previous one? 
What are we talking about here? Agreements have been reached 
before, but there were no instruments to implement them [words 
indistinct] 
  We ask the question: If the aggressor does not join the 
talks 
-- they are now making it conditional on the lifting of the 
sanctions -- what will the international community do if they 
stick to this position? We cannot allow the status quo to 
continue -- which is what the aggressor wants to achieve -- on 
the territories conquered by force. The international community 
still does not have answers to this, nor adequate measures. And 
another question is: What happens if we reach an agreement, but 
the aggressor does not want to observe it? What happens then? 
There is no answer to this either. 
  The third question is the question of guarantees we had 
raised before, in particular at assembly sessions. What 
guarantees do we have that Bosnia-Herzegovina will not again 
become the victim of aggression, an invasion from Serbia and 
Montenegro? That Bosnia-Herzegovina will not again be a scene 
of new confrontations? We want international guarantees 
regarding this issue. There is no answer to any of this. We 
have their assurances, but no guarantees. The problem is in the 
credibility of the international community, the credibility 
whose roots have been to a large extent damaged. The question 
now arises: If the international community cannot resolve the 
question of respecting the Gorazde 3 km exclusion zone, how can 
it then resolve the global question of Bosnia-Herzegovina? We 
have not got an answer to this. We have been told the 
international community is working on it. Talks about this are 
under way, but no decision on this has yet been made. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, May 14 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb 
presidential spokesman Jovan Zametica said on Saturday [14 May] 
that the "Serb side accepts, unconditionally, the proposal for a 
general cessation of hostilities contained in the joint 
declaration" issued by seven states' foreign ministers in Geneva 
on Friday. "This, after all, has been or own proposal for a 
long time. But we are in favour of a permanent cessation of 
hostilities, not merely for four months," stressed Zametica in a 
statement faxed to TANJUG's Belgrade office from the cabinet of 
Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic. "The time limit on the 
cessation of hostilities envisaged in the joint declaration is 
harmful to the peace process," maintains Zametica. 
  The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, Great 
Britain, France and the European Union's "troika" (Belgium, 
Greece, Germany) on Friday invited Bosnia's warring Moslems, 
Serbs and Croats to agree to a four-month ceasefire, "with 
provision for extenscon," in which to negotiate a solution to 
their disputes. 
  The ministers, who coordinated a common strategy in the 
efforts to end the Bosnian conflict, invited the warring nations 
to make a serious effort, without prior conditions, for reaching 
a political settlement of the crisis. The ministers approved 
the European Union's formula which envisages for dividing 
war-shattered Bosnia-Herzegovina in a manner which would give 
the Moslems and Croats 51 percent of the original territory in 
which to form their federation, and the Serbs the remaining 49 
percent.

  [Text] In Maglaj a general alert was sounded at about 1200 
as the aggressor fired several artillery shells at the town. 
Fortunately, there were no civilian casualties. At the same 
time, Britsh UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] soldiers clashed 
with the Serbian aggressor. 
  [Reporter Hajrudin Ceric] First, the British were caught in 
fierce sniper fire from the criminals on the slopes of Mount 
Ozren. To protect their lives they returned fire from the 
small-caliber guns mounted on their combat vehicles. This was 
no convincing reason for the aggressor to cease fire. On the 
contrary, they opened up with brief but fierce bursts of fire 
from a Bofors gun. There was not the slightest trace of NATO 
aircraft in the sky as the blue helmets were stranded in dire 
straits. We have unofficially learned that there are no 
casualties among the ranks of the UNPROFOR unit.

  [Text] Bileca, May 15 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem Army continues 
on Sunday to violate the cease-fire in the area of the eastern 
town of Gorazde, opening fire on the adjacent Serb villages. 
Bosnian Serb Army sources inform that the Moslems on the left 
bank of the Drina [River] have shelled the villages on the right 
bank, where the Serb population has returned after their 
liberation in a Serb counter-offensive which checked a Moslem 
offensive launched from Gorazde earlier this Spring. 
  The Moslem infantry on Sunday attacked the village of Bijela 
in the Konjic municipality in northern Herzegovina, and engaged 
in sporadic provocations along the entire front between 
Nevesinje and Mostar, the local Bosnian Serb Army command 
informs. Moslems have also been opening fire from a 20-mm gun 
and a heavy machinegun on Serb positions in Sarajevo's suburb of 
Ilidza. 
  Three Moslem snipers have been firing from the city's 
Dobrinja locality at the Serb residential area near Sarajevo 
airport. Moslems have been opening fire also from small-arms and 
hand-held rocket launchers in the area of the Vrbanja bridge. 
  Movements of Moslem troops and mechanisation have been 
reported from the direction of Mt Igman towards the suburb of 
Hrasnica, and from Butmir airport to Donji Kotorac, all in 
Sarajevo.

  [Excerpt] Zvornik, Bratunac, 15 May (TANJUG) -- In their 
attacks on some areas in the republic of Srpska [in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina] Muslim units have once again used chemical 
weapons, representatives of the VRS [army of the republic of 
Srpska] said today. Serb defensive positions on Mount Majevica 
and in Mala, Velika Jelaca, and Lisaca have been attacked by 
Muslims using shells filled with chlorine-based chemicals. In 
their attacks on Serbs from the Tuzla area Muslim units used 
chemicals on several occasions, although international 
conventions prohibit the use of such weapons. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On the basis of the agreement on the 
demilitarization of the three-kilometer exclusion zone east of 
the River Drina, the command of the eastern Bosnian operational 
zone of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army in Gorazde has witdrawn its 
troops from the area of Mala Bisernica. Within the 24-hour 
deadline, members of our army withdrew while members of the army 
of the so-called republic of Srpska, who were supposed to 
withdraw all their forces, failed to do so. Positions in Mala 
Bisernica are under the control of UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] troops. Given that the aggressors failed to withdraw 
their (?police), the Bosnia-Herzegovina army returned to its 
positions.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 16 (AFP) -- Three pieces of heavy 
weaponry have been sighted by UN military observers in a 
Serb-controlled neighborhood in Sarajevo, UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) officials said here Monday. The location of the 
weapons -- two mortar guns and an anti-aircraft canon -- is in 
violation of the UN-imposed 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion 
zone around Sarajevo. UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said the 
two mortar guns were sighted Sunday in Grbavica, a neighborhood 
overlooking the capital. Another UN military source who 
requested anonymity said the anti-aircraft gun was also found in 
the same neighborhood which is under the control of Bosnian 
Serbs. The Serbs earlier this month managed to sneak a tank 
into the region. The tank, a T-34, disappeared while being 
transported on a truck from Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale in 
violation of the exclusion zone barring heavy weaponry around 
Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Report by Bernard Estrade] </F>
  [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 15 (AFP) -- The main 
hotel in the northern Bosnian town of Tuzla was hit late Sunday 
by a large-caliber artillery shell fired from Serb positions, 
but there were no casualties. The shell hit the Hotel Tuzla at 
10:15 p.m. (2015 GMT), heavily damaging a room on the building's 
fourth floor and part of the third floor. Two other shells 
landed near the hotel. An expert from the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR), inspecting the damage, told AFP the 122mm howitzer 
shell had been fired from Serb positions in the south-east. 
  The area around Tuzla, a mainly Moslem enclave in 
northeastern Bosnia, has been the scene of heavy fighting in 
recent days. The hotel, which is housing foreign journalists 
covering the fighting, lies right next to the headquarters of 
the Moslem-dominated Bosnian Government Army's Second Corps in 
charge of operations in the sector. The hotel was also occupied 
by visiting men's and women's basketball teams, in town to 
dispute the Bosnia Cup despite the fighting. 
  The army headquarters had been the scene Sunday afternoon of 
a special ceremony in which the corp's commander-in-chief, Hazim 
Cadic, distributed diplomas to local "patriotic personalities" 
to commemorate the May 15 start of hostilities in Tuzla two 
years ago. Firing began right after local television broadcast 
the ceremony, and one shell landed near the television offices. 
  Bosnian Serbs and Moslems have been accusing each other of 
preparing large-scale offensives with massive reinforcements in 
this strategic area. On Wednesday, shelling killed two people 
and seriously wounded four in the old sector of the town, not 
far from the hotel. The UN Protection Force spokesman for the 
northeast sector of the Bosnian conflict, Captain Jens Kirk, 
told AFP here earlier Sunday that 196 shells hit the nearby 
Vares sector, controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian 
Government Army, on Saturday and a further eight shells were 
fired on the town early Sunday. 
  Vares lies aboud 45 kilometres (27 miles) south of Tuzla and 
straddles a maze of routes linking northeast Bosnia to Sarajevo 
and the Dalmatian coast. A further 100 shells rained down 
Saturday on the "Sapna finger" east of Tuzla, and a UN armoured 
patrol of Nordic troops came under automatic arms fire on both 
Saturday and Sunday, Kirk said. Bosnian Government forces 
managed over the weekend to take control of Serb positions at 
Vijenac Hill, near Lukavac, southwest of Tuzla. 
  Bosnian Colonel Ekrem Advic, head of the press service of 
the 
Bosnian Army's Second Corps, told AFP "some of the shells 
hitting our villages and Tuzla had been fired" from those 
positions. The capture by the Bosnian Army of "some 10 square 
kilometres" (four square miles) of land in the sector was 
confirmed by sources close to UNPROFOR, who linked the Bosnian 
offensive and the shelling of Tuzla Wednesday.

  [Excerpts] The free territory of Zvornik has been under 
fierce attack by the aggressor, but our soldiers are scoring new 
successes. 
  [Reporter] After the aggressor's unsuccessful attempts to 
break through our defense lines in the Majevica part of the 
front, soldiers of the 206th Gallant Brigade, aided by soldiers 
from Teocak, have captured important hills of Domanica Kosa, 
Ikovi and Suha Cesma, and are in the immediate vicinity of the 
TV relay station. [passage omitted] 
  Brave soldiers of the 206th Gallant brigade successfully 
repulsed all attacks and inflicted high losses in human lives on 
the chetniks. The remaining chetniks withdrew in panic, leaving 
scores of their dead behind. Unable to shift the defense lines 
to their advantage, the chetniks vented their frustration by 
firing from all available weapons on the free territory, 
destroying whole buildings in Vitinica, (Cakula), Medjedja, 
(Kobilici), Kraljevici, (Nezuk), and Zaseok. Some 1,000 highly 
destructive shells fell on these locations, causing vast 
material damage. Some civilians were killed and wounded. 
Despite all this, our defense lines are firm and stable. This 
was a report from Zvornik by the information service of the 
206th Gallant Brigade.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, May 16 (AFP) -- Three pieces of heavy 
weaponry have been sighted by UN military observers in a Serb- 
controlled neighborhood overlooking Sarajevo, UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) officials said here Monday. The location of 
the weapons -- two mortar guns and an anti-aircraft canon -- is 
in violation of the UN-imposed 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion 
zone barring heavy weapons around the Bosnian capital. 
  UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said the two mortar guns were 
spotted Sunday in Grbavica. Another UN military source who 
requested anonymity said the anti-aircraft gun was also found in 
the same neighborhood. Annink said negotiations were underway 
to transport the weapons to a collection center. But the 
military source said that the Serbs were refusing to budge by 
claiming that the weapons had been neutralized. He said that 
claim was baseless as the Serbs had only removed the firing pins 
"which could be reinstalled in two minutes." The weekend 
discovery of the weapons was the latest in a series of 
violations of the exclusion zone and a ceasefire agreed in 
February by Bosnia's warring factions under the threat of NATO 
air strikes. [passage omitted] 
  UN peacekeepers have also increasingly come under fire, the 
latest such incident occuring Sunday when a convoy was targeted 
in the Mount Igman region, located about 15 kilometres (nine 
miles) from Sarajevo. Annink said that the mostly Moslem 
Bosnian Army was responsible for the attack but he did not 
elaborate. He added that UNPROFOR convoys were encountering 
increasing problems in southern Bosnia. He said about 50 
civilians, mainly women, have blocked part of the road linking 
the Croatian town of Split with the central Bosnian town of 
Zenica since this weekend. The women, he said, are demanding to 
know the wherabouts of their husbands who have gone missing and 
want the UN to pay them a fee for the convoys.

  [Text] Petrovac, May 14 (TANJUG) -- Fierce inter-Moslem 
fighting continued on Saturday for the sixth consecutive day in 
the Cazin Krajina, in the northwest of the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, local Moslem media reported. 
Reports on the situation on the front are, however, 
contradictory. According to Radio Velkaton based in Velika 
Kladusa, the center of the Moslem Autonomous Province of West 
Bosnia (APZB), APZB supporters have in the past 24 hours 
captured a very important height near Cazin and have inflicted 
huge casualties and losses in equipment on the forces loyal to 
the Moslem authorities in Sarajevo. APZB forces have suffered, 
as the radio said, minimum losses. 
  Radio Velkaton said that troops of the army loyal to the 
Bosnian Moslem hardline leader, Alija Izetbegovic, are still 
deserting in large numbers and joining the ranks of the 
supporters of his moderate rival, Fikret Abdic. According to 
Radio Cazin, a town under control of Izetbegovic's forces, the 
forces loyal to Izetbegovic have managed to recapture an 
important portion of the territories near Cazin in the past 24 
hours. 
  Inter-Moslem fighting has been underway in the Cazin Krajina 
since last October, when Abdic proclaimed the APZB opposing 
Izetbegovic's belligerent policy. He also immediatelly 
concluded peace agreements with Bosnian Serbs and Croats.

  [Text] All day long, the chetniks in Grabez, the Grmusa 
plateau, and in the Buzin section have been launching 
provocations and infantry attacks and firing from anti-aircraft 
weapons. This morning and evening they shelled the outlying 
districts of Cazin. Members of the traitor Kladusa paramilitary 
[Fikret Abdic's forces] have been attacking the outer rim of 
Cazin and Todorovo. Their artillery continued to pound civilian 
targets in the wake of their failed attempts at infantry forays 
along a large stretch of the demarcation line. There is again a 
large number of civilian casualties following these murderous 
attacks. There is also a great deal of material damage.

Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that aid in the amount of 100 
German marks will soon be given to all families of killed Muslim 
fighters [sehit] in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Liberal Party of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has issued the following statement: 
  We are very pleased with President Izetbegovic's statements 
and concrete activities concerning the welfare of families of 
killed fighters and (?killed Muslim fighters), as well as his 
statement that he will soon devote his endeavors to this problem 
alone. However, what has been left unclear is whether there was 
an error in the announcement or whether discrimination against 
killed fighters, patriots in the defense of the state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, is really being introduced, something that 
we cannot support. We expect the error, be it in the 
announcement or intentional, to be immediately corrected.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 15 (TANJUG) -- The Sarajevo daily 
LJILJAN, an organ of the Bosnian Moslem leadership, admits that 
the Moslem Army is receiving tonnes of weaponry despite the arms 
embargo, and describes large shipments that arrived in late 1992 
via a military airfield in Croatia. 
  "There will be arms, even if the blockade is such that not 
even a needle can slip through," says the daily in reaction to 
the latest debates on exempting Moslems from the arms embargo. 
  In September 1991, the United Nations imposed an embargo on 
arms exports and imports in the entire territory of former 
Yugoslavia, but the breakaway republics of Croatia, Slovenia and 
the Bosnian Moslem government in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, as 
well as certain Islamic and Western countries have repeatedly 
violated this resolution. 
  A shipment of 2,000 tonnes of weaponry, for which Moslems 
paid 27 million dollars abroad, reached Zagreb through the 
Adriatic Sea in mid-September 1992, says LJILJAN as carried by 
the Bosnian Serb News Agency SRNA. In the night between 
November 24 and 25 of 1992, Moslems from foreign countries 
launched a ship, The Dolphin, to take 6.7 million dollars' worth 
of arms to Bosnian Moslems from an unnamed port to Croatia. 
According to the LJILJAN report, The Dolphin was carrying four 
cannon with around 60,000 shells, 122mm mortar sets, 700,000 
12.7mm calibre bullets, 3,500 anti-tank shells, 82mm mortar sets 
with 1,500 shells and 10,000 122mm calibre rockets. 
  The cargo also included Toyota army jeeps with 
communications 
equipment used in the Desert Storm operation in the Gulf war and 
10,000 modern uniforms for the Bosnian Moslem Army. The Dolphin 
arrived at its destination port in late December, a month after 
it left dock, but it was intercepted by NATO military patrols in 
charge of implementing the U.N. resolution on the ban of arms 
shipments to former Yugoslavia. The ship was turned back and 
sent to Italy and the weapons and equipment were sold, LJILJAN 
says. 
  In parallel with the Dolphin operation, five Boeings left 
for 
one of Croatia's military airfields with a cargo of 90 tonnes of 
weaponry for the Bosnian Moslem government, including arrow 
missiles with launchers, 100 rpgs with around 8,000 shells. 
This cargo reached the Moslems in Bosnia, LJILJAN says. 
  The U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST said on Friday that an 
Iranian plane with at least 60 tonnes of explosives landed in 
Zagreb last week and that the shipment was part of the agreement 
between the Croatian authorities and the Bosnian Moslems to 
renew military operations against Serbs.

  [Text] After returning from Moscow, members of the 
delegation of the Serbian Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
held a news conference in Ljubljana today. Here is a report by 
Mahmut Lakicevic: 
  [Begin Lakicevic recording] The Serbian Civic Council of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina represents that force and initiative of the 
Serbian people that categorically opposes the criminal and 
aggressive policy of the Serbian Democratic Party and Karadzic's 
Army and strives for the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as 
indivisible, sovereign, and recognized within its 
natural-historical borders, as well as returning of the Serbian 
people to its constitutive role together with the other two 
ethnic groups in Bosnia-Herzegovina by strictly implementing 
international political solutions -- of course, those that do 
not recognize the aggressor's occupation and his (?methods) of 
solving the Bosnian crisis. 
  This was the gist of the statements Mirko Pejanovic and Miro 
Lazovic, members of the Serbian Civic Council, made at the news 
conference in Ljubljana after their official visit to Moscow. 
The (?continuation) of the peace process and the implementation 
of the Washington agreement provide an opportunity for that 
segment of the Serbian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina who do not 
recognize Radovan Karadzic's (?aggressor's) regime and the idea 
of a greater Serbia to join in the creation of the joint state 
of the three peoples in which human, civil, and national rights 
will be respected. 
  The aggressors' intention to create a greater Serbia through 
coercion has undoubtedly caused the greatest harm and destroyed 
many innocent lives above all among the Bosniak-Muslim people, 
but Karadzic's war expeditions have also morally and spiritually 
humiliated the Serb people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and set them 
back 100 years in history. 
  The Serbian Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina is trying to 
present the real truth about the suffering of the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which differs from the aggressor's 
propaganda and is rather successful in doing so. As Mirko 
Pejanovic, member of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, put 
it, the top Russian state leadership and church dignitaries with 
whom the delegation met in Moscow recently, were astounded by 
the fact that during the (?two-year) war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
aggressor's guns destroyed about 700 mosques, desecrated 
hundreds of Muslim and Croat tombs, and also ruined orthodox 
churches. They could learn this only from the Serbs who 
realistically saw into and [word indistinct] the entire outcome 
of the Serbian attack on Bosnia and who want to regain lost 
confidence and join the peaceful process of creating a united 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Lazovic pointed out that the Serbian Civic Council is more 
and more recognized as a partner in negotiations, and has 
already received invitations from many international 
organizations and European countries to talks about including 
into the Washington agreement those Serbs who consider 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to be their homeland. This interest exists 
in the guise of Bosnian Serbs in exile who are disappointed by 
Milosevic's policy and consider themselves to be second-class 
citizens, Pejanovic says, and they should be helped to return to 
their homeland. 
  The Washington agreement and the creation of the 
Bosniak-Croat Federation is the best opportunity for integrating 
the third people deceived by the illusion and sick dream of a 
greater Serbia whose builders and realizers should be brought 
before justice and the war crimes tribunal. 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina must retain its multinational and 
multicultural identity, as this is a condition of its historical 
and national survival which is based solely upon peace, respect 
for national rights, and the equality of its peoples, Mirko 
Pejanovic concluded at today's news conference. Members of the 
Serbian Civic Council were today received by Milan Kucan, 
president of the Republic of Slovenia. The talks held touched 
upon the role of the Bosnian Serbs in the Washington agreement 
and international cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Slovenia, as Miro Lazovic and Mirko Pejanovic are visiting that 
country in the role of state officials. The current issue of 
opening the embassy of the Republic of Slovenia in Sarajevo was 
touched upon in particular, as there is a large number of 
Slovenes who are still living on the territory controlled by the 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and who want to take part in the 
economic and cultural renewal of their second homeland. [end

  [Excerpt] In Geneva, Croatia has submitted a request to the 
United States to lend its support in speeding up the process of 
the reintegration of UN Protected Areas [UNPA's] into Croatia. 
During a meeting with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
Minister Granic asked the U.S. Government to lend its firm 
support in the case of Croatia's borders. The meeting took 
place in the UN embassy in Geneva before the formal ceremony 
held to mark the Croat-Muslim agreement. Ministers Granic and 
Christopher talked about the situation in the UNPA and about 
bilateral relations. After a cooperation agreement was reached 
they stressed a need for more specific agreements between 
Croatia and the United States in the future. 
  [Begin Granic recording] One of the important topics was 
U.S. 
support to the Republic of Croatia regarding an approach to the 
international financial institutions, more specifically, the 
credits of the World Bank [word indistinct] the European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Knin, Serb Krajina, May 14 (TANJUG) -- Serb Krajina 
official Mile Novakovic said on Saturday that [14 May] Serb 
Krajina authorities would demand that the U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) clearly state which of the sides to the 
Krajina-Croatia conflict had violated the ceasefire, and specify 
the time and place of the violations. There is no reason why 
UNPROFOR should not say this, said General Novakovic, who chairs 
the Serb Krajina central board for the implementation of the 
ceasefire agreed between the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) 
and Croatia. 
  R.S.K. military officials will submit a request to this 
effect to UNPROFOR Commander for Former Yugoslavia General 
Bertrand de Lapresle in Topusko on Sunday. General Novakovic 
stressed that the Serb side was willing to implement in full the 
ceasefire agreement negotiated by the two sides in Zagreb in 
March. This is our contribution to peace, in line with our 
lasting commitment to dealing with the conflict with Croatia 
only at the conference table, he stressed. 
  The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 by the local Serbs in 
those 
parts within the arbitrary Communist-era borders of Croatia were 
they are the majority population, in response to Croatia's 
violent secession from former Yugoslavia and trampling on their 
rights. The territory was placed under U.N. protection in the 
Spring of 1992. 
  General Novakovic indicated that the number of U.N. 
observers 
patrolling the line of separation between the belligerents was 
not adequate, and that UNPROFOR was still not using helicopters 
in the control and supervision of the ceasefire. These 
omissions on the part of UNPROFOR have resulted in inadequate 
control and hence inaccurate estimates of the implementation of 
the ceasefire agreement, said Novakovic. 
  Representatives of the European Union's observer team 
conferred with R.S.K. military authorities at the R.S.K. capital 
of Knin on Saturday about cooperation and the implementation of 
the ceasefire agreement. The leader of the team, General 
Mourmouris Panagiotis of Greece, told the press that the talks 
had been frank, substantive and useful. 
  R.S.K. Army Commander General Milan Celeketic said that 
common ground had been found on questions of mutual interest.

<F P=106> [From the "World Clock" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] There are several examples in 
the history of the post-communist countries of national parties 
and movements breaking up. Something similar is now taking 
place in Zagreb, where a new political formation has split off 
from the party of President Tudjman. Gyorgyi Orban has spoken 
to its leader, Stipe Mesic, who was, incidentally, the last head 
of state of the former Yugoslavia. 
  [Begin recording] [Orban] Why did the founders of the ruling 
Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] leave the party? What were 
you dissatisfied with? 
  [Mesic speaking in Croatian, with superimposed translation] 
The HDZ has fulfilled its historical task. We, the founders of 
the party, together with the HDZ, led the country out of 
communism and laid the foundations of the democratic system. 
But the present-day structure of the HDZ is no longer suited to 
today's challenges, which need answers to the problems of 
creating the new Croatian state. 
  First, the party is becoming more and more bureaucratic in 
its organization and structure, and the party is directed from a 
center, to be more precise, from the office of the president of 
the republic. 
  Second, Croatia's policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina is two-faced. 
For public opinion they pretend to favor a united 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereas in fact those forces within the 
party which support a splinter state, the so-called 
Herzeg-Bosna, are becoming stronger. Gojko Susak, who is the 
defense minister and the party's deputy chairman, is in daily 
telephone contact with those in Herzeg-Bosna who sparked off the 
Croatian-Muslim battles. What all this means in practice is 
that we are playing an active part in doing ourselves harm. For 
if the breakup of Bosnia-Herzegovina does come about, then the 
probability of Croatia's territorial integrity ever being 
attained will diminish. 
  We are also critical of the way the president of the 
republic 
directs the bodies of authority. From his office he tries 
simultaneously to influence the work of parliament, the 
government, the courts, and other important institutions. 
  [Orban] What are the chances of maintaining the balance in 
parliament in the wake of your departure from the government 
party? Can we expect an opposition majority? 
  [Mesic] There is a hard campaign going on against us, of the 
kind that has not been experienced since the darkest period of 
Bolshevism. Those who want to go over to the Independent 
Democrats are exposed to great pressure. One by one they are 
being forced, virtually daily, to withdraw or even not to leave 
the government party. It is not only civil servants surrounding 
the president of the republic, but also the president himself, 
who try to talk these deputies out of joining us. 
  As for what kind of power balance emerges in parliament, 
that 
is difficult to predict. Anything could happen. But it is 
impossible to alter the facts which led to the departure of the 
Independent Democrats. It is my conviction that opinions can 
only be influenced for a short time with methods such as these. 
  [Orban] You are the chairman of the [Croatian] Assembly, 
that 
is to say parliament. Josip Manolic, who likewise left the 
ruling party, is chairman of the upper house. What will happen 
now with your functions? Can you keep them, and could this 
crisis lead to the calling of early parliamentary elections? 
  [Mesic] Your question goes to the heart of the problem. The 
head of state is constantly alluding to democracy, but I feel 
that he does not understand its essence [words indistinct]. 
Because to take steps, with telephone calls, to ensure the 
dismissal of the speaker of the upper house cannot really be 
described as a democratic method. The question is not whether 
the speakers of the lower and upper houses of parliament remain 
in their posts, but what kind of power relations will develop in 
parliament. Parliamentary statuses cannot be changed from the 
presidential office. One has to sit around the table and state 
that the power relations have changed since the last 
parliamentary elections and that the functions have to be 
redistributed. 
  It is not only the Independent Democrats that have been set 
up since the elections of two years ago; other parliamentary 
parties, such as the Peasant Party, or the Istrian Democratic 
Alliance, have also split into several factions. So, it is not 
a question of dismissals but of a redistribution of roles. 
  [Orban] What kind of future are the Independent Democrats 
offering to the Croatians? What would you do differently? For 
example, what kind of policy would the new party conduct 
vis-a-vis Bosnia-Herzegovina or the Croatian Serbs? 
  [Mesic] I believe that a division of Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
unthinkable, because then it would be impossible ever again to 
restore the territorial integrity of Croatia. The Croatian 
Independent Democratic Party wishes to conduct open politics in 
the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its view is that the Bosnian 
Serbs must at all events be involved in the talks aimed at 
reaching a settlement. We want a Croatia that is a democratic 
civic state, which protects all its citizens, respects human 
rights, and guarantees the rights of the nationalities living on 
its territory. Croatia wishes to cooperate with its neighbors; 
it will not erect a Berlin wall along its borders. So, we would 
like to create a Croatia which fully accords with democratic 
norms. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech on 
12 May on page 36, under the headline "Hopes of This Summer in 
Croatia," carries a 1,500-word interview with Croatian Prime 
Minister Nikica Valentic by Jirina Shrbena. The date of the 
interview, which took place in the Croatian resort town of 
Makarska, is not given. The topics discussed are solely of an 
economic character. 
  In the introduction, the author observes that prior to his 
appointment, Valentic was director general of the INA 
petrochemical plant, and that, over the 14 months in office, he 
managed to stabilize the economy of Croatia and launch its 
fundamental transformation. Privatization has started and, 
albeit with some problems, the banks are being financially 
consolidated. 
  "For seven months now, Croatia has recorded zero growth in 
consumer prices and, according to the prime minister, the annual 
rate of inflation will not exceed 10 percent. Foreign currency 
reserves increased from zero to $1.6 billion, and are expected 
to reach $2 billion before the year is over. The prime minister 
does not consider the country's foreign debt amounting to $2.8 
billion to be a significant problem, especially if tourism can 
be brought up to its former level. Valentic regards this year's 
season to be a test of the Croation economy." While "this 
year's tourism revenues are expected to exceed 2 billion German 
marks [DM], they should reach the prewar level -- i.e., DM6 
billion -- within a few years." Asked about the protection of 
foreign investment, Valentic said that "the government provides 
all the guarantees including the transfer of earnings abroad." 
He emphasized the internal convertibility that will also apply 
to the new monetary unit, the kuna, which will replace the dinar 
on 30 May. Replying to a question regarding the restrictions 
choking down business activities, Valentic said: "In order to 
reduce the inflation of 50 percent per month to 10 percent per 
year, we had to adopt radical measures. Rather than artificial, 
these measures are based exclusively on the economic basis. It 
is a combination of anti-inlationary steps in the monetary, 
fiscal, and wage spheres." Valentic also emphasized that a tax 
reform was launched -- the tax legislation is harmonized with 
the European standard, and the rates will be gradually reduced. 
Furthermore, according to him, "the orientation of the Croatian 
economic policy is clear and, I believe, correct, and we do not 
intend to change it." 
  The fact that "so far, the country managed to bear the 
burden 
of the conflict without any financial assistance from abroad," 
is explained by the prime minister by "the existence of small 
farms working 3 million hectares of land and producing double 
the amount of food Croatia consumes." Additional help is 
provided by Croatia's own oil and gas covering 20 percent of the 
total consumption, and the source of foreign currency in the 
form of 3 million Croats living abroad, who are responsible for 
an inflow of DM3 billion per year. Of course, the demand for 
capital is much higher and, according to Valentic, "Croatia has 
a moral right to foreign assistance." The first foreign credit 
in the amount of $138 million should be obtained from the World 
Bank in June, and additional credits of between $400 and $500 
million from the IMF should follow before the end of the year. 
Refugees are a great financial burden, but a large part of the 
original 600,000 people already returned to their homes. The 
prime minister considers the return of the territory occupied by 
Serbs a necessary condition for solving this problem and 
normalization of the situation. "The principle of inviolability 
of the border must be the golden principle," he said.

  [Text] Ljubljana, May 13 (TANJUG) -- Croatia's Adriatic oil 
company has impounded 15,000 tons of oil the Slovenian firm 
Petrol of Ljubljana has bought in Russia until the Slovenian oil 
refinery in Lendava settles its outstanding debt of 1.4 million 
Deutsche marks with the Adriatic oil. Croatia has also 
suspended all light oil deliveries to Slovenia's only refinery 
in Lendava until it has paid back the 8.5 million dollars it 
owes to Naftaplin in Zagreb for light oil deliveries made so 
far. The Slovenia-Croatia silent oil war threatens to seriously 
undermine the already tense relations between the two 
neighbouring countries which seceded from the former Yugoslav 
federation in 1991. Relations between the two sides are 
especially burdened by the unresolved border and property 
issues, over 600 million dollars in unsettled claims of private 
depositors with the Ljubljanska Banka and deterioration in 
economic relations.

<F P=106> [Article by Roman Majetic: "Three Hundred Tonnes of Oil per </F>
Day Goes to Serbia From Occupied Djeletovci"] 
  [Text] "Having collected the information from the Croatian 
authorities and the Ina oil company, and after a talk with the 
representatives of the Serb authorities in occupied Croatian 
territory, I went to the oil fields in Djeletovci to check the 
allegations on the spot. Following the investigation, I am 
submitting my report to the UN Secretary General. The report 
contains conclusive evidence that the Serbs in Sector East, an 
occupied part of Croatian territory, have been pumping oil from 
the wells at Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca, and shipping it to 
the oil refinery in Pancevo near Belgrade, in direct violation 
of the UN Security Council Resolution 757...." it says in the 
introductory part of the report submitted in late October 1992 
to UN Secretary General by John P. Thomas, a US expert engaged 
by the United Nations to check the possibility that the embargo 
is being violated on the territories under the protection of the 
peace forces. 
<H5>  Questions With No Answers </H5>
  John P. Thomas undertook his investigation following the 
frequent complaints of the Croatian Government that, in the 
occupied territories in eastern Slavonia, oil is being pumped 
daily from the sources in Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca. 
Although the Croatian authorities, including the Osijek police, 
the government, and parliament, had protested many times, and 
asked UNPROFOR to prevent the possible depletion of the oil 
fields, there was no specific response, only unspecified 
promises. Colonel Alexander Hromchenko, who, during 1992, was 
commander of Sector East, promised in early August that he would 
carry out an investigation in Djeletovci and inform the public 
of the results within a week. However, nothing ever arrived. 
  Although the Croatian Government asked UNPROFOR many times, 
the UN never confirmed whether the Serbs were pumping oil in 
Djeletovci. Moreover, although John P. Thomas submitted his 
report as early as in October 1992, stating that the Serbs were 
pumping oil in the occupied parts of Croatian territory, and 
shipping it to Serbia (thus violating the UN Security Council 
Resolution 757 on the economic embargo against Serbia), the 
Croatian Government has still not been given the information 
contained in the report, which GLOBUS is now publishing. 
  The oil wells in Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca were 
occupied by the Serbs in the fall of 1991, at the same time a 
great part of eastern Slavonia was occupied. The largest of the 
three wells is the one in Djeletovci, which had produced 17 
percent of oil in Croatia before the war. Although the Serbs 
seized the area as early as in November 1991, the pumping 
started only in August 1992. There were several reasons for it, 
one of the most important being that the Serbs in that part of 
the occupied territory did not manage to establish a regular 
water and electricity supply for several months. Moreover, 
Djeletovci are near the occupied village of Nijemci, on the 
frontline. One of the reservoirs at Opatovac was seriously 
damaged during shelling. This is a reservoir for crude oil from 
Djeletovci before it is shipped to the refinery. 
  In spite of all the difficulties, the Serbs made great 
efforts to put the oil-pumping plant in working order, 
especially after the UN Security Council introduced the economic 
embargo against Serbia. 
<H5>  Croatian Army Reconnaissance Patrol Reports </H5>
  Croatian Army reconnaissance patrols have sent many reports 
on activities around the oil wells. They regularly reported on 
trucks bringing in equipment, workers installing pumps on 
wells.... On the basis of these reports, the Croatian 
Government regularly submitted complaints. However, it was not 
only the Croatian authorities that asked UNPROFOR to check the 
information about the Serbs pumping oil from Croatian oil-wells 
in eastern Slavonia. The UNPROFOR headquarters received reports 
from its own members on the ground. For instance, L.W. Moore, 
UNPROFOR civilian police commander in Sector East, said, in one 
of the many reports, in August 1992: 
  "This investigation was the result of continuing allegations 
from the Croatian side that oil fields in the Djeletovci area 
which belong to Croatia were being depleted by those in 
authority in the UNPA at this time. In support of that 
allegation the Croatians advise that the technology used in the 
field is so advanced that pumps are not needed at the field and 
that oil could be shipped out underground. This matter was 
discussed with Osijek police on 4 August 1992 and they advise 
that there are pipelines from the field to Opatovac on the 
Danube and to Croatia. It is therefore believed that the field 
is operating and oil is being pumped to the storage facility in 
Opatovac and then moved by tanker or barge to Pancevo near 
Belgrade. 
  In support of the belief of the Croatians, two incidents 
were 
reported to this HQ by our station in Oriolik. First, on 23 
July 1992 our members encountered members of the local police in 
the area with a trailer full of pumps. On 30 July 1992 they 
responded to a fire at the main office/complex, and learned that 
a large oil tank being repaired had accidently caught on fire. 
Later they were told that the fire was intentional in an effort 
to burn off remaining oil in the tank so that it could be 
repaired. 
  These two incidents clearly indicate that if they are not 
actually pumping oil, they intend to. As a result a visit was 
made to the pumping complex on 6 August 1992. It was an 
informal meeting where coffee was served. In the course of the 
conversation the following was learned. First it was rather 
evident that at this time no oil is being pumped. The complex 
is at present without electricity to move oil either out of the 
ground or to pump it to other locations. A fairly small staff 
is currently employed at the site during the day only. Their 
goal is to get the systems back in place to allow the pumping of 
oil, and once that is ready, there will be round-the-clock 
operation at the site." 
  Having described the difficulties the Serbs were facing, 
L.W. Moore concluded at the end of his report: "...at present 
the oil is not being pumped, but every efforts is being made to 
utilize the facility to supply crude oil." 
<H5>  Civilian Police Reports </H5>
  Although UNPROFOR had been ignoring all the Croatian demands 
to investigate if the Serbs were pumping oil at Djeletovci, the 
reports made by their civilian police prompted the UN to 
consider the instances of obvious violations of the embargo 
after all. Thus, on the basis of the Special Service Agreement, 
UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali engaged John P. Thomas, a US 
expert in oil exploitation, to determine whether oil was in fact 
being pumped in eastern Slavonia. 
  Thomas started working on this in early September 1992. He 
spent his first week in Zagreb, where he met with Cedric 
Thornberry, who showed him several UNPROFOR civilian police 
reports, which supported the thesis that the Serbs were 
preparing to exploit the oil wells. Thomas claims that 
Thornberry expressed his doubts about the accuracy of the 
reports. 
  Apart from talking to Thornberry and his associates, the US 
expert also visited Ina: "I met several very friendly people, 
who helped me get the real picture by supplying me with a great 
deal of information about the oil wells in eastern Slavonia. I 
talked to Mr. B. Jazbec, an engineer with 30 years of experience 
in Ina. I also talked to Dr. M. Zelic, production manager in 
Ina Naftaplin." After seven days in Zagreb, during which time he 
collected information about the oil wells, Thomas decided to 
investigate the situation on the ground. "I left for the UNPA 
on 14 September. I went to Erdut and stayed at the Sloboda 
Hotel, which does not take credit cards. 
  "Although I had arranged to visit the site the next day, 
September 15, the trip was postponed, allegedly because the 
local military commanders were too busy. Two days later, during 
the first visit, I was denied close access to the oil wells, 
allegedly because the entire site had been mined. However, I 
obtained the appropriate permits and visited Djeletovci, but was 
still denied access to the other two oil-wells. 
  "Although, during the one day visit to the oil-wells at 
Djeletovci, I did not see oil being pumped, the picture of the 
overall situation at the pumping site and all the evidence I 
have seen and collected undeniably indicate that the Serbs are 
pumping oil from the Croatian wells in Sector East. There is no 
doubt that the Serbs are pumping oil from the wells at 
Djeletovci, and it is almost certain that they are doing so with 
the other two wells (Ilaca and Privlaka). It is necessary to 
point out that the quantities of oil pumped daily at Djeletovci 
are not small. Therefore, the Serbs are not only violating the 
UN Security Resolution 757, but they are also causing the 
Republic of Croatia considerable material damage." 
  To support the conclusion of his report, Thomas supplied 
several pieces of conclusive evidence: "During one of the 
visits I came across a large number of already installed oil 
pumps: see-saw pumps (horse-head shaped), hydraulic pumps, gas 
pumps.... Some pumps were used for pumping the oil from the 
wells, while others were used for loading the oil into cisterns. 
Although none of the pumps were working while I was visiting 
the wells, it was obvious that they were being regularly used. 
There were traces of fresh crude oil near the well, and a lot 
of staff around.... 
<H5>  Oil for Pancevo </H5>
  "All the former sources confirmed that the Serbs were facing 
two great problems that prevented them from starting to exploit 
the oil wells. The first problem was lack of electricity, 
without which it was impossible to start some of the pumps. 
Another problem was the poor supply of water, which is crucial 
for pumping. Namely, the oil in Djeletovci is pumped in a very 
simple way: oil reserves, which are below the ground, emerge on 
the surface thanks to natural pressure. However, the pressure 
gradually becomes weaker, which can cause the oil to stop 
flowing. In order to prevent that, water is poured into the 
well, which replaces the outflowing oil, and the pressure is 
thus maintained. By seeing the situation at the wells in 
Djeletovci, I ascertained that the Serbs had solved both 
problems and thus started pumping oil from the wells on a 
regular basis." 
  In his report, Thomas also stated accurate estimates on the 
quantities of oil that the Serbs were pumping every day: 
"Before the war, Croatia pumped about 700 tonnes of crude oil 
from the wells at Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca (255,000 
tonnes of oil per year), which was a great part of the total 
Croatian oil production. 
  "With all the difficulties the Serbs faced concerning the 
pumping of oil (occasional power failures, lack of expert staff, 
being close to the Croatian Army positions), my estimate is that 
at least 350 tonnes of oil is pumped at Djeletovci per day, 
which is half the prewar production of oil at these wells, which 
used to make up to 17 percent of overall oil production in 
Croatia. 
  "Moreover, there are two incidents, mentioned also in the 
UNPROFOR civilian police reports, that also confirm that the 
wells are being exploited. One of the large reservoirs caught 
fire when the Serbs tried to repair it without having completely 
emptied it. Another incident mentioned by the UNPROFOR civilian 
police is an explosion in the village of Mirkovci near Vinkovci, 
in which two people were said to have been killed. The 
explosion occured when the Serbs were connecting an extension to 
the well in Djeletovci to the pipeline that leads to the 
refinery in Pancevo and goes through Mirkovci. They thus 
facilitated the underground oil transport straight to the 
refinery, and moved the cisterns from the roads, which, until 
then, transported the oil before the eyes of UNPROFOR along the 
15-mile route from Djeletovci to the storage facility in 
Opatovac. From there the oil was transported by barge to a 
refinery in Pancevo, which the civilian police reports also 
mentioned. Traces of oil near the village of Negoslavci and on 
the Djeletovci- Opatovac road (near the village of Sidski 
Banovci) corroborate the above mentioned." 
  Thomas submitted his report to the United Nations in 
October 1992, only a month after the exploitation of the wells 
had started. At the time, the Serbs were pumping 350 tonnes 
from Djeletovci a day, which is half of the well's maximum 
capacity. Now, almost two years later, the Serbs continue to 
exploit the wells in eastern Slavonia, in which the peace forces 
in Sector East are not obstructing them at all. 
  Moreover, to this day UNPROFOR has not answered the Croatian 
Government on whether the Serbs were pumping oil at Djeletovci. 
Since the Serbs in the meantime have managed to solve all the 
problems concerning the water and electricity supply, it is 
estimated that the quantity of oil being pumped at Djeletovci 
daily is much greater than the initial 350 tonnes. According to 
some estimates of the Ina experts, as much as 900 tonnes of oil 
per day are currently being pumped, which is 200 tonnes more 
than the anticipated maximum. This exploitation of wells, which 
exceeds the needs of the Serbs in the occupied parts of Croatia, 
is not only causing great material damage to the Croatian 
economy, but, as the experts have stated, it could permanently 
destroy the oil wells in eastern Slavonia.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Admiral Davorin Kajic: "We Are Not Afraid of </F>
Serbian Gun-Boats!"] 
  [Text] That a Serbian missile gun-boat detained the tanker 
Lido in the Adriatic is an indication that serious incidents 
have started occurring at sea as well as on land. This was the 
first time that a Serbian warship so decidedly faced the 
blockade action of the international peace forces. There have 
been many instances of ships being detained or taken away, but 
there has never been an action of such marked confrontation. 
After a crew of allied commandos disembarked on the Lido, the 
Serbian gun-boat appeared -- all this was happening some 40 
miles away from the shore, which means deep in the blockade 
zone. The gun-boat did not make any provocation, but it tried 
to interfere with taking the tanker to Brindisi by its very 
presence. 
  The incident itself may seem a crazy, thoughtless act, 
inappropriate soldiers' behavior, but I believe it is not so. I 
believe that, too, was part of the general idea of military 
pressure and intentional provocation of tense actions, with 
fierce confrontation as their aim, in which firmness and 
military persistence in the defense of their aims would be 
displayed. All this has been seen many times before, lately 
especially around Gorazde, in the constant bombing of Croatian 
territory from Bosnia, in the accumulation of troops around 
Brcko, in the inflexibility at the demarcation lines. In the 
so-called UNPA's there regularly appears an odd gun or a tank, 
and armed group raids and other attempts to keep the occupied 
territory continue. Many incidents involving UNPROFOR also show 
that this policy has intensified. 
<H5>  An Increasing Number of Incidents </H5>
  Now it has started happening at sea, too. The purpose of 
such provocations is not to scare the allied frigate or seize a 
tanker, but to show that Serbia is prepared to defend the 
positions it has occupied, including those at sea, despite the 
powerful allied fleet, and to oppose the blockade. This could 
also be a form of additional pressure on the allies to stir up 
disorder, and perhaps even disunity among them. 
  Although we do not have the information that would account 
for the entire action, we can assume, judging by the logic and 
what followed, that other Serbian forces were also on the alert. 
For instance, we know that they have a certain number of 
warships, including submarines, in operational use. There was 
probably another boat ready to sail out, or else there was a 
submarine somewhere nearby, its task being to support the 
gun-boat. 
  I believe that one of these submarines is constantly on 
patrol a certain distance away from their coast. Naturally, the 
blockade forces are doing everything necessary in anti-submarine 
protection. However, despite this protection, submarines are 
dangerous, and their aim is not only to cause unrest. We must 
reckon on the fact that the air forces could have appeared above 
the site of the incident in only a few minutes. A factor that 
could have added to the complexity of the situation could have 
been coast missile divisions. The incident occurred outside the 
range of tactical systems, but we know that Serbia has received 
extended range anti-ship missiles. At a certain time Italy was 
threatened by land-to-land missiles, with the range of about 
1,000 km. These are unconvincing things, but they do function 
psychologically, within the strategy of provoking incidents. On 
the basis of the aforementioned, we can see that the operation 
was quite complex, although it seems simple and short-term. 
Frustration, anger, or some other emotional outburst of a 
commander of the Serbian fleet or some other individual in the 
military hierarchy should therefore be ruled out. Although 
individuals or navy commanders can incite such actions, this 
incident should also be viewed in the context of events in the 
air and on land. 
<H5>  Tension Stretched to Extremes </H5>
  The same things are happening there -- the tension between 
the Serb army and the "blue helmets" is intentionally stretched 
to extremes, to playing on the edge of the sword. It is a very 
risky game, but Serbia has decided that it has turned out to be 
profitable so far, as so far Serbia has been left unpunished. 
The Serbs have damaged several planes, downed one, killed 
several members of the peace forces; they arrest them, hold them 
hostages -- about a hundred at a time -- and they are not 
punished for it. They are, therefore, making use of the basic 
principles of the United Nations actions: no revenge, but 
prevention of great destruction, inhumane actions, and so on. 
This is deliberate misuse of the UN policies, which are very 
considerate, peaceful, and humanitarian, and highly restrained 
in resorting to force. 
  The long-announced political resolution is probably being 
prepared. The great powers have completed the final 
preparations for the final negotiations, but Serbia, with such 
incidents, shows a decisiveness not to withdraw from the 
occupied positions, that is, not to return the occupied 
territory. This incident shows that Serbia wants to achieve 
more at sea, too. The sanctions and the naval blockade have 
badly damaged Serbia, so it is looking for ways out at sea, too. 
This blockade also has to be broken, the allied fleet made to 
go as far away from the shore as possible. It wants to show the 
allied forces that this blockade does not mean much either, 
although this is not true, but certain negotiating positions are 
thus displayed. While positions are being taken, we should not 
be surprised if there is another such incident at sea. 
  The threats will probably recur. This can have negative 
consequences for Croatia, too. The issue of lack of safety of 
both cargo and tourist traffic in the Adriatic can be raised 
again. More such incidents would bring about, for instance, the 
raising of the insurance charges for ships and cargoes, and our 
waters would be proclaimed an unsafe zone, which means that 
there would be a decrease in profit from tourism and traffic. 
There have been no open attacks in our seas, but there is a 
constant danger of naval terrorist actions. The fact that there 
have not been any does not mean that we are not prepared to 
protect our sea. On the contrary!

  [Text] Zagreb, 13 May (TANJUG) -- Milan Djukic, chairman of 
the Serb National Party [SNP] in Zagreb, warned in a special 
statement for the public today that the position of the Serbs in 
Croatia "is no longer acceptable and can no longer be 
tolerated." He asked why the Serbs who remained in Croatia have 
become "second class citizens" and why they only have 
obligations and not rights stemming from the constitution. 
Djukic addressed a series of questions on Croatia's policies to 
Croatian authorities, demanding to know "whether Croatia wishes 
the Serbs to remain in Croatia at all," because the Croatian 
authorities are completely oblivious to "the manner in which the 
Serbs are leaving Croatia." 
  Djukic asked: Does Croatia want to reduce the Serbs to 8 or 
5 
percent of the total population of the country? He added that 
President Franjo Tudjman was persistently trying to explain 
certain facts to the public that are "counterproductive at a 
time when a solution to the political crisis is being sought." 
He cited as an example the introduction of the kuna as the new 
currency; the genesis of this, he said, is well known to the 
Serbian people [the kuna was the legal currency in the 
Nazi-backed Independent State of Croatia during World War II]. 
  Commenting on Tudjman's statement that communism had been 
more damaging to Croatia than fascism, Djukic assessed that this 
could only be acceptable to like-minded people but not to the 
Serbs in Croatia who are not ashamed of their contribution to 
the war against fascism and its domestic collaborators. 
  These questions are being posed at a time when, on the one 
hand, the Croatian people are firmly determined to build a 
sovereign and national state, while on the other, the Serb 
people in Croatia "are having to put up with an imposed 
political status against their will." 
  The Serbs that have remained in Croatia did not vote for a 
state belonging solely to the Croats, but for a Croatia 
belonging to all its citizens. They are not in favor of an 
obscure model of democracy -- such as the national model -- but 
of a bourgeois democracy, Djukic said. 
  We are in favor of Croatia's integrity, "But not at all 
costs 
-- not at the cost of war," the leader of the SNP said.

CSO 

<F P=106>   [Editorial Report] The following items on economic </F>
developments in Croatia are drawn from recent issues of 
periodicals published in the republic. 
<H5>  Geofizika Employees Protest Firm's Privatization </H5>
  The Zagreb weekly GLOBUS reported in its 22 April issue that 
a few weeks earlier the director of the Geofizika enterprise in 
Zagreb received in his office a stranger who greeted him with: 
"Good morning, I am Mijo Meter, the new owner of your 
enterprise." Meter then presented a photocopy of a sales 
contract dated 29 March 1994 stating that he and two partners 
from the United States had purchased all of Geofizika's stock 
from the Croatian Privatization Fund. According to GLOBUS, Ivan 
Penic, president of the fund, sold Geofizika without the consent 
of the fund's management board. The weekly noted that it had not 
heard of any other case of a firm being sold without a decision 
by the management board. The contract, reproduced in GLOBUS, 
states that Meter and his partners paid 2,020,000 German marks 
[DM] for stock with a "nominal value" of DM845,656.08. 
  The arrival of the "new owner" caused "consternation" at 
Geofizika, GLOBUS reported. When Meter requested that all the 
company's files be turned over to him, the director replied that 
the photocopied sales contract was not adequate proof that Meter 
was indeed the new owner of Geofizika and that no one had 
officially informed the enterprise that it had been sold. 
  GLOBUS expressed surprise that the Croatian Privatization 
Fund sold Geofizika for only DM2 million, when, according to the 
paper, it is worth DM40 million--with "its office building and 
facilities alone" worth at least DM25 million. Furthermore, 
GLOBUS noted, Geofizika is of "strategic" worth to Croatia 
because it possesses valuable "top secret" documents on 
exploratory oil drilling throughout former Yugoslavia and in 
"many countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Central and South 
America." GLOBUS reported that Geofizika used to conduct 
geological and hydrological prospecting for INA Naftaplin, the 
Zagreb-based petroleum and natural gas producer and processor, 
and that in "late 1991 and early 1992" the two enterprises had 
discussed merging. Commissions had been set up and negotiations 
started, "but INA-Naftaplin became a state enterprise and 
Geofizika a public enterprise subject to the law on 
transformation of ownership and privatization," and thus the 
"district court in Zagreb could no longer register this merger." 
  Geofizika personnel were not informed of the court's 
decision 
until six days after the expiration of the deadline for the 
"self-transformation of ownership," i.e., the period in which 
company employees could buy the company, GLOBUS said, and, in 
accordance with the law, responsibility for Geofizika's 
privatization had been transferred to the Privatization Fund. 
The Geofizika workers council made a decision on 6 June 1992 to 
try to salvage the workers' legal right to precedence in 
purchasing shares of Geofizika stock, but the Croatian 
Privatization Fund "obviously did not accept this proposal." 
  GLOBUS reported that Geofizika filed a complaint at the 
Zagreb Commercial Court on 11 April asking that its sale to 
Meter and his partners be declared null and void. GLOBUS also 
said that the firm's employees had requested the Croatian 
petroleum workers trade union, the president of the republic, 
and numerous other government and business officials to provide 
"aid and protection." 
<H5>  Unpaid Bills Result in Power Cut-Offs in Zadar </H5>
  A large number of Zadar enterprises were without electricity 
on Monday, 18 April. The following day's issue of the Split 
daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported that the general director of 
the Croatian Electric Industry [HEP] had ordered the cut-off of 
power to numerous enterprises with overdue electric bills. Zadar 
enterprises and households owe HEP DM11.5 million, an average of 
three months' worth of electricity consumption per user. Zadar 
residents tried to prevent the cut-off of power by appealing to 
the county government and chamber of commerce, arguing that the 
state owed Zadar businesses several times the amount of the 
overdue electric bills for their aid to the Croatian Army and to 
refugees, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported. That did not help, the 
paper remarked, adding that power had been cut off "on a large 
scale" in business facilities and was being cut off gradually to 
private households. 
  The director of the Bagat-Zadar precision mechanics 
enterprise told a SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reporter that the firm, 
which employs about 800 workers, owed HEP DM100,000, or 
one-fifth of the amount the state owes Bagat-Zadar. The company 
will lose DM30,000 a day from the halting of its operations. The 
director of the Textile Industry-Zadar company said that his 
company owes HEP DM400,000, while the state owes the company 
DM200,000. According to the director, the power cut-off is 
costing the company DM100,000 a day. 
<H5>  Shares of Eight Enterprises Sold at Zagreb Auction </H5>
  A total of 1,686 shares of eight enterprises were sold by 
the 
Croatian Privatization Fund for a total of DM190,200 at an 18 
April auction in Zagreb, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported in its 19 
April issue. As a result of low demand, the paper said, all the 
shares were sold for the minimum price. Of the shares sold, 
1,054 were in the Riviera enterprise of Porec, 451 in 
Istraturist of Umag, 50 in Jadroplov of Split, 50 in PIK of 
Vrbovec, 30 in Plovidba-Holding of Losinj, 24 in Liburnija 
Hotels of Opatija, 20 in Jadrantourist of Rovinj, and four 
shares of Drava of Osijek. Except for those of Liburnija Hotels, 
with a price of DM1,000, all the shares sold for DM100. 
<H5>  Croatian-Italian Joint Venture in Rijeka </H5>
  The Lumic firm in Rijeka, a Croatian-Italian joint venture, 
was founded two years ago and has been producing men's clothing 
for export with a value of DM1.5 million per month. The 20 April 
SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported that the firm employs 400 workers 
and is located in a leased warehouse in the duty-free zone of 
the port of Rijeka. The firm has invested more than DM7 million 
in its facilities and equipment. Lumic's director told SLOBODNA 
DALMACIJA that the Italian partner, which is responsible for 
selling the clothing, is satisfied with the quality and 
favorable manufacturing cost of the firm's products and is ready 
to make additional investments. According to the director, 
planned expansion of the firm will cost DM25-30 million.

<F P=106> [Report by Dusan Drazic] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] On his way back from South Africa to 
Belgrade, President Zoran Lilic made a brief stop at Sofia 
airport. The two-hour stopover at Sofia airport attracted 
considerable attention by the media. More than 20 
correspondents from foreign agencies and the Bulgarian media met 
President Lilic, who responded to their appeal and answered 
several questions concerning the peace initiatives in the 
settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and 
relations in the Balkans. 
  [Drazic] I hope that we are now close to peace in the former 
Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was stated by 
Zoran Lilic, president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, at 
a news conference in the protocol building at Sofia airport this 
afternoon, where he spent a short period of time on his way back 
to Belgrade from his official visit to the Republic of South 
Africa and friendly Greece. 
  Peace negotiations could successfully be concluded if all 
sides in this conflict cared for peace. According to President 
Lilic, the step made in Geneva on 13 May -- that peace 
negotiations be held with the mediation of the European Union, 
including the United States -- is a move that could guarantee 
the stabilization of relations in this region. 
  According to the Yugoslav president, the first and most 
important precondition in the peace negotiations is the lifting 
of the sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council on 
Yugoslavia and the equal treatment of all three sides in the 
conflict on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Without 
acknowledging the interests of all three sides and without their 
agreement, it will be difficult to establish lasting peace, 
Lilic said. I hope the international community will also 
understand this. This is the correct way to finally settle the 
conflict in Bosnia. 
  One of the conditions is also not to give in under the 
pressure of great powers. The Serbian people in Bosnia must be 
granted what has already been granted to other peoples of the 
former Yugoslavia under the auspices of the United Nations, and 
this is the right to self-determination.

  [Text] Kragujevac, Yugoslavia, May 15 (TANJUG) -- There 
will be no autonomy or special status for ethnic minorities 
under a new bill that is shortly to be submitted to parliament 
for debate, says the Yugoslav human and minority rights 
minister. No document obligates the state to give anything like 
this to the minorities, said Minister Margit Savovic on Radio 
Kragujevac in Serbia on Sunday [15 May]. The rights enjoyed by 
the ethnic minorities in Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) ensure 
normal life and work for all their members, she emphasised. 
Minister Savovic was categorical that there would be no 
yielding to any kind of pressure in this matter, and added that 
there must be no difference made among the ethnic minorities and 
no picking and choosing which should have autonomy and which 
should not, because the law is the same for all. 
  The new bill should enable Yugoslavia to show to the world 
the kind of rights enjoyed by the minorities in this country, 
said Savovic. Asked to comment on a statement made by British 
Minister Douglas Hogg in Pristina, Serbia's province of 
Kosovo-Metohija, about a need for a dialogue between the 
authorities and the Albanian minority, Savovic said she was not 
sure what the minister had actually been referring to, but that 
any talks must not be to the detriment of the state. "We have 
many times before showed our readiness to open talks of this 
kind, but we cannot under any circumstances agree to talks on 
any form of special status. It is well known that the province 
of Kosovo-Metohija has autonomy and that the Albanians are not 
deprived in any way, but they do not want to avail themselves of 
it. Therefore, we cannot give more than what is provided under 
the constitutions of Serbia and Yugoslavia," said Savovic. 
  Kosovo-Metohija is being torn apart by the subversive 
activity of an ethnic Albanian separatist movement which is 
striving to detach the province from Serbia and its parent 
Yugoslavia and annexe it to neighbouring Albania. Under 
pressure from the separatist leaders, a section of the 
province's ethnic Albanian community has been refusing to 
exercise their rights to receive education in their own language 
and take part in the country's political life.

  [Text] Belgrade, 13 May (TANJUG) -- Industrial production 
has increased by 3.4 per cent in April, compared to March, 
Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic said today. He told 
reporters that the production level in March was almost equal to 
the average level last year, which means that the April increase 
in production indicates an increase in relation to the level 
last year. [sentence as received]

  [Text] Belgrade, 13 May (TANJUG) -- The relevant 
authorities shall warn conscripts who fail to respond to a 
general mobilization call up about the possibility of the use of 
force, although the period of time necessary for reporting 
cannot be shorter than 12 hours. This is the essence of the new 
Federal Government regulation on the mobilization of citizens, 
whose Article 35, as announced by the Federal Defense Ministry's 
information service, says: 
  "If citizens-conscripts do not respond to a general 
mobilization call up in numbers prescribed by individual 
mobilization plans, relevant district bodies, that is 
military-territorial bodies, will order the mobilization service 
to directly and personally inform the conscript who failed to 
report and warn him about the possibility of the use of force if 
he does not report in a period of time not shorter than 12 
hours." 
  One of the innovations in this regulation is that the 
mobilization of combat units and institutions will be carried 
out in due time and gradually and that, unlike what was 
prescribed by regulations until now, only certain institutions 
or parts of institutions, as well as an optimal number of 
conscripts needed for the consolidation of the country's defense 
system, will be liable to mobilization.

  [Text] Belgrade, 13 May (TANJUG) -- The General Staff of 
the Army of Yugoslavia issued a statement today reiterating that 
"there are no members of the Army of Yugoslavia outside of the 
borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and therefore not 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina either." 
  The statement reads: 
  "Some false reports of a rather primitive type on the 
participation of units of the Army of Yugoslavia in the war in 
the former Yugoslavia have again appeared in some media. These 
articles are trying to present the Army of Yugoslavia in the 
same light as the units of the regular Croatian Army, whose 
participation in combat activities in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is indisputable. 
  The General Staff of the Army of Yugoslavia has on several 
occasions, in connection with this, informed Yugoslav and world 
public that no members of its Army are outside the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. This fact has been acknowledged several 
times in statements by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] military 
officials and political functionaries of the countries whose 
forces are serving within UNPROFOR. 
  Reiterating accusations against the Army of Yugoslavia 
despite the facts in an atmosphere of a serious aggravation of 
the conflict raises the question of the motives and objectives 
of such risky schemes. 
  To assign blame for the war to an army that is not taking 
part in it, and to absolve of responsibility the forces that 
cause and aggravate it, cannot be seen in any other sense than 
propaganda support for the escalation of the war. 
  The General Staff of the Army of Yugoslavia again reiterates 
its commitment to the peaceful resolution of the conflict, while 
following with greatest attention the developments that could 
affect the security of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and 
the survival of the Serb people wherever they live. 
  There are no members of the Yugoslav Army anywhere outside 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and therefore not in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina either," the statement says.

  [Text] Belgrade, 16 May (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic today received Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian 
president's special envoy, who arrived in Belgrade late last 
night. Churkin informed Milosevic about the results of the 
recent ministerial talks in Geneva on the resolution of the 
conflict in the Balkans. 
  After the talks with Milosevic, which lasted for 90 minutes, 
Churkin said in a statement to reporters that he has come to 
Belgrade after a very important ministerial meeting in Geneva, 
"where we set the framework for what is -- I hope -- the 
completion of the process to resolve the conflict in Bosnia." 
  Churkin said that the participants of the Geneva talks are 
in 
contact "with all sides" to explain the possible effects and the 
essence of the decisions taken in Geneva. In that context he 
recalled that he has already held talks with Bosnian Muslim 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, but did not specify what 
response he received from him. He did, however, stress that 
"President Milosevic and Belgrade fully support the Geneva 
decisions on the ending of hostilities in Bosnia." 
  What after Geneva? The Russian envoy said that he will 
recommend to Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special 
envoy for Yugoslavia, that talks be arranged between the parties 
to the Bosnian conflict as soon as possible to try to achieve at 
least one target of the Geneva agreement-- an end to hostilities.

  [Text] Brcko, May 13 (TANJUG) -- Serbian Radical Party 
leader Vojislav Seselj said on Friday [13 May] that the crucial 
battle in the Bosnian civil war would be fought in the area of 
Brcko in the north, because Brcko was crucial to the Bosnian 
Serb republic and its loss would jeopardise the Serbs' very 
survival. Brcko is situated in the neck of a corridor in the 
Sava river valley. The corridor, which is only 5 km wide at 
this point, links the western and eastern parts of the Bosnian 
Serb republic, as well as the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) 
in the west and Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) in the east. 
  The R.S.K. was formed in [word indistinct] by the local 
Serbs 
in those parts within the arbitrary communist-era borders of 
Croatia where they are the majority population, in response to 
Croatia's violent secession from Yugoslavia and trampling on 
their rights. Speaking at a press conference at the close of a 
visit to Brcko, Seselj said that Croats and Moslems had no leg 
to stand on in the Sava river valley, 'even with the support of 
NATO, which can do little else except kill innocent civilians.' 
  Seselj, whose Radical Party is in opposition in the 
parliaments of both Yugoslavia and its constituent republics of 
Serbia and Montenegro, insists the Serbs must give no quarter in 
this battle for the survival of the western Serb states. 
Commenting on a map which the Croats and Moslems agreed on as 
the basis for their binational federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Seselj said that `this is something the Americans can do in 
Nevada, or Arizona, where they have lots of space and can do 
what they please, but here, they cannot reckon without their 
host.' 
  Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who have been fighting pitched 
battles for territories in central Bosnia and Herzegovina for 
over a year, met in Washington on March 18 and, acting under 
strong U.S. pressure signed an accord to form a binational 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would subsequently form 
a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. 
  At their U.S.-sponsored talks in Vienna earlier this week, 
they laid claim to 58 percent of Bosnian territory. Bosnian 
Serbs currently control 70 percent of the territory.

  [Text] Belgrade, 16 May (TANJUG) -- The revision of the 
refugee status has been completed in most of the municipalities 
in Serbia, Slobodan Popovic, Serbian deputy commissionaire for 
refugees, has told TANJUG. "Between 20 and 35 percent 
previously registered refugees have lost their status in the 
municipalities which have completed the revision." Many of them 
are already planning to return, in most cases after the school 
year ends. Most of the refugees will be returning to the 
Banjaluka, Bijeljina, and Baranja regions," Popovic says. 
  The revision of the status has not been completed yet in 
Belgrade, Novi Sad, Sabac, Sombor, and Kragujevac, the 
municipalities with the largest number of registered refugees. 
The revision in these municipalities has been extended until 
the end of May. This process has been completed for between 25 
and 30 percent of all refugees registered in Belgrade.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Mitric: "They Want `Radio Station'"] </F>
  [Text] Two national parties of the Hungarians and the 
Croats are "spiting" the state of Serbia and "making waves" in 
the domestic and international public in order to reheat the 
demand for [word indistinct] autonomy of the Hungarians and the 
cultural autonomy of the Croats from Tivat to Subotica. The 
Serbian Constitutional Court has, so far, quashed four failed 
decisions of the Subotica assembly and, some time soon, it is 
supposed to discuss the statute according to which the Croatian 
language is in official use in Subotica. 
  When this decision was being passed recently, Jelisaveta 
Palfi, who was the secretary of the communal assembly then, 
warned the councillors that these proposals do not adhere to the 
Constitution and the law and for doing so she earned "a 
dismissal" at one of the following sessions of the communal 
assembly. Her fate was shared by Erika Sarvat-Barati, secretary 
of the communal assembly in Senta, whom the councillors 
suspended from work merely because she warned them that they 
cannot annul the Serbian laws and Constitution by raising their 
hands. 
  Milovan Salatic, president of the district court in Subotica 
says that with the introduction of the Croatian language as an 
official one, the FRY Constitution has been violated: 
  "The Constitution stipulates that the Serbian language of 
the 
ekavian and ijekavian diction and the Cyrillic script is 
officially used in FRY. On the territories inhabited by the 
ethnic minorities, their languages and scriptures are in the 
official use too, in accordance with the law. However, here in 
Subotica it is not the Hungarian language that is controversial, 
but the Croatian. The FRY did not internationally recognize 
Croatia nor has Croatia recognized Yugoslavia, and thus the 
Croats in Yugoslavia do not have the status of an ethnic 
minority. For the time being, they are merely citizens of 
Serbia," Salatic says. 
  Even after the placement of the third advertisement, the 
councillors Hungarians and Croats did not endorse the 
appointment of the current editor, Slavica Lakicevic, to the 
post of chief editor [of the radio]. As the sole "publicly 
stated" reason they quoted an editor's "blunder" when Zeljko 
Raznjatovic Arkan appeared as a guest on the Serbian program. 
  "Disregarding the national and political implications of 
such 
a decision and its unconstitutionality, a question emerges as to 
how [words indistinct] carry out such a decision," Slavica 
Lakicevic, chief editor of the Serbian program, wonders. 
  The employees of Radio Subotica are dissatisfied that the 
founder is "disciplining" them. They have received maximum 
support from their listeners, especially Bunjevci [ethnic group 
of supposedly Croatian origins -- English term unknown] who, 
calling into the program yesterday, claimed that they actually 
did not know the Croatian language. 
  "Wherever the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians 
has power, with the help of their sympathizers they are passing 
the decision to suit their "[word indistinct]" so that when the 
minorities are in question, political tensions would constantly 
be present in Serbia, while there are portraying the abolition 
of these unlawful decisions of theirs to the world as a threat 
to their minority rights," Dragan Bozinovic, the governor of the 
Sava-Backa district, says. "With such decisions, they openly 
demonstrate their desire to be "a state." Bozinovic believes 
that had the Serbian Constitutional Court been more expeditious 
in assessing the constitutionality and legality of the Statute 
of the Subotica commune, this latest "scandal" about the 
Croatian language entering the program of the Radio Subotica 
"through the back door" would have been avoided. 
  However, [words indistinct] yesterday after the creation of 
"a case," president of the commune Jozef Kasa raised his voice 
and stated that the Serbian program of the Radio Subotica is 
interpreting the decisions of the assembly arbitrarily, 
misrepresenting them deliberately.

  [Text] Podgorica, 13 May (TANJUG) -- Montenegrin Prime 
Minister Milo Djukanovic said today that the hopes that 
Montenegro, as part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, will 
be given somewhat different treatment as regards sanctions are 
unrealistic. The international community is not even 
considering a partial relaxation of sanctions against Montenegro 
alone, and such a solution "would not be good for either 
Montenegro or Serbia," he said. 
  Speaking about a possible lifting of the sanctions against 
Montenegro, which has been talked about increasingly often among 
the public, Djukanovic said at a news conference that the only 
relaxation that Montenegro could expect is the reestablishing of 
traffic links with Italy and somewhat more generous humanitarian 
aid, due to the large numbers of refugees. 
  The Montenegrin prime minister stressed that the awareness 
of 
how senseless the sanctions are is gaining strength in the 
international community, for it is being realized that they have 
not achieved their objective. Asked how much the sanctions have 
cost Montenegro, Djukanovic said that the "amount of the losses" 
cannot be precisely quantified. However, he added, the lost 
exports and revenue from tourism, the non-functioning of the 
merchant fleet, and the inability to meet contractual 
obligations to foreign partners have so far cost Montenegro some 
$3.34 billion. 
  Speaking about new economic measures, Djukanovic mentioned a 
possible increase in salaries in the republic, but warned they 
have to be kept in line with other parameters, particularly with 
production.

  [Text] Gdansk, 13 May--Having returned from the meeting 
with defense ministers of Denmark and Germany on the island of 
Ruegen, National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, speaking 
at Gdansk-Rebiechowo airport today, expressed his satisfaction 
at the course and outcome of these talks, as far as both 
military and political subjects were concerned. 
  He said that, after Poland submitted its highly esteemed 
presentation document for the Partnership for Peace scheme, the 
case of our integration with the West took on a completely new 
dimension. 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk said that, during discussions on 
European political matters, the issue of Russia, whose policies 
are largely opaque and keep changing from day to day, was on 
top. In such a situation, it was decided to withhold all of the 
diagnoses and comments on this subject until the 25 May meeting 
in Brussels, one day after Russian Defense Minister Grachev's 
presentation of Russian military doctrine and Russian attitude 
toward the Partnership for Peace scheme. 
  The meeting participants have taken a completely unanimous 
stand, saying that Russian participation in the Partnership for 
Peace scheme can only take place on identical for all, 
partnerlike terms, Kolodziejczyk said. 
  Speaking about military aspects of our participation in the 
Partnership for Peace scheme, Kolodziejczyk said that discussion 
concerned mainly the question about what could be done this year 
and next, so that the new status of Poland could be implemented 
as soon as possible. The conclusion was that we should move 
over from cooperation at a tactical level to cooperation at the 
operational level as soon as possible. 
  Before the end of this year, we will have participated in 18 
joint exercises with NATO armed forces on Polish territory and 
in Western countries. Joint command and staff exercises will be 
held next year. 
  Kolodziejczyk stressed that the opening of NATO countries to 
cooperation in the operational art and technology sphere was a 
great step forward and a chance for the modernization of our 
armed forces. 
  During the meeting, the Danish side came out with an 
initiative that, as part of the Partnership for Peace scheme, 
cooperation with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia be strengthened. 
It was decided that, at the first stage, Sweden and Finland 
should take appropriate actions, and then Germany and Poland 
would join in. 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk also mentioned other actions aimed at 
the military integration with the West and about the 
Polish-German-French meeting, scheduled for July, as well as an 
agreement with Sweden concerning military technology. 
  "The pace of these actions is great, but I do not feel I am 
out of breath. One would like all other politicians to catch up 
with this pace because this is really a great opportunity for 
Poland," Kolodziejczyk said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski </F>
by an unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Sir, you have presented guidelines 
for Polish foreign policy, and they have been adopted by the 
parliament. Why was there such a need just at that moment to 
present the prospects of Polish foreign policy? 
  [Olechowski] This is a traditional annual address, which 
just 
happened to take place recently. It should really have taken 
place a month or a month and a half ago, but the political 
calendar in Poland is such that governments usually change in 
late fall, so that is why all the annual plans are published 
more or less in the middle of the year. We will have to think 
whether we should not change the budget calendar, and other 
things, just as is the case in other countries in the world 
where political calendars are such that, for example, the budget 
year begins on 1 April or 1 June. 
  We have such a custom that annual plans, plans for a 
particular year, are announced around the spring season. 
  [Correspondent] Foreign Minister, what are the basic aims of 
our foreign policy, and what do we want to achieve in the very 
near future? 
  [Olechowski] I spoke about this for 45 minutes in the Sejm 
this week so I can only briefly say that the aims are all 
classic ones. First, we want to live in a more secure world. 
In this respect, our foreign policy is undoubtedly a very 
essential tool in social actions. 
  Second, we want to live better and better, in the widest 
meaning of this word, so we can develop in an unrestrained 
manner when we have the best possible conditions for it. 
  Third, I think that each of us wants to have free contact 
with foreigners, to travel abroad, and to host foreigners here. 
These are also the tasks of foreign policy. 
  [Correspondent] There is a marked orientation of Polish 
foreign policy toward the West, but, having said that, we should 
not forget about the orientation toward the East. 
  [Olechowski] Orientation toward the West ensues from the 
fact 
that we feel connected, as it were, with that family of nations. 
It is there that our religion came from, it is there that our 
alphabet, civilization, and so on came from. Therefore, we feel 
we have ties to that part of the world. On the other hand, as 
long as there are West and East, because these directions can be 
blurred, the final, long-term, and most important aim would be 
that Europe become one whole, unified, and that there be no 
clear differences as we have today. We want to, and should, 
keep contacts with the East in every situation because you 
cannot not have contacts with your neighbors. This would 
immediately create a very dangerous situation. These relations 
can be closer or more distant ones, depending on how the 
neighbors behave, but we have to have some relations. 
  We always have to offer solutions, proposals that we want to 
have good relations with them and be friends. We have 
formulated such an offer, and such an offer has been accepted. 
There was an exchange of substantive, matter-of-fact letters 
between myself and [Russian Foreign] Minister Kozyrev, and now 
we have achieved a certain program of cooperation between two 
neighbors, two important countries for regional policy. 
  On the other hand, we disagree with how Europe should be 
built. We agree on the view that its final appearance should be 
undivided, but we see a way to achieve this differently. 
  [Correspondent] Poland is full of expectations of the West: 
We count heavily on Western help in both the economic and the 
political spheres. However, the past teaches us that such 
expectations often fail. Don't we have a similar situation now? 
Certain moves by Western politicians prove that they do not 
always understand our fears and our interests. 
  [Olechowski] To be polemical, in what way does the past 
say that we cannot count on this help? 
  [Correspondent] The year 1939, for instance. 
  [Olechowski] Perhaps there is a closer one. To be sure, we 
did not get $10,000 each in cash, preferably not into a bank 
account but in cash. But we did get, after the change of system 
and the undertaking of the difficulties of transformation, 
assistance that was significant, assistance in the stabilization 
of the zloty--$1 billion is no mean sum. The taxpayers there 
decided that this must be (?supported). We have also received 
significant assistance if we calculate over these past five 
years, and if we add up all the money that has been received 
from the group of the 24 most industrialized states, we would 
also get several billion. Also pay attention, please, to the 
fact that this money, these World Bank, IMF credits, could have 
gone elsewhere. After all, everyone in the world needs them, 
and there are very many countries that would wish to receive 
them. But they were directed to us. So, there was also a 
decision to be favorable. Finally, take a look at a matter as 
follows: We often say that the Europeam Union is protectionist, 
that it does not admit our goods. We are offended at this; 
however, without negating the fact that it is not sufficiently 
open, our exports there have grown over the past few years in 
stunning fashion. If they did not wish to admit these goods, 
really, then they would after all not admit them. So, this is 
also not so. It cannot be permitted to say that this is a 
closed world, that this is a world that does not want to help 
us, to allude to 1939--about which I also wish to say that, in 
the end, we won that war. So, it was also not the case that no 
one came with assistance. We will soon be marking the 50th 
anniversary of the Warsaw Rising, and we remember. We 
nonetheless have in our living thoughts the people who helped us 
here, the states that helped and the people who died helping the 
Poles. So, we often simplify. We ought not to do this. 
  [Correspondent] It is worthwhile, when speaking with you, to 
(?return to) Polish matters. Lately, we have had signals that 
there is no [word indistinct] in looking at Polish foreign 
policy through the basic centers of power. 
  [Olechowski] I do not perceive this that way beccause, 
please 
note, if any policy at all in Poland enjoys consensus, it is 
precisely foreign policy. I have eloquent proof of this. I 
have three times presented reports in the Sejm that required a 
vote. Two were adopted unanimously, and one had just a little 
opposition. So, please show me another area of policy--that is, 
another minister--who has attained such a result. This is not 
my character trait, just the fact that we all agree about these 
main aims. We, however, speak with different voices, and we 
often say various things that resound in different ways. But 
this does not mean that there is some sort of chaos here. Where 
is the chaos, and where is the lack of coherence and 
coordination, particularly in such concrete, day-to-day 
activities? We are aware of this. Ministerial politics 
flourished and flourish in Poland. Everyone cultivates his own 
little patch. That is in part perhaps the charm of our 
government. When one considers it a little, the Council of 
Ministers is a conference agreeing the views of the different 
ministries, and not a (word indistinct) that acts in one 
direction. But that is how it is conceived in essence, on 
principle, by the legislators. Here we propose to the 
government the undertaking of certain activities that will 
strengthen the coordinating role of the minister of foreign 
affairs.

  [Text] By 281 votes for to three against, Jaroslaw 
Kaczynski was elected chairman of the Center Alliance during the 
Third Congress of the party, which began in Warsaw today. 
Kaczynski has been party leader since 1990. I expected to be 
elected, but I cannot hide my surprise and emotion. I consider 
the election to be something extraordinary, he said. It puts me 
under the obligation to carry on with the difficult task of 
uniting the center-right, Kaczynski told the delegates, who sang 
to him "May You Live a Hundred Years." 
  Jaroslaw Kaczynski and guests invited to the congress talked 
about the future of the center-right, which aims at building a 
new Poland, efficient and law-abiding and with an economy that 
will open up opportunities for millions of Poles. 
  The congress is attended by the leaders of the parties 
making 
up the Alliance for Poland confederation: Wieslaw Chrzanowski, 
National Christian Union; Romuald Szeremietiev, Movement for the 
Republic; and Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski, Conservative 
Coalition.

<F P=106> [Article by Wojciech Zaluska: "Center Accord's </F>
Congress--Kaczynski Is Always Right"] 
  [Text] Although the Center Accord [PC] lost the 
elections and split internally several times already, Jaroslaw 
Kaczynski had no problem whatsoever with retaining the post of 
party chairman. 
  During a congress held on Saturday [14 May] and Sunday, he 
was supported by almost all 290 delegates. They responded to 
his speeches with standing ovations and voted for a list 
prepared by Kaczynski of candidates to the party's leadership. 
  Kaczynski was able to say then: "Our opponents"--he did not 
say who they were--"tried to destroy us using the Office of 
State Protection and attacks in the mass media. They did not 
succeed. We are stronger now than at any time in the past. The 
most dedicated activists have remained in the party. We have 
gotten rid of career-oriented ones and also of those whose 
assessments of the PC were based on GAZETA WYBORCZA and NIE 
weekly." 
<H5>  Just One Mistake </H5>
  During his 40-minute speech, the PC chairman admitted having 
committed just one mistake: He was not ruthless enough when it 
came to opposition inside the party: He had not thrown out 
Olszewski's supporters earlier, and he tolerated "party 
do-nothings." Apart from that, he has always been right. 
  But leaders of other center right-wing parties made a major 
mistake: They refused to join forces before the 19 September 
elections. As a result, the center right wing has no 
representatives in the Sejm, even though it could have had as 
many as 150. 
  Unification of the center right wing is goal number-one for 
Kaczynski. He made the first step, with the Christian-National 
Union, the Peasant Accord, the Movement for the Republic, and 
the Conservative Coalition. Last week, the "five" formed a 
confederation named "Alliance for Poland." They will gladly 
accept new members. Kaczynski repeated at the congress: "We 
have no enemies in the right wing." 
<H5>  Strong Words </H5>
  After a break lasting six months, Kaczynski returned to his 
strong anticommunist and anti-Walesa rhetoric. Depriving the 
Democratic Left Alliance, the Polish Peasant Party, and Lech 
Walesa of power is goal number-two for Kaczynski. The president 
is a danger to democracy and Instruction 0015 is a symbol of his 
rules. The postcommunists are reinstating arrangements that 
existed in the period of the Polish People's Republic [PRL], and 
they are waging a war on national traditions and the church. 
  Kaczynski argued that only the right wing is capable of 
severing ties to the PRL's legacies. Only the right wing is 
capable of "building a new Poland that would be free of the 
communist mentality." 
  Kaczynski wants to begin the process with a radical 
decommunization and file-checking [lustracja]. He announced the 
removal of "PRL people" from the Army, the police, the state 
administration, and banks. 
  "The Hungarian example shows that, without such measures, 
even four years of center right-wing rules bring bad results," 
Kaczynski said. He was making a reference to the recent 
election triumph by postcommunists in Hungary. 
  In Kaczynski's view, the postcommunists in Poland want to 
take advantage of the upcoming self-governmental elections in 
order to take over power in towns and villages. "It is our 
obligation to successfully resist the offensive," he appealed to 
his confederation partners. 
<H5>  Strzembosz for President </H5>
  The entire post-Solidarity camp should come up with just one 
candidate in the presidential elections. The center right wing 
has been promoting Supreme Court Chief Justice Adam Strzembosz, 
but it first wants Solidarity to approve him, followed by the 
Freedom Union. 
<H5>  Dispute About Punishment </H5>
  The congress was well prepared but boring. Everyone agreed 
with the chairman on everything, with one exception: When 
Kaczynski proclaimed a draft resolution calling for increasing 
the fight with crime, a storm broke out. 
  The PC chairman suggested radical measures: reinstating the 
death penalty, imprisoning even 13-year-old criminals, 
restricting conditional releases, punishing severely for drug 
trade and possession... Among others, former Senator Leszek 
Piotrowski argued with Kaczynski by saying that the restrictive 
ideas will get bad reception in the mass media and in Europe, 
with which we have been integrating. 
  But Kaczynski did not give up: "Crime is on the rise. The 
law must begin protecting victims, not criminals," he said. 
"One must increase police powers; murderers cannot be in a 
better position than their victims." 
  These arguments got a positive reception by the majority of 
candidates. The resolution was supported by 120 delegates, with 
70 against.

<F P=106> [Article by "SAR": "Alternative to Left Wing; Five </F>
Right-Wing Parties Form `Alliance for Poland'"] 
  [Text] The process of putting the right side of the 
political spectrum in order has begun. A coalition established 
on 10 November of last year, comprising Center Accord [PC], the 
Christian-National Union, Peasant Accord, the Movement for the 
Republic, and the Conservative Coalition, formed a confederation 
called the Alliance for Poland [Przymierze dla Polski--PDP]. As 
Kazimierz Ujazdowski told journalists on 12 May, it is a 
long-lasting and coherent alliance with a stable basis. 
  The goal of the new movement is to establish a formation 
capable of replacing the governing left wing and to lay to rest 
fears of the left wing's rules for many years to come. 
According to the PDP, left-wing rules are a big waste of the 
nation's collective time. PC Chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who 
will be serving in the post of confederation chairman for two 
months, stressed that the group is open to talks with other 
right-wing parties; negotiations with some of them are already 
under way. Acceptance of the principles contained in an 
ideological/program declaration is a precondition for joining 
the movement. Kaczynski stressed that it is a declaration of a 
party that is of a conservative nature and that is based on 
traditional, Catholic values that constitute the foundation of 
the group's measures. In the declaration, democracy was 
recognized as an intangible value, and the market economy and 
Poland's sovereignty were lauded. In addition, efforts to find 
a place for Poland in Western structures, including membership 
in NATO, the Western European Union, and European Union, were 
encouraged.

  [Text] Warsaw, 15 May--At the PSL [Polish Peasant Party] 
National Self-Government Congress on Sunday, the leader of the 
party, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, said that, at the end of 
the second millennium, Poland had an open future. 
  The prime minister thought the domestic situation gave good 
grounds for optimism. In the first quarter of this year, 
inflation was the lowest for seven years. Unemployment is 
falling and production is going up. "We are doing all of this 
with our own, rather than borrowed, money," he added. 
  "We cannot turn away from either the East or the West. We 
should be looking everywhere for partners who want to cooperate 
with us in an equable manner," the prime minister said. 
  Emphasizing that self-government should liberate initiatives 
and minds "directly on the ground," Pawlak urged the congress to 
back bold, active, and young people, members and sympathizers of 
the PSL. 
  "Today we need courage and resolute actions. I am counting 
on your involvement and victory, on our winning together," 
emphasized the PSL chairman. 
  The party is going into the local government elections under 
the slogan "Parishes need good masters." "The majority of the 
parishes are rural parishes. I believe we will come out of the 
elections as victors. And he who runs the parishes runs the 
country," Senate Speaker Adam Struzik said at the end of the PSL 
Self-Government Congress.

<F P=106> [Article by "wk": "Kolodko Visits Bankers"] </F>
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko has 
ambitious plans, and he is counting on banks to be his allies in 
the implementation of those plans. He spoke about what he wants 
to achieve while addressing bankers yesterday at the end of a 
conference devoted to developing the system of banking law in 
Central and East Europe. 
  "There will be no replacement of personnel in banks, and the 
government has no intentions of exerting such pressures," 
Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko assured bankers yesterday. A 
few days earlier, there were press reports that the government 
would replace governing boards in banks so as to make them 
support the government's economic policies more vigorously. 
  "I would like banks to be our allies in mobilizing the 
people 
to save more money," Kolodko said yesterday. The minister also 
denied rumors about plans to introduce taxes on savings and 
securities. 
  Kolodko repeated once again that, over the past five years, 
"one could have achieved more in the economy, and at a lower 
cost." He did not hear a farewell speech by Ian Hume, a World 
Bank representative in Poland since 1990, who said: "You can be 
proud of your achievements." Hume, who is ending his mission to 
Poland, now plans to trumpet our economic successes around the 
world. 
  The new finance minister presented his plans to the bankers. 
He believes he will bring down inflation (to less than 10 
percent in 1997) and the budget deficit (from 4.1 percent of the 
GDP to 2 percent), as well as the unemployment level. In 
Kolodko's view, the government's economic policies will be "more 
socially sensitive." 
  Kolodko also announced that, through privatization, he will 
settle the issue of Poland's foreign debts: Investors will be 
able to buy Polish debts and then exchange them for shares of 
companies subject to privatization. 
  "We have a very good privatization program, but we also need 
to take care of higher budget revenues," Kolodko said. In his 
view, revenue from privatization was not too high over the past 
four years--that is, in the range of about 0.37 percent of the 
GDP. According to his calculations, the budget lost three times 
as much. 
  The minister promised that, in the immediate future, he will 
present detailed proposals and instruments with which he intends 
to achieve these ambitious plans.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roman Czerwinski, deputy minister of </F>
industry and trade, and Stanislaw Glowacki, chairman of 
Solidarity's national armaments industry section, by 
correspondent Katarzyna Klukowska; place and date not given; 
from the "Bilans" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Klukowska] There are ever more strikes and 
demonstrations taking place in Poland. Last Friday it was the 
Solidarity national armaments industry section that protested. 
The continuation of such policies by the government of the 
Polish Republic is read by the work forces of armanents industry 
enterprises as indicating an intention to liquidate this sector 
of industry. This may cause an unimaginable social explosion, 
for the consequences of which the Government of the Polish 
Republic will bear responsibility. 
  [Czerwinski] I think that the internal restructuring 
processes, supported by certain decisions at the level of both 
parliament and the government, the law on special regulations in 
the sphere of ownership transformations, constitute a certain 
political and economic indication of the fact that the 
government nonetheless is in favor of the maintenance of this 
industry, that this industry is necessary both for our economy 
and, above all, for our defense preparedness. And we will be 
doing what we are doing, but able to do so in the sphere of 
rescuing this industry. 
  [Klukowska] The armaments industry consists of over 80 
enterprises. Just a few years ago, we earned at least several 
hundred million dollars from the sale of arms every year, being 
the third placed exporter, after the former Soviet Union and 
Czechoslovakia, of the countries of CEMA. 
  [Czerwinski] The arms trade market is nonetheless a market 
that is very brutal and a market for professionals. The gun 
scandal precisely was an example of an instance where what was 
in practice a private company tried, without government 
protection, without the protection of the special services, to 
strike a particular deal. It was trapped by a straightforward 
provocation, one that could have been discovered much earlier. 
  [Klukowska] It transpires that over 70 percent of the 
products of the armaments industry are civilian production, and 
it is precisely in this that many, inter alia the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade, see an opportunity for bringing this branch 
of the national economy back to health. 
  [Czerwinski] Were we to rest the restructuring of the 
industry solely upon supplies to the Polish Army, solely upon 
export opportunities, this industry would not be capable of 
getting out of this enormous trough. That is why we decided to 
go for, above all, legal regulations and the protection of this 
industry in its special role and, thus, payment for an economic 
mobilizaton plan, which was adopted last year, preferential 
treatment as regards purchases by the Ministry of National 
Defense, protection and assistance by government offices for 
export opportunities. This, of course, very often taking into 
account certain international implications, as also the 
associations between particular enterprises of ours. 
  [Klukowska] What is the situation of the armaments sector at 
this moment? 
  [Glowacki] Tragic. If I say that at this moment remuneration 
has since last year, since the notorious consultation meeting, 
increased in essence by 500,000 zlotys [Z] and varies around a 
level of Z2.8 million, this is witness to what the mood is, what 
the situation is in these plants, and what can possibly be 
expected in the near future. 
  [Klukowska] Is the issue just remuneration or the fact that 
you are producing, we as a state produce equipment that is not 
all bad, but for which there is no use? 
  [Glowacki] Also so. Also so, although this situation is 
subject to change insofar as the enterprises are themselves 
attempting to counteract it. Nonetheless, without systemic 
solutions, without decisions at the level of government, we will 
unfortunately end up stewing in our juices. 
  [Klukowska] When listening to trade unionists, one gets the 
impression that you, with your optimistic faith in the future, 
are nonetheless an isolated figure. They do not have such 
optimistic perspectives. 
  [Czerwinski] I think this transpires from a certain long 
expectation. The first signs of improvement are appearing. It 
seems that it is at this moment appropriate to exchange this 
very long expectation, these starved work forces, for concrete 
economic results. The year 1994 will already be the year of 
breakthrough. It will be a year of growth, improvement of the 
economic situation of both enterprises and work forces as 
against this background. On the other hand, we expect a clear 
improvement; we can expect it in the years 1995-96. The 
enterprises ought to return to a standard level of economic 
efficiency on the order of 5-6 percent [as heard]. For this 
year, we would wish to bring about a situation in which all of 
the enterprises have in practice a net profit close to zero and 
thus are not yet too profitable but, on the other hand, do not 
bring losses.

<F P=106> [Article by Tadeusz Jastrzebski: "Single-Digit Inflation?"] </F>
  [Text] Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, Polish National Bank 
chairman, said recently that inflation in Poland could be 
reduced to single-digit values within three to four years. In 
turn, Miroslaw Pietrewicz, head of the Central Planning 
Administration, estimated in his forecast for the next few years 
that, by 1997, inflation could amount to 12 percent. 
  If we remember that, in 1989, inflation reached more than 
500 
percent and that last year it still amounted to almost 40 
percent, a realistic expectation of 10-percent inflation must be 
seen as excellent progress. Here, however, we come to the 
question of the true feasibility of such a result. 
  This year, inflation should reach some 26 percent. The 
beginning of the year was very good: In January and February, 
prices went up by a little over 1 percent (each month, of 
course). However, the March figures were only half as good, 
with price hikes of 2.6 percent. It is too early to say 
anything with certainty about April, but it seems that, if the 
results are only half as good as in March, they will be good 
enough in the circumstances. Inflation depends on many other 
things in addition to wage increases, but that factor has still 
to be taken seriously into consideration. Almost everyone (apart 
from trade union activists) insists that wage control is still 
essential in Poland and that allowing unrestricted wage 
increases is bound to result in rising inflation. 
Unfortunately, the situation we have witnessed since the 
beginning of April is starting to look like a deliberate game of 
provoking inflation. The president refuses to sign the 
neopopiwek [enterprise tax on above-normative wages] act. The 
prime minister says one day that we need the act, the next that 
we can do perfectly well without it, and the day after that that 
the coalition is in favor of introducing the neopopiwek after 
all. 
  The Sejm finally approved the latest version of the wage 
control bill, and, if all goes well, the resultant parliamentary 
act will come into force by mid-May. If all goes well, that is, 
because, although the president did agree that, for the time 
being, wage control is necessary, that does not necessarily mean 
that he will definitely endorse the new act. Let us hope he 
will, but, even if he does, it will be a month and a half too 
late. What will happen to wages and prices in that time? We 
only need to look at what is happening to them already. The 
result will be that our long-term goal--that is, single-digit 
inflation in a few years' time--will still be a realistic 
proposition, but the path leading to it will become progressivly 
longer and more difficult, as it has become longer and more 
difficult over these past few weeks. But that long-term goal is 
not something we are seeking in the abstract, for its own sake. 
This truth seems to be forgotten by those who should be most 
interested in good economic results because the ultimate 
assessment of their administration will largely depend on their 
performance in that sphere.

<F P=106> [Article by Piotr Zajdel: "The Ecological Zero Option"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Army of the Russian Federation left Poland 
with a great deal of ecological damage and "souvenirs." The most 
dangerous of these are the pollution of the soil and the water 
table by chemical waste and petroleum lines. The estimated cost 
of the damage is approximately 52 billion zlotys [Z]. 
  Already in the 1980's, the Polish Ecological Services tried 
sporadically to control pollution from some of the Soviet 
military bases. Most of these efforts failed because "outsiders" 
were not permitted to enter Soviet bases. Not until May 1992 did 
the situation change, after the signing of a Polish-Soviet 
agreement on the removal of Soviet forces from Poland. Joint 
inspections of both Polish and Russian bases began. The result 
of all of this was ecological standards that were incorporated 
into the agreements for transferring the former Soviet military 
bases to the Poles. "We have documented the magnitude of all the 
damage caused, and we have calculated the costs," stated Andrzej 
Walewski, the Main Inspector for Environmental Protection. 
  "The Russians left without paying for the ecological damage 
they committed, so, in turn, we are not going to pay them for 
any of the equipment they left behind," stated Walewski. 
According to him, Poland won the battle with a political 
success, while the Czechs and Hungarians incurred many costs 
during the Soviet pullout. "The fact that our country had 
documentation on the ecological damage played a great 
psychological role," stated Walewski. 
  Of 59 sites that were occupied by the Soviets, 35 had the 
potential to be ecological hazards. The National Inspector for 
Environmental Protection chose 21 sites believed to be the most 
contaminated. The inspections included all of the air bases, 
large fuel depots, ammunition dumps, and firing ranges. 
  Tests were conducted on underground water to see if there 
was 
chemical contamination. "Water was inspected both above and 
below ground. Also, the damage done in forests and on roads and 
contamination from chemical and nuclear weapons were examined," 
stated Walewski. These tests were conducted on the grounds of 
the bases and around them. Hydrological tests are being 
conducted on a wide scale by using bore-hole methods. 
Physiochemical tests of the water and water table are being done 
in specialized laboratories. The tests are conducted at 
government expense, and, to complete them, it is estimated that 
the cost will be approximately Z14 million. 
  The tests are being funded by Polish zlotys exclusively and 
under the direction of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. 
The Military Technical Academy will also participate in the 
tests in tandem with other research groups. 
  The damage may be assessed at Z52.2 billion. "This is a 
rather abstract sum, a sum we would have to pay in order to 
fully recultivate the land," stated Walewski. [passage omitted] 
The majority of the funds will come from the national budget. 
The Environmental Protection group has developed a special 
ranking in terms of money and in terms of which area will be 
"cleaned" first. The cleaning will take place first in the most 
contaminated areas. These areas are: Kluczewo, in the Szczecin 
voivodship; Brzeg, in the Opole voivodship; and Swinouscie and 
Borne Sulinowo in the Koszalin voivodship. Let us not forget 
that the Soviet forces were stationed on Polish soil from World 
War II until 17 September 1993, over an area of 70,000 hectares 
and 59 bases. Their stay was legitimized by an agreement between 
the People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman </F>
Gyula Horn by Szendrei in Miskolc on 11 May: "The Country Has 
To Be Put In Order"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Szendrei] Would you now 
have the courage to predict the final results for the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] at the elections? 
  [Horn] Naturally, it is difficult to enter into such 
predictions. I would very much like our individual candidates 
to gain as many mandates as possible. There is a chance for the 
majority to win the elections. It is no accident that they had 
such good results in the first round. I continue to have faith 
in the sober judgment of the voters. 
  [Szendrei] Do you think it possible for the MSZP to gain an 
absolute majority in parliament? 
  [Horn] I think this is also possible. The MSZP was the 
party that offered the real political change, therefore, it is 
not out of the question for us to reach more than 66 percent. 
  [Szendrei] Does this mean that Hungary might end up with a 
one-party government? 
  [Horn] I continue to hope for the government to have as many 
political forces as possible, or for it to have their support. 
This would be good for the country and for handling the very 
serious heritage we are facing. We will have to begin putting 
this in order immediately after the round on 29 May. The 
country has to be put in order. It cannot carry on the way it 
is. 
  [Szendrei] I will ask again: Will your party be willing to 
govern on its own? 
  [Horn] If the voters wish, and if our support is so big that 
we can undertake this on our own, then we will. We have never 
yet run away from any tasks. 
  [Szendrei] After the first round, have you discussed a 
possible coalition with the Free Democrat leaders? 
  [Horn] No. I know that, after my accident, the Free 
Democrat leaders immediately spoke to [Deputy Chairman] Imre 
Szekeres and wished me a speedy recovery through him, but 
political talks did not take place between the two parties at 
all. [passage omitted] 
  [Szendrei] In the interview you gave to the Television's 
News program, you categorically refuted that you might be 
supporting Gabor Kuncze [prime ministerial candidate of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats] as prime ministerial candidate. 
Does this mean that you will apply for the prime ministerial 
position? 
  [Horn] As it has already been announced, the MSZP will hold 
an extraordinary congress and the party's prime ministerial 
candidate will be selected there. 
  [Szendrei] How will the MSZP begin to govern? 
  [Horn] First of all, it is most important to get a realistic 
view of the country's situation. We have only partial 
information on the past four years, we do not have a full view 
of the situation. I am afraid that, when it comes to defining 
the practical tasks of governing, we will find far graver 
details than those we are aware of at present. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, has had a telephone conversation 
with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Christopher 
called President Izetbegovic to inform him about the U.S. 
standpoint on the resolution of the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United States believes the Bosnian side 
will not miss this opportunity for peace and that a solution can 
be found in the plans put forward by the international 
community's contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina. President 
Izetbegovic reiterated our resolve to persevere with the peace 
process and said that the Bosnian side was very clear on this 
subject and that at the same time, it also demanded respect for 
the vital interests of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unitary state.

  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] First of all, President 
Izetbegovic analyzed the latest agreement on the Bosniak-Croat 
federation and the Contact Group's communique in Geneva. 
Speaking at a news conference in Sarajevo about the 
Bosniak-Croat agreement, President Izetbegovic stressed: 
  [Izetbegovic] "What we are interested in is their urgent 
implementation [sentence as heard]. We will not allow the 
dynamics of their implementation to be slowed down. We will try 
to speed up their implementation and remove obstacles in the way 
of achieving this. 
  ``Regarding other things, I can only restrict myself for the 
moment to talking about the problem of whether or not to go to 
these talks--something referred to in yesterday's communique--we 
will go to these talks. We believe that a refusal to go to the 
talks will be an own goal and will only help the aggressor to 
continue waging the war and shift the blame on to us. We are 
not for war but for peace. 
  ``As for the talks, of course--this is not a 
precondition--but we expect and demand that in the meantime, in 
the next few days, the problem of Gorazde be resolved in keeping 
with the NATO pact ultimatum and the corresponding resolutions. 
Above all, I am thinking of the withdrawal of Serb soldiers 
from the three-kilometer zone. This is not a precondition for 
attendance at the talks, but unless this happens, we believe 
that this must be fulfilled--of course this is not a 
precondition, this is a matter of carrying out of an earlier 
decision that was not fully respected and that brings into 
question the credibility of the international community, and of 
course brings into question the justification and the reason for 
organizing any conference or making any decisions if the 
decisions cannot later be implemented." 
  [Correspondent] Dwelling on yesterday's communique by the 
Contact Group, President Izetbegovic drew attention to both its 
positive and negative points. 
  [Izetbegovic] "Positive--because we are persevering in 
maintaining the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its survival 
within the internationally recognized borders. Positive--also 
because it advocates aid for reconstruction once peace is 
established and furthermore, because it advocates resolve for 
the implementation of the existing UNSC resolutions, the 
continuation of humanitarian aid deliveries, and the free 
passage of convoys, while refusing to meet the demand of the 
Serb side to abolish the sanctions before the negotiations begin. 
  ``The bad points of this communique--not to say negative--we 
see because it mentions Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union. As you 
know we have opted for a federation. It also mentions the 
notorious 51-49 percent division [words indistinct]. At the 
same time, there is a certain degree of readiness in the 
communique to gradually abolish the sanctions. 
  ``Finally, as far as the cessation of hostilities is 
concerned, we are thinking of a temporary cessation and in our 
opinion a four- month period is too long. A two-month period 
would be quite sufficient if a political resolution is desired. 
A four-month period is unacceptable."

  [Text] [Announcer] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
received a delegation from the town of Daruvar led by Mayor Ivan 
Cegledi. The delegation informed the president about the crime 
committed by the chetniks in which five people from Vukovje were 
killed, including four Croatian refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The mayor of Daruvar spoke about the difficult economic, 
social, and security situation. He particularly stressed that 15 
people had been killed in the Daruvar municipality since the 
arrival of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. Despite this, the 
local authorities, in cooperation with UNPROFOR, have created 
conditions for the return of some 500 people of Serb 
nationality, as a sign of good will in the search for a 
political resolution of the crisis and a peaceful reintegration 
of the Croatian areas under the UNPROFOR protection into the 
constitutional system of the Republic of Croatia. 
  The delegation delivered a petition from citizens of 
Vukovje, 
demanding adequate protection against possible new crimes and 
the immediate departure of UNPROFOR from the area. 
  President Tudjman expressed his condolences over the tragic 
deaths and stressed that relevant state organs would, in 
cooperation with UNPROFOR, do their utmost to find the 
perpetrators of the crime and provide full protection and 
security to the local population. The president stressed at the 
same time that this was yet more evidence for the international 
community of an undoubtfully difficult situation in Croatian 
areas under UNPROFOR protection and of UNPROFOR's inefficiency. 
He stressed the international community had to realize what 
crimes by the Serb terrorists and occupiers we had to face and 
the Republic of Croatia could not indefinitely tolerate this 
situation. The president warned if UNPROFOR's inefficiency 
remained unchanged the world would have to acknowledge the right 
of the Croatian state to -- after the expiry of the UNPROFOR 
mandate -- liberate and reintegrate all its areas using all 
means available to an internationally recognized state.

  [Text] On the occasion of the completed Croat-Bosnian 
negotiations President Tudjman sent letters to U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Cristopher, as well 
as to the foreign ministers of the Russian Federation, France, 
Germany, Germany, Great Britain, the Kingdom of Belgium, and 
Greece, the president's office has reported. President 
Tudjman's letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton reads as follows: 
  Esteemed Mr. President: It is with particular pleasure that 
I wish to inform you that the negotiations between the Croat and 
the Bosnian delegations concerning the comprehensive 
implementation of the Washington Agreements have been brought to 
a successful conclusion. I would like to express particular 
gratitude to the U.S. Administration and to you personally, Mr. 
President, for your role in the search for lasting and just 
solutions for the achievement of peace through the realization 
of the Croat-Bosnian Federation and Confederation. Let me once 
again assure you that the Republic of Croatia will remain firmly 
committed to the spirit and letter of the Washington and Vienna 
Agreements, wishing to be a factor of stability in this part of 
Europe and a permanent partner of the United States in the 
promotion of peace and stability in this part of Europe. The 
leading role of your country in the achievement of a lasting 
political solution is crucial in this, the final stage of the 
peace process. Any freezing of the present state of affairs and 
any delay in this solution only prolongs human agony and 
threatens peace in the greater European area. This is why the 
present peace efforts of the international community should be 
focused on shaping the means and guarantees for the 
implementation of the achieved agreements and decisions of the 
international community. Let me remind you once again that the 
problems of the Serbian occupation of parts of the Republic of 
Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina are inseparable, 
and let me reiterate the need to seek a lasting solution through 
an integral approach of the international community to the 
problem. Mr. President, I am firmly convinced that, with your 
personal involvement and the moral and every other determination 
of your administration, we will soon be able to focus our 
efforts on issues such as the return of refugees to their homes, 
economic reconstruction, reconciliation, and the strengthening 
of democratic processes to create a new, stable international 
order in this part of Europe. Signed, Yours Sincerely, Tudjman. 
  In a letter that President Tudjman sent to U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher and the foreign ministers of the 
countries that took part in the Geneva talks, President Tudjman 
said, inter alia: I wish to thank the governments of your 
countries on their support for the peace process, especially to 
the U.S. Government, which actively mediated in efforts to reach 
a solution between the Croats and the Bosnians. At the present 
stage of seeking a political solution in former Yugoslavia we 
see as decisive your determination to bring the Serbian side 
around to accepting a just political solution and, if necessary, 
impose such a solution on the forces obstructing the peace 
process, Tudjman said in his letter to the foreign ministers.

  [Text] Pristina, 13 May (TANJUG) -- President of the 
Democratic Alliance of Kosovo (DSK) Ibrahim Rugova said today 
that his party would continue its activities despite 
announcements that it would be outlawed. At a news conference 
Rugova described as "a provocation" the statement by the head of 
Kosovo district Milos Simovic that the authorities should ban 
the DSK for failing to register. He warned that this could be 
"a dangerous move" and that such a decision "would not be taken 
lightly by the international democratic public." Rugova claims 
that his party was registered in the former SFRY, that it was in 
possession of valid registration documents, and stressed that it 
would continue its work even if banned.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pal Csaky, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Christian Democratic Movement Deputies Club, by Jana 
Pankovcinova; place and date not given: "Revising the Borders 
in Europe Is Not Involved in the Stability Pact"] 
  [Text] The Hungarian parties in the Slovak Republic have 
been accused by the opposition of wanting to take part in the 
negotiations of the European Union (EU) on the so-called 
Stability Pact, whereas only Slovak constitutional officials 
should represent sovereign Slovakia; otherwise, the Slovak 
Republic's sovereignty and borders would be endangered. In this 
context, we asked P. Csaky to discuss the Stability Pact and 
assess the views being expressed about it. 
  [Csaky] The Stability Pact is being formulated at the level 
of the EU and the East European states, and its initiator is 
French Prime Minister Balladur. I understand some of the 
approaches adopted by Slovak politicians who want to savor the 
decisionmaking on the Slovak Republic's political orientation. 
The Stability Pact is intended to prevent possible conflicts in 
our region. It is not oriented against the sovereignty of any 
state. If the status of the minorities is also to be discussed 
in association with it, we would like to put forward our point 
of view. However, at the moment, it looks as though the 
minorities will not participate directly in the negotiations. 
  [Pankovcinova] Opinions are being expressed by the current 
opposition that the Stability Pact could also mean a certain 
revision of the borders in Europe.... 
  [Csaky] I can reject this unequivocally. I know in detail 
the text of the Stability Pact and the European Union's 
proposals. Nothing is said there about any such eventuality. 
This is merely an old formula for defining the Slovak 
Republic's enemies. The EU is becoming unified, it has accepted 
another four members, and it has expressed its interest in 
further unification. We are also declaring our endeavor to 
enter Europe and come closer to the EU. If this is really the 
case, there is no point in just talking about it; we have to 
adopt specific measures, take part in the negotiations on the 
Stability Pact, and sign it. Thus, we would be making a 
specific commitment toward a united Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by "(r)": "Slovak Politicians on the Stability </F>
Pact"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--I consider the Stability Pact to be a 
kind of umbrella that will cover bilateral negotiations and 
agreements between the participating states. This statement was 
made yesterday by Christian Democratic Movement Chairman Jan 
Carnogursky on Slovak Radio's Radiozurnal program. Prime 
Minister Jozef Moravcik said in this context that the Slovak 
Government is considering this plan carefully and, at the 
moment, is devoting attention to the text of the document that 
should be adopted. "We can only accept the whole plan under the 
prerequisite that it complies with our interests," said the 
prime minister. Milan Ftacnik, chairman of the Party of the 
Democratic Left Deputies' Club, said that, in the original plan, 
the questions of adjusting the borders were modified; they were 
unacceptable for the idea of Europe as it is arranged today, 
where any kind of movement on the borders may have unforeseen 
consequences. "Nevertheless, it is necessary to discuss the 
pact because a joint point of view on resolving the problems 
that exist between countries--first and foremost, on the issue 
of the minorities--is desirable, and I think that the Slovak 
Republic is ready for the pact," emphasized Ftacnik. 
  Jozef Prokes, honorary chairman of the Slovak National 
Party, 
expressed his conviction that the Stability Pact "will lead to 
the destabilization and not the stabilization of this region." 
"The countries that adopted an intolerant attitude toward the 
minorities will be given a large whip against the countries that 
have been tolerant, and I personally consider this to be 
interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Europe 
toyed with minority ideas in the 1930's, and it all turned out 
very badly. The Stability Pact now envisages bilateral 
negotiations between neighboring countries under the supervision 
of a third country. In other words, the European Union is 
expressing its lack of confidence in the competence and 
capability of the countries of Central and East Europe to 
resolve their own problems," he said.

  [Text] At the last experts meeting about the Pact of 
Stability in Athens, Slovakia succeeded in pushing through its 
demands. This has created conditions to enable the Pact of 
Stability to become a suitable platform for the implementation 
of the foreign policy interests of Slovakia. This was said by 
Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik in an interview given to the Press 
Agency of the Slovak Republic in connection with the preparation 
of his official visit to France, where he is to discuss, among 
other things, this initiative. Prime Minister Moravcik envisages 
that, at this stage, the drafting of the documents for the Pact 
of Stability is acceptable to Slovakia. In this connection, he 
stressed that the pact unequivocally respects and promotes the 
principle of the inviolability and immutability of borders.

  [Text] Kalman Petocz, spokesman of the Hungarian Civic 
Party, stressed at the party's news briefing held in Bratislava 
today that forming a coalition [by the ethnic Hungarian parties 
and movements in Slovakia] before the scheduled 30 September and 
1 October elections would be a positive step and might 
contribute to the collaboration of people having a democratic 
approach. He stressed that the Hungarian Civic Party 
unanimously supports the establishment of a tripartite coalition 
by the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, the Coexistence 
Political Movement, and the Hungarian Civic Party. The party 
regards the Coexistence's proposal for a union of the ethnic 
Hungarian parties as a positive step. However, it considers it 
impracticable and unacceptable from the political point of view. 
If a tripartite coalition is not formed, only one opportunity 
will be left for us--to run separately in the elections, just as 
happened two years ago--the Hungarian Civic Party's spokesman 
stressed at today's news briefing.

<F P=106> [Article by "dos": "Idea of Union of Hungarian Parties Is </F>
Not Feasible Before Elections"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian 
Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH], considers the idea of 
establishing a union of the four ethnic Hungarian parties, 
proposed by the Coexistence movement, "not feasible before the 
elections." As Bela Bugar said in an interview for SME, "The 
Hungarian parties had a chance to prove that they are able to 
cooperate. They have been unable to accomplish this in four 
years." The process of approving the formation of such a union 
by the political bodies of the participating parties cannot be 
completed by the time of the elections, in his opinion. In view 
of the fact that the Hungarian People's Party does not engage in 
any activity, according to Bugar, the MKDH proposes the 
formation of a coalition of three partners: 
MKDH-Coexistence-Hungarian Civic Party [MOS]. According to MOS 
spokesman K. Petocz, MOS is open to talks on any alternative and 
positively assesses the fact that Coexistence proposes something 
common for all ethnic Hungarian parties. As Petocz went on to 
say, however, MOS "does not consider it fortunate to come up, a 
few weeks before the elections, with proposals that are legally 
vague and the practical implementation of which is unclear." 
According to Petocz, the union would be the sole legal entity 
within which the present parties could operate only as some kind 
of factions. "We do not advocate the liquidation of pluralism 
within the framework of the Hungarian minority and do not 
consider it necessary," the MOS spokesman added.

  [Text] A two-day session of the first congress of the 
Communist Party of Slovakia [KSS] ended in Levice today with the 
adoption of final documents. The party's policy reaffirms that 
the KSS is a Marxist party, the objective of which is to build 
socialism, a democratic society with political and economic 
plurality, a society that would be self-administered, 
prosperous, and socially just. The party's policy says that if 
this party fails to win a partner for a joint course of action, 
it will go into the elections as an independent political 
entity. The delegates reelected Vladimir Dado as KSS chairman, 
and (Ladislav Jaco) was elected KSS central secretary.

<F P=106> [Article by "rk": "National Democratic Party: 30,000 to </F>
40,000 per Coupon Book"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The offer of the Christian Democratic 
Movement [KDH] to accept other parties' candidates on its slate 
of candidates blocks the possibility of forming a coalition, 
which creates a new situation for the National Democratic Party 
[NDS], Andrej Findo told yesterday's NDS briefing. Anton Hrnko 
added that it should be in the political parties' interest to 
prevent the fragmentation of political entities so that the 
situation of the 1992 elections does not recur when a movement 
supported by one-third of voters gained almost one-half of the 
seats in the National Council of the Slovak Republic. Hrnko, 
who attended the elections in Hungary as an observer, noted that 
they took place in a calm and fair atmosphere and were 
distinguished by a minimum of advertising. He said that the NDS 
proposes that changes to the election law focus on increasing 
the number of constituencies from four to seven and on imposing 
a strict limit on campaign spending (a sum of about 20 million 
Slovak korunas was being considered in the Coalition Council, on 
the basis of U.S. and French experiences). At today's meeting 
of the Coalition Council, which will discuss the further 
orientation of privatization, NDS representatives (Minister 
Milan Janicina, Vladimir Miskovsky, and Andrej Findo) will push 
for the use of a combination of privatization methods and a 
flexible solution to individual specific cases. However, they 
will assert that coupon privatization is their own contribution 
to this discussion, Findo said, adding that they want to achieve 
that citizens receive an average of 30,000-40,000 Slovak korunas 
worth of property per coupon book.

<F P=106> [Article by Juraj Alner: "Colorful Mixture for Preelection </F>
Stew; There Are 38 Parties and 19 Movements in Slovakia"] 
  [Text] The preelection period starts with the question of 
which parties (movements) are registered in Slovakia, which of 
them will participate in the elections, and on what basis some 
of them will be allowed to participate and others not. We 
therefore publish an updated list of parties and movements that 
are registered as of today with the Ministry of Interior of the 
Slovak Republic. 
  The parties and movements are listed in chronological order, 
according to the registered date of their founding. The 
Democratic Party is the oldest party. Although the Freedom Part 
is also old, it had suspended its activity and resumed it only 
recently. 
  A party (movement) can be founded under conditions set out 
in 
National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] Law No. 47/1993, 
which changes and amends Law No. 424/1991 on association in 
political parties and political movements. 
  Hence, it still holds true that, to set up a party 
(movement), it is necessary to submit a petition signed by at 
least 1,000 citizens who, apart from their signatures, list 
their first names, surnames, birth registration numbers, and 
complete addresses. 
  Of the 38 parties and 19 movements (or any other parties and 
movements that will be registered in time), only those will be 
able to participate in the elections that will meet the special 
regulations set out in Slovak National Council Law No. 80/1990 
on elections to the Slovak National Council, as amended by the 
law of 26 February 1992. Essentially, the same criteria will 
apply as during preceding elections. 
  The slates of candidates must be submitted 60 days before 
the 
election date--that is, 60 days before 30 September. The 
condition for a party (movement) to run is to have at least 
10,000 individual members. If it has fewer members, it must 
submit a petition signed by as many citizens as will supplement 
the missing number so as to reach 10,000. Again, the petition 
must contain all of the data necessary to identify the person in 
question. 
  This condition need not be met by parties that were 
represented in the NRSR 60 days before the elections were 
called--that is, 60 days before 25 April, when the NRSR chairman 
promulgated the election date. By the same token, this 
condition need not be met by parties that gained at least 10,000 
votes in the preceding elections, even if they did not make it 
into parliament. 
  You will find the list of parties from which we will be able 
to choose, as well as their programs and intentions, in our 
newspaper in due course. It is apparent already that the 
mixture will be a colorful one.

<F P=106> [Article by "kob": "No New Meciar Government After </F>
Elections"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Slovak President Michal Kovac stated in 
an interview with Austrian journalists that he does not believe 
that Vladimir Meciar will succeed in forming a coalition after 
the elections in October. 
  Kovac, who will be visiting Austria next week, declined to 
answer the question of whether he would ask an election winner 
Meciar to form a government: "I have not yet made a decision," 
he pointed out. 
  The relevant Slovak parties--the Party of the Democratic 
Left 
(SDL), the Democratic Union (DEUS), the Christian Democratic 
Movement (KDH), and the Social Democrats--have already ruled out 
a coalition with Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS). The parties that might support Meciar are not likely to 
receive 5 percent of the vote. Also, the popularity of the HZDS 
leader has declined, Kovac believes. "Up to 93 percent of the 
population used to support him, but now the percentage has 
dropped to 20-30 percent." 
  The Slovaks have gotten used to the coalition government and 
have started appreciating its stabilizing effect and its 
contribution to calming down the political climate. There are 
only a few left who are concerned about the sovereignty of the 
young state. At 4.2 percent, the economy has shrunk to a lesser 
extent than expected. Inflation is "not that high" at 25.1 
percent. 
  Asked about the Slovak nuclear power plants near the 
Austrian 
border, Kovac showed understanding for Austria's concerns, 
stating that his country would also welcome a Central Europe 
free of nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy is not the only 
energy source in Slovakia, but "numerous things do not depend 
only on Slovakia. Bohunice will be closed down in the year 2002. 
Yet Mohovce will continue to operate." 
  Referring to the delicate issue of the Hungarian minority, 
Kovac mentioned the agreements that have been concluded with the 
Hungarian representatives on place-name signs in two languages 
and on the right to bear a name. They do not apply to towns and 
villages that date back to the Magyarization phase between 1876 
and 1918 and to the period between 1939 and 1944. To eliminate 
"insinuations" between Hungary and Slovakia, a treaty on the 
inviolability of the borders is required. Slovakia expects 
positive impulses from Austria's planned entry into the European 
Union. "We hope we will become a neighboring country of the 
European Union." Austria will certainly gather "valuable 
experience" and pass it on to Slovakia, Kovac stressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Economy Minister Peter Magvasi by </F>
Jozef Hubel in Warsaw on 7 May: "We Are Going in the Right 
Direction"] 
  [Text] The Third East-West Conference, attended by 
ministers of economy, industry, and trade of the G-7 and E-10 
countries, ended in Warsaw on 7 May. The aim of the conference 
was to map out the basic elements of economic partnership 
between the two groups of countries, with a view to contributing 
to their permanent economic growth. Our collaborator Jozef 
Hubel, Slovak Television correspondent in Warsaw, asked Minister 
of Economy Peter Magvasi a few questions on this occasion: 
  [Hubel] What conclusions can be drawn from the conference 
for Slovakia? 
  [Magvasi] The main conclusion is that Slovakia is going in 
the right direction and that ours is among the most rapidly 
transforming economies within the framework of the postcommunist 
countries. We could therefore become very interesting as a link 
between the East and the West. 
  [Hubel] We will evidently not make do without foreign 
investment. 
  [Magvasi] Direct foreign investment in the reforming 
countries should reach the sum of $200 billion by the year 2000, 
and the private sector should generate 70 percent of their gross 
national product. The first prerequisite of influx of 
investment resources is the political stability of each country. 
Everything else is a question of the quality, 
conscientiousness, and systemic approach of people, people in 
both the state administration and the entrepreneurial sphere. A 
good atmosphere for that is being created in our country. 
  [Hubel] But we are unlikely to catch up with the 
economically advanced countries by means of foreign capital 
alone. More than that is needed. 
  [Magvasi] An outstretched arm is too little. We must 
ourselves look for ways of catching up with the advanced world. 
Countries relying more on their own resources have progressed 
further than those relying on help from the outside. If the 
appropriate environment is not established, outside help is only 
a single, unrepeated action and has no permanent effect. 
  [Hubel] You have had several bilateral meetings while in 
Warsaw. How would you characterize the present Polish-Slovak 
economic relations? 
  [Magvasi] They can on no account be assessed positively. 
The two countries have a far bigger potential than is indicated 
by the bilateral trade turnover. This is the consequence of a 
certain process, which we no longer have to analyze, however. 
Now we have to focus on opening better corridors for mutual 
trade. A contribution to this should be made by the signing of 
several bilateral agreements during Prime Minister Pawlak's 
visit to Bratislava, which is now under preparation. Until 
then, we should sort out some problems, including, for example, 
the settlement of the Polish debt toward Slovakia. In view of 
its industrial potential, Poland could be a far more significant 
partner for Slovakia than some other countries with which we 
have rich trade relations today.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Imports Exceeded Exports; Slovak Foreign </F>
Trade With European Countries in March"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--Within the framework of foreign 
trade relations with European countries, the Slovak Republic 
exported goods worth 13,587.499 million Slovak korunas [Sk] in 
March 1994 (a total of Sk38,981.804 million for the first three 
months of the year on aggregate) and imported goods worth 
Sk14,052.177 million (Sk42,876,151 for the first three months). 
  The Czech Republic was in first place in terms of the Slovak 
Republic's trade volume with European countries. In March, 
exports to the Czech Republic accounted for 38.58 percent of all 
Slovak exports and 29.41 percent of all Slovak imports. Second 
place is held by Germany, where Slovakia exported 15.76 percent 
of its global exports in March and from which it imported 11.71 
percent of all of its imports. The European country with the 
third-largest trade exchange with Slovakia is Austria; Slovak 
exports to Austria represent 5.40 percent of global Slovak 
exports and 5.90 percent of all Slovak imports. The above 
information was provided by Jaromir Kalincak, director general 
of the Central Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.

  [Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 7 May on page 2 carries a 
350-word TA SR report on the Slovak Republic's foreign trade 
results in the first quarter of the year, which provides data 
also for other European and non-European countries. The report 
reads: ``The Slovak Republic's foreign trade turnover reached 
the value of Sk90.852 billion in the first quarter of the year 
and was 22.4 percent higher than in the same period in 1993. 
This transpires from a Slovak Statistical Office analysis of 
the development of the Slovak Republic's foreign trade in the 
first quarter of the year. 
  ``In the first quarter, the Slovak Republic had a balance of 
trade surplus mainly with the countries of the European Union. 
The surplus amounted to Sk1.642 billion. The Slovak Republic's 
surplus with the FRG alone amounted to Sk2.341 billion and with 
the Netherlands to Sk102 million. The Slovak Republic also 
registered a foreign trade surplus with the countries of the 
Central European Free Trade Association. The surplus with these 
countries amounted to Sk3.929 billion, of which trade with the 
Czech Republic accounted for Sk2.206 billion and trade with 
Hungary for Sk1.821 billion. 
  ``In the first quarter of the year, the Slovak Republic had 
a 
balance of trade deficit, in particular with the countries of 
the European Free Trade Association. The deficit with these 
countries reached Sk1.013 billion, with Austria accounting for 
the biggest part of this deficit--Sk537 million. In its trade 
with Russia in the same period, Slovakia had a deficit of 
Sk8.867 billion and in its trade with Ukraine a deficit of Sk112 
million. 
  ``Compared with the first quarter of 1993, the Slovak 
Republic's exports to the FRG went up 47.8 percent, to Hungary 
40.3 percent, to Austria 22.8 percent, to Italy 73.4 percent, 
and to Poland 16.7 percent. On the other hand, Slovak exports 
to the Czech Republic were 7.3 percent lower than in the first 
quarter of 1993, exports to the Russian Federation declined 0.1 
percent, to Ukraine 38.5 percent, to China 81 percent, to 
Romania 41.9 percent, and to Bulgaria 40.1 percent.'']

  [Text] [Correspondent] The UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] command has shown an interest in dispatching another 400 
of our troops to the former Yugoslavia. How will the Slovak 
side react? 
  [Kanis] Naturally, we have to look at all of the aspects of 
this request. It is necessary to weigh the material and 
financial aspects and also, of course, the possibilities for the 
human resources the Slovak Army has at its disposal. However, 
from the preliminary discussions the members of the delegation 
have had among themselves, it is clear that it would be possible 
to comply with the request--on condition that the UN payments 
would not be delayed, as is the case now, by a year, but would 
be made immediately or, possibly, with a slight delay. In this 
case, we could overcome the problem of this department's tight 
budget.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Latta: "The Engineers Are Earning Us a </F>
Good Reputation"] 
  [Text] A delegation led by Defense Minister Pavol Kanis 
returned home early in the evening of 7 May from its two-day 
official visit to Slovenia and Croatia. Immediately upon his 
return, the minister said that the two visits were completely 
different from the point of view of their contents. 
  The talks in Ljubljana, Slovenia, defined in the dialogue 
between our minister and his departmental counterpart, Jelko 
Kacin, were oriented mainly toward an exchange of views on 
security issues in the Central European region and on the next 
course of action within the framework of the Partnership for 
Peace plan. 
  According to Minister Kanis, the talks with President Milan 
Kucan had a special quality. First and foremost, from the point 
of view of the broad coalition government in Slovenia, which is 
fully functional and, therefore, contradicts the claims by some 
of our politicians about the impossibility of normal activity by 
such a grouping. 
  The Slovak Army commander, Lieutenant General Julius Humaj, 
who was also a member of the delegation, briefed journalists on 
the military aspect of the talks in Slovenia. Among other 
things, he said that he had followed up on the talks he had had 
with General Gucman, chief of the Slovene General Staff, last 
December. 
  Following the division of greater Yugoslavia, Slovenia is at 
the stage of building up its own army and is resolved to expend 
considerable resources on this. In this context, it has asked 
to cooperate with Slovakia, first and foremost, in training 
certain types of troops. For example, our assistance could 
consist of training military pilots or artillery gunners. Humaj 
emphasized, however, that this would require the Slovene Army to 
also have our systems among its armaments so that it could then, 
as the case may be, exercise in our military areas. It is 
simply up to the Slovene side which of our proposals it will 
accept. With regard to the embargo that is still in force, they 
are convinced in Ljubljana that it will come to an end this fall 
and then nothing will stand in the way of even military 
cooperation. The two sides should sign a specific agreement 
during the coming visit of Minister Jelko Kacin, which should 
take place in about a month. 
  The focal point of the visit to Croatia was a visit to the 
Slovak engineering battalion, which is part of the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] forces in Yugoslavia and which, on Saturday, 
was celebrating its first anniversary in the difficult 
conditions of the region of its deployment. According to the 
defense minister, "such activity in UN peacekeeping missions 
should form a significant element of the Slovak Army's future 
activity, and, therefore, it is necessary to strengthen it." 
Kanis also said that very few of Slovakia's citizens are aware 
of the good reputation these soldiers are earning for us and 
that they are also creating a very advantageous and suitable 
basis for Slovak diplomacy in the international arena. "We have 
to overcome the very simplified views held by our citizens about 
the activity of Slovak troops in UNPROFOR services. I think our 
units are doing very well there and that the UNPROFOR command 
also appreciates them," said the defense minister to reporters 
in his assessment of the visit following his return to 
Bratislava.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F>
Ildiko Nagy in Bratislava; date not given; Moravcik speaks in 
Slovak with superimposed translation into Hungarian -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Nagy] The Democratic Union led by Jozef 
Moravcik wants to establish relations with the Hungarian 
Government immediately after the completion of the elections in 
Hungary. [passage omitted] I interviewed the party chairman in 
his capacity as prime minister soon after the results of the 
first round of the Hungarian elections were disclosed. In reply 
to the question of how he assessed Hungary's situation in light 
of the results, Jozef Moravcik said the following: 
  [Moravcik] It was not a big surprise to me, but I am 
reluctant to assess the result of the Hungarian elections. That 
is how the voters decided, and we accept this as a fact. Of 
course, I have the advantage of knowing the views of the two 
parties that came out on top [the Hungarian Socialist Party and 
the Alliance of Free Democrats]. Remembering the discussions I 
recently held with them, I am optimistic. 
  [Nagy] What do you think the first steps of the future 
Hungarian Government will be vis-a-vis the neighbors? And how 
will the Slovak side react to what can be expected to be a 
positive gesture? 
  [Moravcik] If both of the aforementioned party chairmen had 
the opportunity to be in the government, it could be beneficial 
for us to be able to continue the dialogue already under way. 
Then we would have to waste less time on waiting. 
  [Nagy] The Slovak Government has recently made some 
remarkable decisions--for example, on amending the law on the 
use of names or on permitting bilingual placename signs. Have 
any of your Hungarian partners taken notice of this? 
  [Moravcik] I consider it absolutely natural, and there is 
nothing special in this. It complies with our political line 
inasmuch as we promised the Council of Europe that we would 
observe its recommendations. All we are doing now is fulfilling 
this. In my view, we acted in a manner that is entirely 
customary in a democracy when we amended these two laws in a way 
that also satisfies those they concern.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Miklos, deputy chairman of the </F>
Democratic Party, by Maria Hluchanova; place and date not given: 
"The Christian Democratic Movement Proposal Does Not Offer the 
Possibility of Forming a Right-Wing Bloc"] 
  [Text] Representatives of five political parties held 
talks yesterday on the possibility of forming a right-wing bloc 
and on the implementation of the proposal of the Christian 
Democratic Movement [KDH] of so-called open KDH slates of 
candidates. 
  [Hluchanova] Is it the Democratic Party [DS] that hampers 
the implementation of the proposal for right-wing entities to 
participate in the elections on KDH slates of candidates? 
  [Miklos] No. I see a problem in whether there will be 
readiness to seek a better solution than the one proposed by the 
KDH. 
  [Hluchanova] What is your idea of forming a right-wing bloc? 
  [Miklos] The Christian Democrats' proposal does not offer 
the possibility of forming a right-wing bloc. There is to be a 
ticket of a single party and not a common ticket of several 
political entities with similar programs. A common ticket could 
be far more successful from the viewpoint of both maximizing 
electoral gains and minimizing the risk of votes getting lost. 
  [Hluchanova] Are there any differences of opinion between 
you and DS Chairman Pavel Hagyari on this issue? 
  [Miklos] From the viewpoint of our present attitude toward 
the need to seek other possibilities of uniting the right-wing 
parties, our views are identical. However, this does not 
necessarily mean the same standpoint in the event of a final 
decision.

<F P=106> [Article by "TA SR, do": "A Precedent That Is Without </F>
Parallel in the World; Ministry of Culture Demands That the 
Daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA Change Its Name"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--On 28 April 1994, SALUS Ltd. 
registered with the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic a 
daily newspaper called SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA [SLOVAK REPUBLIC], 
states the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic in a 
statement it made available to the TA SR yesterday. 
  The press law, as amended by subsequent regulations, does 
not 
stipulate any restrictions regarding the names of periodicals. 
On the other hand, the name in question is the official name of 
a state that, as transpires from the Constitution of the Slovak 
Republic, must not be used by any other domestic or foreign 
entity. Slovakia is registered under this unique name with the 
United Nations and other international organizations and was 
internationally recognized under this name. In other words, the 
name of the state is protected by international legal 
regulations, and its use by other entities is out of the 
question, also because it could be mistaken for another 
entity--for example, abroad. Speaking about the name of the 
state having been abused is possible on the theoretical plane 
only. In the specific case of the daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, 
such an abuse in the legal sense did not occur. In a letter on 
12 May 1994, the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic, as 
the registering authority, asked the publisher, SALUS Ltd., to 
register a change in the present name of the daily so as to make 
the name of the periodical conform with the Constitution of the 
Slovak Republic and international legal regulations. 
  "Giving a daily or another periodical the name of a state 
can 
be considered a precedent that is without parallel in the 
world," Lubomir Fogos, chairman of the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic Mandate and Immunity Committee, who is one of 
our foremost experts on international and constitutional law, 
said yesterday. In his opinion, the Constitution of the Slovak 
Republic lacks stipulations that would apply to such instances 
of the name of the state being used for commercial purposes. He 
considers it unusual, however, when state symbols, to which the 
name of the Republic undeniably belongs, are used in ways that 
actually debase them. [passage omitted] 
  [Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 13 May on page 2 carries 
a 
100-word "zl"-signed report on a briefing given by the 
Democratic Union on 12 May. According to the report, 
"Democratic Union Deputy Chairman Roman Kovac expressed 
astonishment at the fact that the Ministry of Culture registered 
the daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, which carries the name of the 
state. He said that the government would ask that the 
circumstances under which this happened be reconsidered and that 
it would draw conclusions from this."]

<F P=106> [Article by "ip": "High Price of State Debt; Budget Economy </F>
Reflects State of the Economy"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--On 10 May the Slovak Government 
approved the State Closing Account of the Slovak Republic for 
1993. Although it was expected that the budget deficit would be 
higher than indicated by the treasury balance, the reality is 
even harsher than expected. 
  The deficit indicated by the treasury balance--23 billion 
Slovak korunas [Sk]--must be adjusted to include some items that 
increase it, in fact. This includes, first and foremost, the 
deficit of Sk5.8 billion on the clearing account with the Czech 
Republic, which figures on the revenue side of the state budget 
even though it represents a liability that increases the Slovak 
Republic's debt toward the Czech Republic. Without the impact 
of the clearing account, the deficit would therefore represent 
Sk28.8 billion. Other items that have to be added are uncovered 
debts in health care (Sk1.8 billion) and education (Sk1.2 
billion). The actual budget deficit for last year therefore 
amounts to Sk31.8 billion. 
  Budget revenues fell Sk7.8 billion short of the projected 
sum 
last year. This was mainly the result of lower than expected 
contributions to pension and health insurance and to employment 
[not further specified]. The shortfall was also caused by lower 
than expected tax and customs payments. Tax arrears of Sk12.8 
billion still represent a potential source of state budget 
revenue. A frequent cause of the nonfulfillment of tax 
obligations is that entrepreneurial subjects, the existence of 
which is threatened, prefer the repayment of bank credits to the 
fulfillment of their obligations toward the state budget. 
  Projected budget expenditures were exceeded by Sk15.2 
billion. They increased following the abolition of regulation 
[of budget revenues] in October as a result of problems in 
health services, education, and social security and due to the 
growth of credit interest rates, which influenced payments 
associated with the state debt. Measures to increase state 
budget expenditures (by Sk10.9 billion) and to lower state 
budget expenditures (by Sk4.3 billion) were taken in the course 
of the year. The difference was used mainly in the social 
sphere and health services and to finance the transfer of 
activities from former federal authorities to Slovak authorities. 
  Payments of interest to the Slovak National Bank [NBS] 
amounted to Sk5.6 billion, which is about one-fourth of the 
reported budget deficit. Liabilities toward the NBS arose as a 
result of the current deficit for 1993 and uncovered deficits 
for previous years and as a result of the assumption of the 
former federation's liabilities connected with trade activities 
and with the financing of investment projects abroad. 
  The state of state financial assets and liabilities 
underwent 
a major change as of 1 January 1993. In accordance with the law 
on the division of federal property, the Slovak Republic assumed 
a large-scale bloc of state and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka 
[Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Bank, CSOB] financial assets and 
liabilities (assets of Sk98.6 billion and liabilities of Sk69 
billion). 
  The state debt went up by Sk27 billion in the course of 
1993, 
and the Slovak Republic's aggregate debt reached Sk123 billion 
by the end of the year. 
  The deficit of the state budget for 1993 cannot be covered 
from state financial assets because of their low level of 
liquidity. The government will therefore propose to the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic that the deficit be 
covered by proceeds from the issue of state bonds. 
  [Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak on 11 May on page 2 
carries a 300-word TA SR report on the Slovak Government's 
approval of the state closing account for 1993. The report 
notes that budget revenues reached Sk150.3 billion, Sk7.8 
billion less than projected, and budget expenditures Sk173.3 
billion, Sk15.2 more than projected. The report attributes the 
"disproportion" between budget revenues and budget expenditures 
to "the founding of the independent state, the introduction of a 
new system of taxation, the decline of economic performance, a 
moderate decline of final consumption, inflation growth, and the 
insolvency of entrepreneurial entities."]

  [Excerpts] Interior Minister Imre Konya reacted to the 
statement by Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP], late last night in a press release to MTI. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Konya] I consider these kinds of 
statements as giving rise to great concern. Here in this 
country we have succeeded over the past four years in creating a 
police force that is really free of politics; and now a chairman 
of a political party -- and what is more, a party which, 
together with the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], is 
preparing to govern in coalition -- brings into doubt in a 
public statement the correct behavior, the training, and the 
professionalism of this police force. 
  I think that such statements may be very significant warning 
signs for the future. Such an excessive power is a danger to 
democracy in any case and even more so if the MSZP has a larger 
than two-thirds parliamentary majority. They will be able to do 
what they want and that is not at all reassuring in the light of 
such statements. I hope that in the course of this week the 
police will be able to provide unambiguously proven facts to the 
public. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Is there the slightest 
suspicion 
that it [Horn's road accident] was not an accident? 
  [Konya] No such suspicion exists whatsoever -- apart from 
the 
suspicion raised by Chairman Horn. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the Christian </F>
Democratic People's Party, by Janos A. Szilagyi; place and date 
not given: "I Would Also Accept the Leadership of an Opposition 
Party"] 
  [Text] [Szilagyi] Both the National Committee and the 
Executive Committee of the Christian Democratic People's Party 
[KDNP] have already discussed the political situation that 
emerged after the first round of the elections. How did you 
evaluate the election results? 
  [Surjan] According to the leading bodies of the KDNP, 
despite the modest increase in votes compared with the 1990 
elections, the first round of the current elections was a 
failure for the KDNP. The aforementioned increase in votes was 
not proportional with the organizational development of the 
KDNP. Our party obtained better-than-average results in areas 
where we succeeded in presenting a candidate who won the 
confidence of the voters, a confidence that exceeded the general 
support for our party. 
  [Szilagyi] How do you intend to improve your position in the 
second round? 
  [Surjan] The balance of forces between various parties was 
practically determined by the first round of elections. The 
KDNP suggests that the voters take primarily the candidates' 
professionalism into consideration, but they should not forget 
about the parties that have similar concepts with us either. 
Just like in the case of nominating candidates, local 
organizations decide on support. One thing is certain: There 
will be no written agreement with the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF], like the one signed in 1990, because an agreement on 
mutual withdrawal has already been achieved in the two districts 
where we remained opponents. 
  [Szilagyi] Two days ago, you did not exclude an anti-leftist 
cooperation that would include the Alliance of Free Democrats, 
like an opposition roundtable. 
  [Surjan] Reality shows that the opposition roundtable cannot 
be revived overnight, and there are no possibilities for the 
emergence of a five-party government. The gaps between the 
parties are too deep for this to happen. 
  [Szilagyi] You clearly excluded the possibility of a 
coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] earlier. 
Nor did you consider any cooperation with the SZDSZ as 
possible. In view of your election results so far, has your 
position changed? 
  [Surjan] My answer is a firm no. The MSZP failed to come up 
with a principled declaration regarding the 1956 events, and 
their close contacts with the trade unions also makes our 
cooperation impossible. 
  [Szilagyi] The KDNP Executive Committee postponed the 
detailed analysis of the election results until its next 
meeting. In your view, why did the KDNP fail to obtain the 
expected 12-18 percent of the votes? 
  [Surjan] Many circumstances played a role in our failure. 
In the course of the governing burdens, the KDNP did not assign 
enough time and energy for the reorganization of its internal 
structure. The KDNP failed to operate the flow of information 
adequately within the party, it did not ask the members enough, 
and it failed in making the society aware of the party's 
concepts. We failed to make the people really aware of the 
successes and objective difficulties of the governing activity. 
  [Szilagyi] The Executive Committee decided yesterday on 
convening the National Committee in July to carry out personnel 
changes. Your decision means that your election failure could 
have personnel consequences. What responsibility do you feel 
for your party's election results? 
  [Surjan] Every party leader should think over what he could 
have done better. I do not have to evaluate my four-year 
activity; the relevant body will probably do this in the near 
future. In any case, as required by our statute, I will resign 
and thus give the opportunity for my party to decide whether to 
extend my mandate as party chairman. 
  [Szilagyi] Do you also consider the possibility of leading 
the KDNP as an opposition party? 
  [Surjan] I find an investigation necessary, so that we can 
continue our work calmly. The KDNP is preparing to play the 
role of an opposition party. Social justice and the protection 
of small people should determine our policy in the coming years, 
but we will not make use of any demagogy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Bekesi, economic expert for the </F>
Hungarian Socialist Party, by Laszlo Hajnal; place and date not 
given: "The Central Payments Can Also Be Stopped"] 
  [Text] The new government will first have to make a full 
inventory of the country's situation to find out where we start 
from, Laszlo Bekesi has said. Bekesi, who formulated the 
economic program for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], also 
said that, after the new cabinet comes into office, immediate 
measures will be necessary to stop the further increase of the 
domestic and foreign state debt. Parallel with the quick 
measures, the 1995 budget will have to be prepared, and the so 
far delayed reform of state administration will have to be 
started, which will probably take up all of the next 
parliamentary cycle. 
  [Hajnal] On the night of the elections, MSZP Deputy Chairman 
Imre Szekeres said that the party was preparing a six-month 
action plan in which the most important tasks are laid down. 
Which measures will apply to the economy after the new 
government is formed? 
  [Bekesi] We are indeed preparing a 15-point package, in 
which the most important tasks are laid down: What can be 
implemented or corrected this year, and how to prepare for the 
next year because the draft 1995 budget will also have to be 
prepared by the fall. At the same time, this six-month period 
is deceptive because, in my view, the next government will not 
even have one day's grace, it will have to begin to act straight 
away. 
  First of all, we are making a full inventory of the 
macro-processes because, although we are familiar with the major 
indicators, we do not possess all the information. We must have 
exact information on the country's economic situation and its 
assets, our forint and foreign currency obligations, and the 
central burdens of the ongoing processes -- for example, debtor 
consolidation or privatization. When this inventory is 
completed, then we will have to show it -- our starting point -- 
to the country. In my view, the country's increasing domestic 
and foreign indebtedness is the most dangerous process, we must 
not delay curbing this, and results should be achieved in this 
area still in 1994. 
  [Hajnal] One way of doing this can be the often mentioned 
and inevitable supplementary budget. However, as the 
supplementary budget cannot be accepted before September, its 
effectiveness may be questionable, especially if both the 
expenditure and revenue sides have so far been adhered to 
proportionately with time. 
  [Bekesi] Essentially, we can only consider changing the 
expenditure side, which means the freezing of certain items. I 
am thinking of the 40 decentralized funds that are kind of small 
budgets within the big budget. In my view, out of the funds 
that represent some 100 billion forints' state support, the 
payment of almost all titles can be frozen apart from the money 
given to the agricultural sector, the municipalities, and 
employment. This can mean some 20 to 30 billion forints. In 
addition to this, other state payments can also be stopped, 
mainly the support given to governmental and political organs, 
which can reduce the expenditure side by another 20 billion 
forints. Naturally, these are only estimates, this is precisely 
the reason we have to prepare a correct inventory and situation 
assessment. 
  It is more difficult to change the revenue side; increasing 
taxes is certainly out of the question. However, it is worth 
looking at the 150 billion forints of social security demands; 
according to the experts, some 50 billion of this could be 
moved, however, it is undoubtedly true that many tools, 
including the legal background in certain cases, are lacking for 
the mobilization of these assets. 
  Naturally, it is only worth making a supplementary budget if 
real savings can be achieved through it. 
  [Hajnal] In your previous statements, among the immediate 
tasks, you mentioned the suspension of certain passages of the 
law on cooperatives, a possible stopping of the preferential 
share purchase program [KRP], and the formulation of new asset 
policy principles. What concrete measures were you thinking of, 
especially when the KRP is being offered to ordinary people by 
the current government? 
  [Bekesi] In the case of the cooperatives, we have to prevent 
the remaining assets from being further taken to pieces, this 
has to be stopped immediately. I am convinced that the same 
should be done with the KRP because this method does not mean 
the inclusion of new capital and it does not really create new 
owners. Of course, the KRP can also be amended but the details 
of this still have to be looked at. 
  [Hajnal] In the meantime, the year 1995 also has to be 
prepared. What are the tasks facing legislation? 
  [Bekesi] The majority of tax laws will certainly have to be 
amended, which would mean further tax reductions and tax 
allowances. These would be aimed at stimulating enterprises and 
savings. Further legislative tasks would be: Drawing up the 
foreign currency code and the customs law, amending the local 
authority law, creating export guarantees, and many others. 
  [Hajnal] Implementing the reform of state administration 
would be an urgent task for the new government. How long would 
it take to implement this reform and what are its major points? 
  [Bekesi] In my view, the implementation of the reform would 
take up the whole parliamentary cycle, but it certainly cannot 
be delayed any more. Within this, we have to solve the 
financing of the domestic state debts, on the revenue side it is 
necessary to reexamine the state functions, within this, the 
basic services and the proportions of distribution have to be 
corrected, naturally, linked to compensation, and the 
decentralized funds will also certainly have to be reduced. 
  [Hajnal] In the past, a number of people formulated the 
MSZP's actual economic program. Is this program the one signed 
by you or the one that appeared in an advertisement, perhaps, 
with the influence of trade unions? 
  [Bekesi] I believe that it is the former because the 
MSZP's congress accepted it, and this version appeared in the 
party's election program. Naturally, the way this will appear 
as a coalition government's program will have to be decided in 
negotiations with the partners. 
  [Hajnal] As the person who drew up the MSZP's economic 
program, what role do you envisage for yourself in the new 
government? 
  [Bekesi] It would be far too early to talk about this 
because much depends on the second round of the elections. The 
question is, what kind of government will be formed, what 
members it will have, what kind of program can be drawn up with 
these members, and whether I actually wish to participate in it 
because this is a two-way street.

  [Text] Following the banning of the activities of the 
Hungarist Movement, the operations of the World National 
People's Rule Party [VNP] have also been declared illegal. 
  With its first degree ruling, the Budapest Metropolitan 
Court 
has effectively dissolved the VNP. The court established that 
the activity of the party led by Albert Szabo offends the rights 
of people to live in dignity, which are enshrined in the 
Constitution. It also offends the rights of the individual and 
breaches regulations that determine the rights of association. 
The court's ruling is not absolute.

Brezovaca location on Mt Igman has come under heavy fire from 
the aggressor's positions. It ceased the moment the UN members 
responded accordingly. The chetniks also fired at a UN vehicle 
as it was passing along the Visoko-[word indistinct] road. Fire 
has also been opened at a UN helicopter overflying the (Vele)

<F P=106> [Report by Hajrudin Sermic from Maglaj] </F>
  [Text] This morning the Mt. Ozren chetniks, together with 
their recently arrived reinforcements, intensified their attacks 
on the free Maglaj territory. Fierce artillery fire directed at 
the positions of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade on the northern 
parts of the front, near Bijela Ploca, (Kojundzevaca), and 
Haluge started just after 0700 and went on until midday. Tanks, 
Bofors, and mortars from the infamous strongholds on Mt. Ozren 
fired at the town center. Two people were lightly wounded. 
  The UN Protection Forces in Maglaj again came under attack 
this morning, and the blue helmets were again -- for the second 
day running -- forced to respond to the chetnik fire. This 
time, however, NATO planes appeared very quickly. The Serbian 
aggressor is continuing to concentrate his forces toward Maglaj, 
so new attacks on this part of the free Bosnia-Herzegovina 
territory appear imminent.

  [Excerpt] The Muslim offensive on the Mount Majevica 
battlefield diminished in intensity after Serbian soldiers 
succeeded in repelling several fierce Muslim artillery and 
infantry attacks, regaining areas captured by members of 
Izetbegovic's army in a surprise attack five days ago. Both 
sides suffered considerable losses in manpower in heavy fighting 
-- hand-to-hand in many places -- over the last five days, in 
which all available weapons and heavy artillery were used. 
However, the soldiers of the republic of Srpska army have 
almost completely regained temporarily lost areas and pushed the 
Muslim units back to their initial positions. Muslim forces 
fired more than 300 shells on residential areas during the 
clashes, targeting Priboj and Lopare, said Major-General Novica 
Simic, commander of the eastern Bosnia Corps. Chlorine-charged 
shells were even fired on the primary school in Priboj, Simic 
said, pointing out that Majevica was attacked from all 
directions and that it was the site of fiercest fighting 
currently taking place in the republic of Srpska. [passage

Corps have also marked a success on the Kalesija-Zvornik front. 
In a successful counterattack, the fighters of the 205th and 
the 206th Brigade, together with additional units, have 
liberated the important strategic points Mala Jelica and Velika 
Jelica, while a part of the enemy forces remain surrounded in

in the direction of (Zavrsko Brdo) [word indistinct]. The 
chetnik losses are considerable. Mayor Krste (Medic), commander 
of the 1st Semberija Infantry Brigade, and the chief of staff of 
the same brigade were killed in the fighting. 
  Due to their heavy losses, the chetniks have to carry out 
forceful mobilization of their population. This was reported by 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Press Center.

<F P=106> [Report by the Press Center of the 206th Chivalrous Brigade </F>
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army from the Zvornik front] 
  [Text] Since early morning the aggressor has been pounding 
the entire Zvornik free territory with tanks, howitzer 
batteries, and mortar batteries of all calibers. At the same 
time on the Mt. Majevica section of the front, the aggressor has 
been trying in vain with combined artillery and infantry attacks 
to break through our newly established defense lines. The brave 
fighters of the 206th Chivalrous Brigade of Zvornik, commanded 
by Commander Semsudin Muminovic, have rapidly and effectively 
repulsed a number of infantry attacks by Karadzic's cutthroats, 
defying a maelstrom of shells that has been raining down on them. 
  The chetniks seem incapable of understanding that they have 
suffered a total defeat on the peaks of Mt. Majevica, and are 
constantly launching new infantry attacks, ignoring the bodies 
of dozens of their fellow fighters that will forever remain on 
these peaks.

free territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been expanded by 32 
square kilometers. Sabotaging the plans of chetnik generals 
Milovanovic and Krstic, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters 
smashed the Chetnik offensive and penetrated deep into the 
occupied territory toward Zeravica and Vlasenica. Our units 
have progressed to the line of (Sokoli), [words indistinct], and 
(Bijela Stijena). All attempts by the Chetniks to recapture the 
lost territory have been in vain. 
  Over 100 chetniks were killed in this fighting, 20 of whom 
were [word indistinct], and the number of the wounded is several 
times higher. The result of this operation is two tanks, two 
mobile antiaircraft weapons, two 105-mm howitzers, and one 
antiaircraft gun destroyed. The chetnik units in this region 
have been completely smashed, and the volunteers from Serbia are 
fleeing to where they came from in the first place.

  [Excerpts] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 16 (AFP) -- Two 
heavy artillery shells hit a residential area of the mainly 
Moslem industrial town of Tuzla on Monday [16 May], causing 
panic as residents fled the streets, witnesses said. [passage 
omitted] The shells crashed in mid-afternoon not far from the 
town's hotel, which had been hit Sunday night by a large-calibre 
shell, and left two craters in a children's play area. 
Residents of the town immediately fled the streets, bathed in 
early summer sunshine, to take shelter, dragging their children 
away from play. No injuries were reported. It was the third 
day in succession the northeastern Bosnian town had been 
shelled, apparently from Serb positions some four kilometres 
(2.5 miles) to the north east. Last Wednesday two people were 
killed and four injured in two waves of shelling, prompting 
local authorities to close schools. A decision was to be made 
later Monday on when to reopen them. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] After a tour of Mostar today, General Michael 
Rose, the commander of the peacekeeping forces for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, said he was dissatisfied with what had been 
done to enable the civilians to cross freely from one part of 
town to the other. It is easier for civilians to cross from one 
part of Sarajevo to the other than from the eastern to the 
western part of Mostar and vice versa, Rose said, adding that 
the freedom to cross from one part of Mostar to the other was 
like the freedom to cross from East to West Berlin during the 
Cold War. In his talks with representatives of civilian and 
military authorities of the western part of Mostar, he said that 
much more had been done in central Bosnia to implement the 
Washington agreement, and in particular to provide free movement 
of civilians. 
  Representatives of authorities of western Mostar said it was 
better to normalize life in Mostar slowly but surely, than hurry 
and make quite possible mistakes, which could reverse the peace 
process back to the starting point. What has been done so far 
to completely end the fighting is a lot for Mostar, 
representatives of Croatian authorities said, adding that the 
latest Croat-Bosniak political agreements would certainly 
stimulate the normalization of life in Mostar. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina </F>
Presidency, by Senka Kurtovic; place and date not given: 
"Embargo on Life"] 
  [Text] We began the interview with Ejup Ganic, member of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, by asking him about politics. 
  [Ganic] They say that politics is mostly the sport of older 
people. They have the experience, they are realistic and 
patient enough. Younger politicians are good for winning 
battles, duels. Take the politics of the United States, its 
foreign policy in particular. You will see that it was mostly 
older politicians who made wise moves. Small countries need 
that kind of wisdom even more. 
  [Kurtovic] Did we have enough of that wisdom? 
  [Ganic] It was very difficult to have any kind of politics 
at the beginning of the war, when there was almost no Bosnian 
politics to speak of. Only the Bosniaks had some kind of 
program that reflected the moves of that politics. There was 
quite a lot of Yugoslav politics. One year before the war broke 
out, we abounded in ideas about how to preserve Yugoslavia. 
However, other republics did not even dream about that. We 
were trying to formulate some ideas about preserving Yugoslavia. 
Milosevic wanted to turn Yugoslavia into some kind of greater 
Serbia, we know what others wanted.... Later on, however, that 
politics boiled down to defending the country, the Bosniaks were 
trying to expand at the political scene. It is too early to say 
whether they succeeded in that. However, some people in this 
country are too selfish. They went away, kept aside, and looked 
after their own interests. 
  [Kurtovic] You have recently returned from the United 
States. Considering their concessions at a time crucial for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, do you think that the United States has two 
kinds of politics for Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ganic] President Clinton and Vice President Gore are young 
people dealing with a serious challenge for the first time. It 
was by design that Bush would not do anything for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He had a relatively good rating owing to the 
successfully-ended Gulf crisis and Bosnia-Herzegovina was just 
another unnecessary risk for him. It is still not too late for 
Clinton, but that confirms my thesis that politics should be 
managed by older people. More experienced people would know 
that fascism and aggression cannot be stopped on a voluntary 
basis. There is not a single case in the history of 
international diplomacy of an aggressor willingly giving up its 
military advantage in negotiations. Speaking about just peace 
-- and we are faced with a mighty military machinery of our 
aggressor and with an arms embargo against us -- we cannot 
expect a just peace. Older (wiser) politicians would solve this 
problem immediately. In my opinion, the politics of the United 
States is not ambiguous but undetermined, which is again typical 
of young politicians. There is one thing, however, that is good 
for the United States: dodging, in the sense that Bosnia is a 
European problem and must be solved by Europe. They had two 
years to eliminate the problem and did nothing, so now we will 
get involved. Therefore, the United States is provided with an 
argument in favor of more active involvement.... 
  [Kurtovic] What is really the goal of that indecisive 
politics? 
  [Ganic] Vice President Gore told me that the politics of the 
United States is designed to bring peace to Bosnia, peace that 
has to be acceptable to the legal authorities. I agree with 
that, but we want a peace that will be a just solution for us. 
In my opinion, the involvement of the United States is much 
greater now. 
  [Kurtovic] What prompted the more active involvement? 
  [Ganic] My impression is that Gorazde was the turning point, 
for the 720 people who were killed there indirectly saved other 
enclaves. The United States knows that Karadzic's and 
Milosevic's Serbs (for I cannot blame the entire nation) lie and 
that they will try to outwit 30 to 50 percent of the ultimatums. 
The problem is that the European leaders are dwarfs, 
historically speaking. 
  [Kurtovic] What about the United Nations, what is its role? 
  [Ganic] The United Nations organization is lead by people 
who have no experience in political management and no refined 
sense for human rights and liberties. I told Butrus-Ghali he 
reminds me of a manager who has ruined a company. I told him he 
was responsible for Gorazde, that the catastrophe happened - - 
because of his lack of determination and because he had 
destroyed all the mechanisms -- not only for Bosnia, but for all 
small countries that counted on the so called UN shield. 
Butrus-Ghali told me he could do nothing. We talked for about 
an hour and a half and I think the conversation will stick in 
the memories of both of us as very unpleasant. Rumor has it 
that the United States is hiding behind the UN, behind 
Butrus-Ghali, who runs a house that is not functioning. The 
United States says it is in favor of lifting the embargo, but 
the United Naitons, i.e. Russia, can impose a veto. 
  [Kurtovic] What are, actually, U.S. and Russian views about 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ganic] I think that their views are alike regarding Bosnia, 
in the sense that they both agree about the integrity of the 
country. There is, however, an underlying Russian variant - - 
the Serbs should be given a large part and the Bosniaks have 
already made an agreement with the Croats and they will get the 
rest. However, that still presents a division. Our agreement 
with the Croats is extremely important and it is in the 
interests of both sides. I told the Americans that the 
constitution they wrote for us is of extreme importance, 
especially if it is applied on the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina 
territory. Together with the Russians, the United States must 
put pressure on the Belgrade regime to accept it. 
  [Kurtovic] Akashi also advocates the policy of compromise. 
In your opinion, is he a representative of Japanese politics or 
just a "player" for key countries in the UN? 
  [Ganic] I do not think he is a particular representative of 
Japanese politics. Akashi made some big mistakes and his 
responsibility is documented. He prevented air strikes on 
positions from which the Serbs were shelling Gorazde for an 
entire day during the ultimatum. At least 28 people were killed 
and more than a hundred were wounded. That is direct 
responsibility and Akashi could have prevented it. He himself 
did a lot to discredit his political career. Even in his own 
country. He is directly responsible, for people were killed as 
a result of his non-action. 
  [Kurtovic] What is the influence of the Islamic countries on 
the United Nations and the United States? 
  [Ganic] Perhaps we help Islamic countries more then they 
help us. Our problem seems to have united them for the first 
time. Before, each of them had their own views. They were not 
homogenous enough, not unanimous. They can help us rebuild the 
country, the market, create jobs, and in establishing good 
relations, which is very important. If Islamic countries were 
more homogenous, they could jeopardize the national interest of 
the West and dictate the solution for Bosnia to a large extent. 
Generally speaking, that is a very slow mechanism. They seem 
to be more and more involved. 
  [Kurtovic] Could the Islamic countries have used an oil 
embargo to force the West to act more decisively? 
  [Ganic] That embargo would be most harmful for the United 
States and Japan. However, these are major decisions, and they 
are not prepared to make them, at least for the time being. 
They built a nice unity on the tragedy of Bosnia. Many Islamic 
countries were not even aware that there are Bosniaks-Muslims 
living in Bosnia. 
  [Kurtovic] Who is the main obstacle to lifting the arms 
embargo in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ganic] It is probably not very likely that the embargo will 
be lifted in its entirety in the near future. When I was in the 
United States, I made it clear that we want limited quantities 
of defensive weapons. We do not demand tanks but antitank 
shells, we do not demand airplanes, helicopters, just guns. We 
do not want to win this war but to survive. We cannot use the 
word victory, for we have already been defeated by the 
international community. Their view on human rights does not 
allow us to talk about victory. We discovered darkness and we 
were hoping to wake up to the light. In a nutshell, if you are 
intent on having names, Britain is most opposed to lifting the 
embargo. It is the mouthpiece of such ideas. We know about the 
Russians, however. There are solutions that would force them to 
make some concessions. If we only had at least one antitank 
shell for every tank that attacked us, we would have stopped the 
war. However, they did not let us defend ourselves. They 
deprived us of the right to defend ourselves. 
  [Kurtovic] Lately, on the occasion of the events in 
Gorazde, we have often heard the public blaming generals of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. What do you think about that? 
  [Ganic] In every group of people of the same profession, 
just a few meet the essential criteria. We say: there are all 
kinds of weeds in God's garden. Our generals also range from 
bad to the best. The process of forming the army was a 
painstaking one and we must occasionally make some personnel 
changes, especially among its leadership, in order to create 
competition. One must not forget that we are still at war 
against an army with a very developed logistics, weapons, 
positions, an army of more than 50 years in the making. 
Naturally, every criticism is welcome, but it should not be 
destructive, it should only serve as a warning for the future. 
That became a topic which should be reduced to some reasonable 
limits. There are many unknown heroes and we must remember that. 
This should teach the generals a lesson in what people 
understand best. Be where the action is -- that is a message, 
not a topic for discussion. 
  [Kurtovic] We more often hear that minor fighting for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina creates major fighting for power. Can you 
comment on that? 
  [Ganic] With a few honorable exceptions, Bosnia is defended 
by poor people. And there are two kinds of authority in Bosnia 
-- those who were elected and those who joined them during the 
war. Whether we want it or not, we will be forced to send some 
people back. That will create a much stronger competition. 
Perhaps that is why some want to seize power today, for it will 
be more difficult to do it tomorrow. This will be a complex 
country. We more or less know, even now, what and how much one 
can do. However, our people are much smarter and we all 
understand what happened in this war. When the time comes, when 
those who are less courageous and more competent come, we will 
welcome them. 
  [Kurtovic] You were recently appointed vice president of the 
SDA [Party of Democratic Action]. Since when have you been a 
member? 
  [Ganic] I thought you knew that those two dates overlap 
(laughter). But there is more to this. I was overcome by the 
desire to help the Bosniaks as much as I can. According to a 
theory of my predecessors, the Ganics like many other Bosniak 
families were expelled from Bosnia. The circle is now complete 
-- now I return to Bosnia and my son will be born here. These 
are difficult times for the Bosniaks. They were abandoned by 
many, but the Bosniaks proved to be noble gentlemen. I felt I 
had political followers and the SDA leadership sometimes asked 
for my advice and opinion. I built my political views. 
However, I had offers from other political parties, perhaps for 
even better positions. I decided to join the SDA, for I think 
that my presence can make it a stronger party, not so much now, 
as after the war. Now most people are fighting on the front 
lines. On the other hand, we will have a different political 
system and all activities will go through parties. All those 
reasons influenced this decision of mine. 
<H5>  [Box, p 4] </H5>
<H5>  Even With the Serbs </H5>
  A federation is a quite decentralized state. It will even 
allow the Serbs to be on their own. They can have a Serb flag 
in every room. And let them have it. But we will not let them 
divide the country and take what does not belong to them. We 
were asked whether we could live with the Serbs. We will live 
together in some areas, somewhere as neighbors, somewhere under 
the surveillance of the international community on the basis of 
some rights. Serb fascism, as did other fascisms, will come to 
an end. 
<H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Helicopter and Morality </H5>
  One UN soldier was wounded in Gorazde and he was picked up 
by 
a helicopter around which hundreds of mothers carrying 
blood-covered, wounded children gathered. They begged to get 
their children in the helicopter, for that was the only possible 
help. No! The helicopter was sent out to pick up only that 
soldier. The United Nations was unrelenting. You all heard the 
mayor of Gorazde, Ismet Briga, who begged NATO to bomb the 
inhabitants of Gorazde to end their suffering. That is the 
result of the embargo and of the moral quality of that action.

<F P=106> [Interview with Biljana Plavsic, vice president of the </F>
republic of Srpska, by Branka Andjelkovic in Belgrade; date not 
given: "Woman in the Middle of the Road"] 
  [Text] For some people she is "the Serbian empress," for 
others "the biggest mistake the Serbian leadership has ever 
made." Biljana Plavsic, vice president of the republic of 
Srpska, does not want to give up radicalism. "We are not in a 
position to make compromises," she says. "If people's vital 
interests are at stake, my attitudes are not radical in the 
negative sense of the word." Mrs. Plavsic has no intention of 
withdrawing many of her statements, which in the Serbian 
Republic are often considered negative, because -- as she says 
-- the problem lies "only in their interpretation." We talked 
with Mrs. Plavsic in her office in the "Bosanka" residence. 
  [Andjelkovic] In the view of many people the crisis around 
Gorazde and the NATO involvement marked the beginning of a new 
attitude of the West toward the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. How 
would you assess the new political situation as far as the 
Serbian side is concerned? 
  [Plavsic] If Serbs are not obedient there will be 
bombardments again. This will happen if we do not do what they 
want, according to Western criteria. We were told this very 
clearly by the latest ultimatum. Since we agreed with these 
rules of the game by agreeing to withdraw our weapons from the 
Sarajevo front it is too late now. The West explained the 
attack on Gorazde with the fact that Gorazde was a safe haven, 
but this is senseless, because the United Nations has not done 
anything to protect the safe havens in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They 
were not demilitarized, the Muslim army was supplied with 
weapons without any control, the UN Protection Force even helped 
them. This means that the West did not have any justification 
for that attack. If there is any new ultimatum for other 
unprotected areas, we should refuse all compromises. 
  [Andjelkovic] Do you believe NATO will get involved in 
events 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the future, too? 
  [Plavsic] This time it looked like the United States had not 
made a mistake by not giving in to 1,300,000 Serbs in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We really gave them a chance to show to 
their people that their threats were effective. If they 
continue to use threats for protected and unprotected areas, it 
is quite clear what should happen. It has been clear for a long 
time already what should be done, but there are people who do 
not seem to know this. We shall certainly be bombed, sooner or 
later. The West does not know, however, that the Serbian people 
in the war regions are already completely resistant to threats. 
They do not respond to them any longer, and when you ask them 
about bombardments, the only thing they say is: "They should 
start at last, let them drop these bombs!" A threat that is 
repeated again and again loses its impact with time. I can say 
only one thing: They do not know the mentality of the Serbian 
people at all. The Serbs cannot be scared. 
  [Andjelkovic] Was the action in Gorazde necessary, however? 
Do you not think that the negotiating process would be different 
had there been no Gorazde crisis? 
  [Plavsic] It was Gorazde's turn after Sarajevo. Had there 
been no crisis in Gorazde, there would have been something else, 
we can expect continuous pressure. The West has now asked for a 
four-month cease-fire. Let me remind you that [Bosnian 
President] Alija Izetbegovic asked for the same thing before, 
and you know why. He wants to strengthen his army in these four 
months, he does not need these four months in order to reach 
peace. Anyway, let us assume that they need four months to 
carry out political negotiations, to reach some kind of peace, 
some kind of agreement. If we show resistance during these 
negotiations, they will use threats again, but we must not 
respond to them. We shall certainly find ourselves in the 
situation in which we shall simply have to do our job, no matter 
what kind of threats they make. 
  [Andjelkovic] Where is this leading to? 
  [Plavsic] Nobody wants to realize that there is a war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is a very special war, but it is still 
a war. There is the attacking warring faction and the other 
which defends itself, and I want to repeat that we were attacked 
by the Croatian-Muslim coalition. Our lives, the existence of 
our people were at stake. In every war there must be one party 
that loses and one that wins. Whenever it is said that it must 
not be mentioned that somebody has won this war, this goes 
beyond common sense. How can an army be stimulated to defend 
itself if it is forbidden to win. There is no logic in it! 
  [Andjelkovic] If NATO becomes involved in the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, it could easily happen that the Serbs lose 
according to the war theory you have just explained to me. 
  [Plavsic] It is very difficult to make predictions. If we 
are isolated, it does not mean that we have to lose. I think 
that Vietnam was a big loss for the United States, and this is 
not the only example. We have always known why we are fighting, 
we have always defended ourselves, we have always seemed to be 
in somebody's way, as if we had built a house in the middle of 
the road. You fight in a completely different way if you know 
that you will not exist unless you defend yourself. This is the 
best possible motive. Apart from that, there is a great sense 
of responsibility in the United States for every human life lost 
without good reason. If 10 U.S. soldiers had lost their lives 
in our territory, Clinton would be endangered, especially 
because he is already under pressure because of the latest 
scandal in the United States. 
  [Andjelkovic] What is the present attitude of the republic 
of Srpska's leadership -- does it support war or peace? 
  [Plavsic] Since the London conference we have been searching 
for a solution to achieve peace. We want to achieve peace, but 
not at any price. We do not want peace if it means that we have 
to give up territory, we do not want peace if the dignity of the 
Serbian people is lost, we cannot do this. Peace can only be 
achieved if the three sides sit down at the negotiating table 
and start negotiating. It cannot be negotiated, however, as 
long as there is no peace. 
  [Andjelkovic] What is your attitude then? 
  [Plavsic] Peace, peace, and peace! We are offering peace, 
which should be followed by negotiations. 
  [Andjelkovic] Do not you think that because of Gorazde you 
are farther away from peace now than before? 
  [Plavsic] I do not think we have lost anything. We even won 
something at Gorazde. Our civilian population that fled in 
August 1992 are now returning to their homes in Gorazde. The 
United Nations said that the Serbian army had to withdraw to a 
3-km ring around Gorazde, so that civilians are protected now. 
If they protect the Muslims, they have to protect the Serbs, 
too. Whatever is good for these people who returned to their 
homes in Gorazde, since Gorazde belongs to them, is good for us, 
too. This makes us hope that peace can be achieved. 
  [Andjelkovic] Yes, but without Russian help, it seems. What 
was the reason for [Russian envoy Vitaliy] Churkin's sharp words 
to the Serbs? Is it perhaps your statement that the reason for 
such a large number of Serbian planes in the air was an air show? 
  [Plavsic] I am afraid that I shall be too severe as far as 
Churkin is concerned. It has been clear to me since the very 
beginning that Churkin is a man who has only one task, which was 
assigned to him not by Russia, but probably by the United 
States. We have been very cautious toward Churkin from the 
beginning, and it is good that the Serbs have not given him 
their confidence. We have learned in this war that there no are 
historical friendships, as for example with France or Russia, 
there are only interests. The present Russian politics is 
directly linked to the money Russia recently got from the West. 
If this sum is distributed to the Russian population, it means 
that every Russian citizen got $5. It is horrible to lose the 
dignity of the largest Slavic state and people for only $5! 
Such things happen, though. The Serbs are the strongest when 
they are alone, and now we are really alone. 
  Yuliy Vorontsov [Russian permanent representative to the 
United Nations] had been very firm in his attitude that the 
Serbs should not be bombarded, but after Russia received 
financial help he said that the NATO ultimatum could be used as 
a threat to the Serbs. There is no reason why Churkin should 
say that the Serbs lie, that they say one thing today, and 
another tomorrow. We are shocked and astonished! It is clear 
that a politician can be shrewd and use even lies. Every 
politician acts like that. [Secretary of State Warren] 
Christopher says one thing in the morning, and a completely 
different thing in the evening. Why does Churkin blame us even 
if what he said is true? If you take a look at the political 
line drawn by Serbian politicians, you can say that it is very 
consistent and clear. How could we deceive Mr. Churkin that 
much in one night and two days he spent with us? As if he were 
a saint and can therefore be shocked! All this is very 
transparent. 
  [Andjelkovic] Were there differences during the latest 
meeting between [UN special envoy] Akashi, [Serbian President] 
Milosevic and [republic of Srpska president] Karadzic regarding 
the relations between the Serbian president and the president of 
the republic of Srspka? 
  [Plavsic] I do not think that there were any differences in 
the basic attitude. There have been permanent consultations 
between the leadership of the republic of Srpska and the Serbian 
leadership, but no decisions have been taken. I would like to 
point out that it is only the republic of Srpska that can 
decide. The Jahorina assembly proved the same thing when the 
Vance-Owen plan had to be decided on. Consultations had 
preceded it, but the final decision was taken by parliament, or 
better said, in a referendum. It was opposite to the attitude 
of the Serbian leadership. 
  [Andjelkovic] There are rumors about your disagreement with 
Milosevic? 
  [Plavsic] It is clear that my attitudes, which are purely 
Serbian national attitudes, cannot comply with Milosevic's 
attitudes. He has one pedigree, I have a different one. I can 
listen to his arguments, I communicate well with people who have 
a different opinion from mine, but it seems that others cannot 
communicate with me because I have a different opinion. I 
disagreed with the previous regime, the biggest problem was that 
you had to think in the same way as everybody else. That regime 
deprived the people of the possibility to express their opinion 
openly. Somebody who supported things like that must be 
completely different from me. Therefore I cannot think like Mr. 
Milosevic. He is Milosevic, and I am Biljana Plavsic. It was 
really a low blow by Milosevic to manipulate my quotation of a 
statement a wounded soldier made in connection with the 
Vance-Owen plan in the following way: "There are 12 million 
Serbs, if 6 million die, the other 6 million will live 
honestly." It is a shame to manipulate a statement like that. 
And who is the person who manipulated it!? A president of a 
state. I really do not know what his interests were. 
  [Andjelkovic] There have been rumors recently that 
President Milosevic could betray the Bosnian Serbs. What do you 
think about it? 
  [Plavsic] As far as the Serbian national interest is 
concerned, I do not trust anybody. People have to be asked what 
they want. Somebody who does not respect parliament and thinks 
that it is something unimportant.... As far as the vital 
interests of a nation are concerned, the people who got the 
mandate have to be controlled all the time because we have 
already had bad experiences. It is easier for them, too, to 
share responsibility with parliament and with their people. The 
referendum is an institution recognized throughout the world. 
The world recognized the results of the referendum on the 
Vance-Owen plan. 
  [NIN] Why have you never been a member of Karadzic's team in 
international meetings? You have been elected to your duty by 
the parliament of the republic of Srpska. 
  [Plavsic] Ask Mr. Karadzic and not me! 
  [NIN] Do you often visit soldiers on the front? 
  [Plavsic] The whole of our territory is practically a front. 
Everybody participates in it; my function requires me to have 
direct contacts with the people. This enables me to know 
exactly what our soldiers and what the wounded think. I was 
told by the soldiers on the Gorazde front some time ago that 
they were happy to see me participate in the negotiations. They 
said that they knew that it would not come to any compromises 
that would harm the Serbs. I have to tell you that I am happy 
that soldiers have such a good opinion about me. 
  [NIN] Are you elegant at the front, too? 
  [Plavsic] I could go to the front right away, I have a pair 
of sports shoes here so that I can go anywhere. 
  [Andjelkovic] There has been much speculation about your 
suitors, among whom Prince Tomislav Karadjordjevic has been 
mentioned, too? 
  [Plavsic] Regarding my link with Prince Tomislav, you as 
well as all others must surely know that I am a monarchist and I 
believe that everything that can bring the Serbs, who are 
otherwise prone to divisions, together should be very much 
cherished. Personally, I believe that a monarchy is one of 
those factors that could preserve the unity of the Serbian 
people. We are facing a man who belongs to a monarchy that has 
never, not for a single moment, harmed the Serbian people nor 
has it threatened the dignity of the Serbs and I respect them 
all very much. By meeting with Prince Tomislav, who is a son of 
Aleksandar and a grandson of Petar I, and by expressing my 
respect toward him, I am in a way paying respect to his 
ancestors. 
  [Andjelkovic] However, you are often seen together. At the 
congress of the Serbian intellectuals you sat next to each other. 
  [Plavsic] What else could I have done when the organizers 
asked me -- "where will you sit, of course, next to Prince 
Tomislav I am sure" -- and then I sat next to him. Most 
probably we share similar views on this entire situation. 
  [Andjelkovic] Therefore, you reject the insinuations that 
there is something more than friendship between you? 
  [Plavsic] Well, out of the question! I must tell you 
immediately that not even friendship, to tell you honestly. 
Above all, just as none of you would know my age, it is normal 
that at my age there is no interest in anything of the kind. I 
only have to carry out this duty of mine, to live to see the 
Serbian state, and then I will end the political career in which 
I have ended up as a result of circumstances. 
  [Andjelkovic] You are well-known for your radical views. 
Your statement about "the Muslims who are disturbing you" in 
eastern Bosnia has provoked a considerable reaction at a given 
moment. 
  [Plavsic] That Markovic woman [wife of Serbian President 
Milosevic] used this immediately. She is very capable of 
manipulating one-sidedly and interpreting other peoples' words 
in her own way. I do not know what sort of an ambition people 
have to simply tear what people say out of the context and then 
interpret these words in their own way. I call such people 
malicious people. I always try to find something positive, even 
when it involves such persons, and I always concentrate on this, 
while she is specifically looking for something bad. I would 
have been awfully unhappy had I been like this. However, I am 
quick to forget unpleasant things and even though many have 
aspirations to cause me harm I bear no ill will against them. 
  [Andjelkovic] Beside this, there have been numerous negative 
assessments of your statements and moves in the public? 
  [Plavsic] If these people with bad intentions knew how 
nothing can hurt me I think they would stop attacking me. But 
they truly dislike me. I can be terribly hurt when someone of 
whom I have a good opinion does something to hurt me. However, 
I resolve this very quickly, I contact the person and clarify 
the matter immediately. This is how I resolve my problems. I 
do not turn to the past at all, and I also pass quickly over 
certain things that other people would not. I simply do not 
want to burden myself with this. Precisely because of this I 
believe that from this point of view I live a very comfortable 
life.

<F P=106> [Report by M. L.: "The Most Important Thing -- End of the </F>
War"] 
  [Text] The European plan for an approach to solving the 
crisis in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is better and more 
realistic than the United States' plan and it is good that it 
prevailed at the meeting in Geneva. Of course, there are bound 
to be problems, but they can be solved. The most important 
thing is that this plan envisages the cessation of hostilities, 
which means the continuation of the peace talks, Nikola 
Koljevic, vice president of the Serbian republic, told Radio 
Kragujevac yesterday. Commenting on the declaration of the 
ministerial council in Geneva, and the proposed division of 
territory -- 49 percent for the Serbs, 51 percent for the 
Muslims and Croats -- he said that the Serbian side was ready to 
correct the borders if functional entities are created, that is, 
if the quality and quantity of territory are treated equally.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 16 (TANJUG) -- A delegation of the 
Serb republic (S.R.) in the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina met on Monday with an official of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for Bosnia, 
Andreas Kun, to discuss an exchange of prisoners and the 
stepping up of the ICRC activities in Pale, the administrative 
centre of the S.R. Bosnian Serb Vice-President Nikola Koljevic, 
who headed the delegation, said to reporters that the issue had 
been discussed into detail, with a very concrete plan and lists 
of names. 
  `We believe that talks on this subject are highly important 
because they will be the first indication in the next few days 
of whether an agreement on ending hostilities will be signed or 
not,' said Koljevic. 
  The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and the 
European Union [EU] on Friday called the warring sides in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to sign a four-month truce which would give 
them an opportunity to reach agreement on a territorial division 
of Bosnia on the basis of the E.U. formula granting 51 percent 
of the Bosnian territory to the Moslems and Croats, and 49 to 
the Serbs. 
  The ICRC official said after the meeting that he expected 
Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation on one side and the Bosnian 
Serbs on the other to show good will in connection with an 
agreement on the exchange of prisoners. He insisted that visits 
to prisoners should continue as well as the inspection of 
condition in which they are held. 
  Health Minister Dragan Kalinic, who also attended the 
meeting, said that the Serb side had insisted on getting 
information about hundreds of Serb prisoners who have been held 
captive in a silo in the Moslem village of Tarcin in central 
Bosnia for more than a year. The talks also tackled the 
question of 16 Serb doctors and medical staff in Sarajevo who 
were last autumn prevented from being evacuated from the city 
and whom the Moslem authorities arrested and sentenced to two 
years in prison because of their alleged refusal to comply with 
the work obligation, Kalinic said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic by </F>
Amir Hodzic in Geneva; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Hodzic] Mr. Granic, how would you assess the 
agreement between the Bosniak and the Croatian sides in Vienna? 
  [Granic] Very positively. I believe that this is a key step 
in the implementation of the Washington Agreement, that is, it 
is a key step [words indistinct] federation [word indistinct] 
the Croats on (a fair basis), which will be [word indistinct], 
and which will be to the mutual interest of both the Bosniaks 
and the Croats, and the other citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Of course, we want this to be a firm federation that will be in 
a confederal relationship with the Republic of Croatia, and 
again to mutual benefit and interests. There can be no [words 
indistinct] confederation, mutual interests. We talked about 
this a lot, and [word indistinct] the talks with certain 
agreements [word indistinct]. The primary problem is the 
problem of the humanitarian convoys, the problem of energy 
facilities, transportation, refugees, and so on. Of course, 
this [words indistinct] through better cooperation. 
  [Hodzic] Do you believe that what has been agreed in Vienna 
will be successfully implemented on the ground? 
  [Granic] Well, I am an optimist. Both sides have to make 
maximum efforts. There will be individual resistance to the 
agreement, and one has to expect that, but if [words indistinct] 
then the agreement will be implemented. 
  [Hodzic] How much does the ministerial meeting in Geneva 
respect the agreement from Vienna? 
  [Granic] Well, in any case it is not against the Vienna 
agreement, and it is primarily directed at the third side, that 
is, how to get the Serbs to the negotiating table, how to 
achieve a cease-fire, and how to implement the agreement. As 
for the main part of it, that is, the territories, [word 
indistinct], and so on, [word indistinct] is the negotiating 
position. I heard today that [Bosnian Serb official Momcilo] 
Krajisnik has said that even 51 percent for the federation is 
too much. That is their negotiating position. The 
international community has presented its negotiating position. 
  [Hodzic] How would you comment on what the ministers here 
agreed on as far as the solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
situation is concerned? 
  [Granic] I think it is all right in principle, which means 
that a (contact) group has been formed to monitor the cease-fire 
and the negotiations, and that is what Croatia supports. 
  [Hodzic] Mr. Granic, thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Bernhard Lichte] </F>
  [Excerpts] Croatia is burning -- Serbian conquerors on the 
march: Vukovar in October 1991; pictures that went around the 
world. Soldiers had given vent to their fury. The results were 
mass murders, destruction, and deportation. Vukovar is a 
synonym for incredible human suffering. The streams of refugees 
are witnesses and victims of innumerable crimes against humanity. 
  Tomislav Mercep at that time was responsible for Vukovar. He 
had been brought to power during the confusions of the founding 
of the independent state. Today he is an adviser to the 
Croatian interior minister. 
  A confidential letter to President Tudjman states that 
Tomislav Mercep was responsible for attacks on private 
apartments, looting, torture during interrogations, and even 
executions. The person who wrote this in August 1991 is the 
Croatian Government's representative in Vukovar. Who is this 
Tomislav Mercep? The construction engineer first drew attention 
to himself with his militant speeches. Anyone who does not want 
to live in the Croatian homeland can look for a new one 
tomorrow, he grandly stated in the election campaign in 1990, 
addressing the Serbian population in eastern Slavonia. Croatia, 
Croatia, the enthusiastic crowd chanted. 
  One year later, Mercep formed the first unit of volunteers 
at 
the order of Tudjman's party, the Croatian Democratic Community 
[HDZ]. In Bogdanovci, a small village near Vukovar, he gathers 
2,000 men around him, whom he swears to the common cause. It is 
10 March 1991, the state of Yugoslavia still exists. The 
gathering is secret and illegal. Mercep announces that certain 
equipment is available and will be distributed soon. Then the 
territorial defense forces have to learn how to use them. 
Everyone here understands what he means. The arming of the 
secessionists begins. 
  Months later it is primarily Mercep's volunteers who fight 
against the Yugoslav People's Army and are equipped with the 
powers of a special police force. Subsequently, more and more 
excesses are committed, for example in Gospic. The masters 
changed several times in the town at the front line. Serbian 
troops in December 1991 discover 24 bodies in the orthodox 
cemetery -- executed, hardly buried, some of them charred. It 
turns out that most of them are Serbs. However, the Croatian 
public prosecutor of Gospic is also among the victims -- a 
declared opponent to Tudjman's regime. Only Tomislav Mercep's 
special units can be the killers. Some of them later boasted 
that they had killed 150 Serbian snipers in Gospic -- this is 
hardly possible without the knowledge and support of their 
commander. 
  The Zagreb mass-circulation paper GLOBUS publicized several 
other cases. Mercep's death squadrons, the paper's headline 
stated, had killed a Serbian family in Zagreb and arbitrarily 
shot people in Pakracka Poljana. UN investigators did find 19 
bodies there. 
  Asked about the accusations, Mercep denies any guilt. But he 
says: 
  [Begin Mercep recording, in Serbo-Croatian with superimposed 
German translation] What are 19 dead Serbs compared with what 
was done to Croats? By the way, if one wages war, one does that 
to kill as many enemies as possible. After all, one does not go 
to the front to sell ice cream. [end recording] 
  As I said before, this man is an adviser to the interior 
minister, dealing with matters of the rule-of-law state and 
responsible for the establishment of the police forces. 
  In the offices of Helsinki Watch in Zagreb, all cases of war 
crimes are painstakingly collected. For the employees of the 
organization, this is sometimes a dangerous job. One of them 
has been shot at. Chairman Cicak has been repeatedly attacked. 
Publicizing crimes and dealing with one's own guilt is not 
particularly popular in today's Croatia, since it means to 
finally pay farewell to the long -- perhaps too long -- 
cultivated role of the victim. 
  [Begin Cicak recording, in English with superimposed German 
translation] The fact that we were attacked by Serbian 
aggressors cannot mean that we keep silent about what Croats 
have done to the Serbian minority in Croatia. Here, too, war 
crimes have been committed and it is absolutely necessary that 
Croatia itself punishes them with the means of a rule-of-law 
state. We must not brush that off to the international 
community. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  Tough words also come from Stipe Mesic, president of the 
Croatian Parliament. He has recently parted with Tudjman and 
his party. 
  [Begin Mesic recording, in Serbo-Croatian with superimposed 
German translation] The rule-of-law state in this Croatia does 
not work. There is a lot of corruption and Mafia-like 
connections, even with the highest places of the state. Those 
who are guilty are not prosecuted, civic rights are in massive 
danger. [end recording] 
  Does he believe that things will change in Tudjman's era, 
that war crimes will be punished? 
  [Begin Mesic recording] No, absolutely not. There is no 
chance. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with General Brigadier Tryggwe Tellefsen, </F>
UNPROFOR commander in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
by Aleksandar Damovski, place and date not given: "NATO Base -- 
A Threat to Peace"] 
  [Text] The fifth month of Norwegian General Brigadier 
Tryggwe Tellefsen's command of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] has passed. Unlike his predecessor, Gen. Tellefsen gives 
the impression of being a real soldier for whom the "Holy Bible" 
is the performance of his orders. In a steadfast military 
atmosphere, backed by a framed tourist propaganda advertisement 
for Macedonia and the horns of a reindeer from his homeland, we 
had talks with the general. 
  He is far more retired from the public than his predecessor, 
but Gen. Tellefsen considers the preventive mission of the UN 
peacekeeping forces in Macedonia to be a very wise solution. 
From the discussions he has held with the state authorities of 
Macedonia, he concluded that they also consider the UNPROFOR 
presence to be a stabilizing factor in the country. 
  [Tellefsen] The development of the UN mission so far has 
been very positive and I am really glad to inform you that the 
situation in the regions of the borders with Serbia and Albania 
is calm and stable. 
  [Damovski] Knowing the Macedonian neighborhood, there are 
continual scenarios for the spread of the war. Is Macedonia 
threatened with war from any direction? 
  [Tellefsen] For the time being, I can see no signs of a 
possible military threat to Macedonia from the regions under our 
observation. The challenges and problems we are facing are 
related to the border with Serbia. Lately, we have noted 
increased military activity on the Serbian side of the border. 
The Macedonian authorities have been informed about all that on 
a timely basis, as well as our Command in Zagreb. We have noted 
small groups of soldiers of the Serbian Army moving around the 
Macedonian border region. This is something that worries me. 
<H5>  Stabilizing Factor </H5>
  [Damovski] In your latest statement for Macedonian 
Television, you said that there are 140 km of border between 
Macedonia and Serbia that are disputable. At least for now, 
both sides, that is the Macedonian authority and the previous 
UNPROFOR commander for Macedonia have said that only some minor 
sections of the border with our northern neighbor are 
disputable. Why do you think that such a great part of the 
border is disputable? 
  [Tellefsen] The peacekeeping forces in Macedonia operate on 
the border in conformity with the border that was agreed as an 
inter-republic border in the former Yugoslavia in 1945. We 
started our operation knowing that only a small part of that 
border was disputable. However, our observations say that, 
until now, 140 km of the border has been infringed by Serbian 
soldiers. In that context, I visited Nis [in Serbia] recently, 
for a second meeting with the Serbian military representatives, 
in order to ask about the Serbian activities on the border. We 
had a really fruitful discussion with the Serbian military 
commander, who told me they were holding military exercises of 
the reserve staff. According to what he said, the presence of 
the reserve staff, who do not know the terrain well, was the 
reason for an increased number of border incidents. 
Nevertheless, it is clear that those exercises are not meant 
for any kind of preparations for military activities in 
Macedonia. Therefore, according to those incidents, it emerges 
that 140 km of the border are disputable. From my point of 
view, as well as from the point of view of the Macedonian 
authorities, there is only a small section of the border that is 
disputable. 
  We reported all such border incidents by the Serbian 
soldiers 
on time, but our mandate does not give us the right to arrest 
those soldiers, therefore we only followed them and then we 
reported in detail to the Macedonian authorities. Of course, 
the fact that the border line has not been marked represents a 
problem to my soldiers, too. Our task is to avoid any critical 
situation on the border. We also agreed that the Serbian 
commander will inform me about any military activities in the 
border region on a timely basis. 
  [Damovski] Did you inform the competent Macedonian bodies 
about this meeting? 
  [Tellefsen] Yes, the Macedonian defense minister [Vlado 
Popovski] was informed about it, before and after the meeting. 
Perhaps we shall have to meet the Serbian side on other 
occasions. The military exercises are still under way, and if 
they do not stop soon I shall go to Nis again to ask about the 
exercises and about the possibility of establishing telephone 
contact. 
  [Damovski] If you agree with the assessment that there is a 
great difference between the assignments of the peacekeeping 
forces on the territories of former Yugoslavia, what is your 
opinion about a change in the UNPROFOR mandate for Macedonia? 
  [Tellefsen] The ways we operate in Bosnia, Croatia, and 
Macedonia are based on resolutions. The first resolution 
implied a traditional peacekeeping mission in Croatia in four 
zones, then the humanitarian operation in Bosnia followed, and 
then the preventive assignment, to stop the spread of conflicts 
to Macedonia. If we are looking for possible successes, I 
consider that we have learnt a lot from the UN operation in 
Macedonia. We have learnt that this is perhaps the ideal way of 
solving the problems. 
  At the same time, a UN operation in former Yugoslavia 
without 
particular mandates would have its advantages -- the possibility 
of moving troops from one area to another, if necessary. For 
instance, every week, we send military observers from here to 
Bosnia, depending on the situation. 
  Our mandate here is to be a stabilizing factor and to 
demonstrate the presence of UN forces. The presence of the 
multinational structure of UN soldiers in Macedonia demonstrates 
to the world and the neighboring countries that the world 
community wants Macedonia to be independent. Therefore, our 
stay here represents a great experience for us. 
  [Damovski] Have the Macedonian Government or UNPROFOR 
Command proposed a change to the mandate of the peacekeeping 
forces in Macedonia? 
  [Tellefsen] We are holding continual discussions about the 
mandate, particularly before the end of the six months' period 
of the agreement with the country. The last time was in March 
when we extended the mandate of 1 April in conformity with the 
situation in Macedonia -- by Article 12 of Resolution 908, Mr. 
Akashi has the authority to use his "good services to contribute 
to the maintenance of peace and stability in this republic." 
This is a somewhat broader than the operation of the military 
forces on the borders with Serbia and Albania. From my meetings 
with representatives of the Macedonian authorities, I can 
conclude that their opinion is that the mandate should remain 
unchanged. 
<H5>  I Do Not See a Threat From Greece </H5>
  [Damovski] We have heard several requests by the Democratic 
Party of the Serbs in Macedonia for the arrival of Russian 
soldiers within the framework of the UN forces in Macedonia. 
What is your opinion about this request? 
  [Tellefsen] According to the present UNPROFOR mandate in 
Macedonia, the present number of troops is quite sufficient. 
The combination of the troops from the Nordic countries 
together with the U.S. contingent, from what is probably the 
most powerful military force in the world today, is really good. 
I do not find it necessary to change the configuration of the 
UN force. 
  [Damovski] The same party recently released some 
"confidential information" about the arrival of 2,000 Turkish 
troops in Macedonia, again under the command of the United 
Nations!? 
  [Tellefsen] Nobody has discussed that with me. I have no 
information about that. 
  [Damovski] I can conclude that, for you, it is very 
important to maintain the multinational structure of the blue 
helmets in Macedonia. Yet, after the arrival of 500 U.S. 
troops, that structure has been quite disturbed. 
  [Tellefsen] That proportion has been now balanced -- we have 
around 500 U.S. troops and the same number of soldiers from the 
Scandinavian countries. We should maintain that proportion. 
  [Damovski] Are there any problems with the U.S. troops in 
the coordination and command? 
  [Tellefsen] No. I am impressed with the way the U.S. troops 
succeeded in fully accomplishing the UN peacekeeping mission. 
Usually, a soldier is trained for work in war conditions. 
However, it is even a greater challenge for each soldier to 
operate in a peacekeeping mission. 
  [Damovski] With the arrival of the U.S. troops there were 
rumors about the establishment of a NATO base in Macedonia. The 
great size of the U.S. military delegations just heated these 
stories. Is there any truth in these rumors? 
  [Tellefsen] As far as I know -- no. After taking over the 
command in Macedonia, I have had meetings with quite a number of 
U.S. delegations. We never mentioned such a possibility during 
those discussions. 
  [Damovski] Do you find it necessary to construct a NATO base 
in Macedonia? 
  [Tellefsen] Knowing the situation here -- no. Tension 
should be decreased here, not increased. 
  [Damovski] Does it mean that, in your opinion, the 
establishment of a NATO base in Macedonia would increase tension 
in the region? 
  [Tellefsen] In the present situation -- yes. 
  [Damovski] Why? 
  [Tellefsen] Aware of the fact that the 250 km of the border 
with Serbia is related to a state that does not recognize 
Macedonia, the construction of a NATO military base here could 
be taken as a threat. We know that the Macedonian military 
forces are not capable of facing the Serbian military.... 
Therefore, I think that it would not be a wise action. As far 
as I know, the Macedonian authorities are directed toward the 
CSCE and to Macedonia's membership in the European structures. 
  [Damovski] Macedonia has not been recognized by Greece yet. 
Does it mean that military threats can be also expected from 
that side? Have you ever viewed the possibility of shifting a 
number of your soldiers to the Macedonian-Greek border? 
  [Tellefsen] No. I see no military threat from Greece. So 
far, there have not been any discussions about shifting the 
peacekeeping forces to that part of the border. I see the 
problem with Greece as an economic problem and a problem related 
to the name and flag. Such problems should be solved by 
diplomats and politicians, not by soldiers. 
  [Damovski] Here is a hypothetical question. If Macedonia is 
attacked militarily, what will your orders to your soldiers be? 
  [Tellefsen] If I am the commander in such a situation, I 
would like to see another kind of UN military forces. However, 
today we are a tiny blue line drawn alone the border region with 
Serbia and Albania. We are here to observe and inform, not to 
arrest, fight, or defend the borders of Macedonia. If we are 
faced with such a situation, then some other UN military forces 
will be present here. I cannot see anybody preparing to attack 
Macedonia. If there are such preparations, there will be many 
signs of that. However, for the moment, there are no such 
signals. Any attack against Macedonia would also mean killing 
soldiers from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the United 
States, and from 25 other nations.... Everybody should take 
that fact into account!

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Turks Without Representative in </F>
Constitutional Court"] 
  [Text] Referring to the fact that no judge in the 
Macedonian Constitutional Court is of Turkish origin, the 
Democratic Party of Turks in Macedonian [FYROM -- Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] issued a public protest and 
condemn of the politics of double standards. Although the Turks 
present a constitutive and constructive element of Macedonia's 
statehood, this act is a repeated attempt to leave this minority 
at the margins of the political life in the country, the party 
announcement says. Such behavior results in distrust for the 
government bodies and institutions. The announcement concludes 
this kind of democracy leads nowhere.

  [Text] In Warsaw today, Poland's and Sweden's defense 
ministers, Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Anders Bjorck, signed an 
intergovernment agreement on defense issues. It covers the 
exchange of information, military training, and cooperation 
between arms-manufacturing companies. Following the good 
experience of collaboration between the Mesko Engineering Works 
and the Swedish Bofors, both sides are hoping that Swedish 
participation in modernizing our Iryda and Skorpion aircraft, as 
well as military vehicles and warships, will be similarly 
successful . 
  Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk referred to the fine 
cooperation 
traditions, especially from the interwar period. 
  [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] Now we are going back to 
renewing these traditions. This refers also, or perhaps above 
all, to cooperation in the arms-manufacturing industry. Both 
sides are interested in this cooperation--Sweden and Poland 
equally. Our industry needs an injection of new technologies. 
It will thus be able to make use of its far-from-negligible 
intellectual and production potential. Sweden is agreeing to 
partnerlike cooperation--that is, not to the selling and buying 
of consumables but to investing their technologies in our 
industries. I hope the cooperation is going to be mutually 
beneficial. The first experiences, involving such well-known 
companies as Bofors and Ericsson, are behind us. These 
experiences were positive. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Minister Andres Bjorck emphasized that Poland 
was 
the first postcommunist country with which Sweden has signed an 
agreement on cooperation in the military field. 
  [Begin Bjorck recording, English with superimposed 
translation into Polish] Poland is the first country of the 
former Warsaw Treaty, and we had no doubts that that is how it 
was going to be--first, because your country is leading in 
making democratic changes in this part of the region, and, 
second, both our countries, which are neighbors across the 
Baltic, are interested in maintaining peace and stability in the 
region. Sweden believes peace will not come by itself. It is 
raising its spending for defense purposes that could serve our 
cooperation. It is also important to give content to 
Partnership for Peace, in which our countries are participating. 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] Andres Bjorck also expressed the hope that 
Russia 
would join Partnership for Peace and would not be guided by 
particular interests. 
  The Swedish minister was received by President Lech Walesa 
and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak.

  [Text] Warsaw, 16 May--Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak today 
received Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjorck. The meeting 
was attended by Polish Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk. 
Minister Kolodziejczyk briefed the prime minister on the 
details of an agreement signed between Poland and Sweden. The 
agreement primarily concerns cooperation in the arms industry. 
  Minister Bjorck pointed out that the agreement is the first 
document of its kind signed by Sweden with a former member state 
of the Warsaw Pact. He added that his country is also 
interested in expanding cooperation with Poland within the 
framework of the Partnership for Peace program. 
  Prime Minister Pawlak expressed satisfaction at signing the 
agreement and stated that Poland is interested in wide and 
balanced cooperation, not only in the defense industry but also 
in other branches of the economy. Issues of security and 
stability in the Baltic Sea region were also raised during the 
meeting, a communique by the Government Press Office says.

<F P=106> [Article by "SAR": "Spring Meeting of European Parliament </F>
Members--Poland Willing To Support Russia"] 
  [Text] A three-day spring meeting of the Council of 
Europe [CE] Parliamentary Assembly began in Warsaw on 16 May. 
On behalf of Poland, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy suggested that a 
CE regional office be established in Warsaw, which would be 
designed to suit the needs of Central and East European 
countries. The issue of accepting Russia as a CE member was one 
of the main topics of a meeting of the CE Commission for 
Political Affairs. 
  Miguel Martinez, chairman of the CE Parliamentary Assembly, 
stated during a meeting with Polish President Lech Walesa that 
it is precisely Poland from which the CE expects an opinion 
concerning the incorporation of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, 
among others, into European structures. Ernst Muehlemann, the 
commission's rapporteur, told journalists that there will be no 
preferential treatment or a less rigid application for Russia. 
He stressed that Russia's joining CE is possible "after the 
necessary, democratic reforms are implemented. We have no more 
than a year's time to come to a decision on this issue," he 
added. The commission has also considered the possibility of 
accepting eight other countries that have been striving for 
membership, among them Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia, and Albania. 
Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy said that "involving Russia in 
European structures is in the interest of Poland and Europe; it 
is beneficial from the standpoint of the stability of the entire 
continent. Poland is leaning toward accepting Russia's 
application for membership." 
  While suggesting on behalf of Poland that a regional CE 
office be established in Warsaw, which would be especially 
oriented toward the needs of Central and East European 
countries, Jozef Oleksy said that "these needs require a better 
than heretofore knowledge of them and an improved meeting of 
them." Poland has extensive knowledge of the realities of the 
region, as well as experience in reforming an economy and the 
state. Commenting on the proposal, E. Muehlemann said that the 
issue will definitely be a subject of debate. Because it would 
mean major expenditures, it is only the CE Committee of 
Ministers that is authorized to make a final decision. 
  The CE, a political intergovernmental organization that has 
been active for the sake of European unification, was 
established in 1949. It comprises 32 European pluralistic 
democracies, including nine Central and East European countries. 
Right now, the candidacies of eight other countries are being 
debated, among them Russia, Latvia, and Estonia. Poland became 
the 26th member of the CE on 26 November 1991. The CE 
Parliamentary Assembly holds plenary sessions four times a year 
at its Strasbourg headquarters, and it also holds a fifth 
session--the spring meetings--in one of the member countries.

  [Text] Warsaw, 13 May--Jan Widacki, the Polish ambassador 
to Vilnius, said today during a visit to Warsaw that it is 
untrue to say that the Poles in Lithuania have been deprived of 
their electoral rights. 
  "Limiting participation in the fall local government 
elections to political organizations violates the spirit of 
self-government as understood in Europe and is unfavorable for 
the Poles in Lithuania, particularly for the Union of Poles in 
Lithuania [ZPL], but it is not deprivation of electoral rights," 
Widacki stated. 
  He stressed that the Lithuanian Seimas had not yet passed 
the 
local government election regulations. On 9 May, during partial 
voting, an article permitting only political organizations to 
put forward candidates in the elections was adopted, which means 
the exclusion of social and sociopolitical organizations, which 
include the ZPL, from participation. 
  Widacki stressed that, even if the electoral regulations 
were 
passed in their present form, it would not exclude ZPL members 
from participating in the elections, but they would be forced 
quickly to set up a political organization (election committee) 
[PAP parentheses] based on the ZPL.

<F P=106> [Article by E.O.: "Three-Fourths of People Do not Approve of </F>
President; Lech Walesa Loses Support"] 
  [Text] In April, only 25 percent of the people approved of 
the president's activities, whereas 64 percent were critical of 
them. A previous opinion poll carried out by the Public Opinion 
Research Center [CBOS] last February shows that Lech Walesa's 
popularity dropped by 10 points. In the group of authority 
centers, the president occupied the last position in April as 
far as his activities were concerned. 
  Lech Walesa's popularity in the social opinion has been 
dropping steadily since the middle of 1991. In April 1991, his 
activities were approved by 70 percent of the respondents to a 
CBOS poll. The 25-percent approval for Lech Walesa, declared by 
the CBOS respondents, has been the lowest since the time he took 
over the office. 
  As it turned out, Lech Walesa's conflict with the governing 
coalition (numerous vetoes and public shows of disapproval), 
which took place between February and April of this year, was 
most detrimental to the president himself--he lost as many as 10 
points in popularity opinion polls (in February, 35 percent of 
respondents approved of his activities and 55 percent expressed 
their disapproval). 
  Thus, the office of the president found itself in the second 
to last position in the popularity ranking of various 
establishments. The people declare less trust only for private 
banks (21 percent approve of them). 
  The statistical supporter of Lech Walesa is either younger 
than 25 or older than 65, has rightist political views, and 
takes part in religious activities several times a week. Among 
employed people, he is primarily backed by skilled workers and 
among professionally passive people--by senior citizens, 
disabled pensioners, and unemployed people. 
  The people declare the greatest trust for the Army (76 
percent), the spokesman for civil rights (70 percent), and 
public television (69 percent). 
  Probably because of the "corruption affair" in Poznan, 
approval for police activities decreased by nearly 10 points; 
however, its activities are still accepted by as many as 57 
percent of the people--just as many people support the 
activities of self-governments in their regions. 
  The government and the Sejm are enjoying double the 
popularity of the president. Within the past two months, there 
has also been an increase in the approval of the activities of 
the Senate, whose activities were accepted by 41 percent of the 
respondents in April of this year. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The opinion poll was carried out between 14 and 18 April of 
this year on a representative sample of 1,207 adult inhabitants 
of the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michal Kulesza, government plenipotentiary </F>
for the reform of the administration, by Renata Wrobel; place 
and date not given: "Kulesza: My Mission Has Been Exhausted"] 
  [Text] "If I feel that I am supposed to be the 
government's plenipotentiary for blocking the reform of the 
public administration, I will resign," said Michal Kulesza, the 
government's plenipotentiary for the reform of the 
administration, at one time. Yesterday, during a session of the 
Second Congress of Territorial Self-Government, Kulesza publicly 
informed about his resignation. He was appointed to this post 
by the previous Council of Ministers, the one chaired by Hanna 
Suchocka, in the fall of 1992. RZECZPOSPOLITA asked him to 
explain the reasons for his decision. 
  [Wrobel] Many people expected you to submit your resignation 
soon after last year's parliamentary elections. 
  [Kulesza] I often heard opinions at that time that the fate 
of the reform was a foregone conclusion. I faced the following 
dilemma: Should I look upon myself as a politician of the 
previous government's people, who were cleaning their desks and 
leaving, or the other way around--stay with the hope that the 
issues I dealt with would be continued. 
  [Wrobel] What did you base these hopes on? The new 
government avoided any declarations on the issue of this reform. 
What is more, it began its activities by stopping the pilot 
program in towns and cities. 
  [Kulesza] I believed at the time, and I still do, that the 
reform is inevitable and that it takes not really bad will but 
state abnegation to curb it. I did not think there is such a 
great thirst for power within the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. 
Of course, if someone has emerged from political nonbeing for 
the first time in a couple of decades and has passed from a 
level of village administration to a level of governing the 
country, certain processes are unavoidable. However, I thought 
that, after a certain period, things would begin to die down. 
Reform is a great strategic maneuver that requires time. Those 
who in December wanted the government to know whether it wants 
the reform were wrong. The prime minister must not be pinned to 
the wall: "Unless you reform the state within two weeks, you are 
stupid." 
  [Wrobel] How is what you called "thirst for power" 
detrimental to the reform of the administration? 
  [Kulesza] For example, in changing the cadres in the 
nomenklatura-like style. In the corridors of the 
Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], one can hear people 
whispering that this or that guy is coming back to earn 
additional money to add to his retirement pension. In 
voivodships, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] is taking part 
in the division of loot rather modestly, whereas the PSL is 
filling posts in an extremely brutal manner. I can understand 
that a voivode may not satisfy the prime minister for some 
reasons. However, there must be reasons other than pressure of 
local party elites. The PSL is not changing people because they 
are the wrong people in those places but, rather, because it has 
to satisfy the demand for power within the party. First they 
wanted to change only voivodes, then deputy voivodes, directors 
of departments, and so on. If one manages to snare such a post, 
he is followed by a large group of others. Along with people, 
old ways of governing that we thought we had buried a long time 
ago are coming back. We are witnessing the process of making 
the administration political to a gigantic degree. Minister 
Strak within just a few months recreated a 
nomenklatura-like model of administration, similar to 
the one we had in the Polish People's Republic. In doing so, he 
undid the four-year efforts aimed at making the civil service 
cadres independent of politics. 
  The thirst for power is also reflected in conceptual 
thinking. The PSL achieved its greatest success in Poland after 
1989. In some configuration, it will rule for the next 15 or 20 
years, and, even if it finds itself in the opposition, it will 
be a very strong opposition. In this situation, it is behaving 
narrow-mindedly. It realizes that, when powiat [small 
administrative unit] elections are held, it will take its share, 
but it will require some efforts. Why get tired, then, its 
activists seem to be saying, if we are doing very well anyway? 
  [Wrobel] You were not the PSL plenipotentiary; you were the 
plenipotentiary of the government. The government coalition 
also includes the SLD, which, as it is known, has a different 
view of the reform of the administration. 
  [Kulesza] The PSL is employing effective, even though 
utterly uncivilized, methods in its policy: It is omitting 
substantive aspects of discussions; it is avoiding any kind of 
political "scheming" such as: yes, a reform, but in a slightly 
different manner. The SLD, which seems to be favorably disposed 
toward the reform, is letting it go at that, just as it is doing 
on many other issues. It cannot or does not want to get through 
with its ideas. 
  [Wrobel] Do you not think that curbing the reform may be at 
least partially caused by the hope that, after the forthcoming 
elections to gmina [smallest administrative units] councils, 
more of "our" people will come, and it will be possible to 
adjust possible changes to them? 
  [Kulesza] I do not acknowledge such reasoning at all. If 
the belief that "our people are better" were to be a fragment of 
the state doctrine, it would mean that I have been here a 
half-year too long. 
  [Wrobel] Why did you decide to resign now? 
  [Kulesza] Recently, the real intentions of the government 
have become clear. A deputies' initiative was submitted in the 
Sejm concerning the law on powiats. The Sejm speaker requested 
the government to take a stand. This was at the beginning of 
March. On 24 March, I forwarded a positive opinion to the URM 
head, the prime minister, and the members of the Council of 
Ministers. I did it of my own accord because, as usual, I was 
omitted. Today is the middle of May and there is still no 
answer; the government has not made any decision, nothing has 
come to the Sejm. What does it mean? 
  [Wrobel] It means, perhaps, that the government has more 
important issues to deal with now. 
  [Kulesza] One can say so, although one must have a lot of 
goodwill. Another issue: Early in April, bills concerning the 
government administration and the state civil service appeared. 
I did not work on them, either. I prepared a negative opinion 
because these bills are embarrassing: They are not in line with 
what is happening in modern democracies; they make the 
administration political and reduce the state civil service 
almost to an empty name. No one was interested in this. 
  This is what I had been waiting for. The government's 
attitude to the powiats, to the reform of the center, and to the 
state civil service became clear. I dare say that the name of 
Michal Strak will go down in the history of Poland's 
administrative system as the person who caused the reforms to 
collapse. 
  [Wrobel] Do you think Prime Minister Pawlak is "without 
fault" here? 
  [Kulesza] To me it is understandable that the prime minister 
is not dealing with everything himself because he has his 
ministers. Michal Strak is his chief adviser in administrative 
issues he is in charge of. I dare say that he is fulfilling 
this function in a manner that is dramatically destructive. 
  [Wrobel] What was your position in the present government? 
  [Kulesza] It was absolutely marginal. For half a year I was 
not invited by Minister Strak for substantive talks on the 
functioning of the administration and the reforms. My office 
was gradually denied the possibilities of acting. I saw an 
utter lack of interest in the work that had been done thus far. 
I was often passed up when bills concerning my duties were 
being prepared. The bills that were drafted somewhere else 
either reached me or did not. No one cared about my opinions. 
As far as I know, Minister Strak has organized his own experts' 
teams, which are not conducting a social discussion. 
  I performed a lot of work that I liked and considered 
useful. 
I felt that the minister wanted to take advantage of me as one 
of his URM civil servants. However, I went there not to be a 
civil servant but to prepare a basic reform. If the government 
does not want that, my presence is entirely superfluous. At the 
meeting before the elections of the self-government people, who 
are the people of the reforms, I decided to tell them that my 
mission had been exhausted. I cannot look passively at the 
program of reforms, which Poland needs, being broken to pieces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Romuald Szeremietiew, chairman of the </F>
Movement for the Republic political group, by correspondent 
Krzysztof Stecki; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Stecki] Does Poland need right-wing parties today? 
  [Szeremietiew] It most certainly does. People need to have 
this option open to them. This is attested to by the more than 
2 million votes cast in favor of the right-wing and center 
parties in the latest parliamentary election. Over the past 50 
years, Poland engaged in a left-wing rule experiment, and now we 
must move away from that. All over the world, the left-wing 
orientation is being exposed as a false direction these days. I 
believe that what Poland needs today is not only a right-wing 
party but also a sorting out of the entire political scene. 
This process has already begun. Before long, only a few large, 
significant parties will be left in our country. These will 
most probably be the Union of Labor, the Freedom Union, a 
peasant party, a center-right movement, and an extreme 
right-wing party. I am an optimist but the kind of optimist who 
always considers coolly all of the pros and cons of any given 
situation. I believe Poland will win. 
  [Stecki] What was the chief reason for the split within the 
Movement for the Republic [RdR] group? 
  [Szeremietiew] Before the latest parliamentary election, I 
was largely viewed as a defeatist and a panicmonger by my RdR 
colleagues. I maintained that we should either put all of our 
money on one horse and devote our election campaign exclusively 
to high-power promotion of the RdR or, if we plan to form a 
coalition, do it decisively and unconditionally, even if it 
means deciding not to put up RdR candidates to run side by side 
with the other partners' candidates on the joint election lists. 
However, as it turned out, the RdR aimed its campaign moves in 
all directions, and it ended in disaster. When it came to 
electing new RdR authorities, it turned out that my concept was 
the correct one. 
  [Stecki] To what extent has the RdR changed since you became 
its chairman? 
  [Szeremietiew] Its leadership functions differently now, and 
we cooperate with the media better than before. Jan Olszewski 
was against all unification moves, whereas today the RdR 
conducts unification negotiations, and we are already close to 
finalizing them and calling into being a center-right 
confederation. The character of the party has changed, too. 
Today we focus first of all on promoting the economy and the 
younger cadres, who are needed by Poland today. 
  [Stecki] You have mentioned a planned unification of the 
center and right groups. On what plane do you envisage it? 
  [Szeremietiew] On the program-formulating and organizational 
plane. We have analyzed the programs of our prospective 
partners and found that there are no points there that could not 
be coordinated. Whenever, during our talks, we arrive at a 
point at which differences in details could spoil everything, we 
interrupt the course of the negotiations. In other words, 
details must not be allowed to overshadow the more basic 
concepts. As far as organizational matters are concerned, we 
believe that party structures should cooperate among themselves, 
first in selecting and nominating joint candidates to the Sejm 
and then in selecting and nominating the right-wing group's 
candidate to the office of president. 
  [Stecki] Is there room for Olszewski's adherents in the 
future confederation? 
  [Szeremietiew] Of course. The entire problem is caused by 
the unfortunate fact that people do not understand that there 
are certain rules to be observed in such situations and that 
people who have lost an election do not necessarily have to take 
umbrage. I do not feel personally insulted by my opponents when 
they accuse me of usurping my present position, but I am 
surprised that, in their defeat, they were unable to resort to 
democratic procedures and thereby improve their positions. Once 
they regain their composure, they will realize that there are no 
objections to their joining us in the confederation. 
  [Stecki] Is the proposal submitted by Professor Rafal 
Krawczyk, your plenipotentiary for the economic program, that 
stipulates that you attack Polish bureaucracy through the 
universal privatization scheme intended also as yet another tool 
in the decommunization campaign? Or does the RdR have some 
other plans in this sphere? 
  [Szeremietiew] Of course we do. However, the principal 
objectives of privatization are quite different: to enhance the 
numerical strength of the middle layer of society--that is, the 
group of private owners. I personally do not like the word 
"decommunization" because its meaning has become too diluted by 
propaganda. I prefer the term "de-Sovietization." It is 
de-Sovietization that should be carried out in our armed forces 
so that they cease to resemble the Soviet Army in its structure 
and its philosophy. However, de-Sovietization implies 
predominantly a return to national values and a deliberate 
scattering of cliques and exclusive interest groups. To this we 
should add revised tax and criminal legislation. 
  [Stecki] Prof. Krawczyk talks about the significance of a 
national identity in both our economy and politics. How does 
that relate to Poland's plans to join European structures? 
  [Szeremietiew] As I said earlier, we should foster a return 
to national values in Poland. Indeed, these values should be a 
matter of priority to politicians. This actually ties in with 
the concept of our joining Europe. Here we have two options to 
consider. The first is the Gaullist option, which envisages a 
Europe of fatherlands, or national communities preserving their 
individual national identities. The second is the attempt to 
create a European union of supranational institutions--and that 
is unacceptable to us. In many countries, people protest 
against it already because they understand only too well that 
such a leftist concept carries with it a distinct whiff of 
large-scale bureaucracy. We believe that Poles will be the more 
European the more they are allowed to remain Polish. 
  [Stecki] Can you list for us the mistakes the RdR has made 
to date? 
  [Szeremietiew] First of all, we must appreciate that all of 
the movements that fought for Poland's independence stopped the 
struggle and rested on their laurels far too early after 1989. 
They all believed that because communism was no more everything 
else would take care of itself automatically. As regards the 
RdR, I must admit that we did not make optimal use of the 
opportunity to create a mass-membership party, when, following 
the collapse of our government, so many people came to RdR 
headquarters. We did not seize the chance to use the RdR 
parliamentary party as a perfect propaganda tool--which the 
Union of Real Politics did so brilliantly with its own 
parliamentary caucus. Finally, there is the question of the 
latest parliamentary election. We failed to form a coalition 
then, despite having a perfect opportunity to do just that. 
  [Stecki] Thank you for talking to us.

<F P=106> [Article by "B.D." from Lodz: "Coupons in Return for Lost </F>
Property; 300 Trillion Zlotys Worth of Claims"] 
  [Text] Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw 
Kaczmarek said in Lodz on 13 May that "there will be no 
reprivatization in Poland in the literal sense." The government 
proposes that former owners be given coupons instead of property 
or cash on the condition that the owner in question used to hold 
Polish citizenship. 
  The government's draft law on compensation for real estate 
seized illegally on the basis of provisions enacted in the years 
1944-58 envisages that reimbursement be paid out and that 
nationalization be finalized. 
  Sixty-five percent of reimbursement claims submitted to date 
apply to returning agricultural real estate and forests, 17 
percent pertain to urban real estate, 5 percent to units dealing 
with services and trade, 2 percent to industrial enterprises, 
and 6 percent to other types of premises. The Ministry of 
Ownership Transformations estimates that all of the claims 
together total approximately 300 trillion zlotys [Z]. 
  According to Kaczmarek, paying out such an amount or 
returning all of the property would endanger the state budget. 
He described the governmental reprivatization draft law as 
relatively safe, one that alleviates financial tensions and does 
not arouse new social conflicts. 
  Reimbursement is to be in the form of compensation 
coupons--that is to say, securities that reflect the value of 
the claims. Only individuals with Polish citizenship--at both 
the time the property was seized and currently--would be 
entitled to such coupons. They will also be distributed among 
owners of property left on the territory of areas that currently 
are not included within the Republic of Poland. 
  The draft does not allow for the possibility of returning a 
piece of property partially in the form of coupons and partially 
in the original form. 
  The coupons' value will be determined according to the 
principle of regression. If a claim does not exceed Z1 billion, 
100 percent of the value of the property would be returned in 
the form of coupons. In the case of claims worth between Z1 and 
3 billion, 1 billion would be returned, plus 10 percent of the 
remainder, while, in cases of property valued at Z3 to 10 
billion, Z2.5 billion would be returned, plus 10 percent of the 
remainder. For property worth over Z10 billion, it would be 
Z4.1 billion plus 10 percent of the remaining amount over Z10 
billion. 
  The reprivatization law would become effective three months 
after its publication. Applications would be collected over a 
year's time. 
  Coupons would be valid for 10 years and would be valorized 
by 
having their value increased by 10 percent for every calendar 
year. 
  With these coupons, one could purchase real estate and 
movable property being sold by the State Treasury, by gminas 
[small administrative units], and by self-governmental 
associations. Five percent of shares of each company being 
introduced onto the stock market would be reserved for owners of 
the coupons. 
  The draft law, which applies to reimbursements associated 
with loss of property in the years 1946-58, was approved by the 
Council of Ministers' Economic Committee on 6 May, while, on 
Friday, it was debated during a session by a Council for 
Reprivatization that operates as attached to the ownership 
transformations minister. "The governmental draft 
reprivatization law was written in a hurry and in accordance 
with the worst examples of the Polish People's Republic," said 
Krzysztof Laszkiewicz, the council's chairman. In his view, the 
coupons that are being suggested by the government as 
compensation for property lost will be conducive to corruption. 
These coupons, for which nobody will be willing to sell 
anything, will be losing their value with every passing month. 
But, most probably, so-called skillful people will emerge, who 
will begin purchasing the coupons for pennies while the rightful 
owners will be left with what they have had for the past 
40-something years, which means they will be left with nothing. 
"Only foreign countries will know that, because a law is in 
force, the problem of reprivatization has already been resolved 
in Poland. I think that is the only intention here," 
Laszkiewicz added.

<F P=106> [Article by "E.W.": "Government, Trade Unionists, and </F>
Employers, on Privatization Law; Commission Is Critical of 
Government and of Itself"] 
  [Text] A two-day meeting of a Trilateral Commission 
for Socioeconomic Affairs began at the Labor Ministry on Monday 
[16 May]. Throughout Monday and Tuesday, representatives of the 
government, employers, and trade unions [TU's] will jointly 
debate behind closed doors the strike demands put forward by 
Solidarity, and they will discuss the government's proposals 
regarding changes in the law on state-owned enterprises. They 
will also be speculating as to a justification for raising 
prices on energy carriers and how to improve the situation of 
budget-sector employees. 
  The law on privatization of state-owned enterprises is the 
sixth and final part of a batch of laws comprising the Agreement 
on State-Owned Enterprises. The Ministry of Ownership 
Transformations has suggested several changes to the document 
that had been agreed upon with the previous government. Among 
the proposals approved by the Council of Ministers' Economic 
Committee, the following are included: 
  --A change in the principles of distribution of preferential 
employee shares of an enterprise being privatized, from 10 to 15 
percent of the total number of shares. 
  --The adoption of a principle that the initiative regarding 
transformation of an enterprise into a Treasury-owned 
joint-stock company is up to the organs of the enterprise in 
question. 
  --A promise to come up with a "privatization map," which 
means defining economic areas and the methods through which the 
state will control those areas. 
  The government intends to give up on a legal provision that 
speaks of emission of privatization coupons, and it is being 
planned that it is the chief of the Ownership Transformations 
Ministry who will decide on the particular privatization path an 
enterprise will follow. Still, enterprises would have a month 
in which to submit their vetoes of the privatization paths 
suggested for them, and the government's assurances are that the 
veto will prove efficient in practice. 
  Representatives of the Solidarity trade union were critical 
of the changes in the governmental draft privatization law. The 
trade union wants the government to present its justification 
for withdrawing from the draft law a legal provision concerning 
the possibility of issuing privatization coupons. As NOWA 
EUROPA was told by Longin Komolowski, trade union 
representatives find unsatisfactory the proposal to raise the 
percentage of employee shares in a company being privatized from 
10 to 15 percent. 
  The All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] has suggested 
that details of the law be debated during the commission's 
sessions, instead of within a specific topic-oriented group, as 
provided for in the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises. 
Solidarity fears that a substantive discussion of the law will 
be transformed within the Trilateral Commission into an 
ideological debate concerning the vision of privatization. "The 
privatization law should be discussed by those trade unions that 
have signed the Agreement," Piotr Zak, press spokesman for 
Solidarity, told NOWA EUROPA. But OPZZ Deputy Chairman Maciej 
Manicki voiced the reservation that, if the debate takes place 
at three tables--for employers, for trade unions, and for 
Solidarity--the OPZZ will withdraw from the negotiations.

  [Excerpts] During a morning news conference, Slovene 
Foreign Minister Peterle summarized the main characteristics of 
his recent visits to Uruguay, Argentina, the United States, and 
the Czech Republic. Zvone Zorko reports: 
  [Begin Zorko recording] Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle at 
today's news conference could not say anything essentially new 
since we have reported extensively about his visits and meetings 
with the statesmen and economists in these states from the 
location itself. [passage omitted] We can expect a visit of the 
Slovene prime minister to Argentina this year already, while 
Argentine Prime Minister Menem will visit Slovenia next year. 
  Regarding Peterle's visit to the United States, let us 
single 
out the assessment of the economic experts that it would be 
possible to double the scope of trade between the two countires 
in the near future and the assurance by U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher that the United States will even in the future 
continue to pay appropriate attention to Slovenia and the entire 
Central Europe. Regarding the arms embargo, Minister Peterle 
said that the U.S. secretary of state had acknowledged the new 
arguments, especially the one that because of the embargo 
Slovenia cannot import commercial explosives, urgently needed in 
the planned construction of highways. Regarding succession, the 
United States remains firm in its stand that the FRY cannot be 
the sole successor of the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] 
  Minister Peterle was not willing to answer questions 
concerning relations with Italy. He merely said that the 
Slovene Government still does not have an official standpoint 
from the Italian Government and that it will take its own stance 
once the new Italian policy in this department is defined. [end

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, May 16 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav President 
Zoran Lilic said on Monday that the visit of Russian Patriarch 
Aleksiy II to the people of Serbia and Montenegro was "a great 
contribution to the efforts being invested for peace and harmony 
in the lands of former Yugoslavia...which has been Yugoslavia's 
policy from the start." Lilic was speaking in a meeting with 
the visiting pontiff of the Russian church, Patriarch Aleksiy 
II, and his host, Patriarch Pavle of the Serbian Orthodox Church. 
  Patriarch Aleksiy II said this was a difficult time for both 
Russia and Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and said it was his 
dearest wish -- in his capacity as emissary of the Russian 
Orthodox Church -- to witness a reconciliation among the nations 
living in the former Yugoslav lands. He explained that his main 
task on this visit was to put into practice an initiative, moved 
jointly with Patriarch Pavle, to effect a meeting with the 
leaders of the Croatian Roman Catholic community and the Bosnian 
Islamic community -- Cardinal Franjo Kuharic and Reis ul-Ulema 
Mustafa Ceric, respectively -- in an effort to show the people 
that conflicts should be dealt with through talks, not war. 
  President Lilic said that the two churches had every 
spiritual and moral right to embark on such a mission, and 
described Effendi Ceric's refusal to take part in such a meeting 
at this time as proof that the Moslems are still committed to 
the war option for settling the dispute in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "Experience teaches us that, whatever compromises the 
Bosnian 
Serbs might make, the Moslems invariably upset all agreements 
and stage-manage incidents at crucial times, in which they kill 
innocent civilians," Lilic said. He added that the Moslems' 
chief objective was to keep up the campaign of satanising the 
entire Serbian nation in the global media, to which the Russian 
patriarch added that not even the Russian media had painted an 
objective picture of the position of the Serbs. 
  Patriarch Aleksiy II said the Russian church and people 
believed that sanctions against Yugoslavia were unjust and 
should be lifted, a position that had been supported by the 
State Duma (parliament lower house), which had asked that Russia 
lift the blockade of Yugoslavia. 
  The United Nations imposed draconian sanctions on Yugoslavia 
in May 1992, because of the country's alleged involvement in the 
civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. President Lilic 
said it was clear to the whole world that the sanctions had 
missed their target, and that the Bosnian war could be ended 
only if all Bosnia's warring nations -- Moslems, Serbs and 
Croats -- were treated equally, i.e. if the Serbs, too, were 
given the right to self-determination, just as the other 
Yugoslav nations. 
  Brotherly nations, such as the Montenegrins, Serbs and 
Russians, must be united on the basic questions of nation and 
state, said Lilic and added that these nations "should do their 
all to cherish their tradition, their spiritual orthodox 
culture, by living in peace and harmony with the other nations 
and confessions, as is the case in Yugoslavia where the 50 
religious communities practice their religious affairs 
unhindered."

  [Text] Belgrade, 16 May (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic told reporters today that the visit by 
Russian Patriarch Aleksiy II is a "moral, brave, and peacemaking 
gesture and a sign of support for the Serb people." Official 
talks between the Russian and Serbian patriarchs and President 
Milosevic lasted for about an hour, after which a luncheon was 
given in honor of the respected guest from Russia. 
  After that the Serbian president told reporters: "Let me 
express my great satisfaction on behalf of citizens of our 
country and on my own behalf that we have had the opportunity to 
welcome Aleksiy II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and 
patriarch of Moscow and all Russia. "We interpret this visit as 
a symbol of his efforts to have peace prevail in this area, a 
sign of great solidarity with our people who are experiencing 
great difficulties, and a sign of goodwill and resolve to find 
the best possible solution for the big crisis in the area," 
Milosevic said. 
  Recalling that the friendship between the Serb and Russian 
peoples has historic traditions, President Milosevic stressed: 
"We do not live in history, we live in the present time and for 
the sake of the present time we highly respect this moral, 
brave, and peacemaking gesture by the Russian patriarch -- his 
visit to our country." 
  Patriarch Aleksiy expressed satisfaction with the warm 
welcome in the "fraternal Serbian state." He said: "We are 
deeply grateful to the Serb people who are warmly receiving us, 
as representatives of Russia, wherever we go. This is a 
fraternal visit, but at this time we cannot remain indifferent 
to the bloodshed and suffering of the innocent people in the 
area," the patriarch said. "We will be happy if we succeed in 
making a contribution toward achieving peace in the area," he 
said, and expressed his gratitude to President Milosevic for the 
cordial reception and "for enabling us to hold joint talks about 
all key isses which are troubling this area." 
  Patriarch Aleksiy stressed that the visit is to continue and 
the bishop of Backa, Irinej, has specified that a trip to 
Sokolac and Sarajevo is planned for tomorrow, when the Serbian 
and Russian patriarchs are expected to meet Cardinal Franjo 
Kuharic and Reis ul-Ulema Mustafa Ceric. 
  To a journalist's remark that Sarajevo Radio has reported 
that Mustafa Ceric refused to meet [Serbian] Patriarch Pavle, 
Bishop Irinej said the meeting has been officially confirmed, 
and the Serbian church is not taking media reports as an 
official refusal. 
  After a meeting in the afternoon with Yugoslav President 
Zoran Lilic, the guest from Russia will visit Sremski Karlovci 
and Novi Sad. 
  Patriarch Aleksiy is expected to visit Sokolac and Sarajevo 
tomorrow.

  [Text] Belgrade, 16 May (TANJUG) -- According to Churkin 
there are many problems in the implementation of the Geneva 
talks. One of them is how to bring the parties in the conflict 
fully to agree to what the foreign ministers of the United 
States, Russia, and the European Union [EU] proposed in Geneva. 
  Asked what response he received from Milosevic today, 
Churkin 
said: "Mr. Milosevic and Belgrade strongly support the decision 
to bring an end to hostilities. As regards the concept of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina union and the territorial division -- this is 
left to the Bosnian Serbs to pass their judgement. I hope, for 
two reasons, that their position will be positive -- because the 
percentage of the territorial division (51:49 per cent) is not 
negotiable, and this is valid for all sides in the conflict, not 
only the Serbs, and because this agreement is in the interest of 
both the Serbs and the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia." 
  As expected, the sanctions were discussed at the talks 
today. 
Churkin said that he "explained to President Milosevic the 
paragraph referring to the sanctions from the final document of 
the ministerial meeting." 
  "This paragraph opens very good possibilities for the 
Serbian 
side. The key members of the international community -- Russia, 
the United States, and the EU -- said jointly for the first time 
that the realization of the Geneva agreement would bring about a 
gradual lifting of the sanctions. I believe this is a strong 
incentive." Slobodan Milosevic and Vitaliy Churkin also 
discussed the problem of Brcko. "I received assurances from the 
Serb side that they are not carrying out offensive operations 
there," Churkin said. He added: "I also received support for 
the idea to end hostilities. I concluded after the talks today 
that the Bosnian Serbs would not oppose the deployment of 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] along the demarcation lines in 
the Brcko region." 
  Asked to comment on the recommendation by the Duma to the 
Russian Government to lift sanctions against the FRY, Churkin 
said that he has not had the chance to see the full text of the 
decision. "Let me remind you that the recommendation was passed 
following the decision by the U.S. Senate [on lifting the arms 
embargo]. I hope that our two legislative bodies will not 
oppose each other, as our governments are not opposing each 
other. On the contrary, I hope they will work on a joint 
position." 
  At the end Churkin was asked if he was going to Pale from 
Belgrade. He gave a brief answer: "No, I am returning to 
Moscow today."

<F P=106> [Report by Shefqet Rexhepi on news conference given by </F>
Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, in 
Prishtina on 13 May: "Kosova at the Geneva Ministerial Meeting"] 
  [Text] Serbian repression, concentrated particularly on 
the outskirts of Kosova towns, continued last week, with 
house-searches on the pretext of looking for weapons, 
accompanied by cases of maltreatment and arrests in the communes 
of Malisheve, Istog, Gllogovc, Mitrovice, Gjilan, Ferizaj, 
Kline, Kamenice, Prishtina, etc. Repression against Albanian 
schools also continued, as in the case of Istog, besides 
repression against the Albanian Teachers' Alliance, the Gjakove 
Finance Council, and Kosovar sport, The gunshots at Kodra e 
Diellit in Prishtina, i.e. within the city, were a serious and 
very significant incident. There were also forced evictions 
from apartments. 
  Last week was also characterized by movements of the Serbian 
army through Kosova, on the pretext of exercises. In fact this 
was a threat to the population of Kosova. The commander of the 
Third Army in Nis himself admitted the nature of this threat, 
saying that these exercises are being conducted with the aim of 
preventing an uprising of the Albanian populace or to maintain 
peace in Kosova, despite the well-known fact that the Albanians 
have declared themselves in favor of a peaceful solution to the 
problem of Kosova. These threats are a bad omen, and we 
therefore draw the international community's attention to the 
consequences they may entail. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the 
republic of Kosova, began yesterday's news conference in 
Prishtina with these comments. 
<H5>  Sali Berisha's Important Visit to Romania </H5>
  Kosova continues to be at the center of attention of 
international institutions and different world figures. Dr. 
Ibrahim Rugova welcomed the recent CSCE statement on Kosova and 
the debate in the U.S. Congress and in the Foreign Affairs 
Committee chaired by Hamilton, which had devoted particular 
attention to Kosova. Dr. Ibrahim Rugova went on to welcome the 
very important visit of Sali Berisha, president of the Republic 
of Albania, to Romania, also appreciating his commitment to 
solving the question of Kosova. After expressing the hope that 
the question of Kosova will be placed on the agenda of the 
ministerial meeting to be held in Geneva, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova 
again demanded that Kosova be placed under the supervision of 
the international community. 
  President Rugova went on to reply to journalists' questions. 
Asked about the Serbian rulers' threats to ban the activities of 
the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] Dr. Ibrahim Rugova stressed 
that there had been demands to ban the LDK ever since it 
started, and there were also such demands last year. In the 
context of the question of banning this party, the so-called 
prefect of Kosova Simovic also mentioned Hogg. The British 
Embassy in Belgrade has meanwhile issued a denial that the 
question of registering the LDK had been discussed during his 
visit to Prishtina. Threats to ban the activities of the 
largest political party in Kosova are a highly dangerous step. 
This shows a tendency to destroy political life in Kosova. 
  A ban of the LDK would be the most serious kind of 
provocation of the Albanians. This would not be a wise step for 
the Serbian regime, and this party will continue its work. A 
Serbian journalist asked whether the party would be registered. 
There is no question of registration, President Rugova said. 
We were registered under the former Yugoslav federation, of 
which we were a part when the Kosova authorities were suspended. 
This is merely a game and a pretext to ban this party. The 
Serbian regime should therefore think carefully about this as it 
is a dangerous step. 
<H5>  We Must Be Careful </H5>
  Asked what he thought about the talks conducted by foreign 
delegations with people who have no legitimacy, Dr. Ibrahim 
Rugova stressed that all the delegations that come from abroad 
talk to the relevant personalities and institutions in Kosova, 
to me, to the LDK and other parties, and to various people in 
order to learn their views. This is normal. There have been no 
attempts to identify some other party in order to achieve 
something different. It is in the meantime well known who 
possesses legitimacy in Kosova. On the basis of the elections, 
we possess our authorities and institutions. The next questioner 
said that criticisms are being raised against peaceful 
resistance. There are demands for a more active resistance, and 
even the organization of demonstrations. Dr. Ibrahim Rugova 
said that we receive these criticisms in the spirit of the 
differences of opinion displayed in relation to our movement. 
Our movement has been called passive, but it is not passive; on 
the contrary, it is active. This is shown by our political and 
institutional organization and the organization of our life. 
The patience we have shown when faced with the violence and 
murders that take place in Kosova is also active resistance, and 
is appreciated by the world. Not out of fear, but because of 
the situation in which we find ourselves, it must be stressed 
that even peaceful demonstrations are dangerous, and we must 
therefore be careful. 
  As for the question of whether the question of Kosova will 
be 
raised at the ministerial meeting in Geneva, President Rugova 
stressed that the request has been made for Kosova to be treated 
at this meeting, because there can be no comprehensive solution 
for the former Yugoslavia without a solution for the problem of 
Kosova. Despite the tragic problem of Bosnia, we hope that 
Kosova too will be on the agenda at this meeting, he stressed. 
Asked whether any confusion persists regarding the visit of 
British Minister of State Douglas Hogg to Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim 
Rugova said that there is no confusion for us. His visit and 
the statement he made in Kosova were very important for us. 
These were the reasons why attempts were made to incriminate 
and cast aspersions on his visit. He was one of the 
highest-level figures to visit Kosova, which is very important 
for us, president Rugova emphasized. 
<H5>  It Is Known Who Performs Ethnic Cleansing </H5>
  Asked about Milosevic's statement that it was the Albanians 
who first started ethnic cleansing, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said that 
it is well known who started ethnic cleansing. I will go no 
further than to recall the period between the two world wars 
when Cubrilovic and Andric drew up plans for the emigration of 
the Albanians. They were deported to Turkey, and these programs 
were carried out after the war too. The case of Bosnia best 
shows who is carrying out purges. This is clear to the world. 
However, when the question of Kosova is raised before the 
international public, the Albanians are accused of something 
they have never done. Quiet ethnic cleansing is taking place in 
Kosova, in that Albanians are leaving because of the violence to 
which they are subjected. Serbia showed who is carrying out 
purges when warnings came of the repatriation of Albanians from 
some Western countries. 
  Commenting on this statement by Milosevic, Professor Dr. 
Fehmi Agani recalled the statement by Karadzic, who said that he 
had not bombarded the civilian population in Brcko. Sarajevo 
was surrounded and bombarded for two years, but the other side 
denied this. This is a manner of thinking that on the one hand 
ignores facts and on the other despises and shows contempt for 
the public, who are told to "listen to what I say."

<F P=106> [Interview with Albanian President Sali Berisha by Samih </F>
'Abdallah in Tirana; date not given] 
  [Text] ['Abdallah] Mr. President, it was noticed that you 
reacted with anger following the recent border incident with 
Greece. However, things calmed down and the crisis seems to be 
heading toward a solution. What exactly happened on the borders 
with Greece and why did your reactions vary with the passage of 
time? 
  [Berisha] I do not think that we acted angrily. If you read 
our first message to the Greek Government in the wake of the 
massacre you would see that we expressed the conviction that the 
terrorists came from Greek territory and returned to it after 
executing the operation. In the same message we asked the Greek 
Government to identify the culprits and condemn the attack. 
Therefore, I don't think that this was evidence of anger. 
  But the Greek reaction was weird. They failed to express 
regret or convey condolences to the families of the victims. 
This made us believe they were gloating over the crime. It 
was, therefore, natural for us to believe that the Greek 
Government supports such deeds. We had information last year 
that a number of elements were trained in Greece and then Prime 
Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis was informed of the matter. 
  ['Abdallah] But did the Greek Government supervise the 
training? 
  [Berisha] Yes, the government did supervise the training at 
that time. But later we received information that the 
government had ended the training. At any rate, the culprits 
came from Greek territory. The Greek Government did not respond 
to our demands at the beginning, but later it responded. 
  Consequently, we decided to postpone any downsizing of the 
staffs at the embassies until the problem is discussed by the 
two countries' foreign ministers during their upcoming meeting. 
This is what happened, but the Greeks might have a different 
viewpoint of the incident. 
  ['Abdallah] Are you sure that the culprits came from Greece? 
  [Berisha] Certainly. We identified their tracks, which 
showed that the culprits came from Greece and later returned 
there. 
  ['Abdallah] But why are the Greeks trying to foment trouble 
on their border with Albania? 
  [Berisha] Since the beginning of the century and for the 
past 
50 years, the Greeks have been pursuing a policy based on using 
terrorism and terrorists against southern Albania. But I don't 
believe that the Greek Government was behind this specific 
incident; otherwise we would have asked them to punish the 
culprits. However, we do not believe that the incident was an 
isolated one, because the Greek Army has in the past provoked us 
by firing at our boats sailing in our territorial waters. 
  ['Abdallah] When did this happen? 
  [Berisha] Two months ago. But they denied it. I don't think 
this is the right way to create a good atmosphere to promote 
bilateral relations. 
  ['Abdallah] But why are they doing this? What is their 
objective? 
  [Berisha] The Greeks are afflicted with nationalistic 
fervor. 
They have ties with the Serbs, and through this alliance they 
think that they can make gains toward reconstructing the Balkan 
area. 
  ['Abdallah] Do they have any regional claims in Albania? 
  [Berisha] Greece has not yet signed the Florence protocol, 
which is quite important in the border issue. 
  ['Abdallah] Does this mean that they do not recognize the 
present borders with Albania? 
  [Berisha] They recognize the borders, but they have not 
signed yet. 
  ['Abdallah] What about the internal secessionist movements 
in 
southern Albania? 
  [Berisha] There are no such movements. But there are signs. 
  ['Abdallah] Do you recognize the Greek minority in southern 
Albania? 
  [Berisha] There is a Greek minority in the south. I am 
pleased to say that Albania guarantees all rights, including 
human rights, to this minority. 
  ['Abdallah] Are they entitled to learn the Greek language 
and 
do they have their own press? 
  [Berisha] They have three newspapers and well over 88 
schools, which cover all stages of elementary and higher 
education. They have their own parties and establishments. 
They have ministers and judges. They will continue to enjoy 
these rights; these events will not affect our policies toward 
the minorities. They are Albanian citizens and we respect their 
rights. 
  ['Abdallah] Mr. President, do you have a specific stand on 
the conflict between Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] and Greece? 
  [Berisha] Yes. We have no particular stand regarding the 
name, but Macedonia has to accept a compromise regarding the 
issue of their flag and some other matters. In my opinion, 
Greece is taking a mistaken approach regarding the name and the 
economic boycott. However, a dialogue is necessary between the 
two countries. 
  ['Abdallah] Do you have any problems with Macedonia 
regarding the Albanian minority residing there? 
  [Berisha] Yes. There is a human rights problem that must be 
resolved. There is some progress, however, and we expect 
further progress in the future. 
  ['Abdallah] What are your specific demands? 
  [Berisha] There should be a census to determine the number 
of Albanians; schools should be opened at all levels. Albanians 
should have the right to use their language and they should be 
allowed to enter all the Macedonian state's institutions. 
  ['Abdallah] Is this the same requirement as for Kosovo 
province? 
  [Berisha] The situation is different in Kosovo. The 
Albanians there constitute 95 percent of the population. One 
has to establish whole institutions for them; and agreement 
should be reached through dialogue and through agreements 
between the various parties on the special status of the region. 
  ['Abdallah] Do you believe that the situation in the region 
is quiet now? 
  [Berisha] No, there is great oppression. 
  ['Abdallah] What is your opinion on current events in 
Bosnia? 
  [Berisha] The situation there is very difficult and the 
peace process seriously fails to meet the requirements. 
  ['Abdallah] What mistakes are the international community 
making in its efforts to resolve the conflict? 
  [Berisha] The international community must treat the Serbs 
and Milosevic more forcefully. The aggressors must be punished. 
  ['Abdallah] How can they be punished? Militarily? 
  [Berisha] That is a naive question. Of course, militarily. 
  ['Abdallah] Aren't the air strikes NATO is carrying out 
against the Serbian positions enough? 
  [Berisha] These air strikes are merely symbolic. They 
should take place on a much larger scale. 
  ['Abdallah] What would be the objective of such large-scale 
strikes? 
  [Berisha] The objective is to prove that Bosnia must 
continue to exist as a state, either within a federal or a 
confederal framework. Bosnia must remain united. 
  ['Abdallah] Do you not see the agreement between the Muslims 
and the Croats that was signed recently in Washington as an 
introduction of partitioning? 
  [Berisha] No, I see the result as an agreement between two 
sides; and the third side, the Bosnian Serbs, must respond. 
  ['Abdallah] But Mr. President, the agreement speaks of a 
confederation with Croatia. 
  [Berisha] This will take place at a later stage. The 
international community must not accept the status quo imposed 
by the Serbian occupation. That would be the first step toward 
many problems in the Balkan. There would be a series of wars in 
the Balkans and many countries would take part in them. The 
only way to avoid all of this is to punish the aggressor. 
  ['Abdallah] Mr. President, there is a famous principle in 
the OAU Charter that stipulates that countries should adhere to 
the borders defined by colonialism on the continent, despite the 
numerous problems these borders create. Do you not believe that 
the Balkan countries, with all the problems they have among 
themselves, should agree on something similar to this? 
  [Berisha] It is vital that borders in the Balkans should not 
be changed by force. 
  ['Abdallah] Why can't the borders stay as they are and 
each state keep the minorities it has within its borders? 
  [Berisha] Yes, that is what is required. 
  ['Abdallah] But this will mean that Kosovo will stay with 
the Serbs, Albania will keep the Greek minority, just as 
Bulgaria will keep the Turkish minority, and so on. 
  [Berisha] (Interrupting) No, you are comparing two different 
situations. How can you compare a situation where you have 
40,000-60,000 Greeks in southern Albania and 2 million Albanians 
in Kosovo? 
  ['Abdallah] Why is Fatos Nano, the leader of the Albanian 
opposition, in prison now? Are the reasons political, or does 
it have to do with financial improprieties, as has been 
announced? 
  [Berisha] Why do you not ask the same question of the 
Italian authorities to find out why de Michelis and some other 
Italian politicians are being tried? The reasons are the same. 
They, together with Fatos Nano, committed crimes of corruption 
pertaining to the aid given by Italy to Albania (when Nano was 
prime minister of Albania). There was embezzlement in an amount 
of $9 million. Had the reasons been political, there would have 
been others the government could have taken to court. 
  ['Abdallah] How far has your reform program gone after two 
years in power? 
  [Berisha] I believe that in those two years we have made 
great progress in this regard. Inflation has dropped from 400 
percent to 30 percent. Last year we had the highest rate of 
development in the whole of Europe--11 percent, according to the 
IMF evaluations. Our currency is stable. In addition, we have 
freed all our prices. This puts us at a difficult stage, but 
this is the only thing we can do to encourage production. We 
have also privatized all agricultural land, homes, services, and 
transport. 
  ['Abdallah] What about foreign aid? 
  [Berisha] We are grateful to all those who have helped us. 
This aid has been used as best as possible. Now, we do not need 
urgent aid; we need economic cooperation. 
  ['Abdallah] Do you cooperate with any Arab or Islamic 
countries? 
  [Berisha] We cooperate with Egypt, Kuwait, Turkey, Malaysia, 
and Saudi Arabia. Cooperation with these and other countries is 
constantly increasing. 
  ['Abdallah] What about your work agenda for Albania in the 
coming stage? 
  [Berisha] Increasing cooperation with the countries in the 
region and merging the state with the European institutions are 
our two major goals for the next stage. In addition, we are 
trying to prevent conflicts in the region and to liberate and 
strengthen the economy. 
  ['Abdallah] What do you expect from the meeting between the 
Greek and Albanian foreign ministers? Do you have some sort of 
prescription to prevent a repetition of such border incidents? 
  [Berisha] The Greeks have to stop those activities that 
negatively affect bilateral relations. That is the first thing. 
Albania has tried to be friends with Greece, but the Greeks were 
not happy with our friendship. 
  We will continue our attempts to have good neighborly 
relations, especially since there are many factors that 
encourage such relations. I believe they also want that, not 
only for the sake of our two countries, but for the sake of the 
whole region.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Berisha: Bulgaria Prevented </F>
Attempts for Division of Macedonia"] 
  [Text] "Bulgaria refused to take part in the secret 
meeting with Greece and Serbia in 1991, thereby sparing 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
from what could have become another conflict on the Balkans," 
the Albanian President Sali Berisha announced yesterday at the 
airport in Vienna. Berisha discussed this question with the 
Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev during his stay in Sofia last 
month, when he thanked Zhelev for turning down the invitation to 
take part in the meeting. 
  "President Zhelev's standpoint against this meeting is very 
important. If Zhelev had accepted at the time the events would 
have taken a completely different course," Berisha said. 
  Asked by the reporters at the Vienna airport whether the 
meeting could have led to the eruption of a new conflict on the 
Balkans, Berisha said: "Macedonia would have absolutely faced 
enormous difficulties." 
  Berisha also stated that the former Greek Prime Minister 
Mitsotakis had invited Zhelev and the Serbian President 
Milosevic to attend a secret meeting in Athens in order to 
discuss Macedonia [passage indistinct] where numerous ethnic 
Albanian population resides. The meeting was supposed to begin 
around the time of the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation 
and the first signs of a war between Croatia and the rebel Serbs. 
  Further on, Berisha stated that the creation of a 
Greek-Serbian-Bulgarian axis was planned at the meeting, which 
would review Macedonia's fate and could have brought about the 
division of the Republic among the three Balkan neighbors. 
  "Milosevic accepted to take part in the meeting, but Zhelev 
refused to participate in this trilateral meeting." 
  "Zhelev said," Berisha added, "no, I will not come without 
Macedonia being present," Berisha said in Vienna.

<F P=106> [Article by Xh. Rexhepi: "Why Lambast Hogg?"] </F>
  [Text] As we know, Douglas Hogg, secretary of state and 
the British Foreign Office's number two, paid an official visit 
to Kosova last week. As the public has been informed at length, 
he talked here with both the Albanian and Serbian sides about 
solving the problem of Kosova. Regardless of how this visit was 
reported and judged, diplomatic circles appreciated it as an 
important effort by British diplomacy toward solving the serious 
crisis in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, testing the 
pulse for possible Albanian-Serbian dialogue for the solution to 
the question of Kosova, to which international bodies are 
increasingly committed. 
  However, in spite of this and regardless of the 
exceptionally 
serious and complicated nature of the subject under discussion, 
Serbian propaganda has not even spared this British diplomat 
abuse and distortion of his statements, for the sake of Serbian 
policy toward Kosova and the Albanians. This does not surprise 
anybody, because this is standard practice in the controlled 
Serbian media. Anti-Albanianism and hatred of Albanian culture 
and history have become a proof of "professional" standards in 
the hysterical anti-Albanian competition. 
  As always, the Serbian rulers installed in Kosova have not 
lagged behind. Simovic, the "local sheriff" [nacallniku i 
okrugut], warned two days ago that he would call a halt to the 
activities of what he called "Rugova's party," meaning the 
Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK]. According to him, the reason 
for this lies in the fact that this party is not registered in 
Serbia (!). In order to back up this threat that has long been 
trumpeted by assorted sections of the Serbian establishment, he 
even misused the high-level British diplomat Douglas Hogg, 
ascribing to him amazement over "why the LDK is not registered 
in Serbia and how it can operate without this." 
  How far this canard will run Simovic alone knows. However, 
regarding the aim of such a threat, the Albanian and 
international public know very well and have heard many times 
that it is the Serbian police and judicial system that are doing 
most to obstruct the work of the LDK, the largest and most 
influential party in Kosova, and have done since its foundation. 
The fact that not a day goes by without maltreatment of this 
party's activists, many of whom are being held in prison, are 
detained for what are called informative discussions, and are 
obstructed in their legal political work shows that the LDK is a 
thorn in the flesh of Great-Serbian circles in Kosova and 
Serbia. It is for this reason that both the ruling Socialists 
and the ultranationalists of the Arkan and Seselj kind hold 
forth against it with the same enthusiasm. Both sides 
accumulate points among their own electorates with their stands 
against Kosova and the Albanians and threats toward the LDK, the 
president of the Republic of Kosova, and the republic's other 
legitimate representatives. 
  Viewed from this angle, Simovic's statement contains nothing 
new and would not deserve comment. However, that fact that it 
was made after the discussions that Hogg held in Kosova once 
again exposes the reality that the Serbian establishment does 
not wish to involve the real political forces and the legitimate 
authorities of the Albanian people in Kosova, led by Dr. Ibrahim 
Rugova, president of the republic, in the inevitable 
Albanian-Serbian talks. For this reason, it is these forces 
that are most attacked and threatened both by ruling Serbian 
circles and those who support and assist these circles in the 
anti-Albanian hysteria. 
  However, despite such a savage campaign against the 
legitimate representatives of the Albanians in Kosova, Serbian 
circles have been informed umpteen times, not only by the LDK 
and the president of Kosova, but by other Albanian political 
parties in Kosova, that only Kosova's legitimate representatives 
can decide Kosova's destiny. As we know, this legitimacy was 
achieved by the will of the people in the first multiparty 
elections in Kosova two years ago. Thus, beyond this legitimacy 
and the political will of the people expressed in the referendum 
of September 1991, nobody has a mandate to decide on Kosova, as 
Kosova's political parties and legitimate representatives have 
said many times. However, it seems that from now on this must 
be said more often and with more insistence.

<F P=106> [Report by Edmond Laci: "Oil Toward the War Zone"] </F>
  [Text] Shkoder -- The embargo against Yugoslavia is still 
being broken from Albanian territory. Even though the Albanian 
authorities have recently greatly intensified their response, 
fuel still makes its way toward the most bloody war zone in 
Europe. However, in the most recent incidents involving this 
illegal traffic, not only smugglers and various oil distribution 
firms but employees and even officers of the Shkoder Border 
Police have been proved to have been involved. In the meantime, 
firms suspected of being directly involved in shipping fuel to 
Montenegro are the focus of investigations by the general 
Directorate of the Albanian Financial Police. In recent days, 
the financial authorities have requested the suspension of the 
contract of the Italian-Albanian AIP firm, because, they claim, 
"80-90 percent of its fuel heads for Shkoder." 
  Immediately after the discovery of six tanker trucks 
returning empty from the Yugoslav border, Fejzi Tahiri, officer 
at the Murgian border post, was detained on suspicion of having 
allowed these vehicles to cross illegally into Montenegro. The 
drivers of the six oil-smuggling tankers were also sent to 
prison. Official sources in Shkoder state that the detained 
persons come from the towns of Elbasan, Vlore, and Patos. A few 
days ago, when two other tanker trucks were observed to cross, 
five soldiers and one officer of the border police post at Pulaj 
were detained, all accused of "allowing vehicles involved in oil 
smuggling to cross in collaboration with Albanian citizens." 
Meanwhile, according to investigations by the general 
Directorate of the Financial Police, it is suspected that the 
six tankers sequestrated after returning from Yugoslav territory 
were loaded in Durres by the Italian-Albanian firm AIP. 
Following evidence from other incidents, the General 
Directorate of the financial Police has asked for the joint 
contract to be suspended, arguing that "a good part of AIP's 
activity, in other words about 80-90 percent of its oil, is 
directed toward Shkoder, with an ultimate destination beyond the 
Albanian state border."

<F P=106> [Report by P.Re.: "Hunger Strike Ends"] </F>
  [Text] Tirana -- The hunger strike in Kukes, an event 
whose drama shocked the entire country at the end of last week, 
has ended. After a meeting with a delegation of the strikers 
lasting many hours, the government has promised to meet most of 
the demands so strongly put forward by many inhabitants of the 
villages of Kukes. 
  Finally, after many days of bargaining, the government's 
representatives and the strikers whose land had been inundated 
succeeded in finding a common language. This was confirmed to 
journalists on 12 May by the chairman of the strikers' 
delegation, chosen unanimously the day before at the joint 
meeting of the strikers holed up in the local government 
building and the Lake of Fierze Association of the Flooded Out. 
"We are now sort of satisfied," the strike chairman said as he 
emerged from his meeting with Prime Minister Meksi, "because 
our main demands were met." He also expressed confidence that 
the government's latest promises would also lead others to give 
up their hunger strike. 
  The government has agreed to quickly implement various 
measures designed to ease the burden of poverty under which 
these areas labor. The peasants of Kukes have first been 
promised compensation with land or in cash for their land 
inundated by the Lake of Fierze. These people will also benefit 
from long-term loans for house-building and preferential loans 
for the development of private agriculture. For those 
inhabitants who even after these measures will still find it 
difficult to live on their small areas of infertile land, the 
government has undertaken to organize emigration to more 
prosperous areas of the country where there is still free state 
land. Specialists will review once again social welfare for the 
inhabitants of Kukes. One of the measures promised by the 
government has been an increase in the level of social support 
for these people. Kukes will also be given preference in the 
distribution of humanitarian aid and other forms of assistance. 
  The government's representatives failed to agree to only two 
of the demands included in the strike program: co-ownership of 
the Fierze hydroelectric station and the payment of rent for the 
inundated land.

  [Text] The attitude of the DPS [Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms] toward the Berov government has become clear from a 
report that we have just received from BTA. After touring the 
Kurdzhali region for four days, Ahmed Dogan declared that the 
DPS central leadership and its electorate share a common view 
concerning the cabinet's fate. The DPS supports a 
left-of-center model for the economy, if the social cost of the 
transition is determined. It will be difficult for the cabinet 
to fall, he said, and if any of the other parliamentary groups 
receive a mandate to form a cabinet, none of them will be able 
to form either a one-party or coalition government. Dogan said 
that the alternative of a caretaker cabinet is dangerous; 
according to him, such a cabinet could only operate for 2 to 6 
months and would supplant the parliamentary form of government, 
delay the agreement on the foreign debt, and lead to 
hyperinflation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nedim Gendzhev, former chief mufti of </F>
Bulgaria, by Diana Petrova; place and date not given: "Dogan 
Works Against Bulgarian State, Lyutfi Is Indebted to Moon"] 
  [Text] [Petrova] Dr. Gendzhev, the Bulgarian Turks 
invested much hopes in the Movement for Rights and Freedoms 
[DPS], which promised to protect their interests. Now the DPS 
is in the parliament, there is a cabinet formed with the DPS 
mandate, but its constituency is the poorest in the country. 
What are the reasons for the DPS' failure? 
  [Gendzhev] I am well-informed and I know that the DPS was 
formed by the former Bulgarian Communist Party and State 
Security. The establishment of the DPS pursued two goals: The 
first was to prevent the Muslims from voting for the Union of 
Democratic Forces [SDS]. If they would have voted for the SDS, 
it would have won the first elections. 
  The second goal was to prevent the restoral of the rights of 
the Turks and Muslims in Bulgaria. They succeeded also in this 
sphere. What rights that existed before 1984 were restored? 
Before 1984 there were three Turkish theaters in Bulgaria. Now 
there are none. The Bulgarian radio had three two-hour programs 
in Turkish; now there are only 15-minute programs. The DPS 
promised a two-hour television program. Instead the wives of 
Yunal Lyutfi, Vedal Sakalu, and others paraded around in Turkey 
for six months. 
  Up to 1959 there were 1,390 Turkish schools. Now we do not 
even have the right to four hours of compulsory Turkish language 
studies, and I do not mean special schools. 
  They also lied to the people about the tobacco issue. They 
tamed the strike and pocketed the commissions from Bulgartabak. 
Let Dogan tell me now who will vote for him in Krumovgrad or 
Kurdzhali region. I will curse them if they cast a single vote 
for Dogan. 
  They did not accomplish even five things in five years. In 
my village, Glodzhevo, 600 people get their bread on credit -- 
the owner of the bakery shop writes their names in his ledger. 
Unemployment among Bulgarian Muslims is 80 percent. The Law on 
the Land does not help us at all. People from Kurdzhali live in 
the village of Listets, Silistra region. They moved there after 
the local Turks emigrated to Turkey. In August 1944 the land 
was purchased by five or six wealthy landlords, and in September 
a collective labor farm was formed. The owners never saw their 
land. However, instead of returning the land now to those who 
worked it all those years, they return it to the same landlords. 
The people do not even have money to lease the land. A 
businessman from Petrich cultivates it. This is the merit of 
the DPS. 
  The people understood that Dogan does not serve the 
Bulgarian 
state. He serves foreign interests. I know very well that he 
was recruited in Paris. 
  [Petrova] In the chief mufti affair the DPS opposed you. 
Was the only reason your personal feud with Dogan? 
  [Gendzhev] Destroying the structure of the Muslim religion 
in Bulgaria was another goal the DPS successfully achieved. The 
DPS also participated actively in destroying the Bulgarian 
Eastern Orthodox Church. Yunal Lyutfi visited the United States 
as Moon's personal guest! It became clear who was interested in 
destroying the two religions. The Eastern Orthodox Church will 
never again be united in Bulgaria. Even if Patriarchs Maksim 
and Pimen retire to monasteries, Galaktion and Neofit will not 
work together, while the priests and the people already are 
divided. There will never again be a united church. I will 
take Metodi Spasov [former director of the Department of 
Religions] to court and claim compensation for the moral and 
material damage that was inflicted on me. I will demand 500,000 
leva as compensation for the damage done by dismissing me. The 
Supreme Court already stated that I was illegally dismissed from 
the chief mufti post, and now I will demand to restore me to 
this post. 
  [Petrova] Now Mehmed Hodzha wants to form a new DPS. Do 
you think he has a chance? 
  [Gendzhev] No! At present he has absolutely no chance at 
all. To form a new DPS within the SDS is childish. The people 
get smarter. Why is it that no political party is interested in 
new elections? I am sure that this parliament will function 
until October 1995, when the regular parliamentary elections 
will take place. Let those who deceived the people worry! 
Mehmed Hodzha could organize a small group of supporters, if 
the SDS contributes a penny or two, so that he could organize 
branches. However, this is not what the people want. They want 
to know, for example, how did Mehmed Hodzha manage to acquire a 
tailor shop in the village of Kaspichan and employ 40 women 
there. The people want to know who did what. This also applies 
to all other parties. Now it appears that the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] and the SDS each have the support of 20 
percent of the voters. Well, those are the BSP pensioners and 
those who benefited from the restitution initiated by the SDS. 
And what about the other 60 percent? They have not decided 
yet. For my part, I do not see a real force that could attract 
those voters. Look, the Social Democratic Party shrunk. [Party 
leader Petur] Dertliev got involved in various polemics and 
personal quarrels, and weakened his party. Aleksandur Tomov 
from the Civic Alliance for the Republic also is a losing card. 
The same applies to Ludzhev's New Policy Center. Those are 
formations without supporters. 
  [Petrova] Did you register your party, and will you 
participate in the future elections? 
  [Gendzhev] Yes, the Democratic Party of Justice registered. 
Of course we will participate in the elections. We already are 
preparing -- we seek cadres and ascertain our possibilities. We 
are also preparing our program and are not making too much 
noise. It is too soon for this. We will probably participate 
in a coalition with other parties. For the time being I see 
only the Aleksandur Stamboliyski Bulgarian Agrarian National 
Union [BZNS] as a possible partner. This is the real BZNS which 
has structures. All the rest are hot air. I also rely very 
much on the intelligentsia, which now shuns politics. This is a 
potential force without leadership claims. It is a high time 
for an intelligent party to emerge. Such a party will not serve 
nationalism, but will protect Bulgaria's national interests 
instead. 
  [Petrova] It is well-known that you established a foundation 
which supports the religious life of Muslims in Bulgaria. How 
many mosques are under construction at present in Bulgaria? 
  [Gendzhev] I contributed $15,000 to the construction of the 
mosque in Madan. We contributed to rebuilding the burned-down 
mosque in Khaskovo, and to building mosques in Rudozem and 
Chepintsi. We are also building mosques in the Deliorman region 
-- I mean in the villages of Listets and Vulkan, and there are 
other construction projects. 
  I think that the most important factor is that even after 
the 
difficult period of 1985-86 we succeeded to preserve the respect 
between Muslims and Christians, as well as goodneighborly 
relations between Bulgarians and Turks. The attempts of certain 
persons to set the people against each other represent a crime. 
It is not serious to talk about some Islamic arcs and 
Panslavonic axes that cross Bulgaria. After all, the Bosnia 
Muslims also are Slavs! Our state must protect the tranquility 
in the country and prevent all attempts of inciting ethnic and 
religious feuds!

<F P=106> [Interview with Iraqi Minister of Agriculture Bashir 'Alwan </F>
Hammadi by Desislava Lilova; place and date not given: "Return 
to Iraqi Market Today, Tomorrow It Will Be Too Late"] 
  [Excerpts] [Lilova] Are you disturbed by the fact that 
the last official contacts between Bulgarian and Iraqi 
delegations were four years ago? 
  [Hammadi] Please allow me first to greet the friendly 
Bulgarian people, with whom we worked together for many years 
for the prosperity of our countries. Unfortunately, after the 
Gulf War the Bulgarian companies left Iraq and abandoned the 
construction sites they began. Now that those events are behind 
us we would like your companies to return and complete the 
construction projects. As you know, Iraq is exceptionally rich 
in resources. Our ambitions regarding the future are great and 
therefore the opportunities for our friends are substantial. 
  [Lilova] Does it mean that the Bulgarian construction 
projects have not been taken on by someone else? 
  [Hammadi] Yes, most of them stand as you left them. Only a 
few of them are being completed by Iraqi companies. 
  [Lilova] Could you say honestly until when Iraq will wait 
for Bulgaria to return to its construction projects? 
  [Hammadi] Frankly, we would like the Bulgarian companies to 
return today, before the embargo is lifted, because afterward 
everything will be easier and there will be pressure on the part 
of many candidates. The politicians know that an embargo is a 
temporary measures, while friends know that help counts when it 
is rendered at difficult times. 
  [Lilova] Iraq was one of the greatest markets for such 
important goods as weapons, meat, and medicines, which 
contributed much to our budget. Will you discuss with the 
Bulgarian side the manner of returning to your market? 
  [Hammadi] We still need your goods, especially the civilian 
ones. We will pose this issue and I hope that together we will 
find a mechanism that will allow you to export to Iraq. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Lilova] For four years, Bulgaria did not raise the issue of 
the $2 billion that you owe us. Will you discuss this issue now? 
  [Hammadi] We never denied the fact that we owe you, and when 
an Iraqi says something, it means that he will act accordingly. 
Iraq will not deny its obligations and will pay them back with 
oil. Bulgaria can be calm, its rights will be protected. It 
only is because of the circumstances that our debts to you were 
not eliminated by 1994. Indeed, you must know that for us this 
is not a great amount. 
  [Lilova] Do you not think that it is strange that the debtor 
is more interested in the deal than the creditor? 
  [Hammadi] We see the Bulgarians as friends. Those who love 
must also understand, help, and respect.

Imminent Danger From Russia"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Interior Ministry closely follows 
developments in Russia, but the present signs do not warrant any 
hasty response. Interior Ministry spokesman Subrt said this 
yesterday. It was his reply to the question of whether the 
Interior Ministry is preparing some measures after the comments 
by Vladimir Zhirinovkiy about an "entirely new regime" in Russia 
before the fall. According to Subrt, our side must wait for the 
official comments and conduct of the legitimate Russian 
Government. "We are all aware of Mr. Zhirinovkiy making very 
strong statements now and then," Subrt said and added that "at 
the moment, there is no threat."

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Eva </F>
Martinkova; place and date not given: "Prime Minister V. Klaus 
Answers LN"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Martinkova] In the context 
of the Hungarian elections, you declared the Czech Republic a 
little island in the sea of peculiar returns. How do you 
explain, however, that the Hungarian Socialists are promoting an 
economic policy similar to that of the Czech Government? Is 
there a difference between the left wing and the right wing in 
the declared stands or in specific economic measures? 
  [Klaus] I made a very balanced statement on the Hungarian 
elections. The cheap little joke was at the very end of this 
and, taken out of context, it acquired an inappropriate setting. 
I am far from assessing the outcome of the elections in Poland 
or Hungary in a simplified manner. The idea that it is a return 
of the communists is a jest that did not come to my mind. Their 
ideology is markedly different from the former communist 
ideology. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that they are 
parties from the left of the political spectrum. I have never 
had any serious doubts that these parties could implement a more 
or less balanced and reasonable economic policy. 
  On the other hand, I must say that, when I had the 
opportunity to meet with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian 
Socialists, at a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum 
last year, our visions of the world were infinitely different. 
His arguments reminded me of debates on the economic reform 
scenario with the adversaries of our economic strategy in 
1990-91. In this sense, it would be wrong to conceal the 
differences. The main thing is, however, that Hungary is and 
has been in all aspects a very close partner of ours. I am 
convinced that we will be able to cooperate with the new 
Hungarian Government just as effectively as we did with the 
previous governments, and I even believe that a certain sharp 
ethnic minority tone that was very strong in the previous 
Hungarian Government and that I have always feared a bit may, in 
this case, retreat into the background. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] An international seminar on security issues in 
Central and East Europe began in Prague today. Miroslav 
Konvalina has been following its proceedings in the Atrium Hotel: 
  [Konvalina] The opening speeches and early discussions 
indicate that deputies from East and West European countries, 
politicians, journalists, and other participants in the seminar 
are eager to get to know not only our positions on NATO and 
other European institutions, but also the changing policy of 
Russia, its self-confident actions on foreign and security 
issues and, in this context, ways of facing a possible change of 
Russian policy. 
  In the opening address at the seminar, Defense Minister 
Antonin Baudys analyzed security risks in present-day Europe. 
He said Russia is a volcano, whose lava of instability could 
spill far beyond the borders. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Bratinka noted that Russia has 
also received an offer to join the Partnership for Peace program 
and that, in the West, there is no country aspiring to threaten 
Russia. That is why our efforts aimed at gaining NATO 
membership are not motivated primarily by our fear of Russia, 
but by our endeavor to embody the values we have in common with 
West Europe in joint institutions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "jaf": "So Far, the Christian Democratic Party </F>
Does Not Intend To Criticize the Department of Justice"] 
  [Text] Prague--So far, the Christian Democratic Party 
[KDS] does not intend to specify its exceptions to the operation 
of the Department of Justice. According to KDS Deputy Chairman 
Vaclav Benda, it will do so after "all coalition mechanisms are 
exhausted," in the form of publishing a series of articles in 
the press. 
  The KDS deputy chairman also told DENNI TELEGRAF that the 
party leadership is interested "neither in the ministerial post 
nor in Minister Novak's head but, rather, in the correction of 
the situation in the department." According to the KDS, the 
remaining "coalition mechanisms" are discussions of its 
objections to the operation of the Ministry of Justice at the 
level of the coalition four. Another alternative is a meeting 
with Minister Novak on the ground of his deputies' club in the 
parliament. Benda considers the discussion in front of 
television cameras proposed by [Justice] Minister Novak another 
form of presentation of the aforementioned objections. "If none 
of these approaches leads to the correction, there is nothing 
left for the KDS and myself but to publicly point out the 
specific shortcomings that affect the interests of the general 
public," Benda said. To the question of whether the KDS has any 
hard evidence, he replied in the affirmative.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef </F>
Moravcik by Yves-Michel Riols and Martin Plichta in Bratislava; 
date not given: "Slovak Prime Minister Thinks `Balladur Plan 
Should Not Be Limited to Minorities Questions'"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--Jozef Moravcik, Bratislava 
government chief, is expected in Paris 16-17 May for his first 
visit to a European Union [EU] country since his investiture in 
March. In an interview with LE MONDE, he supports the idea of a 
Pact of Stability for Europe proposed by [French Prime Minister] 
Balladur but hopes that it will also become a springboard for 
the expansion of the EU to the former Socialist countries. 
[passage omitted] 
  Not enjoying the prestige of its Czech neighbor, easily 
identified with its charismatic President Vaclav Havel, Slovakia 
nonetheless demonstrated a reassuring responsibility during the 
political crisis at the beginning of the year that brought down 
Vladimir Meciar. Just two days after his departure, a broad 
coalition ranging from Catholic conservatives to former 
communists was formed under the leadership of Mr. Moravcik to 
lead the country to the parliamentary elections, which have been 
brought forward to September. "We have succeeded in calming the 
political debate," he said, "and we hope that the extremist 
factions will be gradually marginalized." 
<H5>  Man of Compromise </H5>
  One of the main issues in this easing of tension desired by 
Bratislava relates to the normalization of relations with 
neighboring Hungary. Since the fall of the communist regimes in 
these two countries, relations have deteriorated, especially 
through the controversy over the large Hungarian minority in 
Slovakia (600,000 people, 11 percent of the population). This 
controversy is at the heart of the concerns of the Stability 
Pact proposed by Mr. Balladur. And, in the run-up to the 
conference on this project in Paris on 26 and 27 May, Mr. 
Moravcik will come to explain to the French officials that he 
does not have either the Hungarians' sustained interest nor the 
Czechs' strong reservations toward this diplomatic initiative. 
  Faithful to his image as a man of compromise, the Slovak 
prime minister welcomes an initiative that "could provide a 
framework for the problem of minorities. And the solutions 
proposed could then be included in bilateral treaties." But 
this project, drawn up in the wake of the trauma created by the 
Yugoslav war, could not, in Jozef Moravcik's view, "be limited 
to just the question of minorities." He stressed that "the 
stability of the postcommunist countries also depends on their 
economic development and the future integration into the EU." 
In saying this, he was echoing a criticism that is increasingly 
heard among the Central European countries, which are irritated 
by the uncertainties surrounding the process of integration into 
the EU and by the Twelve's protectionism. This bitterness is 
particularly strong because East-West trade has been very 
imbalanced in favor of the EU since the end of communism. 
  Mr. Moravcik is therefore suggesting that the Stability Pact 
should go further than its initial framework and become "a 
positive contribution to the definition of a timetable and 
criteria making it possible for our countries to prepare for 
their integration into Europe." In other words, he is stressing 
that the states of Central Europe are perfectly aware that their 
rapprochement with the EU depends on a settlement of their 
historical disputes but that, by limiting itself to this one 
objective, the Balladur plan loses much of its justification. 
This is an argument that is also put forward by the Poles, who 
think they are no longer concerned by the Stability Pact because 
they have already concluded treaties of friendship with their 
neighbors, especially the Ukrainians and the Lithuanians. 
  With regard to the Hungarian-Slovak dispute, Mr. Moravcik 
hinted that Bratislava and Budapest can solve this problem 
themselves without the arbitration of a multilateral body. As a 
sign of this new desire for compromise, the Slovak Parliament 
adopted one of the Council of Europe's two recommendations 
relating to the use of Hungarian names in Slovakia at the end of 
April. And, on Tuesday, 10 May, Moravcik's government gave the 
go-ahead to the other recommendation on bilingual signs in the 
communes in which large numbers of Hungarians live. 
  In addition, the Socialists and the Liberals, who were in 
the 
lead after the first round of parliamentary elections in 
Hungary, have several times expressed their desire to reach a 
"historic reconciliation" with the neighboring countries. "The 
improvement in our relations with Hungary is one of our 
priorities," the head of the Slovak Government stressed. "We 
want to conclude a bilateral treaty as quickly as possible." 
  The atmosphere is now clearly more favorable to easing 
tension. But the main obstacle still has to be overcome: 
recognition of the inviolability of borders. This is a clause 
that Hungary has so far always refused to include in a treaty 
with Slovakia and Romania, arguing that such a pledge had 
already been given in the framework of the 1947 Paris Treaty and 
the 1975 Helsinki Agreements. Before envisaging such a 
declaration on borders, Budapest wants to secure guarantees on 
the rights of the Hungarian minorities in these two countries. 
Even though the rapid conclusion of this dispute seems 
difficult, there is nonetheless a concern to create a new 
climate of confidence. 
  Jozef Moravcik therefore wants to initiate an "impetus for 
peace" that is sufficiently strong to withstand electoral 
changes. Indeed, there is nothing to say that his government 
will still be at the helm after the September parliamentary 
elections. The opinion polls are still giving the lead to 
Vladimir Meciar.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F>
Horn by correspondent Jozsef Laszlo; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Laszlo] [passage omitted] Last week new and 
controversial details emerged about your accident. How do you 
remember it now, more than a week after your accident? What 
actually happened? 
  [Horn] I told the police that we were traveling at about 90 
km an hour. I know this precisely, because we were joking about 
it just before the accident. I saw a flash in front of us on 
the road but I do not remember anything more because the driver 
swerved and we crashed. It is a fact that the truck did not 
have any lights on; it is a fact that there was nobody in front 
of us to overtake and that the road was completely dry. Thus 
the circumstances would have been right -- barring something 
untoward -- for us to avoid this stupid accident. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Laszlo] The question arises whether you will accept the 
nomination for prime minister. 
  [Horn] Well, look, it depends on my party's decision. We 
decided, and it was adopted by the congress at the end of 
February, that once the coalition negotiations are completed, a 
special congress will make the final decision in personnel 
matters. If this body, by expressing the opinion of the 
membership, decides that Gyula Horn is suitable for this task, 
naturally, I will not run away from the responsibility. I will 
accept the responsibility. [passage omitted] 
  The important thing is that the future economic 
decisionmakers in the cabinet should have total power. What 
went on here for four years -- when the leader of the economic 
decisionmaking body was changed nearly every year -- was 
untenable. However, before anyone can accuse me of pushing my 
party's interests, let me tell you that I have never volunteered 
for any post; I was always asked. If the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP] wins the elections and decides to nominate me for 
prime minister, naturally I will say yes. If not, it is not the 
end of the world for me. 
  [Laszlo] [passage omitted] The press reported earlier that 
the MSZP might be willing not only to form a coalition with the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], but perhaps also with the 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] or the Christian 
Democrats. What is the situation now? 
  [Horn] There are no coalition negotiations under way with 
any 
party. I have to add, of course, that a kind of preliminary 
consultation is under way. [passage omitted] We are open to 
the SZDSZ. Naturally, this openness could decrease if a certain 
tone or style got the upper hand within the SZDSZ, which we 
would not be pleased to see. 
  As for Fidesz, well, it suffered a serious loss in the 
elections. Unfortunately, the style of statements made by some 
Fidesz leaders during the election campaign sometimes resembled 
the extreme right. Under these circumstances it would be very 
difficult for the MSZP to achieve an agreement with 
representatives of this style. 
  Regarding the Christian Democrats, we said at the end of 
February that we are ready to cooperate with the Christian 
Democratic People's Party, to be precise, if it sheds its 
extremist tendencies. Well, I do not see many signs of this 
being done. 
  [Laszlo] MSZP leaders have often said that they do not wish 
to conduct any kind of spring cleaning -- either on a large 
scale or a small scale. How do you envision the running of 
offices in the next tenure of government? 
  [Horn] The prime minister and the political state 
secretaries 
have to go when there is a change of government. As to whether 
the administrative state secretaries will go or stay, in my mind 
this is up to a personal and subjective decision. In the case 
of the deputy state secretaries, their professional performance 
has to be examined. These will be our guiding principles if we 
are in this position. To my mind there are very many who worked 
very well in the past four years. 
  [Laszlo] How do you envision the oft-mentioned social 
consensus or agreement, in which employers, employees, and 
politics would all participate? 
  [Horn] We have issued a letter of intent regarding the 
organization of an economic and social agreement. The goal is 
to create an agreement between the government and the interest 
protection organizations of the employers and employees, but not 
only on social issues. For example, the reform of the budget 
must be started by all means, that is, the reform of the 
large-scale system of distribution. 
  There is a need for a new privatization practice or policy. 
The opportunity must be created for a new modernization 
program, that is, over and above privatization something real 
and genuine should take place in the modernization of the 
economy. Because, contrary to all other talks, one of the facts 
of the past four years is: first, modernization has not begun in 
the economy. Second, productivity has declined. The recovery 
of Hungarian agriculture and currency can be considered a 
national issue. Naturally, on the issues of income, taxation, 
social security, and the health service, agreement must be 
reached in the most concrete manner, in writing and in public. 
For in the next period everything must be done in public. 
  There is a need for the greatest degree of self-restraint on 
behalf of every participant in social and political public life. 
For nobody can produce a miracle here. It is impossible to 
raise the standard of living suddenly from nothing and to 
improve social services. However, improvement can be achieved 
by a much better and much fairer distribution system. 
  [Laszlo] The party faced accusations earlier that a certain 
section of the party is inclined to initiate some sort of 
restoration. These accusations can still be heard today. 
  [Horn] The MSZP does not want any kind of restoration, for 
example renationalization. Our goal and basic philosophy is to 
create a social market economy and a market economy cannot be 
built without a considerable proportion of private ownership. 
  The newly and legally acquired property of new owners must 
not be touched. Just as the church properties must not be 
touched either. Compensation: We were against it in parliament, 
but now we want to finish it. We want to complete it. What the 
previous government and parliament pledged must be completed. 
However, it must be finished as soon as possible, as early as 
in 1995. There is no chance for any kind of restoration, for 
anybody who contemplates this is bound to be defeated and we do 
not want to be defeated but to succeed.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly Speaker Miro Lazovic 
said today that the Assembly of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Assembly of the Bosnian-Croat 
federation were going to share their work. I expect the 
Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to meet. 
According to the Constitution, it should take up the duties of 
the federation's assembly with the proviso that at that session, 
duties will be divided into two categories -- tasks covered by 
the republic's Assembly and those relating to the future 
federation. 
  I believe that -- if political agreement is reached -- it 
will be possible to appoint top-level officials of the future 
federation. Some issues relating to the Assembly of the Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina will also be examined, Lazovic said at a 
news conference in Zagreb. The news conference was organized by 
a delegation of the Serb Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Miro Lazovic is its member. He stressed that in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina parliament there are deputies who had been 
elected in the 1990 elections. He said he expected Croatian 
Democratic Community [HDZ] deputies to come and take part in the 
assembly's work -- in their capacity as representatives of a 
party that contested the 1990 elections rather than as 
representatives of Herceg-Bosna. 
  Lazovic pointed out that the federal concept outlined in the 
Washington agreement should be extended to the whole of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We believe that this is a concept that 
suits the Bosnian Serbs, too, as they are the second largest 
population group in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If this concept is not 
accepted, a huge number of the Serbs who stay to live in the 
territory of the Croat-Bosnian federation will fall into the 
category of other peoples, although they will account for almost 
the same percentage as the Croats.

  [Text] After visiting Russian troops serving with the UN 
Protection Forces in Sector East, Russian Ambassador to Croatia 
Leonid Kerestedziyants told reporters that they discussed the 
implementation of the Zagreb agreement and agreed that the 
Croatian Army must withdraw the remaining weapons by 1600 
tomorrow and the Serbian side must do the same by 2400 tomorrow. 
  The Zagreb agreement has to be fully implemented in all 
protected areas by 2400 tomorrow, the Russian ambassador said. 
If this does not happen further steps will be taken by both the 
Russian and U.S. embassies and the European Union, for what has 
been signed has to be respected. This is not a piece of paper 
which has been signed and can then be forgotten, he said.

  [Text] Deputies of the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] from 
both chambers of the Croatian Assembly held a session of their 
club today. These are excerpts of a statement containing the 
reaction of the HDZ deputies to a letter sent by Josip Manolic 
and Stipe Mesic, the presidents of the Assembly's chambers of 
counties and deputies, to the U.S. Congress on 4 May this year. 
  The HDZ deputies say that this is an unprecedented act in 
Croatian political history and they therefore unanimously 
condemn such an unheard-of act. Abusing and usurping their 
official posts of president of the Croatian Assembly and 
president of the Chamber of Counties, Stipe Mesic and Josip 
Manolic, without any consent of the assembly, of their own 
accord sent the above-mentioned letter to members of the U.S. 
Congress, monstrously slandering their own state institutions in 
which they were duty-bound to protect the Constitution and laws. 
  In their condemnation, they go so far as to equate the 
heroic 
struggle of defense and liberation by the Croatian people for 
freedom and independence with the imperialistic, fascist, 
chetnik, aggressive regime of the greater Serbia of Slobodan 
Milosevic. By this they even want to suggest that the top 
Croatian officials should be charged with instigating the 
aggression. 
  Despite huge efforts and the successes of the Croatian 
president and the Croatian Government and assembly in the 
implementation of the Washington agreement, the creation of the 
federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the historic agreement 
between the Croats and the Muslims, Manolic and Mesic 
fraudulently and completely unfoundedly condemn the entire 
Croatian authorities and state policy of undermining the 
Washington agreement, and call on the United States to overturn 
the legitimate Croatian Government and replace it with another 
government, which would not be an expression of the political 
will of the Croatian Assembly. 
  The HDZ deputies in the assembly's Chambers of Deputies and 
Counties most vehemently condemn the defamation, lies, 
intrigues, and insinuations by Manolic and Mesic, which may have 
far-reaching and destructive consequences for the survival of 
the Croatian state and the freedom of the Croatian people.

  [Text] Mirko Pejanovic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, and Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly Chairman Miro 
Lazovic held talks today in Zagreb with Croatian Assembly 
Chairman Stipe Mesic. The main topic was how to preserve an 
integral Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nada al-Isa reports on these talks: 
  [Begin al-Isa recording] Stipe Mesic listened with pleasure 
to the information provided him by Messrs. Pejanovic and Lazovic 
after their return from Moscow, where they went as members of 
the Serbian Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They stressed 
that they had held talks in Moscow with Vitaliy Churkin, who 
said for the first time that Russia, too, wanted to preserve the 
territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He openly said 
that he no longer trusted Karadzic. 
  Pejanovic and Lazovic discussed Croatian-Muslim relations, 
that is, the future federation, with Stipe Mesic. Messrs. 
Lazovic and Pejanovic addressed the same issues at today's news 
conference in Zagreb. In order to help improve relations 
between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Stipe Mesic accepted the invitation by 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly Chairman Miro Lazovic to visit 
Sarajevo soon. He will come, he said, as soon as this week's 
assembly session was over. 
  As is known, the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] has 
been 
announcing that it will seek Mesic's removal at the session. 
However, Mesic says: I will remain the chairman of the assembly 
even after the session. They will not manage to remove me, even 
though they are hoping to. Mesic revealed specially for Radio 
Television Bosnia-Herzegovina the latest news from the Croatian 
political scene, which, by the way, has still not been announced 
in Zagreb. The entire Zagreb county, the largest one in Croatia 
and politically the most attractive, has left the HDZ and joined 
Mesic's Party of Independent Croatian Democrats [HND]. Mesic 
says that, because of that, many HDZ members in Zagreb will not 
be able to sleep tonight. 
  Finally, Stipe Mesic told the Sarelians that he will come 
and 
visit them very soon, in his position as assembly chairman -- he 
claims -- and he does not believe in the rumors that the UN 
Protection Force [UNPROFOR] is creating transportation problems 
from Zagreb to Sarajevo, as some claim in the presidential 
quarters in Zagreb. [end recording]

  [Text] Warsaw, 16 May (PAP)--An intergovernmental agreement 
on "cooperation and exchange of information on some issues 
concerning defense" was signed today by Swedish Defense Minister 
Anders Bjorck and Poland's National Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk. 
  Poland is the first country of the East bloc with which 
Sweden has signed such an agreement. Minister Bjorck pointed 
out that this transpires from the fact that Poland stands "in 
the forefront of the states of this part of Europe that have 
carried out democratic changes." 
  So far, Poland has signed 21 agreements on military 
cooperation, among others, with all of its neighbors.

  [Text] New York, May 16 (TANJUG) -- NATO planes are 
ignoring earlier warnings and continue provoking and violating 
the Yugoslav air space, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic said in a letter to the U.N. secretary general. A 
NATO reconaissance plane and a bomber violated the Yugoslav air 
space on April 24 in the region of the Perucanlake, western part 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, while similar incidents 
have become an increasing practice, Jovanovic said in the letter 
which was published as an official U.N. document on Monday. 
Jovanovic also warned that NATO aircraft frequently break the 
sound barrier over the rural regions of the Bosnian Serb 
republic (RS) in order to frighten the local population. 
  According to the Yugoslav foreign minister, these incidents 
are the more concerning because the United Nations failed to 
react to earlier Yugoslav warnings and take corresponding steps 
with the NATO command. The continuing provocations and 
violations of the Yugoslav air space pose a serious threat to 
peace and security in the entire region the flagrant violation 
[words indistinct] territorial integrity and sovereignty and a 
direct threat to the peace process which aims to halt the war in 
the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina, Jovanovic said. 
  I call on you once again to take the corresponding steps 
within the U.N. and in the NATO command to end the dangerous 
provocations, he said. 
  In October 1992 the U.N. Security Council adopted a 
resolution imposing a no-fly zone over Bosnia. Its 
implementation is monitored by the NATO air force.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, May 16 (TANJUG) -- The European Union's 
Ministerial Council on Monday endorsed in full the plan for 
Bosnia put forth by Western and Russian foreign ministers at 
Geneva last week. The foreign ministers of Russia, the United 
States, Great Britain, France and the European Union's "troika" 
(Belgium, Greece, Germany), meeting in Geneva on Friday, invited 
Bosnia's warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats to agree to a 
four-month ceasefire during which to negotiate a peace 
settlement on the basis of an E.U. territory-sharing plan which 
envisages for giving the Moslems and Croats 51 percent of the 
territory in which to form their federation, and the Serbs the 
remaining 49 percent. 
  The chairman of the Monday council session, Greek European 
Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos, confirmed at a press 
conference this evening that the E.U. foreign ministers had 
endorsed the recommended division of Bosnian territory. 
  He said that inasmuch as the Geneva plan was implemented, 
the 
easing would begin of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro 
(Yugoslavia). His use of the term easing rather than the usual 
suspension of the sanctions has not gone unnoticed. The 
sanctions were voted in place by the U.N. Security Council in 
May 1992 in retaliation for Yugoslavia's alleged involvement in 
civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Asked by TANJUG's correspondent what instruments were being 
envisaged for endorcing the plan, more specifically if all the 
Bosnian warring nations were expected to comply with the same 
requirements, Pangalos said that no accord could be reached 
without all the sides agreeing. 
  Asked further by the same correspondent if this meant that 
the same side should again be permitted to back out of this 
latest agreement at the last moment on a new pretext with 
impunity, as every time before, Pangalos answered by shrugging 
his shoulders. Bosnian Moslems have so far rejected several 
peace plans, opting instead for war. 
  The Greek minister said that the contact group for Bosnia 
had 
already taken steps to draft maps and bring the belligerents to 
the conference table. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, speaking at a 
separate press conference, said that the twelve ministers had 
clearly and unequivocally backed the Geneva plan. Asked by the 
GUARDIAN's correspondent John Palmer, who poses in Brussels as a 
lobbyist for the Moslem cause, if this meant rewarding the Serb 
"ethnic cleansing" in the way in which Hitler had been rewarded 
with Czechoslovakia, Douglas Hurd replied he could not 
understand the idea behind the question, explaining that the 
Geneva plan envisaged for Bosnia to remain within its existing 
borders, and for the Serbs to make the biggest territorial 
concessions. 
  Bosnian Serbs, who own 64 percent of the land in Bosnia 
according to the land books and currently control about 70 
percent of the territory, have indicated in talks to date their 
willingness to make certain territorial concessions.

  [Text] Over the past four years, there has been a drastic 
drop in trade union membership in the Czech Republic. Of the 
initial 92 percent, membership has dropped to the present 36 
percent. Only 22 percent of the work force employed in private 
companies are trade union members, said Jaroslav Strait, 
chairman of the Trade Unions Association of Bohemia, Moravia, 
and Silesia. He said that the current trend in the development 
of the trade union movement is worrying. What is disappearing 
is not only trade unions but also ordinary human solidarity, 
Strait said, adding that the pressure the state exerts on the 
social and economic rights of the people has strongly 
intensified and that ever tougher standards are asked for. 
  Strait said that all of this is happening with the help of 
the Czech-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions. He branded this 
organization as a government-run trade union.

  [Text] Overall consumer prices, expressing the 
inflationary development, rose by 0.4 percent in April in 
comparison with the preceding month. Czech Statistical Office 
Spokesman J. Lehnerova announced this yesterday. 
  Prices of services, food, and nonfood products each 
increased 
by the same 0.4 percent. Public catering prices recorded the 
greatest increase in April--0.6 percent. Among food products, 
chocolate and sweets showed the largest increase--2.8 to 5.5 
percent. On the other hand, the price of eggs fell by 5.3 
percent. Among the services, cinema and theater seats and 
municipal transport fares rose by more than 2 percent. 
  Total inflation over the four months of this year reached 
2.8 
percent and thus corresponds to government expectations and the 
Czech National Bank's estimates. The annual level of inflation 
is declining as the year progresses. It was 9.2 percent in 
April, down 0.2 percent from March.

  [Text] Washington--Branislav Lichardus, ambassador of the 
Slovak Republic to the United States, reacted to a report on 
media freedom issued by the Freedom House organization, in which 
Slovakia is included among "partially free countries." In a 
letter to the director of the Freedom Forum foundation, which 
sponsored the drafting of the report, he wrote: "I read the 
report on the freedom of media in Slovakia and have serious 
doubts about its objectivity. I was unpleasantly surprised that 
Slovakia is rated as a `partially free country," while the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, and Poland are included among countries with 
`free media.' I do not know the circumstances that made you 
come up with such an assessment, but I want to assure you that, 
according to the principles of the Charter of the Free Press, 
Slovakia meets all of the conditions of an open society with a 
free press and should be included among countries with such a 
rating."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Against Attacks on the Independence </F>
of the Mass Media"] 
  [Text] The Association of Slovak Journalists [ZSN], which 
represents 700 members, is alarmed at the current situation, in 
which the democracy and plurality of the mass media in Slovakia 
are endangered. Despite the constitutional guarantees of the 
freedom of the press and speech and the law on the independence 
and impartiality of Slovak Television [STV], the decision 
adopted by the coalition deputies to recall the STV Council is a 
gross violation of these legal guarantees. The ZSN points out 
to our and the world public that the current parliamentary and 
government practice of implementing the party principle is 
threatening the independence of the mass media. The coalition 
political parties, which have a majority in parliament, are, by 
their conduct, ignoring the Charter on Human Rights and Freedoms 
and the Council of Europe resolutions concerning the mass media, 
especially Resolution No. 428/1970 on the mass media and human 
rights, which emphasizes the media's independence of political 
supervision, and Council of Europe Recommendation No. 1147/1993 
concerning the responsibility of parliaments for the democratic 
reform of radio and television broadcasting in the countries of 
Central Europe. We are alarmed by the silence of the democratic 
press in Western countries over the totalization of political 
life in Slovakia, the practices of political purges, and the 
regression to communist normalization by the former entities of 
the communist party that are today operating within groupings 
throughout the political spectrum of the coalition. The ZSN 
appeals to the entire Slovak journalistic community and to 
professional journalistic organizations at home and abroad for 
professional solidarity in defending professional and civil 
rights. 
<H5>  From the Point of View of the Slovak National Party: Who </H5>
Will Be Next? 
  The Slovak National Party [SNS] states that the recall of a 
substantial part of the Slovak Television Council was carried 
out on the basis of unconfirmed speculation and unverified 
documents. It is more than certain that the main reason for the 
recall is the feeling of a lack of control over STV on the part 
of the provisional government coalition because the council had 
been nominated by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the 
SNS, although none of its members were members of any party or 
movement. This was not a matter-of-fact issue, but a purely 
political decision. This is also borne out by the fact that the 
coalition's representative, when presenting the proposal for the 
recall, used an argument that turned out to be erroneous in 
relation to the materials the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic [NR SR] deputies had at their disposal--that is, on the 
issue of the STV Council's Statute. The ruling coalition did 
not make even the slightest attempt to find a real reason for 
recalling the STV Council; the vote was held immediately. The 
SNS feels that what happened in the NR SR during the recall of 
the STV Council can only be described as a display of arrogance 
by the current ruling authority and the ruling coalition 
grouping in parliament. It is necessary to ask once again what 
or who will be next.

<F P=106> [Article by "so": "Government Approved Bill on Bilingual </F>
Signs"] 
  [Excerpt] Bratislava--[passage omitted] At its meeting 
yesterday, the government agreed with the proposal submitted by 
a group of deputies to amend the law on elections to the Slovak 
National Council. The draft amendment does not change the basic 
principles of the existing legislation governing elections to 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic--the electoral 
system and the size and number of constituencies remain 
unchanged. The proposed amendment mainly clarifies provisions 
pertaining to the organization of elections. According to the 
draft, voters will receive the ballots at the polling 
stations--that is, the ballots will not be delivered to their 
homes. A citizen of the Slovak Republic who is not a permanent 
resident of the Slovak Republic will be entered in the voters' 
register on entering the polling station by the district 
electoral commission, and the commission will record this entry 
in the voter's travel document. When casting the ballot, the 
voter must have his citizenship recorded in his identity papers.

  [Summary] According to an opinion poll carried out by 
Slovak Radio in May to find out current voting intentions, and 
based on the answers from 1,065 respondents, the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] polled 21.1 percent, the Party of the 
Democratic Left [SDL] polled 8.7 percent, and the Christian 
Democratic Movement [KDH] polled 7.9 percent of votes. The 
other parties failed to reach 5 percent of votes and would not 
therefore be represented in parliament. 
  The respondents also answered the question about how would 
they vote if parties and movements were grouped in coalitions. 
The coalition of national oriented parties--the HZDS, the 
Slovak National Party, and the Christian Social Union--would win 
1999 percent of votes. The coalition of left-wing parties--the 
SDL, the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party, and the 
Farmers' Movement--would win 15.1 percent of votes. And the 
coalition of right-wing and liberal parties--the KDH, the 
Democratic Party, the National Democratic Party, the Democratic 
Union, and the Party of Entrepreneurs and Small 
Businessmen--would win 13 percent of votes. The coalition of 
Hungarian parties received the support of 7.5 percent of 
respondents.

<F P=106> [Interview with Augustin Marian Huska, deputy chairman of </F>
the National Council of the Slovak Republic and deputy chairman 
of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, by Drahoslav Machala; 
place and date not given: "Europe Is Favorably Disposed Toward 
Slovakia, but Ill-Wishers Are Also To Be Found"] 
  [Excerpt] [Machala] You have just returned from talks in 
the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The talks had a formal 
but also an informal part. Did you learn anything of interest 
for Slovakia? 
  [Huska] We have obtained information that is impossible to 
obtain under normal circumstances. Unfortunately, we must 
self-critically acknowledge that Slovakia does not have enough 
politicians of a statesmanlike nature. This is a result of the 
fact that it was the object rather than the subject of its own 
history for too long. 
  I would like to alert those who so enthusiastically welcome 
the victory of the Hungarian Socialist Party and expect some 
"new" accommodating steps from it to the fact that, speaking in 
Heidelberg in mid-March 1994, Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman 
Gyula Horn deliberately and unfavorably referred to Slovakia as 
"a country that belongs not to Central Europe but to the 
Balkans." Some left-wing politicians in Slovakia present Horn 
as a possibly more acceptable alternative for the improvement of 
Slovak-Hungarian relations. We must quickly get rid of this 
illusion. Any Hungarian politician, irrespective of his "faith" 
and political orientation, whether he be a conservative, a 
socialist, or a liberal, will promote in his practical policy 
the selfish, solely Hungarian geopolitical interests. I am 
drawing attention to this now so that, because of the proverbial 
Slovak propensity to make concessions, we do not let ourselves 
be hoodwinked by the honey-sweet statements of Hungarian 
politicians. It is naive to believe that a 
Warsaw-Bratislava-Budapest "socialist axis" might be some kind 
of a rescue for the Slovak Republic. This is not a solution for 
the state or national interest of the Slovak Republic. 
Defending the territorial integrity of the Slovak Republic 
against external pressures must remain our primary interest.

<F P=106> [Report by Coriolan Hancu: "If the Greater Romania Party </F>
Leader Is Not in Prison in 1996, He Will Run for the Presidency"] 
  [Text] Today will be a difficult day for Ilie Verdet, 
chairman of the PSM [Socialist Party of Labor]. This is because 
during today's news conference by his socialist, former 
nomenclature, comrades he might be subjected to an avalanche of 
questions reminding the PSM leader that not so long ago -- at 
the time when the Tudor Mohora-Adrian Paunescu duel had not yet 
been won by the latter -- he had stated: "There is no such 
thing as a National Bloc and I will conclude no agreements with 
Corneliu Vadim Tudor [chairman of the Greater Romania Party -- 
PRM]." 
  Among other things, the secret pact concluded last week by 
the two parties, which consecrated the defeat of the Mohora 
faction and caused dissatisfaction among the members of the two 
parties, also comprises a joint project intended for the future: 
According to this, PSM and PRM should support a joint candidate 
in the next presidential elections, a person that conforms with 
the interests of both parties. The leaders of PSM and PRM 
concluded that pact, hoping that in Romania, in the same way as 
in Poland and more recently in Hungary, the possible early 
elections will be won by the Communists, that is, by them, 
because the ideologies of the parties they lead are parts of the 
red doctrine. However, Ilie Verdet and Corneliu Vadim Tudor 
seem to ignore the fact that so far Romania has been run solely 
by the former nomenclature. 
  Regarding the candidate to the presidency the two parties 
envisaged for the 1996 presidential elections, he is, according 
to rumors, none other than the "tribune" himself [Corneliu Vadim 
Tudor]. Of course, only if by the time the elections are held 
he is still at large (he currently faces a total of 
approximately 200 legal suits.) 
  However, the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] will 
certainly take all necessary measures to ensure that when the 
time comes, the Communists all over the country should favor one 
candidate alone to the supreme office in the state, namely Ion 
Iliescu.

  [Text] We received by fax the following communique from 
the Constitutional Court: 
  Today the plenary meeting of the Constitutional Court 
discussed and pronounced on the constitutionality of the 
following laws: 
  Law on the Organization and Functioning of the Romanian 
Radio 
Broadcasting Company and the Romanian Television Company: 
Noting that the provisions of Article 52, Paragraph 2 of the 
law run counter to the constitutional regime of control exerted 
by Parliament on the public administration -- since they ignore 
the preparatory nature of the activity carried out by the 
parliamentary commissions, in their capacity as working bodies 
of the chambers to which they belong -- the Constitutional Court 
declared these provisions as unconstitutional. 
  Law on the Agricultural Income Tax: The Constitutional Court 
noted that the dispositions of Article 22 of the law, which are 
to become valid as of 1994, are unconstitutional, since they 
violate the constitutional principle of the retroactive nature 
of the law. Consequently, it was decided that, within the 
procedure of reexamining the law, one should correlate the 
deadlines envisaged by Article 5 and Article 9 of the law with 
the actual date of the law's validation, in case Parliament 
decides that the law should be implemented this year. Regarding 
the uncultivated fields referred to in Article 2, Paragraph 2 of 
the law, the text was declared constitutional only to the extent 
that it does not apply to uncultivable fields. The stipulations 
of Article 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, and Article 16 of the same 
law were declared constitutional. 
  Law on War Veterans and Certain Rights of War Invalids and 
Widows: In view of the provisions of Article 16 Paragraph 1 of 
the Constitution regarding the equal rights of citizens, the 
Court declared Article 2, Letter B -- dealing with the 
requirement that the claimant should not have fought against the 
Romanian Army -- as unconstitutional, since the recruiting and 
mobilization of the individuals mentioned by the text of the law 
were compulsorily done in the Romanian territories temporarily 
occupied during the 1940-1945 period. By virtue of the same 
principle of all the country's citizens being equal before the 
law, the Constitutional Court declared Article 2, Letters A and 
C as well as Article 7, Letter B, Thesis 1 -- which define the 
quality as war veteran -- as unconstitutional. 
  In the same session, the Constitutional Court put the final 
touches to the examination of the constitutionality of the rules 
of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate and pointed out the 
provisions that run counter to the Constitution. After the 
Court's decisions are edited, they will be published in 
MONITORUL OFICIAL, Part 1.

<F P=106> [Speech by European Parliament President Egon Klepsch to a </F>
joint session of the Romanian Parliament in Bucharest on 17 May 
-- live; Klepsch speaks in English with simultaneous translation 
into Romanian] 
  [Text] President of the Senate, President of the Chamber 
of Deputies, members of both houses of the Romanian Parliament, 
ladies and gentlemen: 
  It is a great honor and pleasure for me to be able to be 
here 
with you on the occasion of my official visit to Romania. On 
behalf of all my colleagues in the European Parliament, I thank 
you most warmly for your invitation. When I assumed my function 
as president of the European Parliament in January 1992 I knew 
that it would be impossible during my two and a half years 
mandate to visit all the countries with which the European Union 
enjoys positive European links. Nevertheless, I was determined 
to visit Romania. The European Parliament follows closely the 
relations with all countries neighboring the European Union and 
mainly those in Central and East Europe. Romania is no 
exception. Since the crucial events of 1989 and 1990 the policy 
of the countries in the European Union and the efforts of their 
governments and parliaments and especially of the European 
Parliament have been directed toward establishing and building a 
new political and economic structure in Central and Eastern 
Europe, the Baltic countries, and the CIS. 
  Developing, improving, and deepening economic and trade 
relations between the European Union and these countries has 
acquired a particular importance in 1994. On their part, the 
countries that were previously locked under Soviet domination in 
the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] and the Warsaw 
Pact now have the freedom to devote all their efforts to 
confront the challenges that the current situation presents. 
The architecture of East-West relations are generally 
characterized by a new spirit of cooperation. The days of 
isolation, confrontation, and mistrust are over. There is a 
determined political will of both sides to create relations 
based on friendship, partnership, and mutual respect. I hardly 
need to remind Romania, of all countries, how difficult and 
painful is the transition from the communist regime to a 
peaceful multiparty democracy and from decades of planned 
economy to a social market economy. This takes time, much 
patience, and great efforts. 
  Romania in particular is confronted with great challenges 
and 
tries to implement reforms and at the same time to take care of 
the painful legacy of the past and the current social and 
political realities. 
  The progress you have already made, in spite of all 
obstacles, deserves recognition and respect. The progress that 
you have yet to make deserves our understanding, support, and 
encouragement. This is why I said that I believed that it is 
important for me to come here to Romania, learn about your 
preoccupations first hand, and assure you of the European 
Parliament's continuous support for your efforts to try and take 
your rightful, integrated place in the European family. 
  Your history is European and I am convinced that Romania's 
future is also linked to Europe. I am equally convinced that 
Romania and its people wish to confront challenges and wish to 
attain their goals. On its part, the European Union has 
recognized that it must find appropriate ways and means to help 
bring the European countries closer together in a broader 
association. This is where association agreements intervene. 
The association agreement signed between Romania and the 
European Union is a significant step in the right direction. 
Its realistic aim is to offer realistic assistance and support 
for the future, which is necessary for restructuring and which 
enables the creation of conditions for full integration. 
  Over and above economic and trade policy aspects, the 
European accord has a new special characteristic that is mainly 
a political accord and dialogue on several issues. It supports 
the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights that 
each country that wishes to be associated closely to the Europe 
must pledge to respect. The European Parliament takes its 
responsibility and its role very seriously as far as 
restructuring of relations with the European Union and with the 
countries in the Central and Eastern Europe are concerned. As 
far as all the accords concluded with Central and Eastern Europe 
are concerned, we have made a very close and critical assessment 
of the results of relations between the European Commission and 
Romania. After a thorough debate and a serious assessment, we 
approved the European accord with a great majority, while being 
perfectly aware of the implications. 
  Our parliament was the first parliament of the European 
Union 
which ratified the agreement with Romania. Since then, we put 
pressure on other parliaments in Europe as well, to follow our 
example. Delays in the ratification can only hinder those who 
must support this agreement. All European agreements mean much 
more than trade and financial assistance, no matter how 
important these aspects are. Full association also involves 
cooperation at social, political, and cultural levels. In this 
respect, the European Parliament grants special attention to its 
formal and informal relations with the parliaments of the 
countries in question. We look forward to achieving the 
establishment of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that is 
stipulated in the association agreement with Romania. Following 
one of the existing European delegations [words indistinct] in 
relations with Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania, I am sure that 
this new structure will offer an extremely valuable forum for 
continuous discussions and for an increased mutual 
understandings between the two parliaments. The integration 
process [words indistinct], a strong European Union from the 
economic and political point of view, will be able to offer the 
countries in Central and East Europe the support that they need 
in order to achieve long-term economic stability and political 
security. 
  The European Union has its own internal difficulties which 
generally appear on the road of a stronger integration. In 
spite of these internal problems that we have, to be a full 
member is an attractive proposal for those outside of it. On 
its part, the European Parliament has consistently spoken out 
for enlargement. This month, in our last session that we had 
before the European elections, we took a historical step, we 
cast a vote in favor of enlargement of the Union in order to 
include our friends from Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria. 
This was a vote that confirmed the capacity of the European 
Parliament to answer with significant responsibility all the 
membership applications. Likewise, it confirmed our sincere 
commitment toward the principle of enlargement. At the same 
time, the European Parliament welcomed the decision taken by the 
Council of Europe on 22 June 1993 in Copenhagen, where the heads 
of state and governments showed the possibility for 
participation in the European Union of those countries in 
Central and Eastern Europe that signed or will sign association 
agreements. Provided that certain conditions are fulfilled and 
the progress the Parliament asked for reported, we see that 
there is a possibility for a further enlargement, which is an 
positive act and which consolidates the European Union. 
  The guiding principle in the geographic expansion of the 
Union should be accompanied by a corresponding process of 
establishing especially fundamental institutions. In order to 
be eligible for membership, those who submit the request have to 
fulfill a number of fundamental conditions, which are the 
following: a state based on freedom and the rule of law, a 
pluralistic democracy, a functioning social market economy, and 
the willingness to give up sovereignty [as heard]. In addition 
to these four basic fundamental preconditions, the following 
conditions are also necessary: adoption in full of the [words 
indistinct] the existing body of the community legislation, 
which came into force through the Rome treaty and [word 
indistinct] and adherence to the Maastricht treaty and all its 
objectives, which also includes the political goals of the 
treaty. 
  History has taught us that the road forward must be through 
cooperation and integration and not through confrontation and 
separation. It is completely in our interest to cooperate with 
those who share our fundamental values of democracy, tolerance, 
and mutual respect. We should build structures that will allow 
us to achieve our joint goals, long term peace, and prosperity. 
  Reaching the necessary agreements for stability with Central 
and Eastern Europe and Russia and the other countries in the 
CIS, Baltic states, and the Balkans is a precondition to create 
a new, broad European security structure. Only if we achieve 
this objective will it be possible to ensure that crises and 
wars like the one in the former Yugoslavia will not happen again. 
  Our Parliament has welcomed the initiative taken by the 
heads 
of states and governments to move toward a European agreement 
regarding stability in Europe. The goal is to prevent tension 
and potential conflicts in Europe, to consolidate borders, and 
solve the problems of minorities in a spirit of tolerance and 
cooperation. 
  Romania occupies a particularly sensitive geographical and 
strategic position, which is far from stable. Because of this, 
you have suffered directly from the negative economic effects of 
the terrible conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Also due to its 
position, your country could make a significant contribution to 
stability and peace in this region. Therefore, we noted in 
connection with Romania that it was the first of many countries 
that decided to accept Partnership for Peace made by the NATO 
and the Western Alliance at its January meeting. The engagement 
of Romania in this respect is clear and I congratulate you on 
it. The current conflicts in Europe and in other parts of the 
world demonstrate without any doubt that long-term peaceful 
coexistence and mutual cooperation is not possible unless the 
principles of tolerance, democracy, and respect for human rights 
are applied and are preserved throughout the world. The 
architecture of Europe will necessarily change to an ever 
greater extent as we are advancing toward a greater integration, 
a greater political union, and a more comprising enlargement. 
However, in spite of these changes, these fundamental 
principles and our commitments must remain firm. The future of 
Europe will ultimately depend on the success of our strivings. 
I am confident that Romania shares this commitment. I am sure 
too, that there is a political will in your country to make the 
necessary steps and to ensure that the future of Romania and of 
its people will be one of peace, democracy, and prosperity in 
the heart of an integrated Europe. You may rest assured that 
the European Parliament supports you and encourages you in 
achieving this goal. I can tell you, Europe needs Romania but 
certainly Romania also needs Europe. Thank you for your 
attention. [applause]

  [Text] Romanian President Ion Iliescu received European 
Parliament President Egon Klepsch at Cotroceni Palace this 
afternoon. During the meeting President Ion Iliescu briefed the 
guest on the current stage and future prospects of the reform 
process and on the efforts to implement the reform program. At 
the same time, the sides exchanged views on the prospects for 
settling the conflict in former Yugoslavia and consolidating 
security in the Balkans. In his turn, the guest positively 
assessed the progress made of late by Romania and emphasized the 
efforts of all forces toward integration in the European 
structures. 
  Klepsch also had a meeting at Victoria Palace this afternoon 
with Mircea Cosea, minister of state and chairman of the Council 
for Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform. The Romanian 
minister briefed the guest on the progress of reform and the 
economic and financial measures which have enabled Romania to 
fulfill the conditions stipulated in the stand-by agreement with 
the IMF. 
  I answered the invitation to come to Romania to prove that 
we, the European Community, are very interested in relations 
with your country, Klepsch said at the opening of a news 
conference organized at the Senate headquarters this afternoon. 
He said that our country has a particular importance as far as 
ensuring regional stability is concerned. The president of the 
European Parliament appreciated the fact that the political 
structures in Romania have stabilized and that, after the 
signing of the treaty on our country's association with the 
European Community, relations between the European Parliament 
and the Romanian Parliament can further develop. 
  Klepsch positively assessed the quality of the talks he 
conducted during his two-day visit to Romania and focused his 
attention on his meetings with the leaders of political parties 
and with various parliamentarians. There is a particular 
consensus on your country's European integration, Klepsch said. 
Regarding the problem of minorities, he appreciated the valid 
legal provisions extant in our country and emphasized that all 
that is left to be done is to implement them. 
  Answering a question, the president of the European 
Parliament said that it is very difficult to make a precise 
forecast about the date of Romania's admission to the European 
Union. Everything is up to Romania, he said, according to our 
reporter Victor Spirache.

<F P=106> ["Petan"-signed interview with Gabor Kuncze, prime </F>
ministerial candidate for the Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ; 
place and date not given: "Privatization Cannot Be Stopped -- 
The SZDSZ Faces a Crossroads -- Interview With Gabor Kuncze"] 
  [Text] We are continuing our series that was started 
before the first round of the elections. This time we interview 
Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of the Alliance of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. As is known, the Free Democrats 
received 19.74 percent of the votes in the 8 May elections and 
remain in contention in second place. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Preparing for the second round of the 
elections, you keep emphasizing that you do not wish to change 
the tone of your campaign. However, you would like to throw 
light on the differences between the programs of the Socialists 
and the Free Democrats. In your view, what are the main 
differences? 
  [Kuncze] We primarily start from the premise that only a 
liberal economic policy can find a way out of the current state 
of the country's economy. This means a strict budget austerity 
policy on one side and tax reductions and tax allowances to 
stimulate investment on the other. Conditions for growth have 
to be established, and when Hungary has economic growth then 
this will lay the foundations for increased living standards. 
It does not work the other way round. We are aware of how 
various people live in this country and, with this in mind, I 
say that it is impossible for some sharing to be launched 
because this would result in upsetting the balance or in having 
to levy extra taxes. This can be an important difference 
because, although the economic program of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] prepared by Laszlo Bekesi contains 
similar elements, it is a big question whether the party's core 
will stand by it and the trade unions led by Sandor Nagy will 
support this or something else. The citizens' attention has to 
be directed to the fact that the SZDSZ is only able to implement 
its ideas if it gets adequate authority to do this. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Does this mean that there is a negotiating 
basis as far as economic programs are concerned? 
  [Kuncze] This is possible, meaning the program of Bekesi. 
To what extent it is possible to agree on the principles 
represented by the SZDSZ on this issue is a always a big 
question. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Do you agree with the left-wing intention 
that the preferential share purchase program [KRP] and 
privatization should be stopped? 
  [Kuncze] Applying the KRP in too broad a circle means 
considerable costs to the country. Therefore, this cannot be 
further extended. We agree with ensuring an adequate range of 
assets in exchange for compensation notes. As a matter of fact, 
the KRP does not mean additional resources for the enterprises 
and it does not even mean real owners, and this is why we do not 
wish to continue it. As for privatization, our view is that 
stopping it is out of the question. It has to be carried out 
with more determination and faster then now to hand over the 
assets to private ownership as soon as possible. It is 
necessary to change the institutional system, to apply more 
privatization techniques, and to ensure social control. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] What role do you intend for the State 
Property Management Corporation [AVRT] and the State Property 
Agency [AVU]? 
  [Kuncze] We did not agree with establishing the AVRT and we 
would also have placed the AVU under parliamentary control. We 
still have the same intentions. We believe that the two 
institutions should be amalgamated. It will also have to be 
considered whether we need such a large amount of state assets 
as at the moment is prescribed by law. Almost all aspects of 
the privatization laws will have to be amended. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Is there a contradiction here? Would 
parliamentary control slow down the processes? 
  [Kuncze] We are always questioned about this because people 
interpret this as meaning that parliament would make the 
privatization decisions. This is not so. One level of 
parliamentary control is that parliament will appoint the 
participants of privatization, the assets that are to remain in 
state ownership, and the general asset policy guidelines. The 
second level is that a deputy from each of the parliamentary 
parties should be delegated into the supervisory committee of 
the asset management organization that is to be set up. We are 
not saying that parliament will constantly be examining every 
single case. As all parties will participate in the 
supervision, social control will be ensured because the 
parliamentary parties as a whole represent a significant part of 
society. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] In your view, is the country's economic 
situation indeed more tragic than four years ago? 
  [Kuncze] Successes and failures have both characterized the 
past four years. I do not think it is correct to say that the 
country only had successes but I also consider it unacceptable 
that only failures existed. Accordingly, the country's economic 
situation is diverse. Some positive and very many negative 
phenomena exist. I see the breakdown of the internal and 
external balance and future dangers from this as most 
problematic. The government that came to power four years ago 
had countless opportunities to act -- compared with this, the 
room for maneuver is significantly smaller now. This is why the 
next government will be in an incomparably more difficult 
situation. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] As for the first round of the elections, 
there did not seem to be too much cheering by the SZDSZ. 
Nevertheless, you are still in contention, in second place.... 
  [Kuncze] The Free Democrats have had a successful result. 
More people voted for us on the lists than four years ago, and 
our candidates are still in contention in 162 places. The 
reason we were not cheering in our headquarters in Merleg Street 
is that we had more or less expected these results, and, at the 
same time, we know that the second round can considerably 
influence the final results. In my view, the MSZP received too 
much support from the voters, and I would not find it fortunate 
if the Socialists acquired too much power. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Under what conditions and with what 
proportions can a possible MSZP-SZDSZ coalition become a 
realistic idea? 
  [Kuncze] The ability to coordinate programs is the most 
important point of view. If the MSZP acquires an absolute 
majority on its own, this will mean that the SZDSZ does not have 
the necessary weight and, in this case, it would be rather 
difficult for us to enter into a coalition. In this case, I 
would not even support doing so. If the Socialists do not have 
the majority, then the Free Democrats will be under certain 
constraints because, if we did not enter the coalition, new 
elections would have to be called. As for issues of personnel, I 
regard these as of secondary importance. I do not want to talk 
about myself. However, it is a fact that [MSZP Chairman] Gyula 
Horn is unacceptable to the SZDSZ as prime minister. As for 
proportions, getting 25 percent of the parliamentary seats would 
already mean a serious influence for the Free Democrats.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F>
Democrats, and Laszlo Bekesi, economic expert of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party, by Ivan Gador; place and date not given: 
"Robinson Crusoe and Man Friday in Politics? -- Laszlo Bekesi 
and Ivan Peto Talk About the Coalition Possibilities"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Not yet knowing the election 
results, political scientist Attila Agh said that the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] are like Robinson Crusoe and Man Friday to each other. 
They might not really want each other but they cannot live 
without each other. Can you accept this view? 
  [Peto] [passage omitted] The MSZP has a chance to get an 
absolute majority. Therefore, technically, the Socialists do 
not need us. However, politically they do. A coalition 
government is more useful for the country in all respects than a 
one-party government. However, it is no use denying that a good 
number of MSZP members treat the dilemma of a coalition or a 
one-party arrangement as a simple technical matter and tend, for 
this reason, toward the former. [passage omitted] 
  [Gador] In recent days, many guesses have surfaced about the 
MSZP's actual direction. Whether it will support the 
Bekesi-type social-liberal line -- this is actually the party's 
accepted program -- or follow a separate road in the hope of a 
large-scale victory. 
  [Bekesi] Certain subjective intentions and ideas -- 
especially in the current situation -- obviously do emerge. 
However, what Attila Agh said is an objective necessity, 
however we look at it. To use the slogan of a well-known film: 
"You cannot do it on your own...." Especially because -- this 
might sound like a commonplace -- the country is in a difficult 
situation. This situation can be described in terms of three 
typical attributes: The economic crisis has become deeper, the 
etatist governing of the past four years has created nausea and 
much damage, and, according to 2.8 million voters -- the two 
parties together received this number of votes -- the way out of 
this can only be found by implementing a modernization program. 
A social-liberal economic policy is clearly required to 
restrain the economic crisis and establish the conditions for 
growth. This can only be implemented by a coalition government 
of this structure. In other words, it cannot indeed be done 
alone. The progressive political forces have to work together, 
otherwise the trust will be lost. A close cooperation is 
primarily in the interest of the party that receives the most 
votes. I do not think this need be further explained. In 
addition to this, we need not make very great efforts for our 
parties to cooperate. As Peto also mentioned, the major 
features of our programs can be harmonized even if experts have 
disagreements on minor issues. However, these can be bridged. 
We have complete agreement on the essential issues, for example 
that etatism has to be eliminated: The "withdrawal of the 
state," or deregulation is one of the most important tasks. 
  [Gador] In other words, among other things, you agree that 
the citizens should be left in peace and they need not be told 
every day what to do. 
  [Bekesi] Certainly. The state must not oppress people, 
their lives, or the economy. It might be naivete on my part but 
I believe that since 53 percent of the electors have voted for 
this program then they have only authorized us to implement this 
program. The electors believe that this program can 
successfully be implemented together. Therefore, their 
confidence does not only apply separately but it also obliges us 
to cooperate. If this is so, then it is our duty to overcome 
the mistrust that undoubtedly exists between our parties. This 
is in the interest of both parties. 
<H5>  Bekesi: Realistically, Logically </H5>
  [Gador] However, the MSZP received almost twice as many 
votes as the SZDSZ. I very well remember that, from the first 
moment to the last, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] alluded 
to the fact that the majority of Hungarian society had voted for 
them: These votes meant that they were right. Are you sure 
that this false euphoria will not capture the MSZP? 
  [Bekesi] If we are realistic and logical, we do not think in 
terms of parliamentary arithmetic and the party will not be 
overcome by the arrogance of power just because it got more 
votes than its partner. Overvaluing the numerical success of 
the elections can also be a very visible lesson for my party. I 
know that 1.8 million people voted for us in the first round, 
but even if I had never learned mathematics, I would know how 
little this is compared with the 10.5 million Hungarian 
citizens. We also have to recognize that, even together with 
the SZDSZ's 1 million votes, the two parties only have less than 
28 percent of society's and 33 percent of the electors' 
confidence; therefore, we have no right to any kind of 
authoritarian behavior. We must cooperate with society and, to 
be able to do this, mainly with each other. 
  [Gador] This recognition is respectable. However, does this 
mean that you will not use any "power" superiority when the 
probable coalition talks are started after the second round and 
the offices and ministerial positions are allocated? 
  [Bekesi] Let me recall the agreement between Helmut Schmidt 
and Hans-Dietrich Genscher when the Social Democrats ended up 
with more than 40 percent at the elections while the Free 
Democrats did not get more than 7 or 8 percent. The allocation 
of ministerial positions was decided by sober consideration 
rather than by the proportion of the parliamentary 
representation. They governed successfully at the time. This 
is what is before our eyes! [passage omitted] 
  [Gador] Politicians of two parties, who have very 
different backgrounds, are sitting here and are agreeing on all 
the important issues, and they might at most be politely and 
quietly debating each other's arguments and conclusions. I do 
not wish to be cynical: Hungarians have been dreaming about 
this. However, is this not only a case of what the conservative 
politicians and journalists accuse you of, namely that you want 
to achieve a two- third majority in parliament, and can then 
even legally rewrite the Constitution. Many people believe -- 
and the predecessors of the Socialists are an example of this -- 
that uncontrolled and uncontrollable power is bound to become 
distorted. 
  [Peto] Every kind of power can be abused at any time; 
however, it might not be worth it. This kind of policy does not 
work in the long run, and not even in the short term nowadays.... 
  [Bekesi] And we do not wish to fail. 
  [Peto] A possible two-thirds majority can be used, rather 
than abused, because, for example, the parliamentary order of 
procedure can be changed in such a way that parliament will 
indeed be able to function. In the meantime, the rules that we 
are planning would significantly expand the rights of the 
opposition. This is what we have been saying for years, 
actually.... 
  [Bekesi] A new law on local authorities and the media should 
be made.... 
  [Peto] If I wanted to speak with pathos, I would say that 
the SZDSZ has not been fighting for basic democratic rights for 
years so as to become anti-democratic now that it may come to 
power. [passage omitted] 
  [Bekesi] Uncontrolled and uncontrollable power is indeed 
frightening. It must not exist. The MSZP, just like any other 
party, only has a chance for successful governing in a 
coalition, otherwise it will fail. This will not change whether 
we get 48 or 52 percent after the second round. I repeat: The 
dominance and the ministerial seats have to be decided on the 
basis of rational consideration rather than in accordance with 
the parliamentary power relations after 29 May. The country -- 
and among others, to maintain its prestige, the MSZP -- needs a 
rational government that is able to operate and which is 
professionally impeccable. [passage omitted]

  [Text] If they come to power, the Socialists and the Free 
Democrats will conduct a foreign policy which gives equal 
priority to relations with the East and the West and with 
Hungarians living beyond the country's borders. Laszlo Kovacs 
and Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, foreign policy experts for the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ], respectively, have announced that Hungarian 
foreign policy will change substantially both in its style and 
methods. 
  The SZDSZ politician also said that with respect to 
neighboring countries, they will present a pragmatic policy 
which is adjusted to Hungary's dimensions and true significance.

<F P=106> [Interview with Albanian President Sali Berisha by Branimir </F>
Baron Brljevic; place and date not given: "`The Insane Serbian 
Generals Have Been Staging a Conflict Between the U.S. and 
Russian Armies in the Balkans!'"] 
  [Text] Albanian President Dr. Sali Berisha is an integral 
figure in the democratic changes in the most backward European 
country, in whose towns the water and electricity supplies last 
only a few hours a day, but where there are almost no large 
buildings on which there are not at least several satellite 
antennas. The man who woke this sleeping beauty and led it, at 
a hardly bearable speed, away from its Middle Ages is an 
internationally renowned cardiologist who was for many years the 
personal physician to the ill-reputed dictator Enver Hoxha. 
  I found him angry with the latest announcement of the Greek 
Government, which stated that Albania had not declared the 
Orthodox Easter a national religious holiday. President Berisha 
explained that it was with the intention of dispelling any 
doubts about a religion being discriminated against that he 
personally attended the central Easter celebrations, along with 
the patriarch of the autocephalous Albanian Orthodox Church, 
Anastos Janullatos, who is of Greek nationality. I let him talk 
about the incomprehensible behavior of the once friendly 
southern Greek neighbor, about the recent murder of two Albanian 
border patrolmen, and about hundreds of thousands of Albanian 
workers being expelled from Greece because of the alleged denial 
of minority rights to the Greeks in Albania. He gave me only a 
short smile after I told him that all his country needed after 
the programmed destruction of public institutions, factories, 
and schools that was conducted by the old regime just before the 
first free elections, were neighbors competing at being hostile. 
President Berisha is impressively modest: He is still living 
in a two-room apartment with his wife and two children. 
<H5>  Chief Support -- the West </H5>
  [Brljevic] You recently received General Robert Oaks, the 
U.S. Air Force commander. What did you discuss? 
  [Berisha] We discussed the preparations and military 
cooperation in case the war in the Balkans escalates soon and 
spreads toward the south. Mr. Oaks said he that agreed the 
spreading of the conflict to Kosovo was possible and probable. 
  [Brljevic] Albania used to rely on the West. Are you not 
afraid it will betray you again? 
  [Berisha] We have received firm guarantees that this will 
not happen. We have had enough time to prepare the defense of 
the country. It was obvious that if no one was decisive enough 
to stop Milosevic, who now needs the war in order to survive, 
then there would be a great war on the entire Balkans. I cannot 
tell you state secrets, but you can believe that the West will 
not leave us in the lurch! 
  [Brljevic] Have you not found the fate of the protected 
areas in Bosnia instructive enough? 
  [Berisha] We should wait. The Serbs have been given 
ultimatums in both Sarajevo and in Gorazde. It is very 
important to avoid rash moves that some of the insane 
bloodthirsty Serb generals are counting on to provoke 
confrontation of the U.S. and Russian forces and thus definitely 
make it into the history books. 
  [Brljevic] Was the recent murder of the two Albanian border 
patrolmen programmed in the same context, to make the tense 
situation in this part of the world even worse? 
  [Berisha] After the Serbian aggressor, the one who had 
encouraged it appeared. The whole of Greece is in a nationalist 
fever. The people of the Balkans have always been easy to get 
out in the streets, but the price could be very high this time. 
At a time when it is crucial that passions subside and possible 
conflicts and escalations be prevented, the Greeks are doing 
just the opposite. They have expelled hundreds of thousands of 
our workers. It is true that many of them who are there are not 
registered, and we are grateful that they are helping us 
overcome our difficulties that way too, but it is completely 
unacceptable to use that fact as a factor of political pressure 
on our country. I want us to improve our relations, to solve 
the issue of refugees, economic emigrants, and members of the 
Greek minority in a humane way. I particularly want their human 
and ethnic rights to be protected, but it is all in vain, 
because the Greek authorities manipulate their minority and at 
one moment they will accept our workers, while at the next they 
expel them in a very uncivilized way. The latest incident has 
forced us to put the responsibility on the Greek Government 
because the commandos arrived from their territory and returned 
there. We have demanded that they be identified. 
<H5>  Chauvinists in Athens </H5>
  [Brljevic] How did they reply? 
  [Berisha] That it was a contradiction. Allegedly we, at the 
same time, accused them of a crime, and asked them to identify 
terrorists. For heaven's sake, each government is responsible 
for the crime that the terrorists who arrive from its territory 
and return to it commit. We did not say they committed it; we 
are only asking them to identify the perpetrators. Although 
they have denied it, we cannot rule out the possibility that 
they organized it. The Greek Government did not condescend to 
show signs of regret or express condolences even several days 
after the crime. If it had not been for the international 
public, they would not have even issued the announcement on the 
contradiction. We are aware that there are many people in 
Greece who would like relations to be strained, but we do not 
wish to contribute to that. 
  [Brljevic] Is that possible? One can see from the example 
of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] that it will be difficult. 
  [Berisha] Greek politics seems to be one big outrage. The 
first such outrage was the underhand alliance with Serbia. 
Moreover, a very hostile policy is being conducted toward the 
European Union, of which Greece is a member and which it will 
continue to preside over for a while. Regardless of that, they 
keep saying that Europe is against Greece, although Greece is 
the nursery of civilization. At the same time, Greece is 
probably the only country in the world in which the church has 
not been separated from the state. 
  [Brljevic] How autocephalous is the Albanian Orthodox 
church, considering the fact that one fourth of the Albanians 
are Orthodox? 
  [Berisha] We insist that the Albanian Orthodox be 
autocephalous. We did not oppose the Patriarchate of 
Constantinople appointing Janullatos, a Greek, as patriarch, 
because we do not want to meddle in the affairs of any religion. 
The Greek authorities have recently demanded that I appoint 
Greek ministers in the southern Albanian provinces, but I 
answered that I had no intention of doing so. Namely, the 
church has a hierarchy that has to be respected. I told them I 
was very surprised by this demand of a government that is 
supposed to be a democratic one. 
  [Brljevic] Did you communicate with the Greek authorities 
directly? 
  [Berisha] During our first meeting, I asked them openly 
about the so-called chauvinist circles. They said that they 
could not do anything about it, that each country has its own 
chauvinist circles. I told them that it was not right that 
everyone should think the same and that I should see them all in 
the same chauvinist circle. 
  [Brljevic] Do you think that this nationalism is 
uncontrolled or that it is a product of a clever manipulation of 
national feelings, an exponent of foreign, Serb, interests, and, 
through them, Russian ones? 
  [Berisha] Greece is sailing, and constantly swaying, between 
the East and the West, between these two tendencies. They are 
dreaming about a Great Hellas with the Aegean capital at 
Constantinople. They have got into the same nationalist fever 
as the Serbs. I thought that both have paid a high enough price 
for their blind nationalisms once in this century, but I was 
wrong. Just look at the present-day Greece, talking about itself 
as the nursery of civilization. It is to a much greater extent 
Byzantine than it complies with the principles of modern 
civilization. They, like their Orthodox brothers Serbs, are 
much better at practicing Byzantine deviousness. 
<H5>  The Fear and Lies of the East </H5>
  [Brljevic] The Koran has been printed in Egypt in the 
Albanian language. The introduction says that after the fall of 
Communism a new plague, Christianity, hangs over Albania. Do 
you not have the impression that nobody will leave you alone? 
  [Berisha] I agree with you. We are trying to act in 
accordance with the principles of tolerance among the members of 
all the three religions that have always been strong on the 
Albanian territories. This is the reason this Koran, printed in 
Egypt, has been the only book to be banned since I became 
president. Perhaps it would be better to tear out the page, but 
we decided to ban it by way of warning all those who could 
attempt to do something similar. At any rate, the 
above-mentioned sentence printed in the Koran opposes its 
teaching, which does not allow favoring any religion. 
  [Brljevic] Is the impression that, despite your pro-Western 
orientation, the Islamic countries have been investing more in 
Albania, wrong? 
  [Berisha] Only partly. Europe is post-communist. After the 
Iron Curtain came down, the duality on the continent was 
revealed. The closeness of the Yugoslav conflict has also been 
harmful to our economic development. Many Westerners have 
promised to invest their capital once the war is over, and as 
long as it seems that a great war is looming over the Balkans, 
there is no chance of a stronger breakthrough of foreign 
capital. Although we have opened our foreign policies toward 
the world completely, they are still reserved about us because 
we used to be so isolated. The greatest progress we have 
achieved is with Italy, and we expect significant U.S. aid and 
the aid of other, not only military, but also economic 
superpowers. Croatia is surely one of our desired partners. 
The neighboring Macedonia could also find a solution for the 
relations with the Albanian ethnic community and become an even 
more important economic partner for us. 
  [Brljevic] The people in all the post-communist countries 
trust the United States more than Europe. Since this is also 
the case with your country, how do you explain it? 
  [Berisha] All the newly-founded countries consider the 
United States to be the main pillar of Western civilization. 
The pro-U.S. atmosphere in Albania, including my own 
disposition, does not in any way collide with the pro-European 
orientation. In recent history, Europe would get involved in 
wars as soon as the United States would take a distance, as soon 
as it would stop functioning as the pillar of Western 
civilization. The Westerners and Easterners have different 
fates, different souls. One should always bear in mind that the 
Easterners lived under dictatorships, which, together, made up 
an empire founded on fear and lies. The people in this empire 
aspired toward truth, the only light in their darkness. That is 
why truth is their weak spot. Europe faced the fall of the Iron 
Curtain unprepared. The entire West is now faced with the 
crisis of civilization, the main expression of which is the war 
in Bosnia. It clearly shows that the entire civilization, the 
modern world, suffers from collective amnesia. Double standards 
are used everywhere. We are all responsible for the evil that 
is happening before our eyes, primarily Europe, in which the 
public opinion has never been more tolerant of the horrors that 
are happening in it, as they are now tolerant of the Bosnian 
horrors. 
  No one can deny us the right to self-defense, as has been 
done with the Muslims in Bosnia after the entire world had found 
itself surprised with the Serb aggression. If the democratic 
world order does not wake up in Bosnia, it could easily be 
murdered in its selfish sleep. I have said this to every 
Western politician I have had the chance to talk to. 
  [Brljevic] The West is still trying to make the Serbs come 
to their senses through negotiations. In your opinion, how long 
can this "Brusseling" and "Genevesing" last? 
  [Berisha] The international community must eventually take 
specific measures, as sanctions, threats, and ultimatums are not 
enough. Serbia, encouraged by the world's reluctance, can now 
only understand the language of force, the speech of weapons. 
It is still not too late for a military intervention. The 
Serbs must pay for what they have done, they must bear the 
consequences. 
  [Brljevic] Mr. Berisha, does the fact that they have only 
been rewarded by the international community, which has agreed 
to all the new conquests, not discourage you? 
  [Berisha] Double standards can be applied to almost 
everything in this war. Plans, peace negotiations, and Security 
Council resolutions are hardly more than alibis for passivity. 
However, it is high time the world realized that any further 
hesitation will lead to a great war on the Balkans. It is not 
difficult to foresee what can follow. 
  [Brljevic] The Serbian repression in Kosovo is becoming more 
intense by the day. Is that not a case of "ethnic cleansing" 
without war? 
  [Berisha] Ethnic cleansing has been present in Kosovo for a 
long time. The Serbian president has been trying to provoke a 
war against the unarmed people in every possible way. Perhaps 
the Greeks are provoking us with the same motives. 
<H5>  Dialogue With Skopje </H5>
  [Brljevic] What will you do if war breaks out in Kosovo? 
  [Berisha] We will not hesitate to help our brothers, you can 
rely on that. 
  [Brljevic] Will Albania in that case declare war on Serbia 
alone? 
  [Berisha] If there is a massacre in Kosovo, I am sure that a 
NATO military intervention will be inevitable. The picture of 
hundreds of thousands of people of Kosovo, our brothers, fleeing 
to Macedonia before a massacre, means the explosion of 
Macedonia. The next picture is giving a hand to the Albanian 
brothers by Albania and Macedonia -- a new Balkan war. 
  [Brljevic] How have your relations with Macedonian president 
Gligorov been since the Albanian minority was accused of 
conspiracy and an attempt at creating Illyria? 
  [Berisha] Our overall relations are good, and we are 
interested in the stability of Macedonia. There have been some 
Byzantine tricks; the ones we remember especially well are the 
ones organized three years ago. 
  [Brljevic] Albania has offered Macedonia access to the sea, 
is that right? 
  [Berisha] We are glad we can help them. President Gligorov 
has been trying to solve the difficulties in his country, torn 
between Serbia and Greece, and sometimes he is suprisingly good 
at it. Our joint interest is to create the atmosphere of 
integration in the entire region, which has been falling apart 
at the seams. The greatest enemy of the Balkans is after all its 
allegedly greatest stability factor, the so-called Yugoslav 
National Army. Its monstrous potential must be destroyed. The 
United States has drawn the red line at Kosovo. President Bush 
did it first, and President Clinton underlined it. Milosevic's 
Serbia would be a factor of permanent instability on the 
Balkans, a fact which has been taken very seriously in the 
United States. Ten percent of the territory cannot dominate the 
entire region. 
  [Brljevic] What are the indications of Milosevic's alleged 
intention to spread the war on Kosovo? 
  [Berisha] Although he is pretending he would like peace, 
Milosevic needs the war to stay in power. He has been promising 
the Serbs peace for a long time, but the war is going on, and it 
has become a way of life, a hypostatized Serb mentality. When 
the Bosnian Serbs achieve their aims, which is evidently only a 
question of time, Milosevic will need another conflict. While 
the United Nations is protecting the occupied parts of Croatia, 
they are cementing what has been conquered, and the danger of 
the war spreading to the south after all is therefore much 
greater. 
  [Brljevic] Meanwhile, Albania and Macedonia are competing 
to acquire prophylaxis against Serb fascism, buying peace from 
Serbia with oil? 
  [Berisha] These are only rumors. We are abiding strictly by 
the embargo, since to support Serbia in its sick intentions in 
this dirty war would be very stupid, dishonorable, and dangerous. 
<H5>  The Recognized Borders </H5>
  [Brljevic] Is the number of Albanian soldiers a secret? 
What weapons do you have? 
  [Berisha] We have 35,000 soldiers. The outmoded Russian and 
Chinese weapons have been preserved well; many Western experts 
were surprised by how well preserved they are. Naturally, we 
need new military technology, especially modern anti-aircraft 
defense. We have warships, air forces, and heavy weapons. The 
air forces are outmoded, but there is quite a lot of equipment. 
We would like to reach European military standards. We have 
reduced the term of compulsory military service. In agreement 
with NATO we have carried out reforms in the army, which their 
experts say are the most radical of all the reforms in the 
former Communist countries. We have conducted an integral 
reconstruction of our command staff in all the army corps. We 
have democratized all the structures, which has significantly 
changed the mentality of our officers. We have sent all those 
above 48 years of age into retirement. However, it is not a 
secret that in case there is a war we will be counting on NATO 
and the United States. Albania has already joined the 
preparations for the event a military intervention takes place 
earlier. 
  [Brljevic] Could a possible intervention against Serbia 
solve the problem of Kosovo? 
  [Berisha] No one can deny the Albanians of Kosovo the right 
to self-determination. Serbia has violated the Yugoslav 
constitution by denying Kosovo its autonomy, which is where 
everything started. Up until then Kosovo was a constituent 
element of the federation, two presidents of which were from 
Kosovo. A military intervention would not solve the entire 
problem, but it would certainly start the process of seeking a 
democratic solution. 
  [Brljevic] Does that imply a Greater Albania? 
  [Berisha] There will be no changing of borders by force! We 
have recognized the borders of the former Yugoslav republics, 
and all we are asking is some democratic space for the members 
of our nation, wherever they may be. We insist on the right of 
a nation to make its own decisions about its future. In a 
democratic atmosphere there is no need to "raise" borders.

<F P=106> [Article by Alban Bala: "When Will They Be Giving Out </F>
Identification Cards?"] 
  [Text] Currently three-quarters of the people in Albania do 
not have any personal identification cards. Letters of 
certification have been distributed, but is this sufficient? 
  Since 1981 no identification cards have been prepared by the 
Albanian Government, which, prior to 1990, had used the funds 
set up for this purpose in the Ministry of Public Order. For 
almost four years citizens have had only letters of 
certification of their citizenship because there has been no 
government decision or, more importantly, there have been no 
funds. This has created anomalies and possibilities for abuse 
and falsifications, presenting no small danger for the country. 
It is said that falsified letters of certification are being 
sold in Greece, thereby making it possible for Albanians to 
change their names. In addition to international passports, a 
number of foreign countries also require ordinary identification 
cards, a requirement which -- since it is transformed into a 
"necessity" -- becomes a source of illegal business and profit 
in the respective areas. 
  "We have made several appeals to the government," Abdyl 
Xhaja, director of the Office of Vital Statistics, says, "but it 
is clear that there are no funds." The problem becomes more 
complex when you consider that one-third of Albanians work 
outside the country and that this reform, if it is carried out, 
requires uniformity in development. Another possibility is that 
the government might apply a system like the one in use in many 
European countries -- an ordinary identification card, which is 
also currently in effect in Macedonia. But in Tirana people have 
not been able to get identification cards since June 1990. We 
have to think as soon as possible, not only about recognizing 
the rights of Albanians in this situation but also about 
eliminating opportunities for chauvinistic moves on the human 
level for banal economic reasons.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, May 17 (TANJUG) -- The international 
conference on the former Yugoslavia, set up in London 21 months 
ago, will be extended by another six months. The work on 
restoring peace in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would be resumed in Geneva, despite the fact 
that the conference was sidelined this spring, REUTERS quotes 
diplomatic sources in Geneva as saying. 
  Relevant international bodies have also agreed on allowing a 
budget for the future work of the conference, [words indistinct] 
Russian and especially U.S. initiatives for strengthening the 
Bosnian peace process, have contributed to the sidelining of the 
Geneva conference. 
  The United States, determined to show the Europeans it had 
more efficacious solutions for Bosnia, took over the initiative 
in February. Shortly earlier, in January, the European Union 
(E.U.) plan collapsed because of the U.S.-sponsored Bosnian 
Moslem rejection. Namely, Bosnian Moslem leader Alija 
Izetbegovic took a hostile stand towards the plan, relying on 
undoubted support by the U.S. Administration. The E.U. peace 
plan, the adoption of which was within reach in January, was 
thus completely neglected and international mediators Lord Owen 
and Thorvald Stoltenberg were nearly eliminated from the talks. 
  Despite various efforts made in the meantime -- including 
direct negotiations between Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who have 
signed a federation agreement, and open threats and air strikes 
-- peace in Bosnia was more and more distant. 
  Everything has returned to Geneva where seven ministers of 
the "great troika" (the United States, Russia, the E.U.) on 
Friday reached accord to resume seeking a political solution 
under the E.U. plan, thus taking everything back to where it was 
in January. The latest Geneva initiative, which could also be 
called "a plan of united action," represents a new proposal 
primarily because Washington and Moscow are backing the E.U. 
concept. 
  The latest evidence that everthing is going back to the 
Geneva conference, i.e. the E.U. plan, is seen in the current 
diplomatic mission of Owen and Stoltenberg, who arrived in 
Belgrade on Tuesday to confer with President of the Yugoslav 
Republic of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic. 
  The Yugoslav Government's commission for monitoring the 
international conference on the former Yugoslavia on Tuesday 
requested that the Yugoslav delegation should be treated on an 
equal footing at the conference, especially within the group for 
economic issues and the group for succession, which implies that 
U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) should be 
lifted. 
  The insistence on the lifting of the sanctions is even more 
justified by the fact that Yugoslavia was requested by Geneva to 
submit a report on the application of market economy which is 
hard to realize under the sanctions, the Yugoslav Government's 
commission said at its session.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Assembly member Mehmed Hodzha by </F>
Miroslava Badzheva; place and date not given: "Mehmed Hodzha: 
The Movement for Rights and Freedoms Will Get No More Than 1.5 
Percent in Elections"] 
  [Excerpts] [Badzheva] Mr. Hodzha, now that you have been 
expelled from the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS], will 
you form an alternative to the movement? 
  [Hodzha] We left the DPS parliamentary faction with the 
clear understanding that the DPS cannot survive with this 
leadership. Therefore, we demanded an extraordinary conference. 
Indeed, not only we demanded such a conference, but also the 
representatives of local branches in various regions. However, 
obviously this will not happen. I am convinced that there will 
be no new national conference. This means that we are left with 
the second variant -- to offer our former and potential voters 
something different than the present DPS. Both in the DPS 
parliamentary faction and Central Council there are honest 
people, but this in itself is not enough. An alternative must be 
proposed. I can tell you that this idea exists already several 
months. It has already matured, now we must only put it into 
effect. We will convene a new meeting to which we will 
naturally invite people from all regions in the country who 
adhere to positions similar to ours. We want to attract the 
dissatisfied people who reject the policy of the DPS leadership, 
and most of all, those who are dissatisfied with the cooperation 
with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. All Europe, not only 
Bulgaria, understood that this cooperation is already a fact. 
This leadership is simply genetically committed to cooperating 
with the BSP. The same phenomenon will also exist in the next 
parliament. 
  [Badzheva] What will be your new party's name? 
  [Hodzha] This is not important. The basic principle around 
which we will rally, will be that this is an anticommunist party 
that is not based on an ethnic foundation. Many Bulgarians 
already demonstrate interest in the new party. 
  [Badzheva] Who are the people that will form the core of 
this formation? 
  [Hodzha] I will not divulge any names, everything is still 
within the framework of ideas. Let us wait a bit longer. 
  [Badzheva] When will you announce officially its 
establishment? 
  [Hodzha] In the next few weeks. 
  [Badzheva] When will you hold the planned meeting? 
  [Hodzha] Again, in the next few weeks. 
  [Badzheva] Is the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] helping 
you in forming the "alternative DPS"? 
  [Hodzha] We do not need any helpers. We are sufficiently 
prudent and able people, and can manage alone. 
  [Badzheva] However, nevertheless, you plan to cooperate with 
the SDS? 
  [Hodzha] We would like to work together with the SDS, but 
this is not an unconditional desire. 
  [Badzheva] What conditions will you pose? 
  [Hodzha] The blue [SDS] coalition must share our intentions 
and ideas. We will stress the democratic principles, human 
rights, and resolving social and economic problems -- all this 
that existed at the beginning, when we were together with the 
SDS. 
  [Badzheva] Would you participate in the next elections on 
the same ticket with the SDS? 
  [Hodzha] I cannot answer this question. Let the SDS assess 
whether it needs me or not. [passage omitted] 
  [Badzheva] What do you think, if elections were held now 
what percentage of the vote will the DPS get? 
  [Hodzha] No more than 1.5 percent. I think that this is the 
last participation in the parliamentary elections with this 
leadership. 
  [Badzheva] You claim that the new formation will not be 
based on an ethnic foundation. Will its program contain the 
demand on proclaiming the ethnic Turks in Bulgaria a national 
minority -- a thesis you defended when you were still in the DPS? 
  [Hodzha] Personally, I support collective rights. Now the 
Council of Europe is preparing precisely such a document 
regarding the collective rights of the minorities. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Badzheva] Do you still claim that the higher DPS circles 
are corrupt? 
  [Hodzha] Since I am magnanimous, I will take cigarettes to 
some of the DPS leadership members when they are in prison. 
  [Badzheva] Will you support your claims with documents? 
  [Hodzha] Yes, when the time comes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At about 1300 the Croatian Assembly's House of 
Counties continued its work following three breaks and a meeting 
of the chairmen of the deputies clubs. The deputies are still 
debating the agenda. Throughout the session the Croatian 
Democratic Union [HDZ] club of deputies explicitly demanded that 
all issues on the agenda be dropped except for the one relating 
to a proposal to recall House of Counties Speaker Josip Manolic. 
  The opposition representatives held a different view. They 
insisted on the original agenda, including the current affairs 
hour during which government representatives were to answer 
questions raised by deputies. The vice president confirmed that 
the government was in agreement with the demand of the HDZ club 
of deputies and that it had withdrawn all parts of the draft 
legislation included in the agenda. 
  During the debate the president of the House of Counties 
called on Vice President Damir Zoric to preside over the rest of 
the session. In conclusion, 12 assembly committees are 
preparing tomorrow's session of the Croatian Assembly Chamber of 
Representatives.
