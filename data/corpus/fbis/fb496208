    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 20 May within its 
regular 16-minute newscast carries several reports on the 
situation in the republic. 
  Kemal Halilhodzic reports that "the past 24 hours have been 
extremely difficult for Bugojno and parts of the free Donji 
Vakuf territory. The approximately 60 destructive long-range 
shells that the chetniks launched from the surrounding hills on 
the populated regions from the direction of Kupres and Donji 
Vakuf killed four people and seriously or lightly wounded 10, 
including four children. 
  Smail Terzic reports that "in the region covered by the 7th 
South Operations Group, the village of Sije has been exposed to 
the fiercest attacks. During almost all of last night, the 
aggressor shelled this village and the defense lines with mortar 
bombs. The material damage is huge." Further on in the report, 
Terzic says that "the enemy is attacking these free territories 
with all available weapons and artillery pieces in order to 
reach the Doboj-Teslic road. However, the defense lines are 
increasingly firmer and more stable by the day" 
  A report by the 4th Corps Information Service says that 
"last 
night and the early morning hours in the zone covered by the 4th 
Corps were somewhat calmer than during the previous day, 
although on several occasions, the chetniks fired all kinds of 
artillery pieces, with the barrels directed at [names 
indistinct]. Some provocative activity has been registered on 
the Mostar battlefield as well. A calmer start to the day, with 
only occasional aggressor's fire from antiaircraft weapons on 
the Konjic battlefield in the region of (Djelomici) and 
(Glasicevo), does not mean that the chetniks have given up the 
shelling of residential districts in the zone covered by the 4th 
Corps. These areas have been shelled almost incessantly lately; 
artillery assaults are being launched suddenly, therefore the 
general danger alarm is still in force in Konjic. 
  "Along the lines of separation between the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], there 
have been no incidents during last night and this morning, 
unlike the previous day when, on several occasions, HVO 
extremist snipers fired on our fighters' lines on the Mostar 
battlefield. Frequent explosions coming from the Dubravska 
Plateau have also been registered and it seems that HVO 
extremists have been blowing up the remaining Bosniak houses, 
which means that there are still some hotheads in the HVO ranks 
who oppose the signed agreements." 
  Studio Announcer Aleksandra Hafeti reads report of the 
Gorazde Press Center that "the protected zone of Gorazde has 
still been exposed to aggressor's attacks with shells and 
anti-aircraft weapons."

  [Text] Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik discussed at a 
news conference held in Bratislava today the results of his 
official visits to France and Slovenia. Regarding the security 
situation in Europe, he stated that refusal to accept the Baltic 
state as members in the Partnership for Peace program will mean 
a violation of the fundamental principle underpinning the 
initiative, which is an individual approach and an equal 
opportunity for all states. According to Jozef Moravcik, the 
granting of special status to Russia will not be favorable for 
the countries of Central Europe, and it will signify to a 
certain extent a return to the idea of the division of the 
sphere of interests between Russia and the countries of the 
European Union or NATO. He added that if Slovakia were to be 
accepted as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance then the 
special status of Russia will not matter to us at all.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by correspondent </F>
Robert Tamchyna in Lany; date not given; from the "Conversations 
at Lany" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Tamchyna] If you will permit, Mr. President, let 
us begin today by casting our minds back to last week when the 
international conference "Europe and Us" was held in Prague. 
When I read excerpts from some of the speeches and 
presentations there were of course some interesting moments and 
even some idealistic notions, but in addition to that a degree 
of uncertainty and apprehension about the question of the future 
of a new, modern Europe and our role within it. 
  [Havel] I did not attend the entire conference, but from 
what 
I heard I get the impression that it was a very interesting and 
important conference. There were some interesting personalities 
here from all over Europe, some of whom I met and spoke to, and 
for me the staging of the conference was a kind of signal to 
consider certain things. 
  For example, I realized, and also said so when I was there 
briefly at the conference, I realized that a temporary, 
transitional phase had ended, not just in our country, but also 
in others that have shaken off communism. We must bear in mind 
the monolithic power that existed here and had at its disposal 
all the instruments of power -- there was no system of political 
plurality. When that power collapsed organizations grew up to 
oppose it and sought a means of organized expression of their 
will. That was the period of the big mass movements, such as 
Solidarity in Poland or Civic Forum in our country, which 
constituted a kind of improvised revolutionary counterbalance to 
the ruling power. It was clear that that was merely a bridging 
period leading to more normal political circumstances in which 
the spectrum of political parties would become defined and in 
which political parties would grow up around various programs. 
  For the first two years we lived through this truly 
transitional phase, full of various anomalies that do not belong 
to normal, stable democratic life, and it was a very important 
period. Nowadays we sometimes have a tendency to make fun of it, 
to turn our noses up at the whole period of revolutionary 
euphoria and the idea of that kind of general understanding, but 
I do not think that that is entirely fair. Let us remember that 
that was the time when all the fundamental changes to the system 
were made. That was the time when the character of our economic 
reforms was agreed upon, when fundamental legislation was 
passed, when the transformation of the entire legal system 
began, and when we established ourselves on the international 
scene as an independent country. But it was a period of 
transition, to which I gave the working label of "post 
communist," by which I wished to express its unusual character. 
  We have had two sets of free elections, we have normal, 
structured political parties which compete for power in those 
elections, and we are genuinely becoming, as far as all the 
external signs of political life are concerned, a normal 
democratic country. I think it is important to realize this, and 
when our politicians are sometimes accused of being arrogant and 
people say that we are always praising ourselves and that we are 
somehow conceited, I think it is possibly a little unjust. We 
are trying to truthfully reflect the situation and to persuade 
others to keep up with the times, so to speak, and to realize 
that we are genuinely further than we were at the beginning of 
1990. 
  The above is not true just of the Czech Republic, which in 
the table of indicators is doing relatively well, but also of 
those neighboring countries where the fact that so-called 
post-communist parties are winning elections is causing a 
certain nervousness. I admit that that does not make me all 
that nervous. I do not see in it any sign of a return to the 
past or anything like that. I would prefer to see it as 
precisely an expression of normality. That is how democracies 
work, sometimes the left wins and sometimes the right, and we 
have to become accustomed to that. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Novi Sad, May 21 (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Milosevic, 
president of the Republic of Serbia, is the most popular 
personality in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.), say 
the results of a poll published here on Saturday. The poll was 
conducted by the `Mark-Plan' marketing centre in 27 
muncipalities throughout the F.R.Y. on the basis of a 
representative sample of 1,045 persons of the different social 
and demographic profile. The questioned were asked to state five 
most popular public figures in the different fields, like 
politics, show business, sports, culture or the like. 
  The largest percentage (16.7 per cent) of the vote went to 
Slobodan Milosevic, followed by National Bank Governor Dragoslav 
Avramovic (7.3 per cent) who eliminated hyperinflation, and two 
folk music singers Dragana Mirkovic (6.9 per cent) and Lepa 
Brena (4.3 per cent). 
  As for other questions, 60 per cent of the answers said they 
would vote again for the political party they voted at last 
December's elections, while 48.6 and 29 per cent respectively 
believed and disbelieved in Dragoslav Avramovic's economic 
recovery program.

  [Excerpts] Tirana--At a news conference in Tirana yesterday 
the leaders of the minority organization "Omonoia" denounced the 
violation of Greek minority rights stemming from the Albanian 
Constitution. 
  They denounced both the ongoing detention of the 
organization's leading members, on which the intervention of 
Albanian President Sali Berisha has been requested, and the ban 
on the functioning of its offices in Gjirokaster as well as 
repeated break-ins at homes by members of the secret police ShIK. 
  Omonoia describes these actions as a violation of human 
rights and points out that they hurt relations between the 
Albanian people and the Greek minority. It recalls that the 
minority was banned from celebrating the 25 March anniversary 
and also leveled serious charges about the operation of minority 
schools. According to these charges, 200 children of the lower 
school grades are prevented from attending classes in Greek. 
  On the organization's claims regarding language, Omonoia 
demands recognition of the right to education, the right to 
perform religious functions, and the broadcasting of radio and 
television programs in Greek, which is used along with Albanian. 
[passage omitted] 
  On political rights, Omonoia demands that the minority 
population get the chance of being hired on every level of 
administration, having their cultural inheritance protected, and 
given freedom to be free to determine their national identity. 
  In its national claims, Omonoia includes recognition of the 
right to establish national parties and the possibility of using 
Greek national symbols along with Albanian national symbols on 
official holidays and anniversaries. 
  Omonoia believes that all its demands are within the limits 
stipulated by the Albanian Constitution and the law "on 
fundamental human rights and freedoms," which has been passed by 
the Albanian Parliament. 
  The organization points out that despite the Albanian 
president's statement, Albania's stance toward the minority has 
not changed and repeated attempts were made to indirectly 
involve the minority in criminal actions at Peshkepi, which, 
together with any use of violence and arbitrariness, is 
denounced by the organization. 
  Omonoia stresses that friendly Albanian-Greek relations are 
essential for peace and stability in the Balkans. [passage

  [Text] [Announcer] Fatos Nano has requested that he be 
released from detention; Robert Gjini and Hasan Hallko have 
asked to be declared innocent; and Sokrat Plaka has not 
presented any request to the Appeals Court. To learn more about 
today's hearing on the appeal of these defendants, let us hear 
the report by our correspondent Armir Shkurti: 
  [Shkurti] The examination of the criminal case of the 
defendants Fatos Nano, Robert Gjini, and Hasan Hallko began in 
the Appeals Court this morning. Following the decision of the 
Tirana Court on 3 April this year, on the basis of the law, 
today the three defendants and their defense counsel presented 
the reasons for their complaints against the verdict of the 
Tirana Court. Fatos Nano and Robert Gjini were present in 
court, while defendant Hasan Hallko was in the hospital with a 
serious case of depression. 
  Perparim Sanxhaku, counsel for defendant Fatos Nano, 
declared 
in front of reporters that he had no complaints against the 
bench of this court, made up of Prele Martini, chairman of the 
Appeals Court, Koco Mano, and Mergim Dragushi. The prosecutor 
is Petrit Duka. Mano read the verdict of the Tirana Court. 
  In a 70-page statement, Counsel Sanxhaku brought forward 
arguments that the verdict of the court of first instance was 
unjust. The defense case appears to be based on reports 
referring to the actions and documentation prepared in Italy. 
According to Sanxhaku, an approximately 500-page report 
contained in the file is in Italian and has not been translated 
in Albanian. Some 200 of the approximately 470 pages of the 
Italian experts' report are missing, the counsel said. Sanxhaku 
insisted that the Italian aid amounted to 20 and not 23 billion 
lira, as stated in the verdict. Sanxhaku asked that the 
indictment be addressed to Pergniola, as he has directly 
profited from the money. 
  The counsel asked the court to rescind the arrest warrant 
against defendant Fatos Nano, include in the file the documents 
that are missing, and translate those that are in Italian. 
Sanxhaku also requested that the case be returned to the Tirana 
Court for completion of the investigation. 
  Defendant Nano began his statement with a political 
discussion in which he called himself a victim of the political 
struggle. He said the trial was a point of reference for 
international states and organizations considering Albania. 
Nano believes that financing from these organizations would 
depend on the position that the judicary maintained toward him. 
  The chairman of the court warned the defendant several times 
that if he continued the political discussion rather than 
present his evidence, his speech would be interrupted. This 
appeared to convince Nano and he continued by defending himself, 
essentially with the same arguments as his counsel, but again 
from the position of a politician. 
  Roland Permeti, counsel for defendant Robert Gjini, used 
almost the same arguments and logic as put forward in the 
defense in the court of first instance. The statement is not a 
document of payment and material responsibility. Albkontrol was 
the one that checked the items and Workshop No. 101/K of the 
State Reserves was directly responsible for receiving the items. 
  Defendant Robert Gjini added few things to the defense of 
his 
counsel. The counsel for defendant Hasan Hallko defended him in 
almost the same way. His client had authorized the counsel to 
speak on his behalf, as he himself was in hospital. Gjini and 
Hallko pleaded innocent. 
  Nano's counsel submitted 10 requests to the court. The court 
turned down the request to requestion 11 witnesses, reexamine 
the experts' report by experts Telegrafi and Shkreli, produce 
the minutes on the interrogation of Fatos Nano at the 
Investigation Office, and produce the price bulletin from the 
Chamber of Commerce in Milan, as well as the request to 
translate 500 pages from Italian and produce the reports of 
petitions, letters, and demands to release Fatos Nano. They 
acceded to the request to produce all the documentation that has 
not been produced so far and investigate all the documentation 
that the counsel thought was not assessed in the trial of first 
instance. 
  Counsel Sanxhaku presented several documents not produced so 
far, which the court will consider. Prosecutor Duka asked for 
time to consider the documents, while the counsels of the 
defendants said they would condition their final statements on 
the prosecutor's statement. The hearing was interrupted and 
will continue at 0900 tomorrow.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Process Generally Orderly, Democratic </H5>
  Reports appearing in the Hungarian media indicate that in 
general the parliamentary election campaign and the first round 
of balloting on 8 May were orderly and democratic, although the 
campaign was marred by some irregularities. Gyula Horn, chairman 
of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) -- which led the field 
in the first round of voting -- declared that on the whole the 
"tone" of the electoral campaign was "acceptable" (MAGYAR 
NEMZET, 6 May), while National Electoral Committee Chairman 
Janos Nemeth said that "the campaign was less rough than 
expected" (NEPSZABADSAG, 9 May). Duncan Schiels, a spokesman for 
the foreign journalists accredited to Budapest, said that the 
campaign was so "calm" that it was "boring" (NEPSZABADSAG, 6 
May), while a delegation of ethnic Hungarians from Romania who 
toured the country to monitor the elections stated that the 
election process was "incredibly civilized" compared to Romanian 
elections (HETI MAGYARORSZAG, 13 May). A "moderate tone" 
characterized the debate of prime ministerial candidates and 
party leaders, according to MAGYAR NEMZET on 6 May, and the 
voting itself was apparently considered fair in most quarters; 
no reports of violations had been observed in the media as of 11 
May. 
<H5>  Biased Television Coverage Alleged </H5>
  Although the election process was deemed satisfactory in 
general, some sources indicated that it was marred by a serious 
flaw -- Hungarian Television's biased coverage, which 
purportedly discriminated against opponents of the main 
government party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF). 
NEPSZABADSAG reported on 4 May that "the majority" of the 
parties were "dissatisfied with the behavior of Hungarian 
Television." According to the paper's 5 May issue, an MSZP 
spokesman declared that his party could show "proof" that the 
state television system was conducting a "negative campaign 
against the Socialists" and was "not neutral in its program 
policies." Similarly, Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate 
of the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), charged that 
although he expected the voting and the counting of ballots to 
be "legal," the lack of fair television campaign coverage 
compromised the election. "The fact that evening after evening 
the television drums the same opinions into the viewer without 
publicizing the other parties' programs is not only unethical, 
but also dangerous," because it prevents voters from making an 
informed choice, Kuncze said (NEPSZABADSAG, 4 May). The 
Independent Smallholders Party also filed a complaint saying 
that the main television news program gave no information about 
the party's program (MAGYAR HIRLAP, 22 April). 
<H5>  Charges Against MDF </H5>
  Hungary's high court ruled invalid the charges that the MDF 
had abused access to government information for campaign 
purposes. After the SZDSZ accused the MDF of using government 
data to identify first-time voters and people who had benefited 
from the government's compensation program to send them campaign 
letters, the National Electoral Committee decided that the MDF 
had acted "against the law," but the decision was struck down by 
the Supreme Court. The Court said that the Electoral Committee 
had "no authority to condemn anyone" and that its accusation was 
also "faulty in its content" because the electoral law gives 
parties access to lists of citizens in specified groups "under 
certain circumstances." Saying that it had been vindicated, the 
MDF charged that the National Electoral Committee had lost its 
neutrality because the representatives of some parties on the 
multiparty committee, "especially the SZDSZ," were using the 
National Electoral Committee meetings to conduct a "political 
campaign" (MAGYAR HIRLAP, 22 April). 
<H5>  Defaced Posters </H5>
  The campaign irregularity reported most frequently by the 
media was the defacement of campaign posters, but reports 
disagreed on the extent of the damage. NEPSZABADSAG on 5 May 
charged that campaign posters "nationwide" were pasted over with 
rival posters and that MSZP, SZDSZ, and Federation of Young 
Democrats (Fidesz) posters were defaced with "slanderous 
slogans," including anti-Semitic graffiti. Other sources 
confirmed that defacement had occurred but suggested that it was 
confined to certain areas. Members of the ethnic Hungarian 
delegation touring Hungary before the election said that the 
posters they saw throughout the country were defaced only "in a 
very few places" (HETI MAGYAR0RSZAG, 13 May), while a "citizens 
network" that monitored the election indicated that anti-Semitic 
slogans and other graffiti were a problem in Budapest, including 
in the capital's 20th District (MAGYAR HIRLAP, 4 May). 
<H5>  Other Alleged Irregularities </H5>
  According to the "citizens network," the defacement of 
posters was just one of "countless refined and crude" attempts 
to "consciously mislead" voters. Some parties and candidates, 
said the group, were guilty of "cheating" in the process of 
gathering nomination slips and of making verbal attacks that 
violated electoral ethics. In some cases, the group alleged, 
nomination slips were stolen from mailboxes and sold "in large 
numbers" for 300 forints, while in the city of Vac, 
representatives of the far right Hungarian Justice and Life 
Party -- which ended up with less than 2 percent of the vote 
nationwide in the first round of balloting -- toured gypsy 
neighborhoods by car and illegally collected "masses of 
nomination slips" for their candidate. In addition, said the 
group, although the election ethical codex stipulated that the 
parties were not allowed to "denigrate" each other, there were 
"plenty of examples" of insulting behavior. One such example, 
the group said, was a campaign letter sent out by the MDF 
candidate in Budapest's third district which charged his MSZP 
opponent with "demagogy," with making "unfounded and 
unfulfillable promises," and with trying to "create false 
nostalgia, which can lead to the strengthening of the left" 
(MAGYAR HIRLAP, 4 May). 
<H5>  Little Violence </H5>
  The media reported few violent incidents during the 
campaign. 
The SZDSZ charged that in the city of Gyongyos on two occasions 
its campaigners were beaten up by members of the MDF's youth 
organization (NEPSZABADSAG, 6 May). In another incident, Fidesz 
activists were attacked by unknown assailants in Budapest, but 
the victims were not certain that the attack was politically 
motivated (BESZELO, 28 April).

<F P=106> [Interview with Domokos Gyorgy Varga, director of the </F>
National Information Office, by H.H.; place and date not given: 
"Polls Apt To Influence Public Opinion"] 
  [Text] The validity of polling data was disputed many times 
by many people who asked whether polls really reflect the will 
of the voters and if so, whether voters who are still undecided 
are influenced by their publication. In connection with this 
matter we visited Domokos Gyorgy Varga, director of the National 
Information Office, who had expressed the opinion earlier that 
various polls are suited to influence public opinion. 
  [H.H.] In one of your earlier articles you expressed the 
opinion that the Szonda Ipsos polling agency was being used not 
only to poll but also to influence public opinion. As a 
response, the firm brought a suit against you. Did your opinion 
change at all now that one or another poll's results are being 
published almost every day in certain nationwide newspapers? 
  [Varga] I consider the present situation unquestionably 
worse. Not only Szonda Ipsos, but other agencies, as well, are 
being used diligently. Through various diversions, by skillfully 
presenting polling data, one of the opposition parties 
represented itself as if the entire country had put its trust in 
it. It would have been possible to protest, because, for 
instance, the polling firm in question protested immediately 
when the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] highlighted and 
interpreted data according to its own taste. 
  [H.H.] Yesterday morning Adam Levendel, director of the 
Szonda Ipsos firm, was a guest on "Chronicle" on Hungarian Radio. 
  [Varga] I had the opportunity to hear it, and to realize 
sadly that the situation in Hungarian public media is beginning 
to seem more and more absurd. Governments in democracies usually 
do not allow the publication of polling data one week before 
elections because the data unequivocally influences public 
opinion. Recently, the BBC even included in its code of ethics 
not to broadcast such data on major news programs even outside 
campaign times. On the other hand, the director of the firm in 
question took the liberty of not only enumerating data, but also 
of picking and choosing data, interpreting it, and even of 
adding his inapplicable comments. It is almost comical that we 
hear about how unreliable the radio is from the programs of the 
radio itself. In the words of the firm's director: From a fool 
according to his folly. 
  But the way he treated the data is also clear propaganda. He 
talked about the advance of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ], and also mentioned the Workers' Party and the Agrarian 
Alliance as having chances of getting in to the parliament. 
Well, the strange thing about this advance is that according to 
details published in the "most popular daily newspaper," among 
voters who are certain to vote and would vote for a certain 
party, the SZDSZ is in the same place today as it was in the 
beginning of March, because in the meantime it had a 3 percent 
setback. However, interestingly enough, the pollsters, and of 
course the press as well, were silent about this setback. I did 
not see huge headlines such as "X Party's Popularity Declining!" 
anywhere. And as far as the Agrarian Alliance is concerned, 
according to the figures it has no more support than the other 
small parties. If that is so, on what scientific grounds was it 
spotlighted? So much for objective information, or rather, for 
manipulation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the National </F>
Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces, by Reni 
Neshkova; place and date not given: "In This Historical Cycle, 
We Lead Hungary by a Head"] 
  [Excerpts] [Neshkova] Mr. Dimitrov, you have always said 
you are a supporter of reasonable compromise in politics. 
Surely the decision of the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] 
Sixth National Conference to exclude the children of active 
fighters against fascism and persons who have applied to join 
the BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party] from holding leading posts 
in the SDS, along with other restrictions, goes beyond the 
bounds of what is reasonable? 
  [Dimitrov] I have been able to state my view on this issue 
on several occasions, and I would like to make this clear. The 
conference was forced to make this decision because of 
circumstances that everyone knows about. In Bulgaria a crazy, 
untrue assertion is spreading and being repeated again and 
again, that half of those responsible for the communist rule are 
in the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], while the other half are 
in the SDS. It is understandable that no political force with 
any self-respect would, except on very rare occasions, place at 
its head, in its most representative organs, people who are wide 
open to attack. They may be the most conscientious people, they 
may be the most competent ones, but if they are open to attack, 
they will put both themselves and the political force in a bad 
position. I assume that this was the motive for the decision -- 
an honorable one, if one supports this thesis. 
  [Neshkova] Nonetheless, surely one of the motives was to 
settle personal accounts within the coalition? 
  [Dimitrov] Personally, I am against exclusive regulations 
and said so at the conference, but the conference was evidently 
inclined to adopt this decision on protective grounds. However, 
I want to make it clear that this decision has not changed 
anything substantial in the SDS. Of course, if the SDS wants to 
win, it will be very difficult for it constantly to have to 
explain why such-and-such or so-and-so is an exception to the 
rule, and so forth. [passage omitted] 
  [Neshkova] You have declared that you oppose any mechanical 
means of evaluating future SDS election candidates and that if 
one of the proposed schemes is applied, Prof. Berov may receive 
a very high classification. 
  [Dimitrov] This is not a completely reliable and sensible 
method of assessing candidates. I believe that some way can be 
found, and we already have enough competent people on whom we 
can rely. At the same time, I believe that it is sensible to 
discuss these candidates to obtain a sufficient guarantee. 
  [Neshkova] What exactly does the decision to boycott 
parliament mean, now that the government is likely to be changed? 
  [Dimitrov] Please allow the political force the right of 
surprise. The conference demonstrated a high degree of unity 
regarding the radical issues concerning the national situation, 
the ways of finding a solution to this situation, and its 
responsibility for finding ways to provoke early elections. 
  [Neshkova] People are saying that the SDS "right wing," with 
which you are identified, won the upper hand. 
  [Dimitrov] Responsibility means knowing what difficulties 
lie ahead and how they can be overcome. This is a very 
difficult position. [passage omitted] 
  [Neshkova] Is it not true that the BSP has been greatly 
encouraged to act more independently, following the victory of 
the former Communists in Hungary, for example? 
  [Dimitrov] I am sure that there are no grounds for this, 
because this is a historical process that at various times 
brought the former Communists to power in the former communist 
states. What is happening now in Hungary happened in Bulgaria 
in 1992, so that we are in front by a head in this historical 
cycle, and I am sure that very soon we will push things in quite 
another direction in Bulgaria.

  [Text] Skopje, 22 May (TANJUG) -- Kiro Gligorov, president 
of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM], and Albanian President Sali Berisha met today at the 
official Albanian residence near the town of Podgradec on Lake 
Ohrid in southern Macedonia and held talks on bilateral 
relations and the current situation in the Balkans. According 
to Macedonian radio, this was an unofficial visit, during which 
President Gligorov accepted an invitation to visit Albania 
officially in the near future. The two presidents held talks in 
private for half an hour and were later joined by their aides. 
  After the talks, Gligorov and Berisha gave statements 
describing the talks as positive, which, though unofficial, 
enabled an exchange of opinions on all questions of interest to 
both states. Both presidents said that a great deal of mutual 
understanding was shown during the talks and that they agreed to 
resume dialogue. 
  According to the Albanian president, they agreed to 
establish 
a Tirana-Skopje air link and gradually to relax the regime of 
visas and passports. Albania expressed readiness to provide 
special facilities for Macedonia to store 1.5 million tonnes of 
fuel and 1 million tonnes of other commodities in Albanian 
ports. Berisha expressed satisfaction over the adoption of the 
Macedonian law on the population census adopted last week and 
praised the government in Skopje for enabling the FLAKA E 
VELEZEREMIT daily to be published in Macedonia in Albanian. He 
also expressed support for the increased television and radio 
broadcasts in Macedonia in the Albanian language and for the 
opening of the teacher-training college in Skopje which uses 
Albanian as one of the official languages. Berisha voiced 
particular satisfaction over the participation of the ethnic 
Albanian party--the Party for Democratic Prosperity--in the 
coalition government. 
  Gligorov stressed the open and friendly atmosphere in 
today's 
talks and said that both sides had an obligation to create 
conditions for ethnic Albanians in Macedonia and ethnic 
Macedonians in Albania to feel at home. The Macedonian 
president particularly stressed the importance of future 
population censuses, which would soon give precise figures on 
the number of Albanians and Macedonians in both countries. 
  After the talks the two presidents and their wives briefly 
visited Ohrid and, according to Macedonian radio, took leave of 
each other with satisfaction.

  [Text] Trstenik, Yugoslavia, May 23 (TANJUG) -- Serbian 
Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic said on Monday that the 
implementation of the Yugoslav programme of monetary 
reconstruction and economic recovery had proved highly 
successful over the past four months. In a meeting with the 
leadership of the Prva Petoljetka holding company in the central 
Serbian town of Trstenik, Marjanovic said that the hard currency 
reserves stood at 336 million dinars (one dinar trades for one 
deutsche mark), that budget deficits were no longer covered by 
primary issue and that economic loans had been substantially 
increased. Speaking about the results of the programme, 
Marjanovic said that from January 24 (when the programme was 
launched) until the first week of May, the prices had been 
completely stabilized and inflation slashed to zero. 
  The prices of industrial products dropped by 14.6 percent 
and 
average salaries increased from 25 dinars in January to 116 
dinars in April, Marjanovic said. Average prices are still 
high, but this is due to inflation before the programme was 
launched, he said and added he hoped that the prices would 
continue to drop, especially as the production was growing. 
  The economic recovery programme was architected by Dragoslav 
Avramovic, a world-renowned economic expert and the current 
governor of the Yugoslav Central Bank.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic by </F>
Dusko Petrovic in Krusevac on 23 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Petrovic] At the end of Prime Minister 
Marjanovic's tour to the (Rasen) region, we asked him for an 
exclusive statement for the "Dnevnik" program of Radio 
Television Serbia. Mr. Prime Minister, it has been exactly four 
months since the program for the economic recovery of the 
country was implemented. What do you think of the results? 
  [Marjanovic] They are impressive. What happened over the 
last four months? The exchange rate of the dinar has been 
maintained and stabilized -- that is, the dinar is stable. 
There is hardly any inflation; it has been reduced to zero. 
Production has increased by almost 14 percent, prices have been 
reduced, and they are now 0.6 lower in comparison with prices 
before the implementation of the program, since January. The 
further upward trend in production has been successful. 
[sentence as heard] Therefore, these are the basic elements 
that speak in favor of the fact that the implementation of the 
program over the first four months has been very successful. 
  The most important thing is how the future implementation of 
the program will proceed in the third and fourth quarters. I am 
an optimist. Considering what I have seen during my visit to 
the Krusevac basin, I am even more of an optimist. 
  [Petrovic] What are you impressions after what you have seen 
and heard from the Krusevac economists? 
  [Marjanovic] The results that have been achieved over the 
first four months of the implementation of this program are such 
that they give us more optimism concerning the future 
realization of this program. Why? First, because production in 
general in the Krusevac region is on the increase. Second, 
because the profit of the companies is also on the rise. 
Salaries are increasing, prices are stable, and there are no 
indications that would suggest that prices could go up. 
  The program that certain companies are applying now is such 
that companies are finding ways of reprogramming their 
production because of the sanctions since not all production 
will work. Products have to have a market, they have to have 
further solutions. [sentence as heard] The solution is not in 
mere production while amassing stocks. Seeing these positive 
tendencies in production in the Krusevac basin, I am really an 
optimist, since the Krusevac basin is one of the most important 
segments in the future development of the Serbian economy.

<F P=106> [Report by N. Vucinic: "Friends Together Again"] </F>
  [Text] The leaders of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] and 
the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] met yesterday in the SRS 
headquarters to discuss, as they said, their next move in 
resisting the repression by the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS]. 
Vojislav Seselj and Vuk Draskovic told reporters that a new 
meeting was called for Monday [23 May] in the SPO headquarters, 
and that it would almost certainly be attended by the leaders of 
the Democratic Party [DS] and the Democratic Party of Serbia 
[DSS], who had been invited too late for yesterday's meeting. 
  Vuk Draskovic, who arrived at the SRS headquarters with 
Milan 
Komnenic, stressed that a purge of the SRS had been under way 
for several months, and that the two of them had come to tell 
the SRS leaders that they could count on the full support of the 
SPO in their defense against the legal and police terror. 
Draskovic stressed that it was not only the SRS that was in 
danger but parliamentarianism, and that the unified attitude of 
the opposition could, as he put it, "discourage the SPS." 
  Seselj said that he was personally very pleased when he 
heard 
about the criminal charges as that showed that the regime was 
nervous. Commenting on the fact that Seselj would answer to the 
same charges he faced last June, Draskovic said that the law put 
the police force on a sacrosanct pedestal, and wondered: What 
is the police doing in the federal assembly? 
  Speaking of earlier differences between the two leaders, 
Draskovic cited Voltaire, and said that the "SPO will always 
defend the right of the SRS to state their opinion," and that 
Seselj and he never had any personal differences but only 
political ones, with the exaggerations that are so typical of 
the Balkan political scene. 
  The "definite" demands by the parliamentary parties are the 
dismissal of Radoman Bozovic and an equal treatment and access 
to television. It is not out of the question that even the 
extraparliamentary parties could join this, "except those that 
have been instrumentalized by the UDBA [State Security 
Administration]," Seselj said. 
  The SRS leader expects that DS leader Zoran Djindjic will 
distance himself from Dragoljub Micunovic, who is "the author of 
the declaration of the Chamber of Citizens." Milan Komnenic 
said that he was sorry that he had voted for the expulsion of 
deputy Drasko Markovic from the session, saying that he only did 
so out of inertia, because he was misinformed about the nature 
of the vote....

  [Text] Belgrade, May 24 (TANJUG) -- The Serbian parliament, 
acting on a motion by the Democratic Party of serbia (DS), will 
soon examine abuses in the privatization process. DS leader 
Zoran Djindjic has submitted to parliament an amendment to the 
law on the conditions and procedure of transforming public 
property, said the DS press office on Tuesday. The amendment 
envisages a revaluation of all deposits made during 1993, when 
annual hyperinflation soared to a record 116 trillion per cent. 
  The DS believes that the abuses in the privatization process 
had taken place during the hyperinflation, because public 
property was sold at a price which was as many as hundred times 
less than its real value. The DS moved that an agency in charge 
of evaluating and revaluating the public capital examine what 
was the price of the shares enterprises had sold to their 
employees. It also proposed that experts determine the value of 
the public capital as against the German mark according to the 
market rate of exchange on the payment date. 
  The privatization process was made official under the 
federal 
law on public capital, adopted in 1990, prior to the 
disintegration of the former Yugoslavia. Serbia and Montenegro, 
who constituted the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992, have 
been enforcing their respective laws on public property 
transformation since 1991.

<F P=106> [Speech by Serbian Minister for Privatization Radoje Djukic </F>
in Cacak on 25 April 1994: "I Am Abolishing `Small Business'"] 
  [Text] Not one government so far has really understood the 
real potential and strength of the private sector, fortunately 
never extinguished, even in the "most communist" times. The germ 
of enterprise has been preserved. With the replacement of the 
political system and the change of climate and attitude in 
Serbia, private initiative has gained momentum. 
  This government and its prime minister realized, however, 
the 
significance and potential of private enterprise in Serbia, and 
formed the Ministry of Private Enterprise. The ministry's goal 
and task is, in a completely new ministry with new people and 
different views and ideas, to promote private business and to 
carry out the necessary institutional changes for that purpose. 
Having that kind of potential and using it poorly is 
inappropriate for a serious state, and we claim to be a serious 
state and to attribute significance to private enterprise, in 
view of the trend toward the transformation of social property 
into private property. The future of Serbia is thus in private 
enterprise. I do not believe that we will use that term 
"private" and "social" any longer, because the "most social" 
person is the one who engages in socially useful work either by 
producing or by providing necessary services to citizens. 
<H5>  Encouraging Production </H5>
  There are now about 186,000 private enterprises and 210,000 
independent craft, commercial, and other shops functioning in 
the Republic of Serbia. Unfortunately for us, fewer than 10 
percent of them are involved in production: 16,000 enterprises 
in industry and mining, 3,800 in construction, 3,000 in 
transportation, and 95,600 in commerce. There is a 
disproportionate ratio between enterprises engaged in production 
and enterprises engaged in commerce, because commerce is in 
effect the superstructure of the production base. There are 
2,700 private enterprises operating in the hotel industry, 4,000 
in crafts and services, and 14,000 in the area of financial and 
other services. 
  The budget of the Republic of Serbia has therefore provided 
for very serious funds to encourage production and development, 
which will be invested through commercial banks in those 
programs and given to those people who will put them to use 
quickly and repay them. 
<H5>  Changes in the Tax System </H5>
  This government inherited a tax system that was never based 
on valid parameters, and so in 1993, during the period of 
hyperinflation, it completely collapsed. The previous 
government, rushing to solve the budget problem, made very, very 
big mistakes in determining the amounts of (?FIRMARINE) and tax 
obligations for entrepreneurs without paying attention to their 
economic strength, or performing the necessary selection, since 
not everyone has the same strength, size, and ability to pay. 
That is even against the constitution. 
  Admittedly, we are applying the laws that are in force, but 
we want to replace them with better ones. Very soon we will send 
the Serbian Assembly a bill that would regulate tax obligations 
differently and selectively. 
  Specifically, we will eliminate the tax on financial 
transactions, but a sales tax that is enormously high will 
remain--27 percent, while for a few goods the tax rate has been 
reduced from 44 to 27 percent, but for most it has been 
increased by 7 percent. That is the reason for the boom of the 
black market in which those who do not pay customs duties, sales 
tax, contributions to employees, etc., work. The state gets 
nothing out of that. 
  My team, however, will prove mathematically that low tax 
rates will contribute higher budget revenue, facilitate 
business, and increase employees' wages--and it will be good for 
everyone. We will do everything analytically with the goal of 
ending this year with the kind of legal and derivative acts that 
will guarantee certainty to everyone to intends to engage in 
business next year. In other words, people will no longer live 
from decree to decree, and the laws will be logical--but 
Serbia's economic regulations consist of 135 legal acts. 
  I would like to see a lawyer who could cope with that, but 
we 
want to create an atmosphere here for the normal, average 
citizen of Serbia. 
  It will be a long-term job, but private businessmen know how 
difficult, arduous, and slow it is to make progress. 
  Don't suspect that your minister will have weak nerves or 
short breath. But remember--that will give us the right to 
establish a strong control function for the state. 
<H5>  Distribution of the "Poorly Distributed" </H5>
  Taxes are not the only problem, however. In fact, a bigger 
problem is the enormous disparity between the number of private 
enterprises and the number of workers employed in them. The 
official data do not give a correct picture. It is true that 
there are more than 300,000 people in Serbia who are working 
"illegally" in the private sector. That is why our goal is not 
only to employ these people legally, but also to correct the 
structure of employees and substantially increase their number. 
We will try to create the kind of environment in which economic 
logic will lead the unemployed to the private sector to seek a 
livelihood there themselves. We will carry out this transition 
painlessly, by adopting appropriate regulations, whose 
implementation will not cause upheavals. I have always said that 
there is not a surplus of employees in this country, but rather 
only poorly distributed ones. 
  In addition to the absolutely abnormal tax system, the 
enormous contributions that are withheld from employees' wages 
also encourage "illegal" work. More than 95 percent of both 
socialized and private enterprises and shops do not show 
salaries realistically through the payroll. Because of the high 
contributions, wages are drastically reduced. Everyone loses. 
  Our goal is to reduce contributions so much that no one will 
have a reason to employ workers "illegally," and we will not be 
very tolerant, because there will no longer be a reason for 
anyone to complain that we have put too much of a burden on him. 
<H5>  Returning Jurisdiction to the Municipalities </H5>
  I know quite well how much the municipalities have been 
crippled by the redistribution of jurisdiction at the republic 
level. One should expect changes along these lines soon, because 
it is unnatural that a municipality does not have insight into 
and influence over the development of the economy in its 
surroundings and on its territory. In fact, it is natural for a 
municipality to be very interested and to be very concerned and 
involved with strengthening the local economy for the purpose of 
raising the standard of living and wages, and developing the 
infrastructure, education, and everything else that constitutes 
the social superstructure for a better and higher-quality life. 
  Furthermore, I have taken the initiative for us to bring 
educated young people from all regions, and then from every 
municipality, to be trained in the Serbian Government, and 
afterwards sent back to rural areas to apply what has been 
learned and agreed upon. 
<H5>  Construction of Small Shops </H5>
  The construction of small shops is our "festering wound." 
City planning conditions and infrastructure are very bad, and 
the corresponding laws and derivative acts resemble an 
impassable forest that has not been cleared since 1967-1971, in 
which not even a highly educated lawyer can find his way, much 
less an average businessman who has to conduct his business. We 
will very soon formulate a draft law that will solve this 
problem in every municipality in Serbia, so that every 
municipality would build a small industrial zone, and create 
opportunities for the rapid construction of production 
facilities. My estimates indicate that in every municipality at 
least 10 people would immediately start construction if given 
the chance, which yields the figure of 2,000 small factories for 
the 200 municipalities in Serbia. I don't have to explain how 
much that means for the construction materials industry, brick, 
iron, insulation material, construction workers.... 
  We are also convinced that every owner of his own small shop 
will seek to develop business and become a serious partner for 
the large enterprises in the socialized sector. The new Law on 
the Transformation of Social Capital, which implies the complete 
independence of socially owned economic entities to choose the 
form of ownership transformation, is also contributing to a good 
atmosphere. 
  Unfortunately, it is a characteristic of our mentality that 
honest people are accused of dishonest intentions, the 
consequence of which will be that entrepreneurs who decide to 
build facilities with a couple of hundred "square meters" will 
continue to make progress faster than those who wait for the 
implementation of this law. I know quite well that this is an 
enslavement of capital, but years will pass before we solve the 
problem through the laws and decrees that we intend to adopt 
soon in order to stimulate this process. Admittedly, there are 
already government decrees on the priority use of unemployed 
production capacities. It is fortunate that the large socialized 
enterprises, on their own initiative, are visiting the smaller 
private firms and seeking a suitable form of cooperation. 
Nevertheless, I think that this form of communication will be 
accelerated soon. 
<H5>  Bringing the Socialized and Private Sectors Closer Together </H5>
  Along those lines, I spoke recently with the director of the 
Belgrade Fair about the idea of having commercial banks organize 
successful private entrepreneurs with whom they are already 
cooperating on the fairgrounds, as part of the traditional 
Entrepreneurs' Fair. As the sponsor of this fair, the government 
has already adopted a decision on a symbolic price for renting 
space in the hall, which the Fair's administration has accepted. 
The purpose is for people from public enterprises to see in one 
place everything that can and must be bought in Serbia from 
producers in the private sector, who, during the blockade, have 
even succeeded in producing incredible things. The task of us in 
the government is to "link" the private and socialized sectors, 
to bring them closer together and refer them to each other. 
  It has also been agreed with Belgrade TV that every day, in 
prime time, it will promote this campaign, so that people 
throughout Serbia will become acquainted with the enormous 
capabilities of our private sector, including that of Cacak. 
<H5>  Imitation of Privatization </H5>
  Public enterprises are one more "festering wound" for the 
Republic of Serbia. Their amorphous nature represents a big 
problem for the Serbian economy, but their ownership 
transformation, which has been carried out to date through the 
distribution of worthless internal papers, constitutes nothing 
more than an imitation of real privatization. That is why it 
will be subject to audit, and a new law on ownership 
transformation, which will sanction those who have exploited 
this process in the most primitive way to steal social property. 
Those who have done this job correctly do not have any reason to 
fear an audit. Furthermore, the budget provides for 
expenditures to "extract" welfare policy from socialized firms, 
which should make it easier for them to begin a different policy 
toward surplus employees. 
<H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5>
  I am abolishing the term "small business," because this 
state 
lives on private entrepreneurs. It no longer lives on the 
Smederevo Steelworks, or EI [Electronics Plant] Nis, but rather 
on us, private businessmen. 
  If 68 percent of employees in the European Union work in 
companies with at most 10 workers, why should we be ashamed of 
small numbers? It seems that we like everything that is big, 
even if it is inefficient. 
  With respect to efficiency, in just the Steelworks, for 
example, 90 percent of its capacity is idle, because of a 
shortage of spare parts. I maintain that our private businessmen 
throughout Serbia can successfully produce 95 percent of the 
missing amounts. Our public enterprises, however, seem to have 
people who will not give 100,000 German marks, for instance, to 
our people, but prefer to give an amount several times higher to 
import the same product from abroad, or to watch trains standing 
motionless. 
<H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5>
<H5>  Monetary Political Institutions </H5>
  I do not consider the banks in which budgetary funds on 
which 
interest is not paid are deposited to be real banks. I am saying 
publicly that they are monetary political institutions. 
<H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5>
<H5>  At Vranje's Side </H5>
  I am extremely delighted by the fact that in the Cacak 
municipality, with 70,000 residents, as many as 43,000 people 
are employed. That is an extremely high employment rate, which 
only Vranje also has in Serbia.

<F P=106> [Article by Verica Dukanac: "Fiscal Tricks"] </F>
  [Text] Two-thirds of the budget expenditures will be 
financed by revenues from the tax on personal incomes and sales 
and excise taxes; to what extent is the impression of this 
year's budget savings by the new government deceptive? What did 
the deputies say about it? 
  In spite of the Assembly discussion for several days about 
the draft law on Serbia's budget, this year's budget was also 
adopted without much tension. The government's starting point in 
setting the volume of public spending, which was publicly 
explained by President Mirko Marjanovic, as well as his finance 
minister, Mr. Dusan Vlatkovic, is that this sort of budget 
projection actually makes a concrete contribution to 
implementing the Program for Reconstruction of the Monetary 
System. The argument is as follows: Since the consolidated 
balance-sheet for public spending for this year in Yugoslavia 
(i.e., the classic budget plus social insurance funds) provided 
for Serbia's right to 6,664 million dinars, or 52 percent of the 
social product, the government of Serbia, "acting frugally and 
rationally," established the volume of public spending at 49.71 
billion dinars (or 30 percent less than the permitted limit), 
which reduced the share of its total public spending, according 
to that calculation, to 42 percent of the social product. 
<H5>  Government's Calculation </H5>
  In fact, the total public revenues are projected to be 41.91 
billion dinars, and public expenditures to be 49.71 billion, 
with the imbalance in its fiscal books, 780 million, to be 
covered by funds from the National Bank of Yugoslavia's reserves 
and by issuing securities. The basic sources for financing the 
republic budget (of 28.60 billion new dinars) are the tax on 
personal incomes and the sales tax and excises. The revenues 
from the tax on personal incomes constitute 33.3 percent of the 
anticipated basic revenues (of a total of 22.37 billion dinars). 
Actually, they were proceeding from an estimate that the average 
wage this year would amount go 63.10 dinars and the guaranteed 
wage, by which the tax base is reduced, 20 dinars. This also 
took into account a reduction in the tax rate on wages from the 
present 30 to 25 percent. 
  The revenues from the sales tax on products and services and 
excise taxes are projected at 37.8 percent of total revenues. 
Those sources, along with the republic's borrowing, 21.8 
percent, constitute 90.9 percent of the basic revenues, so that 
all the others represent a quite minor share in the structure of 
revenues. Thus, for instance, revenues from corporate profit 
taxes are expected to be only 20 million dinars, or 0.7 percent 
of the total. Somewhat more revenues are expected from the tax 
on independent activities (36.72 million, or 1.3 percent), while 
16.50 million dinars, or 0.6 percent of total budget revenues, 
is expected from the property tax. 
  According to the balance-sheet for the republic's budgetary 
expenditures, 16 percent of the total of 28.60 billion dinars is 
planned to be for the wages of employees of state bodies, 18.2 
percent for encouraging development (1.9 percent or 55 million 
for the fund for the lowest wages, and 1.8 percent or 55 million 
dinars in funds for surplus employees), and 14.5 percent or 
414.73 million dinars for other incentives in the economy. The 
funds for exercising republic rights established by law 
constitute 42.6 percent of the total budgetary expenditures, 
primarily for education, science and technology, culture and 
physical education (28.5 percent), as well as social protection 
(3 percent), social care for children (7.9 percent), and 
protection for disabled veterans (1.5 percent). 
  As many as 80 amendments were submitted in the Assembly for 
this draft budget, of which the government submitted four and 
Assembly committees submitted three, while the remaining 73 were 
submitted by 25 deputies. The amendments mostly demanded a 
different distribution of the money, but also additional funds. 
The government complied by approving additional funds for the 
work of the Vojvodina Autonomous Province, 3 million, and then 5 
million each for the highway industry and the railroad, from the 
budget reserves. 
<H5>  Comments and Criticisms </H5>
  If we ignore the favorable attitude of deputies from the 
Socialist Party, which was expressed on this occasion as well 
through truly numerous discussions (but not them alone, because 
a majority was needed to adopt the budget), it remains for us to 
note the points in the discussion that had quite reasonable 
suspicions and comments about this proposal. 
  The first group of those comments should include, above all, 
those pointing out the deceptive impression of frugality, which 
can be reduced to saying that this had to do with a fiscal trick 
and deception, as Mr. Milan Bozic said. It was explained in most 
detail by Mrs. Jorgovanka Tabakovic: "It is claimed here that 
the total volume of public expenditures is 49 billion, about 30 
percent less than the amount projected in the consolidated 
federal balance-sheet. These so-called savings, however, are 
based on the share of the volume of public expenditures in the 
social product, which is obviously overestimated." She said, 
"You could have estimated the social product to be 20 billion, 
and then the share of the volume of public expenditures would 
have been only 25 percent. And that way no one has been 
responsible for the plan and the estimate." At the same time, 
she challenged the position of the government that borrowing 
from the National Bank of Yugoslavia to cover the deficit would 
not be inflationary, claiming that it really could have been 
avoided if the republic had ensured additional real revenues 
from which it would repay the loan. The law itself, however, 
already says that the loans will be used under the conditions 
established by the federal law, which, however, specifies that 
loans to cover budget deficits will only start to be repaid in 
December 1998. The same federal law also reschedules the 
obligations coming due this year on that basis, namely the ones 
from 1987 and 1988. 
  If the foundation of Avramovic's program is a strong dinar 
and a revival of production, then this proposed budget does not 
guarantee the achievement of those goals, through Mrs. Ljiljana 
Lucic, primarily because the main source of revenue is the tax 
on personal incomes, and so it is quite logical to expect that 
the government will not be a serious obstacle to their growth, 
which does not always have to be covered by production and 
earned income--or else that means that the government, in fact, 
does not believe in a revival of economic activity, because the 
planned revenue from profits is minimal. In fact, she sees the 
budget as a collection of requests submitted by various 
ministries, and the government only rationalized them a little, 
since one cannot see from the budget what its program is and 
what its priorities are. Dr. Vladan Batic called attention to 
the fact that the drafting of this budget, except for balancing 
the budget, did not follow certain basic principles, such as the 
principle of publicity, budget accuracy, or the principle of 
budget integrity. He requested that the government not come back 
in a month or two with a request to rebalance the budget, 
especially if there was no inflation. He, and many others, 
pointed out the amount of the funds planned for the police, 
which were several times higher than the amount planned for the 
judicial system. Zivorad Jeremic called attention to another 
inconsistency. Specifically, Avramovic's program uses the figure 
of close to a million people who, as a technological surplus, 
should be the state's concern, but the budget mentions the 
figure of 210,000, and specifies the amount of only 50 million 
dinars for them.

<F P=106> [Report by Jerzy Krajewski: "To Unite Forces, To Confront </F>
Western Banks"] 
  [Text]Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, chairwoman of the 
National Bank of Poland [NBP], is in favor of big banks merging 
into even bigger structures which would be able to compete with 
Western banks in the future. She does not anticipate any 
private bank going bankrupt this year. She approves of the idea 
of allowing shares by all state-owned banks into public 
circulation soon. 
  During a session of the "Club 500" attached to the editorial 
board of ZYCIE GOSPODARCZE yesterday, NBP Chairwoman Hanna 
Gronkiewicz-Waltz spoke in favor of a consolidation of the 
Polish banking system: "The point is not just about merging 
small private banks threatened by bankruptcies, with big ones, 
but also about mergers among big, state-owned banks, so that in 
a few years' time, when Poland joins the European Union, we have 
three to four large structures able to compete with huge Western 
banks" -- she explained. When Andrzej Topinski, chairman of 
General Savings Bank- National Bank noted that there are no 
incentives for such a consolidation, the NBP chairwoman replied: 
"Mergers among large, state-owned banks should be promoted by 
the Finance Ministry which exercises ownership supervision over 
them." According to Gronkiewicz-Waltz, privatization of the 
banks should take place with the participation of foreign 
strategic investors who contribute modern management techniques 
and technologies. 
<H5>  Bankruptcies Not Very Likely </H5>
  According to the NBP chief, one of the reasons for the 
difficult situation of the banking system, was an overly liberal 
policy of granting licenses to banks in the 1990-91 period. 
Over 60 new banks were established then but they are weak from 
a capital standpoint. Scandals involving some of them undermined 
customer confidence in all banks. That is why, over the last 
two years, licenses to open up new banks were granted at a 
slower pace and with more deliberation. Five banks received 
their licenses in 1992, while in 1993, it was just the Polish 
Investment Bank (which arose out of the remnants of NBP's 
commercial part). The criteria for granting concessions were 
also tightened up. 
  The NBP chair does not anticipate a bankruptcy by any 
private 
bank in the immediate future, even though she does not rule out 
such a possibility. NBP intends to spend 3 trillion zlotys this 
year for a program of bringing private banks back to health. 
This should be compared with $6 billion (over 130 trillion 
zlotys) which was spent on saving the banking system in Sweden 
in the 1990s. Gronkiewicz- Waltz was trying to convince the 
banks to display a greater solidarity: "When privately-owned 
banks in some region have troubles, this means a decrease of 
confidence also toward state- owned banks, while generally 
speaking, this also causes a decreased willingness to save 
money" -- she said. 
<H5>  More Openness </H5>
  Boguslaw Kott, chairman of the Bank of Economic Initiatives, 
proposed that state-owned banks implement a procedure soon to 
allow their shares into public circulation. The main purpose of 
such an operation now, would not be the introduction of the 
shares onto the stock market, but to better inform the public 
about the banks' financial situation. Wojciech Kwasniak, NBP's 
representative in the Securities Commission, promised to support 
the idea.

<F P=106> [Report by P.S.: "Fewer Bad Debts -- Bank Gdanski SA in Line </F>
for Privatization"] 
  [Text]Along with Bank Handlowy w Warszawie SA, it is 
the most secure in Poland, it is fourth on the list of main 
activity indicators, and it is fifth in amount of capital -- 
such are the rankings of Bank Gdanski SA. So far, it has had 
just one division in Warsaw, but as of Friday, it also has a 
branch. 
  "The bank is getting ready for privatization. Is is second 
in line after the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy SA" -- 
said Edmund Tolwinski, the bank's chairman. "But first we must 
put some internal things in order and prepare a program. After 
two privatizations of banks of the `Group of Nine,', we want to 
conduct our privatization in the safest possible way." 
  So far, the establishment of an information management 
system 
has been of the main directions of activity. Divisions and 
branches have been computerized for the customers' needs, but 
there is no integrated management system. Availing itself of 
World Bank credits and working in line with its procedures, Bank 
Gdanski will make a decision in June as to who will deal with 
designing and implementing such a system. 
  An extension of the range of activities is another issue. 
Talks with a French insurance group named Azur are already in 
progress. The bank will be selling a few of the group's products 
as its agent before the end of the year, while a joint 
undertaking is being planned for 1995. Its main goal will be 
life insurance. 
  The process of restructuring bad debts has been progressing 
favorably. As the first bank in the country, Bank Gdanski SA 
resolved the problem of difficult credits by selling its 
financial claims. It happened in 1992 and it applied to a debt 
incurred by the Szczecin shipyard which constituted 25 percent 
of Bank Gdanski's "bad credits." For 31 December 1991, such bad 
credits constituted 32.5 percent of the total value of credits. 
On 31 March this year -- the deadline for finalizing the 
restructuring -- the figure dropped down to less than 20 
percent. "The structure of the current difficult debts is 
completely different from that of three years ago" -- said 
Hubert Kierkowski, the bank's deputy chairman for restructuring. 
"Back then, difficult debts were comprised of credits for huge 
state-owned enterprises whereas currently, they are loans 
granted to smaller privately-owned companies." 
  Commenting on rumors regarding a merger with Bank Slaski, 
Chairman Tolwinski stated that some analysis work has been 
conducted but without any specific bank in mind.

<F P=106> [Article by Zbigniew Grzegorzewski: "The Medicine of </F>
Commercialization; There Will Be Fewer Disputes Among Chiefs of 
Economic Ministries; Position of Managers of Deficit-Stricken 
Enterprises Will Be Weakened"] 
  [Text]By the end of 1998, there will be no more 
state-owned enterprises in Poland -- such is supposed to be the 
result of a government-adopted commercialization program. The 
Ministry of Ownership Transformations [MPW] will gain in 
importance -- it will no longer have to listen to what 
foundation organs [organy zalozycielskie] have to say. 
  The most important part about the commercialization program 
is that a shape of the ultimate, future model of the Polish 
economy has been defined with some precision. For the first 
time, the program suggests separating the flow of revenue from 
income. Revenue from privatization would go not just to the 
state budget. A restructuring path is to be established in 
industries, supervised not by the state administration, but a 
trust agency based on commercial principles. And that is more 
important than the fact that state-owned enterprises -- through 
commercialization -- will be transformed into Treasury-owned 
joint-stock companies [JSSP]. 
  There are still about 5,300 state-owned enterprises, but not 
all of them are to be covered by the commercialization. Small 
enterprises will be excluded, due to the cost of such a 
transformation -- they are supposed to be simply sold as soon as 
possible. 
<H5>  Not for the Weak Ones </H5>
  What is more important, the commercialization will not cover 
those enterprises whose funds are negative (or at zero level) as 
it is impossible to establish a company in which the capital 
would not be effectively covered -- this would be against the 
Code of Commerce. 
  The program clearly suggests -- even though it happens 
through dispersed provisions -- that enterprises will no longer 
be so easily bypassed by bankruptcy proceedings. According to 
the changes being proposed, notions of a mandatory and 
non-mandatory bankruptcy will appear in the law on state-owned 
enterprises. The mandatory type of bankruptcy is supposed to 
take place when the value of the property being given away for 
usage exceeds half the financial resources of the enterprise. 
It means more radical policies toward those companies that have 
reported profit, not through production, but through the leasing 
of national wealth. 
<H5>  Managers, Beware! </H5>
  An attempt to have the enterprises financially disciplined 
is 
also demonstrated by the proposal that foundation organs be 
empowered to recall those managers who conduct irrational 
policies, and also -- perhaps even more important -- those who 
resist declaring bankruptcy. 
  MPW's position would also be stronger as a decision on 
commercialization could be undertaken without the consent of the 
enterprise's organs, and even without the consent of the 
foundation organ. If this were to be implemented, the recent 
dispute between Ministers Kaczmarek and Pol (and two other 
ministry chiefs) would not happen again; the dispute created a 
danger that privatization might go in different directions, 
depending on the ministries' policies. 
  Instead of collecting a capital tax (so-called interest 
rates 
on JSSP's capital) which is completely detached from company 
profit, the State Treasury is supposed to derive income from 
dividends on profit. The dividends for the budget would be 
divided (it is not known yet in what ratios). A part of them 
should be reinvested, and destined for a restructuring of 
JSSP's. That should not be dealt with by MPW, but by agencies 
operating on commercial principles. 
  When it comes to enterprises, the decision on whether to 
accept the commercialization program could be determined by the 
proposition that the enterprises be able to decrease their 
initiation capital by the value of redundant property, and then 
to just bear the cost of securing the property. But at another 
point, it is mentioned that a transfer of redundant property to 
the State Treasury will be possible. May it be only in those 
cases where the State Treasury will think that it may somehow 
use the property, otherwise the taxpayers will feel the impact. 
  Only after deliberating on these consequences of a massive 
commercialization, can one mention the obvious: In developed 
market economies, there are no state-owned enterprises (with 
employee boards), but there are instead companies based on the

Politicians and Journalists Do Not Think Highly of Each Other"] 
  [Text]There is no agreement among politicians about 
professional television journalists. According to some 
politicians, the journalists are professional and thorough, 
while other politicians accuse television journalists of bias, 
superficiality, and sensation seeking. 
  For a few months now, there has been a spirited argument 
going on among politicians as to the assessment of the new 
public television management, but that is not the only theme of 
the argument. Another one is something much more tangible -- 
assessments of the degree of professionalism of television 
journalists. 
  According to Jan Litynski of the Freedom Union, in recent 
times, the level of reporting and of television news programs 
has much improved and he says it is "quite high." In his view, 
the commentaries and reports are professional and describe well 
the essence of the political event in question. 
  While Litynski's only complaint concerns constant changes in 
the arrangement of television studios, Jerzy Wiatr of the 
Democratic Left Alliance has some more serious accusations to 
levy. In his view, the general level of professionalism 
displayed by television journalists, is low. "There are 
instances of professional, intelligent, and unbiased 
journalists" -- Wiatr lists Andrzej Morozowski as one of them -- 
"but there are also many very bad ones." He adds that the level 
is much below the capabilities that exist in Poland and that is 
because many valuable people are removed. 
  In Wiatr's opinion, the main "sin" of television journalists 
is not political prejudice but superficiality. In contrast to 
their Western colleagues, Polish journalists are often times 
poorly prepared to handle the topics they have been assigned. 
They often try to cover up this ignorance with engaging in 
polemics or even with a certain degree of aggressive behavior. 
  According to Litynski, television journalists are not 
biased. 
Even if one can be critical regarding, for instance, the 
composition of a panel of guests invited to some political talk 
show, there is no bias in that whatsoever. Wiatr in turn thinks 
that often, errors in journalistic work do not indicate simply a 
lack of professionalism but also bias. 
  Tomasz Nalecz of the Union of Labor has high praise 
concerning television journalists. True, he thinks they engage 
in too much sensation seeking (a report about a Sejm deputy who 
caused an accident after having drunk two beers is more 
important than a significant decision by the Sejm) but he adds 
immediately that the team of journalists servicing the Sejm is 
fully competent and professional. 
  Nalecz is outraged at the decision to suspend Grzegorz 
Miecugow for failure to include a report on the president's 
return from Estonia in "Wiadomosci" [main television newscast]. 
Nalecz thinks Miecugow was right in his decision. 
  "This proves that we still do not have a purely information- 
oriented type of journalism" -- Nalecz says. "But I do not 
condemn journalists because a short leash has always been 
applied to them."

<F P=106> [Article by Piotr Smilowicz: "Professionals or Bunglers?; </F>
Politicians and Journalists Do Not Think Highly of Each Other"] 
  [Text]Television journalists agree that a majority of 
politicians do not know how to present their views in front of 
the camera. But what they do know how to do, is to pressure 
television and blame it for the politicians' negative media 
image. 
  "Politicians have major problems in communicating what they 
have to say. As a general rule, it is hard to make them provide 
concise statements that would be within the time limit they have 
been assigned" -- says Adam Pieczynski, chief of "Wiadomosci" 
[main television newscast]. He adds that because television has 
to cut out some of the material (which is necessary in such 
cases), it makes television information programs vulnerable to 
the accusation of manipulating politicians. 
  Piotr Zaremba, chief of the news department of Polish 
Television's Channel 1, agrees with the view: "There are very 
few politicians who are able to communicate their thoughts 
succinctly and appropriately" -- Zaremba notes. 
  According to him, there are no more than a handful of 
political activists who come through well on television -- he 
lists Ryszard Bugaj, Aleksander Kwasniewski, and Kazimierz 
Ujazdowski. 
  "From among the political parties, politicians for the 
Democratic Left Alliance definitely know best how to present 
themselves on television. It is clear that they have worked on 
their statements to ensure that they are concise, and without a 
tone of aggression or holding something against somebody" -- 
Zaremba says. But when it comes to politicians for the Polish 
Peasant Party, Zaremba says they portray themselves much worse. 
  "They do not know how to act in front of the camera, they 
are 
embarrassed and shy. Their bad image is later explained with 
television's alleged dislike of them" -- Zaremba says. 
  "My assessment of politicians' capability to present 
themselves on television is a `C minus'" -- says Wiadomosci's 
Tomasz Lis. He adds that he is bothered by the fact that 
politicians do not understand the rules governing television or 
what the viewers expect from it. "A politician for the 
coalition proposes time-slots for the government in prime time. 
He does not understand the disastrous effect this may have both 
for him and for television's image" -- Lis says. In his view, 
the current pressures exerted on television may cause a loss of 
its credibility which has been worked on so hard over the past 
four years. 
  Piotr Zaremba also agrees with the view that politicians do 
not understand the rules governing television: "Recently, the 
`Convention' program was taken off the television schedule. In 
it, representatives of a few political parties spoke out, and it 
was broadcast on Friday evenings. The program was very poorly 
made and its audience was at zero level. But its elimination 
caused massive protests by various parties -- mainly from 
outside parliament -- to the effect that the last place from 
which they can address society, is being taken away from them. 
This is proof of a complete lack of understanding the fact that 
in order to address viewers, one must first get their attention" 
-- Zaremba says.

  [Excerpts] A new copyright law comes into force in Poland 
today. Illegal producers of cassettes, records, or computer 
programs can now be fined or even receive prison sentences. 
Just last year, out of a total of 65 million records and 
cassettes sold on the market, as many as 90 percent were pirate 
recordings. [passage omitted] 
  Illegally produced cassettes of Polish music cost 20,000 to 
30,000 zloty. Cassettes with foreign music cost 60,000 zloty. 
Beginning today, all records and cassettes will have to bear 
special holograms, and they will cost two to three times more 
than before. [passage omitted] 
  World record producers made over 30 billion dollars in 
profits last year. In Poland, such profits amounted only to 66 
million [currency not specified]. The reason for such small 
profits was the activity of illegal producers. Record company 
profits were reduced even further by the existence of compact 
disc libraries, as records borrowed from the library could be 
rerecorded on cassettes. [passage omitted] 
  The authors of literary or musical works, or their 
inheritors, will obtain royalties for 50 years, as opposed to 
the 25 years envisaged by the law until now. Offenders who 
break the copyright law--for example, by illegally producing and 
copying books, records, cassettes, or computer programs--may be 
punished with high fines or even sentenced to prison for up to 
five years.

  [Text] Knin, 23 May (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president of 
the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], today received Enrico 
Agiliar, head of the civilian affairs section for UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] in Sector South, and proposed to him that 
UNPROFOR should take over the handling of the resumption of 
talks between Krajina and Croatia. Martic expressed 
dissatisfaction over the way this has been handled by Gehrt 
Ahrens and Kai Eide, deputy cochairmen of the conference on the 
former Yugoslavia, and proposed that Yasushi Akashi, the UN 
secretary-general's special envoy in Yugoslavia, take over as 
the coordinator to bring about the resumption of talks. 
  According to a statement by the RSK president's office, the 
two deputy cochairmen have acted as mediators in a tendentious 
and one-sided [as received] way and and have, in fact, only been 
passing on Croatian demands to the republic of Serb Krajina. 
President Martic said that mediation by a neutral and objective 
diplomat such as Yasushi Akashi would certainly produce certain 
results and would speed up the negotiating process between Knin 
and Zagreb.

  [Text] Pristina, (BETA) -- Stipe Mesic, chairman of the 
Chamber of Deputies of the Croatian Assembly, stated for the 
latest edition of ZERI, the Pristina weekly in Albanian, that 
the so-called Republic of Kosovo was proclaimed by "the legal 
and legitimate parliament" in that region. 
  Mesic believes it would be "perfectly logical" if "the 
republic of Kosovo" were to have its representative and an 
office in Zagreb. According to Mesic, the war between the 
Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina was "absurd" since 
both sides have "a common enemy -- the Serbs." Asked whether 
Croatia will be able to incorporate the territory of the 
republic of Serbian Krajina, Mesic said that first the Serbs in 
Krajina would have to be "politically defeated." 
  "The most important thing is for the international community 
to isolate Milosevic completely and to close off all the bridges 
and roads via which Serbia supplies the Serb army in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with weapons," Mesic said. Mesic also said 
that due to forceful pressure from Belgrade, Croatia had to ban 
the news program in Albanian on Croatian Radio.

    [Editorial Report] Two Croatian dailies, Zagreb VJESNIK 
and Split SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, reported in their 2 May issues on 
a 30 April meeting in Zagreb at which breakaway members of the 
ruling Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ) founded a new party, 
the Croatian Independent Democrats (HND). 
  "Our appearance on the Croatian political scene restores 
belief in democracy in Croatia," Croatian Parliament President 
Stjepan Mesic stated in his opening speech (VJESNIK; SLOBODNA 
DALMACIJA). Explaining the establishment of the new party, he 
added: "The HND has appeared on the Croatian stage because of a 
crisis that has afflicted the process of democratization of 
Croatian society and the system of governing by the ruling party 
and the Croatian state." According to SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, Mesic 
said that a "rift" had occurred at the Second Assembly of the 
HDZ in October 1993 and that advocates of a "military approach 
to the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina" and of "authoritarian rule," 
who sought to limit democracy in Croatia, had prevailed. Under 
conditions of war, VJESNIK cites Mesic as stating, "one could 
and had to tolerate authoritarian rule over state affairs from a 
single center," but now everyone was asking for democratization. 
  Listed below are the goals and policies of the HND that 
Mesic 
laid out in his speech, as reported in the VJESNIK and SLOBODNA 
DALMACIJA accounts: 
  - Separation of power into three branches of government; 
  - Freedom of the media; 
  - Protection of minorities and respect for human rights; 
  - Majority rule and a Western-style parliamentary system; 
  - Decentralization of power through the strengthening of 
local administration and self-management to "promote regional 
particularism"; 
  - Integration of Croatia into European "trends"; 
  - Promotion of peace; 
  - Unchangeability of borders; 
  - Decrease in the level of armaments in the area; 
  - Support of Bosnia-Herzegovina's integrity and the 
Washington agreement establishing the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
federation; 
  - Rejection of Serbia's right to intervene in the "so-called 
krajina" issue and cooperation with Serbia only after its 
recognition of Croatia within its internationally recognized 
borders; 
  - Closer relations with Slovenia; 
  - Taking into account "Montenegro's individuality"; 
  - Development of relations with Islamic, nonaligned, and 
Mediterranean countries; 
  - Denationalization; 
  - Rapid privatization; 
  - Decreased state influence on the economy and free 
enterprise; 
  - Restoration of the dignity of peasants; 
  - Social welfare and care for refugees and war invalids; and 
  - A modern educational system. 
  SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported that Mesic was elected HND 
president, receiving 191 of a possible 197 votes, and that Josip 
Manolic, Tomislav Duka, Slavko Degoricija, Perica Juric, and 
Dragutin Hlad were elected vice presidents. Darko Hrastovec was 
elected the party's secretary. The following persons were 
elected to the HND Presidency: Stanislav Pavic, Pero Kriste, 
Romano Bolkovic, Leticija Drndic-Antolic, Andjelko Sikiric, 
Dalibor Kovacevic, Emanuel Justament, Ante Sare, and Josip 
Zebic. A 15-member Executive Council and a 5-member Supervisory 
Council were also elected. 
  After the founding meeting, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reported, the 
HND leaders held a news conference. Stipe Mesic refused to 
answer a question about how many members the new party had, 
explaining that "the people are going through the wringer, and 
great pressure is being exerted on them." When journalists 
pressed for information on what kinds of pressures were involved 
and on whom they were being exerted, Josip Manolic responded 
that "people were summoned during the night for talks with the 
president, during which there were offers and a few threats." 
  Manolic stated that the HND was already the second-largest 
opposition party in the Assembly, adding that "differentiation" 
with the HDZ had just begun and will last until the 
disintegration of the HDZ, the abolition of the "one-man 
monopoly," and the establishment of a political monitoring of 
the government by the opposition. 
  In reply to numerous questions about the HND's support for 
increased regionalization, Mesic said that the new party 
advocates such plans when they are responsive to regional 
individuality and needs. Slavko Degoricija maintained that the 
territorial division of Croatia into 22 counties was artificial 
and that, historically, it would be more justified to set up 
eight to nine regions and to develop regionalism that would 
contribute to the integrity of Croatia. The VJESNIK account of 
the news conference reported that Croatian Assembly deputies who 
had joined the HND said they did not intend to give up their 
Assembly seats. VJESNIK also noted that Mesic stressed that the 
balance of power in the Assembly with regard to Croatia's 
Bosnia-Herzegovina policy had been altered by the establishment 
of the HND. In contrast to what he claimed was Tudjman's policy 
of partitioning Bosnia between Croatia and the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia, Mesic supported an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Article by Marko Franjic: "Economy on State Reservation"] </F>
  [Text] If enterprises under majority state ownership had 
clear strategic goals and if management were responsible for 
their operations, the type of problems that have emerged 
surrounding the government's decision on banning sponsorship 
would be impossible. 
  At one of its recent meetings, the government of the 
Republic 
of Croatia discussed, among other things, a ban on state-owned 
enterprises being sponsors, because according to government 
officials some budget beneficiaries have compensated for the 
lack of money following consolidation of the state budget 
through sponsorships. As these sponsorship funds originate from 
state enterprises, many of which are money-losing ventures, the 
government decided to ban sponsorship by enterprises where it is 
the majority owner. The competent ministries must reexamine all 
sponsorship agreements in order to gain insight into the 
dimensions of this "form of siphoning off funds," as the 
government described it. 
  The somewhat unusual and unexpected decision by the 
government comes at an inauspicious time, because the situation 
has become exacerbated with the strike by education workers. 
Those involved in cultural affairs felt that they are hardest 
hit by this government move, and they reacted to it immediately, 
while athletes, who perhaps will actually be hardest hit by the 
sponsorship ban, were simply caught off guard. This government 
decision has intensified certain old economic problems that are 
detrimental to the market development of the Croatian economy, 
for which the government still has no solution, although its 
officials contend that they do. To be sure, these are public 
enterprises and state-owned enterprises. Although through the 
decision the government has once again affirmed that it is ready 
to fully and decisively implement a stabilization program, even 
adopting such ad hoc decisions if it senses that its goals are 
threatened, tensions have mounted to a red-hot state while the 
weaknesses in managing state enterprises have not been resolved. 
If they had been, the government would not be in the position of 
accountant for public enterprises; instead, the management would 
be responsible for its operations. 
<H5>  No Strategy </H5>
  The government's moves show that there is no development 
strategy for these enterprises, whose position in the economy is 
almost of crucial importance, nor are there projections of their 
future position. Moreover, it appears that the tacit social 
consensus that the government enjoyed is slowly being drawn into 
question. Even now it is becoming clear what this consensus has 
meant to it in the implementation of the stabilization policy, 
even though statements by union leaders have long provided an 
indication of their disappointment with the government's 
belittlement of its social partners. The government contributed 
to a great extent to the eruption of the strike by education 
workers and to the protest by cultural workers through its 
arrogant and intolerant behavior, only to resolve all issues 
through negotiations, which should have been attempted even 
before the strike. 
  In sponsorship, the government sensed the possibility of 
budget breaches. Valentic recently explained to businessmen and 
the public that he must insist on the budget adopted by the 
Assembly, without breaches in a single item on the outlay side, 
and that position is being followed blindly. However, such a 
decision--seemingly resolute and perhaps even appropriate--is 
more of an indication of all the problems of government 
relations with public enterprises and the lack of strategic 
guidance for the Croatian economy, in which the state defines 
its interests and priorities, than it is a reflection of resolve 
in the pursuit of economic policy. 
  Four years ago, when it was decided to found 11 public 
enterprises under state authority based on a special societal 
interest, a major inclination by the new state to control all 
significant economic subjects was discernible, but at the time 
it was not realistic to expect that an economic strategy would 
be known precisely. Over four years' time, however, only Astra 
has departed from that select group, and nothing significant has 
happened in the government's policy toward those enterprises. In 
addition, the state has become the majority owner of a large 
part of the Croatian economy that has undertaken transformation 
even though it was expected that with the privatization of the 
rest of the economy the public enterprises too would gradually 
begin privatizing. 
<H5>  Administrative Committees </H5>
  The public enterprises are very important: One-third of the 
capital of the Croatian economy and 13 percent of all employees 
were concentrated in these 10 enterprises when they became 
public, and they accounted for 11 percent of all revenues. 
Although all governments have emphasized their importance, and 
some--such as the Sarinic government--have declared the 
resolution of their status to be a top priority, key problems 
have remained in relations with these enterprises, which is 
unacceptable precisely because of the proclaimed greater 
interest, but also because of their position on the market. The 
majority of them are monopolies, but for some this is not a 
natural position. 
  The state was supposed to manage the enterprises through 
administrative committees. The way in which functions in the 
administrative committees were understood in our country is 
largely well-known, as is the fact that they did not work on 
strategy and on defining economic policy at the enterprises, nor 
was their relationship to the state specified. It is interesting 
to observe how the administrative committees operate based on 
the example of the Fund for Privatization [HFP]. At the 
beginning of privatization, the fund's administrative committee 
had seven members because transformation was not regarded as 
essential, except declaratively. When privatization got into 
full swing, the number of members rose to 11, but now that 
everyone has realized that privatization is an essential process 
there are 13 members of the administrative committee, while the 
employers' association has demanded that one of its members be 
admitted to the fund's administrative committee. Judging from 
the new acquisitions (Ivic Pasalic), it is clear that these 
expansions of committee membership are politically motivated, 
and it can hardly be expected that it will formulate a strategy 
for development of the Croatian economy. 
  Right now it can be said that the state has not pursued a 
consistent policy toward the public enterprises. There is no 
obligation to realize profits and to transfer them to the state 
budget; some enterprises are exempt from payments of taxes on 
profits, while some are not; some cover losses from the budget, 
while some do not, even when the loss is the result of an 
administrative restriction, etc. To be sure, there cannot be a 
uniform model in dealing with them, because their roles and 
positions in the economy differ, but there must be a strategy 
with defined goals. The overall goal of economic policy must be 
stability and growth, which will be achieved by increasing 
business efficiency, and it has long been clear that private 
enterprises conduct business much more efficiently. 
<H5>  Return of "Write-Offs" </H5>
  Of major importance to the economy of any state is how big 
companies conduct business, especially if they are state-owned. 
Over the past three years (from 1991 to 1993), the state has 
helped out Croatian Railroads [HZ] with subsidies amounting to 
approximately 950 million German marks [DM], but in those three 
years HZ has operated with additional losses of around DM220 
million, which means that more than DM1.1 billion has been spent 
on the railroads. The projected subsidy for this year is around 
DM290 million, but the situation is not improving. On the 
contrary: There have already been strikes and political affairs 
(Kralj, Seks) at HZ, and the HZ Independent Union recently sent 
a scathing letter to Prime Minister Valentic concerning 
detrimental contracts (allegedly, HZ has been harmed to the tune 
of around DM10 million from only three contracts with private 
enterprises). Strong opposition to the involvement of Josip 
Bozicevic, former minister of trade and communication, in the 
management of HZ was also expressed. 
  The letter from the union includes the following: "We regard 
the return of those who have been `written off' to the top 
management of HZ, led by Mr. Bozicevic (65 years old), as an 
attempt to cover up and conceal plunder and pillage at HZ, and 
as the return of a nebulous and hopeless state at Croatian 
Railroads." Although the government has introduced a new bill on 
railroads that proposes solving the railroad problem in three 
stages, and although railroads are subsidized everywhere in 
Europe except in Sweden, it appears that the proposed personnel 
solutions will be problematic: Experts have also expressed their 
reservations toward this solution, and it appears that the 
railroad issue will remain very painful for every Croatian 
government for some time to come. 
  Of the 10 public enterprises, only NARODNE NOVINE and the 
HPT 
[Croatian Post and Telephone] are operating in the black, while 
Croatian Forests is close to it; besides the railroads, 
Jadrolinija--which the government is helping with subsidies--and 
the Croatian Electric Power Industry are operating in the red. 
The others are borderline, operating at the "break-even point," 
whereby INA [Petroleum Refining and Sales Enterprise] is 
eliciting an outcry because of its continued special status, 
while there are those who have said that INA has its own 
mini-state budget, although the other public enterprises are not 
far from that either. All these enterprises have experienced 
various affairs, and there have also been strikes in them. In 
this atmosphere and given the unclear state strategy and the 
imprecise and undefined goals, it has not even been possible for 
public enterprises to operate any better. The government of 
Nikica Valentic has also formed an Office for Economics and 
Restructuring of Public Enterprises, which is responsible for 
monitoring the economic efficiency of public enterprises and for 
their restructuring. 
<H5>  Incest With Banks </H5>
  Minister Zlatko Matesa has also touched on the especially 
sensitive subject of relations between public enterprises, but 
also other major, problematic enterprises (e.g., 
agricultural-food combines, shipbuilding, iron and steel works), 
and banks. It has been proposed that the "incestuous" relations, 
in which these enterprises are the banks' biggest debtors, but 
at the same time their co-owners and members of their 
administrative committees, be resolved through a sort of swap of 
stock among the state, the banks, and the enterprises, but for 
now this is only an idea. 
  The Office for Reconstruction first dealt with INA, perhaps 
because the head of the office, Milan Ujevic, also works at INA, 
for which it was proposed that it be a joint-stock company under 
state ownership, and afterwards models for the railroads were 
also proposed. What should be most important is the onset of 
serious restructuring of these enterprises and their at least 
partial privatization, which is possible in the majority of 
public enterprises. 
  Croatian Post and Telephone, the value of which HFP 
president 
Penic has estimated at DM6 billion, is a very promising 
enterprise that operates well, although the price of connections 
and pulses has dropped while investments have been made in 
establishing 600,000 new connections. However, that is still a 
far cry from European standards, especially in the price of 
connections, but partial privatization of HPT could provide 
significant resources and thus further improve operations. The 
same is true of NARODNE NOVINE. Moreover, although the majority 
have rejected such variants, even HRT [Croatian Radio and 
Television] could be partially privatized if the political will 
to do so existed. 
<H5>  Smothered Initiative </H5>
  However, it is clear that the state will not decide in favor 
of more substantial moves to privatize this sphere, and even if 
it did, such moves would be very gradual. Because of this, it is 
very important to specify and define the relationship between 
the state and the public enterprises and the manner in which 
these enterprises will be led. Setting out strategic goals for 
these enterprises and appointing a management that will execute 
them with clear authorities and responsibilities would make the 
government's job appreciably easier; then it would not be an 
administrator and accountant for public enterprises, but rather 
a genuine owner who knows what it wants. 
  In that case, there would also be no problems with 
sponsorship, because an enterprise would have a marketing budget 
which, as everywhere, must serve the objective of the best 
possible business results, for which the management of the 
enterprise would be responsible to the government. Centralized 
administration of the kind exhibited by our enterprises, 
according to studies, leads to poorer business results, which 
has long since been recognized in the rest of the world. 
Although the government must keep certain things under control 
during the implementation phase of the stabilization program, 
centralization in guiding the economy will certainly be 
counterproductive, because a big, bureaucratic state apparatus 
is created that smothers business initiative, and the government 
increasingly concerns itself with everyday business affairs to 
the detriment of strategic decisions and especially to the 
detriment of the creation of legislation and business 
regulations that will permit economic growth and development.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 23 (AFP) -- Sergio Vieira de Mello, 
the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] civil affairs director in 
ex-Yugoslavia, is scheduled to meet Monday [23 May] with Bosnian 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic to discuss the application of UN 
Resolution 913 on Gorazde. Silajdzic, in a television interview 
Sunday, questioned the UN's credibility saying that "in terms of 
Gorazde, where everything had started off well with a NATO 
ultimatum, these UN measures were successful in delaying 
everything to the point where it has practically become a joke. 
If they are not capable of doing something in Gorazde, how 
could they on a larger scale," he said, adding that as a result 
the Bosnian government would cautiously enter into the next 
round of negotiations.

  [Excerpt] The tragic outcome of the terrorist attack by 
the chetnik artillery on the free Brcko territory last night is 
three dead and a dozen or so wounded civilians. After 
provocative attacks on the positions of the Brcko defense 
yesterday, last night, at 1945, the enemy launched a fierce 
artillery attack. Using mortars of all caliber, recoilless 
guns, howitzers, and the T-12 gun, the aggressor shelled our 
positions between Ljukici and Kladije [words indistinct] 
Omerbegovaca and Vranovaca with destructive projectiles. 
  Unable to change anything at the impenetrable defense lines, 
at 2015, the chetniks turned their artillery in a criminal 
fashion toward civilian targets deep toward the free Brcko 
territory. The aggressor mercilessly attacked unarmed civilians 
and houses on free Brcko territory with 122-mm and 155-mm 
howitzers, 122-mm mortars, and hill guns for a whole hour.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 23 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem authorities 
in Vares on Monday banned free movement of Croat civilians on 
the entire territory of the town in central Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
As reported by Croatian radio, Croat civilians were also banned 
from entering or leaving Vares. 
  The local Bosnian Croat army command requsted mediation of 
the United Nations peacekeepers (UNPROFOR), said the radio. 
Vares, a mining town which had a majority Croat population 
before the war, was seized by the Moslem army last autumn. 
  Around 10,000 Croats expelled from the town have sought 
shelter in the territory of the Serb republic, the state of the 
Bosnian Serbs. The relations between the Bosnian Croats and 
Moslems have become tense on the terrain and the number of 
incidents is growing while the leaderships of the two Bosnian 
ethnic communities are preparing a formal proclamation of a new, 
Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia on May 30. The agreement on 
forming a Moslem-Croat federation was reached under strong 
pressure of the United States. 
  For a whole year before their abrupt reconciliation in 
march, 
the two sides were engaged in bloody fighting for territories 
with mixed population in the central and southern parts of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Zhelyu Zhelev by Adam Michnik; </F>
place and date not given; "published simultaneously" in Warsaw 
GAZETA WYBORCZA; "Union of Democratic Forces Failed To Convince 
the Public of the Need for Reforms"] 
  [Text] [Michnik] Mr. President, this is our fourth 
conversation since you assumed office. How would you assess the 
balance of these four years of change in Bulgaria? 
  [Zhelev] However discontented we may be, however 
disappointed with our original expectations, nevertheless major 
changes have occurred in Bulgaria that give grounds for 
believing that there can be no going back. Among the 
comparatively new developments, I should mention that the war in 
former Yugoslavia is exerting an increasingly strong effect on 
our country. Bulgaria is being seriously affected by this war. 
We are playing no part in it, except for observing the embargo 
and the sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council. 
Militarily speaking, we are playing no part whatsoever, because 
we know that any form of intervention, even of the most noble 
kind, even if we were to send "blue helmets," would be regarded 
as some kind of revanchism, as political self-seeking, or as 
part of far-reaching plans. 
  However, we are really affected by the war, most heavily by 
our losses from the embargo. Our door to the West is simply 
closed to us. According to our calculations, so far we have 
lost over $3 billion in unrealized contracts, share values, and 
so on. The second thing that is affecting us is the appearance 
of a petroleum mafia in Bulgaria. Smuggling gasoline and 
naphtha across our western border brings the criminals huge 
profits, because over there every liter is worth 10 times more. 
  We are also affected by the absence of foreign investment. 
The investors are scared because a war is in progress on the 
other side of the border. They simply try to circumvent the 
Balkans. Thus, we are becoming a high-risk country through no 
fault of our own. 
  [Michnik] The SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] brought you 
to power. What is happening at the moment inside the SDS 
coalition? 
  [Zhelev] In my view the SDS has made a number of very 
serious mistakes. After winning the 1991 elections, it had a 
parliamentary majority and ruled the country together with the 
DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms]. However, later they 
retreated and lost position after position. After the 
resignation of Filip Dimitrov's government and after the 
resignation of the vice president [Blaga Dimitrova], the SDS was 
without power, although the electors had voted for it. 
  [Michnik] Why did the SDS "give up" power? 
  [Zhelev] Personal and group interests played a part, but to 
this one should add the lack of breadth in their political 
thinking. 
  [Michnik] One can observe the process of disintegration of 
the anti-communist coalitions in all the countries of the former 
socialist camp. Do you think, Mr. President, that this cannot 
be attributed only to personal conflicts? 
  [Zhelev] Among other things, more profound reasons lie 
behind the different interests of the various participants in 
the process of the reforms. To sum up in the most general 
terms, in the beginning we had ideals. Our banner consisted of 
democracy, the market economy, and a rule-of-law state. The 
people accepted all of this and voted for it. We we came to 
start the economic reforms, economic interests then came to the 
forefront, and they in turn are interwoven with the personal 
ambitions of activists and functionaries in various 
institutions. Subsequently, alliances were formed that no one 
could have foreseen. In parliament, for example, there are 
deputies in opposing groups that are linked to certain business 
groups, and they sometimes vote together, for example on 
taxation issues. This is the reason why we still have no laws 
on fiscal police or an audit office. The common platform with 
which the parties, movements, trade unions, and associations 
forming the SDS fought the elections was a compromise. 
Compromises always have to be brought up to date. I think that 
the SDS leaders forgot this principle at a certain moment. Even 
worse, the SDS failed to convince the public of the need for the 
reforms. It failed to convince the public that the SDS is a 
national force that identifies itself with national interests. 
The coalition left this very important area in the hands of the 
BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], which talks all the time about 
Bulgaria, the national cause, and so on. 
  [Michnik] Do the SDS leaders realize this today? 
  [Zhelev] Some of them claim that in the next elections the 
SDS will win over 50 percent of the votes. This is absolute 
utopia. 
  [Michnik] People tell me that the Communists brought people 
like Zhelyu Zhelev to power. They claim that you do not 
understand reality, that you are a utopian humanist or even a 
cryptocommunist. In Poland people are saying the same things 
about the people who opposed the decommunizing laws. 
  [Zhelev] The Communists in Bulgaria are restoring their 
strength, but the opponents of decommunization are not to blame 
for this. They are exploiting the fact that they are the main 
force that supports the present government, which is formally a 
nonparty one. In exchange for their support, they demand 
various concessions that stall the reforms. For example, they 
want to recall diplomats who obtained their posts in the Foreign 
Ministry after 1989. They are trying to reinstall in the 
Foreign Ministry the so-called professional staff, but you know 
what kind of professionals these are! 
  The BSP is regaining its lost positions. The SDS is most to 
blame for this, because it disowned its allies and relinquished 
its changes of its own accord. When the other side retreats, 
you are stupid if you fail to exploit the situation. 
  [Michnik] Do the Communists want the return of communism? 
  [Zhelev] Some of them do, such as the authors of the 
concepts for forming farming cooperatives before the land is 
returned to its owners. However, there are others who are 
evolving in a social democratic direction; they believe that the 
ideas of the first group are stupid. They know there is no 
alternative to the transition to the market economy, but want 
their party to govern this process independently. For them, the 
main question is where the capitalists are to come from, from 
the BSP or the SDS? Who will receive the property? Who will 
get the money? They do not think of ideals, only of property 
and money. From the viewpoint of the national interest, it 
would be better if the SDS carried out the reforms. The SDS will 
complete them more quickly and in a more radical manner. 
Because of its nomenklatura, the BSP will try to preserve the 
remnants of the old regime as long as possible, but in the final 
event they will collapse. 
  [Michnik] I have heard a hypothesis that the chaos in 
Bulgaria is being made worse by those who support the idea that 
dictatorship is the only solution to the chaos. 
  [Zhelev] Groups do indeed exist in Bulgaria that are 
interested in chaos. Chaos benefits certain circles in the BSP 
that want to prove that the present version of the reforms is 
against the country's interest. Business groups that have links 
with the mafia feel very comfortable in the present chaos, 
because they gain from this situation. They can carry out 
illicit privatization and they can ship fuel illegally to former 
Yugoslavia. A further group that is striving to destabilize the 
state consists of people from the former State Security, who 
have found their true place and calling in the mafia and in 
business. 
  [Michnik] How did it come about that the people who 
previously fought for democracy are now thirsting for power and 
are open to corruption? This is happening everywhere, not only 
in Bulgaria. 
  [Zhelev] In Bulgaria only a handful of people openly 
ventured to oppose the violation of human rights by the 
communist authorities. Even in June 1989, I managed to collect 
only 56-60 signatures for a statement in defense of the 
Bulgarian Turks. Two months later, about 100 people signed a 
second declaration that criticized the atmosphere of chauvinism 
in even stronger terms. 
  Most people joined the SDS in early 1990, at the time of the 
roundtable talks, when they realized with amazement that 
communism would never return. It was then that the great 
anticommunists appeared. Like you, even I had become a 
"communist" or, at the very least, a "defender of communism." 
  [Michnik] Why does no political center exist in Bulgaria? 
  [Zhelev] It is true that the bipolar BSP-SDS model is 
managing to survive. The reforms have been greatly delayed in 
Bulgaria. The communism-anticommunism confrontation continues 
to operate. The situation would be different if the land had 
been returned, if privatization had advanced further. As long 
as the main economic reforms are hardly beginning, the geometry 
of the political space is distorted. This is not Euclidean 
geometry, where right is right and left is left, and the center 
is in the middle. This only exists in the stable democracies. 
  [Michnik] In your view, Mr. President, what is a stable 
scenario for Bulgaria? 
  [Zhelev] The unification of the democratic forces in the 
name of the reforms, the return of the land to its owners, the 
advance of privatization -- these can guarantee the 
irreversibility of the transition. For this one needs a strong 
government with enough energy and willpower to act. 
  [Michnik] Do you not think that one has to cross the horizon 
of the future and build a reformist camp, not worrying whether 
its members were once communists or anticommunists? 
  [Zhelev] When we founded the SDS, I said that it should 
strive to form a coalition that unites people with democratic 
views. In my view, this is the only possible and reasonable 
formula for action -- continuously to expand the circle of those 
who support the reform. The tragedy of the SDS is that at the 
last elections it won 34 percent of the vote, but instead of 
expanding the circle of its supporters, relied on the so-called 
hardline electorate and even started -- as a result of internal 
conflicts -- to "shed" members. 
  [Michnik] Since we are speaking about intolerance.... 
  [Zhelev] All its forms are dangerous: national chauvinism, 
ideological fanaticism, religious fanaticism.... 
  [Michnik] Today a great wave of Islamic fundamentalism is 
washing through the world. Could it appear in your country as 
well? How are Bulgarian-Turkish relations? 
  [Zhelev] May God preserve us from both Islamic and Christian 
fundamentalism! Bulgaria is now threatened with a different 
form of fundamentalism -- political. As far as Turkey is 
concerned, I regard it not as a bridge, but rather as a barrier 
that separates us from the religious fundamentalism of the Arab 
countries, and especially Iran. 
  [Michnik] What about relations with the Bulgarian Turks? 
  [Zhelev] First, I should remind you that after 1989 the 
Bulgarian Turks received back the rights of which they were 
deprived by the communist authorities, which in 1984-85 almost 
brought our country face to face with a "Bosnian" alternative, 
long before the collapse of [East] Germany. I consider that no 
fundamentalism exists in this part of our population at present. 
The danger comes when people or groups try to exploit religion 
for political purposes. Such attempts are made from time to 
time, but they have no lasting effects. 
  [Michnik] What is the political scenario as regards the 
Bulgarian Turks? What do they want? 
  [Zhelev] They have great material problems. They are mainly 
farmers, but have never owned their land. Now, when the land is 
being reprivatized, it is mainly returning into the hands of the 
Bulgarians, which is arousing tensions. However, the law 
provides for all those who cultivate the land to receive 
ownership titles, but they come second in line. 
  [Michnik] Some Bulgarians claim Zhelev is blind, because 
he cannot see the danger. For example, he cannot see that there 
are regions in Bulgaria where no one speaks Bulgarian. 
  [Zhelev] These are nationalist provocations. Everywhere, 
our nationalists are like a horse with blinkers. Because of 
their limited views, because of their fanaticism, they are very 
dangerous. They manage to raise slogans like "Bulgaria above 
everything!" However, when I ask them what they have done for 
Bulgaria, for its prestige in Europe, and for democracy, they 
have nothing to say. 
  [Michnik] Is it true that in Bulgaria, like Germany, there 
exists a kind of solidarity with Milosevic and Serbia, based on 
Orthodoxy? 
  [Zhelev] Such a tendency does exist within part of the BSP; 
pan-Slavist groups also exist, but they do not have much 
influence. They were the ones who tried to exploit 
Zhirinovskiy's visit to Bulgaria. 
  [Michnik] Where did Milosevic and Tudjman come from? 
  [Zhelev] Both of them came from the League of Communists of 
Yugoslavia, but I do not think it matters where they came from, 
as it is more important to know what they are committing 
themselves to now. For example, Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov, who at 
one time was president of the Yugoslav Assembly, is now 
following a very sensible policy. Milan Kucan is doing the same 
in Slovenia. 
  [Michnik] What lies behind Milosevic's actions? 
  [Zhelev] One cannot talk about him without remembering the 
situation of Serbia and the Serbs following the collapse of the 
SFRY, nor can we ignore certain special features of the Serbian 
people. The neocommunists are playing the chief role in fanning 
nationalist attitudes.... 
  [Michnik] The neocommunists form a big faction in 
Milosevic's party. 
  [Zhelev] We are talking about the postcommunist period. 
Some think that this merely means the period following 
communism. It is like a mutated gene, and these mutations can 
be very dangerous. 
  [Michnik] Let us talk about Macedonia. 
  [Zhelev] Bulgaria was the first country in the world to 
recognize the statehood of this former Yugoslav republic. 
  [Michnik] This was a strange act. It is the first time I 
have heard of recognizing a country without recognizing the 
existence of its people. Both Greece and Serbia find the 
statehood of Macedonia and its name a major obstacle. Bulgaria 
has always considered that the Macedonians are its close 
relatives, and does so now. 
  [Zhelev] There is nothing strange in this. A state is 
always recognized. Under international law the recognition of a 
state means that a nation exists in that state that itself 
determines its own sovereignty and identity. It also implies 
that the country that recognizes this state has no territorial 
claims against it. However, international law says nothing about 
a special declaration that recognizes the existence -- or not -- 
of any nation. The nation either exists or it does not. Does 
the existence of the Poles as a nation have to be recognized? 
  [Michnik] I think Bulgaria is the only country in the 
Balkans in which the virus of hatred has failed to spread. What 
will the situation be in the future? 
  [Zhelev] The Bulgarian people are very tolerant.... 
  [Michnik] Have you ever heard a nation that describes itself 
as intolerant? 
  [Zhelev] This is proven by the facts; for example, by the 
fate of the Bulgarian Jews during World War II. 
  [Michnik] Anti-Semitism has never existed in Serbia either. 
It existed in Croatia, but not in Serbia.... However, today, 
how can the war end if the Serbs do not want to end it until a 
united Serbian state appears? 
  [Zhelev] I consider that a confederal model is the best one. 
The idea of a confederation is acceptable in Bosnia -- at least 
in the beginning. The Serbs will have great economic problems 
after this war. The legacy of the sanctions is even now 
arousing public discontent in Serbia. I believe in the victory 
of the forces of democracy, but the introduction of an overt 
military dictatorship is also possible. 
  It is essential to improve the relations between the Balkan 
peoples. This is very important. I mean we should develop an 
extended network of information links and transportation and 
other communications. In the Balkans the situation has always 
been poor in this respect. The peoples are distanced from one 
another not only by the mountains.

<F P=106> [Interview with Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and </F>
finance minister, by Katarzyna Jedrzejewska and Piotr 
Aleksandrowicz: "A Strategy for Poland;" date and place not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [RZECZPOSPOLITA] How high will inflation be 
for the next four years? 
  [Kolodko] I am determined to shape the macroeconomic 
proportions in such a way as to reach the level of single-digit 
inflation in 1997. Thus, if in 1997 the yearly inflation 
indicator were 9.6 percent, at the end of the same year 
inflation would be even lower. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Is the starting point of your forecasts the 
same as in this year's budget? 
  [Kolodko] It is practically the same. This year's budget 
envisioned a 23.1-percent price increase from December 1993 to 
December 1994; at the moment we are estimating this year's 
inflation to be 23.6 percent. As far as the path of lowering 
inflation is concerned: in 1995 the indicator would amount to 
approximately 16 percent, in 1996 -- in the vicinity of 12 
percent, and in 1997 -- less than 10 percent. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Will official prices rise at the same rate 
as inflation? Will official prices still exist? 
  [Kolodko] We would like to decrease the scope of official 
prices. As far as the rate of their increase is concerned, a 
certain concession has already been made for those who want it 
limited. This year we will be implementing the budget law 
rather strictly. In the years to come, the energy prices will 
be going up slightly more quickly than the overall inflation 
rate; however, the process will be slower than was agreed with 
the World Bank. 
  At this point I must make a more general remark. Reducing 
inflation is not the final goal of the economic policy. In our 
strategy lowering the inflation is an instrument necessary to 
persuade people to save money. Thus, it is an instrument that 
helps achieve investment growth as well as an increase in 
productivity. Only in such a sequence -- as an effect -- can we 
bring up the issue of real wage increases. 
  Another reason that lowering inflation is necessary is that 
the budget must be made less tight as far as its expenditures 
are concerned: the increase in expenditures must be controlled 
and then the costs of paying off the public debt must be 
reduced. Finally, the lowering of inflation means a slower 
devaluation rate, as a result of which the budget expenditures 
for paying off the foreign debt will be increasingly lower. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Right now the share of the public finances 
in the Gross Domestic Product [GDP] is approximately 50 percent. 
This indicator shows the degree of the redistribution. Is it 
satisfactory, or should it be greater or rather smaller? 
  [Kolodko] It should be smaller and we are defining how it 
should be lowered in the medium-term financial strategy. There 
are fewer difficulties as far as receipts are concerned; there 
are more difficulties concerning the expenditures. They are too 
great, both if we look at the level of our development and from 
the point of view of the market allocation of money, the 
so-called transfers for the people. This is related to the 
sphere of social benefits, which, even though small for 
individuals, overwhelms the public finances with its burden. 
  At any rate, I believe that the budget is fulfilling the 
function of redistribution to a degree that is too great; 
therefore, in the "Strategy for Poland," we would like to limit 
the redistribution by lowering the expenditures for the 
transfers for the people, and by protecting the real level of 
average wages and social benefits. This is possible. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] With what, then, would you now start the 
reforms? 
  [Kolodko] I would start them first of all by blocking the 
process of the employees of various industry branches' gaining 
further privileges, such as an earlier pension age, which we 
have been witnessing for years, including very recently. 
  The problem is not that our benefits are too high; the real 
problem is the fact that there are too many beneficiaries in 
Poland. I am aware of the fact that the people will become the 
beneficiaries of the reform of the system of social reforms and 
insurances only after a longer period of time. However, if we 
want to think about the public finances and plan certain things 
a long time ahead, we must implement changes now. Our 
government is prepared to take up this difficult challenge. 
  For me this planning means that in 2005, Poland must be in a 
position to meet the Maastricht criterion which says that the 
public debt should amount to approximately 60 percent of the GDP 
at the most. There are no politicians among us who would think 
along these lines. However, one must think this way. Today I 
have made decisions, concerning the reduction of our foreign 
debt, up to the year 2004. In the meantime, however, I often 
have to make decisions "for yesterday." 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Let us return to this year's budget. Is 
the deficit going to be such as was included in this law, that 
is, lower? 
  [Kolodko] I hope that it will be a little lower. We would 
like to lower the size of the deficit from more than 6 percent 
of the GDP in 1992 to less than 4 percent this year, and not 
more than 2 percent in 1997. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] How? 
  [Kolodko] Greater pressure is being placed on increasing 
revenues; however, this should not be achieved through further 
hardening of the state's fiscal policy, which is being -- 
probably unfairly -- criticized. It should rather be attained 
through the completion of the construction of the taxation 
system. Some issues are going to take as many as several years, 
such as the cadastre and the new tax on immovable property. We 
are considering gradual, quiet changes in the area of taxes on 
capital-derived revenues; however, I do not think that this is 
an issue of paramount importance. We are seriously treating the 
slogan of absorbing the gray market and collecting overdue 
taxes. [passage omitted] 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Do you intend to exclude the National Bank 
of Poland [NBP] from the financing of the budget deficit? 
  [Kolodko] NBP is my ally and my cooperation with Ms. Hanna 
Gronkiewicz-Waltz is developing very well. The central bank 
should try to minimize its share in the financing of the deficit 
in the end; it should concentrate on the function of issuing and 
be a modern central bank. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Do you think that the money supply should 
be the same as the nominal GDP growth, slightly faster, or 
slower? In other words, should the financial policy be stricter 
or more expansive? 
  [Kolodko] I believe that the amount of money will be 
increasing slightly faster than the nominal GDP. 
  First of all, I would like the central bank to see to it 
that 
the really positive interest rates are maintained. I expect it 
to aim at lowering the cost of money and the discrepancy between 
the interest rates of bank deposits and the interest rates of 
credits. We have already made a serious step in this direction: 
we have agreed that the reserves for bad credits be included by 
banks in the costs of their activities, which decreases their 
tax burdens. As a consequence, the cost of money decreases. 
The activities of the central bank should not be guided by the 
temporary needs of the government or of the finance minister: it 
should be guided by the desire to perform the task of 
stabilizing the money in the long run. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] You said that the money supply should 
increase faster than the GDP. What if the bank has a different 
opinion on that? 
  [Kolodko] We should say this differently. The central bank 
should shape the money supply in such a way as to proceed down 
the roughly-defined path of limiting the inflation. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] If it accepts it. 
  [Kolodko] I think that it accepts it... Second, the level 
of the supply must be influenced by the problem of net 
international reserves. This issue has not been settled. I 
believe that the reserves should be maintained on more or less 
the present level. An alternative to this is an increase. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] In this way we have reached the issue of 
the currency exchange rate. You said that you would readily 
lower the rate of the creeping devaluation. In what way? Very 
slowly, or faster, but perhaps with a leap devaluation, just as 
it occurred last year? 
  [Kolodko] The scale of devaluation is a function of the 
processes related to inflation, especially a function of the 
increase in the prices of industrial products. On the other 
hand, the scale of devaluation influences inflation through the 
prices of imported goods, and especially through the 
expectations concerning inflation. We want to carry out our 
policy of a "creeping" devaluation in such a way as to prevent a 
real appreciation of the zloty. The basket of currencies should 
go up at more or less the same rate as the index of production 
prices. I will not tell you how to do this because the finance 
minister must not discuss certain matters. One can imagine a 
process of decreasing the scale slowly, the so-called crawling 
peg [preceding two words in English], or a process of decreasing 
it more rapidly, along with a small corrective devaluation, by 
three points for instance. I am saying this rather generally 
because it should not be expected for the time being. 
  In the end -- I do not know whether this will be in 1997, a 
year earlier, or a year later -- we would like to switch to a 
floating rate which will be determined among banks. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What will become of the 6-percent import 
tax which should be lifted this year? 
  [Kolodko] We will try to decrease it -- after arrangements 
with our foreign and international partners -- by 1 percentage 
point a year. Thus, it will disappear after some time. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What about the compensatory fees? Does the 
lack of an executive order, necessary for their implementation, 
result from the fact that you are against the fees? 
  [Kolodko] I believe that the scope of the compensatory fees 
should be limited. They should be applied in situations when 
there are clear characteristics of a dumping policy. They 
should also go for products which are of fundamental importance 
for the level of employment and for the level of revenues in the 
Polish agriculture. Indeed, the final decisions have not yet 
been made. However, the list of the products will be shorter 
than might have been suggested in some press reports. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What is the greatest inflation increase, 
caused by the compensatory fees, that you consider acceptable? 
  [Kolodko] I would not like to add more than half of 1 
percentage point. Incidentally, the results of the introduction 
of the compensatory fees have not been included in the 
above-mentioned inflation estimate -- 23.6 percent. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Let us now discuss privatization. Is the 
government going to present a uniform stand on the issue of 
privatization within the next few months? 
  [Kolodko] You cannot see such a stand, then? 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] No, we cannot. 
  [Kolodko] If you cannot see it, then it will become clearer 
because there are people who have clear views on this. I would 
prefer concrete questions. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What about the privatization of banks? Is 
the Industrial-Commercial Bank going to be privatized? Is a 
fourth bank going to be selected for privatization this year? 
  [Kolodko] The first question, which we will answer as early 
as June, is the following: Should this sector first be 
consolidated, or privatized? Perhaps, then, the 
Industrial-Commercial Bank will be privatized in a different 
configuration, as a result of a consolidation process. 
Increasingly more experts are saying that banks should first be 
consolidated. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What about the privatization and the future 
of the State Insurance Bureau [PZU]? 
  [Kolodko] We want to restructure the insurance sector in 
such a way as to first of all weaken the monopolist position of 
PZU. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] A division, then? 
  [Kolodko] I would like to answer this question in two weeks' 
time; however, I do not rule out the possibility that PZU will 
be divided. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What is your evaluation of the program of 
commercialization of state-owned enterprises? 
  [Kolodko] My views are similar to the views of Minister 
Kaczmarek; I share his opinion that over 1,000 enterprises, 
especially the bigger ones, should be quickly commercialized, so 
that we will be able to lift the popiwek [tax on excessive wage 
increases] at the end of this year. 
  We also want to establish the criteria for selecting the 
enterprises that should be quickly privatized. On the other 
hand, the parliament should define the areas of the economy 
which will not be privatized in the foreseeable future. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] The program of National Investment Funds 
will be continued, of course, will it not? 
  [Kolodko] Yes, it will. One must run forward; this program 
must be completed and looked upon as broadly as possible, even 
though it does not entirely resolve either the problems of 
ownership transformations, or the problem of running this 
property. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What portion of the GDP and what portion of 
the industrial production will come from the private sector in 
1997, do you think? 
  [Kolodko] I do not know these figures and I am not 
particularly excited by any forecasts in this area. However, 
the private sector will certainly be developing faster than the 
state- owned sector and the indicators of its share in 
employment, production, and exports will be rising, due to the 
faster growth rate of private companies, the influx of foreign 
capital, and the denationalization processes. However, these 
indicators will be changing in favor of the private sector less 
rapidly than they have been changing in recent years, because a 
revolution is carried out only once. You cannot double 
something that already has over a 50- percent share in the 
global indexes. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What do you think of the participation of 
employees in privatization? 
  [Kolodko] My views on this are rather moderate. Not only 
does it not guarantee greater efficiency, but it also decreases 
budgetary receipts; moreover, it is unfair. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Why is it unfair? 
  [Kolodko] Because they put pressure on it and its 
beneficiaries are only defined groups of employees of mostly 
medium- sized enterprises. As a result, budget sphere 
employees, senior citizens, inhabitants of rural areas, and 
employees of enterprises which will still be owned by the state 
for a long time, including many large enterprises, are left out 
of the privatization process. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] One of the restructurization and 
privatization ideas would be the exchange of the Polish debt for 
shares in Polish enterprises. Are any details known yet and 
does the government unanimously approve of this idea? 
  [Kolodko] The answer is negative to both questions. 
Generally, the thought is the following: the government's task, 
resulting from the reasons of the state, is to also dispose of 
some of the public debt while disposing of such a vast amount of 
assets. Hence the support for the settlement procedure or, in 
the future, the issuing of special public debt Treasury bonds 
which may be exchanged for elements of the privatized property. 
Some time in the future we would like to start buying out the 
public debt and offer the privatized property, especially to 
households. This will enrich our capital market. The second 
aspect is of an international nature. If we successfully 
finalize the reduction that has already been included in the 
general agreement with the London Club -- and this process is 
slowly but surely going on -- then I think that we should take 
the second step and implement a bold program of exchanging part 
of the remaining debt for shares in enterprises. I would like 
for such transactions to be closely related with the inflow of 
foreign capital from private sources; I would like them to be an 
element of the packet which also includes cash investment and 
(or) certain investment commitments for the future. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Investment or social commitments? 
  [Kolodko] I would prefer the former. It will create new 
work places. 
  We want to kill three birds with one stone... I guess that 
this is too much: decreasing the debt, privatization, and inflow 
of direct investment enhancing the competitiveness of the Polish 
economy. In this way these investments are supposed to be 
advantageous to the Polish people, even though, of course, the 
foreign capital will make its own business. I cannot see any 
discrepancy here. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] If the program is to yield considerable 
profits, it must concern large and attractive companies -- 
refineries, telecommunications, insurance, perhaps airlines... 
  [Kolodko] That is right. In Argentina 20 percent of the 
debt -- $10 billion -- was liquidated in this way. I can see no 
reason why we should not try this in Poland. Also here we must 
run forward and resist this pseudo-capitalist bla bla bla that 
we will sell Poland out and give it away for half the price. 
This is just not true. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Your projects seem to be rather 
technocratic... 
  [Kolodko] They are pragmatic... 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] In the meantime, in one of your interviews 
you said that you would like the GDP to be distributed more 
justly. What does one have to do with the other and how do you 
intend to achieve this justice? 
  [Kolodko] The process of transformation is related to 
colossal redistribution and we touch upon this problem in almost 
every question. This redistribution is done through the budget 
or through the capital market, or it is transferred over 
borders. The beneficiaries of this process are various social 
groups and it will continue to be this way. Now, there is the 
question: How to distribute the results of the increase in 
productivity, the results of the growing GDP? We want to change 
the relations of work and remuneration. I am determined to 
depart from the chaotic, political, sick bidding system, which 
is anti market. 
  I am certainly not a populist, I will not allow anyone to 
put 
such a label on me. However, I believe that right now there is 
time for more social sensitivity. And I believe that it is in 
the interest of the people if we change the relations of work 
and the principles of remuneration. We cannot have a situation 
in which bilateral negotiations are always conducted, even if 
the problems are multidimensional. I am against transferring 
all the decisions concerning wages to the central level. I am 
in favor of deregulation and decentralization; I am also against 
the idea of imposing the concept of a corporate state. 
  We will have the Trilateral Commission; it will be written 
down in the law. However, it is supposed to be first of all a 
place where the conflicting interests will be discussed; it will 
be the forum of negotiations. It will certainly not decide 
everything. The government is subordinated to the parliament and 
to the president; it will certainly not be subordinated to the 
Trilateral Commission. 
  Now, returning to your question, when we speak about social 
justice, we do not say that we want to be good uncles and we 
want to give away some of the budget money. On the contrary. 
There is justice when the stronger are not allowed to take 
money away from the weaker -- through strike pressure, for 
instance. More just distribution is when it is those who work 
hard that earn more money than those who strike hard, not vice 
versa.

  [Excerpt] After a meeting this morning of the Croatian 
Democratic Union [HDZ] deputies club, chaired by President 
Franjo Tudjman, and a meeting of opposition leaders, a session 
of the Parliament's House of Counties began in the early hours 
of the afternoon. It was adjourned around 1800. The 
parliamentary crisis does not seem to have been overcome despite 
an agreement among the parliamentary parties on the distribution 
of the key positions in the parliament. 
  [Correspondent] Josip Manolic was relieved of duty in a 
relatively swift and painless manner and the HDZ's Katica 
Ivanisevic was elected to take over his position. However, the 
crisis was reopened during the voting by 68 deputies present at 
the session, when Josip Manolic got 33 out of the 35 votes 
needed to be elected third deputy speaker in the chamber of 
counties. Such an outcome of the vote demonstrates a failure by 
the HDZ to respect the interparty agreement, according to the 
opposition. It leads to a parliamentary crisis, Mestrovic said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 24 May (TANJUG) -- A delegation of the 
republic of Srpska -- made up of Momcilo Krajisnik, president of 
the republic of Srpska people's assembly, and foreign minister 
Aleksa Buha -- left for Geneva today where a meeting between the 
contact group and the cochairmen of the conference on the former 
Yugoslavia, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, is being held. 
  The republic of Srpska's press office has announced that the 
delegation is to present to representatives of the international 
community and cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg the Serb side's 
stance on the possible resumption of the peace talks, stressing 
the establishment of a lasting cease-fire in all parts of that 
former Yugoslav republic and the equal treatment of all sides in 
the conflict. This is in line with the conclusions of the 
republic of Srpska assembly adopted at a recent session in Brcko. 
  The Serbian side will warn of the Muslim offensive that has 
been going on with unabated intensity, and will insist that the 
unfair and inadequate behavior of the Muslim side hampers any 
resumption of talks, a statement says. The republic of Srpska's 
delegation is expected to take part in consultative meetings 
with important personalities from the international community 
who are interested in the speedy creation of conditions 
necessary for the resumption of talks. 
  Immediately before departure, Krajisnik said that there were 
considerable problems in creating conditions for the resumption 
of talks. The statement stresses that the contact group for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has ignored the solving of these problems, 
underestimating their importance.

    [Editorial Report] On 22 January the Macedonian-language 
Skopje daily NOVA MAKEDONIJA begins an 18-part survey of the 
most important political parties in The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia (FYROM) called, ``Four Years Since the Formation of 
Political Parties in Macedonia.'' 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The series begins on page 3 with a 300-word unattributed 
introduction. 
  ``Four years of a pluralistic political environment in 
Macedonia has provided the opportunity for some 60 parties to 
establish themselves. If such a number did not guarantee any 
particular quality in carrying out a struggle for power, it did 
testify unequivocably to the striving of the society for 
democratic change. Nine months before the second scheduled 
democratic elections are to be held, one can safely say that the 
political realm reflects the great number of events which have 
set the stage for these parties and account for their influence. 
From the parliamentary elections in November 1990, when about 20 
political entities appeared in an organized way to contest in 
the first free democratic elections, through the establishing of 
the first multiparty republic-level assembly (in January 1991) 
and the formation of the new government of Nikola Kljusev (in 
March 1991), through the erasing of the designation `socialist' 
from the name of the state and the affirmation of the referendum 
for a sovereign and independent state (September 1991), to the 
confirmation of the Constitution (November 1991), the number of 
parties has increased continually. Those already on the 
political scene fought for greater scope and for more adherents. 
The process continued after the adoption of the Declaration on 
International Recognition (December 1991), after the departure 
of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] from our country's territory 
(March 1992), after the admission to the United Nations in April 
1993, and it appears that they will not lose their intensity 
from now until the November elections. However, the well-known 
characteristics of our political scene leave five or six 
parties in the forefront of the strivings of the citizens for 
more rapid democratization and a more successful economic and 
spiritual life in the Republic of Macedonia. In a few essays, we 
will presentanalyses of the development of these parties in the 
past few years, their positions on various topics, and the 
extent to which their initial program goals have remained 
consistent over time.'' 
<H5>  VMRO-DPMNE </H5>
  In the first of a two-part (second part unavailable) 
1400-word essay by Lilica Kitanovska in the 22 January issue on 
page 3, entitled ``Uncompromising Attitude As a Boomerang,'' the 
VMRO-DPMNE (Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity) is 
examined. 
  ``The VMRO-DPMNE is, without a doubt, the party that 
exemplifies the beginning of our new political era. From its own 
declaration, characterizing itself as `a national party with 
comprehensive liberating national-patriotic and democratic 
aspirations, pledges, and preoccupations,' this party introduced 
and has continued to emphasize an insistence on polarity in the 
Macedonian political environment.'' 
  From the time of its founding, 17 June 1990, until today, 
the party has never accepted being counted as a ``rightwing 
party,'' but it has fought primarily against the parties in 
the leftwing block. In the first multiparty elections, the 
VMRO-DPMNE gained 38 seats in the Assembly. This party, which 
acquired the sobriquet--``most Macedonian''--has as its 
overwhelming purpose: ``the struggle for the restoration of the 
pride and worthiness of the Macedonian individual, the 
Macedonian people, and the Macedonian state.'' ``Its program 
includes a plea for a confederation status in the Macedonian 
state as the only guarantee for a comprehensive Macedonian 
sovereignty and as a basic precondition for negotiations with 
neighboring countries for the unification of Macedonia.... And 
what does the VMRO-DPMNE mean by unification? According to its 
program, `unification entails the complete spiritual, political, 
economic, and ethnic unification of the scattered Macedonian 
people and a state in a future united Balkan peninsula.''' There 
is some ambiguity over whether the VMRO-DPMNE fully recognizes 
the existing state borders. 
  The VMRO-DPMNE's attitude toward the non-Macedonian ethnic 
groups is not based on a developed philosophy. In its election 
platform, the party called for `a future Macedonian state in 
which all national minorities and ethnic groups would be 
guaranteed the civil rights prescribed by international 
conventions.' ``The VMRO-DPMNE suggested numerous amendments to 
the Constitution that conflicted with the preamble by suggesting 
a definition of the republic as a state of the Macedonian 
people, leaving out the enumeration of the minorities and the 
term nationalities and replacing it with the term national 
minorities. While most of these changes were not passed by the 
constitutional commission, Article 7, dealing with the official 
language, was an exception.'' The VMRO-DPMNE may have indirectly 
supported a spontaneous demonstration against the adoption of 
the Constitution and is suspected of not wanting the 
Constitution. 
  Ljupco Georgievski, the leader of the party, served briefly 
as Macedonia's vice president, but his resignation made it 
easier for him to assert the party's ideological goals. The 
party has not been able to compromise or participate in 
government effectively. 
<H5>  SDSM </H5>
  The SDSM, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia -- the 
party's current name -- is the subject of a two-part essay by 
Aleksandar Damovski. The first is a 900-word article appearing 
in NOVA MAKEDONIJA on 24 January on page 3, headlined 
``Promotion of Social Democracy.'' The second appears in the 25 
January edition on page 3, 1,200 words, and is entitled ``The 
Burden of Suitable and Unsuitable Hypotheses.'' 
  Responding to the general changes in political and economic 
systems, the League of Communists of Macedonia, which renamed 
itself the League of Communists--Party for Democratic 
Transformation, participated in the multiparty elections in 
November-December 1990, winning 220,759 votes, or 20.38 percent, 
and 31 seats (the current number is 28), in second place behind 
the VMRO-DPMNE. The party emphasized a civic concept of society 
and a slightly different approach to the minority question and 
human rights. The party also advocated a role for Macedonia as a 
confederative state within the community of Yugoslav peoples; 
equality of all citizens before the law; parliamentary democracy 
and a multiparty political life; the formation of bodies at the 
republic-level to oversee the process of reprivatization; secure 
prospects for private initiative; and adequate representation of 
the workers in the management bodies of the enterprises. 
  The party's influence and representation in the governments 
(half of the ministers, a prime minister, and the head of state) 
is disproportionate to its electoral success. This can be seen 
as a double-edged sword because it has also involved the party 
in great scandals, classical blackmarketing, classical 
racketeering, conflicts of interest, and dubious import-export 
deals. 
  ``In the SDSM program, it was written that `an absolute 
priority will be given to privatization in the establishment of 
the new structure of ownership. The private structure is 
indispensible and should be present in all spheres of life.''' 
The party's secretary at the time of the second conference, 
Nikola Popovski (who is now the party's vice chairman) pointed 
out the dilemna involved in this policy since it conflicted with 
the party's traditional social goals; restituting land to former 
owners would leave many landless. 
  ``In his speech at the meeting of the SDSM's central 
committee in December 1993, Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski 
claimed credit for Macedonia's achievements, especially 
international recognition. The country's progress was due to the 
party: `If we speak of foreign policy, it is the foreign policy 
of President Kiro Gligorov; if we speak of the Constitution, it 
is the Constitution of Frckovski, Popovski, and Kitanovski; if 
we speak of privatization, it is the privatization of Jane 
Miljovski.''' 
  The SDSM evolved from a party trying to successively to 
preserve ties with Federal Yugoslavia, then a Yugoslav 
confederation, and finally an independent state. As far as the 
ethnic question is concerned, the party remains committed to the 
civic orientation exemplified in the Constitution. ``According 
to Branko Crvenkovski: `We know that the people want the 
Constitution to say that it is a state of the Macedonian nation, 
that they had another state, that they had a mother state....We 
know that that earns points and that it is the easiest way to 
reach voters, but we are consciously taking another path.''' 
<H5>  PDP </H5>
  The Party for Democratic Prosperity, the PDP, is the subject 
of a two-part essay by Panta Djambazoski. ``Formation in an 
Overly Sensitive Period,'' is the title of a 1,200-word essay 
appearing on 26 January, on page 3; ``The Governing Coalition 
Alters the Activity,'' appearing in the 27 January issue on page 
3, running 1,200 words, is the title of the second essay. 
  ``The Party for Democratic Prosperity, headquartered in 
Tetovo, is the largest party of Albanians in our country. It was 
registered on 25 May 1990 and, like the Social Democratic Party 
of Macedonia, is a party with the longest official existence in 
the Republic of Macedonia after the breaking of the political 
party monopoly of the League of Communists. In fact, the party 
began to form itself much earlier with the gathering of the 
people who would lead political activity, and with the founding 
meeting of the PDP, which was convened on 14 April 1990 when the 
Law on Political Parties and Associations was passed. On the 
same day, in the village of Djepiste, the Assembly of the party 
was held. Nevzat Halili was elected chairman, and Mithat Emini 
secretary.'' 
  ``The PDP is a civic party according to its program. The 
main 
party body is staffed with Albanians, but one of the founders of 
the party was the well-known Skopje lawyer, Dusko Apostolski. 
According to Chairman Halili, the purpose of the PDP was `for a 
political party to confidently assert for the first time the 
colletive demands of Albanians, Muslims, Turks, and others for 
true equality and democracy.' However, as time passed and as new 
ethnic parties (of Turks, Muslims, Romanies, and others), the 
PDP has become a single ethnic party in its practice, 
activities, and membership and leaders.'' 
  The essay continues that at the time of the PDP's founding, 
there was a sense of euphoria among the Albanians as they 
participated in mass meetings. There was also a sharp division 
between those who were for it and those opposed to it. The PDP 
was also perceived as having as its only goal, a greater 
Albania, and its activism coincided with that of the 
nationalistic parties among Macedonians. ``At the PDP's first 
congress in February 1992, Chairman N. Halili said that `many 
extremist Macedonian political parties welcomed the founding of 
the PDP with accusations and denigration in the communist 
style....they were not for democracy ... but for the supremacy 
and hegemony of the Macedonian people.''' 
  The still unpublished PDP program calls for the complete 
political, economic, and ethnic rights and liberties of all 
people. ``The party recognizes the territorial integrity of 
Macedonia, viewing it as a state of all national collectives, of 
all citizens--Macedonians, Albanians, Turks, Muslims, Vlachs, 
Romanies, and others. The national collectives which have all 
the characteristics of a people [narod], such as history, 
territorial compactness, language, alphabet, culture, and 
tradition, should be thought of as a people and should have that 
`constitutional status.' The PDP favors a free market economy; 
privatization, including private education; improvement of 
agriculture; emancipation of women; and the freedom of citizens 
to have a religion. The PDP advocates equality of languages and 
alphabets of the ethnic groups in all state bodies and 
institutions, and free instruction in the mother tongues. The 
PDP favors the complete integration of Albanians in Europe and 
demands the protection of the appropriate European 
institutions.'' 
  ``In the first multiparty elections, the party won 22 seats; 
on average, for each seat, the party won 7,900 votes, and a 
total of 263,800 votes for all candidates. In the parliament, 
the PDP parliamentary group entered a coalition along with a 
single representative of the other Albanian party, the People's 
Democratic Party [Narodna Demokratska Partija, NPD]. 
Representative Djeladin Murati became one of the vice chairmen 
of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. During the 
interparty parliamentary negotiations, the PDP was dissatisfied 
because it got one vice chairmanship in the parliament and one 
ministry in the government, although it had demanded that at 
least one of the three primary positions in the three highest 
state bodies be given to the PDP, as well as at least three out 
of six deputy ministerial positions.'' After a year and a half, 
Branko Crvenkovski formed a party government, including the PDP 
as a coalition partner. The PDP received a deputy prime 
ministerial position in the government, five ministerial 
positions, and more deputy and assistant ministerial positions. 
``But there remains considerable discontent among the leaders of 
the party because of the still unfulfilled program goals. This 
is perhaps one of the reasons for the recent party split.'' 
  ``The PDP began to build its political image with an 
expression of a certain degree of distrust and phobia toward the 
state and its institutions.'' That led the party to boycott the 
1991 census, which now necessitates a new census. The boycott 
could be considered a big mistake by the PDP because a 
substantial portion of the population saw it as disloyalty to 
the state, even while the PDP began to participate in 
government.'' 
  Another decisive event was the referendum for political and 
territorial autonomy of Albanians in Macedonia. ``In a formal 
sense, the PDP did not organize the referendum, but it did not 
oppose it. On the contrary, it explained that it would respect 
the will expressed by the people and would undertake a 
commitment to achieve autonomy. This position was espoused also 
at the PDP's congress. Afterwards came explanations to the 
effect that this prescription was not meant to be frightening; 
that it would be applicable only to th equal use of language and 
alphabet by Albanians wherever they might live in Macedonia. At 
the same time, there was an opposing view that this autonomy 
should be established literally and in classic institutions. It 
was also explained that, to the extent that the question of 
Albanians was not resolved, they would seek to constitute 
autonomy within the borders of Macedonia. Such an explanation 
was even given by the head of the parliamentary group, Muhamed 
Halili. In an interview with our newspaper, Secretary Mithat 
Emini explained that eventually autonomy would be achieved 
through the institutions of the Macedonian state. But for a 
member of the presidency, Mahi Nesimi, autonomy would be a 
`strange condition' in which some Albanians would enjoy autonomy 
and others would remain outside it.'' It is precisely this issue 
that divides the leadership structures and has contributed to 
the current split. 
  ``The PDP representatives did not vote for the adoption of 
the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia; this is another 
argument of those who wish to see the party banned. But in any 
case, the democratic public was also irritated because this was 
the first constitution of an independent and sovereign 
Macedonia. That position taken by the parliamentary group was 
explained by Secretary Emini: `The Albanians, believing that 
Macedonia was also their country, expected and endeavored to 
make the Constitution reflect their natural and legitimate right 
to be equal as a people in their country and to be a 
state-forming people.''' There were other disturbing signs, such 
as ``N. Halili's recommendation at the 1992 Congress that 
Albania should not recognize Macedonia as long as Macedonia did 
not recognize Kosovo as a republic and the participation of M. 
Halili as a member of Albania's delegation at the 1993 CSCE 
meeting in Prague, at which the Albanians voted against the 
admission of Macedonia to the CSCE.'' 
  ``The demands of the PDP could be summarized as follows: 
changing the Constitution; equal admission of Albanians to 
middle schools and opening the Pedagogical Department to 
Albanians; at least 4-5 hours of Albanian-language programming 
on Macedonian television; representation of Albanians at all 
levels in the state bodies; and a population census carried out 
under international supervision.'' 
  The author concludes that the tension between the PDP's 
goals 
as a party in the coalition and its role as an ethnic movement 
remains serious. It has contributed to the split between the 
``hard'' faction, led by Menduh Thaqi, and the ``soft'' faction 
of the parliamentary representatives, ministers, and some 
members of the presidency. The PDP faces competition from the 
NPD and the Albanian Democratic Union - Liberal Party (ADS-LP). 
<H5>  Liberal Party </H5>
  A two-part essay by Zoran Petrov appears in the 28 and 29 
January editions of NOVA MAKEDONIJA, both on page 3. The first, 
1,400 words, is entitled ``At a Distance from Both Left and 
Right''; the second, 1,700 words, is headlined ``In a Continual 
Misunderstanding with the Center.'' 
  ``In many ways, one of the most specific and most 
characteristic party in the Macedonian pluralistic environment 
is the Liberal Party. The party built its own identity and image 
as a truly democratic, progressive force but has been unable to 
escape such accusations as `imported,' `faceless,' 
`bureaucratic-managerial,' `greedy for power,' and `a party that 
was the prolonger of a defeated opposition in an already 
unstable Yugoslavia.''' 
  ``On the other hand, the Liberals from their emergence until 
today have been in a latent but continual conflict with 
everything around them, constantly stressing that their 
proposals, ideas, and projects are being by-passed, that their 
contribution is being disregarded, or, in one word, they have 
been treated unfairly. The rivalry with its coalition partner 
the SDSM, which recently became more pronounced, represented a 
serious threat to the survival of the current government, but 
even the news media were not spared from accusations from the 
Liberals that they were under the influence of the SDSM. Thus, a 
seemingly contradictory situation developed within the Liberal 
Party itself. On the one hand, the `fat rewards' required them 
to participate in the executive branch, especially in the three 
significant governing bodies (dealing with foreign affairs, 
economics, and health), and, on the other, they were constantly 
in a dissatisfied and critical mood toward that same 
government.'' 
<H5>  ``In the Beginning Was Ante Markovic'' </H5>
  ``The Liberal Party was founded on 5 October 1990 with the 
name and symbols identical to the then Union of Reformist Forces 
of Yugoslavia (SRSJ), under the leadership of SFRY [Socialist 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Prime Minister Ante Markovic. At 
the time, it was obliged to distinguish itself from the SRSJ 
branches in Serbia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Montenegro, and 
Vojvodina, so the Macedonians registered themselves as an 
autocephalous party and avoided formally introducing themselves 
as a `daughter' from the center in Belgrade; they would not just 
exist as a Yugoslav political substitute. However, the influence 
that the then Yugoslav prime minister exerted through this party 
was unambiguous, not only as the father of the SRSM [Party of 
Reformist Forces of Macedonia] program and its clear economic 
orientation, but also without a doubt vis-a-vis the electoral 
body in Macedonia where Markovic visited several times during 
the election campaign. The indisputable fact is that the 
popularity of the leader of the Federal Executive Council led 
directly to the electoral success of the SRSM, resulting in the 
seating of 18 representatives from this party in the Assembly of 
the Republic of Macedonia. As is known, Markovic soon fell from 
power, and the SRSM was left alone to establish, defend, and 
propagate its political identity and image in new conditions. It 
is noteworthy that only in Macedonia, where the reformists had 
gained the greatest number of seats in the republic-level 
parliament, did the reformists survive, whereas in the other 
former Yugoslav republics, they suffered a complete fiasco. 
  ``It is interesting that in the first elections, this party 
performed favorably in Kavadarci, where it captured all three 
seats; in Negotino, it won one seat; in Kocani and in Stip, two 
out of three seats respectively; in Bitola, the party won three 
out of nine seats; one seat each in Prilep, Kumanovo, and 
Venica; and in Skopje, the SRSM won three out of 32 electoral 
districts. It should be remembered that the SRSM had entered an 
electoral coalition with the Young Democratic-Progressive Party, 
whose leader was Risto Ivanov, and with a certain Association of 
Artisans from Stip. The SRSM's definitive assimilation into a 
political party came at the first annual assembly in July 1991 
when the party renamed itself: Reformist Forces of Macedonia - 
Liberal Party (RSMLP). With respect to the electoral results, we 
can see another curious phenomenon. Namely, it is currently the 
only group in the Macedonian parliament whose number has 
grown--by one member (from its ranks only Djulistana Markovska 
left, while Blagoja Ckartovski and Dimitar Trpenovski joined 
them); in any case, this is an indicator of the internal 
stability and cohesion of the party. 
  ``Otherwise, the final defining of the party that introduced 
the completed phase of its maturation came at last year's 
regular assembly in June when the RSMLP decisively launched its 
new name: Liberal Party of Macedonia. This step was logically 
followed by the so-called New Between-Elections Program of the 
Liberal Party; this is the completed elaboration of the party's 
initial program.'' 
<H5>  ``Firmly for Strengthening the Economy'' </H5>
  ``An unambiguous accomplishment of the LP, which is in 
fourth 
place in terms of numbers in the Macedonian parliament, is its 
favorable position in the government. Besides the position of 
chairmanship of the Assembly, which is held by party leader 
Stojan Andov, the LP members of the government are: Stevo 
Crvenkovski, foreign minister; Gordana Siljanovska, minister 
without portfolio; Petrus Stefanov, minister of the economy; and 
Jovan Tofovski, minister of health. In addition, there are four 
deputy ministers from the LP in the ministries of internal 
affairs, development, science, and culture. Until his 
resignation a little over a month ago, Risto Ivanov held the 
position and functions of a deputy prime minister in the 
Government of the Republic of Macedonia. All of this showed that 
the party had a place and a strong need to actively participate 
in the government and to share in Macedonia's internal and 
external policies. It is characteristic of this party that, 
while it is perhaps an active initiator of new ideas and 
projects, this is the feature that leads to misunderstandings 
and disputes with its coalition partners.'' 
  The LP's program has become more precise over time, but its 
basic orientation toward a democratic process, civic rights, and 
economic development on the basis of private ownership and the 
market. ``The party has begun to delineate five overarching 
goals: 
  ``1. Realization of the Macedonian state's turn toward the 
establishment of free, equal, economic and political empowerment 
of citizens and individuals; 
  ``2. Restoration of the social system on the basis of the 
civic status of the individual; 
  ``3. Europeanization and global modernization of Macedonia's 
productive, economic, social, and cultural models and ways of 
life; 
  ``4. Establishment of a strong, highly productive, and 
efficient economy which, through private and collective 
enterprise and market mechanisms, will be included on an equal 
basis in the world market and in European integration; 
  ``5. Restoration of a single Macedonian cultural-ethnic 
sphere through the opening of borders and the democratization of 
relations in the Balkans, as well as the resolution of the 
question of national rights and status of the Macedonian people 
in neighboring countries, and the internationalization of this 
question.'' 
  The author says that the LP has attempted out of necessity 
to 
portray itself as a party of the center, keeping a ``hygienic 
distance'' from the nationalists and ultra-leftist parties. 
While the LP thinks that it represents the true interests of the 
Macedonian people, opinion polls show that the popularity of 
this party is falling steadily. Despite the LP's standing as a 
serious political exponent and generator of ideas, its 
representatives have been accused of ``flirting with the 
opposition'' in some discussions and some votes in the 
parliament. 
<H5>  ``Serious Conflict With the Ministry of Internal Affairs'' </H5>
  Two issues particularly concerned the LP after it entered a 
governing coalition with the SDSM, the PDP, and the SP, 
Socialist Party. One was to transform the Public Accounting 
Service. According to the author, the PDP regarded this 
quasi-government organization as an impediment to privatization. 
This position, however, led to difficulties within the coalition 
and public criticism that the LP was simply trying to protect 
its enterprises and directors. The second issue that led to poor 
relations among the coalition partners was connected with 
transforming the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVR), which the 
LP viewed as ``an institution, in form, staffing, and structure 
a legacy from the old concept of the `real socialist state.' 
Further, the police exert great influence in the shaping of 
political life and the `creation' of a polical atmosphere in the 
economy, in some political parties, and even in some news media 
establishments.'' The dispute between the LP and the MVR reached 
its culmination last September when the LP abstained from voting 
during the interpellation concerning the work of Internal 
Affairs Minister Frckovski. 
  The article continues, relations among the coalition members 
had come under strain even earlier. For example, in an interview 
with the Belgrade daily BORBA, Stojan Andov said, ```The 
democratic processes in Macedonia are at a standstill.''' He 
supported that position by noting that the systemic laws 
required by the Constitution were being postponed. ``Later, in a 
16 November interview with NOVA MAKEDONIJA, Andov said, `We 
think that the relationship with our party is inadmissably bad. 
Their pushing us to one side is a factor and our people have 
been suspicious of some basic measures. Such a strategy was 
developed by those circles in the SDSM that have been 
endeavoring to get rid of the Liberal Party. They believed that 
the Macedonian voters should be divided into those whose views 
are to the extreme right and those who are social democrats!''' 
The struggle continued from July to the first of October, and 
the public became convined that there was a serious conflict 
between the coalition partners, as well as quarrels over 
leadership positions in the ministries and directorships, 
including those in the mass media, and finally, a symptom of a 
profound government crisis. 
<H5>  ``Someone Is Profiting From Us'' </H5>
  The article continues that the LP has also had internal 
conflicts, but has been characteristically lucky in that they 
have not attracted much attention from the public. For example, 
assembly representative Djulistana Markovska left the party 
after accusing party leader Andov of absolutism and of working 
exclusively with a small clique. Last August, Andov was also 
involved in a scandal involving an accident with an official 
Mercedes on the Skopje-Tetovo road and the subsequent police 
disclosures about the incident. 
  Moreover, the LP became the center of attention in the 
confrontation between Zoran Krstevski, the director of the 
public enterprise ``Makedonija'' for airport services and 
coordinator of the LP parliamentary group, and Antoni Pesev, 
then Minister of Urban Planning, Construction, Communications, 
Transportation, and Ecology. The dispute concerned supplies of 
aviation fuel. One of five bidders was the company of Risto 
Gusterov, a member of the leadership committee of the LP and a 
well-known businessman. According to a memorandum prepared for 
Minister Pesev, the choice of Gusterov would be prohibited 
unless the required management committee of a public enterprise 
was formed. After Krstevski openly expressed his opposition to 
excluding Gusterov's private company, the minutes of the meeting 
compiled by the Ministry, which were then leaked, showed that 
the Liberals, through their influence in ``Makedonija'' were 
attempting to evade the government's policy. 
  The author mentions another scandal, involving former Deputy 
Prime Minister Risto Ivanov, who was also a member of the 
highest leadership body of the LP. Ivanov wrote a letter to the 
township public prosecutor and the district court in Skopje II 
last September, ``requesting to be informed about the process of 
a criminal case, as well as the basis for the arrest warrant 
against a judge from the district economic court in Skopje, who 
was accused of taking a bribe. In his reply, the chairman of the 
court expressed constrernation about the tone of Ivanov's 
letter, reminding him of the constitutional separation of powers 
among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Only a 
few days later, Minister of Justice Tuse Gosev repeated the 
judge's argument, characterizing the entire proceeding as a 
result of `Deputy Prime Minister Ivanov's legal ignorance.''' 
This led to Ivanov's resignation. 
  ``Despite the disagreements, confrontations, and affairs, 
the 
LP should be seen as a real and potentially active political 
factor in the country with a clear ideological perspective. Its 
motto--the adept will succeed with us--is attractive to a great 
number of well-known intellectuals, successful businessmen, and 
entrepreneurs who have joined its ranks.'' The LP is also the 
only party in Macedonia which is accepted internationally, being 
a member of the Federation of European Liberal, Democratic, and 
Reform Parties. As far as the approaching elections are 
concerned, Stojan Andov relies on the electorate's intelligence. 
He views ``the disinformation against the LP as evidence that 
certain circles in the country are frightened by the party's 
prospects in the coming election.'' Despite this, Andov says 
that an electoral coalition with the Social Democrats is 
possible since both parties support the democratic development 
of Macedonia. 
<H5>  Socialist Party </H5>
  A two part essay by Emil Sterjevski appears on 30 and 31 
January, both on page 3--the 1,000-word ``From a Union to a 
Transformed Party,'' and the 800-word ``Is It Hard To Be A 
Coalition Partner?'' 
  ``Many dilemnas have followed the transformation of the 
`broadest front of the progressive forces' of the working people 
of Macedonia into the Socialist Party of Macedonia.'' One basic 
problem was the fact that many of its members were 
simultaneously connected with the League of Communists. There 
was also a problem of collective membership and the difficulty 
of deciding whether to be a party or a movement. 
<H5>  ``Discontinuity or...'' </H5>
  Kiro Popovski, chairman of the Socialist Party of Macedonia, 
SP, refers to the ``deep roots and tradition'' of socialism, 
going back 100 years to the time of Delcev, Glavinov, and Karev, 
as well as the days of the People's Liberation Front during 
World War II. On 28 September 1990, at the founding meeting in 
Skopje, the party adopted the compromise name, Socialist Union - 
Socialist Party, and a draft program, statute, and emblem was 
chosen for the elections. ``In the first multiparty 
parliamentary elections, the SP ran and won four seats 
independently, and won one seat in conjunction with the Union of 
Reformist Forces of Macedonia, and one seat with the cooperation 
of the Party for the Complete Emancipation of the Romanies. 
Their share in the parliament thus amounted to five percent of 
the total. That is also the share that it has in the governing 
coalition; it also has 12 percent of the total members of local 
assemblies in the Republic.'' In that parliamentary election 
campaign, the SP promoted the idea of ```a sovereign and 
democratic Macedonian state as an equal economic, political, and 
social entity in Yugoslavia, in the Balkans, and in Europe.''' 
Between the first and second rounds of the election, the SP 
agreed to a cooperative arrangement with the Union of Reformist 
Forces. 
  At its June 1991 congress, Popovski reaffirmed the view that 
the only choice was a democratic way to discuss a new 
Yugoslavia, as an association of equal republics as sovereign 
states. There was sharp criticism of nationalist tendencies and 
the misuse of patriotic feelings by various parties in their 
promotional efforts. ```Macedonia should be seen as a 
nation-state of the Macedonian people and the common homeland of 
all citizens. Multiethnic relations imply ethnic and religious 
toleration.''' 
  Unlike other parties, the author says the SP has not had 
internal disputes. Membership has been relatively stable. 
  He continues, the SP is the smallest and most loyal member 
of 
the governing coalition, but it has sometimes been left out of 
negotiations among the partners. The SP's share in government 
positions is one deputy chairmanship in the Assembly and one 
minister in the government. 
  The SP has recently sketched out its version of 
privatization, calling for 20 percent of the shares of the 
enterprises to be given free of charge to the respective 
workers. The SP's problem is how to overcome its faceless image 
and to sharpen its distinctiveness as a party of the left, while 
remaining amenable to a coaltion of the center, occupied by the 
SDSM and LP. It eshews nationalism as a retrograde phenomenon. 
<H5>  Labor Party </H5>
  A 1,300-word article by Emil Sterjevski appears in the 1 
February issue on page 3, entitled ``Results Better Than 
Investment.'' Sterjevski writes, continuing the tradition of the 
workers' movement, the Labor Party (RP) emerged as a new party 
in 1990. In the first multiparty elections, it won 3.4 percent 
of the vote, which was below the threshold for entering the 
parliament. Despite the class connotations of its name, the RP 
did not use aggressive rhetoric in its election campaign, nor 
has it resorted to such language since then in its press 
communiques. 
  On 24 June 1990, the RP held its initial assembly. It waited 
until August to register officially. According to its statute, 
the RP should hold its next party congress in June 1994. Krste 
Jankoski, the party leader, says that the RP began its political 
activity with no supplies, infrastructure, or personnel. By 
making the best of minimal means in the election campaign, the 
RP came out surprisingly well. Jankoski claims that the 
membership is stable and well distributed in terms of levels of 
education. The majority of the members are those who have been 
the most marginalized and hurt by the so-called transition 
period; they are also from the middle and lower social strata. 
  ``The RP, in fact, does not appear attractive for the 
reasons 
mentioned above.'' Yet, it was one of the few parties which in 
the beginning was not preoccupied with the controversial issue 
of Macedonian statehood and nationality. ``In its program, which 
has remained unchanged since the elections, the RP considered 
the inviolability of the territorial sovereignty of Macedonia as 
follows: `The RP pledges itself to Macedonia as a common 
homeland of equal citizens and communities, regardless of 
whether they live in Macedonia or anywhere else in the world.' 
At that time, the party favored a `Yugoslavia as a federation 
and community of free and sovereign peoples who should 
consensually and equally determine the bases for a common 
life....''' The RP supported the referendum on independence. Its 
position on the ethnic issue favors the conception of a civic 
state, rather than a purely national one and the protection of 
the rights of minorities according to international conventions. 
  ``In July 1992, as well as in July 1993, the RP organized 
meetings under the provocative slogan: `We have nothing tell the 
government.' The meetings elicited varying reactions from the 
public and political entities and also led to internal friction. 
The deputy chairman and some of his supporters registered a new 
party with the name, Labor Party of Macedonia.'' 
  Along with its priority on fairness to workers, the RP is 
against what it calls ```the unprincipled privatization of 
socially-owned capital, its destruction, and plundering without 
an accounting to its initiators.''' The RP is not against 
privatization per se, however. It opposes ``neoliberal'' 
privatization schemes that it views as leading to a Latin 
American type society with a small minority of wealthy people 
and an impoverished majority. 
  The author concludes that the RP appears to have a stable 
core of support--about 2.9 percent according to BriMa polls. Its 
expectations for the coming election are slim, however. 
<H5>  Democratic Party of Turks </H5>
  The 2 February issue of NOVA MAKEDONIJA carries a 1,000-word 
article by Aleksandar Danovski on page 4, headlined ``An 
Association Is Transformed Into a Party.'' 
  ``The beginning of political organizations among the ethnic 
groups in the country following the trend--one party, one 
people--produced something unique when it involved the Turks.'' 
The Turks already were organized in a Democratic Union of Turks 
(DST), which was removed from the register as a civic 
organzation on 17 July 1992. On 16 October 1992, it registered 
as a political party under the name, Democratic Party of Turks. 
Its leader was Erdogan Sarac. 
  The party soon came to public attention through its role in 
the dispute over education in the Turkish language in the town 
of Zupa, in Debar township. On 8 April 1993, the party 
complained of discrimination and called on Turks to resettle in 
Turkey if conditions did not improve. Some local problems were 
described as tantamount to a ```genocide of the Turks in 
Macedonia.''' 
  At the same time, however, the DPT called on the Turkish 
minority to support the referendum for a sovereign and 
independent state, the new constitution, and the process of 
recognition. The party also appealed for the resolution of 
problems through dialogue and through institutions in the system 
in keeping with the Turkish community's traditions of tolerance 
and peacefulness. 
  Toward the end of 1993, there was an internal dispute over 
allegations of mistakes by Serac and others in the party 
leadership. The DPT's meeting was closed to journalists, and 
Serac claims that there was complete agreement about the party's 
leadership. 
<H5>  Movement for All-Macedonian Action </H5>
  A 1,300-word article by Emil Sterjevski appears on page 4 
entitled ``The Program Achieved, the Members Lost.'' 
  ``One of the first political parties to appear on the 
pluralistic political scene was the Movement for All-Macedonian 
Action--MAAK. In addition to its name, the lion as a protective 
symbol, and a political program, MAAK behaved very radically. 
The public was simply divided when the question arose over 
sympathy toward a party with such a nationalistic orientation. 
MAAK was registered in the first half of June 1990, and, at 
about that point, there was talk about two parties--MAAK and the 
League for Democracy--attracting and dividing Macedonia's 
intelligentsia along nationalistic or civic lines.'' 
  ``MAAK defined itself as th fatherland party of the 
Macedonians and of all citizens of Macedonia `regardless of 
their social, ethnic, or religious adherence, who accept the 
Proclamation and the Program Declaration and Manifesto of MAAK 
for a Free, Independent, and Sovereign Macedonia.' The Movement 
for All Macedonian Action came forward with the position that 
`the Macedonian people will not permit themselves to be seduced 
in games whose goal is the re-establishment of some abbreviated, 
asymmetrical Yugoslavia;' this was contained in its program 
before the parliamentary elections. The party considered 12 
August 1913 [the date of signing of the Treaty of Bucharest, 
dividing Macedonia among Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria] as the 
day of the Macedonian national catastrophe.'' 
  ``For MAAK, 1990 was the year of `political action.' After 
its founding assembly at which only a working presidency was 
elected (February 1990), members of a National Committee were 
elected one month later, and on 2 August - Ilinden [St.Elias's 
Day, anniversary of the 1903 uprising against the Turks] in 
Prohor Pcinjski, the Manifesto for a Free, Independent and 
Sovereign Macedonia was proclaimed. MAAK also demanded the 
withdrawal of our specialists from Kosovo and the departure of 
the JNA. In Prilep, they commemorated the anniverary of the 
death of Metodija-Andonov-Cento, and in Ohrid, they marked the 
1000th anniversary of the Samuil Kingdom.'' 
  ``A year later, MAAK held the second part of its assembly 
and 
proclaimed the Declaration on the Demilitarization of the 
Republic of Macedonia. The result of all these signs of 
incongruence with mainstream views was a fiasco - not a single 
seat in parliament, but representation in almost half of the 
opstina councils. Some parties could have been satisfied with 
those results, but not the proud Movement for All Macedonian 
Action.'' 
  ``On 12 November 1990, the so-called National Front, 
comprising MAAK, VMRO-DPMNE, the People's Party, and the 
Agrarian Party, was formed. This turned out to be a tactical 
mistake for MAAK because the party had assumed that it could set 
policy for the Front.'' MAAK also suffered from internal 
contradictions, especially over the arrival of U.S. soldiers as 
part of the UNPROFOR in 1993, which was at odds with MAAK's 
views on demilitarization. 
  In September 1992, MAAK began a campaign to collect 
signatures for a petition calling for early parliamentary 
elections. The party got 128,000, to which the VMRO-DPMNE was 
supposed to add 30,000 in order to reach the 150,000 stipulated 
by the Constitution. Little seems to have come of this effort. 
MAAK appears to be losing members to other parties, particularly 
the VMRO-DPMNE and the Democratic Party. 
  MAAK's position on the ethnic Albanian question is described 
by Deputy Chairman Levko Djambazovski: ```The Macedonian people 
in their own state should restore the relationship between the 
state and the minority. But the minority does not feel any 
attachment to the state; they only demand rights. They should 
enjoy all the rights that minorities are accorded by 
international conventions, but rights are founded on 
reciprocity. The Constitution should be respected. If something 
should be changed, the Macedonian people should change it if 
they consider that necessary. Changes made because of dictates 
from outsiders, especially from blood enemies of the country 
would mean trampling the dignity of the people and demonstrating 
the immaturity of the state.'' As yet, MAAK does not have a 
developed economic platform, but it tends to favor support for 
the agricultural sector. 
<H5>  Party for the Full Emancipation of Romanies (PCERM) </H5>
  In a 1,400-word article on 4 February by Lilica Kitanovska 
on 
page 4, entitled ``Party for Social Emancipation,'' the author 
writes: ``In its election program, the Party for the Full 
Emancipation of Romanies [Gypsies] stated that the party has a 
profoundly humane and democratic Macedonian and Yugoslav 
character, that it would share equally in government, and that 
it is prepared for a dialogue with all progressive forces, as 
well as to support changes in the economy and the programs of 
the Federal Government of Yugoslavia. PCERM would also struggle 
for a better life for the unemployed and for the stability of 
Macedonia and Yugoslavia within the borders of Europe, and vice 
versa! This is only part of the confused way of presenting its 
demands for a place in the sun under the new democratic 
conditions with which the Romanies rushed about, demonstrating 
their lack of preparedness while strongly showing their desire 
to seize the initative. However, as Faik Abdi, the popular 
representative and leader of the PCERM says: `It was very 
difficult to persuade Romanies to join the party. According to 
Abdi, the Romanies were afraid of parties; they thought they 
would be sent to prison for forming a party! They were convinced 
that someone should defend them, teach them, identify things for 
them....So, that is why we formed the PCERM. We explained to 
them that, after a protracted analysis, we had come to the 
conclusion that we are the most backward part of the population 
and that no one would undertake to integrate us into the social 
mainstream without distinguishing where we live.''' 
  ``Thus, in the second half of 1990, the first party of 
Romanies was formed, but up until the elections, it was unable 
to develop additonal structures. There were only some branches 
in Skopje and its suburbs, Tetovo, Gostivar, Debar, and 
Kumanovo. According to Abdi, it was determined that the Romanies 
were the most illiterate, the most frequent users of public 
welfare, the earliest to marry, and, all in all, the Romanies 
needed a genuine struggle for emancipation.'' 
  ``PCERM mainly saw emancipation through improving living 
standards.'' It proved difficult to make progress in this area. 
However, Abdi could point to some success. ``For the first time 
in history, Romanies were brought into the constitution of a 
state, and not as an ethnic group or national minority, but as a 
nation which lived along side with the Macedonians and could 
consider the country as its homeland.'' The significance of this 
step was lost on some people who, criticizing PCERM's passivity, 
formed another party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). 
  According to Kitanovska, conflicts between the two Romany 
parties concerned the use of flour donated by enterprises and 
distributed by Abdi, who was accused of absolutist tendencies 
and of diverting some of the charity. The DPP also thought that 
Abdi's solution to the introduction of bilingual education for 
Romanies meant acquiescence in the slow pace of change. 
  Up to now, PCERM has generally adhered to official 
government 
policy. As its only representative in the assembly, Abdi has 
earned the sobriquet ``cushion'' because he steers a course 
between the government and the nationalist opposition. ``Not so 
much by the force of his arguments, as by his desire to calm the 
passions of the opponents, Faik Abdi has often succeeded in 
cutting the discussions, which because of their sterility should 
be relegated to the background.'' 
  ``The best demonstration of the loyalty of this party to 
Macedonia is its support for the referendum in which it 
mobilized 98.3 percent of the Romany electorate to vote. 
However, that positive aspect of the PCERM was interrupted by 
the party's indulgence in talk of a new state with the name 
Romanistan in March 1993. In a letter sent to Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, there was a call for an order creating an area in 
which Romanies from all over the world could find a home where 
they would be welcome.'' To date, PCERM has not officially 
renounced this idea, which seemed justified in its view by the 
merciless genocide of the past, but the party has nothing 
against the current residence of the Romanies in Macedonia. 
  The writer asserts that a final cause of friction between 
PCERM and ``non-Romanies'' concerns the number of members of 
this ethnic group in Macedonia. PCERM claims that there are no 
less than 220,000, while the 1991 census put the number at 
52,000. PCERM explains the discrepancy as a result of the 
mistrust of Romanies toward Macedonian census takers and the 
Romanies' lack of organization. The Romanies were also said to 
have accepted the officials' description of them in exchange for 
paved roads in their neighborhoods. PCERM deserves credit, 
however, for its moderation since it is essential that the 
Romanies be integrated into society. It is also significant that 
the agreement with the German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen for 
the resettlement of Gypsies who claimed asylum in Germany also 
puts the Romanies in a position to put forward their demands. 
  Although the PCERM now has a membership of 36,000, Abdi 
worries about the divisive effect of elections and the spawning 
of new parties trying to attract the Romany constituency. 
Despite this danger, he forecasts a parliamentary group of six 
or seven Romany representatives in the new Assembly. As to 
whether PCERM would have a working alliance with the Socialist 
Party again, things appear less certain. According to Abdi, 
PCERM would ally with those parties which can contribute to the 
realization of PCERM's goals. 
<H5>  League for Democracy </H5>
  A 1,300-word article by Zoran Petrov, entitled ``Neither 
Communism Nor Nationalism--Democracy Here,'' was included in the 
3 February edition on page 4. 
  Petrov says that the League for Democracy made its debut on 
the pluralistic stage with great pomp and attracted the cream of 
intellectual and progressive civic circles. It is the only 
political organization that does not fit into the scheme of 
these essays since its existence ended 10 months ago. However, 
from the standpoint of its significance, influence, and 
contribution to the development of democracy in Macedonia, the 
League has earned respect and a distinctive place in Macedonian 
political life. 
  On 21 November 1989 the party's platform was made public, 
and 
on 11 February 1990 the constituent assembly of the League for 
Democracy was convened in Skopje. The party was registered on 8 
July 1990. It held its first congress on 21 November 1992. It 
was disbanded in May 1993. Although the League failed to gain 
representation in parliament, it was active outside the Assembly 
and demonstrated its interest in participating in the creation 
of Macedonia's domestic and foreign policies. 
<H5>  ``Eschewing Wooly Language'' </H5>
  The League's enduring image was that of a classic, or 
old-fashioned, civic party, non-nationalistic, self-critical, 
not secretive, and responsible in its internal operations. It 
was also anti-communist and focused on the ideal of Macedonia as 
a state governed by rule of law. Along with its demands for 
denationalization of property, the League advocated the return 
of church property to the Macedonian Orthodox Church, 
privatization of socially-owned property, local self-government, 
changing the name and symbols of the Macedonain state from the 
socialist ones, and reform of the criminal code. According to 
its 29 June 1990 platform, the League was also the first to 
suggest rehabilitation and restitution for those sentenced by 
the Communists and for the principle of reciprocity in relations 
with neighboring countries. 
  Despite all this, the first parliamentary elections were a 
fiasco for the League even in the first round. With the 
exception of two or three candidates, no one received the 
required number of votes for the run-off. The League won one 
seat on the local council in Sveti Nikole. The party filed 
complaints to the Supreme Court concerning the electoral 
process, citing especially procedures in Kumanovo and Kratovo. 
The League managed to bring these problems to the attention of 
the public and to induce the prosecution of a case involving 
financial irregularities during the campaign on behalf of the 
SKM-PDP, SPM, and SRSM. 
  ``The League was also the first party to publish its 
positions, ideas, and recommendations in its own newspaper, 
DEMOKRATSKI FORUM, the first issue of which appeared on 29 June 
1990.'' The party's public image was greatly influenced by its 
chairman Djordji Marjanovic, a professor of criminal law at 
Skopje University's Law Department, who criticized the 
government and certain conditions and tendencies in the country 
in a forthright manner and without mincing words. His 
description of the current governing coalition as ```a 
politically contradictory debachery of the Macedonian 
crypto-communists and Albanians nationalists''' is now famous. 
  In the fall of 1992, in two of three parliamentary 
by-elections, the League did surprisingly well. In the 111th 
district in the Skopje region of Centar, League candidate 
Aleksandar Tortevski came in second after Nikola Popovski of the 
SDSM, and ahead of VMRO-DPMNE and LP candidates. The League's 
candidate placed third in the 90th district in Gazi Baba. 
Despite these signs of popularity, the League disbanded itself 
half a year later. 
<H5>  ``Last Stop: The Democratic Party'' </H5>
  As Marjanovic explained in the July 1993 issue of 
DEMOKRATSKI 
FORUM, the League for Democracy merged with the Petar Gosev's 
Democratic Party, sacrificing its individuality and centrist 
orientation for the sake of the evolution of a rule-of-law state 
and for the well-being of the Macedonian people. The Democratic 
Party was formed in April 1993 by Petar Gosev, former chairman 
of the SKM-PDP who left its successor organization the SDSM. In 
addition to the League, the Ilinden Free Democrats, who had left 
the VMRO-DPMNE; the Party of the Greens; and the Revival Party 
of Ohrid joined the Democratic Party. The League contributed six 
people to the 15-member Republic Council of the DP. The 
Democratic Party, led by three representatives on the Republic 
Council--Petar Gosev, Mihail Panovski, and Risto Jovanov, is 
actively preparing for the November elections. 
<H5>  NPD </H5>
  Penta Djambozoski is the author of a 1,200-word essay 
appearing on page 4 on 6 February, entitled ``In the Shadow of 
the Ethnic Brother.'' 
  ``The People's Democratic Party, headquartered in Tetovo, 
was 
registered on 1 August 1990, and its constituent assembly was 
held a fews days before on Sunday when Iljaz Halimi was elected 
chairman and Ibrahim Bedredin secretary.'' The party's activity 
is intended to promote the ethnic demands of the Albanians in 
Macedonia and to establish their status as a state-forming 
people.`` The NPD is almost universally considered radical even 
when compared to the largest ethnic Albanian party, the PDP. It 
is important not to minimize the significance of the NPD on the 
Macedonian political scene because it achieved notable results 
in the first multiparty elections. The NPD entered the 
Macedonian parliament with one seat in the PDP-NPD coalition and 
with a significant number of representatives in the city 
councils in Skopje, Kumanovo, Tetovo, Gostivar, Debar, Kicevo, 
and Struga, where it is in a coalition with the PDP. Indeed, the 
NPD's political and party activism did not perhaps meet a 
corresponding interest from the public, thus extending a hand to 
the mass-based PDP was a necessity for the party to have a more 
influential role on our political scene.'' 
  Djambozoski writes, in general, it should be noted that the 
NPD has not been careless, particularly in dealing with the most 
essential questions, such as relations with key government 
bodies and arguments over the status of Albanians. It has, 
however, been sharply critical of the government. ``Under the 
guidance of the NPD and PDP, the 1991 census and the Referendum 
on the Future of Macedonia were boycotted by the Albanian 
minority. The NPD asserted that the number of Albanians in 
Macedonia amounted to somewhere around 40 percent of the entire 
population. But this party reacted even more sharply with 
respect to the adoption of the Constitution of the Republic of 
Macedonia than its arguments in favor of a tolerant dialogue 
seemed to imply. With uncompomising and strident language, the 
NPD depicted the Constitutional Commission as `a tailor of the 
Serbian agenda in Macedonia,' compared living conditions in 
Macedonia (at any rate those of Albanians) with those in Serbia, 
and set forth the prognosis that `the Constiution will be the 
obituary for the Republic of Macedonia.''' From the beginning 
of its activities, the NPD placed great hopes in the courts and 
in the international community, which ```would treat Macedonia 
as it had Serbia''' with respect to human rights. 
<H5>  ``Evaluating the Program'' </H5>
  ``In 1992 the Constitutional Court of Macedonia had many 
interesting but complicated tasks to perform in reviewing the 
constitutionality of the party's program, that is, the Political 
Declaration of the NPD.'' Besides the question of deciding 
whether that Declaration predated the Constitution. There was 
also the problem of whether toleration of dissent included 
changing the political system in a legal way. ``Considering that 
the declaration contained terms such as genocide, assimilation, 
and terror, a determination had to be made concerning whether 
the declaration's intent was to achieve the status of Albanians 
as a people on the way to political agreement or a decision to 
seek a common ethnic association and the formation of a single 
Albanian state in the Balkans!'' That would be contrary to 
Article 20, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution, but the 
Constitutional Court did not attack the NPD, suggesting instead 
that it alter the program. 
  ``A year and a half later, the NPD proposed a definition of 
Macedonia as a state of equal citizens with a bicameral 
parliament and the possibility of it becoming a federation. This 
suggestion was placed in the context of the International 
Conference on the Former Yugoslavia in Geneva. The NPD decided 
in favor of a democratic and sovereign state of citizens and 
equal nations--the Macedonian and the Albanian--with other 
nationalities and ethnic groups living there. Certainly, the 
position of the NPD with respect to the status of the Republic 
of Macedonia on the international level should be remembered: 
the NPD was against Macedonia's recognition and admittance to 
the CSCE [Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]. 
This was at the same time the Republic of Albania justified its 
blocking of Macedonia's CSCE membership because of the 
`inequality of the Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia.''' 
<H5>  ``A Dose of Populism'' </H5>
  ``At about that time, the NPD sent an open letter to the 
President of the Republic of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov with the 
observation that `the faith of Albanians living in Macedonia in 
state institutions, including that of the republic's presidency, 
will soon disappear entirely' because of the disregard for the 
justified demands of the Albanians. The element of populism in 
the political behavior of this party and demonstrated in this 
letter is striking because it is addressed to all Albanians. 
When the issue of the constitution came up, the NPD proposed and 
supported a draft for cantonization and repeatedly denied the 
statement that `the Albanians do not demand autonomy.''' It is 
also notable that the NPD does not issue statements in the name 
of its members, but in the name of Albanians in the Republic of 
Macedonia, despite the existence of the PDP and the Albanian 
Democratic Union - Liberal Party. 
  The NPD views the affair of the paramilitary organization of 
Albanians and the arrest of eight members, including a former 
PDP official, with suspicion that it was meant to coincide with 
trials of Albanians in Kosovo and that the jailed individuals 
are victims of political machinations by the governing coalition. 
  ``In anticipation of the second parliamentary elections, the 
NPD is already thinking of more advantageous electoral results. 
Some of its positions expressed ealier can now be realized in 
view of the great political schism in the largest ethnic 
Albanian party, the PDP. Thus, the NPD reiterates that the 
membership of the PDP in the governing coalition (the NPD is not 
in the governing coalition although its only parliamentary 
representative is in the coalition group PDP-NPD) presents a 
defeat and a great political mistake because `from that 
government, the Albanian people endure not only discrimination, 
but also stern repression.''' This leaves the question of 
whether the NPD will cooperate with the PDP in the November 
elections in doubt. 
<H5>  Democratic Party of Serbs in Macedonia </H5>
  A 1,200-word article by Aleksandar Damovski appears on page 
4 
of the 7 February issue, headlined ``Lost Coordinates.'' 
  ```The idea of forming our party arose about May or June 
1990, when many political parties were being formed in Macedonia 
and the Bolshevik system was collapsing. But, at that time, the 
Serbs in Macedonia were not able to assemble to form a party. 
There was eagerness among the people. The old regime was still 
apreading indoctrination and embraced the ethnic freedom of the 
Serbs in Macedonia....yielding to international public opinion, 
international media, and domestic opinion, the government 
decided to register our party on 16 March 1992.''' 
  ``In the above statement, Boro Ristic, then chairman of the 
Democratic Party of Serbs (DPS), answered the question about the 
origins of the party in the first issue of SRPSKA REC, a 
bulletin of the city committee of the Association of Serbs and 
Montenegrins in Macedonia.'' The founding of the party was 
accompanied by the marketing of the idea of a threat of 
```national and spiritual annihilation.''' 
  The DPS's policies have been complicated by the fact that 
the 
party ``has constantly been turning for guidance toward the 
north,'' that is, toward Serbia. One sign of this is that the 
party leadership cooperates with representatives of the Serbian 
media in Skopje, rather than with the Macedonian media. The 
author continues that as a result of the party's activities, 
there have been direct clashes between the police and a militant 
section of the party. The conflicts frequently occur in the 
village of Kuceviste in the Skopje region. Following an incident 
there on New Year's Eve, the DPS declared at a press conference 
that ``to the extent that discrimination against the Serbs is 
not resolved in a democratic manner, we will be obliged to take 
measures to protect ourselves, among which we will consider help 
from our motherland.'' The party has also announced the forming 
of a crisis staff and the organization of a referendum to 
clarify Macedonia's status and the defining of the Serbs as a 
constitutent (state-forming) people. A day earlier, on 15 
January, there were calls in Kuceviste: ``Long Live Arkan!,'' 
``Long Live Seselj!,'' and ``Serbia, Serbia!'' 
  In such an atmosphere, the political evolution of the DPS 
was 
prolonged. Contacts were kept with Pahomije, the Serbian 
Orthodox Bishop in Vranje, and demands were made for religious 
services in Serbo-Croatian, even in villages with no Serbs. The 
party also expressed its dissatisfaction with the 1991 census, 
claiming that there were 200,000-300,000 Serbs in Macedonia, 
instead of the official count of about 40,000. 
  ``A very unexpected development came in August 1993 when a 
representative of the Macedonian Government, Internal Affairs 
Minister Ljubomir Frckovski--whose resignation the DPS had 
demanded in the wake of the `New Year's celebration' in 
Kuceviste--signed an agreement with DPS leader Ristic to resolve 
the disputed issue of the status of the Serbs in Macedonia. This 
was also under the auspices of Gerd Ahrens, who was responsible 
for ethnic issues in the framework of the Conference on the 
Former Yugoslavia. One of the principal demands of the DPS was 
the inclusion of the Serbs in the Constitution as a nation; this 
was to be accomplished in 18 months.'' The agreement was soon 
denounced by ```a radical current.''' This group became 
stronger, and Ristic resigned, citing ```strong outside 
influence in the creation of party policy, especially by the 
Socialist Party and Radical Party, both from Serbia, as well as 
from the Serbian Orthodox Church, whose five senile seniors from 
the Holy Archepiscopal Synod are unable to recognize the 
existence of the Macedonian people, the Macedonian nation, and 
the Macedonian Orthodox Church.'' 
  ``After the election of Dragisa Miletic as chairman of the 
DPS, and after the party's short-lived turning toward the real 
terrain where it found itself, the DPS returned to its old 
coordinates. Whereas it had used the word `Macedonia,' it now 
employs only `VJRM' [FYROM]; it does not respect basic human and 
religious rights. The press conferences are held only for 
journalists from the Serbian media who reside in Macedonia.'' 
Instead of entering the Constitution as a state-forming people, 
there are accusations of ```ethnic and spiritual annihilation 
and assimilation.''' For the new chairman, Miletic, ```The Serbs 
in Macedonia are part of a nation whose president is Slobodan 
Milosevic.''' 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The final, 1,200-word, article in the series, by ``V.R.,'' 
appears on 8 February on page 4, and is entitled ``Losing Ground 
After the Elections.'' 
  ``V.R.'' writes, the period from the beginning of 1990 until 
the first multiparty elections (November-December 1990) was the 
time for intensive registering of political parties. Seeing 
their chance in the pluralistic environment, some playing the 
card of democratic change, others appealing to national 
feelings, in all about 20 parties emerged with their own 
programs and candidates in the elections. The majority, however, 
did not succeed in securing a place for their representatives, 
either in the republic-level parliament or in the township 
councils.`` The process of establishing new parties did not end 
after the elections. On the contrary, many new parties were 
registered and there were cases in which internal disagreements 
or conflicts over ideas led to the formation of new parties with 
almost the same names. At least on paper, some 60 parties now 
exist. 
  One of the parties, which succeeded in winning two seats in 
the republic-level parliament, a party that has probably now 
been forgotten, according to the writer, by most Macedonians, is 
the Party of Yugoslavs. Today, their representatives in the 
assembly are Risto Kelesov, who won a majority in Kumanovo, and 
Risto Stamenov, a candidate for the party from Strumica. The 
party, which was registered at the end of May 1990, emphasized 
at the time of the elections the need to maintain the integrity 
of the Yugoslav federation. Since then, the Party of Yugoslavs 
has held two congresses, the first in May 1991 and the second in 
June 1993. At the second congress, the party issued a program 
and statute and changed its name to Party of Yugoslavs in 
Macedonia - Yugoslav Unionist Civic Alliance (PJM-JUGA). 
Political groupings with similar programs and names can be found 
today in Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina. Today, the 
main prescription of the party is reduced to pledging to restore 
the Yugoslav federation in some form with mutual recognition of 
all the former Yugoslav republics. 
  ``In the short period between the first and second rounds of 
voting in the first multiparty elections, the so-called National 
Front, comprising four nationalist parties--the VMRO-DPMNE, 
MAAK, the People's Party of Macedonia (NPM), and the Party of 
Peasants of Macedonia--briefly entered the scene. Today, much is 
said about who profited and who lost in the formation of the 
Front during the period of nationalistic euphoria. The NPM 
evolved from the `United Macedonians' Association, which was 
formed in February 1990. It held its first assembly the same 
day, 12 April 1990, that the Law on Political Parties was 
adopted. Its first, and as yet only, congress was held on 26 May 
1991, and Vladimir Stefanovski was elected chairman. The new 
party chose the name People's Party of Macedonia at that time. 
According to Stefanovski, the NPM is nationalistic, but not 
national-chauvinistic. The NPM does not spread enmity toward 
others; it advocates love toward one's own nation.'' The NPM was 
the first to use the sun emblem which is now used on Macedonia's 
flag. Although the party now views joining the National Front as 
a mistake, it was the initiator of the front. In the first round 
of the elections, the NPM won 27,000 votes, or about two percent 
of the total votes cast, placing it in eighth place among the 19 
competing parties. When its agreement with the National Front 
fell through, the NPM urged a boycott of the second round. 
Today, the NPM's membership is about 2,000. 
  ``Another member of the National Front was the Democratic 
Union - Party of Peasants of Macedonia. Based in the village of 
Gorni Podlag in Kucani and Novo Selo in the Strumica region, the 
party was registered at the beginning of June 1990. Dimitar 
Galev was elected chairman.'' Disappointed at the election 
outcome and the short-lived National Front, the party seems 
inactive today. 
  ``The first party to register on the pluralistic Macedonian 
scene was the Social Democratic Party of Macedonia. It came into 
being with great ambitions, above all for the promotion of 
social democracy in Macedonia and with a cadre of intellectuals 
who would make their debut in the elections. Slavko 
Milosavlevski was elected as the first chairman of the party.'' 
After the party's poor showing in the elections, it has become 
rather inactive. The current chairman is Tihomir Jovanovski. 
  The writer concludes, considering the still unresolved 
issues 
of party financing and opportunities for conducting electoral 
campaigns, the situation as Macedonia approaches the November 
elections appears fluid, with some 60 parties now competing for 
support.

  [Text] Usti Nad Labem, North Bohemia, May 21 (CTK) -- 
Delegates at the first congress of the Czech Borderlands Club 
(KCP) have called on President Vaclav Havel to retract his 
apology for the expulsion of the Sudeten German population from 
Czechoslovakia after World War Two. Havel has on several 
occasions condemned the expulsions, which were the result of 
decrees made by President Edvard Benes in 1945 and which 
affected over 2.5 million people. 
  The Czech Borderlands Club was formed in 1992 in an attempt 
to counter the "Germanisation" of Czech border regions and now 
has 10,000 registered members. 
  The KCP congress sent a letter today to the Czech government 
and parliament protesting against the possibility of Czech NATO 
membership and involvement in the Partnership for Peace project. 
The club demands Czech neutrality. 
  Participants applauded as they heard deputy Kvetoslava 
Celisova (Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia) dismiss 
parliament as a body of people enriching themselves at other 
people's expense and Ognan Tuleskov (chairman of the 
non-parliamentary Christian Social Movement) declare that 
government coalition parties were financed by German foundations. 
  Speakers reviled the government for condoning Germany's 
economic "Drang nach Osten' ("push to the east") and condemned 
the "humiliating rate of the Czech crown in relation to the 
German mark". 
  Among delegates were former Communist Party general 
secretary 
for the Usti district Vaclav Sipek, communist-era 
editor-in-chief of the daily RUDE PRAVO Zdenek Horeni and other 
erstwhile functionaries of the communist regime.

  [Excerpts] Nuremberg, May 22 (CTK) -- The right to 
homeland for the 2.5 million Sudeten Germans expelled from the 
former Czechoslovakia after the Second World War was supported 
by representatives of both the Federal and the Bavarian 
governments at the 45th Sudeten German Congress today. [passage 
omitted] 
  Kanther told the congress participants that the German 
government would be on their side whenever "it was a question of 
moving the right to homeland a step forward towards its full 
recognition and realisation." 
  He said that Germans wanted to live with Czechs as peaceful 
neighbours. It was thus necessary to solve problems together, 
and this also meant together with the Sudeten Germans. 
  "Sudeten Germans have to be integrated into future 
German-Czech relations with great calm and matter-of-factness, 
in a spirit of friendship and reconciliation and the abandoning 
of revanchism," Kanther said. It would help attempts at 
understanding when "those responsible in the Czech Republic 
recognise it as a priority of mutual relations." 
  "I know that dialogue between Sudeten Germans and our Czech 
neighbours will not be simple," Kanther said. He also stressed 
that normalisation of the situation in Central and Eastern 
Europe was in the German interest. 
  He omitted from the prepared version of his speech, which 
met 
with only measured applause, a more vigorously formulated 
passage addressed to the Czech government. 
  Stoiber's speech was clearly motivated by the June elections 
to the European parliament and the September elections to the 
Bavarian Land Assembly. He praised Czech-Bavarian cooperation, 
but said it was lacking in discussion between Prague and the 
Sudeten Germans. "What is missing is political dialogue between 
the Czech government, the Czech parliament, and elected 
representatives of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft 
(countrymen's association)" he said. 
  "Rejecting dialogue is not politics," he said, adding that 
he 
believed this policy "harmed a good neighbourly relationship." 
He also called upon German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to 
"put this dialogue on to the German-Czech agenda," and spoke in 
favour of the abolishment of the Benes decrees of "lawlessness" 
by which the Sudeten Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia 
(after the Second World War) which "are no longer suitable for 
the European landscape of the end of the 20th century. 
  Stoiber denied using the planned oil pipeline from 
Ingolstadt, Bavaria to the Czech Republic as a means of putting 
political pressure on the Czech Republic. "The pipeline project 
is another sign of our good neighbourliness," he said, adding 
that Czech leaders recognised that Bavaria was not only talking, 
but was also acting in favour of bilateral cooperation. 
  Yesterday, Federal Finance Minister and chairman of 
Bavaria's 
Christian Social Union (CSU) Theo Waigel had also called upon 
the Czech Republic to hold dialogue with Sudeten Germans. 
  Another speaker today was Imrich Kruzliak, introduced as an 
adviser to Slovak President Michal Kovac. "The Sudeten question 
cannot be swept under the carpet because of political 
calculations," he said. 
  The congress, which takes place every year, was attended by 
several tens of thousands of people. The organisers are talking 
about a figure of 100,000. 
  According to information from the Landsmannschaft, 3.8 
million people now declare themselves to be Sudeten Germans, of 
whom 3.4 million live in Germany, 160,000 in Austria and 100,000 
in the Czech Republic. However, in the last census in the 
former Czechoslovakia in 1990, only 50,000 people declared 
themselves to be of German nationality. [passage omitted] 
  The Nuremberg meeting was not attended by official 
representatives of the Czech Republic. Until 1989, in fact, the 
Czechoslovak ambassador used to leave West Germany in protest 
every year for the duration of the congress. In 1990, however, 
the ambassador came to the congress, and in 1991 it was attended 
by a group of Czech parliamentary deputies. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, May 23 (CTK) -- "Mr. President has never and 
nowhere said that the Benes decrees (on the displacement of 
Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War Two) should 
be abolished," Ladislav Spacek, spokesman for Czech President 
Vaclav Havel, told journalists today. 
  He was reacting to the 45th Sudeten German congress held in 
Nuremberg last weekend, at which German Finance Minister and 
chairman of the government Christian Social Union (CSU), Theo 
Waigel, expressed himself for the abolition of the Benes 
decrees. This idea was also supported by Austrian Foreign 
Minister Alois Mock, Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber and 
chairman of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft Franz Neubauer. 
Mock and Neubauer referred to earlier statements by Havel. 
  "President Vaclav Havel declared his resolute stance -- that 
it was impossible to abolish the Benes decrees -- even in his 
statement mentioned" (at the Nuremberg congress), Spacek said. 
He added that quotations of Havel at the congress were 
inaccurate. To prove this, Spacek recalled a statement made by 
Havel during his visit to Austria in March 1993, in which the 
Czech president said: "Given the time interval separating us 
from the issuing of the decrees, my stance towards them is 
critical, but this does not mean that these ancient legal acts 
can be simply annulled or abolished." 
  Spacek said it would be premature to evaluate the Nuremberg 
congress in the nearest days, and therefore Havel could not be 
expected to do so.

  [Text] Prague, May 23 (CTK) -- Premier Vaclav Klaus said 
today he expected German representatives to hear the Czech 
Government's stand on Sudeten Germans "more clearly and 
distinctly" after the autumn parliamentary elections. Speaking 
to CTK after his return from an unofficial visit to the USA, he 
was reacting to the weekend congress of the Sudeten German 
Landsmannschaft. 
  Klaus said that well-known demands were pronounced at the 
congress, which require no "new activities or counter-offensive" 
from the Czech Republic. "I believe that after the German 
elections there will be scope for us to tell our neighbours some 
things more clearly and distinctly. Not (more distinctly) than 
we are saying them now, but than they are heard there (in 
Germany)," Klaus said. 
  At the congress in Nuremberg, the Sudeten Germans again 
called for the abolition of the decrees issued by Czechoslovak 
President Edvard Benes after the war and approved by the Potsdam 
conference of the victorious powers. Under the decrees some 2.5 
Sudeten Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia and their 
property was expropriated. 
  Klaus said that unlike Daniel Kroupa, deputy chairman of the 
coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), he did not think that 
it was up to the Czech Government coalition to take "a 
coalition" stand. 
  Kroupa said at the weekend that he was missing a joint 
coalition stand on the Sudeten German issue and recalled the 
ODA's unsuccessful initiative last year to set up a commission 
to clearly state the coalition's stand. 
  "I don't think that anything of this sort is our task. It is 
not at all a coalition question. We have a Foreign Ministry 
which is functioning normally and which formulates our stand," 
Klaus said.

  [Text] Prague, May 23 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec said today he viewed the fact that two groups of 
demonstrators at the opening of the 45th Sudeten German congress 
unfolded banners reading "No to the Munich Treaty" and "Cheb 
Must Remain Czech" as an important sign of German citizens 
beginning to think a little but about the demands by the Sudeten 
German Landmsannschaft (SL). The congress was held in Nuremberg 
last weekend. Cheb is a west Bohemian district town situated 
near the Czech-German border. 
  "I believe this is a significant moment," Zieleniec told 
journalists. "I hope that German political circles will think so 
as well, since thinking about the future is the basis of mutual 
reconciliation," he added. 
  Zieleniec pointed out that the SL demands were the demands 
for a revision of the results of World War Two, with all 
consequences following from it. In this connection, he warned 
against the danger of an avalanche, "which can extend to very 
unpredictable and distant ends". 
  Zieleniec said he considered the demands voiced at the 
congress for the abolition of the Benes decrees (on the 
displacement of Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after World 
War Two) to be standard demands articulated for long, with 
"differing extents of vehemence" by individual Sudeten German 
politicians. No considerable deviation from this trend was 
recorded at the Sudeten German congress, he added.

  [Text] Prague May 20 (CTK) -- Coalition deputies will not 
support a constitutional bill deleting the Senate from the 
Constitution and introducing a unicameral parliament at the 
parliamentary session opening next Tuesday [24 May], Parliament 
Chairman Milan Uhde said today. The bill has been submitted by 
deputies from opposition Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) 
and the Liberal Social Union (LSU). Three-fifths or 120 votes 
in the 200-seat parliament are necessary for a constitutional 
bill to be passed. The coalition commands 105 votes. 
  Speaking after a meeting of the "coalition thirteen," Uhde 
said that the four coalition parties still held different views 
on Senatorial elections. The coalition thirteen comprises the 
chairman and four deputy chairmen of the parliament, the 
chairmen of the four coalition parties and the chairmen of their 
deputies' groups. 
  The coalition parties are the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), 
the Christian Democratic Party-Czechoslovak People's Party 
(KDU-CSL), the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS). 
  Uhde said that some deputies still believed that the 
Senatorial elections should be one-round, while the government 
bill provides for two-round balloting. A third, compromise bill 
applies the "Australian principle", which combines both previous 
ones, he added. The elections will probably be held in the 
autumn, along with local elections. 
  Another question at issue is the number of constituencies. 
The ODS still rejects any other number than 81, Uhde, an ODS 
member himself, said. But he stressed that negotiations would 
continue "until the last moment" before the session, and may be 
also during the session, which is to deal with the bill. 
Therefore, the course of the session may be slightly dramatic, 
but "dramatic only in brackets because there is will to reach 
agreement," Uhde said. 
  The coalition thirteen today set up a commission to seek a 
solution to the dispute over the size of constituencies for 
elections to the Chamber of Deputies (to be held in 1996) and to 
the Senate. The commission should find a solution as close to 
the original proposal as possible, which would respect the 
existing administrative districts. The original proposal 
provided for about 15 percent differences in the numbers of 
voters in individual constituencies. 
  On May 12, Josef Jezek (formerly ODS, now independent 
deputy), told journalists that in the government-approved bill 
the differences in the population of individual constituencies 
had not been more than 15 percent. But the material distributed 
to the deputies provides for differences of up to 27 percent, he 
added. 
  The commission is headed by Karel Ledvinka (ODA) and 
comprises Libor Novak Jr (ODS), Ivan Masek (ODA), Ludvik Motycka 
(KDU-CSL), Marek Benda (KDS) and government experts. 
  The authenticity of the government bill given to the 
parliament was also doubted today by Deputy Premier and ODA 
Chairman Jan Kalvoda. His statement contradicts an earlier 
claim by Premier Vaclav Klaus who sharply rejected the 
possibility that the parliament would have received another bill 
than that approved by the government.

  [Text] Prague, May 23 (CTK) -- For the first time in the 
past twelve months the popularity of the ODS (Civic Democratic 
Party) dropped under 30 percent, to 29 percent, a poll conducted 
by the Center of the Empiric Researches (STEM) in early May 
revealed. 
  Last May 36 percent of those surveyed would have voted for 
the ODS. On the other hand, the polls of the ODA (Civic 
Democratic Alliance) are steadily increasing from 10 percent a 
year ago to the present 14.8 percent. The ODA is followed by 
the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) with 14.2 percent, and 
the Left Bloc, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) 
and Democratic Left Party (SDL) with a total of 11.5 percent. 
  Parties under the 5-percent limit necessary to get to the 
parliament would receive 4.1 percent (Christian Democratic 
Union- Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL), 4 percent 
(Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party, 
SPR-RSC) and one to two percent (Bohemian and Moravian Center 
Party, Green Party, Christian Democratic Party, and Liberal 
Social Union). 
  The voter turn-out would be 64 percent, while 23 percent 
have 
not made up their mind, and 12 percent are decided not to take 
part, the poll found.

  [Text] Tel Aviv, May 22 (CTK) -- The visit by a delegation 
from the Czech Defence Ministry to Israel has opened up 
possibilities for closer cooperation between the ministries and 
armies of the two countries, and has created a framework for 
specific cooperation between Czech and Israeli companies in 
weapons modernisation, Defence Minister Antonin Baudys said 
today. 
  The five-day visit has seen the signing of an outline 
memorandum on military cooperation. The Czech delegation was 
familiarised with the structure, management and organisation of 
the Israeli army, saw soldiers training and carried on a number 
of negotiations with both state and private military industry 
companies. 
  Baudys said Israel had a very good quality, highly-organised 
and well-trained army, and that Israeli weapons companies were 
offering the Czechs what they needed -- top level technology for 
modernising the weapons and weapons systems used up till now. 
Modernisation programmes would bring new jobs and would later 
allow Czech companies to break into the world market, Baudys 
said. 
  He stressed that no specific agreements had been signed in 
Israel, and that cooperation in the near future would be the 
subject of negotiations between companies. 
  Oskar Sima, director of a military repair company, told CTK 
that one of the very attractive offers which had been made to 
his company was technology for the modernisation of T-72 Soviet 
tanks. An agreement on the supply of the technology was to be 
signed at the end of May, Sima said.

  [Text] Prague, May 23 (CTK) -- Israeli arms manufacturers 
are among serious candidates for cooperation with Czech 
companies in the modernisation of the Czech military technology, 
Defence Minister Antonin Baudys, who returned yesterday from a 
five-day visit to Israel, told CTK today. 
  The Czech Army is facing a complex transformation process 
which involves modernisation of the obsolete military equipment. 
This should be performed by Czech companies cooperating with 
foreign suppliers, Baudys said during a discussion-meeting with 
CTK editors. For this, the Czech companies have sufficient 
potential but they are lacking sophisticated know-how which is 
being offered by Israel, he added. 
  The Israeli army has rich experience with modernising the 
Soviet-made weapons and weapons systems of which it gained a 
considerable amount after the Arab-Israeli 1967 Six-Day War, 
Baudys said. 
  The Israeli companies are offering top-quality technology 
for 
modernising the Slovak-made T-72 tanks, MiG aircraft, missile 
systems and sophisticated ammunition. 
  The individual companies will make the final decision after 
the Defence Ministry presents concrete orders, said Baudys, 
adding that the projects of modernisation of the Czech Army 
would be completed by the end of June. 
  The visit of the Czech Defence Ministry delegation to Israel 
during which the two countries signed an outline memorandum on 
military cooperation paved the way for cooperation in the 
military sphere, Baudys said. Israel considers the Czech 
Republic a reliable and trustworthy partner which is evidenced 
by the fact that cooperation in such a delicate sphere as 
military technology usable for civilian purposes as well was 
supported by the Israeli Defence Ministry and Yitzhak Rabin, 
Israeli premier and defence minister, Baudys stated.

  "The Foreign Ministry welcomes and supports the efforts made 
by the sides concerned, primarily Ukraine, to settle the debate

  [Text] Budapest, 25 May (MTI) -- If the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ) form a governing coalition after second round voting on 
May 29, they will agree in detail on implementing a joint 
programme, and disclose it to the last letter, a TV debate with 
MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn and SZDSZ prime minister candidate 
Gabor Kuncze on Hungarian Television clarified this morning. 
Apart from an interview from his hospital bed, Horn was on the 
screen for the first time since his May 5 car crash. 
  Horn judged that from their manifestos and efforts, both 
parties have realistic chances and show the will to govern 
together. 
  In Kuncze's view, the situation will be different depending 
on whether the MSZP wins more or less than 50 percent of seats 
in the second round. If more, the Socialists will not have to 
coordinate policies with their coalition partner, the SZDSZ 
leader said. Although Kuncze did not rule out cooperation in 
this case, he said joining such a coalition would need an SZDSZ 
delegate assembly decision. 
  Horn said the MSZP would pursue the same policies whether it 
wins 48 or 52 percent. "A government which is unable to agree 
not only with its coalition partner but also with other parties, 
will be short-lived because the problems the country faces can 
only be tackled with a national consensus," Horn said. 
  The two politicians dismissed as a rumour speculation on a 
behind-the-scenes agreement which would give the prime 
minister's post to Horn, and the deputy prime minister's 
portfolios to the Socialists' top economic politician Laszlo 
Bekesi, as well as to Gabor Kuncze and Gabor Fodor of the Free 
Democrats. Horn denied even more flatly that trade union leader 
Sandor Nagy's name had been raised as prime minister candidate. 
  On the nomination of Miklos Nemeth, prime minister from 1988 
to 1990 and EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development] vice-president today, Horn said, "last May the MSZP 
offered him the prime minister's post if there was a Socialist 
victory. At that time, Nemeth declined the offer. Although the 
Socialists welcome Nemeth at any time, things have changed since 
then, as the MSZP waged a tough electoral struggle, using a 
great deal of human energy, without the one-time prime minister."

  [Text] Budapest, 20 May (MTI) -- Coalition or a one-party 
government is what is at issue on May 29, round two of national 
elections, Gabor Kuncze, prime minister candidate of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), said in Pecs, southern 
Hungary, today. 
  For the Free Democrats, it will decide if they enjoy enough 
support to implement their programme, he said. 
  Should the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) win an outright 
majority in parliament, there are minimal chances of a 
MSZP-SZDSZ coalition being formed, Kuncze said, adding that a 
final decision would be up to the SZDSZ delegates' assembly on 
June 5. 
  If the Socialists won more than 50 percent of mandates, the 
SZDSZ would have no genuine weight in any coalition, Kuncze told 
MTI, saying the Free Democrats are not willing to be coalition 
"extras". 
  If the MSZP won less than 50 percent and the SZDSZ won about 
25 per cent of mandates, the Free Democrats could have a genuine 
influence on government, Kuncze said.

  [Text] Budapest, 20 May (MTI) -- Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen 
County police are conducting proceedings against Istvan Mosolygo 
-- the driver of the car that crashed while carrying Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP) Chairman Gyula Horn from an election 
rally in Miskolc -- for having allegedly caused a road accident 
by careless driving, says a statement issued by the National 
Police Command (ORFK) simultaneous to its Friday [20 May] press 
conference. 
  According to the police briefing, the Saab-9000 driven by 
Mosolygo, en route from Miskolc to Budapest, crossed the 
bisecting line of the road and hit an IFA-type lorry, which was 
parked in the opposite lane because of a defect in the trailer's 
right rear tyre. The accident occurred on May 5 at 8.45 P.M. 
[1845 GMT] on highway No. 3 between Nyekladhaza and Emod. 
Mosolygo, Horn, and his escort, retired police-major Jeno 
Zsidey, sustained serious injuries in the accident. According 
to investigations so far, neither Mosolygo nor the lorry-driver 
were intoxicated. 
  The police survey of the scene of the accident showed that 
the lorry stood on the left side of the road, 0.7-1.2 meters 
from the bisecting line. The passengers in the Saab observed no 
oncoming traffic, nor did they see any pedestrians, cyclists, or 
animals nearby, and only Zsidey claimed to have seen a sudden 
flash of light. Mosolygo cannot remember what happened before 
or during the crash. 
  There was no witness to raise suspicion that the crash had 
been caused deliberately, the National Police Command told 
reporters at the press conference called in Budapest on Friday 
after investigations into the accident came to an end. 
  In response to questions from reporters, the National Police 
Commissioner, Brigadier-General Sandor Pinter, said that on 
March 25 the ORFK had offered personal escorts to all eight 
parliamentary parties, but none availed themselves of the 
opportunity. He made it a point to stress that the car carrying 
the person under police escort never goes ahead, as was the case 
with the convoy of three cars accompanying Horn on his return 
from Miskolc. 
  Prior to the accident, Horn received several threatening 
telephone calls, and police patrols had been assigned to 
regularly check the vicinity of the MSZP chairman's residence, 
Pinter said.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 24 -- President Lech Walesa is setting 
off for a three-day visit to Switzerland on Wednesday, at the 
invitation of Swiss President Otto Stich on behalf of the 
Federal Council of the Swiss Confederation. 
  Switzerland plays host only once a year to an official 
visitor from a foreign state. Poland is the first country in 
Central and Eastern Europe to have received an invitation for 
such a visit. 
  President Walesa will head a delegation including Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski, head of the president's chancellery 
Janusz Ziolkowski, National Bank of Poland President Hanna 
Gronkiewicz-Waltz and Deputy Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak. 
  Lech Walesa will also be accompanied by 15 representatives 
of 
Polish business since the visit is intended to strengthen 
Polish- Swiss economic ties. At the moment Switzerland is in 
13th place in the league of Poland's trading partners, and 234 
Swiss firms operate in Poland with a small capital of 170 
million dollars. 
  The last significant Polish-Swiss business deal was the 
purchase of the Poznan firm "Goplana" by Nestle. 
  No trade agreements are intended to be signed but several 
meetings are planned which should bear fruit later on. Among 
these is a "round table" meeting planned with representatives of 
Swiss economic circles which will be chaired by the presidents 
of both countries. 
  The Polish delegation has plans to visit four Swiss cantons 
-- Berne, Zurich, St. Gallen and Solure (which is represented by 
the Swiss president). President Walesa is to meet 
representatives of the thousands-strong Polish community. 
  This will be Walesa's first visit to Switzerland in his 
capacity as Polish president. But in June 1981 as leader of 
Solidarity he headed a delegation to the International Labour 
Organisation in Geneva. 
  Bronislaw Geremek, who is now one of the leaders of the 
Freedom Union, accompanied him at the time. Several meetings 
took place then. This was one of the elements of the "existence 
of Poland in the world up to the achieving of independence," 
presidential press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 24 -- Defence Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk on Tuesday denied the report by the 
"SLOWO-DZIENNIK KATOLICKI" Catholic daily alleging that he plans 
to resign over misunderstandings with President Lech Walesa. In 
his opinion, the news items have nothing to do with reality, are 
"outrageous and directed against the state's interests." 
  Kolodziejczyk added that this is not the first time when 
such 
a thing happens prior to his important foreign visits. He 
recalled his meeting with the German minister of defence. Now, 
Kolodziejczyk is going to leave for Brussels to meet NATO 
defence ministers and talk with the U.S. secretary of defence 
and the Baltic states' defence ministers.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 24 -- After a twelve-minute long session 
attended by President Lech Walesa, the cabinet Tuesday decided 
to approve of his proposal and pass on a document outlining 
major changes in the organization of the Polish Armed Forces to 
the National Defence Committee (KOK). 
  Walesa told reporters after the session that he had asked 
the 
prime minister and the cabinet to transfer discussion on topics 
that "are very important and must not breed conflicts between 
us" to the KOK forum. 
  The president also described the topics contained in the 
document, drafted by the National Defence Ministry, as delicate 
and requiring in-depth discussion. 
  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak noted that KOK members 
include 
the Sejm and Senate speakers, along top representatives of the 
executive branch. 
  According to Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the 
document was very mature and there was no need for changes in 
it. He also said that the document concerned very important 
matters and its final elaboration should not be done under the 
pressure of time. Kolodziejczyk acknowledged the right of the 
KOK to deal with the matter. 
  The document provides for the establishment of command 
centres for the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. The joint 
commander of all three kinds of Armed Forces would report to the 
minister of defence. An earlier version of the proposal 
envisaged that he would report directly to the president.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 20 -- Deputy Defence minister 
responsible for parliamentary affairs Danuta Waniek said in an 
exclusive interview for PAP on Friday that she plans to give a 
"new shape" to the relations between the ministry and the Sejm 
and Senate. 
  She is going to establish a parliamentary office within the 
ministry that will draft laws necessary for the restructuring of 
the Polish Army. Waniek said she had already submitted her 
conception which is now being examined by the general staff. 
  Asked about the possibility to increase the role of women in 
the army, Waniek expressed the opinion that as soon as the 
Polish defence is built on professional army, the army will open 
to women in line with the constitutional principle of equal 
rights, "like in the United States," she said. 
  Referring to the question of civilian control over the army, 
Mrs. Waniek said that the control is in the hand of "the one who 
decides about the money," that is, the Sejm. Waniek also 
stressed that she did not suspend her membership in the Social 
Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SDRP). "Let the people 
know whom they have to do with" she said.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 21 -- The National Council of the 
Freedom Union (UW) Saturday adopted a statement warning against 
centralistic tendencies in the policy of the present government. 
The statement says that the government wants to "fully control 
the state, offices, banks and supervisory boards of state 
enterprises" by filling important posts with members of the 
ruling coalition parties. "The Freedom Union comes out against 
this policy" and will support the development of 
self-governments, reads the document. 
  In his address to the council members, Party leader Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki also pointed to a growing threat from the government 
and the president to independent institutions of a democratic 
state, such as the National Radio and Television Council. 
  After a heated debate, the UW Council appointed 11 persons 
to 
the newly created posts of national secretaries of the party. 
Their task will be to monitor government policies in important 
areas of economy and public life and react to government 
decisions. Leaders of the party denied the new posts were 
modelled after the shadow cabinet in the British system of 
government, an opinion prevailing in the press recently. 
  Among the 11 secretaries are Jerzy Osiatynski (in charge of 
economic policy), Wojciech Arkuszewski (economic system), Piotr 
Nowina-Konopka (foreign affairs), Michal Boni (social policy), 
Bogdan Borusewicz (public security).

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 24/5/1994 -- Romanian Defense 
Minister Gheorghe Tinca states in an interview granted to the 
Bucharest daily CRONICA ROMANA that an East-West alternative, or 
a Russians-NATO alternative, "is a totally artificial problem if 
we take into consideration Romania's interests under the current 
historical circumstances". 
  "It would be much better for us to give up arguing on this 
artificial problem and to concentrate on our national 
interests," the Romanian minister adds. 
  Showing that taking what is best from one side or another 
"does not mean however that we have deceived one side or the 
other or that we were hostile to one side or thrown into the 
arms of another," Gheorghe Tinca states in the mentioned 
interview: "I am militating exclusively for our national 
interests and we must find out how we can better serve these 
interests. Two are the fundamental criteria: performance and 
cost. That is why I think that we should foster ties with the 
entire world, benefiting on all planes, but especially as 
regards technical progress". 
  As for the budget allotted to defense, the Romanian minister 
views it as enough as regards preservation of the country's 
defense capacities. "I am glad that special attention was given 
to social aspects, such as housing the militaries, where we are 
facing major problems. As for Army equipment with top military 
technique, even if we had three-times the budget of the country, 
it wouldn't have been enough for gaining that sophisticated 
weaponry that we are all dreaming of, for which many years are 
to pass and even huge expenses to be made". 
  "The issues confronting the Romanian Army, the real ones 
regarding reform, modernization, qualitative changes are only 
beginning and are implying a long and thorough process," 
Gheorghe Tinca concluded.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/5/1994 -- After concluding 
his visits to Brazil, Peru and Paraguay (over 10-22 May), 
Romania's Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and those who 
accompanied him on his tour made a review on the positive 
results of the visits. 
  Stressing on the fact that his visits "have marked a 
relaunch 
of bilateral ties with the three states," Nicolae Vacaroiu 
mentioned that several agreements and firm contracts worth $80 
million have been concluded, to which the contract-framework 
accounting for $800 million is added with real possibilities for 
rapid capitalization. 
  "The tour has brought to the fore an extensive potential of 
growing Romanian exports," Minister of Industries Dumitru 
Popescu commented, "and this because the area is rich in raw 
materials and we must operate exports to get them. An example 
is Brazil with which we have set ourselves to reach a volume of 
trade worth some $70 million, half of which being expected to 
represent Romanian exports. We are to focus on car, metal and 
chemical products and equipment exports." 
  Minister of Trade Cristian Ionescu stated in his turn that 
prospects are in place for relaunching Romanian commercial 
exchanges with the three states, especially with Brazil: "The 
fact that our Brazilian partners have shown special interest in 
growing ties with Romania is an extremely encouraging fact for 
us. Obviously, ties will also grow with Peru and Paraguay". 
  According to Education Minister Liviu Maior, conditions are 
in place "to send student researchers in Latin America, as well 
as prospects to open lectorships of Romanian language and 
civilization in three major universities. As for culture, there 
is a high demand for Romanian exhibitions, first of all of 
Brancusi works, as well as for tours of musical groups, 
especially for the Madrigal Choir. Moreover, we were asked to 
promote a tighter collaboration in the field of Romance studies". 
  As for the political-diplomatic field, Foreign Ministry 
State 
Secretary Marcel Dinu stated that "we are collecting the results 
after promoting a constant policy of close ties with Latin 
American countries, which is one of our main priorities. 
Certainly some could raise the question if these visits were 
put under the sign of integration in Europe. I view these 
priorities as complementary, and by no means one is excluding 
the other."

  [Text] Bratislava, May 21 (CTK) -- The opposition Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) intends to lodge a complaint 
with parliament, the Council of Europe and foreign human rights 
organizations, concerning of the rejection of a petition drive 
launched by the HZDS earlier this year and aimed at organizing 
the first referendum in the country. This follows from a 
session of the HZDS National Board held in Nimnica u Puchova, 
west Slovakia, today. 
  The petition drive for the referendum, through which the 
HZDS 
wanted to solve the questions of the early elections, the 
withdrawal of mandates from "disobedient deputies," and the 
"purity" of money involved in privatization, was rejected in 
mid-March by the Presidential Office, which argued that the 
constitutional condition of gaining at least 350,000 petition 
signatures which enable the president to launch the referendum, 
had not been met. Signatures started to be collected in late 
February, and on March 2 the petition committee handed to the 
Presidential Office lists with 422,054 signatures. However, 
after their verification only 232,957 were recognized as valid. 
  HZDS representatives said today that the party experts had 
re- examined the lists and stated that more that 372,000 
signatures were valid, it means more than required by the 
Constitution. HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar insisted that his 
former collaborator and current adversary, President Michal 
Kovac, had breached his constitutional duty to call the 
referendum. 
  Referring to the HZDS pre-election strategy, Meciar said it 
was correct for its former partner in the government coalition, 
the Slovak National Party (SNS), to enter the autumn 
parliamentary elections separately. Nevertheless, the HZDS 
counts on post-election cooperation with the SNS, he added. 
  Polls show that the HZDS and the SNS could gain more votes 
if 
entering the elections separately. But while the HZDS's 
popularity among Slovak citizens is 27-32 per cent, the SNS has 
less than five per cent of followers.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 24 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal 
Kovac's Office today described ex-premier Vladimir Meciar's 
allegation that the head of state violated his constitutional 
duty and civil rights by refusing to call a referendum as a 
distortion of the facts. 
  Meciar made the claim last Saturday [21 May] that in early 
March Kovac refused to call a referendum on early elections and 
on the abolition of the mandates of "turncoat" deputies and on 
the origin of the money used in privatization although more than 
350.000 signatures required by the constitution were collected 
on the petition for a referendum. Meciar's Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) intends to lodge a complaint in 
parliament, the Council of European and at international human 
rights organizations. 
  "The intention to submit the fabricated affair to 
international organization could only be aimed at casting doubt 
about Slovak Republic being a democratic country if its 
president allegedly violated the constitution. The HZDS 
leadership has placed its partial interests above the interests 
of the republics and its good name abroad," says a statement 
issued by the Presidential Office and given to CTK today. 
  The statement points out that because of the lack of some 
data on the petition lists, required by the law, the number of 
valid signatures decreased to less than 325,000, less than 
legally required for a referendum. The statement says that the 
petition rolls are still at everybody's disposal to check the 
correctness of the Presidential Office's decision. 
  These facts confirm that the president could not call a 
referendum and that he did not violate the constitution. On the 
contrary, by calling a referendum he would have violated the 
constitution, which the president would not do, the statement 
says.

  [Text] Bratislava May 24 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
today approved the Slovak Republic's Defence Doctrine. "The 
doctrine puts emphasis on the closer relations with and later 
membership of West European and Transatlantic security 
structures," Defence Minister Pavol Kanis told Slovak Radio. He 
said the document would be valid until the time when Slovakia 
joins Western structures and assumes their doctrine. 
  The initial draft doctrine was approved in March by the 
cabinet of ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar but then the doctrine was 
reworked on the basis of remarks raised by the parliamentary 
committee. The document setting the goals and principles of 
Slovakia's security policy is to be valid for a time of 
Slovakia's participation in the Partnership for Peace project. 
  "The Slovak Republic actually has the weakest potential of 
the armed forces, the weakest economic and human potential and 
it is therefore a pre-condition for the success of our defence 
to join a system of collective security. Our successful foreign 
policy is becoming a guarantee of our security," he said. 
  At its session today, the government also discussed a 
presentation document to serve as a basic material for drafting 
an individual programme of Slovakia's cooperation with the North 
Atlantic Alliance within the Partnership for Peace project. 
Kanis said that on the basis of the defence doctrine and the 
presentation document the concrete defence and security policy 
will be implemented by the end of the century. 
  The presentation document will be submitted to a NATO 
Council 
meeting in Brussels by Kanis on Wednesday [25 April]. The 
political document on the Slovak Republic's joining the 
Partnership for Peace project was signed this February in 
Brussels by ex-Premier Meciar.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- The United States is 
not interested in drawing "new dividing lines" in Europe but if 
there are complications in the developments of Eastern Europe, 
Slovakia will become part of West European security structures, 
Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis told reporters on his return 
from the United States. 
  "The key question is how Ukraine now develops: whether it 
will become federalized or draw closer to the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS)," Kanis said. 
  Commenting on NATO's offer of special status to Russia in 
the 
Partnership for Peace program, allowing it consultation on 
European security issues, he said, "Russia as a Eurasian nuclear 
superpower cannot have the same status as the other countries." 
  Slovakia will submit a presentation document -- providing 
the 
basis for an individual program of cooperation with NATO -- on 
May 25 at a session of the North Atlantic Council for 
Cooperation in Brussels. The document has first to be approved 
by the Slovak government on Tuesday, along with the new national 
defense doctrine. 
  Kanis said the United States had appreciated the fact that 
the document had been prepared through broad consultation. The 
Slovak side, he said, had had consultations in Washington, in 
Garmisch- Partenkirchen at the Marshall Institute and also with 
German Defense Minister Volker Ruhe. 
  Kanis said it was symbolic that the government would debate 
the presentation document and the new defense doctrine at the 
same time. The previous cabinet, headed by Vladimir Meciar, 
approved the Slovak defense doctrine at the beginning of the 
year. The decision to prepare a new doctrine was taken, Kanis 
said, so that those who did not agree with opinions of former 
Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak could also contribute.

  [Text] Bratislava May 20 (CTK) -- If the Stability Pact 
guarantees existing borders, space will be created for the 
inclusion of this document in a Slovak-Hungarian basic treaty, 
Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik said today. 
  The conclusion of the Stability Pact between the European 
Union (EU) and Central and East European countries is primarily 
aimed at solving ethnic minority problems as well as the border 
issues between some states, he said. He said that though the 
current working shape of the document is acceptable to Slovakia, 
certain changes could be expected at the Paris conference 
scheduled for next week as some states voiced certain 
reservations against it. 
  "The inclusion of the passage on the inviolability of the 
existing Slovak-Hungarian border in the basic treaty was 
proposed by Slovakia," Moravcik said. He said that Slovak 
diplomats proceeded from the fact that during the discussion on 
a similar treaty with Ukraine certain reservations were raised. 
  The guarantees for the joint border, about which the 
Hungarian side is "reserved", is a sensitive problem for 
Slovakia. "We have to unambiguously and consistently reject the 
fear of irredentism in Slovakia," he said, adding that the 
guarantee of borders have been and are part of international 
documents. 
  "We have come to believe that EU participation in the 
formulation of a Slovak-Hungarian treaty would not necessarily 
to bring positive results," Moravcik said asked why Slovakia 
refused to conclude a treaty with Hungary under EU supervision. 
"There is no reason for such treaties to be agreed upon under 
the auspices of third countries," he added. 
  He pointed out, however, that the Stability Pact could 
provide necessary guarantees for its member states and create 
the necessary conditions for the "gradual integration" of nine 
Central and East European countries into the EU.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- Minority 
representatives from Central and East European countries "must 
unconditionally" take part in the stability pact talks aimed at 
settling questions concerning postcommunist countries, Hungarian 
minority representative Miklos Duray told CTK today. Duray is 
chairman of Egyutteles, a Hungarian minority party which is part 
of the Slovak Government coalition. 
  Egyutteles would not seek participation at the starting 
conference to be held next week in Paris but would like to enter 
into discussions as part of the process already under way, he 
said, adding that Egyutteles had been lobbying for the idea in 
Slovakia and Hungary as well as in other European countries.

  [Text] Bratislava May 20 (CTK) -- Slovakia must make use 
of the "big" money it put into nuclear energy production, 
Premier Jozef Moravcik declared today. He said that the only 
possibility of doing this and at the same time respecting the 
opinion of neighbouring countries was to concentrate on the 
safety of nuclear power plant operations. "The project for 
completing the nuclear power plant in Mochovce, West Slovakia, 
is safer than the European average," Moravcik said. 
  Cooperation with France provides the possibility for 
securing 
Slovakia's basic interests in the energy producing sector and 
completing the Mochovce plant in a manner that would "serve as 
an example" of a safe solution, Moravcik added. 
  He stressed that the participation of the French and banking 
institutions in the Mochovce plant's completion was subject to 
the condition that operations would be stopped in the first 
reactor of another Slovak nuclear power plant located in 
Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia. "The government has accepted 
the obligation," Moravcik stressed.

  [Text] Bratislava May 20 (CTK) -- The abolition of the 
lustration (screening) law cannot be considered because there is 
not enough political will for it, Premier Jozef Moravcik told 
journalists today. However, its amendment, which is being 
prepared, should be used to rectify the "wrongdoings" and put it 
in harmony with the principles of the law-abiding state, he 
added. 
  The lustration law, which was passed by the now-defunct 
Czechoslovak federal parliament in 1991 and taken over by the 
two successor states, the Czech and Slovak Republics after 
Czechoslovakia's division in 1993, bars former Communist Party 
officials, StB (secret police) agents and collaborators and 
People's Militia members from high economic and political posts 
until 1996. 
  The lustration problem reappeared in Slovakia after Moravcik 
had asked the Slovak Information Service (SIS) to issue 
lustration certificates for the members of his cabinet. The SIS 
was empowered to conduct lustrations under a resolution by 
former Meciar's cabinet whose validity expired in January. 
  According to Moravcik, Meciar's government did not create 
conditions for anybody to make the lustrations. "Worse still, 
there were 'wild' lustrations," he stressed. No one asked for 
them officially, but their result was taken into account in the 
decision- making which contradicted the spirit of the law 
codifying the protection of the personality, he added. "It is 
not possible to deal with information from the archives 
otherwise than as laid down by the law," Moravcik concluded.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, May 20 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
The Slovak Information Service (SIS) cannot be entrusted with 
the issue of screening (lustration) certificates because it is 
not an organ of the state administration, but of the Slovak 
Republic, former chairman of the Czechoslovak Constitutional 
Court Ernest Valko says in an interview in SME. 
  All the members of Moravcik's new government are at present 
undergoing the screening required by law to see if they 
collaborated with the communist secret police. However, the 
process is being held up because it is not clear who should 
issue the certificates, Moravcik said recently. 
  Under the former federation, screening certificates were 
issued by the Federal Interior Ministry, and "from the 
constitutional law on the demise of the federation it follows 
that the relevant organ for the issue of screening certificates 
is the Slovak Interior Ministry," Valko says. 
  In March 1993 the government of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar 
entrusted the SIS with issuing screening certificates for a 
period of nine months. After this the question of the competent 
body was to be dealt with by legislation, but this never 
happened. The present government, according to its statements, 
intends to solve the problem by amending the law on the SIS and 
the screening law, which bans secret police collaborators from 
holding high office. 
  "I find it very difficult to understand how, in a government 
which included a professor of administrative law (Katharina 
Tothova) and where the government decree was conceived by 
legislators, such a misunderstanding could have occurred," Valko 
said.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- The chairmen of four 
left- oriented Slovak groupings -- the Democratic Left Party 
(SDL), the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia (SDSS), the 
Farmers' Movement (HZ) and the Green Party in Slovakia (SZS) -- 
today signed an agreement on election and post-election 
cooperation. 
  "The coalition will strive to win the elections. It 
represents a chance for Slovakia," SDL Chairman Peter Weiss said 
after the signing of the document. Leaders of the three 
remaining parties, Jaroslav Volf, Jozef Klein and Jozef Pokorny 
backed Weiss's view, saying they believed that their election 
grouping was the most acceptable for Slovak voters. 
  Under the agreement, the new coalition will share places on 
the lists of candidates in the ratio 24-6-5-3 
(SDL-SZS-SDSS-Farmers' Movement), which, according to Weiss, 
corresponds to the results of both pre-election polls and the 
latest, June 1992 elections. 
  The left-wing coalition wants to form a broader social 
democratic stream on the Slovak political scene, the policy of 
which would ensue from left-oriented traditions and "the green 
philosophy." The coalition also wants to try to gain 
international support, mainly from the Socialist International 
member parties and the Party of European Socialists. 
  Polls show that the left-wing coalition now can count on 
15-23 per cent of the vote in the elections slated for the 
autumn. According to latest popularity ratings, the coalition 
has been gaining upon the preferences of the opposition Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) of Slovak ex-premier Vladimir 
Meciar.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 21 (CTK) -- The Green Party in 
Slovakia (SZS) will enter the autumn parliamentary elections 
within the left- wing coalition, SZS Chairman Jozef Pokorny told 
journalists during the session of his party's coordination 
committee today. 
  "On Monday [23 May] we will sign a coalition agreement with 
the Democratic Left Party (SDL), the Social Democratic Party in 
Slovakia (SDSS), and the Farmers' Movement," Pokorny announced. 
  Under the coalition agreement, the order of candidates on 
the 
list of candidates is to ensure the SZS six deputies' seats (in 
the 150-seat Slovak parliament), provided the coalition acquires 
the expected 15 per cent of vote. The SZS will propose a total 
of 34 candidates. The agreement will enable the SZS to create 
its own deputies' group in parliament, to promote their program, 
and veto stances of the coalition, Pokorny said. 
  He said that if his party entered the elections separately 
and received five per cent of votes, it could gain seven 
parliamentary seats. But it may fail to enter parliament if not 
part of the coalition. 
  Pokorny said that three former SZS members, who would have 
preferred a SZS coalition with the opposition Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), were founding the Slovak Green 
Party, adding he believed that this step aimed to weaken the SZS 
before the elections. However, the SZS coalition with the 
left-wing forces has annoyed only a few individuals of the 
1,500-2,000 members of the party. 
  Pokorny informed journalists that the SZS intended to 
establish a foundation to finance the conversion of the 
unfinished nuclear power station in Mochovce, west Slovakia, to 
vapor- and gas power.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- The recently emerged 
bloc of the Democratic Party (DS) and the Party of Slovak 
Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople (SPZ) has asked the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH) to form an "equal" coalition so that 
not a single right-wing vote is lost in the autumn elections, 
the two parties' chairmen announced today. 
  This call for coalition talks, which will be held on 
Saturday 
[28 May], actually means a refusal of the KDH offer which opened 
its list of candidates to politicians from small right-wing 
parties. Electoral polls have shown that only the KDH of the 
fragmented Slovak right could cross the five-per-cent barrier in 
the elections scheduled for September 30-October 1. The KDH has 
been refusing the right-wing coalition. 
  "We shall try to form a united coalition of the 
right-of-the- 
centre parties," DS chairman Pavol Hagyari stated. He said he 
could not rule out that the DS-SPZ bloc would enter the 
elections independently, probably as one legal entity for which 
5 per cent are sufficient, not seven as in case of a coalition. 
  However, SPZ chairman Vladimir Randa called the cooperation 
a 
"pre- and post-electoral bloc of two independent parties." The 
Slovak right must make up its mind by the end of July when the 
list of candidates must be submitted.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- The Christian Democrats 
(KDH) will answer the invitation of two smaller parties, the 
Democratic Party (DS) and the Party of Entrepreneurs and 
Tradespeople (SPZ) to form an electoral coalition at Wednesday's 
meeting of right-wing parties, KDH chairman Jan Carnogursky told 
CTK today. 
  "We do not yet have a special standpoint on this invitation. 
We are still maintaining our offer of open candidate sheets," 
Carnogursky said. He confirmed that rather than form an 
electoral coalition, the KDH preferred to continue offering 
places on its candidate lists to politicians from the smaller 
right-wing parties. 
  The KDH's offer has as yet been accepted only by politicians 
known from the days of the Czechoslovak federation, headed by 
ex- Minister of the Interior Jan Langos. While the Slovak left 
today officially entered into a coalition, the other side of the 
political spectrum is still unclear. According to pre-electoral 
polls, only the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the 
left-wing coalition and the KDH are sure of gaining the five per 
cent of votes needed to enter parliament. 
  In the 1992 elections the Slovak right was not able to 
overcome its fragmented nature. The method in which the 
right-wing parties will enter the autumn elections has to be 
decided before the candidate lists close in July.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- Election polls have 
indicated that three stable preelection political blocs -- 
ethnic Hungarian, left-wing and national -- exist in Slovakia, 
today's tabloid NOVY CAS says. 
  The Democratic Left Party (SDL) has distinguished itself by 
a 
stable organizational structure which made it possible to easily 
form a strong bloc. This will include the Slovak Green Party, 
the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia (SSDZ) and the Farmers' 
Movement, the daily reports, adding that "this is simply a 
professional political matter with a minimum risk." 
  The Hungarian bloc is united by the idea of national demands 
and fear of Vladimir Meciar's return to power. This fact may be 
reflected in greater parliamentary representation of the ethnic 
Hungarian parties than two years ago, the paper states. 
  The national bloc may be the most complicated, but its 
popularity is the highest, the paper notes. In addition to the 
HZDS (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia), it assembles the 
Slovak Farmers' Party and the nationally-orientated Slovak 
National Party (SNS) and possibly the Christian Social Union 
(KSU), the daily says. 
  The HZDS is stabilized not only with respect to popularity, 
but also by its desire to regain power. However, the SNS is 
searching not only for its identity, but also for an internal 
foe. "It cannot offer the voter anything but a picture of the 
domestic and external foes of Slovakia," the paper says, adding 
that this tension in the national bloc cannot lead to 
undervaluing its "force in the struggle for posts and seats in 
the parliament," the paper notes. 
  The bloc of the "noncollectivist" parties is united by the 
struggle against Meciar and by an effort to remain in government 
even after the elections, "but it is divided over how to achieve 
the objective." This has resulted in its division into the 
centrist bloc (the Democratic Union, National Democratic 
Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA), the bloc of the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH) and the Permanent Conference of the 
Civic Institute, and finally the bloc of the Democratic Party 
(DS) and the Party of Slovak Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople 
(SZP), the paper reports. 
  The elections are "in the offing," but the answer to the 
question of how the mentioned right-of-the-center parties will 
convince most voters about the force of their noncollectivist 
policy within a short time is still unknown, the paper notes. 
  The Slovak right fared badly in the latest Federal 
(Czechoslovak) June 1992 elections -- apart from the KDH no 
party of this side of the spectrum got into parliament, the 
left-wing PRAVDA says. 
  The paper points to DS Chairman Pavol Hagyari's effort "to 
unite on the right everything which can be united" in order to 
prevent the 1992 situation from being repeated. However, "the 
result of this effort does not correspond to the exerted 
effort," the paper notes. The DS, which has come into life by 
gradual merging of the right- wing parties, has not crossed in 
May the five-per-cent limit necessary for getting into 
parliament, the paper adds. 
  The KDH offer of an "open list of candidates" implies one 
seat for the DS in every constituency. "If they accept the 
offer, a loss of face is looming, if they do not, they can lose 
themselves because the failure in elections will make them 
politically marginal figures," the paper notes. 
  The ostensibly accommodating KDH offer to the right-wing 
parties would actually result in "their virtual demise," the 
independent NARODNA OBRODA comments on the issue. 
  Along with the SSPZ the DS showed at the past weekend a 
different way to uniting the right: They formed a joint 
electoral bloc, the daily reports. This has one advantage -- it 
maintains the identity of the political parties, at the same 
time showing who and what structure is entering it, the paper 
adds. 
  The KDH on the one hand, and the DS with the SZP on the 
other, have presented two strategies paving the way for a single 
objective -- taking advantage of every right-wing vote, the 
paper notes. 
  "Hagyari has evidently forgotten the situation of two years 
ago when the Slovak right was routed," SLOVENSKY DENNIK, close 
to the KDH, says. The DS has entered the electoral competition 
with a bold statement that the DS-SZP bloc has almost opened its 
way to the parliament, the paper adds. 
  "This is a fatal error at the expense of all Slovakia which 
even now will not be able to abandon the way of state 
paternationalism (combination of paternalism and nationalism), 
bureaucracy, and leftist fairy-tales," the paper concludes.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandur Strezov: "How About Upper </F>
Vardar?"] 
  [Text] According to a report in the Greek daily TA NEA, 
President Clinton is said to personally support the idea 
proposed by U.S. Ambassador in Athens Thomas Niles to call 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
Northern Macedonia. It would be interesting to know how this 
wise suggestion came about. Perhaps it is based on the 
comparatively harmless example of North Carolina or North 
Dakota, but an analogy may also be sought with North Vietnam, 
North Korea, Northern Cyprus, or North Yemen -- all countries 
that are artificially divided. It is not so difficult to 
predict the Greek reaction to this proposal, which in principle 
suits Skopje's theses and adds fuel to the flames that have 
flared up around the name of the new republic. However, this 
does not at all mean that Kiro Gligorov and his comrades-in-arms 
will accept the U.S. proposal, despite the fact that they could 
not wish for more -- Bulgarian Macedonia is already part of the 
republic, while the Greek part looks as if it is simply 
artificially separated from the small homeland. 
  It will be interesting to see if there is any official 
Bulgarian reaction to the name of "Northern Macedonia," which in 
principle also includes eastern Macedonia -- in other words, the 
Blagoevgrad region. Skopje's appetite for our lands and the "2 
million" Macedonians in Bulgaria is no secret to anyone. To 
prevent this, at least in words, one should ask for Macedonia to 
be called "Northwest Macedonia," or again, if we follow the 
trends in the world, we should ask for the name of "Vardar 
Macedonia" to be adopted. However, because the Vardar River also 
flows further to the south, perhaps it would be more accurate to 
use the name of "Upper Vardar Macedonia." However, everyone 
knows that the Greeks do not want the name of Macedonia 
mentioned at all. In this case, nothing remains but to call the 
country "Upper Vardar," something like Upper Volta. 
  All this may well sound like mockery, but it is interesting 
how people from across the ocean find the courage to attempt to 
impose their way of thinking, without even taking the trouble to 
familiarize themselves with the historical tangle surrounding 
the Macedonian question. According to political circles in 
Washington, the package of measures proposed, with the addition 
of the new name, is the best solution, and Athens should accept 
it. Athens will state its view on this, despite Washington's 
optimism, but will Sofia say something too?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Konstantin Subchev: "A Bosnia in the </F>
Rhodopes?"] 
  [Text] However much the DPS [Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms] as a whole wants to win for itself the humble image of 
an all-national centrist party, its leaders, through their 
incautious revelations, are doing everything possible to 
frustrate these intentions. This time, Osman Oktay let out in 
Momchilgrad that the DPS should also seize the economic power in 
the region by appointing its own people as directors of the 
state enterprises. 
  Accusations of separatism have been poured out against the 
DPS for a long time now. In the beginning, they came from the 
extreme nationalists and certain BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] 
leaders, so no one believed them. For too long Bulgarian 
society has been living with the syndrome of guilt for the 
"revival process" [forcible name-changing of ethnic Muslims in 
1984-85]. 
  However, people gradually returned to their senses, 
especially following [DPS leader] Dogan's "turn to the left," 
when even in the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] people started 
to see the truth. 
  The truth is simple. No matter what posts the DPS leaders 
held in the totalitarian structures and what slogans they raised 
following 10 November 1989, they still remain the exponents of 
certain regional interests, and they will always act the same. 
The burned Bulgarian flags and desecrated monuments in the 
Rhodopes unmistakably prove this. 
  It now remains for them to recapture the last position held 
by the Bulgarian state in this region. For the DPS, it is of 
vital importance, because its electorate continues to emigrate 
in a southeasterly direction. Yet the movement's leaders have 
done nothing substantial to protect their social and economic 
interests. Now they have decided that, by appointing their own 
people to posts in the economic administration, they will manage 
to deceive their electorate into voting for them again. 
  Of course, the crazy person is not the one who eats the pie 
offered, but the one who permits this gastronomic prodigality. 
  For far too long, the state institutions have pretended to 
be 
deaf and blind to the tactics of ethnic separatism that the DPS 
is to all intents and purposes practising in the mixed areas in 
question. In many states that we call normal and extol as 
models of democracy, Osman Oktay would have long had his 
parliamentary immunity removed and been charged with treason for 
making such a statement.

  [Text] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] will name its 
prime ministerial candidate at its extraordinary congress on 4 
June. Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman for the party, 
also told today's press briefing that he did not know of any 
MSZP leaders having held talks with Miklos Nemeth on the 
possibility of him returning home. Here are further excerpts 
from the press briefing. 
  [Begin recording] [Szekeres] Inasmuch as it becomes a member 
of government -- and this can be expected with great probability 
-- the MSZP will respect landed property. We would like to 
complete the process of compensation, as soon as possible. We 
think that the law adopted by the National Assembly on the 
(?return) of church real estate must be implemented. 
  Our position concerning privatization is clear: We would 
like to use it as a means for drawing in capital, for creating 
employment, and for renewing technology. We are not preparing 
for small-scale or large clear-outs. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The executive deputy chairman 
said he would like the election campaign to deal with these 
questions from now on. Coalition talks will be held after the 
29 May elections. Then the new government will have to quickly 
take stock of what is handed over by the outgoing government -- 
that is, the state of the budget, state assets, assumed 
guarantees, payment obligations, and reserves. The MSZP is 
preparing at a rapid pace for government work, the deputy 
chairman said. 
  [Szekeres] We do not fear a 50-percent share of 
parliamentary 
seats, or two-thirds either. We would not fear such a thing in 
the case of any party, because there is a constitutional setup. 
There is an institution of the president of Republic, there is 
a parliamentary opposition. There is a Constitution, there is 
press publicity, and there is a Constitutional Court. Therefore 
the power is divided, and that is good, because only in this way 
can a balance be created in connection with any branch of power.

<F P=106> [Article by Andras Koves, scientific director of the </F>
Institute for Business Cycle and Market Research and the 
Processing of Foreign-Trade Data: "Can the Worsening of the 
Balance of Payments Be Halted? The Economic-Policy Dilemmas of 
Export's Decline"] 
  [Text] The development and state of Hungary's foreign trade 
are investigated usually on the basis of trade data reported in 
dollars. The figures for dollar-denominated trade from 1988 
through 1992 show exceptionally dynamic growth. They are very 
impressive even if we know that ruble-denominated trade has 
ceased in the meantime. Until 1988-1989, transactions 
denominated in hard currency accounted for about 60 percent of 
our foreign trade. Since 1991, however, practically all of 
Hungary's foreign trade has been denominated in hard currency. 
  Our dollar-denominated exports nearly doubled between 1988 
and 1992. The growth of imports was even faster--it more than 
doubled during that period. The growth of imports accelerated in 
1993, but there was an unprecedented sharp decline in exports. 
As a result, the balance of payments showed a very significant 
current account deficit. 
  On the basis of its rapid growth through 1992, foreign trade 
seemed a success in comparison with the national economy's other 
branches. There was debate about whether the success had 
occurred despite, or actually as a direct result of the 
Hungarian economy's general depression. The former view was 
held by those who felt that the growth of exports could be 
attributed to significant effort, and not just to economic 
necessity; and that economic policy had to maintain and 
stimulate the orientation to export. The other group's opinion 
was based on the belief that the Soviet (or rather CEMA) 
market's collapse and the contraction of domestic demand 
automatically compelled producers to storm foreign markets and, 
therefore, export incentives were unnecessary. Anyhow, it seemed 
that the shift in foreign trade had been completed, and 
adjustment to foreign markets was faster than had been expected. 
  Naturally, last year's events have modified the above 
assessments. It is obvious that both domestic and foreign 
factors played a role the sharp decline in exports. But the fact 
that, among the former socialist countries, the decline in 
Hungary's exports was uniquely severe indicates that Western 
Europe's recession cannot be regarded by any means as the 
decline's decisive cause. There are many possible domestic 
economic explanations that could be offered. What distinguished 
Hungary from several other Central European countries, until the 
autumn of 1993, was an exchange-rate policy that revalued the 
forint in real terms. Consequently, Hungarian export's 
cost-competitiveness declined. while import's 
cost-competitiveness against domestic production increased. In 
addition, the arsenal of export incentives that Hungarian 
economic policy employed was very meager. 
  Because farm and food-industry products traditionally play 
an 
important role in Hungary's exports (their significance is much 
greater than in the exports of our competitors), the 
agricultural sector's collapse in recent years inevitably caused 
serious harm to export trends. But we are not talking only about 
agriculture. From 1992 on, "supply-side shock therapy" had an 
unfavorable affect on the entire economy. I have in mind 
primarily the statutory regulations (the Bankruptcy Law, the 
Accounting Law, and the Banking Law) that were introduced in 
quick succession, amidst a severe recession. The statutory 
regulations rocked the enterprises that were in an already 
unstable financial situation, coping with marketing problems and 
by no means able to say that the difficulties created by the 
transformation were behind them. This reduced the available 
stocks of commodities and had an unfavorable effect on the 
ability to export. 
  A protracted and deep recession--in conflict with earlier 
views--does not help exports in any way. To the contrary, after 
a time it makes a decline in export value inevitable. 
Essentially the point is that between 1990 and 1992, even during 
the dynamic growth of dollar-denominated exports at current 
prices, the total export volume dropped by about 7 or 8 percent. 
The export volume's shrinkage accelerated in 1993: its decline 
was 13 percent. On the import side, a decline similar to that of 
export in 1990-1992 was followed in 1993 by dynamic growth (of 
21 percent, according to official statistics). From the 
preceding it is evident that, until 1992, the decline in exports 
was less than in GDP or in industrial and farm output. Amidst 
the economy's general contraction, that was a considerable 
achievement. On the other hand, the data also show that the 
switching of markets actually occurred, but at a much lower 
level of export activity than in 1990. Thus, even before 1993, 
the export problems had been much greater than they seemed. In 
the light of the processes that took place during the preceding 
years, therefore, last year's export trends are even less 
surprising. Finally, the negative and positive signs, 
respectively, of the development of exports and imports in 1993 
make it more unambiguous how serious the tensions are that 
developed in Hungary's foreign trade last year. 
  The conclusions that can be drawn from all this are as 
follows: 
  1. At the beginning of the 1990's, the problems of our 
foreign trade (and balance of payments) eased only temporarily, 
and today they are hampering the search for a way out just as 
much as they did four years ago. The only difference is merely 
that the economy (GDP) has declined by more than 20 percent 
since then. 
  2. Today and in the future, our external economic policy has 
to (or should) focus on an opening to the world market. In the 
short term, however, external economic policy is a function of 
business-cycle policy; and the question is how the strategy of 
an opening to the world market can be reconciled, if at all 
possible, with a business-cycle policy that is inevitably 
restrictive. 
  3. It is certain that a current deficit such as the one in 
the 1993 balance of payments cannot be maintained over a longer 
period of time. The only thing debatable about the deficit is 
whether it can be reduced this year or be allowed to ride 
through 1994, in which case a decision regarding possible 
austerity measures would have to be made next year, in the light 
of the external economic situation and the domestic developments 
by that time. Sound arguments can be presented in support of 
either variant. Technically--primarily as a result of our 
relatively substantial foreign currency reserves and the 
continuing influx of foreign direct investment--also a a 
wait-and-see policy could be pursued. But if the deficit on 
current account in the balance of payments continues to rise 
until the elections or thereafter, we will have to reckon with 
the possibility of a worsening of the conditions for obtaining 
external financing, to an extent such that a more drastic 
curtailment of domestic expenditure will then become necessary. 
In this sense, then, we have a choice between curtailing 
domestic expenditures as soon as possible, or curtailing it more 
drastically later on. There is no doubt as to which option 
economic common sense would support. 
  Yet, that is not the real dilemma. I suspect that the 
restrictive stages have not really been successful either. I am 
far from convinced that, when Hungarian economic policy resorted 
to stimulation or restriction, it did so at the right time and 
in the right way. Yet I do not think that business-cycle policy 
in the narrower sense is to blame for the economy's serious 
situation. Behind the external economic tensions there are 
structural problems that cannot be solved merely with these 
instruments.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Building and Civil-Engineering </F>
Contractors. Fewer Large Enterprises, More Small Ones--first 
paragraph is NEPSZABADSAG introduction] 
  [Text] The Hungarian construction industry underwent a 
significant transformation in recent years. Several of the large 
enterprises that earlier had dominated the construction industry 
went bankrupt; others have been reorganized and are continuing 
to function. From 1992 to 1993, the number of organizations 
employing over 300 persons dropped by nearly one-fourth, while 
the number of firms employing fewer than 20 workers increased by 
one-third. 
  According to the data of the Ministry of Industry and Trade 
(IKM), in December of last year there were more than 64,500 
contractors in the construction industry. That includes 
incorporated construction organizations as well as sole 
proprietors. Since the 1980's, the construction market has been 
shrinking continually. Therefore it is not surprising that 
nearly 90 percent of the businesses employ fewer than 10 persons 
each. At the same time, the number of firms employing fewer than 
20 workers and organized as business associations is continuing 
to rise. The total number of employees was 135,600 in 1993, 4.2 
percent less than the year before. Once the Bankruptcy Law came 
into force, many of the large construction-industry enterprises 
of years past petitioned to be declared bankrupt. But most of 
these large enterprises, which usually held substantial assets 
but were burdened with huge debt, had already transferred their 
capacities to business associations that had split off from 
them. Therefore the liquidation of the enterprises' stripped 
headquarters became inevitable. At the same time, several former 
state enterprises are continuing to function as corporations, 
after drastically trimming their personnel and selling off 
assets. The survival of firms employing more than 300 persons is 
typical mostly of construction industry's civil-engineering 
branch. Such organizations account for more than half of the 
existing capacity within the branch. The IKM reports that there 
were 113 such firms in Hungary in 1992, and 91 in 1993. In the 
building industry, the proportions of the organizations within 
the individual size-categories are about equal. In the 
specialized building trades and in building maintenance, 
however, small firms are the dominant. 
  The participation of foreign capital increased further in 
recent years. At the end of 1992, there were about 700 joint 
ventures among the incorporated organizations. Their combined 
total registered capital was 24 billion forints, of which 16.3 
billion forints was held by foreigners. At the same time, nearly 
230 joint ventures were formed last year. Their capital stock 
was 3.3 billion forints, of which 1.8 billion belonged to 
foreigners. On average, foreigners hold 55 percent of the equity 
in the newly formed joint ventures, while the proportion of 
foreign direct investment is close to 20 percent. 
  In 1993, the firms within the construction industry produced 
241.5 billion forints' worth of construction and installation 
work. At current prices, this output was 13 percent more than 
the year before. In the first quarter [of 1993]--because of pro 
forma invoices due to changes in VAT refunds, and as a result of 
the Accounting Law's coming into effect--output was 9 percent 
lower than in the same period of the preceding year. This lag 
was reduced to 1 percent by the end of the second quarter. 
Thereafter there was a 20-percent rise in output by the end of 
September, followed by a 4-percent decline. The price level of 
construction work rose by 13.2 percent in 1993, which was 
somewhat less than the rise in 1992. The price level's rise was 
slightly below average in the building industry, and in 
civil-engineering industry it was 1 percentage point above the 
average.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Five Companies Would Prospect for </F>
Oil in Hungary. Three Are Eyeing the Trans-Danubian 
Region"--first paragraph is NEPSZABADSAG introduction] 
  [Text] The five companies that submitted tenders for 
concessions to produce oil and natural gas would be spending 
more than five billion forints on prospecting and exploration. 
The invitation to tender closed Monday, and its results will be 
announced in June. 
  As Antal Fust, the deputy chairman of the Hungarian Bureau 
of 
Mines, told our reporter, initially 22 international companies 
had bought the package of data on oil and natural gas deposits 
in Hungary, and five of them submitted tenders for concessions. 
Three of them would like to prospect and explore in the 
Trans-Danubian Region; and the other two, in the Danube-Tisza 
interfluve. Of course, they would also want to produce oil or 
natural gas if their prospecting and exploration proves 
successful. 
  First, experts will examine and comment on the submitted 
tenders, from the viewpoint of technological, economic and other 
considerations. Then a jury, consisting of representatives of 
the central agencies concerned, will review the tenders and 
submit its recommendations to the minister of industry and 
trade, on which companies should be awarded concessions. On 
first reading it appears that all the tenders satisfy the 
requirements, Antal Fust said. 
  If all five companies get concessions, that will mean a 
foreign investment of about 5.0 billion forints in oil and gas 
prospecting and exploration in Hungary. 
  According to the plans, the foreign companies will use 
Hungarian enterprises as their subcontractors.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Not Much Land Has Been Left Fallow. </F>
The State of the Crops Is Good"--first paragraph is NEPSZABADSAG 
introduction] 
  [Text] Thanks to the favorable spring weather, the state of 
the winter grains is extremely good. That was the most important 
conclusion from the aerial inspection to which Laszlo 
Medgyasszay, political state secretary at the Ministry of 
Agriculture, invited the press. 
  When viewed from the air, it is striking that cultivation of 
large plots is still predominantly typical of crop production. 
Although there are small plots here and there, some of the new 
smallholders are leasing their land to large-scale farms. And 
one encounters also spontaneous associations. There is 
substantially less land left fallow: 250,000 hectares, 5 percent 
of the sowing area. 
  The experts accompanying the reporters pointed out that the 
absence of artificial fertilizers in recent years is evident on 
the fields. At the press conference following the aerial 
inspection, the additional information was supplied that, in 
spite of everything, the situation has improved this year in 
comparison with recent years: the amount of artificial 
fertilizer applied this year was double the amount used last 
year, but several more years would be needed for agriculture to 
attain the level needed for high quality crop production. 
  At the news conference after the inspection, the political 
state secretary also said that the submitted applications for 
loans from the Agricultural Development Fund would be judged 
between 1 and 15 May. It seems that the fund's present 
allocation would not be enough to satisfy the entire demand for 
loans. Therefore the applications are being arranged in the 
sequence they were received. The applications for which the 
money in the fund has run out will not be rejected for good. 
Instead, they will be set aside until the fund will have been 
replenished. For the time being, the state secretary has been 
unable to make a definite promise as to when that would happen.

<F P=106> [Article by Gizella Ivan: "Only the Parliament Has the Right </F>
To Put a Stop to It; It Would Mean Loss of Prestige"] 
  [Text] Challenging the expo is a very harmful move, Chief 
Commissioner Etelka Pataky Barsi said yesterday at a very 
exclusive discussion. "And the reason is," she continued, "that 
the world considers Hungary to be a democratic country. In other 
words, once the country undertook international obligations, one 
assumes that it will fulfill them." 
  "It never even occurred to me to consider the legal 
consequences of a possible cancellation of the world fair," the 
chief commissioner emphasized. (There are no legal consequences 
of canceling the event, but the loss of prestige can be 
considerable. And should an invited country have already 
invested a certain amount in Hungary, and should the event be 
canceled, the foreign country can sue for damages. -- Editor) 
  "The new government will most probably survey the issues and 
projects in progress," Mrs. Barsi said, "but only the parliament 
has the right to put a stop to them." According to the chief 
commissioner, canceling the expo would be an illogical step for 
several reasons, because the entire event is being organized in 
such a way that almost every site can be utilized afterwards. 
  It seems that the antagonism between Budapest leaders and 
the 
programming office was revived in the last few days. According 
to Budapest, the city needs 50 billion forints [Ft] to implement 
the expo, but the chief commissioner says that the remaining 
time is only sufficient to carry out work in Budapest in the 
amount of no more than Ft24 billion, and that money is there. 
  "Some people also claim," the chief commissioner said, "that 
the Universitas bonds are not successful, but actually they were 
oversold." 
  To the question of MAGYAR HIRLAP--because Mrs. Barsi ran for 
the parliament--how she imagines her work in the programming 
office in the future, she replied that she did not run as an 
individual representative. If all goes well, she wants to 
continue to deal with the expo in the parliament, as well. True 
enough, she will not always be able to participate in committee 
meetings, but the Hungarian Democratic Forum thinks that it is a 
good idea for someone to represent the expo in the parliament. 
"I also kept my seat in Budapest, and I was not present at every 
meeting, but if my work is scrutinized, it will be found that I 
am among the top 10 people who did something for the city," Mrs. 
Barsi said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nicolae Manolescu, president of the Civic </F>
Alliance Party, PAC, by Ralu Filip; place and date not given: 
"The Idea of a Coalition Government Is No Longer Topical"] 
  [Text] [Filip] The majority of commentators and political 
leaders argue that we are facing a moment of political crisis. 
I would like to ask you whether you agree with this view and to 
give us your opinion about the reasons, consequences, and 
prospects of this crisis. 
  [Manolescu] I believe that the major reason for the current 
political crisis is connected with the fact that the 
parliamentary majority and the government backed by it have not 
yet found the appropriate solutions to the problems that we are 
facing. Not only have they not found the solutions, but the y 
have also set off on a path that leads nowhere. Or rather, it 
does not lead to any of the solutions that would solve Romania's 
current problems. In turn, the parliamentary opposition has 
virtually exhausted all avenues of negotiations or understanding 
with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] aimed at 
finding a solution, other than early elections and a change in 
the parliamentary configuration. A month or two ago, when the 
negotiations between the opposition and the ruling party began, 
I was optimistic and believed that together we could find a 
solution that would not involve early elections. Today I am no 
longer sure that there is such a solution. 
  [Filip] Do you believe that early elections could be the 
solution to the current political crisis? 
  [Manolescu] The early elections option is double-edged. In 
addition, we are not sure that the elections would create an 
acceptable and reformist configuration of Parliament. To start 
burdening people with an electoral campaign now, with all the 
expense that this involves, would ultimately mean ignoring that 
people want to know what they are going to eat tomorrow, whether 
they will have jobs, and whether inflation will be kept more or 
less under control. Thus, it means forgetting all these things 
and producing electoral slogans again, which, no matter how 
generous they are, cannot ensure food or the other things that 
people need. That is why, in my view, early elections would 
involve a certain amount of immorality. However, if there is no 
other way, ultimately we may resort to it. 
  [Filip] Let us imagine that the PDSR did not reach an 
understanding with the opposition and that this did not result 
in early elections. How would the country be governed under 
such circumstances? 
  [Manolescu] Unfortunately it would not be possible to rule 
the country under such circumstances. I will give you an 
example in this respect. One of the objections to government 
policy is the excessive delay in implementing privatization and 
the preservation of bankrupt enterprises. The MEBO [Management 
and Employee Buy-On] program proposed at one stage has been 
contested by everybody. Even in the PDSR program there is a 
clear statement that the MEBO program is not efficient and 
involves great risks. We have suggested an alternative, that 
is, a privatization program, which the CDR [Democratic 
Convention of Romania] and the PD(FSN) [Democratic Party 
(National Salvation Front)] have also accepted in principle. We 
presented this program to the trade unions and the economists 
and held a symposium on it in Buftea, and everywhere we received 
a favorable response, meaning that people said yes, this program 
indeed suggests a solution and must be given a try. But the 
PDSR is ignoring this program just because it comes from the PAC 
[Civic Alliance Party].... We believe that the program 
represents a viable solution and must be discussed and never 
mind who initiated it and who drafted it. We do not wish to 
turn this program into political capital. However, we are keen 
that it should be implemented. There is another aspect worth 
mentioning here. Our program, or anybody else's program of this 
kind, cannot be implemented at any time that we wish to do so. 
Thus, we are linked to a deadline and this deadline is the 
beginning of next autumn at the latest. To achieve a 
privatization program we need certain laws that must be passed 
by Parliament, thus presupposing parliamentary support and the 
broadest possible political and social basis. The majority on 
which the PDSR now relies does not respond to this requirement, 
in spite of the greater number of seats that they hold, which 
nobody knows for how long. Delaying the privatization process 
leads to hyper-inflation and, further, to a deterioration to the 
very limits of social life. And how can one govern under 
conditions of social instability? 
  [Filip] Recently, in an interview granted to our newspaper, 
Mr. Corneliu Coposu [president of the National Peasant Christian 
Democratic Party-PDSR] came up with a way to get out of the 
current crisis by forming a cooperation government, which should 
be made up of parties with different, even opposing, ideologies 
and programs, and which should rule on the basis of a minimal 
program jointly agreed upon. We can call it interesting that 
[PDSR President] Oliviu Gherman also expressed a similar support 
for the idea of a minimal program that could be followed by any 
government or parliamentary combination. In spite of these 
similarities and convergence of ideas, a cooperation government 
and minimal program are far from being accomplished. Thus, the 
following question arises: How sincere are the proposals made 
by political leaders? How sincere is their will to reach an 
understanding that is of benefit to the country? 
  [Manolescu] I could say that in this case the issue of 
sincerity does not have any importance. Sometimes we are 
compelled to do certain things against our beliefs or interests. 
Basically, I am not even interested in whether the sides 
involved in such a discussion are sincere or not. What is 
important is that they should reach an agreement. Better a 
hypocrisy that leads to an accord than a sincerity that 
disunites. 
  Second, the idea of a coalition government is no longer 
topical. This was discussed after the Cotroceni meeting, when 
the opposition put to Iliescu a proposal to mediate between the 
CDR and the PDSR. This issue is no longer topical. At that 
time we proceeded from the following course of actions: We said 
that first of all we, that is, both sides, should sit down and 
examine whether -- as Mr. Gherman said -- there is the 
possibility of agreement on a minimal program. This would have 
been the first compulsory stage. Then, if we agreed on such a 
program, we should examine how it could be implemented. But to 
implement something you need laws. Therefore, we need the 
support of the opposition, which it should grant to the 
government under certain conditions and for a given period of 
time. Then, finally, when we have the program and we have the 
laws, we must also have the people to do the work. These were 
our proposals: a minimal program, a different parliamentary 
configuration, and a coalition government. We never reached the 
stage of seriously discussing the second and third proposals 
because we never sat down to discuss the minimal program! 
  [Filip] Why not? 
  [Manolescu] First of all because of mutual suspicion. Each 
side suspected the other of being insincere. However, I want to 
repeat: It seems useless to discuss this issue because I can 
understand that even when the PDSR is not sincere in embarking 
on an action, it will still do so because it is under pressure 
from the IMF, the trade unions, its own electorate, or the 
general situation prevailing in Romania. 
  [Filip] Oliviu Gherman affirmed that there is no political 
crisis in Romania because there is a parliamentary majority of 
53 percent. He also said that the tacit understanding of the 
PDSR with the PSM [Socialist Workers Party], the PRM [Greater 
Romania Party], and the PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party], 
which have allegedly accepted the PDSR program, is satisfactory 
for governing the country. Do you believe that Romania can be 
ruled on the basis of such a political formula? 
  [Manolescu] Officially, there is no political crisis. We 
have a Constitution, a Parliament, a government, a president, an 
opposition, and all that. However, if we consider that 
Parliament does not succeed in passing laws that are necessary 
for the reform, that the government comes up with a draft budget 
that aims to support bankrupt enterprises and not revive and 
assist those able to produce something and the private sector, 
then we do face a political crisis. Because neither we nor they 
are doing anything. We cannot because we are not governing. 
Those who are do nothing because they have other interests or 
because they are also blocked by God knows what mental inertia, 
so to speak. 
  [Filip] Do you think that the current government coalition 
is able to implement the economic reform in Romania? 
  [Manolescu] The current coalition has no means of 
implementing such a reform in Romania. A lot of shortfalls have 
appeared in this coalition -- which includes the PDSR, the PUNR, 
the PSM, and the PRM. The PUNR currently wishes to withdraw its 
support and denounce the protocol with the PDSR; the PSM has 
made explosive declarations regarding current social life; and 
the PRM has acted in a similar fashion. It is clear that the 
PDSR cannot go any further with these allies, especially as far 
as reform policy is concerned. It must decide whether it wants 
to continue moving along with its current allies and with 
pseudo-reforms, which will lead to hyperinflation and disaster 
or look for allies somewhere else and negotiate each point of a 
minimal program with them. 
  [Filip] Do you really believe that the shortcomings that you 
are talking about are real? What can stop the PSM, PRM, and 
PUNR members of parliament from continuing to vote with the PDSR? 
  [Manolescu] The shortfalls are real. It was possible for 
the PSM and PRM to vote for the investiture program, and the 
memorandum with the IMF was a contradiction of their own 
doctrines and platforms. In other words, the PSM and PRM voted 
for a program that is 80 percent liberal. The memorandum with 
the IMF, except for the excessive taxation and two or three 
additional things, is almost a liberal program. I do not 
believe that [PSM President] Verdet can continue with such a 
program to the very end and to the very last consequences. The 
PDSR should take this into account. The support that comes from 
the left is temporary and it will last only as long as the PSM 
and PRM wish to remain in the coalition because they have 
certain interests in doing so. At the moment I do not know what 
type of games will be played before the elections, but you will 
see that the two parties, even the PUNR, will denounce the 
government. As a matter of fact, this is happening even now. 
The press is full of accusations and criticism against the 
government voiced by its current allies. 
  [Filip] I agree: During the voting in Parliament, all those 
who criticized the government are supporting it... 
  [Manolescu] Here we are witnessing a political game and I 
believe that this game will last only as long as the conditions 
that generated it also last. When they no longer have an 
interest -- around the time of the elections, for example -- the 
PSM, PRM, and PUNR will withdraw from the coalition, and the 
reason that they will invoke for this move will be that they can 
no longer participate in the country's disaster because they 
would lose credibility and their own electorate, which is 
attached to the idea of state ownership and does not want reform 
but rather the conservation of certain structures. Since the 
existence of these parties and their political success depend 
directly on a certain type of voter, they cannot afford to risk 
too much. 
  There is a certain limit that they cannot exceed. That is 
why the PDSR must understand that if it wants a reform program, 
then it has to look for reformist allies. If it does not want 
this, then it can stay with its current allies. But in that 
case, it will get into an impasse and that will be the moment 
when the political crisis will no longer be -- as Mr. Gherman 
says -- only a rumor but a real one, and it might bring about 
the fall of the government. 
  [Filip] If we were guided by the results of the latest 
opinion poll, which indicates a very high percentage in favor of 
the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian Democratic Party], we 
could conclude that there is a risk that the size of the CDR 
might be reduced and mixed up with the PNTCD. Am I mistaken or 
is there indeed such a risk? 
  [Manolescu] There was such a risk especially during the last 
elections and it continues to remain. But this is a risk that 
we have accepted and the PNTCD -- we must admit this -- 
emphasized it as much as it could. This situation suited 
them.... Now it is to be seen if in the next elections the 
electorate will want a convention that can be identified with 
the PNTCD or one in which each political formation, starting 
with the most radical and ending with the most "well behaved," 
is appropriately represented. As far as the opinion polls are 
concerned, I read them in two ways. First, as if they were 
perfectly correct. However, I ask myself what will happen at 
the elections, because Romania is not a country where you can 
say that if the opinion polls come up with a certain result, 
this will also be the result of the elections. Then, there is 
another way of reading them. I do not believe that in our 
country opinion polls are not manipulated. The sympathies and 
antipathies of those who conduct them are quite obvious, so this 
is a situation in which I read the opinion polls as signals 
coming from those who manipulate them and who wish to implant a 
certain idea in my mind. Why is the CDR leading and why does the 
PNTCD have a higher percentage than it could have hoped for? 
The opinion polls may create a certain state of mind that makes 
us believe that we are already the winners. Thus, let us have 
early elections and win them! But then we go into the elections 
and realize that we have lost again! I distance myself from 
such opinion polls. 
  [Filip] Is the CDR a political formula compatible with the 
liberal alternative? 
  [Manolescu] We have said that it would seem normal to us if 
the PNL [National Liberal Party] returned to the CDR, where it 
was from the beginning and from which it withdrew because of an 
error committed by Mr. [Radu] Campeanu [former PNL leader], an 
error that, as a matter of fact, cost him dearly. In this way 
two very clear political factions could be established within 
the CDR. The Christian democratic side and the liberal side. 
This however does not mean a split in the CDR, but a certain 
clarification that is recommended both for parties as well as 
for the electorate. That is all, it means nothing else! 
  [Filip] Let us assume that the CDR won the elections. In 
what direction would Romania move? 
  [Manolescu] From an economic point of view it would move 
according to liberal doctrine. There is no alternative on this 
point, as even social democratic parties prove to be liberal 
when they come up with reform programs. From the social 
viewpoint, none of the liberal parties is so naive as to believe 
that a sudden liberal reform without social protection, without 
elements that would consolidate the family and the civic 
society, can produce positive results. Thus, there would be no 
great problem because the liberals and the Christian democrats 
understand each other on fundamental issues. They also talk 
about a liberal economy just as we talk about the civic society 
and social protection. There is no other way. 
  [Filip] Currently, the liberal parties are split and some of 
them are troubled by internal conflicts. Therefore, the image 
of Romanian liberalism is about to be discredited. What would 
be the consequences of a possible failure of liberalism at the 
next elections? 
  [Manolescu] The current image of our liberalism is very poor 
and if the liberal movement fails it will be a disaster. The 
PAC and the PL'93 [Liberal Party '93] have been in conflict not 
for ideological reasons in the first place, although there are 
certainly differences between us, but mainly for personal 
reasons. There is a struggle between two wings within the PNL, 
a struggle between two leaders who are not separated by 
differences of doctrine. If the liberal parties do not learn 
how to set aside these confrontations of a personal nature and 
generated by arrogance, then it means that they want to commit 
suicide. The unification of the liberal movement does not 
necessarily mean a merger. You do not walk over all the 
personalities and place Patriciu [member of the PL'93 
leadership] in a position to give orders to [PNL President] 
Quintus or vice versa. But at least an alliance of principles 
and program can be achieved by maintaining the identity of each 
party. If liberalism fails, it will lead to the loss of its 
electorate and to the establishment of a parliament that 
resembles the parliament in Poland, with the consequent 
political consequences, among them the strengthening of the 
left.... 
  [Filip] On several occasions, representatives of the "A 
Future for Romania" group have stated that the traditional 
left-right model is worn out and another political formula is 
required. What is your opinion of this? 
  [Manolescu] I agree with it. In a society as confused as 
ours, a clear model with precise delimitations between right and 
left has never worked. Our electorate is not very receptive to 
terms such as right or left. However, we have no other choice 
because this is the classical definition of the fields of 
political force. Either we use them or we do not.... But I do 
not believe that the essence lies in terminology. I do not 
believe that an electoral campaign based on terms such as right 
or left will clarify things for many people. 
  [Filip] What formula would you suggest? 
  [Manolescu] Currently the situation is simple. Reformists 
and anti-reformists.... Thus, also the word reform should be 
checked to see whether it has been discredited in the 
post-December 1989 period.... However, let us say that we still 
have a tradition of four years of reformism and anti-reformism. 
Do you want changes or not? If you want changes, we understand 
each other. The pace and methods can be established later. But 
if you do not want changes, then there is nothing to talk about!

    [Editorial Report] Several Romanian papers carried reports 
and commentary on the death of Moses Rosen, chief rabbi and 
president of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania 
(FCE) and leader of the Romanian Jewish community since 1948, on 
6 May at the age of 81, as well as speculation about his 
possible successor. The independent daily Bucharest ADEVARUL on 
7 May published the FCE announcement of the death and a photo of 
Rosen on page 1 of its 7 May edition, and on 9 May published two 
photographs and a brief report on the funeral. The main 
opposition paper ROMANIA LIBERA, on the other hand, reported the 
death in a brief factual account on page 9 of its 7 May edition. 
<H5>  Possible Succession </H5>
  ADEVARUL speculated in an article on 9 May that a layman 
would probably be selected for the position of FCE president but 
that it would be "difficult to predict" who would succeed Rosen 
as chief rabbi, since there are "very few rabbis in Romania, and 
they are all quite old." ROMANIA LIBERA on 9 May opined that the 
president of the Jewish Community of Timisoara, Rabbi Dr. Ernest 
Neumann, would succeed Rosen as chief rabbi and that Sorin 
Iulian, former head of the General Inspectorate of the Militia 
in Bucharest, would be named president of the FCE. TINERETUL 
LIBER on 9 May reported that it had learned from "unauthorized 
sources" that Academician Dr. Nicolae Cajal had the best chance 
of taking over the leadership of this community. 
<H5>  President Iliescu Condemns Anti-Semitic Acts </H5>
  An article in the 9 May issue of the popular daily 
EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, which is consistently critical of Iliescu, 
reported on Rosen's funeral and on President Iliescu's reaction. 
In an article headlined "President Ion Iliescu Said That 
Thousands of Jews and Innocent Persons Were Massacred by the 
Romanian Fascists," the paper noted that Iliescu gave a 
"surprising" address at the funeral, "condemning in unequivocal 
terms, from his `position as head of state,' the years of the 
Iron Guard rebellion," referring to the fascist organization of 
the 30's and 40's. According to the article, Iliescu recalled a 
1976 ceremony in Iasi at which he and Rabbi Rosen unveiled a 
monument dedicated to the memory of persons "massacred" in 1941 
by "Romanian fascists under the protection of the state." 
Iliescu called it a "disgrace" that there are forces today which 
are "attempting to rehabilitate actions of inhuman cruelty 
committed against a population, not only against Jews, but 
against all peoples and against the Romanian people." He said 
that he had "lived through the horrible days and nights of the 
Iron Guard rebellion in 1941" and "knew the families which 
suffered the losses" and "all the atrocities Romanian Jews and 
Jews in other parts of Europe experienced and the sufferings the 
Romanian people endured under oppressive regimes." EVENIMENTUL 
ZILEI adds that, concluding this veritable confession and 
personal testimony," Iliescu expressed the hope that such 
moments "would never be repeated in the history of the Romanian 
people and of humanity" and stated that "public opposition to 
the new attempts to `regenerate' such trends is the common duty 
of all." 
<H5>  Other Reaction </H5>
  A condolence message to the FCE from the Executive Bureau of 
the Democratic Party, published in the party's paper, AZI, on 9 
May, praised Rosen, saying that "his prominent personality, 
which has a permanent place in contemporary history, will be, 
for the members of our party, an example of a brilliant scholar, 
a servant of God, a fighter for the defense of the interests of 
his community against extremism, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism 
and for the promotion of the values of humanity." 
  The youth newspaper TINERETUL LIBER of 9 May lauded Rabbi 
Rosen for "completely transforming the recent history of Judaism 
in Romania, fighting for freedom of religion for Jews and 
obtaining the emigration of more than 300,000 Jews to Israel in 
exchange for the payment of sums of money to Ceausescu. After 
the collapse of the Iron Curtain, Moses Rosen protested 
vehemently against attempts to rehabilitate [World War II-era 
dictator] Marshal Antonescu and against the anti-Semitic 
tendencies of some parties and publications in our country." 
  In contrast, Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor, one of Rabbi 
Rosen's strongest critics and owner and chief editor of the 
ultra-nationalist weekly ROMANIA MARE, presented a different 
picture of Rosen in the paper's 13 May issue. After introducing 
his article with the Latin saying "De mortuis nil nisi bene 
[bonum]" (Let nothing be said of the dead but good), Tudor 
admitted that he had a "strange feeling" when someone brought 
him the "good news" of Rabbi Rosen's death: "My greatest enemy 
was dead, and I was suffering as one would suffer after the 
death of a friend." 
  While he praised Rosen for participating in the 1 December 
1993 Alba Iulia National Day festivities celebrating the 
anniversary of the Union of the Principalities, much of his 
6,000-word article consisted of a denunciation of actions Rosen 
allegedly took against Tudor and against certain "respected 
Romanian writers" during the past 15 years. These actions, 
according to Tudor, included "falsifications of the truth," the 
removal of books from bookstores and libraries, and "defamatory 
statements" to the world press. Tudor also reported receiving 
critical telephone calls from "ordinary Romanians" who "were 
exasperated" because Radio Bucharest devoted two hours to the 
Rosen funeral services in Bucharest. Other commments Tudor says 
he heard were: "It's a wonder that Iliescu did not proclaim a 
national day of mourning!" "The richest man in Romania has died. 
Who got his money?" "Who is paying for the charter flight to 
Israel [where Rosen was buried]?" 
  Continuing, Tudor said: "This is not the time or the place 
to 
judge the rabbi's sins against the Romanian people. Who knows, 
perhaps they can be compensated for by his very great service to 
his people, Israel, helping about 400,000 Jews to leave Romania 
for the Promised Land, the land of their ancestors, which is 
quite admirable and to his credit! As for me, I have the courage 
and honesty to forgive him for the days and nights of nightmares 
he caused for my parents and for me. To forgive and forget is 
Christian. This is the difference between Christianity and 
Zionism, which does not forgive, does not forget, and even 
invents, constantly, other plagues, other holocausts, and other 
hunters of men." In conclusion, Tudor wrote: "Moses Rosen was a 
person of international caliber, an educated man, a brilliant 
scholar of the Bible and the Torah, a character from a novel, a 
devoted husband, a distinguished pastor of Jewish souls. I think 
that all these qualities will carry a lot of weight at the Last 
Judgement. May God forgive him his sins, value his merits, and 
give rest to his tormented soul. Lord have mercy on him! I 
forgave him long ago."

  [Text] During his visit to Paris yesterday, Presidency 
President Alija Izetbegovic made a statement for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina television. He spoke about the coming Geneva 
negotiations between our delegation and the contact group. 
  Izetbegovic said: We hesitated over whether to go to the 
talks. There were different stands on this issue. We concluded 
that the reasons for [words indistinct] prevailed. These are 
not real negotiations, and our delegation (?sees them) only as 
an opportunity to inform about the true state of affairs before 
the 30 May session of the Assembly of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have had indications that certain 
favorable changes have been made in the contact group, and we 
will try to exert influence on the contact group's stands. 
Public opinion in France and the United States seems to go in 
the direction which could exert influence on certain stands 
being changed to comply with our wishes. 
  Asked what he thought about the return to the negotiations 
of 
Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, President Izetbegovic 
said: Our great reservations about their involvement in the 
negotiating process are very well justified. It is well known 
that they have brought no good to us. They advocated stands 
which were against the interests of Bosnia-Herzegovina and, 
unfortunately, they were successful in doing that, so that it 
was difficult (?to play that game) with them. I think that our 
delegation at the meeting will speak out against the talks. We 
sent a letter demanding Yasushi Akashi's resignation. We 
refused to receive him on several occasions. I do not know how 
much they respect our opinion, and whether they believe they 
should act in line with our wishes. 
  Among other things, President Izetbegovic said the following 
about a possible denouement in the military and political 
spheres: Unfortunately, I cannot say that I expect a great deal 
because I have been frustrated by the failure of negotiations so 
far. I can say in particular that I do not expect much because 
the contact group is again repeating the percentage of 51 [for 
the Croats and Muslims] to 49 [for the Serbs], and we will see 
whether they have changed their position on this. We cannot 
[words indistinct] our occupied territories. The pressure 
exerted on us to accept the proposed 51-49 percentage could be 
(?seen) as the continuation of war, but not though our fault, 
but through the fault of those who have not given us choice. We 
keep repeating that we are in favor of a just peace. What is 
being offered to us is not just peace, unless considerable 
changes are made in future talks. 
  Regardless of what the world wants, it is, objectively 
speaking, pushing us toward war. They have not offered us any 
alternative. We have already defined our aims on the lower limit 
of a bearable minimum, but further concessions have been 
demanded of us. I believe that we can make no more concessions, 
President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic said among other 
things in an interview for Bosnia-Herzegovina television.

<F P=106> [Report by Borko Stosic from Geneva] </F>
  [Text] The Serbian delegation arrived in Geneva this 
afternoon. Immediately upon their arrival from the airport, 
President Krajisnik [title as heard] and Foreign Minister Aleksa 
Buha left for the Russian Permanent Mission to the United 
Nations where they sat down with the member of the contact group 
representing Russia. They stayed there for nearly two hours and 
afterward went directly to the Palace of Nations to meet with 
Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. This meeting lasted for 
quite some time. 
  At approximately 1700, after the meeting, Momcilo Krajisnik 
gave a brief statement for the press in which he stressed that 
the Serbian Republic delegation will participate in the talks on 
three conditions: 
  That it be given a perfectly equal status; 
  That all hostilities end immediately; 
  That the percentages regarding the division of territories 
be 
a subject of discussion and negotiations and not determined in 
advance by a dictate. Namely, if this is the case then there is 
no reason for the talks. 
  Regarding [President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency] 
Alija Izetbegovic, he is repeating his stance that he had not 
arrived to negotiate but to merely inform himself and establish 
contacts with the representatives of the United States and 
Russia in the contact group.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic by Nigel </F>
Rahimpour; place and date not given: "`Akashi Is Concluding 
Deals With the Serbs'"] 
  [Text] [Rahimpour] Following Gorazde, will Brcko also 
fall to the Serbs? 
  [Ganic] We will defend ourselves, but, because of the arms 
embargo, we have only a limited number of armor-piercing 
weapons. Serbia will continue fighting. The Serbian offensive 
will continue, because they have received contradictory signals 
from the international community. In Gorazde, the Serbs got 
round the NATO ultimatum. NATO should have put the Serbs heavy 
weapons out of action, but Mr. Akashi failed to give a green 
light. He preferred to have 100 dead and 1,000 injured Bosnians 
to the destruction of 30 Serbian tanks. 
  [Rahimpour] Do you believe that UN emissary Akashi has been 
making deals with the Serbs? 
  [Ganic] Instead of respecting UN resolutions, Akashi has 
been working closely with the Serbs. The high point came when 
he allowed them to take their tanks from Sarajevo and position 
them in places from where they can attack our positions. He is 
responsible for the deaths of people in Gorazde. He could have 
prevented the massacre. 
  [Rahimpour] How do you envisage the establishment of peace? 
  [Ganic] The Serbs should return land to the Croats and 
Moslems. That means a withdrawal from those areas where Croats 
and Moslems constitute a majority. 
  [Rahimpour] Are you satisfied with 51 percent of Bosnia's 
territory? 
  [Ganic] The Serbs are talking about 51 percent, we want 
more. We will begin by implementing the federation on the 
territory that we control. We will continue with our efforts 
using political means, but if necessary, we will also resort to 
other means. 
  [Rahimpour] Military means? 
  [Ganic] The international community should tell us how we 
are to recover our territory. 
  [Rahimpour] What do your territorial claims mean in 
quantitative terms? 
  [Ganic] We are demanding about 66 percent of the Bosnian 
territory that was held by Croats or Moslems before the war. 
For the sake of peace, it could also be somewhat less than 
that, but then that would have to be settled beforehand with 
those private property owners who have been expelled. The best 
thing would be a federation in which everyone could return to 
where they come from. We are only calling for the restoration of 
the situation that existed before the war. 
  [Rahimpour] What else do you want? 
  [Ganic] We want the war criminals to be identified and 
sentenced. Only then can we live together once again. People 
who left their sons or daughters in the genocide will be able to 
direct their hatred away from those who carried out orders and 
project it onto the responsible war criminals. 
  [Rahimpour] What are the limits to your readiness to reach a 
compromise? 
  [Ganic] The Serbs will not, of course, receive any territory 
from us that does not belong to them, unless the European Union 
and the United States give them land. 
  [Rahimpour] Can the enclaves in eastern Bosnia survive? 
  [Ganic] Yes, people only need to be given back what belongs 
to them, and the United Nations should protect the enclaves. 
  [Rahimpour] But who can guarantee that the corridors linking 
the greater part of the country and the enclaves in eastern 
Bosnia will not be severed by the Serbs at some point? 
  [Ganic] Any agreement must guarantee the security of the 
enclaves. Not only our army, but the United Nations too should 
protect them. In the end, the United Nations created the 
enclaves. They should also defend them now. 
  [Rahimpour] But the United Nations cannot even defend 
itself. 
  [Ganic] It can. After all, they have 300 NATO jets at their 
disposal. 
  [Rahimpour] Would you be prepared to exchange the enclaves 
in eastern Bosnia for more land in central Bosnia? 
  [Ganic] No! There can be no Bosnia without eastern Bosnia. 
Land west of the Drina River has never belonged to the Serbs. 
  [Rahimpour] Does the Moslem-Croatian alliance have a future? 
  [Ganic] Yes, of course. It constitutes a renaissance of 
part of Bosnia, a renaissance that should extend to the entire 
country. 
  [Rahimpour] Have the peace negotiations in Geneva become 
irrelevant? 
  [Ganic] Yes, unless the military balance between us and the 
Serbs can be restored. That is the only way in which one can 
make them give us more land.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serbian General Ratko Mladic by Valerio </F>
Pellizzari in Belgrade; date not given: "I, The War-And-Death 
Lord"] 
  [Text] Belgrade --Ratko Mladic is the true warlord in 
Bosnia. His artillery has shelled Knin, Sarajevo, Tuzla, and all 
the other towns with Muslim majorities -- without making any 
distinction between civil and military targets. This general 
has become Greater Serbia's protector, the symbol of ethnic 
cleansing in Bosnia. The appointment was on Belgrade's hills, 
far from the din of war. 
  [Pellizzari] Why did you relentlessly shell Gorazde, a UN 
safe area? 
  [Mladic] We attacked after the Muslims had attacked us for 
15 
days. They were firing on our positions in an attempt to link 
up with the other safe areas which are under their control -- 
not to defend themselves, but in order to spread the war in 
Serbia and Montenegro. 
  [Pellizzari] The snipers were targeting children too, and 
the 
shells were falling on hospitals. 
  [Mladic] You should have asked Izetbegovic these same 
questions two years ago, when they attacked our military 
hospital. Or in 1991, when the Croats were beheading women and 
children on the banks of the Korana river, or when they blew up 
Serbian homes with people still inside them, and then sang 
"Thank You, Germany" in German. 
  [Pellizzari] Near Tuzla, late at night, you also fired on UN 
Blue Helmets. 
  [Mladic] The report you saw is completely false. The clash 
took place in the night of 29 April. The Blue Helmets fired 72 
shells, killing nine people and wounding others. They attacked 
because they want to transform Tuzla into a NATO airfield. In 
the past, they could move very freely in that area, and they did 
not fulfill their commitment to station Russian officers there. 
  [Pellizzari] Why do you always prefer Russian Blue Helmets? 
Do they favor you? 
  [Mladic] No, they are neutral. But a great country must 
intervene in this war in which all foreign countries are 
intervening. 
  [Pellizzari] Tito, however, did not believe all that much in 
Slav brotherhood and in Russia's disinterested involvement in 
this area. 
  [Mladic] This is a political question, and I do not wish to 
answer political questions, ever. However, I will make an 
exception. Without Tito and his drunken followers, this war 
would have never taken place. In any case, it was not us who 
started it. 
  [Pellizzari] Any agreement or compromise reached with you 
becomes fragile, uncertain. You were supposed to move away six 
tanks, under UN supervision, but instead you did things your own 
way. 
  [Mladic] It is a small episode. 
  [Pellizzari] Yes, but a significant one. 
  [Mladic] This is my country, and my country is sovereign 
within its borders. I am the one who decides where to locate 
troops and military equipment. Just as you decide at Aviano or 
Falconara [Italian air bases]. 
  [Pellizzari] Is there any difference between a war fought 
between armies and a war fought against unarmed civilians? 
  [Mladic] I have studied Hannibal, Alexander the Great, the 
Crusades, and World War I and II. This is the most difficult 
and the strangest war ever to have been fought on earth. It is 
a different conflict because our enemies were citizens in our 
own state. And it is a low-intensity war, as military experts 
say -- one decided abroad, by Europeans, by the Americans, by 
the Turks. 
  [Pellizzari] You see things in a very black-and-white 
fashion, with all the blame on one side. 
  [Mladic] Listen, to quarrel there must always be two sides, 
and to make peace you need two sides too. But the greatest 
blame must go to those who attacked us. We are defending our 
people and our land, and here we can see the international 
community's double-dealing. Instead of being neutral, the 
United Nations, too, has provided the Muslims with fuel and arms 
which were sent together with the humanitarian aid. 
  [Pellizzari] There is one village that you have always 
refrained from attacking. 
  [Mladic] Yes, Suni, where the Ustashas killed my father 
during World War II. I never found my father's grave. The 
majority of the population there are Muslims, but I never 
attacked those people. I would have been accused of wanting to 
take revenge for family reasons. 
  [Pellizzari] Sum up your biography in a few sentences. 
  [Mladic] I was born in Bosnia and I am like many other Serbs 
who were born there. I attended all the various military 
schools, and went through all the various ranks. But I have a 
tragic fate. Toward the end of the 20th century, I must use 
weapons to react against the extermination of my people. 
  [Pellizzari] You have a very bad reputation in the Western 
press. You are the symbol of ethnic cleansing. 
  [Mladic] I am aware of it. I am a general and I am more 
aware than others that war is a very dirty business. This word 
ought not even exist in human speech. Weapons are a terrible 
invention. I believe that even toy weapons ought to be 
forbidden throughout the world, from north to south. 
  [Pellizzari] If some day politicians decide that this war 
must end, that the embargo must be lifted, and that Mladic must 
step aside, what will you do then? 
  [Mladic] Politicians start wars, and generals carry them out 
-- it is like this everywhere. Again, it is politicians who 
decide when the moment has come to put an end to war. But this 
war's true warlords are to be found in the West. The Serbian 
people are awaiting their decisions. The fewer aircraft take 
off from UN bases, the easier will it become to achieve peace in 
this region. The key to the war lies in NATO's command. NATO is 
an alliance to defend its member countries, but no one here has 
ever threatened any of its member countries. 
  [Pellizzari] You place the Serbian nation above all other 
considerations. 
  [Mladic] There are two sacrosanct things in life: my country 
and my women. The soil and women bear life. In fact, only a 
few among them have any say in the battles waged between armies. 
Mrs. Thatcher wants to do so. She is helping the Croats and 
Muslims, this is why they are losing. After mothers, wives, and 
daughters, it is soldiers who most loathe war. 
  [Pellizzari] The conflict in Bosnia looks like a religious 
conflict. 
  [Mladic] Perhaps we Serbs are no better than others, but we 
are not any worse either. Nor are we a tennis ball that can be 
struck in all directions. Nor do we want to become like an 
Amazonian tribe on its way to extinction, or like a rare species 
confined to a reserve. Islam wants to penetrate into Europe, 
and the West will see it grow like a mushroom. However, I have 
always showed myself humane toward enemy soldiers. I may add 
that I have prevented the conflict from spreading. 
  [Pellizzari] How do you mean? 
  [Mladic] When shells start flying, they can fly in all 
directions, even very far from here. Toward the Pyrenees, 
toward Siberia. Let me remind you of the attempt in Sarajevo, 
in 1914. 
  [Pellizzari] Why do you prevail in battle? 
  [Mladic] I have a mind of my own, but I want no publicity. 
Ultimately, publicity does not allow you to live. Contrary to 
what is being said and written, I am not waging a war against 
the Croatian or the Muslim people. I am waging a war against 
their leaders, and against those instigating them from abroad. 
I respect my enemies, but I do not hate them. This is why I 
win.

  [Text] Zagreb, May 24 (AFP) -- Troops from the mainly 
Moslem Bosnian Government have stepped up attacks on Serb-held 
positions in northern Bosnia, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] 
spokesman Matthew Nerzig said Tuesday [24 May]. The spokesman 
said there were indications the fighting near Tesanj, a 
Moslem-held town, "could represent a significant increase in 
offensive actions" by the Bosnian Army. 
  A UN spokesman meanwhile said two Serb tanks had fired on 
Bosnian army positions within the UN-imposed heavy arms 
exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. The tanks 
reportedly "fired from Mazovici, just inside the total exclusion 
zone." UN military observers also reported "heavy shelling and 
fighting" around Maglaj, another Moslem town 15 kilometres (10 
miles) south of Tesanj. A spokesman surmised the fighting was 
"a possible attempt by the BiH (Bosnian Army) to gain ground 
west of the Maglaj pocket." 
  Further north, Brcko, under Serb control, had Monday 
experienced a second consecutive day of shelling believed to 
have been launched by Moslems. "There were 10 impacts recorded 
last night in Brcko," a UN spokesman said. "We have seen some 
significant shelling into Brcko and this is largely believed to 
be the shelling of the BiH side into the town." Unconfirmed 
reports suggested the shelling was designed to cut electricity 
supplies to Brcko, situated in a corridor linking Serb- held 
territory in Bosnia and Croatia to Serbia proper. Exchanges 
between Serb and Croat forces were also reported at Orasje, a 
Croat pocket of land northwest of Brcko. 
  Elsewhere, Bosnian troops shelled the northern Serb-held 
town 
of Doboj during Tuesday afternoon, causing damage, Belgrade's 
TANJUG news agency said. Doboj, with its population of 20,000, 
is an important regional rail hub. TANJUG said five people were 
injured in two rocket attacks on the town Monday.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 25 May carries in its 
regular 8-minute newscast several reports on the military 
situation in the republic over the last 24 hours. Reception is 
fair. 
  Reporting from Kalesija, Abdulah Ridjanovic says that 
"yesterday evening the entire commune came under attack, 
particularly from the direction of (Borogovo), from where 
(?Cetkovice), Gornji Rajinci, and Lazarevici were shelled with 
large-caliber howitzers. From the direction of (Dolina) and 
Djukanovic Brdo the enemy fired 82-mm mortars at Kalesija and 
the district of (Brdo). A fierce artillery attack was also 
launched from the infamous Mt. Majevica on (?Vozuca) and Gornja 
Hrasnica." 
  Muriz Kreho reports from Kladanj that "during the last 24 
hours the southern and southeastern parts on this front came 
under Chetnik artillery fire. From their strongholds in the 
temporarily occupied areas of Olovo, Han Pijesak, and Vlasenica, 
the Chetniks pounded our defense positions east of Karaula with 
howitzers, tanks, and mortars. Their long-range artillery also 
targeted the center of Kladanj. Dozens of large-caliber shells 
were fired between 1620 and 2000, but fortunately there were no 
casualties." 
  Describing the situation in Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that 
"during the night the united [Serbian and Fikret Abdic's 
paramilitaries] aggressor kept firing with small arms and 
antiaircraft weapons in the entire theater of operations of the 
5th Corps and the HVO [Croatian Defense Council]. On several 
occasions they shelled the defensive positions on the 
Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau. During the night several artillery 
shells were fired at Cazin and the outskirts of Bihac, while 
members of Abdic's traitor paramilitaries attempted an infantry 
breakthrough at Pecigrad." 
  Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "over the last 24 
hours the Serbian aggressor fired with small arms, trying to 
provoke the defenders' response. Yesterday evening the 
aggressor fired a dozen 82-mm mortars from (Rogozar) at 
(Jagodnjak). Our fighters, who have suffered no losses during 
the last 24 hours, did not respond to the enemy fire."

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 24 May carries in its 
regular newscast two reports on the fighting in the republic. 
  Mirudin Aldobasic reports from the 7th South Operative Group 
press center and says that "throughout the day, the chetniks 
from Mount Ozren shelled the village of Mravici on the Doboj 
front. As reprisal for all the defeats that the Serbian rebels 
are suffering, they shelled civilians and residential areas. 
They fired several hundred shells at (?Planje), [name 
indistinct], Dobro Polje, Mrkopic, and the center of Tesanj. On 
several occasions between 1500 and 1700, on almost all of the 
separation lines, particularly on the Tesanj and [name 
indistinct], the enemy used chemical agents. However, the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army members are in absolute control of the 
situation in this region." 
  Gorazde correspondent Mustafa Kurtovic reports that "the day 
was again marked by serious Serbo-Montenegrin fascist 
provocations within the three kilometer exclusion zone. In the 
course of the day, at a distance of only 500 meters from the 
town center, in the district of Vara, two women were seriously 
wounded by snipers. This again confirms the impotence of the UN 
peace forces in Gorazde. The aggressor was not quiet in the 20 
kilometer exclusion zone. He fired howitzer shells at the 
villages of Brdarici and [name indistinct]. There were small 
arms and antiaircraft provocations on the 
Ostanica-Ilovaca-Orahovice defense line. The criminals from the 
Vuk and Grah plateaus are constantly firing at the villages of 
Mravnjak, Potrkusa, Djindjici, Vranice, and Perjani. They are 
using antiaircraft machine guns, M-84 machine guns, sniper 
rifles, and portable rocket launchers."

  [Text] Doboj, May 24 (TANJUG) -- Moslems and Croats on 
Tuesday afternoon [24 May] attacked Serb positions on all 
sections of the front from Doboj in the north of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, through central Bosnia-Herzegovina, to the 
line of delimitation in the area of Nevesinje in the south of 
this former Yugoslav republic, Bosnian Serb military sources 
said on Tuesday evening. Armed forces of Bosnian Croats, the 
Croatian Defense Council -- HVO, joined the Moslem forces with 
their tanks and attacked Serb positions in central Bosnia, 
REUTERS said on Tuesday evening, quoting sources of the United 
Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia. 
  Bosnian Croat forces are actively helping Moslem troops 
against the local Serbs, REUTERS reported from Sarajevo. Two 
Croat T-55 tanks and HVO troops attacked Serb positions in a 
joint action southwest of Tesanj, REUTERS said. Two M-84 tanks 
also took part in this operation which began on Monday morning, 
said REUTERS quoting the same source. 
  Moslems forces are attacking serb defense positions and 
villages in fronts in the wider area of Doboj. In the afternoon 
hours, Moslems shelled Doboj and Serb villages and positions 
west of this town. 
  The Serb forces returned strong fire and neutralized the 
enemy operations. 
  On the front southeast of Teslic (south of Doboj), Moslem 
units have been trying to penetrate the Serb defense lines for 
days. 
  Moslems are speedily building up their forces south and 
southwest of Serb positions near Mt. Ozren (south of Doboj), the 
First Krajina corps of the Bosnian Serb Army said. United 
forces of the HVO and regular Croatian Army units on Tuesday 
fired several shells at Serb positions in the area of Gradine, 
on the front near Nevesinje (south of Mostar), TANJUG reported 
from Bileca on Tuesday evening, quoting a statement by the 
Herzegovina corps of the Bosnian Serb Army. The source also 
said that Serb fighters answered the attack, thus silencing the 
Croat guns.

  [Text] Zvornik, May 24 (TANJUG) -- Tensions are rising 
between the Bosnian Croats and Moslems, who dispute over 
territories in many parts of Bosnia, said sources close to the 
top-level officials of the Bosnian Serb army (VRS). The sources 
specify that tensions are most intense in central Bosnia, in the 
regions of Mostar, Gornji Vakuf, Prozor, Vitez and Vares. 
Moslems and Croats have obstructed the transport of 
humanitarian aid, banned refugees to return, and made many other 
similar actions. 
  The Bosnian Moslems and Croats continued fierce fighting 
during the last year for the territories with mixed population 
in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina until they abruptly 
reconciled in March. The Serb side has learned about more 
frequent Moslem-Croat armed incidents, which threaten with 
conflagration of war. Material destruction of facilities, 
including religious buildings, continues on both sides. 
  It is pointed out that, despite preparations of both 
leaderships to solemnly inaugurate a new Moslem federation on 
May 30, agreed under strong U.S. pressure, both people and local 
authorities of the two sides are becoming convinced that it is 
impossible to live in a new community. Both Moslems and Croats 
secretly pile up food, fuel and ammunition reserves. 
  In such a situation, the U.N. peacekeeping forces do their 
best to prevent atrocities and large-scale clashes from 
spreading and intensifying which could annihilate the Washington 
accord on a Moslem-Croat federation, the VRS sources say. The 
sources point out thtat inter-Moslem clashes continue in the 
autonomous province of western Bosnia (APZB), in the far west of 
the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is 
estimated that these clashes may escalate. The APZB was 
proclaimed by advocates of a peaceful settlement in Bosnia. 
  It was pointed out that units loyal to the Moslem government 
in Sarajevo have massively displaced population from the 
outlying sections towards the APZB. This fact is more than an 
obvious sign that forces loyal to the Moslem leadership in 
Sarajevo will launch a large-scale attack against the defenders 
of the APZB, the VRS military sources explain.

  [Text] The Information Service of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army 1st Corps has issued a statement saying that the enemy is 
still attacking on the Visoko, Vares, and Breza fronts. The 
Chetniks have been pounding Visoko from their positions in 
Dolipolje, Kriva, Jelica, and Siljak. The Vares area has also 
been exposed to heavy artillery fire, particularly the defense 
lines in (Mesevicko Brdo) the villages of Rokoc, [words 
indistinct], and the town itself. The aggressor has been using 
his entire artillery arsenal in these attacks, including 
howitzers, tanks, mortars, heavy guns, and antiaircraft guns and 
machine guns, from his positions in Brezac, Jeljani, [words 
indistinct]. 
  Several Chetnik infantry attacks on the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army positions have been routed, but the enemy plans to continue 
to attack the free territory. This is [words indistinct] 
bringing in new forces and digging in. All these attacks and 
preparations have been under way in the exclusion zone, says the 
Army Press Center, and adds that -- considering such an indolent 
attitude of the UN Protection Forces -- the fighters and the 
units of our army are even more determined in their defense.

  [Text] Warsaw, 24 May -- Polish Republic President Lech 
Walesa had lunch at his residence with Sejm Speaker Jozef 
Oleksy, the president's press office reported today. They 
discussed the country's defense and security matters, the role 
of the Armed Forces supreme commander, and the need for a 
parliamentary debate on the issues with the participation of the 
president. 
  These matters should be discussed at the coming meeting of 
the National Defense Committee. It was also considered 
important that mechanisms be defined for political consultations 
on the security of the state. 
  The speaker also briefed the president on the parliament's 
agenda in the immediate future, before the summer recess. 
  Within the framework of the coordination of Polish foreign 
policy between the highest state authorities, the speaker 
discussed his planned visit to China, the communique says.

<F P=106> [Report by Luiza Kowalska: "Walesa Maneuvered KOK To Gain </F>
Time?"] 
  [Text]Where will the president look for support for 
his vision of subordinating the chief of the General Staff? The 
biggest political parties refuse to accept the solution being 
proposed by Walesa, by saying they will not succumb to bribery 
attempts. 
  The government has failed to decide whether the chief of the 
General Staff should be subordinate to the president or to the 
national defense minister. 
  President Walesa, who is in favor of the former option, has 
suggested that the government postpone a decision on the issue 
and give the National Defense Committee [KOK] a chance to speak. 
"There were no conflicts between us" -- Walesa explained to 
journalists and left the Council of Ministers' Office after 12 
minutes. 
  KOK (which is not defined by the Constitution but only by 
the 
law on popular defense obligation) will most probably meet next 
Wednesday. On the committee are: the president, the prime 
minister, Sejm and Senate speakers, chiefs of the Defense 
Ministry [MON], the Foreign Ministry, and the Internal Affairs 
Ministry, the finance minister, chief of the National Security 
Bureau, and chief of the President's Office. KOK's decisions 
are not binding on the government. 
  It is not clear whether supporting the president's idea 
would 
require an amendment to the Small Constitution. According to 
the Constitution, the president is the supreme commander of the 
Armed Forces. He also appoints and recalls the chief of the 
General Staff, in agreement with MON's chief. It is only the 
law that provides specific rules on the General Staff chief's 
subordination to the national defense minister. 
  "There are no obstacles against providing in the law that 
the 
chief of the General Staff should be subordinate to the 
president. Such a change does not require a constitutional 
amendment" -- says Lech Falandysz, deputy chief of the 
President's Office. 
  Whether it is going to be a change of the law or of the 
Small 
Constitution, it is not very likely that the Sejm would support 
the president's proposal. A majority of parties support the 
other option, under which the president oversees the Army 
through the national defense minister. 
  So it cannot be ruled out that by making a motion for a KOK 
meeting, the president wanted to delay the government's ultimate 
decision and, in the meantime, gain support for his proposal. 
ZYCIE WARSZAWY asked some Sejm deputies what president could 
use to bribe the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD]: 
  "I cannot see anything in return for which we would be 
willing to support the president's idea. This issue is 
non-negotiable" -- stated SLD's Zbigniew Siemiatkowski. 
"Perhaps the president will try to tempt us, but with what? I 
really have no idea." 
  A Sejm deputy for PSL holds a similar view. "I do not think 
that there is anything that one could offer in exchange for our 
support for the president's proposal. At any rate, no such 
offer has been made to us. Defense policies are not the best 
area for making deals" -- says Janusz Piechocinski.

  [Text] Warsaw, 24 May -- A comprehensive assessment of the 
course of implementation of the Polish Republic Armed Forces' 
restructuring has been the main topic of a meeting of the Joint 
Armed Forces commanders. During the two-day meeting chaired by 
Chief of General Staff General Tadeusz Wilecki, the participants 
watched the "Karat 94" tactical and combat exercise at Wicko 
Morskie range, a communique by the general staff's spokesman 
says. 
  The second part of the meeting was held at the Navy Command 
Headquarters in Gdynia, where members of the General Staff heard 
reports by military district commanders and navy commanders on 
restructuring in the subordinated units and military 
institutions. 
  The members of the Joint Armed Forces Commanders were 
briefed 
on a general outline for the functioning of the logistics system 
in the spheres of service, maintenance, and army supply. New 
principles for gathering reserves of military equipment and 
materials were also discussed, the communique reads.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ewa Spychalska, chairperson of the </F>
All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, by Pawel Reszka: date and 
place not given -- "Deceived A Little"] 
  [Text] [Reszka] Under what conditions are you leaving the 
All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] at the end of your term 
in office? 
  [Spychalska] The fundamental task that was assigned to me 
when I was elected chairperson was to maintain and to 
consolidate the organization; to improve its image and extend 
support for it. The union did win new supporters. During my 
tenure, as many as 11 new structures and over 350,000 new 
members joined the union. Today we have 4,782,000 unionists. 
However, many unionists have left us, particularly as a 
consequence of transformations and layoffs. 
  [Reszka] Did the union become stronger when it was under 
your leadership? 
  [Spychalska] Strength is not reflected merely in the number 
of members. We learned how to negotiate and hold talks. We 
have increasingly better and stronger arguments. 
  [Reszka] These successes are not easily seen where the 
Charter of Social Guarantees is concerned, for instance. You 
started to talk about it with the Suchocka government and there 
are still no effects. 
  [Spychalska] The negotiations on the charter really started 
in February of this year; however, they have been going on for 
too long anyway. The stand of the unionists is not adamant 
enough, and the government is prolonging the talks; it is not 
making any definite measures or clear declarations. I am 
getting the impression that the government is afraid of 
solutions, that it is afraid to make decisions of a political 
nature. 
  [Reszka] Did you expect so many problems with the 
government, which includes so many of your political colleagues? 
  [Spychalska] I knew that things would not be easy -- I was 
aware of the situation. I thought, however, that they would 
have more courage and determination. 
  [Reszka] Before the elections, the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD] was rather certain of its economic program. Do you feel 
that it is not hurrying to implement it? 
  [Spychalska] Yes, I do. Especially as far as the equal 
starting point for both sectors of the economy is concerned; 
this is found not only in the program of SLD, but also in the 
program of the entire governing coalition. This was a primary 
issue. 
  [Reszka] I understand that it has not been put into effect. 
However, before the government was formed, you formidably 
announced that you would not give up even one item in the SLD 
election program. 
  [Spychalska] This is still the case. 
  [Reszka] This program includes a few dozen pages full of 
promises... 
  [Spychalska] ...plans that were supposed to be put into 
effect. What causes friction is the fact that even though we 
signed the program, we bear joint responsibility for it, and we 
are already paying the price for being in the coalition, there 
is still no four- year schedule for the implementation of the 
program. 
  [Reszka] What price are you paying for being in SLD? 
  [Spychalska] Sometimes our members are dissatisfied that 
everything is proceeding too slowly and that the government has 
no clear policy. 
  [Reszka] Still, your unionists are still favorably disposed 
toward the government? 
  [Spychalska] Their views are now much more moderate than 
they were at the beginning. 
  [Reszka] You have travelled extensively outside Warsaw prior 
to the congress. Have the unionists asked you about the various 
promises, such as stimulating the housing sector, lifting the 
popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases], full implementation 
of the "Pact on Enterprise..." 
  [Spychalska] These were the most important issues at those 
meetings and they will come back at the congress. 
  [Reszka] But how did you respond to the unionists? 
  [Spychalska] (after a moment of silence) Well..., I 
presented the actual state of affairs to them. That is, the 
state of affairs that is within the parliament -- because this 
is what I know; what the government is doing -- I do not know. 
  [Reszka] You do not know what the government is doing? 
  [Spychalska] Well, I do not, I have problems. I only know 
what the government has sent over to me in order to consult me 
on those issues. Therefore, I can guess that this is what the 
ministers may deal with next. 
  [Reszka] The evaluation of the situation is not very good, 
then. It is worth recalling that in September last year you 
said that you would give the government three to six months of 
peace: "We will be trustful and restrained." Will a war with 
the government break out after the six months? 
  [Spychalska] The government had six months to prepare the 
budget; however, it also should have used this time to prepare 
the foundations for the implementation of the election program. 
But this is still missing. This issue may be discussed quite 
sharply at the congress. 
  [Reszka] Does this mean that it does not pay for OPZZ to be 
in SLD? 
  [Spychalska] It generally does not pay for unionists to be 
in the Sejm. We were already convinced about that in the 
previous Sejm; however, the political situation was not stable 
enough for us to be able to conclude a political contract with 
the party: implementation of the program in return for support. 
I believe, however, that the presence of unionists will not be 
necessary in the next Sejm. 
  [Reszka] Talking about contracts. As far as privatization 
is concerned, do you find your views closer to those of Sejm 
Deputy Pek or Minister Kaczmarek? 
  [Spychalska] Well... middle of the road, more or less. We 
do not definitely oppose privatization; however, neither are we 
supporters of everything being for sale, of such a "total 
privatization." No extremes. 
  [Reszka] You have talked about future political contracts. 
However, you already concluded a certain contract when you 
entered the structures of SLD. Do you feel deceived? 
  [Spychalska] I feel disappointed. This program kept all of 
us together. The fact that it is not being implemented has put 
the coalition under question. 
  [Reszka] What is OPZZ going to do, then? 
  [Spychalska] The congress will set the specific dates. The 
most fundamental issue is a social agreement which must include 
a clear schedule of the implementation of the program. There is 
a chance to sign the Charter of Social Guarantees very soon. I 
think that at that time, the government will get not more than 
two or three months for the preparation of a clear schedule. If 
that is not done, it will mean that our presence in the 
coalition just does not make sense. 
  [Reszka] Perhaps the SLD program was too simple? You spoke 
about stimulating the economy very soon, about tariffs, tax 
police... It turns out that it all cannot be achieved fast. 
  [Spychalska] Indeed, it cannot be achieved fast. There are 
many factors, including the international ones... Sometimes the 
prescriptions were too simple indeed; however, this is a 
characteristic of an election campaign. One should draw 
conclusions from this. Resorting to oversimplifications is very 
often disastrous. People interpret well the information that 
they want and they demand that it be put into effect. 
  [Reszka] Do you admit to mistakes? Do you think there were 
things you could have done better? 
  [Spychalska] Yes, I do. A large part of the SLD program was 
prepared by Marek Borowski. He was the economic guru of this 
group and we trusted him. I sometimes read this program because 
I have one copy of it, with the signature of Borowski. When he 
was still deputy prime minister and we could not reach an 
agreement, I would show this program to him and say: "These are 
your own words and we believed you." Today we feel a little 
deceived. 
  [Reszka] What would he answer? 
  [Spychalska] "Well, you know, it was a campaign, it is only 
a program; I thought, but when I came here the situation was 
more difficult..." 
  [Reszka] You are expressing unfavorable opinions about the 
government, the coalition. Is this the election campaign before 
the congress already? 
  [Spychalska] No, it is not. These are facts. I am still a 
supporter of the idea of negotiations. I would only like the 
other side to treat this as we do. It is not because the 
congress is drawing near that I am criticizing the government. 
  [Reszka] Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of the Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP], is publicly supporting 
you. 
  [Spychalska] He is not a delegate. His statements are ill- 
timed, too early, and moreover, out of place, which I have told 
him. 
  [Reszka] Why do you think you are a comfortable person for 
him? 
  [Spychalska] Go ask him! He will not corroborate the thesis 
about my "being comfortable." He has enough troubles talking 
with me. 
  [Reszka] Perhaps he would have even more troubles with 
someone else? 
  [Spychalska] Perhaps..., but not necessarily, because people 
often take rather adamant stands when they are not parties to a 
conflict. Then they relent. I am just the way I am and I will 
not change. I think that one of the features of my character is 
that I am able to listen. This makes the other side trust and 
respect me. 
  [Reszka] Spychalska belongs to the "Gray" (the seat of SdRP 
-- editor's note), I learned from one unionist... 
  [Spychalska] (laughs) I am surprised. This was probably in 
the context of that statement by Kwasniewski. I come across 
many statements of the "Gray" which criticize me for being too 
independent. 
  I think, therefore, that as far as my "belonging to the 
Gray" 
is concerned, the situation is rather quite the contrary. 
  [Reszka] Is OPZZ not too dispersed? The heads of the 
branches reach agreements without the head of the center. Does 
this not place OPZZ in the position of a group of several dozen 
persons who do not have much influence on unionists? 
  [Spychalska] I do not think it is a mistake. The advantage 
of the movement is the fact that it consists of branches and 
that the branches are independent. We have chosen this form of 
activity on purpose: independent branches and the serving role 
of the center. I would not feel good in a union governed by a 
structure based on commands. This structure works to our 
advantage. 
  [Reszka] You want to sign a social agreement and you cannot 
order unionists to do anything. Are you a serious partner for 
the government? 
  [Spychalska] Yes, we are. We can reach a consensus without 
issuing orders. 
  [Reszka] I have heard the opinion that the OPZZ heads who 
are simultaneously Sejm deputies do not have much time left for 
unionists. 
  [Spychalska] This is a fact and the most fundamental 
accusation. Out of six persons who are in the OPZZ leadership, 
five are deputies. These proportions should be more balanced. 
However, there are also extreme views: that the function of 
heading the union should not be merged with being a Sejm deputy. 
I am a supporter of balancing these proportions in the 
leadership: a group for contacts with the parliament, the 
government, and a group for contacts with the unionists. 
  [Reszka] So far, no one has publicly announced that he or 
she would like to compete with you at the congress. Are you 
that strong? Are your competitors afraid of you? 
  [Spychalska] I do not think that there are any elements of 
fear there. Nor do I think that I am that strong. I could 
point to seven or eight persons who would be excellent 
substitutes. I am aware of the fact that various meetings of 
bigger and smaller groups are being held. This is only normal. 
However, no one has come to me and said: "Listen, I want to run 
as well." This would be nice. When I decided to run for the 
post of the deputy chairperson, I came and said it. 
  [Reszka] How many opponents in the elections will you have? 
  [Spychalska] Three, I think. 
  [Reszka] Do you predict a difficult fight. 
  [Spychalska] I certainly do. 
  [Reszka] Are you going to win? 
  [Spychalska] I do not know. I am not superstitious, but 
this is just not certain. I think that there will not be a 
total attack. 
  [Reszka] How are you going to persuade the delegates that it 
is you who should be elected? 
  [Spychalska] The bargaining chip will be the concept of 
labor organization. 
  [Reszka] It is so marvelous that you will be elected. 
  [Spychalska] I do not think that it is so extraordinary, but 
it certainly is rational from my point of view. 
  [Reszka] What will you do if you lose? 
  [Spychalska] I have received many offers for interesting 
work -- that is not a problem. Two of them are very interesting 
indeed: one concerns work in the banking sector, and the other 
-- in journalism. It will not be a post in the government. 
  [Reszka] Will you leave OPZZ? 
  [Spychalska] I certainly will. I am not going to inflict 
myself there. 
  [Reszka] If you win, what will change in OPZZ? 
  [Spychalska] The organization of work. The style of the 
work of the center and of the units subordinated to it is a 
little slow. It must be an organism that reacts fast. This 
calls for statutory changes.

<F P=106> [Article by Agata Nowakowska: "Alone, or With SLD?; Before </F>
OPZZ Congress"] 
  [Text]To be with the government, or just next to it? 
-- A few days before a congress by the All-Poland Trade Unions 
Agreement [OPZZ], there are two views clashing in the trade 
union: Wisniewski says: "Let us create our own trade union club 
in the Sejm," while Manicki says: "Let us continue to stick 
with the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]." 
  Shortly after the government was formed, OPZZ Chairwoman Ewa 
Spychalska made threatening statements to the effect that she 
will not give even an umbrella handle to Pawlak's government. 
But now OPZZ firmly stands behind the government. 
  OPZZ remembers well what happened to "Solidarity" -- an 
attempt to elude the responsibility for "Solidarity"-derived 
governments, ended in bringing Suchocka's cabinet down. 
"Solidarity" paid an enormous price for that. 
  But OPZZ's rank and file like the idea of sticking to the 
Polish Peasant Party and the Social Democracy of the Polish 
Republic [SdRP] less and less: The government does not 
listen to us. We are helpless. OPZZ does not have its own 
ministers but we sure get a kick in the pants when the 
government does something wrong -- such opinions were 
voiced during Spychalska's meeting with the rank and file in 
May. Spychalska toured the country before the OPZZ congress. 
She intends to run for chairwoman again. 
<H5>  Time for Own Label </H5>
  OPZZ Deputy Chairman Stanislaw Wisniewski thinks that it is 
time for the trade union's own label. He wants to suggest to 
the congress that a divorce with SdRP take place, followed by 
the establishment of the trade union's own deputies club in the 
Sejm. Over 460 delegates will make a decision on that shortly. 
  Wisniewski was the only one to be in favor of a protest 
against the government's version of the budget. He was thrown 
out of SLD for that. Now, he intends to run for OPZZ chairman. 
  Would a farewell to the coalition be the trade union's 
success? 
  Wisniewski thinks it would. The advantage gained would be 
"going about freely," without the constraints of the club's 
voting discipline. Attempts to force trade unionists to act 
this or that way -- as in the case of the budget, or popiwek 
[enterprise tax on above-normative pay] -- would never happen 
again. 
  Wisniewski's idea for an efficient OPZZ is about making a 
"yardstick" out of the trade union. He thinks that the 
coalition, after it is weakened by the trade unionists' 
departure, would have to make efforts to gain OPZZ's support in 
the Sejm. 
  But even without the trade unionists, the coalition enjoys a 
majority in the Sejm. There are 60 trade unionists among the 
298 "governmental" Sejm deputies. On top of that, a majority of 
the trade union's members prefer to be under the protective 
wings of SLD, and they are not very eager to establish a weak 
little club. 
<H5>  Suicidal Secession </H5>
  Will Wisniewski succeed at the congress? It is not very 
likely. It seems that a majority of OPZZ members think along the 
same lines as Maciej Manicki, another deputy chairman (he has no 
intention of running for OPZZ chairman) who is opposed to such a 
secession: 
  That would be suicide. Even if the congress decided to 
sever OPZZ's ties with SLD, 30 Sejm deputies would leave, at the 
most -- Manicki says. 
  In his view, "Solidarity" was able to shift the balance of 
votes in the Sejm of the previous term because Suchocka's 
government was a minority one, whereas the coalition now in 
power does not need OPZZ that badly at all. 
  Manicki is aware that among the rank and file, not everybody 
is happy with the OPZZ-SdRP alliance. But to leave SLD 
altogether would weaken our efficiency even more -- he 
says. So far, we succeeded in blocking, for instance, the 
popiwek. 
<H5>  Bound by Fear </H5>
  According to Aleksander Kwasniewski, an SLD leader, the idea 
of OPZZ leaving SLD has no chances whatsoever of materializing. 
Both groups are strongly tied to one another by the fear of a 
defeat by the postcommunists. 
  While Wisniewski speaks about the trade union's excessive 
concessions, Kwasniewski speaks about OPZZ paying back its debt 
-- it is thanks to SdRP that there are so many trade 
unionists/Sejm deputies in the Sejm. The SdRP leader has his 
own reliable men in the trade union and he is hoping that Ewa 
Spychalska -- his positive heroine -- will be reelected OPZZ 
chairwoman. 
<H5>  A Roundtable With "Solidarity" </H5>
  OPZZ chiefs differ on their positions vis-a-vis the 
government but they are united on a dream of friendship with 
"Solidarity": The government is just a government and 
there is a whole river separating it from trade unions. We 
should build a bridge across the river along with 
"Solidarity" -- Wisniewski says. Only together, can 
we maneuver the government out. Manicki has similar views. 
He thinks that both trade unions have the same demands and they 
represent the interests of the same people. 
  Wisniewski is an enthusiast of a "trade union round table" 
session during which decisions would be made on what to fight 
for together, and how. In the meantime, the old divisions 
between OPZZ and "Solidarity" remain. Joint measures are not 
undertaken. It is easy to win with "Solidarity" when it goes it 
alone, and the government wins with OPZZ equally easily: First 
it makes promises, then it forgets them. 
  According to Wisniewski, OPZZ has made several attempts at 
reconciliation with "Solidarity," which ignored the moves. But 
OPZZ is also to blame, to some extent. Failure to support 
"Solidarity"s strikes was a mistake. 
  Recently, Manicki made an offer to "Solidarity" for a joint 
strategy for defending a demand coming from trade unions 
concerning a 40-hour work week. There was no reply, either. 
  A decision on which option will prevail -- to go it alone, 
or 
to continue to stick to SLD -- will be made at the OPZZ congress 
in a few days.

<F P=106> [Report by "W.Z." from Krakow: "BBWR Is Getting Closer To a </F>
Party Formula; 300 Million Zlotys For Everybody Still on Agenda"] 
  [Text]A two-day program conference of the Non-Party 
Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR] has ended in Krakow. BBWR's 
leadership announced a transformation of the group into a 
political party. The final decision will be made at a congress 
of the organization which will be held in the fall. 
  BBWR's First Program Conference was supposed to work out a 
concept of political and economic changes in the country but in 
practice, it showed dilemmas that the entire group is facing 
with the upcoming elections for the post of president of the 
Republic of Poland. That BBWR's concept is different from that 
of the President's Office, is best demonstrated by the fact that 
practically nobody from among high ranking Belvedere 
officials took part in the substantive debate. When asked 
about BBWR's candidates in the upcoming presidential elections, 
Professor Zbigniew Religa replied laconically: As long as 
Lech Walesa does not make a decision to run, there is nobody we 
could support. But if our economic concepts are substantially 
different from the president's program principles, then we will 
propose our own candidate. A program for Poland -- which was 
debated during the Krakow session -- covers, among others, a 
draft of a new constitution based on a 
presidential-parliamentary system of power, speeding up of 
self-governmental reforms, enfranchisement of citizens in the 
form of a complete and popular privatization, defining the 
state's position on foreign capital taking into account the 
interests of national economy, as well as devoting higher 
amounts of money to the education system and civic 
education. 
  Professor Jerzy Eysymontt, chief of the BBWR Parliamentary 
Club, was asked by NOWA EUROPA about whether economic slogans 
declared during the election campaign proclaiming 300 million 
zlotys for each citizen, are still valid. His response was: 
We are in favor of a popular enfranchisement, and 
everything that leads to a complete privatization of the economy 
will be supported by us, and that is why we still think that the 
300 million zlotys which we proposed in the election campaign, 
is a slogan under which important parts of the national wealth 
should be transferred over to citizens.

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Krasowski and Piotr Smilowicz: "The </F>
Power of Stereotypes; Politicians of All Parties Complain About 
Their Members' Social Image"] 
  [Text] We present the second part of a poll which we have 
conducted among leaders of the main Polish political parties. 
We asked them about their perception of their parties' rank and 
files, and how -- in their view -- that perception is different 
from popular stereotypes. 
  When one speaks about an average member of the Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP], "comrade Szmaciak" 
appears. He is a former low-level apparatchik who was removed 
from power for a few years; he is the incompetent and dishonest 
activist type, driven by career ambitions and by revenge on 
"Solidarity" activists. 
  "Comrade Szmaciak is total nonsense" -- says an irritated 
Aleksander Kwasniewski. 
  In his view, there are Szmaciaks in all the parties and so 
they are not exclusive to SdRP only. Sometimes they are called 
"comrade Szmaciak," at other times -- "colleague Szmaciak," and 
even "most reverend Szmaciak." Besides, nobody could have 
predicted when joining SdRP in 1990 that the party would assume 
power so soon. 
  But Kwasniewski refuses to talk about his idea of an average 
member of his party: 
  "In a 60,000-member organization, it is hard to talk about 
an 
average member" -- the SdRP chairman says. 
  But he adds that it must be someone 35 to 50, from a city in 
a majority of cases, and educated. Such average members are not 
easily distinguishable in a crowd. They do not wear white socks 
since they do not belong to that kind of generation anymore. At 
the most, they wear slightly worn suits since, often, they are 
not very well off financially. 
  Wincenty Stawarz, acting chairman of the Polish Peasant 
Party, provided the following description of an average peasant 
activist (after having thought for five minutes and after having 
asked us not to delete anything from what he says): 
  "He is very active in social issues, he is closely tied to 
the interests of the countryside and agriculture. He is 
patriotic, with a strong and independent Poland being the most 
important thing to him. He is attached to his family, he 
regards work as an element of moral education, he values good 
work and he expects honest pay for such work. He is religious 
and close to the Church." 
  Stawarz thinks that the stereotype of a peasant activist 
wearing white socks amounts to a distasteful making a laughing 
stock out of rural areas and people living there. But he admits 
that sometimes, peasant activists can be distinguished in a 
crowd. 
  "But some gentlemen with coats of arms behave even worse at 
times" -- he adds. "Sometimes peasant activists are not 'on the 
same level' as people from cities, but this applies only to 
those who make their living by farming. Contact with the land 
and with animals are not very conducive to good manners, but 
they are still good" -- Stawarz adds emphatically. 
  Jaroslaw Kaczynski is outraged when one suggests to him the 
following vision of an average member of the Center Accord [PC]: 
A frustrated and power-hungry activist who uses revolutionary 
rhetoric. 
  "That kind of stereotype was created by our enemies" -- 
Kaczynski says. "PC's first program declaration of 1990 was 
very moderate and one certainly cannot describe it as 
'revolutionary rhetoric.'" 
  But the PC chairman does not deny that the image of his 
party 
created by the mass media is responsible for the fact that many 
people found their way into the party who in some way conform 
with the notion of a stereotype PC member. 
  "Members of PC come first of all from the first-generation 
intelligentsia. There are many people with the status of an 
intelligentsia member despite not having a higher education. 
These are people who since 1980 were active in 'Solidarity' and 
that is what enabled their social advancement." 
  Kaczynski adds that lack of a communist past is a common 
trait displayed by members of PC: 
  "Most of the members are people who 'fought the system at 
the 
lowest level' in the period of the Polish People's Republic. 
We have just a handful of former members of the Polish United 
Workers Party" -- Kaczynski says. 
  He laments relatively few young people being PC members. 
"But that is a trait of all Polish political parties" -- he 
concludes. 
  "Among members of the Christian-National Union [ZChN], a 
majority are young people, with a majority of regional chiefs 
being 20-something or 30-something" -- says Ryszard Czarnecki, 
ZChN's spokesman. 
  In his view, a typical ZChN member is a student or a young 
member of the intelligentsia, "in most cases, he reads Roman 
Dmowski's publications," or else he is someone elderly, a 
Catholic who espouses national values. 
  "The stereotype of a ZChN member as a fanatic Catholic, is a 
snout that has been affixed to us" -- Czarnecki is outraged. 
"Of course, a majority of our members are believers. But there 
is a group of people who regard Catholicism as an important part 
of the Polish national tradition while not being religiously 
involved themselves." 
  Czarnecki perceives ZChN members as people of a cheery 
disposition who like to have fun: "Abstinence from alcohol is 
such a rare phenomenon among us, that it is even admired when it 
does happen." 
  In Czarnecki's view, the stereotype of ZChN members being 
violent and nervous, is also false: "A majority of our members 
are quiet and sedate kind of people" -- ZChN's spokesman says.

<F P=106> [Report by (APW): "New Offer of Designers from Gliwice; To </F>
Help the Infantry"] 
  [Text] The prototype is supposed to be ready at the end of 
this year. For the time being, it remains only an offer from 
the Development and Research Center of Mechanical Devices 
[OBRUM] in Gliwice. What is important, however, is that it will 
not be simply art for art's sake. At the third conference 
devoted to the problems of armament, held in Rydzyna, Wojciech 
Zajler, one of the designers of the new Polish infantry vehicle, 
pointed out that the vehicle is being prepared in close 
cooperation with "a military decision- maker." 
  At the request of the Army, the new combat armored vehicle 
[BWP] is supposed to resemble the T-72 tank. Even though the 
Gliwice designers believe that it will not be an "optimum 
structure" as a result, they take the Army's opinion into 
account. This compromise has very real economic dimensions, 
both in the present difficult financial situation and in the 
immediate future, which will probably be equally difficult. The 
same spare parts as in the tank as well as similar crew training 
will certainly have tremendous influence on the price of the 
entire undertaking. 
  It is clear that the Army would like to have something new, 
something that would be in line with the present development 
trends; however, they would like to achieve that for the lowest 
possible price. The offer of OBRUM may make that possible. 
  However, there is one snag in the entire affair. As a matter 
of fact, the Army would like to have a BWP with an armour 
thickness of between 10 and 60 millimeters; in addition, the 
military would like it to be amphibious as well. This is not 
possible, said the designers in Gliwice and therefore, their new 
proposal consists of... two offers. 
<H5>  BWP-94 </H5>
  This is the one that should meet the requirement of strong 
armor and strong power in general. The engine and the 
transmission are identical to those in the T-72 tank; however, 
the mechanisms were moved to the front. Two gearboxes (the same 
that are found in the tank) were located on both sides and 
linked coaxially to the drive wheels of the track system. 
Between the engine and the gearbox there is supposed to be 
generator starter, also of the T-72 tank type. The designers 
changed the indirect transmission crankcase, due to the 
necessity of adjusting it to front-wheel drive. 
  On the left side behind the engine there is room for the 
driver. On the right side are the radiators and the fans. The 
exhaust system is connected into the outlet radiator air channel. 
  On the central part of the frame is mounted a turret with 
the 
main armament. In the rear there is room for eight soldiers, 
sitting back-to-back in two rows. In front of each soldier, in 
the side panels, is a narrow firing slot. On the rear there is 
a loading platform. It opens hydraulically and contains two 
smaller hatches for soldiers. 
  The drive mechanism consists of six geared wheels, fixed on 
cranks. All this, including the tracks, are just as on the 
tank. The vehicle's suspension consists of coiled torsion bars. 
  The armament of the BWP-94 is supposed to be made up of a 
35- 
millimeter gun ("Oerlikona") located in a two-man tower. Placed 
coaxially to it is a 7.62-millimeter gun and 12.7-millimeter NSW 
plot above the tower. The design also provides for PPK 
launchers above the tower. 
  The combat weight of this 11-person vehicle is supposed to 
be 
approximately 30 tons. It is anticipated that its range will be 
500 kilometers and with a maximum speed of 65 kilometers per 
hour. 
  It will be 6.7 meters long and 2.3 meters high. The width 
between the tracks is supposed to be 3.37 meters, and ground 
clearance -- 0.45 meter. 
  It is planned that it will be equipped with a fire-fighting 
and anti-explosion Deugra system. Communications is supposed to 
be maintained by means of: an R-173 radio transmitter, an R-173 
radio receiver, and an R-124 radio telephone. 
<H5>  BWP Amphibian </H5>
  Due to the requirement of floatability, the parameters of 
this offer of OBRUM are entirely different. The combat weight 
of the vehicle is "only" 17.3 tons; the thickness of the armor 
-- from 6 to 10 millimeters. It has room for nine soldiers. 
  In order to achieve the location of the center of weight on 
the axis of the center of the uplift pressure, the designers had 
to place the greatest burdens symmetrically, along the 
lengthwise axis of the frame. The drive of the vehicle, which 
is a 800-horsepower MTU V 6 engine, is at the front, behind the 
driver. In the central part there is an armament turret; in the 
rear part -- there is room for six soldiers. 
  The front was designed to enable smooth ride on the water 
and 
to achieve a positive dynamic uplift pressure. Above this board 
there is a suspendible breakwater. The drive mechanism consists 
of six special drive wheels of 6 centimeters in diameter. 
  Above the landing-troops part two tight hatches were 
designed. The rear, more specifically, the loading platform 
which is lifted hydraulically, has two hatches as well. 
  The armament of this vehicle is supposed to be the same as 
the armament in the other vehicle. 
<H5>  Will the Army Buy It? </H5>
  It is too early for the final answer. It cannot be said 
today whether the Army will be interested in one or both offers. 
However, it is good that there is something going on in our 
arms industry. At any rate, it seems that the above-described 
constructions of OBRUM may be some supplement to the cooperative 
offer (with the Swedish Bofors) of the factory in Stalowa Wola.

  [Text] Belgrade, 24 May (TANJUG) -- Federal Foreign 
Minister Vladislav Jovanovic today had a news conference with 
participants in the 32d International Meeting of Journalists, 
organized by the Associations of Yugoslav Journalists. The aim 
of the meeting is to exchange opinions on journalism and the 
world order. In response to many questions Jovanovic informed 
his guests, from 36 countries which are taking part in the 
meeting, about the basic principles of Yugoslavia's foreign 
policy and the plans for the period after the sanctions are 
lifted. He also explained the course of the Yugoslav crisis, 
with a special comment on the Bosnian conflict. 
  "Our main commitment and the basic principles of our foreign 
policy are peace, a political solution to the Yugoslav crisis, 
and especially the Bosnian conflict, the lifting of the 
sanctions and eventually a complete reintegration of the FRY 
into international trends," the Yugoslav foreign minister said. 
  According to Jovanovic, when the sanctions are lifted, 
Yugoslavia is ready to assume an active role in the 
integrational processes not only in the Balkans, but also in 
Europe. He mentioned one of the provisions of the Yugoslav 
Constitution whereby all those who seceded can rejoin the FRY, 
if they wish to do so. "We are open, not closed to others." 
  Asked by a Romanian journalist what the neighboring 
countries 
could do to speed up the lifting of the sanctions, Jovanovic 
said: "The sanctions are not only the consequence, but also a 
cause of the Yugoslav crisis. They are a cause because, unless 
they are lifted, there will be no peace in Bosnia." 
  Jovanovic went on to say that the sanctions "have a deadly 
effect on certain countries in the region." He said that the 
neighboring countries could contribute to the lifting of the 
sanctions if they treat them as their own problem, not only as 
Yugoslavia's problem. This means that they should request an 
explanation from the Security Council about the actual purpose 
of the sanctions. Serbian-Croatian relations was one of the 
issues raised at the news conference. 
  "Relations between Serbia and Croatia have been the key to 
stability in the Balkans ever since the beginning of this 
century," Jovanovic said. 
  "We are aware of this fact in the current crisis, too. But 
we did not want this crisis. On the contrary, we had been 
constantly warning of its consequences. Regrettably, the Croats 
strove to bring about crisis, which resulted in heavy conflicts 
between the two peoples. Our intentions are clear. We expect 
Croatia to demonstrate goodwill in the full normalization of 
relations." 
  In this context Jovanovic was asked about the division of 
inherited assets between the former Yugoslav republics and the 
FRY. 
  "First of all, the division of assets should be separated 
from our right to continuity. The process of dividing assets is 
taking place within the Geneva Conference. It is unfortunately 
making very slow progress. The reason behind this is the fact 
that the FRY insists that all the rights and obligations 
pertaining to the division [of assets] should include everything 
that stems from 1918; in the case of the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia everything that stems from the Balkans 
wars. The seceded Yugoslav republics insist on dividing what 
had been created together since the 1974 Constitution". 
  The reporters were interested in the media war against the 
FRY. 
  "We have lost the media war without taking part in it. This 
is in a way a result of our mentality since we believe in the 
truth and are incapable of peddling lies to the world." 
  A reporter from Israel asked Jovanovic about 
Yugoslav-Israeli 
relations. 
  Jovanovic said that since the end of World War II 
Yugoslavia's foreign policies were formulated and carried out by 
people from the western half of the country. He noted that 
Tito, Kardelj, Bakaric, Vrhovec, and Loncar had been the chief 
designers. 
  "Serbian politicians were not influential in formulating 
foreign policies," Jovanovic said and added: "For example, the 
decision to break off diplomatic relations with Israel was taken 
by Tito at a time when he was visiting the Soviet Union. Marko 
Nikezic opposed this but he was ignored." 
  "We are sorry if Israel thinks that the FRY is responsible 
for the suspension of diplomatic ties in 1967. I would like to 
remind you that, even before the disintegration of the Socialist 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic tried to exert influence on Yugoslav foreign policy, 
but he failed to do so because of the dominance of people from 
the western part of the country." 
  "We want Israel to open an embassy in Belgrade as soon as 
possible," Jovanovic said. 
  In conclusion Jovanovic commented on the latest efforts to 
solve the Bosnian conflict. He said Belgrade supports efforts 
leading to peace, and in that context he stressed the importance 
of the recent Geneva meeting of the five foreign ministers from 
the EU, Russia, and the United States. 
  "It is commendable that the five foreign ministers are 
trying 
together to search for peace. It is commendable that they have 
gone back to the European plan, and that they agreed there would 
be no solution to the Bosnian conflict unless the sanctions are 
lifted. We believe that the meeting of the five would have been 
more successful if they had adopted a clearer position on the 
sanctions. I assert that the Bosnian Muslims will sign a peace 
agreement two weeks after the lifting of the sanctions."

  [Text] Podgorica, May 24 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. sanctions 
have almost completely destroyed the merchant fleet of 
Montenegro which accounted for about 20 percent of the 
republic's annual foreign currency revenue and five percent of 
its entire earnings. Estimates are that the two-year isolation 
has caused damages exceeding 200 million dollars to two major 
maritime companies: `Prekookeanska Plovidba' of the Adriatic 
part of Bar and `Jugooceanija' of Kotor. A total of 37 
Montenegrin ships, totalling 977,000 dwt, have been stranded in 
various ports throughout the world. 
  Cargo transport, port reloading and shipbuilding activities 
have ground to a complete halt, said Radomir Mugosa, the 
secretary of the Association of Maritime Economy in the 
Montenegrin Chamber of Economy. He added that the 1993 
maintenance costs of ships belonging to `Prekookeanska Plovidba' 
and `Jugooceania' and which are stranded in foreign ports 
exceeded 50 million dollars. In order to preserve the bulk of 
their fleets, the two companies were in 1993 forced to sell two 
ships with a dwt of over 80,000. 
  The port of Bar, which is capable of reloading five million 
tonnes of goods, has not had any earnings because no ships have 
entered it over the past two years, Mugosa said. He added that 
the shipbuilding yard `Veljko Vlahovic,' in Bijela, has also 
suspended its activities although it used to overhaul between 
80-100 ships before the sanctions.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim </F>
Rugova by Dorrit Saietz; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Denmark is currently being visited by a president 
without a country. Literature Professor Ibrahim Rugova is the 
popularly elected leader of 2 million Kosovo Albanians. But the 
Serbian Government in Belgrade refuses to recognize his and his 
countrymen's desire for independence. The tense situation in 
Kosovo has not yet erupted into open war. This is due in no 
small measure to President Rugova's and his supporters' 
insistence on nonviolent resistance. 
  "If war broke out in Kosovo it would be a catastrophe for 
us. 
It would be much worse than in Croatia or Bosnia. We have no 
police, no military forces, no means of defending ourselves," 
Ibrahim Rugova said in an interview with DET FRI AKTUELT. The 
Serbian authorities have been consistent in closing or taking 
over Albanian institutions, and ethnic Albanians have been fired 
from their posts in public administration. The Serbs amount to 
only 10 percent of the population in Kosovo, but today they 
dominate the apparatus of power. Nevertheless, up to now the 
resistance to the Serbs has been peaceful. 
  "The Albanian population follows the policy of nonviolence, 
even though this is not easy when every day you are mistreated, 
persecuted, and purged." How does one behave as president when 
one's state and government are not recognized? 
  "It is difficult, of course. But it is we who have the 
morale and the political organization, while the Serbs only have 
their military power. That is the difference between them and 
us. I am president because I agree with my people," Rugova 
said, explaining how the parliament, which after two years has 
still not been able to meet, and the government nevertheless are 
able to function. 
  "The parliament works with different groups and commissions 
and with the four parties that are represented. We also have a 
government, part of which is abroad and part in Kosovo itself. 
We have ministers for education, health, information, and so on. 
  ``We have also organized a system of solidarity which makes 
sure that money, food, and foodstuffs are distributed to those 
who are in need." 
  All this works in parallel with the Serbian government 
machinery. 
  Is there a solution to the whole of the Yugoslav conflict? 
  "What is important in Bosnia is first and foremost to stop 
the war. And then it is also a question of whether or not 
Bosnia can survive as a state. If the Serbs get their way in 
Bosnia they are bound to become even more aggressive. If the 
Serbs are not halted there they will go further in Kosovo and 
Macedonia." 
  The Kosovo Albanians want an independent, neutral state 
between Serbia and Albania. Deep down they dream about becoming 
a part of Albania, Ibrahim Rugova admitted. But they know very 
well that this is politically unrealistic. What many Western 
observers fear is that the Kosovo Albanians' call for 
independence will have a contagious effect on the situation in 
Macedonia where there is another large Albanian minority. This 
would cause further irritation in Greece and the scene would 
then be set for a large-scale war in the Balkans which would 
make the present conflict look like a tea party. 
  Ibrahim Rugova is aware of and fears this risk. But how much 
longer can the Kosovo Albanians' patience last? 
  "I do not know. It does not depend on us Albanians alone. 
It could happen that some sudden provocation could come from 
the Serbs. Perhaps they might start doing something in a small 
way, but in the end everything would just become too much," he 
said. 
  In Denmark Ibrahim Rugova has been received at prime 
minister 
level and has met Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social 
Democratic Party) and Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen 
(Radical Liberal Party). "We have met with an understanding of 
Kosovo's situation. We asked that Denmark, through the EU 
[European Union], should apply pressure so that something is 
done that can prevent a conflict from flaring up. A year ago 
the CSCE mission in Kosovo was expelled. Since then they have 
been working to return, but have not been given permission. It 
is the Serbs who have the power and control everything. 
  Rugova wants Kosovo to be placed under international 
surveillance by the United Nations or the EU. 
  "We have also asked for Kosovo to be included as part of the 
global problems which have to be solved in the former 
Yugoslavia. We demand the right to self-determination. And that 
the way of peace which the Albanians have chosen will become 
recognized by the international community."

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by </F>
Jan Horak; place and date not given: "The Czech Republic Is No 
Longer a Rookie in Europe"] 
  [Text] [Horak] What is your assessment of the independent 
Czech Republic so far? 
  [Zieleniec] The first year of our foreign policy was really 
remarkable. It was very important for us to emphasize the Czech 
state's continuity in relation to the traditions of 
Czechoslovakia in the 1920's and 1930's and, in the wake of 
1989, to follow up on the prestige that Czechoslovakia had in 
the world. It goes without saying that this year also 
symbolized the republic's inclusion in the international-legal 
structure. It meant intensive negotiations in connection with 
transferring the validity of Czechoslovakia's treaties to the 
Czech Republic. It also meant specifying our foreign policy 
position in relation to other countries. The same applies for 
countries as for people; that is, anyone who newly enters into a 
collective or society is faced with all sorts of pressures. We 
were also faced with these pressures; this is natural. It is 
like a rookie entering military service. He must demonstrate 
clearly his interests, his strengths. The same thing applies 
for states. I believe that this stage is behind us: The 
majority of states, especially the surrounding European ones, 
are clearly aware of our position, our interests, and our 
values. I am pleased that our situation is now the way it is. 
  [Horak] Membership in the European Union (EU) and NATO is 
one of the main goals of Czech foreign policy. Part of Western 
Europe, for example, the French socialists, object to the 
admission of Eastern Europe. 
  [Zieleniec] I would be reluctant to use phrases that specify 
the French socialists as part of Europe. Of course, this 
problem is obvious to us. States with whom we have experienced 
our history and with whom we share a system of values and a way 
of life are part of the EU. This is the family to which we 
belong and want to belong. If we take this as a starting point 
and if we agree that the absolute majority of these states 
realize that the borders created by the Cold War are artificial 
and have no civilizational or cultural justification, then this 
issue is placed in a different light. Naturally, the admission 
of a specific country represents for individual entities in 
various countries of Western Europe this or that problem. 
  The admission of a large country, for example, Poland, means 
a problem for agriculture in France; the EU's common 
agricultural policy would find it hard to come to terms with 
Polish agriculture today. It is possible to give many such 
examples. Therefore, specific special-interest groups express 
themselves in this or that manner. However, what I said in the 
introduction and what the political creme de la creme of the 
intellectual elite realize and what -- in my opinion -- the 
absolute majority of the citizens of Western Europe recognize 
generally applies, that is, we belong to each other and 
maintaining this artificial division is not only unnatural, but 
is dangerous for all of us. 
  [Horak] Let us be more specific: What will entry into the 
EU actually mean for us? 
  [Zieleniec] Our entry into the EU may not be automatic for 
these reasons. Membership in the EU means many specific 
commitments and it is sui generis a transaction. This is not 
only a boon for us, it must also be a boon for them. In order 
for this to happen, we must, first and foremost, transform this 
state and we have to achieve what we set out to achieve in 1989: 
The Czech Republic must become a standard democratic Western 
European state with an efficient Western European-type economy. 
We have made a good start in this direction. I am convinced 
that it will not be too long before this happens. However, we 
must be aware of our responsibility for the integration process. 
I would like to emphasize one thing that is terribly important 
for me. One is not accepted among advanced states, we must 
simply become an advanced state. 
  [Horak] The so-called Balladur Plan says in a nutshell 
roughly the following: Become stable first, and then we will 
admit you into our structures. The Czech Republic does not 
quite agree with this; why has it not rejected it officially? 
  [Zieleniec] I would be averse to formulating the Balladur 
Plan the way you formulated it, and I would also be reluctant to 
say that I agree or disagree with such a thing. The so-called 
stability pact, which is now under discussion, is not for us 
directly linked with the issue of entry into the EU. Its 
starting point is the Yugoslav crisis and the attempt at 
preventive diplomacy. This is an attempt to ascertain the 
problems within Central and Eastern Europe and to try to resolve 
these problems somehow before they become more than we can 
handle. The motive or objective, therefore, is praiseworthy 
and, of course, we share it. The problem is that it is not only 
important to have proper objectives, it is also important to 
have the instruments for realizing these objectives. If we do 
not have them, these objectives may often be turned against 
their original aim. The key concepts for the stability pact are 
the ethnic minorities and the attempt to resolve this issue on 
the basis of these minorities' collective rights and on their 
international confirmation. 
  [Horak] Is the issue of minorities in Europe not being 
exaggerated? 
  [Zieleniec] I personally feel that the minority issue, which 
is common in Europe because ethnic borders cannot be drawn here, 
is soluble within a democratic law-governed state. This is a 
pillar on which modern Europe stands. Another pillar is a 
functioning, efficient economy. In places where these pillars 
have been given strong foundations and society has been erected 
on them, minority issues do not represent a threat to society's 
stability and do not become the focus of international tension. 
If, from this point of view, the whole of Western Europe is in 
principle stable, then this is because it is erected on these 
very pillars. It is an illusion to believe that it is possible 
to resolve this issue otherwise and we are also concerned that 
viewing it insensitively and isolating it out of context without 
linking it to these two pillars could lead to a renewal of 
tension and to the destabilization of many states in Central and 
Eastern Europe. We are not against the conference on a 
stability pact in Europe; I think, however, that the key to 
resolving the problem is not a pact that would concentrate only 
on the minority issue, but that the solution lies elsewhere. 
There are two processes or two institutions in Europe that know 
how to deal with this type of problem: The CSCE and the Council 
of Europe. I would welcome it if the Paris conference, which is 
now under preparation, were to culminate in a recommendation to 
these two institutions to deal more intensely with the 
aforementioned issues. 
  [Horak] The Central European Initiative and the Visegrad 
Group are two such institutions of which we are members. What 
is your opinion of the Czech Republic's participation in them so 
far and of their prospects? 
  [Zieleniec] I would protest a little about the use of the 
word institution. The SEI has some of the traits of an 
institution, it even has a small secretariat and a regime of 
regular meetings, expert commissions, and so on. The Visegrad 
Group has nothing like this. This has always been more of a 
symbolic name for the meetings involving the representatives of 
several neighboring states. We feel that the region should live 
together more intensively. The problem consists of how to 
achieve this. We are convinced that it is incredibly important 
for economic cooperation to function well; it is the basis for 
good relations between states. Therefore, we are pushing very 
much for the speedy creation of a Central European Free Trade 
Zone (CEFTA). We are pushing for cooperation in concrete 
projects that are specific to the region such as, for example, 
the construction of railroad or other transportation networks, 
cooperation in the environment, and so on. We do not want 
political and military cooperation to become a regional 
activity; this would imply the formation of alternative 
institutions to the EU. We also do not want to organize 
pressure groups aimed at achieving our admission into the EU or 
NATO. 
  [Horak] We sometimes hear from Poland and Hungary that 
Prague is in too much of a hurry. 
  [Zieleniec] We do not want to leave anyone behind; we do not 
want to be the first at any cost. The issue is associated more 
with my reply to the previous question: We feel that it is 
impossible to become a member of the EU or the North Atlantic 
Alliance by means of pressure. The center of gravity for the 
integration process is here in our countries and we are creating 
a united Europe by their transformation. We would be giving our 
citizens the wrong sign if we were to claim that the center of 
gravity for integration consists of constant visits to Brussels 
and of clamoring for information on admission. 
  The SEI is an open institution to us, an institution that, 
by 
affiliating states that belong to what I would call the 
traditional West, such as Italy and Austria, states that are 
relatively advanced in transforming their economies and 
societies, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, or Poland, and 
states that are not quite so advanced, is perhaps a suitable 
platform for exchanging experiences on coming to terms with the 
complicated process that is taking place in so many European 
countries. Therefore, I proposed at the last meeting in Trieste 
that the SEI does not act like a closed group that establishes 
complex admission procedures, association statutes, and so on, 
but opens itself up to the other countries of Central and 
Eastern Europe. 
  [Horak] Cooperation with Slovakia is significant, especially 
in the economic sphere, which the public is also most aware of. 
The foreign policy contacts between our two states will always 
have a special stamp. Do you see any problems in this sphere? 
  [Zieleniec] I think that the period since 1 January 1993 has 
been a major success. Our foreign partners often ask me what 
our relations with Slovakia are like and I describe to them what 
we achieved in the complex conditions for dividing the state and 
how we managed to organize our lives, mutual contacts, trade, 
and so on. Our partners then say that this is a major success. 
They realize that we, who see these relations in the newspaper 
headlines -- for example, that we have still not managed to deal 
with movement on the borders, or this or that item in trade, the 
certificates, and so on -- have a tendency to view our relations 
through these problems. However, when we realize that these are 
the only problems -- which, at the same time, are constantly 
being resolved -- and that, from this technical point of view, 
our mutual relations are being enhanced, then this is a major 
success. I am convinced that our Slovak partners also look at 
it like this. We have done a great deal of work together. 
  [Horak] Germany is, without doubt, one of our most 
important foreign policy partners. Do you think that, in this 
so-called super-election year, it is worth negotiating with 
Germany on certain more weighty issues without reference to 
whether it would be better to wait until the post-election 
period? 
  [Zieleniec] The political process with regard to Germany is 
proceeding and it is good that it is proceeding. The relations 
between our states are definitely not influenced so 
fundamentally by domestic political opportunism for it to matter 
which government in Germany we negotiate with. I assume that 
the same thing applies in our country, that the majority of the 
parliamentary parties in the Czech Republic would conduct a 
similar policy toward Germany. It is a question, in our country 
and in Germany, of national interests and these have a slightly 
broader base than party ideology. 
  [Horak] The former Soviet Union was the most important 
trading partner of the former Czechoslovakia and it is possible 
to say that the intensity of relations between Russia and the 
Czech Republic has declined somewhat along with the rapid 
reduction in mutual trade. Is any change to be expected soon in 
this regard? 
  [Zieleniec] When I think of the contacts in recent months 
alone -- several ministerial visits, for example, Minister 
Dlouhy's, then there was my visit, Prime Minister Klaus' visit, 
President Yeltsin was here, and Minister Kozyrev -- then it 
seems to me that this is an intensive level of contacts. I 
would find it difficult to accept that the intensity of mutual 
contacts has declined. Perhaps it has, if you relate it to the 
period before 1989, but I do not know if these were 
international contacts in the true sense of the word; it was 
more that visits were made to Moscow for instructions. Now 
these are relations between equal states, they are intensive 
relations as corresponds to Russia's position as a superpower, 
as a huge market, and as a country with which we conduct 
extensive trade and from which we receive a great deal of our 
energy raw materials. It is flattering for us that we are able 
to maintain balanced relations with Russia, despite the fact 
that there was a fundamental shift in our alliance orientation 
in 1989. We now consider ourselves to be a country that is not 
only striving for membership in the EU, but a country that 
belongs to the Western system from an alliance point of view. 
  [Horak] How much weight does current Czech foreign policy 
attach to cooperation or contacts with Czechoslovakia's former 
fraternal countries, for example, the DPRK, Cuba, China, or 
Vietnam where, to this day, authoritarian regimes are still in 
power? 
  [Zieleniec] We have to differentiate a little here. If you 
are referring to China and Vietnam, these are countries that 
have embarked upon development toward a market economy, 
countries that are becoming democratized gradually. This is 
logical; a market economy cannot operate for long without 
democracy. There is an obvious trend in these countries. 
Something slightly different applies to countries such as North 
Korea or Cuba where the level of human rights violations is 
unacceptable to us. They are excluding themselves from the 
international community. This, however, does not mean that we 
are overlooking these issues elsewhere. I gave my partners in 
Vietnam a list of the people we know are being persecuted for 
political reasons. I have also discussed these issues in 
China. However, it is very important to find the correct 
balance for the individual concerns. Our partners must see that 
we talk about these issues with compassion, that it is not just 
empty instruction. 
  On the other hand, as I said, I look upon these countries 
with optimism and, following my visits to them, my optimism has 
increased. 
  [Horak] Taiwan has opened a Taipei office in our country. 
As we do not have diplomatic relations with each other, is some 
thought being given to a change in this respect? 
  [Zieleniec] We recognize the People's Republic of China, 
but, on the other hand, we maintain trading relations with 
Taiwan. For these reasons, we do not have a diplomatic mission 
in Taiwan. As far as I know, however, our Chamber of Commerce 
has opened a representative office there and is representing the

<F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav </F>
Klaus by Lucie Weissova; place and date not given -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Weissova] The NATO Council 
last week agreed to offer Russia special status in the 
Partnership for Peace program. You reacted to it in the daily 
TELEGRAF by saying that it does not bother you at all because 
Russia is still the second largest power with nuclear weapons 
and that therefore it must be treated accordingly. Do you not 
think that this position of Russia's poses a threat to small 
states of central and Eastern Europe? 
  [Klaus] Russia is the position that it is. It is as big as 
it is. It really possesses nuclear weapons. By its mere 
existence it both poses and does not pose a threat to countries 
around it and I think the way in which NATO, not us, has decided 
to treat Russia is simply something that apparently corresponds 
to the situation as it exists. The most essential thing for us 
is that someone else has decided the matter rather than us, and 
I believe strong words from us do not and indeed cannot lead 
anywhere. We all have stressed that Partnership for Peace is an 
individual program and that each country should contribute to 
that program what it feels it can contribute -- how much and how 
closely it wants to link itself to NATO. We also see that 
individual countries are doing exactly this. [passage omitted] 
Each country takes a different view and I think that strongly 
worded statements from us aimed against Russia do not, in my 
view, truly lead anywhere. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Czech-Russian Talks Are Faltering </F>
on the Concept for the Structure of Imports"] 
  [Text] Although the outcome of the visit by the Russian 
delegation that was holding talks in Prague this week on Czech 
outstanding claims in Russia did not live up to expectations, 
they are still not a reason for skepticism. This is roughly the 
opinion of Jan Hronik, who took part in the talks on behalf of 
the Trade and Industry Ministry. During his visit to Moscow in 
April and within the framework of his talks on restructuring the 
Russian debts, Vaclav Klaus also agreed with the Russian prime 
minister that the list of goods that Russia, during the course 
of this and next year, would deliver to Czech enterprises as 
part payment of its debts will be signed in May. In Prague, 
however, the Russian delegation -- according to Hronik -- 
submitted a list of goods that does not correspond to the 
requirements and needs of the Czech side, even if the goods were 
to be earmarked for reexport. Apparently, the bulk of the 
Russian list was made up of engineering products, which are 
manufactured in the Czech Republic, while the Czech side would 
be interested, first and foremost, in certain Russian raw 
materials. Nevertheless, the two sides are willing to work 
further on the list and to harmonize their concepts, although it 
is clear that the Czech Republic will, obviously, be more 
active. There already exists a draft mechanism whereby the 
receipts from the eventual import of Russian goods would be 
divided between the enterprises that have outstanding claims in 
Russia. Their overall amount hovers around $300 million. 
  A little progress was also made on the possibility of 
capitalizing these outstanding claims. In Prague, the Russian 
side submitted proposals for facilities in which the state is 
still involved and that the Russian state would perhaps be 
willing to offer the Czech enterprises in return for their 
outstanding claims. 
  This involves, for example, electrical engineering and 
petrochemical products and some unfinished facilities. The 
Czech firms interested in capitalizing their outstanding claims 
in Russia can already "hold consultations" with the Russian 
State Committee for the Administration of State Property -- 
which is the local version of the Czech National Property Fund 
-- on their concepts. Nevertheless, a law is only now being 
drafted in Russia that would make foreign investment possible by 
a form of capitalizing outstanding claims. 
  Russia does not have the slightest wish to include oil and 
gas in the list of goods suggested as a part payment of its 
debts. Nevertheless, following the Prague talks, it seems that 
an inter- governmental protocol could be signed in the 
foreseeable future that would guarantee the Czech Republic a 
long-term Russian supply of both oil and gas. Whereas, in view 
of the envisaged diversification of sources, the precise volume 
of oil would be specified every year (this would involve roughly 
7.0 million tonnes per annum), in the case of gas, the protocol 
would define directly the amount for each year (8.0 billion 
cubic meters in 1996 up to 10.5 billion in the year 2000). 
Naturally, the payment for the oil is expected in convertible 
currencies at world prices and at world conditions, while part 
of the gas could perhaps be paid for by Czech construction and 
supplies for the Russian gas industry and by transit services.

Placates"] 
  [Text] Nuremberg/Krumlov -- On the occasion of the 
awarding of the "European Charles IV Prize" of the Sudeten 
German Landsmannschaft in Nuremberg at Whitsun weekend, Foreign 
Minister Alois Mock said that the expulsion of the Sudeten 
Germans after World War II was "one of the major unlawful acts" 
of the 20th century. However, Mock also recalled that the 
crimes of the National Socialists had preceded the forcible 
resettlement. 
  In Krumov, Prague's Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told 
Austrian journalists that Mock's comments in connection with the 
awarding of the Charles IV Prize "might burden bilateral 
relations." "However, the whole affair should not be 
overestimated either."

<F P=106> [CTK and "(r)"-signed report: "Astonishment at the </F>
Statements of Minister Mock"] 
  [Excerpt] Prague/Vienna -- Ladislav Spacek, the 
president's press spokesman, said the following in reply to a 
question from LIDOVE NOVINY on Austrian Foreign Minister Alois 
Mock's interpretation of a statement by V. Havel on the 
expulsion of the Sudeten Germans: "If V. Havel condemns the 
principle of collective guilt and the collective responsibility 
of nations, this does not mean that he is placing a historically 
equals sign between the ethnic cleansing in present-day 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the post-war expulsion of the Sudeten 
Germans, with which the victorious powers expressed their 
agreement and which was in response to the horrors of World War 
II. It is astonishing that the Austrian foreign minister is 
again returning to issues that had been resolved in December 
1974 in the Czechoslovak-Austrian treaty on settling financial 
and property-related legal issues. All the claims for 
compensation from Austrian physical and legal persons and also 
from the Austrian state for Czechoslovak indemnification and 
confiscation measures from World War II were settled by this 
treaty." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] According to Minister Lux, the report on the 
state of Czech agriculture last year, which was published today, 
states that the structural changes in that sphere are being 
carried out much faster than those in industry. Ales Hermanek 
reports: 
  [Hermanek] According to the report, the nonstate sector has 
a 
77 percent share in overall agricultural production, which is 
almost double that in industry. In the Czech Republic, new 
private entities own approximately 85 percent of land, out of 
which 18 percent is owned by natural persons. 
  In this connection, Minister Lux said that in view of the 
fact that the majority of owners have assumed their rights, 
their number is much higher than the number of business units. 
Another result of this is that rented land constitutes 60 
percent of overall arable land. The average farm size -- 
probably still a result of forcible collectivization under the 
communist regime -- is 10 times as large as that of comparable 
entities in the countries of the European Union, representing 
over 135 hectares of land. [passage omitted] 
  In 1993, the overall loss in agriculture was 9.7 billion 
crowns, while the share of state farms in this figure is over 3 
billion crowns. 
  Minister Lux noted as positive the approximately 16 percent 
rise in food prices last year, inasmuch as consumer prices grew 
by over 20 percent in the same period.

  [Text] Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman received in 
the Presidential Palace this evening a delegation of countries 
whose diplomatic envoys make up the contact group for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. French Ambassador Henri Marie-Chenu, British 
Ambassador Brian Sparrow, Belgian Ambassador Frans Hintjens, 
Aleksandr Grishchenko, deputy head of the Russian diplomatic 
mission, and German Charge d'Affaires Claude Robert Elner 
informed President Tudjman about conclusions reached at a 
meeting in Geneva yesterday by ministers of foreign affairs of 
the countries whose diplomatic envoys make up the contact group 
for Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  They handed President Tudjman a letter which the ministers 
of 
the contact group had sent to Alija Izetbegovic, president of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency, Kresimir Zubak, 
representative of the Bosnian Croats, and Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic, containing the principles that the contact 
group is going to follow to halt the hostilities in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. President Tudjman said he agreed with these 
principles and promised to exert his influence so that the 
negotiating sides should accept these principles and new 
measures for the resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis.

  [Text] Knin, May 24 (TANJUG) - The second phase of talks 
about the normalisation of relations between the republic of 
Serb Krajina and Croatia will start in early June, a U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman in Krajina said on Tuesday 
[24 May]. 
  Speaking at a regular news conference of military, police 
and 
civilian UNPROFOR officials in sector south of the 
U.N.-protected area of Krajina, a spokesman said that UNPROFOR 
central commissions had given a positive assessment at their 
latest meeting of the implementation of the Zagreb agreement on 
the cessation of hostilities signed by Krajina and Croatia. 
They agreed that the next phase of talks about economic and 
humanitarian issues could begin now. 
  The republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed by the local 
Serbs in their ancestral lands within former Croatia in 1991, in 
response to the republic's violent secession from the former 
Yugoslav federation and violations of the local Serbs' rights. 
Krajina has been a U.N.-protected area since 1992 and 14,000 
peacekeepers are deployed there. Krajina and Croatia started 
the negotiating process in March 1994, with U.S. and Russian 
mediation, and agreed on a ceasefire and separation of the two 
armies along the 1,000-km long lines of separation, currently 
controlled by UNPROFOR. 
  The spokesman said that a meeting between Krajina President 
Milan Martic and UNPROFOR Chief of Civil Affairs in sector South 
Enrique Aguilar on Monday [23 May] had focused on the assessment 
of the situation ahead of the beginning of negotiations about 
economic issues, which the spokesman described as having been 
somewhat postponed by the Croatian Government. 
  The meeting also dealt with the venue of the talks, the 
spokesman said, but refused to disclose further details. He 
only said that Geneva and some other places outside Croatia were 
discussed and added that Krajina representatives would receive a 
letter with the time and place proposed for the talks. 
  The U.N. secretary-general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi 
told Martic in a telephone conversation on Monday that he was 
interested in the resumption of the talks, but that he did not 
intend to accept Martic's proposal to be the chief mediator in 
the future talks, because talks about economic issues were 
within the jurisdiction of the international conference on the 
former Yugoslavia, the spokesman said. 
  Colonel Bill Morton, deputy UNPROFOR commander of Sector 
South, said that UNPROFOR's observation posts had been placed in 
the area of disengagement but that none of them had been placed 
in its final position. The corrections will be made only after 
the mine fields have been cleared, he said. 
  Col. Morton said that the lines of disengagement on Mt. 
Velebit were difficult to control because of the rugged terrain. 
Smaller units of both sides have been sighted in the area of 
disengagement in the region, he said, and they seem to be 
observing each other. 
  The deputy chief of UNPROFOR civilian police has announced 
that new police substations would be opened in this sector 
within eight days, and added that the civilian police has 
established a fixed way of operation within the area of 
disengagement and that serb and Croat police units have begun to 
patrol the area as well.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and </F>
foreign minister, by Gordan Nuhanovic; place and date not given: 
"The United States Will Support the Federation Position"] 
  [Text] In the few hours between arriving from Vienna and 
leaving for Geneva, Foreign Minister Mate Granic agreed to a 
short interview. 
  [Nuhanovic] Mr. Granic, after the Croat-Bosniak agreement 
has been signed, there is an impression that the United States 
has provided no specific guarantees for the agreed 58 percent of 
the territory for the federation, other than the "paper" ones. 
  [Granic] This percentage is a matter of principle. We 
should be aware of the fact that these are the areas in which 
the Croats and Bosniaks form a majority. Great success has been 
achieved with the Vienna agreement: The negotiating position of 
the Bosniak-Croat federation has been consolidated. There are, 
of course, no specific guarantees, but the aim has been achieved 
in Vienna -- the Federation has been consolidated. The stronger 
the Federation is, the stronger the U.S. support will be. 
  [Nuhanovic] However, the positions of the international 
forces are divided. Namely, the same day the Vienna agreement 
was signed, Alain Juppe stated he hoped the ministers in Geneva 
would support the proposal of 51 percent for the Federation and 
49 percent for the Serbs. What is your comment on that? 
  [Granic] This is a well-known position represented by 
France, Russia, and Great Britain. The United States is close 
to that position, but it will not accept the position if the 
Federation does not accept it. 
  [Nuhanovic] What would the lifting of the arms embargo in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina mean for Croatia? 
  [Granic] The present situation should be distinguished from 
that of about six months ago, during the conflicts between the 
Muslims and Croats. In that situation it would have been 
negative both for the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for 
Croatia. The Croat position that the Bosniaks are victims of 
Serb aggression just as the Croats are is well known. The 
international community believes that an agreement can be 
reached by putting pressure on the Serb side. However, if that 
does not happen, then the defense of the Croats and Bosniaks in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is the only way out. Croatia supported this 
elementary right in the Security Council. Ultimately, though, we 
consider participating in the Partnership for Peace as much more 
important, and the same goes for the disarming in the area. We 
will specifically support that. We would like the international 
community to become more involved, but we will not give up our 
legitimate rights in Croatia, just as it is a legitimate right 
of the Croat and Bosniak people in Bosnia-Herzegovina to defend 
themselves. However, after everything that has happened, it 
would be better if peace were imposed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
When I say this, I am thinking of the Serbian side. 
  [Nuhanovic] Could you comment on Ganic and Durakovic's 
appearance at the Vienna negotiations? Their political 
positions were significantly different from what was agreed at 
the end. 
  [Granic] It is never good to talk about what happened during 
negotiations. Both sides were a little afraid, but the 
influence of the U.S. mediator was beneficial, as was that of 
the Croatian side. However, the solutions are better than was 
anticipated, as they are solutions that lead toward the end of 
the war. Naturally, another important thing is that the 
international position of Croatia has become even stronger.

<F P=106> [HINA report on talks between Croatian Prime Minister Nikica </F>
Valentic and Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek in Otocec ob 
Krki on 14 May: "Positions Concerning Border Crossings 
Coordinated"] 
  [Text] On Saturday Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic 
and Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek met in Otocec ob Krki 
to discuss the relations between the two countries and certain 
contentious issues. 
  After the talks, Prime Minister Valentic told the reporters 
that in the informal talks with Slovene Prime Minister Drnovsek 
all the bilateral relations and problems between Croatia and 
Slovenia were tackled. "We established that many operative 
problems have been solved since the last time the Slovene prime 
minister officially visited Croatia. These problems involve the 
issue concerning Krsko, the signing of bilateral agreements, and 
the verifications of these agreements by the Croatian Parliament. 
  We openly discussed other unsolved issues, such as the issue 
of agreements concerning the property-rights relations, that is, 
the regulation according to which it is still not possible in 
Croatia to privatize companies owned by other republics, and we 
believe that the Croatian Government will resolve that within a 
short period. 
  We also discussed the well-known problem of Ljubljanska 
Banka, and agreed that within 30 days the ministers of finance 
will get in touch and propose an agreement acceptable to both 
sides. We have also arranged an official visit of the Croatian 
Government to Ljubljana in late June," said Nikica Valentic. 
  The Croatian prime minister also remarked that there was 
talk 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees accommodated in the housing 
owned by Slovene companies in Pineta, which, as he pointed out, 
the Croatian Government considers a very complex problem. The 
Croatian Government will fulfill its obligations regarding the 
moving of the refugees from Pineta. The problem is that the 
refugees are in such a psychological and physical state that 
they are refusing to leave the facilities, and the Government 
would not like to throw them out, although they have already 
provided other accommodation for them. 
<H5>  Commercial Prices for Pineta </H5>
  We believe that we will be able to solve that problem within 
a short period also, and the Croatian Government is prepared to 
compensate for damages and all the costs that have arisen with 
the refugees staying in the Slovenian companies' housing. We 
are prepared to buy these facilities from all the Slovenian 
companies, at commercial prices, and we will propose this to the 
owners next week. Naturally, those who do not accept the offer 
will remain owners, and retain all their rights, said prime 
minister Valentic. 
  He also said that during the conversation with Slovene Prime 
Minister Janez Drnovsek the border crossings were discussed. 
"We believe we have coordinated our positions concerning all 
the crossings," said Valentic, remarking that Plovanija is a 
great problem for Croatia, since it is the main road entrance to 
Croatia from the west and through Slovenia. 
  "The coming tourist season is very important for us, and 
this 
crossing, which is still an untidy building-site, represents a 
great problem. Next week we will send a letter to the Slovene 
Government and the public concerning this problem, and try to 
find a temporary solution for this tourist season, and the 
Croatian Government will provide guarantees that this does not 
prejudice any solution for the border lines," said Valentic. 
  "We discussed the Piran Bay and supported the work of the 
committees. The Slovene Government stayed by their demand, and 
I believe that a solution acceptable to both sides will be 
found. It is important that there have been no incidents and 
that the cooperation between the police of the two countries is 
very good," said Prime Minister Valentic. He stated that the 
positions concerning the Yugoslav debts have been fully 
coordinated, and "we have made a joint demand that the 
succession process be speeded up. We have also agreed that 
solidaristic guarantees of the former Yugoslav debts by 
individual republics are out of the question. Instead, we want 
to take our debts after the succession and regularly service 
them, especially as Croatia and Slovenia can settle this debt. 
We will have the succession process speeded up, as this is in 
the interest of both countries," said the Croatian prime 
minister. 
<H5>  Friendly Relations With Italy </H5>
  Speaking about the relations between the Republic of Croatia 
and Italy, Valentic said that the joint position of the two 
governments is that relations should be friendly, "because Italy 
is one of the most important European countries, and one of the 
most important neighbors must receive friendly treatment. We 
also established that no country can accept any discussion, let 
alone certain demands for the revision of the Osimo Accords, as 
it would mean changing the borders with all the negative 
consequences possible," said Prime Minister Nikica Valentic. 
  Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek said that a revision 
of 
relations and open issues was made. He stated that the last 
meeting in Zagreb, held in February, was successful, saying that 
"some of the difficult issues remained open then, such as the 
Krsko nuclear power plant. The agreements concerning the plant 
are being implemented, the financing is going well, and the 
talks related to property issues are under way." 
  With regard to Ljubljanska Banka in Zagreb, the positions 
are 
different. Drnovsek said that Slovenia wants the problem to be 
resolved within the succession of the former Yugoslavia, while 
Croatia has a different proposal. Both sides have been 
reviewing this problem, and some new solutions have been 
proposed. The next meeting of the representatives of the two 
countries is expected in June, which is when, as Drnovsek 
believes, there will be changes concerning the issue of 
Ljubljanska Banka.

<F P=106> [HINA report: "Granic Is Not Going to Belgrade"] </F>
  [Text] Dr. Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister of the Republic of Croatia, stated that Croatia would 
persist on the position that the international sanctions against 
the so-called FRY not be lifted or suspended unless the status 
of the UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] is resolved, and that he did 
not intend to go to Belgrade for the time being. 
  Minister Granic said this on 17 May, in the introductory 
speech at the session of the Foreign Policy Parliament 
Committee, at which he spoke about the present foreign political 
position of Croatia. Croatian ambassadors to the UN, the 
European Union, the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and Belgium, 
Germany, Turkey, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Slovenia also 
participated in the Committee activities. 
  The main topics of the 15th Committee session, chaired by 
Dr. 
Zarko Domljan, were the international position of Croatia, the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the Washington and Vienna 
agreements, and relations with the neighboring countries and 
international superpowers. 
  "Croatia has never been in a better international position 
than it is now," said Dr. Granic, adding that the procedure for 
accepting Croatia in the Council of Europe has been restarted, 
and that there have been announcements that economic 
arrangements with international financial institutions will be 
made. 
  Everybody present agreed that the main reasons for the 
improvement of the position of Croatia were the agreements 
between Croats and Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which, as Dr. 
Mario Nobilo, Croatian ambassador to the UN in New York, said, 
Croatia must strictly observe. He, like the other participants, 
said that Croatia is still in a very difficult position, and 
that the Bosniak- Croat federation is also a chance for Croatia 
to get closer to Europe. 
  Nobilo also emphasized the importance of the "clear and 
aggressive appearance" Croatia made before the international 
forces with the aim of changing the UNPROFOR mandate, and to 
channel the money spent on the "static preservation of the 
situation" in the UNPA's to financing the return of the refugees 
and the restoration of the country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Budisa Chairman, Kovacevic Secretary"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Osijek -- The second day of the Fifth Convention 
of the Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS] began with the 
election of the party president, vice presidents, secretary 
general, members of the Grand Council, and other posts. Several 
candidates were nominated for all posts, except that of 
president. Former [HSLS] President Drazen Budisa was reelected 
for the next two-year term. He received 914 out of 930 votes. 
Bozo Kovacevic, former secretary general of the party, was 
reelected to that post. Dr. Zlatko Kramaric, Velimir Terzic, 
Jozo Rados, and Mladen Vilfan were elected party vice 
presidents. Out of 88 candidates, the convention elected 33 
members of the Grand Council. Five members of the Statutory 
Committee and five members of the Control Committee were also 
elected. Kovacevic received 600 and Zoric 325 votes. Nine 
ballots were invalid. 
  While the votes were being counted, the convention continued 
to present and debate the resolutions of the convention, which 
encompassed many major issues concerning Croatia's development. 
The long and open debate and the proposing of amendments to the 
resolutions included many participants, so the debate on 
positions on the HSLS resolutions lasted well into the 
afternoon. For instance, as many as three proposals on the 
resolution on local administration and self-administration were 
made and a compromise version was adopted at the end. Among 
other things, a decision was made that the HSLS will advocate 
amending the Law on Local Self-Administration and Administration 
and the Law on the Territory of the Self-Administration Units in 
order to increase the power of local self-administration units 
regarding matters that are of interest to the citizens on their 
territory. The HSLS will devote special attention to isolated 
and underdeveloped insular and other regions, about which it 
demands financial help from the central state authorities.

  [Text] At today's news conference in Paris, French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe announced that Slovenia will be the only 
country from the former Yugoslavia at the Conference on 
Stability in Europe that will be given the status of a potential 
EU member. As REUTER reports, a decision about Slovenia's 
participation at this conference was made at the last moment, as 
our country was not on the list of nine invited central and 
Eastern European countries last week. 
  The French decision about this was also supported by 
Germany. 
It is known that our country, as opposed to Poland, the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Lituania, 
Latvia, and Estonia, has not signed the associate EU membership 
agreement yet.

<F P=106> [Article by Vida Kocjan: "How Will This Year's Budget Pie Be </F>
Divided?"; all figures as published] 
  [Text] On 6 May the State Assembly adopted the state 
budget, precisely according to the provisions of the rules of 
procedure, since they provide for it to be adopted within three 
days. In discussing the 130 amendments, the most important 
innovation is that the deputies adopted an amendment from the 
committee for infrastructure and thus provided for a 
1.3-billion-tolar [T] increase in the state treasury. The 
planned deficit thus increased from T11.8 billion to somewhat 
more than T12.8 billion, which means about 0.8 percent of the 
social product. The additional T1.3 billion will be used for 
maintaining regional and local roads. 
  The budget's framework is: 
  --T394.8 billion in revenues; 
  --T07.9 billion in expenditures; 
  --a deficit of T12.8 billion. 
  Through a government amendment the deputies allowed an 
increase in the State Council's material costs, increasing them 
by more than T8.5 million, and also increased other working 
expenditures by a little more than T4 million. This year the 
State Council will receive almost T138 million of the state pie. 
  At the government's suggestion, they added another T25 
million for the guardian of human rights, so that this job will 
now cost citizens more than T2.715 billion. 
  They took T200 million from the item on material costs for 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs and transferred it to the 
Ministry of Culture, which will use it for the Triglav National 
Park and other regional parks. Instead of T19.094 billion, the 
Interior Ministry will only cost us 18.995 billion, and T9.5748 
billion will now be spent on the Ministry of Culture. 
  For the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the deputies, within 
the 
framework of T4.2395 billion, transferred 40 million from the 
promotion item to financing Slovene minorities abroad. The 
overall amount remained unchanged. 
  For the Ministry of Defense, they increased material costs 
by 
T220 million and reduced by that amount the item on machinery 
and other equipment, capital maintenance of military equipment 
and weapons, and maintenance of material-technical resources. 
The deputies allocated more money for training the Territorial 
Defense reserves (by more than T68 million), financing the 
increase from other items for that ministry. They increased by 
T240 million the amount for feeding soldiers performing military 
service, obtaining that amount by redistributing items within 
the defense budget. This year's final amount for that ministry 
therefore remains the same -- T24.6545 billion. 
  At the government's suggestion, T87 million allocated for a 
research shaft for the underground storage of gas was taken away 
from the Ministry of Economic Activities and transferred to a 
new item for geothermal energy. There was a T163-million 
reduction in funds allocated for restructuring and preserving 
jobs. This year that ministry will receive somewhat less than 
T7.691 billion in state money (instead of the initially planned 
T7.8536 billion). 
  The Ministry of Agriculture received a T140-million increase 
in funds for the public forestry service, and likewise an 
additional 15 million for the comprehensive management of the 
countryside and the rebuilding of villages. Another T15 million 
was also added for winery roads, and almost as much for 
agricultural infrastructure. As a result, there was a 
T25-million reduction in the amount planned for the reclamation 
of Lendava-Crnec. This year T10.700 billion is expected to be 
allocated for that economic activity. 
  The Ministry of Transportation and Communications received 
the most. Because of new investments in regional and local 
roads, the public debt was increased by T1.3 billion. This year 
about T27.575 billion will be allocated by that ministry. 
  The deputies also adopted almost all the proposed amendments 
to the items for the Ministry of Labor. They increased subsidies 
for student food by T150.6 million, but reduced republic 
entitlements by T10 million and transferred them to preschool 
education for young Gypsies. For constructing new housing 
communities for the disabled (in Ljubljana and in Maribor), they 
added a new item in the amount of T32 million. That amount, 
however, was reduced by subsidies in the Ministry of Economic 
Relations and Development. This year that ministry will be 
allocated approximately T86.700 billion. 
  The Ministry of Education and Sport was allocated T1.4 
million for athletic scholarships, and that amount will increase 
the deficit further. This year the deputies allocated T62.148 
billion to that ministry. 
  From the state reserve funds, the Ministry of Finance was 
allocated T35 million to build a secondary school in Izola. This 
year that ministry will receive T115.6203 billion. 
  There were no major discussions about the other ministries. 
We can only single out the discussion about the items for the 
Ministry of Culture, in which the deputies rejected most of the 
proposed amendments. 
  We cannot overlook the fact that in the very first draft 
budget for this year, the president of the Republic of Slovenia, 
the State Assembly, and the Constitutional Court were given 
exactly as much money as they requested (T202.3 million, T2.0694 
billion, and T496.1 million, respectively). Consequently there 
was no discussion about the items for these three big consumers, 
and likewise they did not submit additional amendments.

<F P=106> [Report signed by "T.L." and "V.D.": "The Future of </F>
Macedonia Is in its Integration Into Europe"] 
  [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
visited Prilep today at the invitation of the dean of the Prilep 
Economics Faculty. In the crowded hall of the faculty President 
Gligorov talked to the students and businessmen of the town and 
the commune about foreign influences and the present situation 
in the state. "As a country that has achieved international 
legitimacy, as a member of the United Nations, Macedonia, being 
an independent state, must build its strategy from the positions 
that it takes on political and economic matters." This was the 
beginning of President Kiro Gligorov's speech. He then stressed 
the central location of our country and that this is why 
Macedonia and all the countries surrounding it must strive for 
peace in the Balkans. 
  "In the present situation we are burdened with worries about 
the blockades and embargoes, but the moment the borders open we 
shall see the real significance of Macedonia's position," 
President Gligorov emphasized. "If we construct good neighborly 
relations with the states surrounding us, our state will become 
a country of initiatives and economic advantages, and the 
potential for our economy will then come to full fruition. We 
wish no new divisions in the Balkans because they will keep the 
nations in permanent conflict. Our membership in the European 
Union is a must. It represents an enormous national market, a 
factor in the economic life of the Union's countries. Small 
countries always make their living by exchanging goods on big 
markets. 
  Macedonia is an open country -- it has proved this through 
its international activities and its efforts with neighboring 
and other European and world countries to include itself in the 
world's telecommunications system, to become a member of 
international institutions, and to construct railroads and roads 
to states with which it was not previously connected. 
  "An end must be put to the war," Gligorov said. "We must 
restructure the economic, political, and democratic processes 
with a view to coming close to Europe and following the European 
norms of development.... The essential privatization process, 
which is stagnant in the neighboring countries because of 
criminal and mafia activities, with their far-reaching 
consequences, must be implemented in our country in a democratic 
way through a permanent concern for the individual, even if 
democracy is not always ideal." 
  President Gligorov also spoke about the need for help from 
those financial institutions of which Macedonia is a member, 
about open borders and the free flow of ideas and goods, about 
the census, which is expected to demonstrate the real situation 
in the state, although now every kind of statistical 
manipulation is emerging from particular interests. 
  "I am not worried about the present situation because we 
have 
large horizons open in front of us and every attempt to attack 
or endangering Macedonia will be faced by great resistance and 
everybody is aware of the consequences that may arise in the 
Balkans and generally," President Gligorov said, and continued: 
"Others did not think that Macedonia could survive 
independently, first of all in the economic sense. 
Nevertheless, those ideas did not come about. The most 
important thing for us is not to let internal conflicts happen. 
We can overcome everything else.

Month"] 
  [Text] The general director of the Romanian customhouse 
Mihai Panzaru said that Romania is close to finishing the 
preparations for the opening of a customs corridor for Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. The 
realization of this endeavor is planned for the middle of next 
month. 
  The idea for a "customs corridor" which would connect 
Macedonia with the Western European countries, as it was 
emphasized in Bucharest, was given by the U.S. Administration, 
with the aim of helping Macedonia and carrying out its trade 
deals, which has been made difficult by the Greek embargo and 
the upholding of the sanctions against Federal Republic 
Yugoslavia. 
  Mihai Panzaru said "the corridor will span from Austria 
through Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, to Macedonia." He added 
that Romania has already discussed this with the Hungarian 
authorities, while the Bulgarian side is also expected to be 
contacted these days.

  [Text] The main hearing of the 10 Albanians, Macedonian 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] citizens, 
accused of forming paramilitary forces, started in Skopje, 
yesterday, with a proposition to abolish the imprisonment of 
suspects. Lawyers pointed out the court's right to hold them in 
custody has expired, which, as one lawyer stated, was anyhow 
opposed to the Macedonian constitution. Unless they are 
released, the defence threatened to demand disqualification of 
the District Court in Skopje, as well as of all other courts 
refusing to release the suspects. This proposal was rejected by 
the court with an explanation that the investigation procedure 
has been completed in due time, and the accusation has also been 
[words indistinct]. The hearing was interrupted after this, 
leaving time to the defence and the accused to discuss the 
demand for disqualification of the court. The next hearing is 
scheduled for May 30, and hearing of witnesses for June 7. Mr. 
Adolfo Ramirez, administrator of the U.S. Liaison Office in 
Skopje was also present at the hearing, as one of the suspects 
has double citizenship, Macedonian and American.

  [Text] Tirana, May 25 (ATA) -- The spokesman of the Foreign 
Ministry reports that the recent clamour raised by the Greek 
Government regarding the announcement of the Tirana Attorney's 
Office about the reasons of the arrest of six Albanian citizens 
of Greek origin, as well as the statement of the spokesman of 
the Greek Government about this question are unjustifiable and 
do not serve the normalization of relations between the two 
countries and doubts their tones have a direct impact of 
electoral passions. 
  According to its statements, the Greek Government has 
undertaken and may undertake further steps towards international 
forums such as the [UN] Security Council, European Union, CSCE 
and other forums, interpreting this legal action of Albania as a 
violation of the rights of the Greek minority in Albania. 
  The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of 
Albania declares that the Albanian Government is ready to 
welcome the sending of commissions from the Security Council, 
CSCE, European Union and other institutions for a direct 
observation of the reality having in their disposal the complete 
file of the Albanian Attorney's Office as well as other 
documents which prove both the keeping of arms by these persons 
without permission and their relations with the Greek secret 
service as well as other unconstitutional and secessionist 
activities. However, this will not be in the interest of Greece 
and of the joint efforts the two countries are making to 
overcome the existing contradictions and problems.

Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], Gligorov. This is their fourth 
meeting, but this time it is an informal meeting. Mr. Berisha 
and his wife welcomed President Gligorov and his wife in the 
governmental residence of Pogradec city. 
  The two presidents dwelt mainly on cooperation between the 
two countries and the situation in the region. Later, Berisha 
and Gligorov made statements for the press. Considering the 
meeting as very warm and friendly, Berisha said that: "Our 
conversation was open and friendly. We especially discussed 
cooperation between our two countries and agreed to make efforts 
to develop this cooperation further. We discussed the 
broadening of communication links and the establishment of the 
airline as a success in this relation. Both parties consider as 
necessary the signing of a series of other agreements, such as 
that of commodities' and passengers' transportation and that of 
connecting the two countries by a railway. Albania is ready to 
offer and has offered facilities to the Macedonian party for 
deposits up to 1,5 million tons of fuel in the Albanian ports as 
well as facilities for one million of other commodities. We 
also consider as very important the lifting of visas on both 
border areas at a distance of 20-25 kilometres, as it will be 
judged by the experts and this will be a first step towards the 
complete removal of visas. 
  "The signing of a series of other agreements on economic 
cooperation, on guaranteeing investments will help the two 
countries promote cooperation and develop friendly relations. 
"We also discussed political relations and the situation in the 
region. I personally hail President Gligorov's efforts in 
realizing the census and materializing the law on the census in 
Macedonia. Also, I hail his efforts in broadening the freedoms 
and rights of Albanians in this republic. The daily publication 
of the newspaper FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, the determination to 
enlarge the mass media, the opening of the faculty for teachers 
in Skopje, the enlargement of the middle school system, will 
increase the role of the Albanian factor in the stability and 
development of Macedonia. We also encourage the contribution of 
the Albanian political forces to the stability of Macedonia and 
governmental coalition. 
  "As regards developments in the region, both countries are 
determined to work for their integration into Europe and the 
European and West institutions. Both countries are resolute to 
overcome difficulties through dialogue. Cooperation between 
Albania and Macedonia is not only a bilateral but also a 
regional contribution." 
  Macedonian President Gligorov spoke at first on 
possibilities 
to develop cooperation between the two countries and stressed 
that "It is not normal for the two countries not to be connected 
by a railway. This way of transportation as well as the 
possibility offered by the Albanian party for the exploitation 
of its ports, will help develop cooperation between the two 
neighbouring countries." 
  President Gligorov declared before the reporters the 
predisposition of the Macedonian state to sign agreements 
between the two countries. "The agreements, he said, will 
consist in economic cooperation, guarantee of each other's 
investments, removal of double taxation, cultural cooperation 
and joint care for safety in the border, which allow the 
citizens of both countries to move freely to each other." 
  Concerning the Balkans, Gligorov said that "We have many 
reasons to try to maintain stability and peace in the region. 
It is to our merit that Albania and Macedonia were not involved 
in the conflict." President Gligorov considered the realisation 
of the census in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as a 
possibility for removing any kind of disagreement and considered 
the census as indispensable. He assessed the cooperation between 
the two countries as "Successful and with sure prospects." 
  After the dinner, Presidents Berisha and Gligorov, together 
with their wives, went for a visit to the city of Ohri.

<F P=106> ["Pool" report] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, May 24 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem leader 
Alija Izetbegovic on Tuesday [24 May] dismissed as utterly 
unacceptable the European Union (E.U.) plan on the territorial 
division of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
under which 51 per cent of the territory would go to the 
Moslem-Croat federation, and 49 per cent to the Serbs. 
  In a statement to Radio France International (RFI), whose 
programme was monitored in Belgrade, Izetbegovic said that the 
world's insistence on such a settlement implied a continuation 
of the war. Foreign ministers of the United States, Russia, 
Great Britain and the European `troika' (Belgium, Greece and 
Germany) accepted in mid-May the E.U. formula envisaging this 
division of the Bosnian territory. 
  The Bosnian Serbs, who owned 64 per cent of the territory 
before the outbreak of the war in 1992, now control 70 per cent. 
Izetbegovic described the forthcoming Geneva meeting of a 
Bosnian Moslem delegation with U.S. presidential envoy Charles 
Redman and the contact group for Bosnia not as negotiations, but 
simply as meetings in which Redman and the contact group would 
inform the Bosnian Moslem side about their stands. 
  The contact group, made up of U.S., Russian, E.U. and U.N. 
representatives, was set up in late April with the aim of 
restoring the Bosnian peace process. Izetbegovic took another 
opportunity to disparage special U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi and 
said that Akashi had fallen into oblivion and that he was 
already regarded as history in Bosnia.

  [Text] Poland's Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski sent a 
letter today to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wladyslaw Klaczynski told us. 
  [Begin Klaczynski recording] Minister Olechowski stressed 
Poland's concern caused by the present situation in Crimea and a 
possibility that an internal Ukrainian problem could become an 
international conflict. Poland is in favor of a peaceful 
resolution of the dispute within the framework of the democratic 
legal order, and it reiterates its support for Ukraine's 
independence and territorial integrity. 
  Poland counts, as Minister Olechowski writes in his letter, 
upon a similar position by all the CSCE states, but it is 
attaching particular importance to the position of the United 
States and Russia, which have pledged to guarantee the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Poland is 
also convinced as to the good will of Ukraine's Government and 
its readiness to find a peaceful and democratic solution to this 
dangerous dispute. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Ljube Profilski: "Promotion of Cooperation </F>
Between Two States"] 
  [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
and Albanian President Sali Berisha had "informal, but friendly" 
discussions yesterday, accompanied by their wives and 
delegations from the two states. The meeting of the two 
presidents, which was held on the territories of the two states, 
had a characteristic course and contents. At first, discussions 
were held at the presidential residence in the Albanian town of 
Podgradec by the side of Lake Ohrid. In the afternoon the 
Albanian delegation headed by President Berisha crossed the 
Albanian-Macedonian border for a short visit to Ohrid and made a 
tour of the cultural and historical monuments together with the 
Macedonian delegation headed by President Kiro Gligorov. 
  President Berisha welcomed Macedonian President Gligorov in 
front of the residence and the two presidents held private talks 
for an hour. After that the two delegations joined the 
discussions. Then Gligorov and Berisha went for a short walk 
along the side of the lake, stopping for a brief discussion near 
the lake. They held discussions without an interpreter. 
  After the discussions, both presidents made statements to 
journalists, assessing the talks as very positive, fruitful, and 
as a step forward in the development of relations between the 
two states. Moreover, we found out from unofficial sources that 
the talks were held in an open, friendly, and relaxed 
atmosphere, that a number of questions were raised, and that it 
was concluded that there were not and that there should not be 
open questions between the two states. We have also found out 
that President Berisha confirmed that Albania would support the 
admission of Macedonia to the CSCE. The Albanian side also 
supported the census in Macedonia. 
  In his statement to journalists Berisha said that he had 
invited President Gligorov, his wife, and his closest associates 
to spend the weekend together, so, as he put it, "the meeting is 
not official, but friendly, and I need hardly assure you that it 
is very positive. We have had open, friendly discussions and we 
talked particularly about cooperation between the two countries. 
We agreed to work on deepening this cooperation. 
Substantially, we talked about better communications between 
the two countries. The opening of the air traffic route 
Skopje-Tirana is very important." The two sides assessed the 
signing of a great number of agreements as very useful because 
they will promote this kind of cooperation. For instance, the 
transportation of goods and people by rail, and so on. 
  Sali Berisha also said that Albania was ready to help store 
1.5 million tonnes of fuel in Albanian ports and depots, as well 
as another million tonnes of other goods. "I think it is very 
important," he said, "to abolish visa requirements for the two 
border zones for a distance of 20 to 25 kilometers, on which the 
two sides will have to agree. This will be one of the initial 
steps toward a total abolition of visa requirements. The 
signing of other agreements, such as the one on economic 
cooperation and on guarantees for investment, will encourage 
better opportunities for the promotion of cooperation and 
friendship between the two states." 
  "We," Berisha said, " discussed political cooperation, too, 
as well as relations in the Balkans. I personally welcome the 
efforts of President Gligorov to carry out the census in 
Macedonia and to pass the law on the census, as well as for the 
further promotion of the rights of Albanians in Macedonia, for 
the daily publication of the newspaper "Flaka et Vllazerimit," 
for the expansion of radio and television broadcasts in the 
Albanian language, for opening a faculty for teachers in Skopje, 
for the expansion of the secondary school system, and so on. 
All these will increase the role of the Albanian factor for the 
stability of Macedonia and of the Albanian population in 
Macedonia. We also encourage the contribution of the Albanian 
political forces in Macedonia within the framework of the 
government coalition to the stability of the state. We also 
discussed the development of the situation in the region. Both 
countries are resolute in their efforts to be integrated into 
Europe and European institutions. At the same time, both 
countries are resolute in overcoming the present difficulties 
through dialogue. Ultimately, we think that the cooperation 
between Albania and Macedonia represents a contribution not only 
on the bilateral, but also on the regional plane. President 
Gligorov has invited me for an official visit to Macedonia, 
which I have accepted with pleasure," Berisha said in conclusion. 
  President Kiro Gligorov told the journalists that the two 
delegations had discussed a number of questions related to 
further cooperation in all fields in an unofficial but friendly 
atmosphere on this beautiful day. "In this respect," Gligorov 
said, "we have a broad understanding of the need to promote 
cooperation between the two neighboring countries, for which we 
have concluded that there are a lot of possibilities and a lot 
of reasons. The absence of a railroad track connecting our two 
neighboring countries is not normal. That is a remnant of the 
past. The most fruitful cooperation is cooperation between 
neighbors in the first place. Such things as a railroad track, 
with the possibility of using the ports in Albania, as we have 
been offered here, open perspectives for promoting overall 
economic cooperation. In addition, after the establishment of 
diplomatic relations at the highest level, our relations need 
legal regulation. In order to build relations on a long-term 
basis it is necessary to have regular cooperation in all fields. 
It can help not only the promotion of economic cooperation but 
also the security of the borders. We spoke of an agreement on 
economic cooperation, on guarantees for mutual investment in 
order to avoid double taxation, an agreement on cultural 
cooperation, and mutual care for the borders and a gradual 
increase of traffic there." 
  "All the neighboring countries," Gligorov continued, "ease 
traffic and economic cooperation between people at the borders. 
We have to urge the experts in this direction, to make them sit 
down and discuss that. Concerning our cooperation in the 
Balkans, we have concluded there are many reasons for 
maintaining peace and stability. We have remained outside this 
senseless war and I think we have to secure this. That is 
another reason for good cooperation. It is of extraordinary 
importance to take the necessary measures in each country for 
the Albanians in Macedonia and the Macedonians in Albania to 
feel they are in their own state, and our mutual assessment was 
that the implementation of the census will cancel one item from 
the agenda that was causing or could cause misunderstandings. 
In each country it is necessary to know the number of citizens 
who consider themselves Albanians or Macedonians; in each 
country they are citizens who must enjoy all their rights and 
have all their responsibilities. This and the atmosphere at our 
discussions, with a common European orientation, must represent 
a reason for the respective ministries to meet; we must urge 
more frequent and more successful meetings between our 
economists, as well as other delegations, in order to construct 
an atmosphere of greater confidence day by day." 
  "The official visit of President Berisha to Macedonia will 
be 
of great importance. So far all our meetings have produced 
results and proved our good relations. I hope that at the next 
official visit of Sali Berisha to Macedonia we shall make a step 
forward. I am grateful for the cordial hospitality," Gligorov 
said. 
  After lunch at the residence both delegations left for Ohrid 
where they visited cultural and historical monuments. 
Presidents Gligorov and Berisha visited Saint Clement's Church, 
the gallery of icons in the church, and Saint Sofia's Church, 
and then they took a walk in the old part of the town as far as 
the port. In a good mood and in nice weather President Berisha 
showed a special interest in Ohrid's historical sights. After a 
short rest in the "Biljana" residence in Ohrid, Sali Berisha 
returned to Albania.

  [Excerpts] The delegation of the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic ended its official visit to Moscow, during which 
it extended an invitation to Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the lower 
chamber of the Russian State Duma, to visit Slovakia. Before 
leaving the Russian capital Jan Smihula, our resident 
correspondent, interviewed Ivan Laluha, chairman of the Duma's 
foreign committee. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Smihula] There is a great deal of talk 
about Russia's role in the European security system and 
specifically about her special status within the Partnership for 
Peace program. 
  [Laluha] This was also the subject of our discussions. There 
is some confusion among Russian deputies because they have not 
been informed in a greater detail about the substance of the 
latest specific proposals put forward by representatives of the 
Russian Government. During our talks with the deputy foreign 
minister at the Foreign Ministry I received assurance that there 
do not exist any conditions from Russia either to NATO or to the 
Partnership for Peace program that could provoke fears about the 
security situation in our geopolitical area. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik is chairing the 
Slovak Government's regular session today -- its 12th session, 
to be precise. The cabinet should discuss about 20 points, 
including the new version of the defense doctrine. [passage 
omitted] Michal Tvarozek reports: 
  [Tvarozek] [passage omitted] I asked Defense Minister Pavol 
Kanis for an interview. First of all, I put it to him that the 
defense doctrine was already on the agenda of the previous 
government -- the government dealt with it at the beginning of 
March this year. Has anything in the doctrine been changed by 
the Moravcik cabinet? 
  [Begin recording] [Kanis] This new version of the doctrine 
is 
quite different in that the draft passed by the government 
today, albeit passed with the proviso that certain appended 
comments should be taken into account, spells out clearly the 
foreign policy affiliation of the Slovak Republic. The emphasis 
is on closer relations with and on the future membership of 
western European and transatlantic defense structures. 
  The new version includes a foreign policy section and many 
things in it have been clarified and are now expressed clearly. 
There are none of those general cliches we saw in the variant 
discussed by the previous government. 
  [Tvarozek] At the moment, an all-European defense system is 
being set up. Does it mean that our defense doctrine has a time 
limit? 
  [Kanis] This is an important point: just for how long should 
the defense doctrine be valid? We are going through a stage 
when we are coming closer to Western European and transatlantic 
defense structures and our defense doctrine will therefore be 
valid up to the moment that we become a member of these 
structures. As soon as we become a member of these structures 
we will adopt their military doctrine as well. 
  If we take into account the fact that the Slovak Republic 
has 
the weakest military potential, the weakest economic and even 
the weakest human potential, then our thinking must recognize 
that the first prerequisite of our successful defense is our 
membership of some collective defense system. In other words, 
one has to emphasize that it is, above all, our successes in 
foreign policy and in foreign-defense policy that constitute a 
guarantee of our security. 
  [Tvarozek] In connection with this document, the government 
today also discussed the so-called presentation document 
[prezentacny dokument]. What is it? 
  [Kanis] Just as the defense doctrine is a kind of pillar as 
regards our internal political activity and our own forces, the 
presentation document is the concrete expression of the 
Partnership for Peace framework document -- and therefore the 
second pillar on which our security is based. This document is 
extremely important because it gives concrete expression to the 
framework document and in fact also expresses our 
self-projection and self-reflection regarding our security up to 
the end of the millennium. The defense doctrine and the 
presentation document therefore constitute the basic documents 
of our security and defense policy. On their basis a specific 
security policy for this millennium will be implemented. [end

  [Excerpt] The Coalition Council met in Bratislava today 
under the chairmanship of Jozef Moravcik, the Slovak prime 
minister and chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia. It 
discussed the course to be taken by the Slovak Republic in the 
drafting of documents on the security initiative named as the 
pact of stability and other topical issues. Regarding 
Slovakia's participation in meetings of the stability pact, the 
Coalition Council agreed that Slovakia would be represented by a 
governmental delegation. This also applies to the opening 
meeting of the stability pact planned to take place next 
Thursday and Friday. The Coalition Council regard the solution 
of the problem of minorities as an internal matter of the state, 
although representatives of the Hungarian political parties 
voiced their demand to be allowed to participate in the meetings 
of the stability pact. However, it will be up to the government 
to decide who should form Slovakia's Government delegation.

not given: "Is the Slovak National Party Going Back?; Possible 
Background of a Surprising Recommendation"] 
  [Text] The Slovak National Party [SNS] Central Council 
made two important decisions on 14 May, albeit only in the form 
of recommendations for the delegates to the forthcoming party 
assembly. The first recommendation concerns an amendment to the 
SNS statutes, which should make it absolutely clear that the SNS 
is a national party. This would actually represent a return to 
the SNS statutes in the form in which they existed before 
Ludovit Cernak's chairmanship. The proposal that only a Slovak 
be allowed to be party member aroused particular interest. 
  SNS Chairman Jan Slota expressed this in the following 
terms: 
  "....we have clearly laid down that only a member of the 
Slovak nation can be member of the SNS." 
  [Olach] No one of a different nationality can join the 
party? 
  [Slota] Probably not, assuming that the assembly approves 
the statutes in this form. The SNS is a national party and it 
is its national character that we must guard first and foremost. 
We are one of the purest national states, with 85 percent of 
the people living in Slovakia being Slovaks. 
  [Olach] Will this not be damaging to the party's reputation? 
  [Slota] This will be used as an argument by people who wage 
a struggle against everything national. When France passed a 
law enforcing French in a tough way, no one from the Council of 
Europe protested. 
  [Olach] How do you intend to check the Slovak nationality of 
your members? 
  [Slota] You are now taking me at my word. When someone says 
that he is a Slovak, we will believe him. We do not have the 
staff to investigate those things. 
  [Olach] SNS Honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes, who lost to Jan 
Slota the contest for SNS chairmanship after the post had been 
vacated by Ludovit Cernak, is more tolerant regarding the 
requirement for party members to be of Slovak nationality. 
  [Prokes] In no case will there be any nationalist 
tendencies. We want to uplift the Slovak nation, which does not 
mean that we are going to suppress anyone. 
  [Olach] However, the fact that only a member of the Slovak 
nation can join the party limits the rights of other 
nationalities. 
  [Prokes] This depends on the definition of terms. The 
proposal for changes to the party statutes refers to members of 
the Slovak nation and to Slovaks respectively. When a citizen 
of the Slovak Republic fills in a form in a Western country, it 
is common for him to write "Slovak" in the "nationality" [last 
word in English] column. 
  [Olach] Hence, the SNS is not closing its doors to 
minorities, in your opinion? 
  [Prokes] In my opinion, it is not. 
  [Olach] It thus seems that the demand [that SNS membership 
be restricted to Slovaks] is aimed more at satisfying the 
membership base than as a declarative demand aimed at the 
general public and that no one will be expelled from the SNS 
because of his non-Slovak nationality. And, indeed, why should 
he, given the fact that -- according to pre-election polls -- 
the SNS must fear for its place in parliament (in the last poll 
it received 4 percent). All the more surprising was the second 
recommendation of the SNS Central Council to the forthcoming 
assembly, namely that the SNS enter the elections independently. 
It was expected that the SNS would form a coalition with the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], which would 
automatically guarantee its place in parliament. According to 
Jan Slota, this decision was not rash but the result of many 
rounds of talks and many analyses. It should supposedly benefit 
both the SNS and the HZDS. 
  There is talk about Vladimir Meciar's objections to you on 
the ground of your excessive nationalist radicalism. 
  [Slota] I raised also this issue in my talks with Vladimir 
Meciar. He always replied that he did not have any 
reservations. I realize, however, that a coalition with our 
party is unacceptable to some HZDS supporters. We have figured 
out that both the HZDS and we will gain more if we enter the 
elections on our own. 
  [Olach] Are you not afraid of failing to cross the 5-percent 
threshold needed to get into the parliament? 
  [Slota] Not in the least. The Slovak spirit is not dead. 
Developments in southern Slovakia will help us. 
  [Olach] Mr. Slota is alluding here to the prepared bills on 
[birth and marriage] registers and bilingual signs, which, 
according to the SNS, are the product of a secret pact with the 
ethnic Hungarian political parties. Slovaks living in 
ethnically mixed territories along with citizens of Hungarian 
nationality are to be the main "target" of the SNS campaign. 
  [Slota] Those 800,000 Slovaks are totally endangered. The 
state-forming nation must fear on its own territory for its bare 
existence. The Magyarization continues uninhibited. 
  [Olach] Jan Slota also mentions the argument, heard before, 
about "Hungarian money from Budapest," for which 60 to 70 
percent of the property [in ethnically mixed areas] in the first 
wave of privatization was privatized. This can supposedly be 
proven in the pertinent companies. The SNS expects much from 
its educational policy. According to Jan Slota, the party's 
idea of tackling the problem of education in southern Slovakia 
is: "I swear by God, if we gain a fair percentage of the vote, 
we will resolve this problem in a fundamental way." 
  [Olach] But a solution at the expense of already existing 
schools with Hungarian as the language of instruction would 
surely be of no benefit! 
  [Slota] Believe me, we are going to resolve this as a 
priority and at any price. In every little village in which 
there is only one little Slovak pupil, this Slovak pupil must be 
taught in Slovak. 
  [Olach] Well, the SNS is obviously playing the "Hungarian 
card." But so does the HZDS, which will not be to the benefit 
of peaceful inter-ethnic relations. It is scarcely imaginable 
that the two parties will not compete [for the same type of 
voter]. It seems, however, that something like a little faction 
of Jozef Prokes is taking shape within the SNS, which supports a 
coalition with the HZDS. During the vote on the proposal to 
enter the elections independently, this faction abstained. How 
does Jozef Prokes, as a member of Vladimir Meciar's shadow 
cabinet, see the situation? 
  [Prokes] In my opinion, the sum total of votes would be 
greater if we formed a coalition with the HZDS. 
  [Olach] Everything will be decided at the SNS assembly in 
Komarno on 4 June. It seems, however, that SNS deputies have 
already become used to cooperating with the HZDS and some of 
them, such as Jozef Prokes and Marian Andel, also to posts in 
the cabinet, even if today it is only a shadow one. They 
perceive the chance of winning seats in the government as more 
realistic when the SNS enters the election in tandem with the 
HZDS.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Slovak National Party Standpoint: Threat of </F>
Manipulation"] 
  [Text] The Slovak National Party leadership sharply 
protests the planned amendment to the election law, which does 
not provide for the delivery of the ballot papers directly to 
voters' homes. The change to the election law, on the basis of 
which every voter would receive the ballot papers only at the 
polling station, would enable real manipulation of the elections 
and could result in the distortion of election results. Besides, 
the situation during the elections would be confusing because if 
any citizen did not arrive at the polling station for one reason 
or another, his ballot could be misused.

  [Text] Bratislava -- Questions ascertaining citizens' 
interest in participating in elections to the National Council 
of the Slovak Republic, as well as their electoral preferences, 
were part of a survey conducted by the Slovak Statistical Office 
from 2 to 10 May 1994. 
  The survey's results confirm citizens' unceasingly high 
degree of interest in participating in the elections. Three out 
of four respondents said that they would definitely or probably 
go to the polls. The percentage of voters who are not sure 
about their own participation in the elections has stabilized 
over the last three months at a level of 6 to 7 percent.

<F P=106>   [Interview with Pal Csaky, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Christian Democratic Movement Club of Deputies, by Jana 
Pankovcinova; place and date not given: "The Hungarian 
Coalition Will Support the Law on Bilingual Signs"] 
  [Text] At the May meeting of the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic, deputies are expected to discuss the 
government- sponsored amendment to the law on the official 
language, under which, in communities in which the Hungarian 
minority represents at least 20 percent of the population, it 
will be possible to use the name of the community in the 
language of the minority in accordance with a list of community 
names that has been drawn up. This amendment is being referred 
to as the law on bilingual signs. We have asked Pal Csaky, 
chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] 
Club of Deputies, whether the Hungarian coalition will support 
the bill in parliament. 
  [Csaky] We have proposed several times that the limit be 
lowered to 10 percent. We did not propose this for the sake of 
the Hungarian minority, but in the interest of the other ethnic 
minorities in the Slovak Republic. Should, however, only a 
limit of 20 percent guarantee the passage of this much-needed 
law, we will accept this and will give our support to the bill. 
I hope that the bill will be passed, although there are still 
some problems. These should be sorted out predominantly at the 
political level. 
  [Pankovcinova] What problems do you have in mind? 
  [Csaky] The list of admissible names in the language of 
minorities that is to constitute a separate supplement to the 
law will contain the Slovak and Hungarian names of communities. 
Experts are now holding discussions on what name to give every 
community. I do not consider this approach fortunate. The name 
that is being used at present should be accepted, in my opinion. 
After all, the law's objective is to calm passions and to give 
citizens a feeling of being at home. 
  [Pankovcinova] You are talking about calming passions. Are 
you not afraid of the opposite? When the same bill was 
discussed in the National Council of the Slovak Republic several 
months ago, the plenum approved the motion by a Slovak National 
Party deputy that the limit be raised to 30 percent, which 
eventually blocked the bill's passage. Is there no danger of 
the same situation recurring? 
  [Csaky] The 20 percent limit is the maximum in Europe. In 
Finland, for example, the limit is 7 percent. Slovakia is in 
store for a bitter election struggle, in which everything, 
including this law, will be used and misused. This is also 
signalled by the counter-proposal put forward by deputy J. Rea 
(Movement for a Democratic Slovakia). This counter-proposal 
only repeats the proposals made by the former government of 
Vladimir Meciar, which are unacceptable to us. I am calling for 
wisdom and tolerance. If we really think that Slovak society 
should become more democratic, then no one can object when, at 
the points of entry and exit of a community, the name of the 
community is given also in the language of the minority. The 
Slovak name will remain the official name of the community that 
will be used on maps, in telephone directories, bus and train 
schedules, etc., even though former Minister of Transportation 
and Communications Hofbauer misleads the public by claiming the 
opposite.

<F P=106> ["SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA"-signed report: "In a Letter to </F>
Government and the Parliament, Heritage Foundation Members 
Demand Respect for the Rights of Slovaks"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- The Slovak Heritage Foundation 
District Committee in Komarno urgently draws attention to the 
fact that the statements by politicians of ethnic Hungarian 
parties and movements in Slovakia about tolerance are insincere. 
In the course of the preceding years, they have repeatedly 
demonstrated that their idea of coexistence are permanent 
concessions by the Slovaks and the implementation of their own 
escalating demands. This has found its expression in the 
massive renaming of streets according to "personalities" from 
the time of the Hungarian empire, in tough Magyarization, and in 
incessant demands for the renaming of towns and villages. 
  Cases of job applicants being turned down because they are 
Slovaks and do not speak Hungarian are multiplying. The 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement has not abandoned its 
efforts to divide Catholics along ethnic lines by setting up a 
bishopric in Komarno exclusively for Hungarian believers. The 
Hungarian language is pushing Slovak out of schools. We 
therefore appeal to the Government of the Slovak Republic and 
deputies to the National Council of the Slovak Republic to 
ensure that politicians of Hungarian parties and movements in 
Slovakia meet the needs and requirements of the Slovak part of 
the population. 
  We demand that all competent representatives of the demands 
of the Slovak Heritage Foundation Committee [as published], as 
well as demands formulated in the Memorandum of Slovaks from 
Southern Slovakia be considered during the discussion of laws 
dealing with the so-called problem of bilingual signs, the 
problem of birth and marriage registers, and the problem of the 
Slovak state language. 
  In conclusion, the Slovak Heritage Foundation District 
Committee writes that many Slovaks see their prospects in 
southern Slovakia endangered, also due to the disregard for the 
demands of Slovaks by some contemporary highest representatives.

  [Excerpts] We have decided to quit the Green Party in 
Slovakia because we could no longer in silence carry before the 
public joint responsibility for the direction the party was 
taking -- the party's open support for the Party of the 
Democratic Left [SDL]. This was stated at a news conference 
held today by Jaroslav (Cantos), a member of the preparatory 
committee of the Slovak Green Party, when he talked about the 
formation of this new political entity in Slovakia. Our 
reporter Otto Goerner has more details. 
  [Goerner] The preparatory committee of the Slovak Green 
Party 
has issued a statement in regard to this step which says, among 
other things, that for the reasons given above, as well as due 
to certain differences of views on the approach to tackling 
certain environmental issues, they have decided to form a new 
party. They also see in this a new alternative for those voters 
who want to support green philosophy but who at the same time 
find it unacceptable to give their votes to the SDL. The new 
party also provides an opportunity for those members who had 
decided to quit the party following the formation of the 
coalition with the SDL. The necessary one thousand signatures 
that are required for the party to be registered at the Interior 
Ministery had been collected last week and the party has lodged 
an application at the Interior Ministry. [passage omitted] 
  In the coming parliamentary elections the new Slovak Green 
Party wants to appeal primarily to the parties of the national 
block. The new party will in no case however refuse to 
cooperate in technical matters with the other Green Party.

  [Excerpts] In the Journalists' House in Bratislava this 
morning the chairmen of the Party of the Democratic Left, the 
Social Democratic Party of Slovakia, the Slovak Green Party, and 
the Farmers' Movement signed a coalition agreement on election 
and postelection cooperation. The leaders of these political 
entities said that the signing of the coalition agreement is the 
first decision of this kind taken on the Slovak political scene 
and that it is the first step toward shaping the Slovak 
political scene in line with a normal West European model. 
  Democratic Left [PDL] Party Chairman Peter Weiss answered 
questions concerning the future of the bloc of left-wing parties 
put to him by editor Ivan Samel: 
  [Begin recording] [Samel] Mr. Chairman, are you not afraid 
that this bloc might encounter a fate similar to that 
encountered by the Democratic Party when the rightwing parties 
tried to merge? [Words indistinct] 
  [Weiss] We are neither merging nor uniting. What we want is 
cooperation. Our considerations are based on the fact that 
today's signing of the coalition agreement between these four 
political parties is an important event on the Slovak political 
scene which is still lacking its final shape and the evolution 
of which is still in the making. [passage omitted] 
  We are optimists. We intend to turn this coalition into an 
instrument of election victory. 
  [Samel] Do you contemplate a possibility of a further 
enlargement of the campaign bloc? 
  [Weiss] All the four partners proposed that the Association 
of Workers of Slovakia should join an open coalition. Although 
the proposal was not accepted, our offer on post-election 
cooperation is still on the table. It is up to the Association 
of Workers of Slovakia to decide. 
  [Samel] On more than one occasion you have expressed a 
willingness to cooperate with the present coalition partners in 
the government even after the elections. After concluding the 
coalition, do you regard that option as being still open or 
topical? 
  [Weiss] It is a likely option, but one naturally cannot jump 
the result of the elections. We would like to emerge from the 
elections in a situation which would allow us to say who will be 
our coalition partners. Of course, much will depend on how the 
present government coalition performs. So far, we have been 
able to overcome all natural differences of views that exist 
among the left, the center, and the rightwing coalition 
partners, by holding rational and civilized discussions. [end 
recording]

Station"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- The three stages of the gradual 
reconstruction of the V-1 nuclear power station at Jaslovske 
Bohunice will require costs of 11.3 billion korunas [Sk]. The 
first stage will involve the revalidation of safety-related 
installations and systems that are to be used in further 
operation of the unit. The second stage will focus on enhancing 
the capacity of the emergency systems and the cooling of the 
active zone for the primary circuit. The aim of the third stage 
is to enhance the capacity of the system for confining an 
accident. The reconstruction costs will be divided into 
individual years according to the cost-intensiveness of needed 
investments. A sum of Sk315 million will be appropriated in 
1994, Sk3.07 billion in 1995, Sk3.25 billion in 1996, Sk3.15 
billion in 1997, and Sk1.515 billion in 1998.

<F P=106> [HINA report on a statement by Kresimir Zubak, leader of the </F>
Bosnian Croat negotiating team, in Geneva; date not given: "`We 
Are Not Giving the Corridor to the Serbs'"] 
  [Text] "We have coordinated our positions with those of 
the Muslim delegation and established the starting points for 
the negotiations with the Serb side, but we do not expect that 
any significant progress will be made in the peace talks," said 
Kresimir Zubak, leader of the negotiation team of the Bosnian 
Croats, before the three-day peace talks between the delegations 
of the three warring sides and the members of the contact group 
for Bosnia- Herzegovina that, on the initiative of the United 
States, will be held beginning Tuesday evening behind closed 
door in Talloires, a French town near Geneva. 
  The Croat delegation, accompanied by the Croatian ambassador 
in Geneva, Dr. Miomir Zuzul, met with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic on Tuesday morning in Geneva to 
establish a joint negotiating position regarding the territorial 
demarcation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Zubak said that the Croat and Bosniak delegations would 
support the maps established by the Vienna agreement, which 
anticipates 58 percent of the territory for the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and 42 percent for the Bosnian 
Serbs. The Croat and Bosniak delegations are prepared to 
discuss the possibility of a compromise and the division of the 
territory into 51 and 49 percent, as stated in the European plan. 
  With regard to the so-called corridor, the position of the 
Croat and Bosniak delegations is that, in principle, the Serbs 
being given a corridor is out of the question, as the Croats and 
the Muslims would then also demand certain corridors going 
through Serb territories, said Zubak. However, he added, if the 
international community insists on this, there is a possibility 
of introducing free roads in Bosnia-Herzegovina, under UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] control, in accordance with the solutions 
contained in the Vance-Owen plan. 
  As far as the talks on the future political and legal 
organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina are concerned, we are 
prepared to discuss all the possible solutions, including the 
Serb side joining the federation, or a loose Bosnia-Herzegovina 
union consisting of the Croat-Bosniak federation and the future 
Serb republic, as stated in the Vance-Owen plan, said Zubak.

  [Text] Talloires, May 25 (TANJUG) -- Foreign minister of 
the Bosnian Serb Republic Aleksa Buha said on Wednesday that the 
Bosnian Serb delegation told the contact group that a ceasefire 
must be established first in the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that the territorial delimitation would 
be resolved later. The contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
began separate talks in the French tourist resort of Talloires, 
close to the Swiss border, on Wednesday with two delegations -- 
of Moslems and Croats and of the Bosnian Serbs. 
  The official platform for the talks is the Geneva 
declaration 
signed on May 13 by ministers of the United States, Russia and 
the European Union (E.U.), it was announced. Under this 
declaration, the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina are urged 
to sign a four-month ceasefire, during which time they would 
agree on the division of the territory of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina according to the E.U. formula of 49 percent 
for the Serbs and 51 percent for the Moslem-Croat federation. 
  In a statement to Bosnian Serb television, Buha said that 
the 
talks today had primarily focused on territorial delimitation. 
He said that the Bosnian Serb delegation had insisted that 
other criteria, in addition to the one of percentage of 
population, be also taken into consideration in the 
delimitation. These criteria include property, resources, and 
certainly, the one of functionality of the two future states in 
the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Moslem-Croat 
federation and the Serb Republic, he said. According to land 
registers, 64 percent of the land in Bosnia- Herzegovina is 
owned by Serbs. 
  "It is my impression that the members of the contact group 
are very interested in these arguments and I believe that, if 
they have not accepted them, then that they have seriously taken 
them into consideration. It remains to be seen what will come 
out in the end," Buha said. The contact group includes 
diplomats from the United States, Russia, Great Britain, France 
and Germany. 
  Buha said that the Bosnian Serb delegation had made it clear 
at the very beginning that it considered the international 
conference on former Yugoslavia as the valid body, and that the 
contact group could only be a place where views will be 
exchanged and possible new suggestions be made. The members of 
the contact group "have accepted such a role and they did not 
have any greater ambitions than to be part of the diplomatic 
process within the conference on former Yugoslavia," Buha said. 
  Representatives of Bosnian Moslems and Croats said upon 
arrival in Talloires that they would demand 58 percent of the 
territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina for their federation, but 
foreign agencies reported that they had agreed later during the 
day to discuss the division of territory on the basis of 51 
percent for the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for the 
Serb state. Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic announced 
ahead of the talks in Talloires that the Moslem side would 
negotiate and wage war until it wins 58 percent of the territory 
of former Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mariya Tsenkova from the National </F>
Assembly] 
  [Text] This is an Assembly session that will be decisive 
for the government. At the beginning of today's session Filip 
Dimitrov, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], made a 
statement on behalf of his faction in which he asked Prime 
Minister Berov to resign. An attempt to repeat the 
no-confidence vote will be viewed by the SDS deputies as a 
violation of the Constitution. If this is allowed it will 
represent a danger for Bulgaria's democracy, Dimitrov said. 
  Replying to the statement, Velko Vulkanov of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] demanded that the 19 May vote on 
structural and personnel changes in the government be annulled, 
and asked National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov to 
resign for what Vulkanov described as a violation of 
parliamentary practice. 
  BSL leader Zhan Videnov assured the hall -- the SDS deputies 
and Aleksandur Yordanov had already walked out -- that there 
will be a debate on the draft resolution proposed by the 
government on a framework agreement with parliament. 
  The political forces that support the cabinet are now 
holding 
consultations at the invitation of Prime Minister Berov, who 
still has not come to the National Assembly. It appears that 
the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] will participate in 
the consultations. The deputies of the New Alliance for 
Democracy [NSD] are divided. Part of them will probably 
participate in the consultations, while others demand separate 
talks with the prime minister.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mariya Tsenkova from the National </F>
Assembly] 
  [Text] The situation here continues to unfold. Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov met in the parliament with Zhan Videnov, 
leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], and Ahmed Dogan, 
leader of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS]. After the 
meeting Dogan said that the DPS will support the framework 
agreement proposed by the government, if it is supported by at 
least four parliamentary factions. Dogan did not specify what 
factions precisely should support the agreement, but he does not 
exclude a situation in which the cabinet will have to resign. 
  According to Zhan Videnov, procedural issues were discussed 
at the meeting with Prime Minister Berov on consultations 
between the prime minister and the parliamentary factions. 
  Nora Ananieva said that real consultations are yet to be 
held, and it appears that precisely this is taking place at 
present at the National Assembly's West Hall, where the prime 
minister is meeting with BSP representatives and two 
representatives of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD]. Mr. 
Oktay of the DPS entered the hall, saw what is happening there, 
left the hall, and refused to make any statements. 
  Dr. Yordan Todorov of the NSD said that he is attending the 
meeting as a representative of his faction, but the NSD will 
nevertheless insist on holding separate talks with the prime 
minister. 
  Deputy Ivan Pushkarov has not been offered the post of 
deputy 
prime minister. If signing an agreement is on the agenda, 
Pushkarov's people will not sign. It is not the business of the 
prime minister to make such moves, Pushkarov said. Several 
seconds ago Yunal Lyutfi of the DPS joined the meeting that is 
taking place at the National Assembly's West Hall.

  [Text] At an extraordinary closed meeting today, the 
government adopted the draft framework agreement with the 
parliament that was proposed by Prime Minister Berov. It will 
be in effect until new parliamentary and municipal elections are 
held in the fall. 
  The Executive Bureau of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
and the leadership of the BSP parliamentary faction discussed 
the framework agreement. It was agreed to support the segment 
that deals with setting a term for early parliamentary and 
municipal elections in the fall. The Socialists will also 
support the commitments of the Council of Ministers in the 
social sphere and its efforts to successfully end the 
negotiations on the country's foreign debt. They think the 
amendments to the Privatization Bill and a program on social and 
mass privatization should be adopted in June, while the Law on 
Defense and Armed Forces, amendments to the Election Bill, the 
Municipal Administration Bill, the Judicial Act, and the 
Constitution should be adopted in July. 
  In the decision that was adopted the Socialists committed 
themselves to supporting the personnel changes envisaged in the 
framework agreement and have proposed a candidate for the post 
of deputy prime minister.

  [Text] The news conference that ended a few minutes ago at 
134 Rakovski Street [headquarters of the Union of Democratic 
Forces, SDS] in Sofia concentrated on the fact that 
constitutional order in the country is under threat. 
  Prime Minister Berov suffered a vote of censure on 19 May 
but 
failed to offer his resignation, SDS leader Filip Dimitrov 
declared. What is more, he added, parliament's refusal to 
accept the cosmetic changes proposed by the prime minister 
represent a new vote of no confidence in him, in the sense of 
Article 112, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution. Dimitrov added 
that Berov is also attempting to infringe on Article 8 of the 
country's basic law, which regulates the division of powers. In 
his view, the cabinet is therefore governing without legal 
foundation, while parliament is supporting this lawlessness. It 
is clear that in this dramatic situation we will demand standard 
solutions, Dimitrov declared, but he did not reveal the tactical 
steps that the SDS has in mind. He appealed to the media to be 
more energetic in acting to end the lawlessness in the country.

  [Text] Konstantin Trenchev, chairman of the Podkrepa Labor 
Confederation, today met with Ahmed Dogan, leader of the 
Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS], and informed him that 
continuing support for this cabinet is politically damaging and 
that the cabinet has clearly demonstrated its inability to rule 
the country. 
  After the meeting Konstantin Trenchev told reporters about 
this position. The meeting was requested by Ahmed Dogan. 
Probably at its next Federative Council Podkrepa will review 
its relations with the DPS, because it appears that the movement 
is cooperating with the Communists in its decision to support 
the cabinet, Dr. Trenchev said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross by </F>
Gabriel Oszy-Toth; place and date not given: "Governing Is Not 
a Triumphal March for Anyone -- Boross on the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum's Election Fiasco, Handing Over Power, and 
Being in Opposition"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Oszy-Toth] In recent 
months the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] has been talking 
constantly about the danger of a left-wing restoration. This 
was emphasized in all campaign meetings, interviews, and 
television interviews. Do you think that your election campaign 
was flawed? 
  [Boross] I do not believe that our campaign was basically 
mistaken. In my view, the electors did not vote mainly on the 
basis of the parties' campaigns. This is proved by the fact 
that in certain areas the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
candidates did not even conduct a campaign -- as we learned from 
their reports. Nevertheless, they automatically received the 
votes. It is a fact that, tactically, the MDF could have 
conducted a better campaign, I have no doubts about this. 
However, I do not think that this is a decisive factor. We had 
a stable government for four years, however, in the meantime, 
the opposition had time and opportunity to "consume" the MDF 
through its continuous attacks. Had there been four or five 
changes of government before, the MDF would not have been a 
constant target. 
  [Oszy-Toth] How did the Socialists manage to get 32 percent 
if they had not even conducted a campaign in many places? 
  [Boross] The masses were swept toward those who were most 
antagonistic to the government, with the clear hope that prices 
would decrease, pensions would increase, and it would be easier 
to make ends meet. The MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] both played up to this. It is a different matter that 
they are now slowly starting to reveal that not everything will 
be the way people believe. The next government is facing a 
difficult task because it has to live up to the wishes of the 
masses that they created and I do not think that they will be 
able to satisfy these wishes. [passage omitted] 
  [Oszy-Toth] Are you preparing for the second round, and do 
you trust that the proportions can significantly change? 
  [Boross] I am always hopeful, and not without a basis 
because public opinion on political parties is extremely 
changeable. For example, one week before the elections, public 
opinion researchers predicted 38 percent for the MSZP and much 
less for the SZDSZ. For some reason, a certain percentage of 
the votes went from the MSZP to the SZDSZ. 
  [Oszy-Toth] This is a possible conclusion. 
  [Boross] Indeed, this is only a play with logic, rather than 
an analysis. However, all along we had to fight with the 
disadvantage that Hungary is dominated by a media that does not 
appreciate our value system. [passage omitted] 
  [Oszy-Toth] In what kind of economic condition will you hand 
over the country? According to the MSZP, the country is in a 
much worse situation than it was in 1990 when they had handed 
over power. However, you claim that the country is in a better 
situation now. 
  [Boross] If an MSZP-SZDSZ coalition is made, then they will 
be saying jointly that the country is in a worse situation than 
it was in 1990, and this is the reason they are forced to take 
exigency measures that might not be to the liking of the 
population. However, for all unbiased observers, it is clear and 
evident that the country cannot be in such a bad situation 
because we completed some 60 to 70 percent of the inevitable 
changes. Four years ago, we received a country with a distorted 
ownership system, empty treasury, immeasurable tensions, and 
hidden unemployment. Those who now describe the country's 
situation as worse are actually seeking explanations for the 
measures to be brought that will be contrary to the promises 
made during the elections. [passage omitted] 
  [Oszy-Toth] MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn said many times that 
they are not sure about the country's situation and the parties 
that will form the government will possibly have some surprises. 
  [Boross] What was true in 1990 is not true now, 
nevertheless, I can hear the same statements. Let us remember 
that, in 1989, the Socialist government wanted to deny a $1.5 
billion debt, but then it admitted it. I am thinking of [former 
Prime Minister] Miklos Nemeth's memorable announcement. The 
MSZP is aware of everything, we do not have secrets, we cannot 
even have any for certain reasons of personnel. This lack of 
trust is part of the category of political games because, when 
the opposition enters government, it will excuse itself by 
saying that it had taken over the country in an even worse than 
expected situation and that is why it cannot keep its promises. 
I am convinced that the past four years will not be a reason 
and an excuse the same way as the heritage of the previous 40 
years was not accepted as an explanation from us. People who 
are voting in the hope of better living standards will sooner or 
later say that this is not what was promised. [passage omitted] 
  [Oszy-Toth] Can the MDF crumble or split? In the coming 
four years, it will have much fewer deputies in parliament. 
  [Boross] The MDF's membership acknowledged its defeat in a 
disciplined way. I hope that we will not have a split, although 
certain initiatives to upset our unity may be possible. The 
cost of this was shown by the fate of the Hungarian Justice and 
Life Party and Istvan Csurka. All in all, the MDF will have to 
renew itself, will have to assess the personnel and 
organizational issues, and it will have to become more modern 
and practical in the political struggle. In addition to this, 
the conclusion has to be drawn that the vast majority of the 
country's population was born after 1945 and became adults 
sometime after the mid-1960's. This public has a different 
attitude and does not appreciate the wounds of their 
forefathers. In spite of this, I am very happy that we 
fulfilled our moral obligation and implemented the compensation, 
even if the people who received compensation did not vote for 
us. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "One Can Count on a Calm Election </F>
Finish"] 
  [Text] The second round of the elections will be held in 
less than a week. We asked the campaign heads of the parties 
that reached the 5 percent threshold about their plans until 29 
May. 
<H5>  Balint Magyar, Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] </H5>
  From the viewpoint of the election campaign, one cannot 
count 
on any special surprise in the coming period. Compared with the 
campaign before the first round, the current campaign between 
the two rounds is calmer, more meditative, and more 
argumentative. The SZDSZ will focus on the television and radio 
debates in the last week. In addition, the party will also 
organize local talk shows. According to our experience so far, 
the people came to like this political genre because it is more 
interesting and faster paced than the usual political meetings. 
Of course, just as until now, the SZDSZ continues to advertise 
on billboards, flags, in the radio, on television, and in the 
newspapers. 
<H5>  Istvan Eszes, Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] </H5>
  We have 12 candidates still running in the second round. In 
places where we are not present, we will mainly support the 
candidates of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the 
Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]. There is no sense in 
holding national meetings; therefore, we concentrate on local 
events popularizing our still running candidates, including new 
billboards and leaflets. Some eight to 10 of our candidates 
have real chances of obtaining a parliamentary mandate. 
<H5>  Mrs. Nagy Agnes Maczo, FKGP </H5>
  Our campaign continues to be a puritan one. We are the party 
that spends the least, and we can prove this. Our 
advertisements from the first round will remain on the radio and 
television; we have no money for new ones, and we do not 
advertise in newspapers at all. Until the end of the campaign, 
we will hold at least two meetings, but generally four meetings, 
naturally, in places where our candidates are still running. 
The leading speakers at these festive meetings that attract 
large number of people are FKGP Chairman Jozsef Torgyan and 
myself. After the success of the first round, in addition to 
its own large camp of supporters, the FKGP can justifiably count 
on the votes of the members and sympathizers of the Agrarian 
Federation, with the exception of the chairmen of the 
agricultural cooperatives, as well as on the support of 
followers of the succumbed Hungarian Justice and Life Party 
[MIEP] and those who became disappointed in the MDF. Thus, we 
consider all our 47 candidates to be potential winners. 
<H5>  Karoly Herenyi [MDF] </H5>
  In the remaining days until the second round, the MDF thinks 
it is important to draw attention to the dangers of a possible 
two-thirds majority government, where the role of the opposition 
could become only formal. The MDF acknowledges the fact that 
the voters sent this party into opposition, but the second round 
will decide whether the society wants a strong opposition or 
not. The campaign is also a period of promises and occasional 
irresponsible promises as well. With four years of government 
experience behind it, the MDF knows exactly what opportunities 
the new government will have. Therefore, it is our obligation 
to draw the voters' attention to the fact that there are quite a 
few unrealistic promises among the many promises made now. We do 
not want to change our campaigning style in the remaining 
period. Instead of central events, we only regard as important 
to support our 98 individual candidates still running in the 
second round. We also want to see as many people participating 
in the second round as in the first round. 
<H5>  Imre Szekeres, Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] </H5>
  In the remaining few days, the MSZP does not want to change 
its current campaigning style. It will not deal with other 
parties and their election results; instead, the MSZP will 
concentrate on making people aware of the solutions that we 
offer in case we form a government. 
<H5>  Janos Ader, Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] </H5>
  After the withdrawals from the cooperation agreement of the 
liberal parties, there are Fidesz candidates in five individual 
electoral districts. The Fidesz supports them with local 
campaigns.

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Varga, deputy chairman of the </F>
Christian Democratic People's Party, by Karoly Banhidi; place 
and date not given: "Everyone in the KDNP Comes to the End of 
His Mandate"] 
  [Excerpts] For the coalition parties, a shocking 
socialist-liberal advance emerged after the first round of the 
elections. The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] has 
multiplied the number of its members in recent years. However, 
only 7 percent of citizens voted in favor of the KDNP, a party 
that represents Christian-national values. We asked KDNP Deputy 
Chairman Laszlo Varga about the causes of this unexpected 
failure. 
  [Banhidi] You declared repeatedly that, in the past, the 
Hungarian people never gave more than 16 percent of their votes 
to either the extreme right, the arrow-cross people, or the 
communists. In view of the results of the first round of the 
elections in which the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] received 
32 percent, what is your opinion about such an expression of the 
voters' will? 
  [Varga] Indeed, I mentioned this repeatedly during our 
campaign meetings in the capital and in the provinces. I also 
declared in front of prominent foreign guests present at the 
conference of the European Democratic Union in Budapest that 
they are now in a country where people never lost their senses 
and never gave more than 16 percent votes to either the 
arrow-cross people or the communists. And now, the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] received as many votes as the arrow-cross 
people and the communists together. I see a simple explanation 
for this, namely that, in democracy, every government has to go 
if it is unable to deal with unemployment and inflation. Of 
course, there is no rule to this, and there is no exception to 
the rule either. People see and feel politics on their own skin 
and through the increase in their own expenses. Some 20 percent 
of our 2.5 million pensioners are living on the boundary of the 
subsistence minimum, and we have an unemployment rate of almost 
500,000 people. In such a situation, these people cannot think 
further than everyday problems and subsistence. The citizens 
decided to have another government. This would take care of the 
election issue, but the situation is not that simple after all. 
No matter how many mistakes this government made, and every 
government makes mistakes, they are not the only ones that 
caused the problems; the fact that a socialist economy had to be 
turned into a market economy in the course of the change in the 
regime also had its share. The Hungarian population failed to 
consider and evaluate this. 
  [Banhidi] At least on the basis of the first round of 
elections, we can say that the socialist-liberal advance in 
Hungary is unique in Europe, and the consequences of this 
phenomenon are unpredictable.... 
  [Varga] I agree that such an advance of the left and of the 
liberal trend is a unique phenomenon on the map of Europe. 
However, we set the pillars of democracy, and I continue to 
have confidence in the common sense of the Hungarian people. I 
regard the first round of elections a little as a mistake, 
haste, and even defiance, rather than a real stand in favor of 
the MSZP ideology. At the same time, in my opinion, one should 
not be afraid of a left-wing danger because, the left that is 
regarded as left in the classic sense of the word in Europe does 
not exist in Hungary. Rather, I see a danger in the fact that 
we do not yet know which, and how many, people there are in the 
MSZP who are still there from among the old communists. 
Although transformed, this party came from the past, and it is 
difficult to forget that. 
  [Banhidi] Many people think that the socialists' victory is 
also due to the exaggerated national and Christian line and 
manifestations of the coalition.... 
  [Varga] It is possible that the national-Christian concept 
has become overused. One can overuse a slogan, but if this 
slogan has content, I think the use and depth of this slogan 
must affect the people. If we take the composition of our 
current population, people between 15 and 50 years of age make 
up 60 percent of the population. In the previous regime, these 
people grew totally disaccustomed to the national and Christian 
values or their internal content. Governments and powers come 
and go but, in a democracy, the people find out quickly whether 
the promises are really fulfilled. 
  [Banhidi] In evaluating the results of the first round, one 
can hear voices according to which a certain process of change 
has started in the KDNP and this could even lead to a change in 
the person of the party chairman. 
  [Varga] The mandate of everyone in the KDNP will come to an 
end this year. The debates are natural, and they were strong 
after the first round of the elections. 
  [Banhidi] Has any national committee member accepted 
personal responsibility? 
  [Varga] There has not been any one like that, and I did not 
hear of any calling to account. [passage omitted] 
  [Banhidi] There are people who think that those who voted in 
favor of the MSZP are confusing the concepts of settling 
accounts and revenge. The socialists have not yet announced 
their candidate for the position of prime minister, but Gyula 
Horn would accept the position if the MSZP members decided in 
favor of this.... 
  [Varga] We do not yet know whether Gyula Horn will become 
prime minister; nor do we know yet whether the MSZP will get an 
absolute majority after the second round. The key position is 
now in the hands of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. A 
lot will depend on their results. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["G.Z."-initialed interview with Major General Janos Deak, </F>
commander of the Hungarian Army; place and date not given: "The 
Reorganization of the Army Should Continue"] 
  [Text] [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What changes have taken place in 
the relations between the Army and society since the change in 
the regime? Are there any signs attesting to the fact that 
society now really regards the Hungarian Army as its own Army? 
  [Deak] We soldiers think that the relations between the Army 
and society are strengthened by numerous positive signs. This 
society did not like the Army. The foreign contacts and the 
foreign goals were well known. Many people questioned the need 
for military service. Today, the sensitivity of our society 
toward the problems facing our Army has become perceptible. The 
Army and the need for Army service are no longer issues debated 
in the civilian sphere. We must admit, however, that the 
extended Yugoslav conflict has greatly contributed to the 
strengthening of this view. The fact that only a fraction of 
the 65,000 young people conscripted annually ask for alternative 
military service shows the increased acceptance of military 
service. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The Army has not been properly financed in 
recent years. Its yearly budget was mostly set on the basis of 
the "principle of leftover" [maradekelv]. Do you see any chance 
of the new parliament recognizing the need for adequate support 
of the Army? What can you do for this? 
  [Deak] The inadequate financing of the Army started as early 
as the eighties. The budget did not make technological 
development possible; nor did it enable us to improve the 
living, working, and service circumstances, including soldiers' 
pay. In view of all this, it is understandable that we are 
happy to see that the Army received modern combat aircraft in 
exchange for the Soviet debts to Hungary, and we will be able to 
deploy a complete tactical air wing soon. We hope that the 
Russians will supply further technical equipment used by the 
Army and the border police in exchange for a part of the 
outstanding debt toward Hungary. Naturally, the soldiers are 
aware of Hungary's ability to carry burdens. However, I think 
that the budget should be drawn up in accordance with our tasks. 
The size of the Army, its composition, and its technical supply 
should be determined in accordance with its tasks. Our concepts 
regarding the future reorganization of the Army are ready. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Many people think that we are over the most 
difficult phase in the reorganization of the Army, and one 
should count on fewer conflicts than in the past years. Do you 
agree with this evaluation? 
  [Deak] I do not think that we are over the most difficult 
phase. There have been negative measures, but the period ahead 
of us will not be easier, because we must continue to reorganize 
the Army. We will submit the relevant plans to the new 
government and the new parliament. We would like to see ahead 
until the year 2010. There are numerous new elements in our 
plan. For example, we will attribute great importance to the 
rapid deployment forces. We want to strengthen both the size 
and preparedness of our staff of warrant officers. I would 
divide the existing Army into three main parts: rapid deployment 
forces, defense, and reserves. In the future, we envisage the 
introduction of a differentiated standing Army service 
coordinated with the above. At least 50 percent of the rapid 
deployment force would be made up of professional soldiers. I 
cannot envisage a shorter Army service than 12 months in these 
units and in the active defense forces. It would be 
irresponsible to make untrained soldiers carry out combat tasks. 
However, in the case of the reserves, we can envisage a 
reduction of the service. At the same time, we must modify the 
reserves, even by modifying the defense law if necessary. 
People who had served less would be called up for reserves duty 
more frequently. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The replacement and modernization of some 
military technology and weapons systems will become inevitable 
in the coming years. In view of the medium-term military 
technology development plan, where do you see possibilities of 
development first? 
  [Deak] Some 90 percent of our military technology is based 
on Soviet technology. At the moment, it seems that we have no 
other choice but to continue to purchase weapons from the East. 
We do not have the possibility of purchasing arms from the 
West. In addition, we would like to rely increasingly on the 
Hungarian industry. However, we must, anyway, purchase the most 
modern electronic systems from the West or the United States. 
Without this, we cannot fulfill the integration requirements. 
The priority is well known in this area: air defense, 
reconnaissance, radio-electronic combat, antiarmor systems. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Could the expected changes in the leadership 
of the Defense Ministry disturb the professional staff? Can you 
envisage a division in the Army similar to the one in our 
society along party lines? 
  [Deak] Any change in the defense and military leadership 
system can only occur according to the stipulations of the 
defense law. This law stipulates the management and leadership 
systems in details. No matter what changes occur in this house, 
the Army leadership system must be continuous, stable, and firm. 
The Army is above parties. We do not intend to interfere in 
government activity. We are waiting for the politician who will 
lead this ministry respectfully and be ready to cooperate. I 
think that both the minister and the leading officials will 
respect the idea of keeping a distance from politics. In my 
view, a wonderful staff of officers is currently serving in the 
Hungarian Army. I can say this not only in view of their 
professional knowledge, but also in view of their honesty, 
diligence, and readiness to accept sacrifices. I think all this 
is a guarantee that no division whatsoever will take place 
within the Hungarian Army.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Miklos Csurgay, commander of </F>
the Hungarian Air Force, by Antal Andrassy; place and date not 
given: "Poor Air Defense"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Csurgay] The technical 
equipment of our air defense, and the reconnaissance and 
interception tasks connected to this, undoubtedly cannot be said 
to be good, so in this sense, we indeed have nothing to 
celebrate. For many years there has been no money at all to 
modernize reconnaissance, interception, or armament. I cannot 
even remember when I last signed an invoice that would have 
given an opportunity for the tiniest modernization. 
  [Andrassy] And probably no one else can. 
  [Csurgay] This is true. We have seen some progress recently 
because we equipped six aircraft with friend-and-foe recognition 
systems that we developed, and we will also equip the MiG-29's 
with this. These MiG-29's that we received in exchange for the 
Russian debt were our only chance to significantly modernize our 
aircraft stock. At the same time, we have received 20 Albatross 
jet-propelled training airplanes, so we have managed to speed up 
our domestic training of pilots, which was started in 1993. We 
are planning to deploy the MiG-29 fleet from the autumn. In my 
view, this type of aircraft will more or less satisfy our needs 
until 2010. Especially if, again in exchange for the Russian 
state debt, we also received SZ-300 air defense missiles, which 
is a weapon equivalent to the famous Patriots. [passage omitted] 
  [Andrassy] We left the Warsaw Pact, so we "do not belong 
anywhere" just now. Has this impaired the effectiveness of our 
air defense? We are not receiving anything from anywhere; at 
most, we can get weapons that are sold by weight. 
  [Csurgay] We do not even get the ones sold by weight. 
Hungary is unable to buy any kind of new weaponry at the 
moment. At most we may receive something in exchange for the 
aforementioned debts. This is fortunate! As for belonging 
anywhere, my view is that, in spite of all the disadvantages, it 
is better if we prepare ourselves for a defense that is as 
efficient as possible, relying on our own resources. 
  [Andrassy] Can this create an opportunity for us to join the 
developed western world? So that we know, for example, what 
actually happened on the AWACS planes that are in service in our 
airspace due to the southern crisis? 
  [Csurgay] We are aware of the fact that they are here, we 
have constant contact with them. We certainly do not have the 
technical equipment to find out what happens on board and 
whether they participate in combat guidance. We have to make do 
with the information received from them. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Luiza Kowalska: "The Army: When Will Deputies </F>
Discuss the Army; President Delays Defense Debate?"] 
  [Text] It is not very likely that the Sejm debate on 
Poland's defense system, the first in four years, will be held 
in June. The Sejm's National Defense Committee issued a 
statement yesterday, expressing its "concern over the prolonged 
work on the document on the fundamental problems for the defense 
system." 
  It was a few months ago that Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy 
promised the leadership of the National Defense Ministry [MON] 
to hold a debate on the defense system, the first in four years. 
MON Head Piotr Kolodziejczyk hoped that during the debate the 
deputies would say exactly how much money it would be possible 
to earmark for the Army in the next few years. There are many 
indications, however, that the deputies will not hold this 
discussion before the summer holiday break. Tbe reason for this 
is the delay of a document, which the government is supposed to 
submit to the Sejm for discussion -- "On the Fundamental 
Problems of the Defense System." 
  The government is supposed to decide in this document who 
should steer the Army and what the scope of his powers should 
be. Originally the document contained two proposals: the 
president, as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, steers 
the Army through the chief of the General Staff who is 
subordinate to him; the president controls the Army through the 
defense minister, to whom, in turn, as it is today, the chief of 
the General Staff is subordinate. 
  Even though everything seems to indicate that the government 
will accept the second option, at the last moment the president 
proposed that the National Defense Committee [KOK] should be 
consulted on this issue. The president supports the first 
solution, and the composition of KOK (most of them are 
supporters of Lech Walesa) guarantees that he will gain definite 
support there. 
  However, decisions of KOK are not final for the government. 
Thus, they will not influence its final choice and the session 
of KOK will only delay the submission of the document "On the 
Fundamental Problems of the Defense System" in the Sejm. This 
will probably defer the entire debate. 
  It is not very likely that the president will manage to win 
the support of the Sejm by stalling for time. All the major 
parties in the Sejm are in favor of the solution that is in 
force today and they declare that nothing will make them change 
their opinions. "We really do care about democracy," says Jerzy 
Szmajdzinski of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], asked about 
the possibility of backing the president's option. According to 
him, SLD will not change its mind, even if it counts on 
Aleksander Kwasniewski to be elected president soon. 
  If the debate is eventually held, the deputies would like to 
define in a special resolution what issues are most important 
for the Army. Janusz Onyszkiewicz of the Union of Liberty 
suggested yesterday that the resolution include the necessity of 
maintaining the apolitical character of the Army and leaving the 
responsibility for defense affairs with the government, 
especially with the defense minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacek Pawlicki: "Eastern Barrier? Trade With </F>
Former USSR"] 
  [Text]Over the next years, Russia will keep reducing 
its imports more and more because of the burden of paying back 
interest rates on foreign credits. So a program of expansion 
based on an exchange of oil and natural gas (which are 
strategically important to us) in return for food surpluses, 
should be put aside and instead, one must seriously think over 
strategies for regaining Eastern markets. 
  Hopes expressed by left-wing politicians for rebuilding 
trade 
with Russia may come to nothing. All the signs are that Russia 
-- which is entangled in its own political and economic problems 
-- has practically no interest in expanding its trade with 
Poland. 
  It is not known whether the "breakthrough" visit by Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Chernomyrdin [as published] to Warsaw -- 
which was announced for May -- will take place in June. There is 
more and more talk of July, but that will also depend on 
Russia's internal situation which keeps changing radically daily. 
  Zbigniew Okonski, deputy foreign economic cooperation 
minister, who was subjected to a "confession" before the Sejm 
Foreign Economic Relations Commission on 25 May, admitted that 
Chernomyrdin's visit would not be a step further in resolving 
the most important issues for both sides, that is, mutual debt 
levels, and a modern system for payments in trade. 
<H5>  Mounting Discrepancies </H5>
  For now, all documents which are strategically important to 
us, are still subject to negotiation. The treaty on economic 
cooperation, which was signed in August 1993, and supposed to 
reverse the trend in mutual relations, has not even been 
ratified by Moscow. There is still no trade protocol for 1994. 
The Russians refuse to agree to use the method of barter 
applied in the past: Their natural gas in return for our food 
products. 
  There is still no agreement -- which was announced by the 
two 
prime ministers in Moscow in April -- concerning mutual supply 
of strategic merchandise in the 1994-2000 period. 
  The Russian concept of reexports does not allow for signing 
an agreement on military and technical cooperation. It is the 
same case with a protocol on mutual supplies of special 
equipment: We submitted orders for $25 million worth of 
merchandise, while the Russians are offering merchandise for 
just $4 million. 
  There is no news concerning a speedy settlement of mutual 
debts. The Polish and Russian commissions are said to be working 
on this very hard, but the issue will definitely not be resolved 
soon. 
  The Polish Finance Ministry is not eager to be hasty, 
anyway. 
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which was 
willing to financially coparticipate in reconstructing the 
system of Polish-Russian mutual payments, finally gave up since 
it was not able to find reliable partners among Russian banks. 
  Negotiations are still going on concerning the presence of 
our fishing boats in the Sea of Okhotsk. It has been agreed 
that part of them will leave, but the Russians do not feel fully 
satisfied yet. 
<H5>  Bad Memories </H5>
  Many companies seem to think that Russia will gladly 
exchange 
its natural resources for our canned meat or pickled cucumbers. 
But past experience contradicts that. The famous "natural gas 
for food" transaction, implemented in 1992, may be a warning in 
that regard. 
  In return for food and agricultural products from Poland, we 
were supposed to receive 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas, 
with a possibility of increasing supply to 2 billion. 
  Due to misunderstandings on both sides, just 0.5 billion 
cubic meters of gas (worth $44.5 million) was supplied. On our 
part, the following was shipped East: 65,500 tonnes of apples, 
93,500 tonnes of potatoes, 500 tonnes of garlic, 2,500 tonnes of 
pickled cucumbers, and 1,000 tonnes of canned food products. By 
the way, the last item mentioned did not come directly from 
Poland. 
  "There could be have been much more of the food" -- Deputy 
Minister Okonski argued. According to the Foreign Economic 
Cooperation Ministry [MWGzZ], the "natural gas for food" 
contract backfired because the Russians wanted to receive 
foreign-made merchandise in addition to Polish products, but 
"they were not treated with understanding." 
<H5>  Hope About Credits </H5>
  Both MWGzZ and exporters have high hopes about a draft law 
which was just approved by the government, concerning insurance 
on export contracts. This year, the government intends to spend 
25 trillion zlotys (about $1 billion) on the guarantees, but it 
is not known whether -- due to quite a high risk factor -- 
Russia will be on the list of countries to which exports will be 
insured by the Corporation for Export Credit Insurance [KUKE]. 
  Fortunately, there is still Belarus, the Baltic countries, 
and the Asian post-Soviet republics. For example, an agreement 
has already been initialled in the Finance Ministry concerning a 
$30 million credit for exports of our merchandise to Kazakhstan. 
  Poland will definitely not be able to tie up substantial 
means in credits and insuring trade with the East. Germany 
could afford to "sink" 18 billion German Marks in Russia (this 
is how much unpaid bills are worth -- GAZETA WYBORCZA's note). 
Our KUKE will never be the German Hermes whose Russian 
liabilities reach 5 billion German Marks.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer] "Yeltsin Spills the Beans on Lech 
Walesa" is the title given by the weekly NIE to an article on 
Boris Yeltsin's recent book: Notes by the President. The 
Russian leader writes that during last year's visit to Warsaw, 
he handed to the Polish side a file containing the entire 
Solidarity dossier. I asked our Moscow correspondent Andrzej 
Siezieniewski if he knew Yeltsin's book. 
  [Begin recording] [Siezieniewski] Yes, I have read through 
it. The excerpt you want to ask me about is indeed in the book, 
on page 180, in the chapter: Russia and the world, sub-heading: 
Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel. It reads as follows: It is 
well-known that the KGB tried to oversee the destruction of the 
Solidarity trade union. I brought Lech Walesa--Boris Yeltsin 
writes--a copy of the documents of the Suslov Commission, the 
shadow leader of the Brezhnev Politburo. It was a whole dossier 
on Solidarity. Polish and Soviet KGB men analyzed in detail the 
whole truth about the leaders of the workers' movement. 
Sometimes it was terrible to read these documents, Boris 
Yeltsin says, because the KGB x-ray was so ruthless. I slapped 
the file with my hand and said: It is all here, take it. Walesa 
turned slightly pale--Boris Yeltsin recalls the moment he handed 
the Polish president the documents he had brought with him on 
his visit to Warsaw last August. 
  [Announcer] Have the Russia media given any information at 
all about what was in the documents President Yeltsin brought to 
Warsaw? 
  [Siezieniewski] No, there was nothing known about that. In 
any case, Boris Yeltsin did not give details about what was in 
the diplomatic luggage he took to Warsaw. It is certainly 
well-known that Boris Yeltsin had access to the KGB archives, 
and if he says that what he took with him and what he handed 
over to the Polish side contained, among other things, the 
dossier on Solidarity, then we can most probably believe 
him--although Boris Yeltsin is a politician, and one does not 
always play fair here, what is said does not always correspond 
100 percent to the truth. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] I also telephoned Boris Yeltsin's adviser, Yuriy 
Leonov. 
  [Begin Leonov recording] Some sort of documents were handed 
over to President Walesa, but I do not know their exact content. 
In my opinion, insofar as they were handed over to the Polish 
side, only the Polish side can make the decision to publish the 
documents. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] I asked Minister Andrzej Zakrzewski of President 
Lech Walesa's Chancellery. 
  [Begin Zakrzewski recording] I have never entered into 
polemics with the NIE weekly and I will not do so, because I am 
one of those people who regard Jerzy Urban's weekly as 
journalistic folklore, although again I am not one of those 
people who underestimate that weekly's influence. However, 
regarding the substance of what you asked about, I know nothing 
of the file mentioned by your Moscow correspondent. I have 
Yeltsin's memoirs, I received them yesterday, but I have not 
read them yet--and the competent people, the only people who 
could give binding information, are abroad for the next four 
days, for they are in Switzerland. I have not the faintest idea 
about any file from the most secret Kremlin safe concerning the 
KGB's detailed study of the Solidarity leaders. I have not set 
eyes on it, and I doubt whether... [pauses] Well, maybe it does 
exist, but in any case I know nothing about it. [end recording]

  [Text] Recent Solidarity strikes in hard coal collieries 
ended in complete disaster and humiliation for the organizers 
and the strike became a way of playing politics by Solidarity 
leaders at the expense of miners. Such is the opinion of a 
mining team of the August-80 Free Trade Union in Katowice. 
  For the first time the government coerced the strikers' 
representatives to accept the fact that strikers would not be 
paid for the period of the strike. In the team's opinion 
Solidarity leaders promised the strikers that they would be paid 
for the period of the strike. Currently, however, they are 
avoiding responsibility for the effects of the protest.

  [Text] Warsaw, 25 May -- Last year's initiative to relay 
TVPolonia satellite programs to the United States has ended in a 
fiasco, TVPolonia director Leszek Wasiuta, said today at a 
meeting of the Sejm Commission for Liaison With Poles Abroad and 
the Senate Commission for Immigration and Poles Abroad. 
  "We at TVPolonia are all taking the fact that we could not 
start relays in the United States as a personal failure. It is 
not because of the lack of goodwill from the Polish side; we 
failed because our American partner could not bear the burden," 
Wasiuta explained. An agreement with him was signed last year 
during the chairmanship of Janusz Zaorski of what was then state 
radio and television. The board of the Polish Television 
Company will have to decide whether to continue this initiative. 
  Wasiuta added that the issue now is "whether we should be 
looking for a partner by means of a Wall Street marketing bureau 
for between $5,000 and $15,000 a month and sign an agreement 
within three months, or whether we should apply the same method, 
that is, to get in touch with a Pole who does not give any 
guarantees but has goodwill." He said that TVPolonia 
management's option is to employ a professional company, which 
would look for a partner and check if "he has the money and 
power to sell the television." The acceptance of that option 
depends, however, on the board of the Polish Television Company. 
  In Wasiuta's opinion the relay of the program itself to 
America poses no problem. The issue is whether Polish Americans 
want to tune in to TVPolonia. "Production is a third of the 
success that depends upon the ability to sell the product," he 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by "sad": "Budget Deficit '94"] </F>
  [Text]According to the Finance Ministry's public debt 
department, this year's budget deficit will most probably be in 
the range of 70 to 75 trillion zlotys, and not 83 trillion as 
the Budget Law states. 
  The budget was designed on the assumption that interest 
rates 
on the National Bank of Poland's [NBP] refinancing credit will 
be 28 percent on the average. 
  "We know already at this point that it is not going to be 
the 
case," Piotr Dziewulski, director of the Finance Ministry's 
department of public debt, told journalists yesterday. A higher 
refinancing rate means that the cost of servicing the debt 
(meaning repayment of interest rates on bonds and discounts on 
Treasury bonds) will increase the budget. 
  On the other hand, the Budget Law clearly limits the cost of 
servicing the debt -- it cannot exceed 73.8 trillion zlotys. So 
if budget revenue does not rise fast enough to be able to 
finance the higher costs of servicing the debt, then the budget 
deficit will have to be lower than was assumed up to now. 
Otherwise, the cost of servicing the debt would have to go over 
the 73.8 trillion-zloty mark, but that would require an earlier 
amendment of the Budget Law. 
  According to Director Dziewulski, instead of the 83 trillion 
zlotys planned in the Budget Law, the actual deficit may be 
between 70 and 75 trillion zlotys. 
  "I think that the average interest rate on NBP's refinancing 
credit will be 33 percent in 1994. I am assuming optimistically 
that NBP will conduct another reduction at the end of the year," 
Director Dziewulski added. 
  As of 18 May, 37.5 percent of the maximum allowed amount of 
the debt (73.8 trillion zlotys) was devoted from the budget for 
servicing the debt, whereas by the same date, budget revenue 
constituted 33.3 percent of the planned amounts for the entire 
year (for budget expenditures, the figure was 31.6 percent).

<F P=106> [Article by "P.S.": "Healthy Competition; Are Polish Banks </F>
Afraid of Foreign Competitors?"] 
  [Text]Foreign banks do not constitute a major threat 
to Polish financial institutions -- said Marian Krzak, chairman 
of the Association of Polish Banks during a meeting at NOWA 
EUROPA in April. "I do not believe that the foreign banks could 
enter Poland all of a sudden and comprehensively." Chairman 
Krzak thinks that their entry into our market is unavoidable, 
while their presence here may be an opportunity as it would 
force others to compete with them. What do representatives of 
Polish banks think of that competition? Are they afraid of 
it? 
  I am not afraid of healthy competition -- it can only change 
the market in a positive way -- Wojciech Haase, deputy chairman 
of Bank Gdanski SA told NOWA EUROPA. But unfortunately, we have 
seen some negative phenomena recently: Some of the foreign banks 
active in Poland began applying dumping prices, which may have a 
bad impact on the market. For instance, use is being made of 
calculating mandatory reserves according to the status on the 
last day of a month. But sooner or later, fundamental 
principles of competition will be defined. Just like foreign 
banks, Bank Gdanski is trying to act according to international 
standards, mainly in the area of treasury operations. A code of 
principles to be applied on the money and foreign currency 
market, should ensure a fair play type of competition. 
  Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank in Lublin was established as an 
American bank. We are not particularly afraid of competition -- 
said Barbara Rudzinska, the bank's press spokesman. Three years 
ago, we were high above the level of our Polish competitors even 
when it comes to architectural design. Our clerks were also of 
high quality and we tried to implant similar notions throughout 
our domestic branches. All these innovations successfully met 
the test of practice -- our customers got to like us and other 
Lublin banks followed in our footsteps. We became a carrier of 
foreign competition ourselves. Of course, what is on the 
outside is not everything. A program of bringing the bank back 
to health -- which has been applied intensively -- contains many 
new elements which increase our competitiveness toward both 
domestic and foreign banks. 
  Competition from foreign banks is an issue of the future 
broadly speaking. So banks have time to get ready for it. That 
will occur as the system's consolidation continues -- in which 
Kredyt Bank actively participates: Some examples are Bank 
Ziemski, Bank Regionalny in Rybnik, and there may be another 
similar move in the near future -- says Tomasz Uchman, Kredyt 
Bank's press spokesman. Facing up to the competition also 
entails a need to strengthen capital. Our bank can be an 
example to follow also in that regard. The issue of shares was 
carried out successfully, the bank's credibility will now be 
confirmed and publicly verified through the stock market. 
Thanks to the operation, our own financial means increased to 
over 1 trillion zlotys, which is high for Poland. It is also 
worth mentioning that Kredyt Bank has established reserves for 
lost credits in the amount required by the National Bank of 
Poland [NBP] as early as at the end of last year, that is, 
before the issue prospectus was published. True, it caused a 
drop in our results -- with net profit amounting to just 19 
billion zlotys -- but the reserves at the level of 230 billion 
zlotys increase our credibility. This year, reaching the 
planned profit of 100 billion zlotys, seems realistic. In our 
activity, we try to make other indicators -- those of solvency, 
security, or the level of bad debts -- comply with NBP's 
requirements and regulations of the European Union [EU]. Once 
Poland becomes EU's member, only strong, secure, and efficient 
banks will be able to meet the challenge of competition. 
  Professor Andrzej Olszewski, deputy chairman of Prosper Bank 
SA, is probably the only pessimist among bankers: Foreign banks 
have greater capital at their disposal -- which they can direct 
toward profitable activities -- and that is competition. Polish 
banks can finance ventures using share capital and their own 
assets, while foreign banks have the possibility to earn bigger 
money. As far as the competitiveness of services is concerned, 
foreign banks are not particularly interested in deposits by 
individuals, but in financing merchandise and investment 
turnover. They have sufficient capital for that, while Polish 
banks have to receive deposits from the population in order to 
accumulate such capital levels. The population in turn is 
looking for security that foreign banks and those banks that 
have NBP's guarantees, are more likely to provide, not -- as a 
general rule -- privately-owned banks.

<F P=106> [Article by Konrad Sadurski: "NBP's Mandatory Empire"] </F>
  [Text]The National Bank of Poland [NBP] has invested 
over 4 trillion zlotys in savings banks that almost went 
bankrupt. That amount was enough to enable NBP to take control 
of several privately-owned banks, which is the reason 
shareholders in those banks are suing NBP, and why some 
politicians are critical of the central bank. 
  So far, NBP has invested over 1.650 trillion zlotys in 
savings in the Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank in Lublin. Then, NBP 
supported the bank with an additional 150 billion zlotys, to 
enable it to take over the Poznan-based Merkury bank. 
  Saving the Lodzki Bank Rozwoju cost NBP at least 1.152 
trillion zlotys, for Prosper Bank the figure was 950 billion, 
and for Interbank -- about 130 billion zlotys. NBP also 
provided financial assistance to Warsaw-based Gecobank for its 
takeover of Baltic Bank. 
<H5>  Anti-Bankruptcy Nationalization </H5>
  "Instead of privatization of the banking sector, we are 
dealing with the repeated nationalization of some banks, 
conducted by NBP. In addition, these NBP expenditures are 
outside the control of parliament and the government," 
politicians say. Some of them also stress that this way, NBP is 
spending taxpayers' money. But NBP refutes the accusations by 
saying that the money for saving the banks comes from issuing 
additional money. 
  Politicians also hold it against NBP for having persisted so 
vigorously in its position that the money supply should not 
exceed 150 trillion zlotys this year; NBP also refused to lend 
more than 35 trillion zlotys to finance the budget deficit, and 
given all that, it still decided to devote about 3 trillion 
zlotys to save banks without much hesitation. 
  "Will this not cause an over-the-plan price increase?" 
politicians ask. NBP says definitely not, because it had taken 
the amount into account while planning on inflation levels. It 
explains that making an application for declaring bankruptcy by 
a large bank, could lead to a classic run on banks which would 
cause a domino effect and bankruptcies by more banks. /The 
first symptoms of a run on banks could be observed after the 
submission of an application for bankruptcy by Interbank and 
Baltic Bank,/ NBP reminds. It hopes that by taking over 
financially "sick" banks, it will succeed in protecting the 
entire system from customer panic. 
  NBP assures that after bringing a bank back to health, it 
will sell its shares, maybe even through the stock market. It 
admits that the process of bringing a bank to health may last a 
few years, but -- according to NBP's expectations -- perhaps 
someone will agree to invest in a bank which currently brings no 
profit but will in the future. 
<H5>  Clouds Over Empire </H5>
  NBP's measures are supported by the Association of Polish 
Banks of which almost all the country's banks are members. The 
association admits that it has itself tried to convince the 
central bank to financially support Interbank, and also to 
facilitate Gecobank's takeover of Baltic Bank. But some bankers 
are amazed at the fact that NBP -- as the supervisor of the 
banking sector -- also controls those banks in which it is a 
shareholder itself. "Regardless of the factual circumstances, 
this casts a shadow over supervisory activities," bankers say, 
and they suggest that supervision over banks be taken out of 
NBP's structures. 
  Also shareholders of the banks which are taken over, are 
critical of NBP. They do not like that NBP devotes almost the 
whole share capital of a bank which is subject to takeover, to 
cover the bank's losses. Despite the fact that -- as NBP 
assures -- such utilization of share capital is in accordance 
with the Code of Commerce, shareholders of the Lodzki Bank 
Rozwoju and of Lublin- based Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank, have 
filed a law suit against NBP. 
  NBP assures that takeovers of banks facilitate the regaining 
of credits. In both cases of the mentioned banks, about 100 
billion zlotys each were regained from shareholders and the 
management so far.

  [Excerpts] International political and financial support to 
Croatia depends to a considerable extent on the implementation 
of the Washington agreement, Mate Granic, deputy prime minister 
and foreign minister, said today in the Parliament's House of 
Counties, where he presented his report on current Croatian 
foreign policy issues. [passage omitted] 
  Among other things, he stressed that extensive diplomatic 
activities were under way to simultaneously resolve the crisis 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and reintegrate the UN protected areas 
into the Croatian legal system and to ensure that the sanctions 
against Serbia are linked to the progress in the talks on the UN 
pretected areas. He described the Vienna talks on the 
implementation of the Washington agreement as extremely 
important. He also mentioned, as he put it, good relations 
between Croatia and its neighboring European countries, and in 
particular with the United States, and went on to stress that 
the international political and financial support to Croatia 
depended to a considerable extent on the implementation of the 
Washington agreement. He said that the attempt to destabilize 
the Croatian parliament had somewhat affected Croatia's 
international position. 
  [Begin Granic recording] Foreign countries would certainly 
welcome a negotiated solution. The deepening of the crisis will 
certainly not benefit anyone and will be to the detriment of the 
Republic of Croatia. [end recording] 
  During the question time, Mate Granic said Croatia would 
definitely not extend the UN Protection Force's mandate unless 
it deployed its forces on Croatian borders with Serbia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to prevent armed provocations and ethnic 
cleansing. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [Unidentified correspondent] A Croatian Assembly 
House of Counties session was addressed today by Mate Granic, 
Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, who 
delivered a report on current Croatian foreign policy issues. 
In his address he stressed that Croatia had good relations with 
almost all neighboring and European countries. Official Italy 
has contributed to this, he said, by denying worrying statements 
made by Italian neofascists regarding Croatia's territorial 
integrity. 
  For Croatian diplomacy, the most important task at the 
moment 
is to achieve the simultaneous resolution of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the reintegration of UN Protected Areas 
into the legal system of Croatia, while the sanctions against 
Serbia ought to be linked with the progress reached in 
negotiations on UN Protected Areas. He warned that the UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Force] mandate will not be extended if its troops 
are not deployed along Croatia's borders with Serbia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and unless it prevents ethnic cleansing. 
  Minister Granic assessed the Vienna agreement on the 
implementation of the Washington Agreement as being extremely 
important for Croatia and stressed: 
  [Begin Granic recording] The Zagreb cease-fire agreement is 
supported by all countries and by international financial 
institutions. We must carry out our diplomatic activities 
carefully, and gain support from international factors for all 
activities that we will be undertaking in connection with 
UNPROFOR. But the key issue is how the Washington Agreement is 
going to be implemented. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] In continuation, the Chamber of Counties 
rejected a demand by the opposition parties for a no-confidence 
motion in the culture and education and defense ministers to be 
put on the vote, but demanded a report on the set-up of the 
Croatian Army and results of an investigation into the explosion 
at the Duboki Jarak munitions dump. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Knin, May 25 (TANJUG) -- The government of the 
republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) remains by its stand that 
negotiations with Croatia should be held in Geneva, because this 
secures the R.S.K.'s equality in the negotiations, R.S.K. 
foreign minister Milan Babic has told TANJUG. 
  "By conditioning the venue for the negotiations, Croatia is 
trying to impose a political approach which does not comply 
either with the principles which we have advocated, or with the 
building up of mutual confidence founded on interest," Babic 
said on Wednesday, after an R.S.K. government session. He 
expressed regret that the deputy co-chairmen of the conference 
on former Yugoslavia had not yet found a compromise solution for 
overcoming this problem, but were holding out solely for 
proposals by the Croatian side. 
  The key to the final resolving of relations with Croatia is 
in the recognition of the R.S.K. by the international community 
and in the signing of a peace accord with Croatia on that basis, 
Babic said.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Vukic: "`Rights of the Serbs Are Still </F>
Being Denied,' Says Djukic"] 
  [Text] Zagreb -- The Serbs are second-class citizens in 
Croatia, their position is similar to that of black people in 
the Republic of South Africa during apartheid or of the Indians 
in the United States. Those were the words of Milan Djukic, 
president of the SNS [Serbian National Party], describing the 
position of members of Serb national community at a press 
conference on Tuesday. 
  As usual, he substantiated his words by many concrete 
examples: The Serbs are still being evicted from their 
apartments, they are being denied their rights deriving from 
labor relations (under the guise of "rationalizing state 
offices"), their houses are still being blown up, courts do not 
provide adequate legal protection. Furthermore, Djukic says that 
perpetrators of the crime in Pakrac, Pakracka Poljana, and 
Gospic have still not been punished: "People who did not take 
part in fighting were taken away from their homes and killed in 
cold blood," those responsible for blowing up the Museum of the 
Orthodox Church in Nova Gradiska "situated right next to the 
police station" have not been found either. As to the "Zec 
case" -- "why has the president of the Republic not reacted 
before..." -- the authorities tolerate newspapers (Vinkovac 
HRVATSKI VJESNIK) that arouse national hatred and openly call 
for lynchings. It is not only common workers and members of the 
middle class that have problems at work, top internationally 
recognized experts encounter them as well: at the Sisters of 
Mercy hospital, applications were invited for the position of 
the head of the Diagnostics Department and its founder, who is a 
professor at the School of Medicine with all the necessary 
qualifications, applied. His only fault was that "he chose the 
wrong parents for himself." "His application was rejected and 
another vacancy was opened, suitable for another, "suitable" 
person, who got the position," said Djukic. 
  "The nonfunctioning of the rule-of-law state, in addition to 
the constant defamation of the Croatian Serbs in the media 
(Djukic also mentioned the "Rovinj case"), does not contribute 
to finding peaceful solutions and to the reintegration of the 
UNPA [United Nations Protected Area] zones into the Croatian 
legal system," SNS members say. They brief the government and 
the president of the Republic on their problems and Milan Djukic 
says that they "sometimes do something about it, especially when 
a particular minister can do that himself, but the problem lies 
in the malfunctioning of the rule-of-law state and in the 
discriminatory actions of civil servants, especially of those at 
lower levels. 
  Djukic also said that requesting the Serbs in Croatia to 
swear the so-called allegiance is another "act of 
discrimination." "Why are only some Croatian citizens asked to 
do that," wonders Djukic reminding of the activity of his party 
and especially of his petition "For Peaceful Coexistence in a 
Democratic and Sovereign Republic of Croatia," which was signed 
by more than 13,000 Serb citizens in August 1991. "We will not 
react to provocation, but we will demand a comprehensive 
parliamentary discussion about the position of the Serbs in 
Croatia and try to reach solutions that will be acceptable to 
everyone," said Djukic.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 25 (TANJUG) -- The Foreign Ministry of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) on Wednesday 
expressed its embitterment over Cairo's conduct and assessed 
Egypt's accusations that the F.R.Y. is accountable for the war 
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina as 
"senseless and irresponsible". Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa on Tuesday said Egypt would not invite the F.R.Y. to take 
part in a conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to be 
held in Cairo from May 31 to June 3, stating without any 
arguments a series of shocking accusations about the F.R.Y.'s 
alleged involvement in the civil war in neighbouring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "The Egyptian foreign minister's statement is unacceptable 
and does not comply with the actual state of affairs," officials 
of the F.R.Y. Foreign Ministry told TANJUG. "His explanation 
and arguments have been long surmounted, not only by reality and 
truth which is pushing its way despite the media campaign 
against the F.R.Y., but also by the events such as a ministerial 
meeting of Russia, the European Union and the U.S. on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in Geneva on May 13," the same sources said. 
  The F.R.Y. Foreign Ministry set out that it interpreted 
Egypt's decision as a gross violation of the agreement on the 
F.R.Y.'s participation in the NAM meetings when crisis in the 
former Yugoslavia is discussed and as a misuse of the role of 
the host at the NAM ministerial meetings. 
  "We interpret that decision as a wish to have the NAM openly 
sided with the Moslems in the civil war in Bosnia," it was said 
in the F.R.Y. Foreign Ministry. After the NAM summit in 
Jakarta, a so called gentlemen's agreement was drawn up under 
which the F.R.Y. has a full right to actively participate in the 
NAM meetings, at which either the crisis in the former 
Yugoslavia or other topics are being discussed. 
  Egypt defaulted regarding the New York agreement and acted 
in 
an ungentlemanlike way. An obvious intention is to exclude the 
F.R.Y. from the NAM, but this would require a full consensus. 
The Islamic bloc in the NAM is trying to persuade, first of all 
the non-aligned countries of the black Africa to join the bloc 
of the "friends" of the Bosnian Moslems.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, May 25 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister 
Radoje Kontic said on Wednesday [25 May] that the further 
maintenance of the U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia was not 
conducive to a peaceful settlement of the crisis in the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia, because they encouraged the 
Bosnian Moslems to continue waging a war. According to 
international law, the introduction of the sanctions was 
illegitimate and contrary to the humanitarian law, discrediting 
the United Nations, Radoje Kontic told domestic and foreign 
journalists from 22 countries, who participated in the 
international conference on a new world order and mass 
communications in Budva, Montenegro, from May 20-22. 
  Ever increasing announcements on unilateral lifting of the 
U.N. sanctions by Yugoslavia's neighbouring countries and 
traditional economic partners, which suffer great 
blockade-induced losses, also discredit the world organization, 
Kontic said. The United Nations in May 1992 imposed 
comprehensive sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) 
for its alleged involvement in the civil war in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BIH). Kontic said that 
Yugoslav government accepted and appreciated every peace 
initiative which equally treated all three sides in the civil 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and those settlements which respected 
interests of all the three warring peoples. 
  Efforts towards achieving a permanent ceasefire and signing 
a 
peace agreement would have to include lifting or, at least, 
easing the sanctions against Yugoslavia, because this is also 
part of the peace process, Kontic said. Kontic conveyed 
Yugoslavia's stand towards a political settlement of crisis in 
relations between Croatia and the Republic of Serb Krajina 
(R.S.K.), which envisages a cessation of hostilities, gradual 
strengthening of broken economic and other ties between the 
warring sides, and, in the end, a political settlement of their 
mutual relations. 
  The Croatian side, due to a split within Croatia's ruling 
party and its other internal problems, has lately showed signs 
of impatience and nervousness, Kontic said and warned about 
unacceptable setting of conditions and prejudiced peace 
settlements imposed by Croatia. Speaking about the Yugoslav 
programme of economic revival of the country, Kontic assessed it 
to be in many aspects unique in the world, because it is the 
first time that the economy is being reinvigorated under the 
conditions of rigid sanctions and in isolation from favourable 
affects by the world market. 
  The Yugoslav Federation, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, 
is 
for the open market economy. Yugoslavia will pursue an 
independent foreign policy in the next period and will link it 
neither to NATO, nor to any other military alliance, Kontic 
answered a journalist's question. In explaining the status of 
Yugoslavia in the Nonaligned Movement, Kontic said that 
Yugoslavia was still a member of the movement and that it had so 
far been invited to all meetings. He stressed that after 
Indonesia had begun to chair the movement, Yugoslavia was not 
invited to the ministerial conference being held in Cairo. 
  Indonesia has openly sided with the Bosnian Moslems and 
against the Serbs in the civil war in Bosnia. The Egyptian 
foreign minister in Cairo tried to accuse Yugoslavia of being 
involved in the Bosnian conflict and to expel it from the 
movement which was cofounded by Yugoslavia.

announced. 
  The two officials also discussed the effects of the 
international sanctions on the living conditions and health of 
the Yugoslavs and the problems in ferrying humanitarian aid via 
Hungary. Vincze said that Hungary, as a member of the United 
Nations, is obliged to honour its decisions, but is doing 
everything possible to facilitate the transport of relief aid to 
Yugoslavia. He said that last year 12,000 trucks carrying 
humanitarian aid had passed through Hungary, and that there had 
been problems only in four-five cases due to a lack of adequate 
documentation.

    [Editorial Report] A leading Belgrade economic weekly has 
predicted that it will be difficult for the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (FRY) to sustain the record level of energy 
production reached in the past two years. An article in the 11 
April issue of EKONOMSKA POLITIKA said that the "achievements" 
of the past two years will be difficult to repeat even though 
the FRY has assigned the highest priority to energy production. 
<H5>  Assessments of 1993 </H5>
  Maintaining such a high level would be a very tall order for 
the economically impoverished energy producers, which incurred 
huge losses in 1993 as a result of inflation and the 
government's price policy, EKONOMSKA POLITIKA analysts reported 
in the journal's 25 April issue. Oil companies lost tens of 
billions of dinars, with the exception of Beopetrol, formerly a 
branch of the Croatian oil company INA, which, besides earning 
243 billion dinars from the sale of oil derivatives, made a 
profit of 2.6 trillion dinars from financial transactions in 
1993. 
  Analyzing the performance of the Serbian electric power 
industry, EKONOMSKA POLITIKA assessed 1993 as "the most 
difficult period" for the Republic's power companies "since 
electricity first arrived in Serbia," with losses amounting to 
884 million German marks (DM). When domestic and foreign debt, 
depreciation, "and so on" are added, the losses approach DM2 
billion. EKONOMSKA POLITIKA blamed the government policy of low 
energy prices for this "dismal" result, explaining that "sales 
contributed only 1.56 percent of total revenue, with everything 
else coming from the consumption of raw materials and capital." 
Therefore, the weekly maintained, companies lacked funds for 
spare parts and maintenance, resulting in frequent malfunctions, 
outages, reduced productivity, and safety violations. 
Electricity production, for example, declined from a record 
high 37 billion kwh in 1989 to 30 billion kwh last year. It 
should be noted, said the weekly, that during this period the 
structure of consumption changed, with industrial usage 
declining 48 percent while household use rose by almost 50 
percent. 
<H5>  Seasonal Demand </H5>
  Another problem mentioned by EKONOMSKA POLITIKA was the 
seasonal fluctuation in energy demand, which ranges from an 
average daily consumption of 60 million kwh during the warmer 
months to a surge of 130 million kwh in the peak winter season 
when electricity, as the cheapest source of energy, is used for 
heating. At present price levels, the electric industry will 
experience additional losses and be unable to "repeat the 
success of the last year" in satisfying high consumer demand. 
While the government works on a new, more rational pricing 
structure and the reorganization of the energy sector, EKONOMSKA 
POLITIKA warns, a "crisis" looms. 
<H5>  Diesel Fuel Shortage </H5>
  A shortage of D-2 diesel fuel has already affected spring 
sowing, reported the same issue of EKONOMSKA POLITIKA, citing 
figures from a study conducted by the Yugoslav Chamber of 
Commerce. According to the study, the agricultural sector needs 
105,000 tons of fuel for the March to June period -- 25,400 tons 
of that total in March and 40,000 tons in April. In March, 
however, domestic oil producers delivered only 5,400 tons. 
Between 1 January and 21 March, the government imported 13,000 
tons of the fuel. Taking into account existing fuel reserves 
estimated to amount to 15,000 tons, EKONOMSKA POLITIKA concluded 
that the agriculture sector is short 71,600 tons of D-2 diesel 
fuel for the first half of 1994, with only 32 percent of its 
requirements covered. Therefore, the sector will have to receive 
increased allocations from domestic suppliers and from imports. 
<H5>  Fuel Supplies </H5>
  The same issue of EKONOMSKA POLITIKA dismissed reports that 
Serbian firms were testing so-called "eko-mer," a new, 
environmentally friendly fuel "made from domestic agricultural 
raw materials employing domestic technology," as "nice 
news...which unfortunately will not solve our problem." It also 
reported that the Pancevo oil refinery and the Belgrade firm 
Jugopetrol had decided to stop producing and selling 98-octane 
premium gasoline because they cannot import the additives needed 
to produce it. Beginning 11 April, the refinery was to produce 
only 95-octane gasoline containing 0.4 percent lead. 
<H5>  Serbia-Montenegro Discord </H5>
  The shortage of oil has had an impact on relations between 
Serbia and Montenegro, according to the 29 April issue of the 
Belgrade daily POLITIKA. Montenegro is demanding that oil 
produced in Serbia be sold not only in Serbia but also in 
Montenegro, which is otherwise entirely dependent on imports. 
POLITIKA reported that Montenegro needs 300 tons of gasoline 
and 1,800 tons of diesel fuel per month to satisfy the demands 
of its priority consumers: hospitals, schools, health centers, 
the police, and farmers. The Federal Crisis Center has proposed 
that Montenegro receive 6 to 7 percent of the total oil supply 
-- too much, judging by Serbian reactions, and too little, 
according to Montenegrin demands, the paper reported. 
  POLITIKA believes, however, that Serbian and Montenegrin 
leaders will conclude an agreement and that Montenegro will be 
receiving Serbian oil derivatives by June. In return, the paper 
noted, Montenegro will be expected to invest some of its tourism 
income in oil production in Serbia's Vojvodina Province, because 
Montenegro cannot "seriously make claims on the federation and 
at the same time ignore its obligations to the federation." 
POLITIKA contrasted the discord over the oil supply to the 
"exemplary" cooperation between the Serbian and Montenegrin 
electric power companies, which function as an integrated 
electric-energy system.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of an item appearing in the 2 May issue of </F>
TEMELJI USPEHA] 
  On 21 April, 1994, a round table was held in Belgrade. The 
topic was "The Building Materials Industry: Foundations of 
Success". The gathering was organised by Ekonomska Politika and 
the Kondor Holding Company of Belgrade. It was attended by some 
15 directors of the most renowned firms in that field, as well 
as representatives of the Federal, Republic of Serbia and City 
of Belgrade administrations. 
  Two reasons determined the title of the round table. First, 
participating in it were only good firms, i.e. those which not 
only survived in times of trial in spite of the blockade, but 
succeeded in achieving more or less good business results. The 
second, possibly more important reason, was to some extent 
symbolic. Namely, the building materials industry has been among 
industries which have their own raw materials base, depend on 
imports of energy only, i.e. crude oil and natural gas. That 
means that after the lifting of sanctions imposed by the United 
Nations they could become one of the foundations of, and give 
momentum to economic recovery of the country. Therefore, the 
voice of businessmen from that industry appears to be relevant 
in considering both present economic conditions and those which 
will occur when Yugoslavia reenters into the international 
community. 
  The first participant in the discussion, Mr. Jovan 
Bogicevic, 
assistant federal minister of the construction industry, in 
charge of that industry, spoke exactly in that sense. Mr. 
Bogicevic pointed out the great significance of that industry in 
our country. Its share of the social product before the economic 
crisis, i.e. 1981, amounted to some 11 per cent, which is 
characteristic of developed countries, although Yugoslavia does 
not belong among them, while the construction industry's share 
in developing countries amounts to 5-6 per cent. Unfortunately, 
Mr. Bogicevic stressed, that share started falling after 1981. 
so that it amounts to some 5 per cent now. 
  Overcapacity has been a special problem. Most facilities had 
been built having in mind the market of the former Yugoslavia. 
In view of their capacity even that market had been too small. 
Today, when Yugoslavia has been halved, that overcapacity is 
even more visible. However, another circumstance prevents that 
disproportion to fully tell. Shortages of natural gas and heavy 
heating oil result in underutilization of those capacities so 
that some products have been in short supply on the market. That 
refers in the first place to cement, which for that reason has 
been more expensive in Yugoslavia than in many other countries, 
including some neighboring ones. 
  Brick, roofing tile, ceramic tile and similar products 
manufacturing are in a rather different position although they 
also have been working only a few months a year due to energy 
shortages. Their problem has been the lack of demand so that 
they have large stocks of products. Economic recession caused 
the fall of investment activities, especially of private housing 
construction that used to absorb some 80 per cent of their 
output, so that those factories practically remained without 
their market. Because of that several participants in the 
discussion warned that in such a case the orientation to 
stimulating demand was better than stimulating production, as, 
e.g. giving credits to individuals who would build houses would 
almost automatically stimulate production as well. 
  Mr. Karolj Kasas, director of the firm Potisje in Kanjiza, 
spoke in particular of the significance of a stable dinar, as a 
stable currency enabled long term thinking and planning. 
"However, Mr. Kasas emphasized, a stable dinar will be useful in 
the best meaning of the word if manufacturers will be able to 
get credits for new programs, for the reconstruction of 
production lines and construction of new facilities". 
[quotation marks as published] 
  Mr. Sreten Ilic, director of the firm Vunizol of Surdulica, 
which manufactures thermoinsulating materials, pointed in 
particular to a, in his opinion, paradox. On the one hand it has 
been mentioned that the easiest way of reviving the economy was 
through the construction industry as many other industries were 
linked to it. On the other hand when concrete talks are 
initiated, the answer is that there is no money. Mr. Ilic 
therefore requested the federal and Serbian governments to 
precisely say what they have in mind doing, to say whether they 
have investment programs, whether those are public works or 
something else. 
  Directors participating in the round table however did not 
blame external sanctions and blockades as the essential limiting 
factor of development. In fact, much more was said about 
internal obstacles in the form of excise duties, personal income 
taxes, etc. The unanimous judgment was that such high taxes 
could not be easily borne even by a much stronger economy, 
situated in better economic and political conditions. 
  Prices of construction materials industry products and their 
sales have been heavily burdened by transport costs. A very 
illustrative example in that respect was presented by Mr. 
Tomislav Vasovic (1st May of Cacak). That firm has been buying 
stone, ground and assorted, at YUD20.00 [Yugoslav dinars] per 
ton while transport from the quarry to Cacak, some 100 km away, 
costs another YUD30.00 perton. The general conclusion was that 
with such prices of transport it was very difficult to be 
competitive on the world market, as it will be on the domestic 
market as soon as borders open. 
  Mr. Milan Milatovic, director of the firm Mermer of 
Danilovgrad, spoke from his angle about bureaucratic obstacles 
which prevented development of the raw material base. That 
factory was lucky that after Yugoslavia's disintegration it 
remained practically the only manufacturer of stone on the 
territory of the new state. Thus there has been no problem with 
sales, the problem being how to satisfy all needs. But, Mr. 
Milatovic sald, while in neighboring Italy only two papers were 
needed to open a new site, in Yugoslavia one had to pay 
YUD100,000.00 to get those papers. 
  Mr. Ranko Zizic, director of the Kondor Holding Company, 
spoke in particular about results achieved in substituting 
products manufactured in some ex-Yugoslav republics or abroad. 
That firm has been specializing in hydro and thermo insulation 
programs, building construction chemistry, flooring and 
ceramics. Regardless of the relatively large number of factories 
in that field however, Mr. Zizic stressed, there have been 
many products whose manufacture has not been mastered, although 
there is no reason why they should not be produced in our 
country. Raw materials for many of them exist on the spot and 
they had been purchased here by many, transported, e.g., to 
Slovenia, where some additives had been added, they were 
packaged again and then returned to be sold on this market. 
Initial results achieved in that field have been significant but 
not sufficient. There has been much space and many products 
which could be manufactured by local factories, of course on the 
same footing as regards prices and quality with those found on 
the world market. 
  Finally, several participants in the discussion stressed the 
necessity to preserve existing factories in order to prevent 
that after sanction are lifted (and judging by vistis of foreign 
partners some have been forecasting that that need not be so far 
away) we would be forced to import products for which we have 
not only raw materials but also know how and most advanced 
technology.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava -- [passage omitted] Asked by SME 
about his course of action regarding the request to have members 
of the coalition government screened, Prime Minister Jozef 
Moravcik replied that at present he cannot ask the Slovak 
Information Service [SIS] to issue screening certificates for 
government members because it would constitute an illegal act. 
Even though the prime minister had requested screenings, he did 
so on the basis of material law [hmotny zakon]. "After we 
realized that the procedural conditions had not been met, we 
agreed that the screening certificates would not be issued," 
Jozef Moravcik said.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Growing Distrust of Current Political </F>
Leaders"] 
  [Text] Another increase in distrust of politicians is 
signalled by a public opinion survey carried out by the Slovak 
Statistical Office in the first 10 days of May. The percentage 
of respondents who did not find a single trustworthy person 
among Slovak politicians increased from 25 in April to 35 in 
May. In the survey, the Slovak Statistical Office approached a 
representative sample of 1,273 adult citizens of the Slovak 
Republic who were asked to name a maximum of three personalities 
active in political life [who they trust]. The table below 
contains the names of only those politicians who were identified 
in May 1994 as trustworthy personalities by at least 2 percent 
of respondents. No politician was trusted by 35 percent of 
respondents in May, 25 percent in April, and 31 percent in March.

  [Excerpt] The Tolerance Movement [Hnutie Tolerancia, HT] 
was registered at the Ministry of Interior on 12 May. Two days 
later, it held its constituent congress. The movement's 
leadership, composed of chairwoman Anna Galovicova, PhD, deputy 
chairman Lubomir Sausa, and secretary Imrich Ciffra, visited our 
editorial office yesterday to inform us about the plans and 
goals of this new political entity. 
  The movement was established as a force of harmonization, 
whose task is to free us of emotional conflicts and campaign and 
post- election struggles. The HT wants to run in the early 
parliamentary elections independently, but it is not opposed to 
cooperation with other political entities either. It has 
launched a petition campaign to obtain the required number of 
signatures to participate in elections to the National Council 
of the Slovak Republic. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Ivan Drabek: "Vladimir Zhirinovskiy Will Not Come </F>
to Slovakia"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava/Moscow -- [passage omitted] 
Grigoriy Serebrennikov, press secretary of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia [LDP] parliamentary group, informed 
SME by telephone about the circumstances of the sudden change in 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's program. According to Serebrennikov, 
Zhirinovskiy intends radically to limit his trips abroad in the 
future. The LDP leader decided not to travel to Slovakia under 
the impression of his visit to Saratov on Wednesday [18 May] 
where, according to Serebrennikov, he saw with his own eyes the 
dramatic situation the country finds itself in. "Factories are 
standing still, people have not received any wages since 
January, a social explosion is looming. Vladimir Volfovich 
reached the conclusion that his task is now to tour Russian 
cities and to talk to the people there so that, when the 
situation comes to a head tomorrow, they are able to orient 
themselves and seek a solution in support of the LDP," 
Serebrennikov said. According to the LDP press secretary, the 
trip to Slovakia has not been postponed but canceled. In the 
foreseeable future, there will not be a single opening in 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's busy schedule. [passage omitted] 
  [Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 20 May on pages 1 and 2 
carries a 500-word Vladimir Jancura, Boris Latta report, 
entitled "Visit Postponed Again," which provides a different 
explanation for the cancellation of Zhirinovskiy's visit to 
Slovakia. According to the report, Bratislava lawyer Jozef 
Lauko, who describes himself as "Zhirinovskiy's friend of long 
standing," told the PRAVDA reporters that three members of 
Zhirinovskiy's entourage "had problems with their travel 
documents. It seems that the 'AB-Sluzhebnaya' stamp, 
identifying holders of official passports, was missing in them." 
Lauko voices the assumption that the three men in question were 
Zhirinovskiy's personal bodyguards and that "for understandable 
reasons, the party leadership did not permit Mr. Zhirinovskiy to 
travel without bodyguards."]

<F P=106> [Article by Jergus Ferko: "How the Secret Pact Between </F>
Moravcik's and Duray's Coalition Is Being Implemented; No to 
Alternative Education -- Yes to School Autonomy?"] 
  [Excerpts] We have already written about the coalition's 
political dependence on ethnic Hungarian parties. Even though 
government representatives claim that there is no secret 
agreement, facts prove the exact opposite. We have ascertained 
that the eight- point catalogue of Hungarian politicians' 
demands was the subject of Coalition Council talks 
and has been discussed at other important forums as well. The 
third point of the secret pact between Moravcik's and Duray's 
coalition reads: "To halt the organizing of alternative 
education in areas inhabited by Hungarians." 
  Let us recall: Alternative education (and not alternative 
schools as certain gentlemen imprecisely write) is quite normal 
in areas with mixed populations in the advanced world. Under 
this method, children learn not only their mother tongue but, at 
the same time, they also master the state language perfectly 
(see, for instance, the bright example of South Tyrol). Under 
this policy, some subjects are taught in the mother tongue and 
some in the state language. The parents decide what is best for 
their children. In Slovakia, however, the national minority 
politicians know better than the parents. [passage omitted] 
  On Wednesday [18 May], Minister of Education Lubomir Harach 
recalled Lydia Bencova from the post of director of the 
Department for Ethnic Education, without giving any reasons. Is 
it possible that the true reason was the dissatisfaction of the 
minister's "voluntary" advisers with Lydia Bencova because she 
had enforced the project of alternative education? The fact is 
that [ethnic Hungarian] deputies V. Bugar, J. Fothy, and A. 
Duka-Zolyomi are all very frequent guests at this ministry. 
[passage omitted] 
  In addition to the evidently functioning secret pact between 
Moravcik's and Duray's coalition, one can also discover at the 
Ministry of Education the phantom of proletarian 
internationalism. Virtually all the leading figures of this 
government department are distinguished by their "more than 
pink" political past (we may still return to this issue in 
greater detail in SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA). Evidently the phantom of 
educational autonomy is also present there, which -- as is known 
-- represents one of the strategic goals of Hungarian policy in 
Slovakia. [passage omitted] After all, it is necessary to also 
fulfill the other points of the pact with Hungarian parties. 
For example, its point six reads: "To set up minority 
departments at the Ministries of Education and Culture, within 
the framework of which there will be separate Hungarian 
sections...." Educational autonomy is thus beginning to acquire 
realistic features. Otherwise, the Hungarians, who hold the 
balance of power, might withhold their support, as Miklos Duray 
let himself be heard. Whether the Hungarian minority and, more 
specifically, Hungarian children, will derive any benefit from 
this is, apparently, an altogether different question. It is a 
question, for example, also for the president, who should not 
keep quiet when the state interests of Slovakia are threatened.

<F P=106> ["is"-signed report: "Slovak Republic's Balance of Payments </F>
for 1993 Shows a Moderate Surplus, But at the Cost of Growing 
Indebtedness Abroad" -- all figures as published] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- According to the report on monetary 
development in the Slovak Republic in 1993, which has been drawn 
up by the Slovak National Bank [NBS], the consolidated balance 
of trade ended in a deficit of 31.961 billion Slovak korunas 
[Sk] ($1.038 billion), the balance of services in a surplus of 
Sk12.843 billion ($417.1 million), the balance of yields 
(interest rates, investments, wages of citizens working abroad) 
in a deficit of Sk1.17 billion ($38 million), and the balance of 
current transfers in a surplus of Sk3.077 billion ($99.9 
million). The total balance of the current account of the 
balance of payments as the sum total of the preceding balances 
was therefore in deficit to the tune of Sk17.211 billion ($559 
million). 
  After including the balance on the capital and financial 
account, which ended in a surplus of Sk17.790 billion ($675.9 
million), and the item of mistakes and errors (minus Sk1.111 
billion, that is, minus $58 million), the total balance of 
payments of the Slovak Republic ended in a surplus of Sk1.69 
billion ($58.5 million). However, this positive result of the 
balance of payments is attributable, to a large extent, to 
credits taken abroad -- the issue of NBS bonds to an amount of 
Sk7.6 billion, an IMF loan of Sk3 billion, a World Bank loan of 
Sk1.1 billion, import liabilities of the entrepreneurial sector 
of Sk8.7 billion, and the drawing on resources from commercial 
banks' lines of credit to an amount of Sk6.8 billion. The 
external indebtedness of the Slovak Republic increased last 
year, with the gross debt in foreign currency reaching $3.622 
billion by the end of the year.

  [Text] Mochovce -- Without further expert analyses and, 
most important of all, the realization of measures, the 
depository for radioactive waste being built near the Mochovce 
nuclear power station in Levice district cannot, given its 
present state, be considered prepared to meet the task assigned 
to it. This was stated, among other things, by Douglas Champ 
from Canada, the head of a team of International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] experts, at a news conference in Mochovce 
yesterday. Since the beginning of this week, the international 
group of experts has been studying in Mochovce all important 
aspects of radioactive waste storage at the depository adjacent 
to the power station, possibilities of enhancing the 
depository's safety, requirements for control, technology, and 
professional qualifications of the maintenance staff, as well as 
the progress of finishing work. The experts reached the 
conclusion that the concept of storing radioactive waste to be 
used at Mochovce is good and that, following the implementation 
of recommended measures, storage will be reliable and safe. 
According to Douglas Champ, the recommendations will encompass 
a wide range of ideas, ranging from design, construction, 
specifications of the waste, and measurement of limits, down to 
public relations.

<F P=106> [Report by Sead Susovic from the Information Service of the </F>
1st Army Corps] 
  [Excerpt] Counting probably on the factor of surprise, the 
chetniks carried out a strong attack on the city's defense lines 
in the Hladivode region late last night. This futile attack 
began with fierce shooting from light infantry weapons. The 
chetniks then started gradually to introduce anti-aircraft guns 
and machineguns, mortars, and similar types of weapons. The 
fighting culminated with the infantry attack, which the ever 
ready defenders of Sarajevo uncompromisingly repelled, forcing 
the chetniks to return to where they set off on their night 
adventure. The town is quiet this morning, but one must not 
forget to remain cautious. 
  The Ilijas front, which has been simmering with chetnik 
attacks for several days, was subjected to a fierce artillery 
attack during which more than 100 shells landed on [word 
indistinct] Brdo, [words indistinct] and other places in the 
free territory. The chetniks also carried out attacks from 
artillery and armored mechanized weapons from their position in 
Nisici, (?Buljetovac), Medojevici, Nabozici, (?Pudraz), and 
Duboki Potok. There are dozens of these weapons in this region. 
They are mainly inside the Sarajevo 20 km zone. [passage

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 25 (TANJUG) -- One woman was killed 
and 13 people were wounded in a Moslem artillery attack on the 
Sarajevo front on Tuesday [24 May] which grossly violated the 
truce, Bosnian Serb military sources have said. The command of 
the Sarajevo-Romanija corps of the Bosnian Serb army specified 
that Moslem forces fired 13 82mm-calibre mortar shells on the 
Srednje district on the Sarajevo-Olovo road and that one shell 
fell near a bus. The shell explosion killed one woman and 
injured 13 passengers, two of them seriously. 
  The woman was the 32nd victim in Serb-controlled areas of 
Sarajevo since a truce for Sarajevo was signed on February 9 
this year and the city was proclaimed an exclusion zone under 
protection of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), 
the Bosnian Serb military sources said. The sources also said 
that 79 people were wounded in Moslem attacks, mostly from small 
arms, rifles with telescopic sights, and grenade launchers. The 
Moslem side is constantly violating the truce, primarily as a 
result of the complete lack of action by UNPROFOR who have not 
once reacted to warnings sent by the command of the 
Sarajevo-Romanija Corps of the Bosnian Serb army, the command 
said.

  [Text] Washington, May 26 (TANJUG) -- U.S. State Department 
spokesman Mike McCurry said on Wednesday [25 May] that the 
Bosnian Muslims and Serbs were testing the resolve of the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and of NATO as regards the Sarajevo 
and Gorazde exclusion zones and added that the United States was 
concerned when any of the sides violated the zones. This is the 
first time that the U.S. has officially admitted that the 
Bosnian Muslim army is using the exclusion zones for launching 
attacks and provocations. 
  Commenting a statement by Bosnian Muslim leader Alija 
Izetbegovic that his government would ask Washington to take a 
definite stand on the European proposal for the territorial 
division in Bosnia-Herzegovina before making its own decision on 
the issue, McCurry said that Izetbegovic was familiar with the 
U.S. stand on the proposed peace settlement. Foreign ministers 
of the United States, Russia and the European Union called on 
the Bosnian warring sides on May 13 in Geneva to agree to a 
four-month truce, during which they would divide the territory 
according to the E.U. formula: 49 per cent of the territory for 
the Serbs and 51 per cent for the Muslim-Croat federation. 
  McCurry said that, in its diplomatic contacts on all levels, 
Washington had informed the Muslim leadership not only of the 
division formula but also of the U.S. readiness to actively 
participate in maintaining peace once the warring sides reached 
a peace agreement through dialogue. The Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats came to Wednesday's peace talks on Bosnia in Talloires, 
France, with the demand for 58 per cent of the territory.

  [Text] Doboj, May 25 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces on Wednesday 
[25 March] continued attacking Serb settlements and army 
positions in the northern part of the former Yugoslav republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was also confirmed by the United 
Nations Protection Force. The most intensive Moslem fire, from 
all available infantry and artillery weapons, was reported on 
the Teslic front, Bosnian Serb Army sources said. Serb Army 
units were forced to return fire in order to protect lives and 
positions. 
  Moslem forces fired 11 shells on Teslic itself but the 
attack 
fortunately caused only damage to local facilities without any 
casualties. On the southern part of the Teslic battlefront, a 
large Moslem terrorist group was sent to penetrate deep into the 
Serb territory and carry out silent liquidation of Serb 
civilians and other terrorist actions, Bosnian Serb Army sources 
said, adding that the group had suffered a heavy defeat after 
walking into a mine field. 
  The group left behind much of their equipment while trying 
to 
escape and take the wounded with them. On the Ozren battlefront 
south of Doboj, Moslem forces opened infantry and sniper fire on 
Serb settlements and, after massing troops in the vicinity of 
Serb defence lines on the south-western part of the front, made 
frequent and violent reconnaissance missions, said Serb Army 
sources. 
  Bosnian Serb Army units were forced to return fire and 
prevent this kind of activity, they said. On the southern part 
of the Vozuca battlefront, Moslem forces opened strong artillery 
fire on Serb positions after bringing in fresh troops. The Serb 
Army returned fire, it was announced. 
  Moslem assaults were also reported on the Trebava front. 
  Moslem and Croat forces in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina are 
preparing an offensive whose aim is to cut the land corridor 
linking the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb 
Republic.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, May 25 (AFP) -- Moslem-led Bosnian 
Government forces Wednesday [25 May] pressed on for the second 
day an offensive against Serbs west of Tesanj, in the north of 
the country, the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] said here. 
[passage omitted] On the ground, EC observers reported that 
Tuesday's fighting, which involved artillery exchanges, left at 
least three dead among government forces and nine among 
civilians, according to Major Rob Annink, spokesman for 
UNPROFOR. Annink also pointed to the presence of three tanks, 
two of them Soviet model T-84s, in government lines, the first 
time they had been noticed in the region. He was unable to say 
whether the tanks were part of the Bosnian Army's armor or 
whether they had been borrowed from local HVO [Croatian Defense 
Council] Croat forces, now their nominal allies. 
  The Bosnian forces were pushing westwards, towards the 
Serb-held town of Teslic, possibly in order to seize some 
strategic heights and so bolster their defensive positions, 
Annink said. The government attack was a "limited" one, but was 
"well prepared and continuing," he said. 
  Further north, calm returned to the outskirts of the 
Serb-held town of Brcko, an area linking western Bosnia to 
Serbia. On Monday, government forces fired 10 shells at the 
town, five of which hit a power transformer, Annink said. 
Elsewhere in the country, there were clashes in the Bugojno and 
Turbe regions of central Bosnia and near Kladanj and Dastansko, 
northeast of here. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The news that has leaked from the self-proclaimed 
Yugoslavia has caused enormous dissatisfaction and protests 
among Velika Kladusa residents. Fikret Abdic has gone so far 
with his collaboration with Serbia and Milosevic that he has 
reached -- course, well away from the eyes of the people of the 
Cazin Krajina -- agreement on the training of Kladusa young men 
in the famous barracks of the army of the so-called Yugoslavia 
in Nis, where the special units of the Serbian aggressor army 
are trained. This was stated by the Information Service of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Instead of being in the units of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the young men from Velika Kladusa are 
learning together with Perisic's and Mladic's special units all 
the techniques of killing the Bosniaks. This has caused disgust 
and open disagreements of ordinary people in Velika Kladusa with 
Babo [Fikret Abdic]. 
  According to initial reports, Abdic has sent a group of 
policemen of the self-proclaimed Autonomous Province of Western 
Bosnia for training in Nis. Some men refused to go to Nis. The 
most disobedient were liquidated. Their murder was concealed 
with claims that they were killed in clashes with the 5th Army 
Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The agreement on training is only part of a much wider 
agreement between Fikret Abdic and the chetniks. They agreed 
that Abdic's paramilitary should attack the left and the 
chetniks, via Grabez, the right bank of the Una River. This was 
stated by the Information Service of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government at today's 
session, which was chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Edib Bukvic, 
passed the [word indistinct] Law on the Government of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Law on Ministries and Other 
Offices of the State Administration, the Law on the Government 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and the Law on Ministries 
and State Administration Offices of the Federation. 
  Until a final peace agreement for Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
reached, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government will perform the role 
of the government of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation. The 
government will consist of a prime minister, a deputy prime 
minister, 11 ministers to oversee ministries, and four ministers 
without portfolio. The deputy prime minister will also act as 
the defense minister. The ministers in charge of ministries 
must ensure that their deputies do not come from the same 
constituent ethnic group as them. 
  The Ministry for Special Purposes Production, the Ministry 
of 
Economy, the Ministry of Reconstruction and Development, the 
Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Transport and 
Communication, the Ministry of Trade, and the Ministry of 
Information will cease to exist. 
  Based on the Bosnia-Herzegovina Constitution, the internal 
structure of the territory with a majority Bosniak and Croatian 
population in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been 
transformed and a segment of the executive functions of the 
federation allocated to the government of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Federation. The ministries of the federation are: the Defense 
Ministry; the Ministry of Internal Affairs; the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of 
Justice; the Ministry of Energy and Industry; the Ministry of 
Transport and Communications; the Ministry of Urbanism, 
Resources, and Protection of Environment; the Ministry of Trade; 
the Ministry of Refugees and Social Policy; the Ministry of 
Health; and the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government also passed a draft law on 
the Official Gazette of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation.

  [Text] Zvornik, May 25 (TANJUG) -- The Serb population of 
Tuzla, Moslem-controlled industrial town in northeast Bosnia, 
has recently become, along with the persecution initiated long 
ago, the subject of unprecedented trade, TANJUG learned on 
Wednesday from Vojislav Djurkovic, the representatives of a 
State Commission for the Exchange of the Population. Djurkovic 
said that Serbs who want to leave the Tuzla area have to pay 
between 1,000-1,500 German marks per person. The Tuzla area is 
a specific prison for the Serbs, Djurkovic said and added that 
it is believed that 20,000 Serbs still remain in the region. 
  Both the world public and the humanitarian institutions have 
shown insufficient interest in the destiny and salvation of the 
Tuzla Serbs, although the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
Commander for Bosnia, General Philippe Morillon, had promised to 
enable them to leave for the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS), 
Djurkovic recalled. The issue of the Tuzla Serbs remains open, 
but the opening of the Tuzla airport, allegedly solely for 
humanitarian purposes, remains in the focus of interest of many 
in the world, he said. 
  About 7,000 Serbs and other nationals have so far left Tuzla 
through official exchanges with RS and Yugoslavia, while another 
3,000 civilians have fled mainly individually via the front 
lines, Djurkovic said. Quoting eye-witness reports, Djurkovic 
said that numerous Serbs had been liquidated such as in cases 
when they were forced to cross mine fields when leaving 
Moslem-controlled territories for RS. 
  The Tuzla refugees, who also include Croats, claim that the 
Serbs have been stripped of all their rights in this town. Many 
were killed, imprisoned, tortured and humiliated with the tacit 
agreement of the Moslem local and regional authorities, 
Djurkovic said. He said that many Tuzla Serbs are literally 
living in the streets since the authorities have evicted them 
out of their homes so that now they roam the town without food 
and clothing. 
  The months-long persistent attempts by the Serb side to 
convince the Tuzla authorities to agree to an exchange of the 
population, remain futile. The Serb side, primarily motivated 
by humanitarian reasons, decided to unilaterally organize the 
reunification of separated families, i.e. to enable the arrival 
in Tuzla not only of Moslems living in Semberija, where they 
live in freedom and safety, but also of those from the territory 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia who wish to leave, 
Djurkovic said. 
  The exchange is in preparation and should be attended by the 
representatives of international humanitarian organizations, he 
said.

<F P=106> [Debate between Gyula Horn, leading Hungarian Socialist </F>
Party candidate, and Gabor Kuncze, leading candidate for the 
Alliance of Free Democrats, in the studio in Budapest; moderated 
by an unidentified announcer -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Good evening, viewers. We are 
broadcasting a special edition of the election series, which 
presents party opinions. We have invited those heading the 
lists of the parties that were most successful in the first 
round of the elections. I greet here in the studio Gyula Horn, 
heading the list of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], and 
Gabor Kuncze, who heads the list of the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ]. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Let us speak about the economy. [passage 
omitted] 
You have said that if you come to power, there will be no need 
for a 100-day grace period. I imagine you were hinting at 
economic issues. [passage omitted] 
  [Kuncze] I say there is no need for 100 days of grace 
because 
in my opinion the next government will have to take action 
immediately. Of course, this is not separate from the fact that 
it is necessary to be familiar with the situation that the next 
government will inherit. We also are of the firm opinion that a 
very detailed coalition agreement must be concluded because only 
on this basis will it be possible to coordinate positions in the 
future, to prepare a legislative program, to organize government 
work, and to ensure that there is a stable coalition behind the 
government. [passage omitted] 
  [Horn] Allow me to continue what Gabor Kuncze began. In my 
view, at the same time coalition talks are held it will be 
necessary to gain an idea of the country's situation, to gain an 
idea of what legacy awaits the new government. [passage omitted] 
Only then -- on the basis of chapters such as the coalition 
agreement conditions consisting not just of economic matters but 
constitutional matters and others -- will it be possible to 
define the most urgent tasks that must be accomplished by the 
end of 1994. Last, but not least, the next government must 
differ from the current one in that much should be done to 
simplify bureaucracy. This would facilitate the greater influx 
of working capital, which would facilitate ventures, and other. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] You emphasize an active economic policy. What 
measures do you intend to take? 
  [Kuncze] After a possible coalition agreement has been 
reached, after the conditions have been created for more 
effective government and parliamentary work, and after the legal 
amendments have been passed, there could be a need in 1994 for a 
supplementary budget. It is necessary to set to work immediately 
on amending the laws that regulate privatization. [passage 
omitted] The same applies to the legal package that regulates 
agriculture; it is necessary in this case to create a 
satisfactory system of market information, a satisfactory credit 
system, a system of support that can be used more effectively 
than now. Politics must withdraw from the villages and it must 
leave those involved in agriculture to work on the basis of 
their own knowledge and interests. 
  Remaining with the subject of 1994 -- the package of laws on 
self-government must be amended so that those running in the 
local elections can do so in accordance with the new conditions. 
The education laws ought to be reviewed. By way of example, we 
feel that the system of university tuition fees cannot be 
introduced beginning in September. Something must be done in 
connection with the question of the national curriculum. 
  In the second half of 1994 the parliament will have to enact 
amendments to the legislation on taxation. I am thinking here 
of tax reductions, tax concessions, and amendments of 
regulations to encourage investments, which will come into force 
as of 1 January 1995. The National Assembly this year will have 
to adopt the budget for 1995. [passage omitted] 
  Our opinion is that the proportions will have to turned 
around; greater emphasis must be placed on preparation of the 
laws, and the parliament, by working more effectively, must be 
able to enact the laws more quickly. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Both of you have mentioned social 
responsiveness. It has particularly been stressed by Gyula 
Horn. [passage omitted] It is obvious that the trade unions 
might have a determining role. What is your opinion about this? 
Will this trade union interest succeed within the traditional 
and desirable interest coordination mechanism, or within the 
parliament, through a certain kind of trade union faction within 
the MSZP? 
  [Kuncze] The SZDSZ regards interest coordination -- both 
with 
employees and employers -- as a very important issue. In this 
respect, naturally, we accept the trade unions as partners. We 
also accept this certain social agreement with the interest 
representation organizations [referring to the MSZP's proposal], 
not without any reason, because this proposal was also included 
in the SZDSZ's crisis management program issued in 1991. 
[passage omitted] 
  However, this cannot happen in any way other than outside 
parliament, because the essence of this is that these agreements 
then have to be approved by parliament. Parliament, naturally, 
has an opportunity to exercise control over these agreements. 
We are not talking about automatic mechanisms here. 
Parliament's authority will remain in this respect. However, 
because the leaders of the largest trade unions will enter 
parliament on the MSZP's list, there is a danger that these 
interest coordination mechanisms will take place within the 
party, or perhaps within the MSZP's parliamentary group of 
deputies, and not in public. 
  We would not approve of this. We are in favor of openness in 
this respect. We accept and approve of this coordination 
outside parliament, with the involvement of the government and 
the trade unions. This certain economic-social agreement has to 
be reached with these conditions, and the widest possible range 
of questions should be included in this debate. 
  [Horn] This is a perpetual debate between us. [passage 
omitted] Assuming that the SZDSZ also wants a social market 
economy, it is obvious that the social partnership cannot be 
established without the trade unions. [passage omitted] 
  Another point is that the MSZP -- within or outside the 
party 
-- will not conclude any kind of pact with players in society 
which is not made public. Therefore, if we have any kind of 
stance in connection with the trade unions, or in connection 
with the earlier mentioned economic-social agreement, it will be 
entirely public. The SZDSZ will be informed about it as well as 
anyone else and the public. That is entirely true. 
  The third element -- forgive me for saying it -- that six of 
the 176 individual candidates running in MSZP colors were from 
the leadership of the National Federation of Hungarian Trade 
Unions, will not determine the Socialist Party's policy. I 
hope, however, that they will influence it. The party, which 
has had good relations with the representatives of trade unions 
for years, has an advantageous position. [passage omitted] 
  The Hungarian trade unions do not come up with impossible 
demands that cannot be fulfilled. They support all their 
demands with professional arguments. [passage omitted] 
  [Kuncze] I have to argue with you a certain point. I have to 
repeat that the interest coordination process has to take place 
outside parliament; it is a governmental task. I agree with you 
that the law on legislation has to be amended in this respect; 
the trade unions' rights have to be included. However, I would 
not consider it desirable if these coordination talks were also 
carried out within the parliament. It is the government's 
responsibility to conclude and observe these agreements. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Forty-five minutes have passed. There remains 
a very important question -- foreign policy. What role should 
the ethnic Hungarians living as minorities have in our relations 
with neighboring countries in drafting the basic treaties? 
  [Horn] In our view a basic treaty proclaims two fundamental 
points: One is the inviolability of borders, while -- closely 
connected with this -- the other is the full guarantee of the 
rights of the national minorities, the Hungarians, living there. 
That is one thing. 
  The other thing is that we naturally would coordinate the 
conclusion of such a treaty with the political interest 
representation organizations of the ethnic Hungarians living in 
the given country -- whether the country in question is Slovakia 
or Romania. 
  My conviction is that what the MSZP (?says), that there 
should be historical reconciliation with neighbors, is 
unavoidable. The sooner we do this, the sooner we try to 
realize this in practice, the better. One can proclaim an 
awareness of our mission, one can say a lot about historical 
grievances -- this will not lead anywhere. The sooner there is 
national consensus on the question of the necessity of 
historical reconciliation and, on the basis of this, on the need 
for an active relationship-building policy, the sooner we will 
be able to sort out our relationships and the sooner our country 
will become more secure. 
  I assert that we will be able to assist more the situation 
of 
Hungarians living in the given country. 
  [Announcer] I am also curious about the opinion of the 
SZDSZ. 
  [Kuncze] I agree that the basic treaties can be concluded 
only if on the other side, the satisfactory guarantees exist for 
the assertion of the minority rights of the Hungarians beyond 
the border. The problem is that because of this, it is very 
difficult to make progress in the conclusion of basic treaties. 
For this reason we also place emphasis on the need to take 
concrete, practical steps in every case when the opportunity 
arises -- whether it is an economic matter, whether it is the 
opening of a university or an educational issue, or the issue of 
bilingualism, or other issues. 
  We emphasize the necessity of maintaining this dialogue. 
Otherwise these basic treaties are, indeed, important, and they 
should be concluded on the broadest possible bases. This is our 
political interest as well, because we can enter an integrated 
Europe only with settled relations with our neighbors. It is 
also our economic interest, because we could perhaps have 
markets there. If the economies of those countries improve, this 
will give rise to a suitable improvement for Hungarians beyond 
the border. 
  Until then, the Hungarian Government must handle this area 
with special importance. From here, we do not have to say how 
the organizations of the Hungarians beyond the borders should 
conduct their political activities. It is up to them to shape 
their politics. The Hungarian Government in power must accept 
what they have shaped, and it must always ask for the opinion of 
the organizations of the Hungarians beyond the border concerning 
the fostering of relations with neighboring countries. 
  Our interest is that they should seek their expectations 
where they were born, and that is where they should live a 
satisfactory existence. Allow me to add something: Our 
integration into Europe is important not just for us, but for 
neighboring countries as well. This will make those borders one 
line on the map, and this question will no longer be one that is 
subject to dispute. 
  [Announcer] A brief question in conclusion: How many seats 
do you feel you have a realistic chance of getting? Mr Horn? 
  [Horn] It is very difficult to predict, and I do not like to 
predict. I imagine about 170-180 seats. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Kuncze? 
  [Kuncze] We earlier aimed at repeating, at the minimum, our 
performance in 1990. That means about 90-100 seats in the next 
parliament. 
  [Announcer] Thank you for coming to the studio.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F>
Horn by Mihaly Bak; place and date not given: "Politics and 
Coalition Are Not Pure Mathematics"] 
  [Text] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] does not 
consider the issue of the accident closed, Gyula Horn has said. 
They wish to form a coalition with the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ], and this will have to be decided by the 
programs. Personal issues cannot be of major importance. 
  [Bak] The interior minister expressed his indignation 
because you had cast doubt over the police's unbiased 
investigation and had not excluded the possibility of 
premeditated attack. This phase of the investigation was closed 
last week. Are you more relaxed now? 
  [Horn] The television program "A Het" has adhered to its 
former practice and again failed to ask me. I would have told 
them that the police had not supported its claim with anything. 
This is the reason we do not consider the investigation closed. 
The statements made by the car's passengers were not taken into 
consideration. 
  [Bak] According to the police, apart from personal guard 
Jeno Zsidey, no one else mentioned any phenomena that might cast 
doubt on the accident verdict. According to our information, 
others have mentioned similar things. 
  [Horn] I am not familiar with the statements by the others, 
but I also saw the flash. I told this to the policeman in 
Miskolc. I am sorry the police issued a statement the day after 
the accident and it did not want to change this later. 
  [Bak] In fact, statements that were contradictory in certain 
details have been published. 
  [Horn] This is true. Make no mistake, we are not seeking 
anything in the background. We would have preferred the police 
to make an official statement when all details were known. This 
is one of the reasons the MSZP is not leaving events at that. 
  [Bak] According to a recent view, it is a conscious goal of 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] for the MSZP to gain as big 
a majority as possible because then the SZDSZ would not join it 
in a coalition. 
  [Horn] I cannot see much change in the MDF's style. It 
continues to see the MSZP as its main opponent, although the MDF 
is unlikely to be in competition in the second round. It is 
useless to frighten the citizens with our "too much of a 
victory." We will find out after the elections who can work 
together with whom. Regardless of our results, we still want a 
coalition. 
  [Bak] Many members of the SZDSZ are worried that the MSZP 
will achieve a parliamentary majority on its own and then the 
SZDSZ will have very little say in the decisions. 
  [Horn] Politics is not pure mathematics. Those who are 
afraid of our "too much of a victory" -- for example the MDF -- 
take themselves as an example. In our view, a political style 
that is different from the current one is the basis of the 
coalition. 
  [Bak] In multiparty parliamentary systems, the decisive 
majority of a single party is undesirable. 
  [Horn] Very clear rules of cooperation are needed between 
the partners. What the Christian Democratic People's Party 
[KDNP] says, namely that it only bears responsibility for the 
government's decisions in proportion to its weight in the 
coalition, cannot be repeated. Without the KDNP, many harmful 
laws could not have been made. Anyway, what should we do? 
Shall we say to the voters that you have voted for us but do 
not do it again? 
  [Bak] On which points do you see much difference in the 
programs? 
  [Horn] It is important what we do with the distribution 
systems, namely the health service and social security. There 
is a difference in the programs on creating workplaces. In our 
view, it is not enough to stimulate the enterprises to create 
workplaces. We see this as an overall government program. In 
my view, there is a good chance of achieving agreement on this 
issue. 
  [Bak] In your view, how united is the SZDSZ in the desire to 
form a coalition? 
  [Horn] They have a big debate. I have spoken to many of 
their leaders in recent days. In my experience, some of them 
definitely want to participate in the coalition. However, it is 
impossible without compromises. 
  [Bak] The MSZP also has debates. To what extent will these 
influence the future talks? 
  [Horn] A small part of the membership and the politically 
influential people dispute the views of the majority. This 
equally applies to the so-called liberal and the 
popular-national wings. Both of these are a negligible minority 
compared with the center but their voice is always louder. 
  [Bak] Do you agree that your accident was useful to a number 
of people in the party? To a certain extent, you have been 
pushed into the background compared to others. 
  [Horn] This would be true if I was mentally less able than 
before. I would not like to upset anyone but I am on the same 
level as before. 
  [Bak] Nevertheless, you are restricted from participating in 
daily politics. 
  [Horn] The doctors asked me to take it easy in the interest 
of rehabilitation. However, the injury did not influence the 
big issue, namely the elections that were decided a few days 
after the accident. I am to participate in a number of campaign 
debates in the coming days. I know that viewers will have some 
aesthetic hardship looking at my "spaceship gear." Perhaps some 
will believe that I get inspiration through this. As a matter 
of fact, in my view, it would not alter the results if the 
parties did not campaign between the two rounds. It is unlikely 
that people who have decided whom to vote for can be influenced 
now. The general public is not much interested in the messages 
sent by the political elite to each other.

  [Text] Warsaw, 26 May (PAP) -- While assessing Wednesday's 
meeting between NATO defense ministers and defense ministers of 
the countries who joined the Partnership for Peace program, 
Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said today in Warsaw that 
he "feels something is lacking" after the meeting. "We are not 
satisfied with the Western countries' way of thinking," 
Kolodziejczyk told journalists. 
  In the Polish defense minister's opinion, the process of 
integration with the European Union [EU], the Western European 
Union [WEU], and NATO should run parallel and not, as the West 
wants, from EU membership through WEU membership to NATO. 
"Maybe we should even join the NATO alliance earlier. We have 
no time," Kolodziejczyk stressed. 
  According to Kolodziejczyk, the idea of Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev, who presented a proposal for a new 
system of European security at the meeting, a system based on 
close cooperation between the CSCE and the North Atlantic 
Council -- must be given some thought. It should not, however, 
block the Partnership for Peace initiative, the minister said. 
Kolodziejczyk believes that many international institutions 
have been ineffective, including the CSCE, as the events in 
former Yugoslavia have shown.

  [Text] Warsaw, 25 May -- During today's meeting between the 
Sejm Commission for Liaison with Poles Abroad and the Senate 
Commission for Immigration and Poles Abroad, Leszek Wasiuta, the 
head of the satellite channel of Polish Television SA [TVP SA-- 
TVPolonia], said his channel was under threat because its status 
was not legalized in the broadcasting law. 
  That is why, in his opinion, TVP SA is not expected to be 
interested in investing TVP SA profits in TVPolonia as at 
present. He says the fact that TVPolonia was set up under Janusz 
Zaorski, the former head of the state radio and television, who 
was in conflict with the National Radio and Television 
Broadcasting Council [KRRiT], may affect this. 
  Danuta Celinska, TVP SA head of programming, has given 
assurances that the board had no intention of closing down 
TVPolonia; on the contrary "it is at the heart of our deepest 
and greatest interests." Also, KRRiT Head Ryszard Bender said 
that the council was not interested in closing down TVPolonia.

<F P=106> [Interview with "Assembly Chairman" Stipe Mesic by D. </F>
Ujevic; place and date not given: "`I am the Assembly 
Chairman'"] 
  [Text] After the Chamber of Representatives elected Dr. 
Nedjeljko Mihanovic as the new Assembly chairman with 74 votes, 
we asked Stjepan Mesic to give us a short comment on the 
decision. 
  [Ujevic] Mr. Mesic, do you still consider yourself to be the 
Assembly chairman? 
  [Mesic] Yes. The Assembly chairman cannot be replaced at 
illegal sessions, regardless of the Rules of Procedure and the 
Constitution. Ultimately, that would mean that the Assembly 
chairman could be relieved of his duties by any group of 
representatives whenever they wanted to, or by any club of 
representatives. 
  [Ujevic] You will therefore treat this Chamber of 
Representatives session as that of the club of the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] representatives? 
  [Mesic] Yes, precisely, although the whole thing did have a 
certain form. However, as it all happened while I was in the 
Assembly building, the decision is illegal. 
  [Ujevic] What could be the repercussions of this situation? 
You obviously do not consider this issue closed. 
  [Mesic] I do not know what the consequences could be, but I 
am Assembly chairman until the new chairman is legally elected. 
  [Ujevic] Will you continue to act as the Assembly chairman? 
  [Mesic] Of course, how else? 
  [Ujevic] Does that mean that you could approach Dr. 
Nedjeljko Mihanovic and ask him to leave the position and let 
you take over? 
  [Mesic] If I convene a session, then I am the legitimate 
chairman. 
  [Ujevic] What if you are asked to move out of the Assembly 
chairman's room? 
  [Mesic] You mean, if I am evicted? Who would do that, 
Nedjeljko Mihanovic?

<F P=106> [Article by Miodrag Vukmanovic: "Substitute for Yeltsin"] </F>
  [Text] The visit paid by Russian Patriarch Aleksiy II to 
the Serbian Orthodox Church was announced as a first-class 
international event. Television moderators, even those who were 
reminded of "an internal enemy" by the sound of church bells in 
earlier times, competed in who would speak with more inspiration 
and piety about his highness. The arrival of the patriarch of 
Moscow and Russia was interpreted in "all Serbian countries" as 
a diplomatic substitute for what the Serbian politicians with a 
strong affinity to Russia expected from President Yeltsin, who 
-- allegedly out of fear of the West -- does not want to support 
his Serbian brothers openly. Numerous representatives of the 
"Russian people" -- political vagabonds and senile officers of 
the former Red Army who toured Serbia, Montenegro and the 
self-proclaimed republic of Srpska during the last war years, 
inciting the Serbs to rebel and make terror by promising them 
senseless things and raising false hopes of the almighty Russian 
protection -- could not fulfill the requirements set by their 
host. 
<H5>  The Difference </H5>
  Now everyone is raising hopes in the head of the Russian 
Church, which is still a mighty institution with a good 
political rating -- although democracy separates the church from 
the state -- because of the repression it was exposed to during 
the long period of the Soviet leadership. 
  Patriarch Aleksiy II is an outstanding church dignitary who 
uses well-measured words and gestures, as is appropriate for a 
man of his rank. 
  This is what constitutes the difference between him and his 
hosts, the Serbian rulers, whose prayers and public 
announcements are full of a certain hatred and false generosity 
and whose peace messages sound as if they were uttered under 
pressure, which has in no case come from God. The shepherds of 
the people of Saint Sava [Serbs] are probably not very happy to 
express their humble respect for their brother who is partially 
of German origin. 
  Immediately after his arrival in Belgrade, the Russian 
patriarch said that the task he would like to accomplish within 
his mission was to end the bloodshed and solve all problems at 
the negotiating table. Variations of the same sentence were 
also included in other official statements issued in connection 
with the conversation between the two patriarchs. It was 
noticed that both dignitaries wanted to include all parties to 
the conflict in their peace message, that they did not want to 
blame only one party to the conflict, or to differentiate in any 
way between God's unrighteous children. This is the point that 
will make many people mistrust the sincerity of Aleksiy's 
mission. In the spirit of "gospel etiquette," [Serbian] 
Patriarch Pavle advised his nation: "Do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you!" There is the danger, however, 
that many Serbs who can read and write will find a typing 
mistake in this Bible message. 
  It will probably never become known what the dignitaries of 
the two Orthodox churches, in the present situation of huge 
national frustrations in their countries, discussed in private 
and with their closest assistants. Both churches have very 
delicate relations with their respective state leaderships. The 
Saint Sava believers from Pale are closer to the Serbian church 
than "the freshly refurbished" communists in Belgrade, 
regardless of the privileges they returned to the church. Its 
leadership fears that any concession to the West that would 
leave some of the Serbs in the domain of a mighty Catholic or 
Muslim influence would be a danger to the Serbian national 
entity that is derived from the Orthodox religion. 
<H5>  Keeping Up With the West </H5>
  Through many schisms since the 17th century, through Peter's 
reforms and the Catholic influence under Polish rule, as well as 
through the contact with Scandinavian Protestantism in its 
neighborhood, the Russian church has actually kept up with the 
West. The appearance of the "Asiatic" orthodoxy after the 
collapse of communism is not a logical spiritual continuation of 
the Russian state religion. It is rather an anarchist protest 
of "the crazy with Christ," which is used as an explanation for 
unbelievable moves the red and the black are making in the 
present Russia. As far as help for the Serbs is concerned, the 
restrained behavior of the Russian patriarch is not caused by 
his neutral attitude toward the warring factions in the Balkans; 
it arises from his consultation with the Russian state 
leadership. It is not difficult to notice that the patriarch's 
messages for peace and his insistence on negotiations correspond 
to what has been concluded in ministerial meetings in Geneva. 
It was obviously made clear to the Moscow patriarch what the 
limits of help for the Serbs are. 
  After the meeting with Milosevic, the patriarch did not 
spend 
many compliments on his conversation partner. This points to 
the possibility that the conversation was predominantly 
informative and strictly official, accompanied by conventional 
phrases about the traditional friendship between the two 
countries. When travelling to Pale, the Russian patriarch was 
accompanied by persons who were, with good reason, heavily 
accused by Russian diplomats, which has to be interpreted as a 
part of the inevitable protocol. It is not probable that the 
Pale leadership will hear from the head of the Russian Church 
something different from what his hosts in Belgrade heard. What 
they heard can be guessed at, based on the speech delivered by 
Serbian Patriarch Pavle in which he reminded his listeners of 
the time of Arsenije Carnojevic and his petition for mediation 
at the Austrian Court when Russia "was not able to do anything 
in order to help the Serbs." "The Serbs understood" and kept on 
loving Russia. They will probably understand this time also.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Pavol Janik: "What Is the IQ of CIA?"] </F>
  [Text] Apparently the question needs to be openly raised 
about the average IQ of CIA staffers and collaborators, 
particularly in Slovakia. The question is highly topical. It 
seems that, to this day, U.S. official quarters are not properly 
informed [nezorientovali sa] about the Slovak issue, which 
testifies either to the incompetence of its intelligence sources 
or to the provision of deliberately incorrect information to the 
U.S. political leadership by U.S. secret services. 
  After all, we are familiar with this situation from the era 
of so-called socialism when, in some of its stages, particularly 
in the fifties, political institutions were evidently 
manipulated by the state police. One cannot but hope that the 
former communist countries with the Soviet Union in the lead do 
not serve as an example for the contemporary United States in 
this respect. That also applies to the unerring selection of 
evident dummies for the vitally important security structures of 
the state. 
  The present state of affairs is borne out by the continuing 
practice of U.S. institutions to issue official information, 
according to which the situation in Slovakia is similar to that 
in the warring countries of the former Soviet Union.

President of the State Presidency Alija Izetbegovic has written 
to the heads of state of the member countries of the contact

Security Council presiding member. At dawn this morning, the 
Serbian forces began an extensive attack on the Bihac security 
zone, which has been surrounded since the beginning of the war. 
Our troops are putting up a bitter resistance, but the 
situation is extremely grave. I appeal to you to take measures 
for the protection of the Bihac security zone that are in 
accordance with the applicable UN Security Council resolutions. 
The situation is extremely critical and calls for urgent 
action. This is stated at the end of President Izetbegovic's 
letter.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>
  [Text] After yesterday and last night's bestial shelling 
of Bihac and the outskirts of Cazin, the joint aggressors today 
continued their attacks on the Bihac Commune. The chetniks are 
using mortars and howitzers of all calibers to shell the forward 
defense lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau and Grabez, 
while on Hasin Vrh and Vrsak they continue attempts at infantry 
breakthroughs. The 5th Corps members are energetically 
resisting, and the defense lines remain stable. On the other 
parts of the front, they continued using antiaircraft weapons, 
while sniper fire and small arms' fire has intensified. 
  The members of Abdic's paramilitary army are also not quiet. 
They are increasingly collaborating with their allies. In the 
wider area of Trsak, Viskovac, and Todorovo, they haven been 
concentrating fresh forces and hardware since yesterday, and are 
preparing fresh attacks in collaboration with the chetniks. In 
the course of the day, they have been intensifying activity on 
all demarcation lines, using small arms, antiaircraft arms, and 
armor-piercing weapons.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>
  [Text] Throughout last night and this morning chetnik 
artillery has been pounding the Bihac area. From their 
strongholds in Veliki (Radic), and Grabez, the chetniks have 
been shelling parts of this UN protected zone with howitzers and 
mortars, and trying to conceal this behind the [words 
indistinct] conflict caused by Abdic's traitor clique. 
  Dozens of shells were fired overnight at the outskirts of 
Bihac, while the defense lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski 
plateau, Hasin Vrh, and Grabez have been under continuous mortar 
fire. In decisive counterattacks, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
5th Corps has recaptured some of the territory on the plateau, 
inflicting heavy losses on the chetniks in manpower, and 
capturing a large amount of ammunition and equipment. This must 
have been the reason for the start of the chetniks' bestial 
shelling of civilian targets, which also served as a sign to the 
Kladusa traitor paramilitaries to intensify their own attacks on 
the areas of [word indistinct], Pecigrad, (Liskovac), and 
Todorovo.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 26 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb troops have 
made a small advance in the western pocket of Bihac following 
intense shelling of the region, a UN commander stationed in 
Bihac said Thursday [26 May]. Major Jean-Francois Philippe, 
spokesman for the French battalion based in the Moslem-held 
city, said the Serbs advanced by about a kilometre (less than a 
mile) in the southeastern part of the pocket Wednesday after 
launching a barrage of 500 shells against positions of the 
mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army stationed north of the city. 
  The Serbs also reportedly launched infantry assaults on 
several villages north of Bihac, a UN-declared "safe haven." 
Philippe said the Serbs want to reclaim territory captured by 
the Bosnian Army along the Una River and a railway line that 
runs nearby. According to Bosnian military sources, the army 
still controls some 40 kilometres (25 miles) of the railway 
line, which is crucial to the Serbs who are trying to link the 
separatist Croatian region of Krajina with the Serb-held 
stronghold of Banja Luka, in western Bosnia. 
  The Serbs have also started building a railway line in order 
to link the northeastern Bosnian town of Brcko with the nearby 
town of Bijeljina and Serbia proper. Philippe said the 
situation in Bihac was calm Thursday although clashes erupted 
Wednesday evening between government forces and troops loyal to 
Moslem separatist leader Fikret Abdic, who has brokered his own 
ceasefire with the Serbs in areas he controls. 
  Elsewhere in Bosnia Thursday, the army was pursuing its 
offensive against Serb troops in the northern town of Tesanj but 
UN observers stationed in the region said they had not detected 
any territorial gains. In the eastern town of Gorazde, 
meanwhile, Serb commanders were still refusing to pull armed 
troops from a UN-imposed three- kilometre (1.8-mile) exclusion 
zone around the city. 
  Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, the commander of UN 
troops in Bosnia, met Wednesday with Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic in an attempt to convince him to pull government 
troops from the east bank of the Drina River, which runs through 
Gorazde, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman Robert Annink 
said. He said the retreat is the Serbs' "condition for 
withdrawing from the three-kilometre zone." Annink added that 
although a UN resolution on Gorazde does not call for troops 
withdrawal, the belligerants must "make a step to show their 
good faith." The Serbs last weekend ignored a pledge they had 
made to pull their armed forces from the three-kilometre zone. 
  In other developments Thursday, three field clinics donated 
by Britain began operating in Mostar, in southern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, devastated by fighting between Moslems and 
Croats before both sides agreed a federation plan earlier this 
year.

  [Excerpts] The talks the between international mediators 
and the three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina ended in the 
French town of Talloires today. No agreement on the future of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was reached. Journalists were banned from 
the talks venue, and the representatives of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina sides refused to comment. REUTERS reports 
that the Muslim, Serb, and Croat representatives are ready to 
resume talks in France or in Geneva within seven to 10 days. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] It is becoming obvious that the 
secret peace talks were only testing grounds for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's warring sides; a preliminary exchange of 
opinions with the members of the Contact Group who are trying, 
as they stress, to complete their peace-building task in a 
professional and efficient way. [passage omitted] 
  The unity between the Croat and Bosniak delegations was 
noticeable during the talks. They presented good arguments to 
advocate the principles of the Washington and Vienna Agreements. 
In the name of a lasting peace Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir 
Zubak and Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic 
announced a possible retreat from the initial negotiating 
positions of 58 percent for the federation. However, the Serbs 
do not consider the percentage as the most important element. 
They are requesting richer and better quality territories. 
  The maps and haggling over the territorial division 
certainly 
dominated the talks. However, all combinations are still 
possible. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Uzice, Serbia, May 26 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb 
Republic (RS) President Radovan Karadzic said on Thursday [26 
May] that a new peace conference should focus solely on 
territorial issues because political solutions have already been 
reached -- the United States has created a Muslim-Croat 
federation, and the Serbs their own state. We have a solution 
and our own state. We are willing to discuss territories but on 
condition that the sanctions are lifted and a peace established, 
Karadzic said in an interview to Uzice paper VESTI. He added 
that these two states should immediately be recognized. 
  Commenting diplomatic moves for speeding up the peace 
process, Karadzic underscored that the Serb side had told Cyrus 
Vance, Lord David Owen and Vitaliy Churkin that, if they want to 
succeed, they should coordinate their efforts with the Serbs' 
interests. He said that a new peace conference can succeed only 
if a solution is not imposed on the Serbs. The end of the war 
is close because our enemies have tried everything and have 
clearly faced their own powerlessness, Karadzic said and added 
that this powerlessness clashed with the legitimate and 
justified will of the Serb people and their centuries-old wish 
to finally set up their own state. 
  Karadzic believes that the next moves of the Muslim-Croat 
side will be a new offensive out of one of the `safe areas' -- 
Tuzla or Bihac. We will defend ourselves for a time, then we 
will publically warn them, as in the case of Gorazde, and openly 
say that we will launch a counteroffensive in which case they 
will start wailing and the entire world will then try to save 
them and create their state, Karadzic said.

  [Text] Last night, General Michael Rose, commander of the 
UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in Bosnia-Herzegovina, held 
talks with President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic on the 
implementation of the cease-fire and the deployment of peace 
forces on the east bank of the Drina River near Gorazde. This 
was announced today at the UNPROFOR command in Sarajevo. 
  General Rose proposed that Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units 
should withdraw from the east bank of the Drina River and that 
UNPROFOR units should be deployed in their place to protect 
Gorazde and maintain the cease-fire. On the basis of UN 
Security Council Resolution 913 and the NATO ultimatum, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units are not obliged to withdraw from 
either this part of town or the 3-km exclusion zone around 
Gorazde. UNPROFOR representative Major Annink said that the 
NATO ultimatum was still in force. We [words indistinct] the 
situation realistically and we are trying to solve the problem 
in Gorazde through negotiations, said Major Annink today. He 
added that General Rose yesterday attempted to talk to the 
aggressor's leader Radovan Karadzic, but that he had not 
succeeded in this.

  [Text] The statement made yesterday by the UN Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] commander [General Rose] that the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army did not have the strength to retake the 
lost territories met with widespread, mostly negative, 
reactions. That is why we were informed by the Office of the 
President of the Presidency that during last night's talks [with 
General Rose], President Izetbegovic asked General Michael Rose 
to explain his statement. 
  The British general supplemented his earlier remark by 
saying 
that he had also told the Serbs they could not win under any 
conditions. Their infantry is irreparably wounded, said General 
Rose, and in the long run, they would [word indistinct] lose the 
war in Bosnia. The UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
believes that, at the moment, the Serbs cannot defeat the 
Bosniaks, while the Bosniaks do not have the strength to expel 
the occupiers. A firm stalemate has been created in Bosnia, 
which, according to General Rose, is forcing both sides to look 
for a compromise to end the conflict. This is stated in the 
communique issued by the Office of the President of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Excerpt] The long-awaited visit by General Michael Rose, 
commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, to Gorazde 
yesterday lasted only 20 minutes. During that extremely short 
time General Rose spoke with (Ferid Buljubasic), commander of 
the Eastern Bosnia Operative Group of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army in Gorazde. The issues touched upon in this blitz 
conversation were the cooperation of the military authorities in 
Gorazde with the units of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], 
and the problems connected with the implementation of the UN 
Security Council Resolution 913. 
  The general returned to Sarajevo with his associates, while 
the people of Gorazde remain in the same situation as prior to 
his visit. The aggressor's soldiers, dressed in uniforms of 
so-called Serbian police, yesterday afternoon inflicted severe 
wounds on a 10-year-old boy in the city district of Bare with a 
M-84 machine gun. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by the Information Service of the 107th Chivalrous </F>
Motorized Gradacac Brigade] 
  [Text] This morning goes to prove the well-known fact that 
the relative quiet in Gradacac is a delusion, as the aggressor 
can turn this front quickly and suddenly into a scene of total 
war. Gradacac and the surrounding area have been vibrating to 
the thunder of heavy shells exploding since 0530 this morning. 
The enemy launched this extremely powerful artillery attack 
from Gornje Krecane with three tanks, 82-mm and 120-mm mortars, 
recoilless guns, and all kinds of antiaircraft weapons. At the 
time of this report, over 500 shells have already landed on the 
defense lines in Novalici, (Osmanovici), and Vida. Over 50 have 
been directed at the town center. 
  This situation reminds us of the time of July 1992. Gradacac 
is experiencing true hell. This is the worst morning of the war 
this year. 
  At about 0800 the chetniks launched an infantry attack at 
the 
area of (Osmanovici), but it was successfully repelled. [words 
indistinct] Jasenica, and Rajska also came under a very heavy 
artillery, infantry, and armored attack early this morning. As 
we report, the situation on the front is deteriorating further 
and the attacks seem to be intensifying. The aggressor is 
firing howitzers at the town center. But despite everything the 
defense lines are firm and stable.

  [Text] According to the latest information from the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Electricity Board, the technical conditions 
have been created for the eastern part of Mostar to receive one 
megawatt of electricity. This amount is sufficient for priority 
consumers, and there will also be some distributed to the 
general public, insofar as this can be done through the very 
badly damaged distribution network. Repairs are under way on 
two more facilities to provide Mostar with electricity. At the 
same time work is under way on repairing the street lights and 
the first light bulb has already started to illuminate Mostar.

  [Text] Today, by 1100, a general danger alarm had been 
sounded three times in Doboj as Muslim [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army] 
artillery constantly shelled the city center from the direction 
of Tesanj. The fiercest Muslim attacks in the last few months 
started shortly after 0800 this morning. They were stepped up 
at 0900, and after a brief break, resumed at 1030. More than 10 
tank and mortar shells landed on and around the city center area 
during this period. According to first reports, the material 
damage is considerable. There are no reports on possible 
casualties yet, although ambulances are to be heard in the town. 
Owing to the artillery attacks on the town yesterday and today, 
schools, shops, businesses, and other public institutions are 
not functioning in Doboj. Only the hospital, the police, and 
the civil defense are working. This has been a report by our 
correspondent Brane Bozic.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 27 May (TANJUG) -- The Muslim side has 
not allowed a representative of the republic of Srpska army to 
take part in the inspection of cargo at Tuzla's Dubrave airport. 
The cargo is for UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] units and 
reportedly it also contains humanitarian aid for the Muslim 
side, it was learned today in circles of the republic of Srpska 
army. 
  It has been agreed with UNPROFOR's mediation that one 
representative of the republic of Srpska army will inspect every 
plane cargo. However, since the agreement was cancelled, cargo 
has continued to arrive by planes with no control. No one has 
said anything about what will happen to the agreement. This 
example shows how much the Muslims care to substantiate the 
assurances that no military equipment is being shipped to Tuzla 
airport, that is, how much goodwill there is to take part in 
peace processes, the republic of Srpska army circles say.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Petric: "Tuta and Djapic Are Threatening"] </F>
  [Text] The people around Tuta Naletilic have taken the law 
into their own hands. They demonstrated on Djapic what they have 
been doing for a long time throughout Siroki Brijeg--violence. 
They are collecting taxes from businessmen, dealing in drugs and 
weapons, and stealing and reselling automobiles. 
  Spokesman Ante Djapic and the rest of the leadership of the 
Croatian Rights Party [HSP], who were beaten up before the 
beginning of the HSP forum in Siroki Brijeg, according to 
witnesses' statements, still fared well. Specifically, just when 
the forum was supposed to start in a Siroki Brijeg hotel, from 
among about 100 curious people who had come to that party's 
meeting, which was expected to be like any other, a group of 
about 20 young men came out of the audience and assaulted the 
HSP members, almost beating them to death with tables, chairs, 
hammers, and sticks. When the uproar and the brawl began most of 
those present, seeing what was going on, simply fled from the 
hotel and did not appear in the city again throughout the entire 
evening. 
  Nor did they appear even on later evenings after that event 
in the cafes and restaurants of Siroki Brijeg, which were 
otherwise open until late at night (after midnight) because of 
the pleasant weather; instead, patrons slowly begin to disperse 
as early as twilight. At 2200 the patrons can already be counted 
on one's fingers, and half an hour later there is no longer 
anyone either in the cafes or on the streets. Fear has seized 
Siroki Brijeg, but if you ask someone what really happened -- a 
lot of people see it happen -- you will get silence. The 
situation is reminiscent of the atmosphere that prevailed in 
Sicily before the Italian Government decided to settle accounts 
openly with the Mafia. 
<H5>  It Started With Kraljevic </H5>
  The event in the Siroki Brijeg hotel also has its 
prehistory, 
however. It was drawn out for a long time in the media, but it 
started with the arrival of Djapic in Herzegovina after the 
murder of Blazo Kraljevic, a general in the HOS [Croatian 
Defense Forces], and another eight members of his escort. At 
that time it was officially announced that someone from 
Kraljevic's escort had been the first to open fire against 
special forces at a checkpoint in Krusevo, close to Mostar, and 
then all nine HOS members and one of the HVO [Croatian Defense 
Council] special forces members died in the shooting. In the 
media, and several times in the Assembly, Djapic publicly 
(without names, admittedly) called upon the legal system of 
Herceg-Bosna, but also Croatia, to bring those who had committed 
the murder to justice. 
  Furthermore, he constantly linked the murder of HSP leader 
Ante Paradzik (killed at a similar checkpoint in Sesvete) and 
the murder of Blazo Kraljevic and the eight HOS members, also 
saying that someone "powerful" in the Croatian Defense Ministry 
was behind it all. He threatened several times that he would 
publish the names of those who had committed the murder in 
Krusevo near Mostar. Since that threat mainly applied to Tuta 
Naletilic and the members of his battalion, Tuta, upon Djapic's 
arrival in Herzegovina, responded by threatening him not to 
appear in Siroki Brijeg, according to Djapic. 
  Djapic did not pay attention, and his two forums in Grude 
and 
Tomislavgrad were relatively well-attended (Djapic's HSP does 
not enjoy a high reputation in Herzegovina, he believes) and 
peaceful, with only tense speakers, which is also usual for 
other parties. Djapic and his escort also appeared at the Siroki 
Brijeg hotel. Tuta apparently kept his promise, and so in just a 
few minutes his people, rushing out of the audience, created 
scenes that revolted those who witnessed them. They say that it 
was like detective movies. About 20 thugs simply began to beat 
the people sitting at the table with everything at hand (and the 
clubs that they brought with them), hitting all parts of their 
bodies, heads, legs, and backs. Those who fell immediately, 
bloodied, received a few more blows, and the rest screamed and 
called for help. No one came to their assistance, however, 
because it is known in Siroki Brijeg that anyone who opposes 
Tuta's group is risking his life. 
<H5>  Minister Also Beaten Up </H5>
  On the morning of the next day, in front of the same hotel, 
Herceg-Bosna defense minister Vlado Soljic, himself a resident 
of Siroki Brijeg, was also beaten up. Some people say that he 
was struck quite accidentally, because he was passing close to 
the uproar, which had continued since the previous evening. This 
was all followed by a communique from the Herceg-Bosna Defense 
Ministry's Political Administration, which turned things around: 
Djapic and his companions were accused of wanting to start new 
conflicts between Croats and Muslims and prevent implementation 
of the Washington agreement. The kind of communique involved is 
sufficiently indicated by the fact that not a single Muslim has 
ever lived in Siroki Brijeg, either before this war or after 
World War II, so it is quite unclear how Djapic could have done 
anything like that. 
  It is clear, however, to both Herceg-Bosna Defense Minister 
Soljic and the Political Administration and to the residents of 
Herzegovina, especially the residents of Siroki Brijeg, what is 
going on. The group that has gathered around an individual 
identified as a criminal by German authorities (Tuta Naletilic) 
has taken justice and the law into its own hands. It was not 
only the one that carried out the order to execute Blazo 
Kraljevic and his escort; the group also recently started a war 
between the Siroki Brijeg and Ljubuska municipalities by 
kidnapping from the police a soldier who had previously killed a 
member of Tuta's group in a mutual clash, destroying the 
Ljubuska, Citluk, and Mostar prison in the process, and, after 
torturing him in ways that are not appropriate to describe, blew 
him up with dynamite. 
  Now they have demonstrated with Djapic what they have been 
doing for a long time now around Siroki Brijeg and other 
Herzegovina municipalities where they dare to go--violence. They 
collect taxes from private entrepreneurs, deal in drugs and 
weapons, and steal cars, change the documentation, and resell 
them. Everything good that this unit did in defending Croatian 
territory from the aggressor has been canceled out by these 
outbreaks of violence and lawlessness in Siroki Brijeg. 
<H5>  Shame Because of Crime </H5>
  General Roso himself also faced elimination several times. 
His life is guarded by his battalion; otherwise the 
assassination attempts, such as the ones that occured when he 
decided that, with the new HVO structure, private armies would 
be destroyed, would be repeated. Roso disbanded Tuta's unit, but 
its remnants are still active--Djapic is right about 
that--probably under the protection of some "more powerful" 
individual in Zagreb. 
  The story of Herzegovina lawlessness ends here, and the 
shame 
of people born in western Herzegovina because of what has 
happened begins. Until now it had never happened before, even in 
remote history, that Herzegovinians have been ashamed precisely 
because of such events and because of the authorities that are 
either tolerating or are impotent to eliminate those groups. The 
team that, by tolerating crime and gangs of thieves like that, 
has turned Herzegovina into a primitive province and has reduced 
people who previously earned an honest living to poverty or 
turned them to smuggling and fraud, is responsible for 
everything that is happening. 
  As far as Djapic is concerned, his visit to Herzegovina is 
perhaps one more attempt at political provocation, which the HSP 
has been fostering so carefully since the beginning of the war 
in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the creation of 
parallel armies and violent terrorist incursions into the 
building on Starcevic Square in Zagreb to accusations to the 
international public that the Croatian authorities are allegedly 
threatening human rights. In that context the visit to 
Herzegovina also served Djapic for one more attack against the 
Croatian leadership. On the other hand, it is good that it 
happened to a political figure, because it will arouse the media 
and possibly force people from Herzegovina to put an end to 
those who, by encouraging lawlessness, are persistently 
weakening the defense of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is as 
if the same adviser simultaneously sent Djapic to Herzegovina 
and ordered Tuta's "ex-cons."

  [Text] Vienna, May 26, IRNA -- Iran's ambassador to 
Croatia, Mohammad Javad Asayesh, held talks Thursday in the 
Croatian capital, Zagreb, with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica 
Valentic, on trilateral Iran-Bosnia-Croatia relations, as well 
as the Tehran economic agreement reached between the three 
parties. The two sides expressing their satisfaction with the 
confederation agreement between the Croats and Muslims said that 
they would concentrate their efforts aimed at strengthening the 
agreement. 
  Valentic thanking Iran for its assistance, said the 
Croat-Muslim confederation has paved the way for trilateral 
economic cooperation. Asayesh, voicing support for trilateral 
economic collaboration, also stressed Tehran's readiness for 
expansion of relations. Following Valentic's recent visit to 
Tehran, Iran is to purchase four cargo ships from Croatia. The 
trade volume between the two countries amounted to around dlrs 
30 million in 1993.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 26 (TANJUG) -- Diplomatic sources in 
Belgrade on Thursday said the possibility of lifting U.N. 
sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) voiced by 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and a statement by the 
Security Council president calling on Bosnia's three warring 
sides to cease hostilities were positive developments in the 
quest for a settlement of the Bosnian crisis. The same sources 
believe the positive developments were triggered by the meeting 
of the U.S., Russian and E.U. foreign ministers and U.N. 
representatives in Geneva on May 13. 
  The participants in the meeting called on the warring sides 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina to cease all hostilities and urged a 
negotiated settlement of the Bosnian war and gradual lifting of 
the sanctions against Yugoslavia imposed in late May of 1992. 
The latest statement by the Security Council president for the 
first time makes no reference to the Bosnian Serbs alone, but 
treats all warring sides equally, diplomats in Belgrade said. 
Furthermore, Butrus-Ghali made the first explicit reference to 
the lifting of the anti-Yugoslav sanctions, without making it 
conditional on a final and lasting settlement of the Bosnian 
crisis, they added. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement that Washington's 
unilateral exemption of Bosnian Muslims from a U.N. embargo on 
arms deliveries to all of former Yugoslavia would kill the peace 
process fits perfectly into the latest positive developments. 
Bearing all that in mind, the impression is that some changes 
have nevertheless been made in the international community 
regarding its stands on the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
This is especially true of Europe, which is obviously in a 
hurry to close the `Bosnian file' before the infinitely more 
dangerous `Crimean file' has been opened. 
  The positive developments would first be tested in the 
French 
town of Talloires, where the international `contact group' for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on Thursday started a second round of talks 
with the Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats. There are some 
indications that the talks are progressing fine, which has also 
been confirmed by Speaker of the Bosnian Serb parliament Momcilo 
Krajisnik. There are also indications that Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats are willing to accept an internationally-brokered plan 
according to which they would get 51 per cent and the republic 
of Srpska 49 per cent of Bosnia's territory. 
  The Muslim and Croat representatives first demanded 58 per 
cent of the territory for their binational federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Article by Ali H. Zerdin: "`Slovenes' From Singapore"] </F>
  [Editorial Report] The 3 May issue of the Ljubljana weekly 
MLADINA publishes a report detailing attempts by the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia military to circumvent the UN-imposed 
arms embargo and economic sanctions. According to the report, 
the Federal Directorate of Supply and Procurement [FDSP], the 
only Yugoslav Government agency authorized to trade in weapons, 
set up a subsidiary, FDSP (Asia) PTE Ltd., in Singapore in June 
1991 and established "successful trade relations" with the 
Burmese Government, to which it reportedly sold several Galeb 
aircraft. 
  Lim Poh Weng, a Singapore citizen, is the largest investor 
in 
and director of the FSDP Singapore subsidiary, MLADINA states, 
with Yugoslavs Borislav Jurisic, Nikodin Jovanovic, Caslav 
Jovanovic, and Mustafa Smailovic serving as executive directors. 
With the exception of Jurisic, the Yugoslavs listed their 
permanent address as 9 Nemanjina, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, which is 
the address of the Federal Directorate of Supply and 
Procurement. Citing a report in the December 1989 issue of the 
Belgrade military journal NARODNA ARMIJA, MLADINA says that 
Nikodin Jovanovic attained the rank of lieutenant colonel 
general in the Yugoslav People's Army. 
  MLADINA states that following the imposition of the UN arms 
embargo and economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, FDSP (Asia) 
PTE Ltd. changed its name to Deuteron PTE Ltd. and increased its 
capital to 200,000 Singapore dollars. Director Lim Poh Weng's 
share of the investment was 102,000, and the Yugoslav parent 
company contributed 98,000 Singapore dollars. The firm's 
registration number remained unchanged. The Yugoslav parent 
company, however, is now listed as a Slovene enterprise 
headquartered at the old Belgrade address. The Yugoslav 
business partners have also reregistered as Slovene citizens, 
although they still use the same Yugoslav passports and 
permanent address in Belgrade. They have dropped Mustafa 
Smailovic, a Muslim, from their staff and added a new "Slovene" 
member -- Jovan Cekovic. MLADINA notes that it had checked the 
records in Ljubljana and found that none of the business 
partners has Slovene citizenship.

  [Text] Governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia 
Dragoslav Avramovic has held talks with the businessmen and 
trade union leaders of the Rakovica commune. Concluding that 
production could be increased on the basis of consumer loans, 
he, at the same time, announced their introduction. Dragoslav 
Avramovic stressed that it is encouraging that we have noted a 
drop in unemployment for the first time since the outbreak of 
the war on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. He added 
that the policy of the National Bank of Yugoslavia is determined 
by the fact that more than half of the capacities in the economy 
are unexploited, while the reserves in the labor force are also 
great. Dragoslav Avramovic is of the opinion that company 
profits should be taxed and not salaries.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 26 -- The Yugoslav Army has 
successfully completed the first stage of its transformation, 
says Deputy Chief of Staff General Ratomir Milovanovic. Taking 
part in a panel discussion on the Yugoslav Army's public image, 
General Milovanovic said that the army had preserved its unity, 
maintained the necessary level of combat preparedness, 
consolidated its ranks and dismantled the territorial defense 
force. He explained that the process of consolidating and 
transforming the army had been embarked upon despite a 
exceptionally unfavourable situations in the world and the 
country's immediate neighbourhood, and an adverse legacy left 
behind by the old federation. 
  The chain of command has been streamlined and the efficacy 
of 
the command and logistic apparatus enhanced, he said. The chief 
of the information department of the army's General Staff, 
Colonel Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, who spoke about the new identity 
and public image of the Yugoslav Army, said that the new image 
had been conceived as far back as 1992 and that it envisaged for 
a new professional organization, equipped with sophisticated 
equipment, non-political in character and based on the glorious 
militayy traditions of the Serbian and Montenegrin people. 
  The assistant defense minister for the military industry, 
General Savo Pustinja, said ttat the Yugoslav military industry 
had oastered the technology for the production of more than 400 
weapons systems, 30 percent of which had been exported before 
the United Nations clamped sanctions on Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) in 1992. The sanctions were imposed because 
of Yugoslavia's alleged involvement in civil war raging in 
neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina and their lifting is being made 
conditional on an end to the war. 
  The Yugoslav Army will have changed the insignia on the 
uniforms by Army day, June 16, which will be observed for the 
first time this year.

<F P=106> [By Djordje Milosevic] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, May 26 (TANJUG) -- The Moscow pro-government 
paper IZVESTIYA has recently showed that the principle `innocent 
until proven guilty' does not apply to the Serbs which it holds 
responsible for the murder of Russian reporters Viktor Nogin and 
Gennadiy Kurenoy, reported missing near Kostajnica in the 
Republic of Serb Krajina on September 1, 1991. 
  IZVESTIYA's reporter Vladimir Mukusev, member of the special 
parliamentary commission set up to inquire the case, quotes a 
testimony by `star witness' Stevo Borojevic as saying that the 
two reporters were ambushed on the Bosnia-Croatia border and 
later executed by one Ranko Borojevic on charges of spying for 
Croatia. The Serbs were thus found guilty of murder of the two 
reporters on the basis of a single testimony and without any 
conclusive evidence. 
  IZVESTIYA's reporting has been strongly criticized by 
Vladimir Solovev of the Russian Ostankino television who was 
also on the investigative team. Solovev said in an interview to 
the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA paper that Mukusev's statements cannot 
be independently verified. In a series of articles on the 
situation in former Yugoslavia, IZVESTIYA has always referred to 
the Serbs as the sole culprits for everything that has gone 
wrong. 
  The way the paper has presented speculations as solid facts 
and the timing of the story only testify to malevolence and an 
unhidden desire to harm the Serbs. By portraying the Serbs as 
the arch villains, the paper is actually trying to persuade the 
Russian public that the Serbs started the war in former 
Yugoslavia. All this is aimed into justifying Russia's position 
on anti-Yugoslav sanctions, support for a series of inconsistent 
solutions detrimental to the Serbs and lack of reaction to 
another Moslem-Croat onslaught in Bosnia. 
  IZVESTIYA believes the Russian public should be constantly 
reminded of the Serb guilt to minimize criticism of Moscow's 
erroneous policy towards developments in former Yugoslavia, its 
biasness, double standards and what some analysts describe as 
total subordination to the west.

  [Text] The Hungarians of Vojvodina are not satisfied with 
the stability process. Szilveszter Varga reports: 
  [Varga] The drafts coming before the Paris stability 
conference do not meet the demands and the situation of the 
Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK], Andras 
Agoston [VMDK chairman] said in his interview to Hungarian 
Radio. The VMDK chairman added that the other minorities 
probably have a similar standpoint. Asked what chances there 
are for dialogue between Hungary and Yugoslavia, in harmony with 
the assumption of bilateral relations -- which is being urged by 
the French -- Agoston said the following: 
  [Begin Agoston recording] In view of the fact that the text 
itself, which is now on the agenda, says that those who want to 
enter Europe must sign this stability agreement, I hope that the 
taking up of Hungarian-Serb relations will be possible in this 
matter as well. A Hungarian-Serb dialogue could evolve between 
the countries as well. 
  At the same time, I consider it important to stress here too 
that we should take part with an appropriate role in this 
dialogue, since in the course of the discussions it is us that 
they will be talking about. I think that in the coming period 
this taking up of contacts, of dialogue, will get under way, 
both between the Hungarian community and the Serb -- or Yugoslav 
-- government, and between the two governments. [end recording] 
  [Varga] In answer to the same question, Momcilo Grubac, 
former minister of minority and human rights of the Panic 
government, replied that discussions between neighboring 
countries, where bilateral agreements should also be concluded, 
are useful, but that much more important is the internal 
political aspect of this issue, in other words, whether dialogue 
evolves between the powers that be and the minorities, because 
it depends on this dialogue how great will be the harmony 
between the neighboring countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wieslaw Kaczmarek, Polish minister for </F>
ownership transformations, by unidentified announcer; place and 
date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] By the end of 1998, there will be no 
state enterprises left in Poland. That is the barest possible 
summary of the consequences of the commercialization program of 
state enterprises that has been adopted by the government. The 
most important thing in this is, however, the fact that there 
has been sketched out therein an intended model for the shape of 
the Polish economy. 
  [Kaczmarek] The commercialization program is not, certainly, 
a conservation of the present arrangement. It is to be a program 
that will change the Polish economy. The commercialization 
program is, really, to consist of a number of drafts, of 
successive programs. The first will be based upon us wishing to 
transform the best, good, and large enterprises into the modern 
formula of companies with capital. Commercialization will 
reduce to the fact they will function upon the basis of the 
principles of the Commercial Code. Later they will be subject, 
successively, to privatization. 
  The second program will allow us to separate out from the 
group of 5,300 state enterprises still extant, the enterprises 
that are the weakest. This is served by a new formula proposed 
in the Law on State Enterprise, which will allow for a very, to 
put it rather unpleasantly, aggressive repair of these 
enterprises through the application of bank reconciliation 
procedures, agreed procedures, well, unfortunately bankruptcy 
procedures also, or else special programs prepared at the 
ministry, such as the stabilization-privatization-restructuring 
program. Everything that will serve to repair the enterprises. 
  The third program associated with commercialization will be 
a 
program--for we then have the small- and medium-sized 
enterprises still left over, and we intend to quickly and 
efficiently sell those enterprises [as heard]. The fourth 
component, this is a program that I will call the improvement in 
the condition of the state public finances and so the 
exploitation of state enterprises, thus earlier formed for the 
purposes of the creation of pension funds, a health insurance 
fund. Then this--when one looks at commercialization in such a 
context--can be seen that quite simply this is a quite 
considerable operation that is to run its course until the end 
of next year, and is later then still to fulfill one fundamental 
function. 
  [Announcer] The point at hand is that the commercialization 
program of state enterprises will be fulfilled through the, by 
many long expected, Law on the State Treasury. 
  [Kaczmarek] That which we have proposed and which we passed 
to the prime minister on Tuesday is the law on the management of 
the state treasury assets. For this purpose we will create 
special capital agencies. This will constitute a kind of 
identification of the owner, which will allow us to depart from 
the sectoral model of economy management, and for the ministry 
to fulfill regulative and administrative functions, but not 
ownership functions. The commercialization program is, in a 
word, I would say, this clearing of the ground for realistic, 
further ownership transformations, among which I would include 
privatization, restructuring, and the various paths to 
privatization, because we wish to maintain these different 
privatization paths. Quite simply, we must make up for a 
certain amount of lost time. 
  [Announcer] The transformation of state enterprises into 
single entity state treasury companies functioning on the basis 
of the Commercial Code must undoubtedly place into question the 
model of management of these enterprises hitherto. 
  [Kaczmarek] There are two factors here. Well, by the very 
nature of things the law that speaks of the principles of 
management of the finances of state enterprises falls by the 
wayside. We are moving away from the philosophy of the popiwek 
[the law on taxation of over the norm increases in 
remuneration], we are moving away from the philosophy of the 
compulsory dividend that was calculated upon the basis of book 
balance sheets, in favor of the solutions that are in force in 
the Commercial Code. We are changing the method of management 
of enterprises in favor of a stronger position for the manager, 
through the company board, and also through the body supervising 
the functioning of this company in the name of the State 
Treasury--this is the Supervisory Board. Well, we will as I say 
through the Law on the State Treasury seek to identify the owner 
in the form of the capital agencies. We are moving away from 
this sectoral model of the economy, and so I affirm that from 
the viewpoint of the enterprise, this will be an entity that 
will have precisely the opportunity to act on commercial 
principles, on the basis of the Commercial Code principles. 
  This is very important from the viewpoint of the 
identification of such an enterprise by a possible investor from 
outside. For, please believe me, he comes to Poland, and I have 
met him several times [laughs], and says that he cannot 
understand institutions such as the state enterprise on the 
basis of the laws of 1981. If there are such people who say 
that somewhere in the West there are state firms--then they have 
precisely the form of capital-based companies, and so they are 
based upon the principles of the Commercial Code [as heard]. We 
should be moving in that direction. 
  [Announcer] The adoption of the commercialization program of 
state enterprises will cause the minister for ownership 
transformations to gain in significance. Is this the end of the 
recently continuing dispute between the heads of the economic 
ministries over the form of privatization? 
  [Kaczmarek] Conflicts do not in fact exist. They are 
disputes of a certain kind. On the other hand, but, I think 
that they are disputes that are capable of being overcome. I 
would not wish to argue at all over the so-called rights of the 
owner, but rather over the concept for restructuring, over the 
programs for these firms. On the other hand, this program has 
one more characteristic that is worth mentioning here. It is 
precisely moving away from what the present coalition is often 
accused of at the moment, that it has a tendency toward the 
centralization of power. This program assumes in its philosophy 
precisely a decentralization of power, the lowering of these 
agencies to the level of the Polish macro-regions. Thus, the 
non-engagement of the central administrative offices in the 
administration of enterprises. Above all, they will be regional 
structures.

  [Text] The Sejm adopted today a government report on the 
second stage of restructuring the hard coal mining industry (in 
1994-95), presented yesterday by Industry and Trade Minister 
Marek Pol. 
  The main goal of this stage of restructuring, according to 
the minister, is to achieve profitability by coal companies and 
to maintain it, to ensure competitiveness of Polish coal on 
foreign markets, to clear the mining industry's debts, to make 
funds for the modernization of collieries available, and to 
create conditions for pay rises to miners, thus reducing their 
uncertainty about job security. All this is to serve a supreme 
goal -- the achievement of effectiveness and stability in the 
hard coal mining industry. 
  There were 242 votes for adopting the report, 27 against, 
and 
53 abstentions.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 26 -- The cabinet Socio-Political 
Committee (KSPRM) decided Thursday that settlements of the 
trilateral commission for socio-economic issues would receive a 
fast legislative track treatment as matters of priority. 
Thursday's KSPRM meeting discussed the outcome of negotiations 
conducted within the trilateral commission and in six teams 
which are working out an agreement on social guarantees. 
  The committees secretary Grzegorz Rydlewski told journalists 
after the meeting that similar treatment would be given to 
questions ensuing from government-trade unions negotiations on 
social guarantees. 
  Head of the trilateral commission, Deputy Labour Minister 
Andrzej Baczkowski emphasized that the commission is not only a 
negotiating but also decision making organ. He also stressed 
that the commission examines all pressing demands put forward by 
the solidarity trade union which does not mean, however, that 
all of them would be satisfied. 
  Baczkowski confirmed that the government would not carry out 
bilateral negotiations with solidarity terming that form of 
talks as anachronistic. 
  Rydlewski added that the trilateral commission, grouping 
representatives of the government, trade unions and employers 
organizations, was a good instrument for solving unions demands. 
The next meeting of the trilateral commission will be held on 
June 6.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcin Krol, Warsaw University Professor, </F>
historian of ideas, editor in chief of NOWA RESPUBLICA, and 
columnist for TYGODNIK POWSZECHNY: "Coalition of Fear -- True 
End of Worker-Peasant Alliance"] 
  [Text] In Great Britain a speaker's accent attracts 
considerable attention. Persons from lower social classes who 
have attained high social advancement try to speak with an 
Oxford accent proper for the higher classes. But when such a 
politician or businessman gets tense, he tends to speak with his 
childhood accent, such as a Liverpool one. Well, it is a similar 
thing with the Polish politicians who belong to the governing 
coalition. They try mightily to obliterate their PRL [Polish 
People's Republic] origin and sometimes they succeed, but when 
they become nervous the Liverpool in them emerges. 
  During the recent strikes, Deputy Prime Minister Cimoszewicz 
said that there will be no negotiations so long as the strikes 
continue, that is, under the strike gun, while Prime Minister 
Pawlak said that on the day of the great strike a lot of good 
happened because many people kept on working. Such comments are 
ludicrous, because, of course, the negotiations did go on during 
the strike and even succeeded. The fact that a person works is 
something normal rather than good. But such reversion to 
Liverpool language is typical; it demonstrates not so much the 
difficulty of getting rid of the burden of the past (which is 
hardly surprising) as that the more difficult it is to get rid 
of that burden the less substantive a comment can be and hence 
also the less can be accomplished. And it is my belief that the 
new-old coalition has nothing to say and can accomplish nothing. 
  It began its governance with empty rhetoric and lies. For 
such were the elements of the prime minister's opening address 
to the Sejm, which focused a lot on the evil doings of his 
predecessors and on making many promises, in particular to the 
world of science, education, culture, and health. It is not 
enough that since then nothing has been accomplished in those 
domains; on the contrary, they even regressed in terms of both 
budgetary allocations and restructuring. More even, at the 
Ministry for National Education for the time being only numerous 
personnel changes have been made, and at the Ministry of Culture 
"Liverpool" reached its apogee, as best exemplified by the 
affair of the letter of Krzysztof Teodor Toeplitz. We also were 
lied to when they promised us a mysterious budget extending the 
social safety net; afterward Deputy Prime Minister Borowski was 
fired and the budget remained unchanged. Mendacity and blather 
are, besides, triumphant in practically every domain of public 
life and at every post. This is best exemplified by the 
unbelievably tangled affair of the "popiwek" [tax on wage 
increases], in which mendacity became an instrument employed not 
so much owing to lack of an opinion of one's own but 
deliberately and purposely. 
<H5>  The Unsuccessful Return </H5>
  I am no Cato and know well that politicians lie all over the 
world, but there exist varieties of the political lie and turgid 
rhetoric is not so horrible when it substitutes for real 
political action and merely serves to satisfy the public demand 
for high-sounding phrases. But the politicians of the governing 
coalition lie, prattle, and do nothing. It is interesting that 
some of them, whether presumably or certainly more prominent, 
have lately clammed up. It appears they already know so much 
that they are not certain about anything. 
  How did it happen? Why did the "worker-peasant alliance" 
[Alliance of the Democratic Left and the Polish Peasant Party] 
so soon reveal its hopeless fecklessness? Why is it even now 
clear that the return is a resounding failure, that presumably 
this governing coalition will remain in power for some time yet 
but it will doubtless be its swan song? 
  It already common knowledge that this coalition won the 
elections by making promises it could not keep. But it is not as 
clear why it could not afterward, after taking power, formulate 
a clear program of action that would at least to some extent 
envisage fulfillment of pre-electoral promises. Well, I think 
that by now it is obvious why it did not happen. That coalition 
is a coalition of fear. From the very outset the factor keeping 
it together and determining its conduct was fear, and fear in 
several forms at that. 
  First, there is the fear of repeating the past. Thus, it 
prevented taking any explicitly socialist decisions, for which 
the representatives of the Labor Union and the OPZZ [National 
Alliance of Trade Unions] are, justly from their point of view, 
reproaching that coalition. 
  Second, there is the fear of interfering with the rather 
gratifying performance of the market economy, meaning the fear 
of forfeiting the accomplishments of the previous 
administrations, that is, the fear of deviating from the liberal 
course of the economy. Despite numerous attempts, that fear 
could not be covered up by clever social-democratic or 
peasant-populist speechifying, and it has become widely obvious. 
  Third, there is the fear of the presumed ideological 
electorate of that coalition, which directly led to strikes at 
the end of April. Thus, the first decisions of the Pawlak 
administration, made last November, were to make every 
concession to the demands of the striking miners, and it became 
obvious that with the approach of the spring there would be more 
such strikes. 
  Fourth, there is the fear of the coalition's own image, as 
clearly demonstrated by Prime Minister Pawlak when, on the very 
first occasion when something went wrong, he fired the concerned 
deputy minister (Kawalec) and recently also Deputy Minister 
Morawski, who is said to be the leading energy expert in Poland. 
  Fifth, there is the fear of the mass media, initially less 
evident within the SLD [Alliance of the Democratic Left] but by 
now obvious there too. That fear is that they have nothing to 
say and do not understand the role of the mass media and, 
basically, show no interest in winning over public opinion, 
which wears no blinkers and is not deceived. 
  Sixth, there is the fear of the president, who to be sure 
cannot, under the Constitution, wreak any real harm on the 
coalition but who serves as its only vehicle for credibility 
with the public, as could be seen from the enraptured faces of 
the SLD activists when they recently met with Walesa. 
  Seventh and last, there is the fear of the people who get 
nothing out of the coalition government, a fear that has 
prompted it to distribute more or less 20 million zlotys apiece 
to each farmer, allegedly as a loan for fertilizers, and to keep 
that decision secret so that the remaining public would not know 
what its taxes are being spent on. 
  Another factor accounting for the existence of the coalition 
is opportunism. To be sure, I do not think opportunism in public 
life to be something entirely negative. After all, opportunism 
as adaptation to circumstances which may not always be 
foreseeable is often proof of common sense. Provided, however, 
that such opportunism is accompanied by strong political 
convictions for whose sake compromises, often hardly palatable, 
are made. But the governing coalition has no such convictions, 
just as it has no program of action, and hence in its case 
opportunism is a totally negative attitude, a way of remaining 
afloat in spite of all undertows and eddies. 
  This opportunism is, to cite just a few instances, clearly 
reflected in the nearly total turnabout in the governing 
coalition's views on Poland's membership in NATO. Prior to the 
elections the SLD was in many ways critical of that idea, but 
after the elections, when it realized that the Polish public is 
remarkably united on this issue, it jettisoned all of its 
criticisms. Another example of opportunist conduct is the budget 
voted by the coalition, which basically does not embody any of 
its campaign promises. That also applies to its attitude toward 
privatization, restitution of nationalized property, and other 
economic issues. But most characteristic from that standpoint is 
the avoidance of taking a stand on any issue that might provoke 
a serious political dispute. A coalition that won the elections 
upon proclaiming its desire to combat corruption, organized 
crime, and smuggling, has done nothing at all about the issues 
and has not dared to organize any major trial. 
  Finally, the coalition's opportunism is reflected in its 
attitude toward other political parties and views. In that 
domain the governing coalition remains passive, does not try to 
prove anything, and does not show the will to demonstrate the 
justness of its (nonexistent) decisions. It simply evades any 
dispute. It also avoids, at any price, internal disputes. This 
is clearly demonstrated not only by its treatment of Deputy 
Prime Minister Borowski but also by the tacit consent of the SLD 
to the dangerous protectionist aspirations of the PSL [Polish 
Peasant Party]. The position of Prime Minister Pawlak is so 
strong for the very reason that the SLD's decision on such a 
precise structure of the government ensued from a rotten 
compromise or opportunism for which there is no longer any 
remedy. The PSL, as a supposedly Catholic party (something which 
it has never before advertised), serves as a liaison between the 
coalition and the Roman Catholic Church and thus takes care of 
the opinions of the peasants, which are anachronistic by virtue 
of their social and economic situation. But it is precisely this 
alliance with the PSL that prevents the SLD from pursuing any 
explicit policy and condemns it to failure in the struggle for a 
new shape of Polish domestic policy or, in other words, turns 
the SLD into an antimodernist force. 
<H5>  A Weak Root </H5>
  Fear and opportunism are subjective factors, which depend 
more on the leaders and members of the coalition parties than on 
the external situation. But we also are dealing with objective 
factors owing to which there is not, and shall not be, any 
longer any future for that coalition. The most important of 
those factors is deracination. 
  The unexpectedly big electoral win of the SLD and the PSL 
imbued the two parties with the belief that they have social 
support. But that belief is as illusory as were the social 
expectations that brought victory to the parties. We are 
perfectly aware that there will be no free lunch and no 
guaranteed procurement prices, and practically everybody had 
known it from the outset, but there was hope that in some 
mysterious way the new-old parties would alleviate the pain of 
the economic reforms. That did not happen because it could not 
happen. In Poland nowadays there is no social class that can 
fight for its privileges effectively and sensibly. The SLD and 
the PSL came to power with about the same attitude as that of 
the socialists of the late 19th century, that is, of an era when 
the working class had really been exploited and had something to 
fight for. Nowadays there are no such class and no justified 
partisan goals. 
  The SLD and the PSL lack a past of their own, and as for the 
communist past ascribed to them, they want to forget it at any 
price. But no kowtowing references to Witos [Wincenty Witos, the 
prewar peasant-party leader] can obscure the fact that most of 
the PSL's current leaders used to belong to the ZSL [United 
Peasant Party], just as the leaders of the SLD used to belong to 
the PZPR. However, as that past is so burdensome, with what 
origin should these parties identify themselves and what 
identity should they clothe themselves with? Without a 
principled program, without support from a nonexistent class 
society--let us bear in mind that it was precisely workers who 
did not at all vote for the SLD--without a history and language 
of its own, a party is condemned to nonexistence. That is a 
problem that has also been encountered by parties of Solidarity 
origin. So how are parties of PRL origin to build their own 
image for internal and external consumption? 
  But is that so important after all? Yes, because in the 
absence of roots surface existence is not possible. For a 
political movement, roots are what keeps it together and a means 
of internal communication and rapport with the outside world. 
Aleksander Kwasniewski lost headway after several brilliant 
speeches, because his party lacks a language whereby he could 
speak constructively about anything, and as for the linguistic 
utterances of Prime Minister Pawlak, they demonstrate that the 
PSL lacks any original concepts and approaches of its own. 
Standing on the brink of the abyss, and work ethic, and 
consider recently also that recent amazingly feckless Sejm 
speech, whose culmination was the following passage: "...I was 
raised under other circumstances and in another system of 
values. That is why accord, cooperation, mutual goodwill, and 
working together are closer to me than conflict...." The prime 
minister was probably thinking of his native rural community and 
he simply forgot that in the 1980's he used to be a member of 
the youth wing of the ZSL and that those times were hardly times 
of accord and goodwill. His desperate search for arguments led 
him to point to such roots at the expense of drastically 
deviating from the truth. It thus can be seen that the PSL under 
its present leaders can be, objectively speaking, only a peasant 
party, that this is its sole root, but it is not a root that 
qualifies it to govern the country. 
  Lastly, deracination leads to a reaction that is literally 
reactionary, meaning that it prompts searching for people from 
one's old former world and shutting oneself up in that world. 
The suspicion that the SLD and the PSL will come to rely on men 
who had played the second fiddle in the former PRL has by now 
been proven on a large scale, and that is not surprising because 
these parties can form a world of their own jointly only with 
such people, a world that is not a world of ideas, programs, or 
politics, but merely a world of sentiments and resentments. 
<H5>  Presumed Leftism </H5>
  Another objective factor ruining the chances of that 
coalition for the future is its--also objective--inability to 
build a constructive vision of itself and, as a consequence, a 
constructive vision of its own policy and of Poland. In that 
case, too, the SLD and the PSL suffer an ailment that is also 
shared by post-Solidarity groupings. But for the governing 
coalition the problem is much more difficult to resolve, because 
developing a constructive vision is difficult in the absence of 
roots, a program, social support, and internal human and 
ideological cohesiveness. That is precisely why, rather than 
owing to some special indolence, the government acts with such 
an improbable sluggishness that it can be only compared with the 
government of Jan Olszewski (with which it has many features in 
common anyhow). That also is why we so often perceive the 
absence of mutual loyalty binding members of the government, 
deputy prime ministers, and the prime minister. 
  Still, even a constructive program is not what matters most 
if current problems can be effectively and rapidly resolved. But 
the absence of either leads to a paralysis of the political 
scene, in which the president now and then quite unexpectedly 
intervenes so as to either add to the general confusion or lead 
to some unexpected decisions. From the beginning it was known 
that this government can endure on two conditions: That it shall 
fairly consistently continue the economic policy established by 
former Prime Minister Balcerowicz and that it will somehow reach 
an understanding with President Walesa. For the time being the 
governing coalition is meeting both those conditions, but that 
does not mean that it has succeeded in making a contribution of 
its own to the new reality. If anybody thinks differently, how 
about giving me just one example of a constructive action by the 
new coalition. I am not aware of any. 
  Besides, it is worth noting that this coalition came to 
power 
with the byword of "leftism." Even very serious people such as 
Stanislaw Stomma have acknowledged that the times are ripe for 
the Left, because in times of change the Left is more suitable 
than the Right, whose purpose is rather to correct excessively 
radical actions of the Left. We all for awhile let ourselves be 
bamboozled by that supposed leftism of the SLD and the PSL, 
whereas it now turns out that power was taken by an ideological 
zero. 
  What will happen next? Why do I believe that the end has 
come? For awhile we can still expect this administration to 
continue, but it does not seem likely that the present governing 
coalition will endure until the next elections. What is still 
more important, it does not seem likely that this coalition or 
its components will develop into a clear and sensible opposition 
in Poland. If some members of the former Solidarity opposition 
went rather far in flirting with the representatives of the 
current coalition, that was because they had thought that a new 
partner in political life has appeared on the scene, a partner 
with whom they would have to cohabit long and therefore it was 
better to maintain sensible contacts with the Communists rather 
than to point a finger at their past. This approach has proven 
mistaken, not only because it has caused the society to accept 
its recent enemy, but also because for awhile it afforded some 
legitimacy to the old-new coalition. But even now it can be seen 
that there is nobody to talk with (not in the sense of any 
absence of reasonable and witty individuals in the government), 
because there is nothing to talk about. If that is so while this 
coalition is in power, then it will simply evaporate once it 
becomes the opposition after losing the elections, that being 
the fate that awaits it sooner or later. Essentially, everything 
depends on whether the present-day opposition learns to create a 
workable party organization and electoral machinery and on when 
that will come true. 
  The expectation that the worker-peasant alliance will become 
a thing of the past hardly saddens me. But in the end we should 
consider the present and future consequences of this era of 
coalition government to the present and future of Poland. To the 
present, as can be seen, the consequences will be fatal, because 
the pace of the reforms will slow down, markedly, solely, and 
exclusively through the fault of the present government. As for 
the future, the consequences will depend on whether such 
political motivations as fear, opportunism, and negation as a 
principle of action, and such objective conditions as 
deracination and inability to build a constructive vision of 
Poland will become a permanent feature of Polish life. For it 
may happen that the coalition not only will itself become a 
loser, but also will drag down with it the entire Polish 
political scene. It may thus happen that a rebirth can be 
expected only after yet another revolution and that only then 
will virtue and courage resume their proper place in public 
life. I do not know whether this is an expression of hope or 
horror, but I know for certain that those who, though aware of 
the burden of the past resting on them, have nevertheless taken 
power, now find themselves in a much worse situation than 
formerly. Formerly they could argue that they had been unable to 
accomplish much under the PRL, but now they can only acknowledge 
that they can do nothing. As for us, we unfortunately have to 
endure all this somehow.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: Regular Shift at Border Watchtowers"] </F>
  [Text] There is no place for distress after the rumors of 
the alleged concentration of military forces from the Serbian 
side on the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM]-Serbian border, the competent Macedonian 
sources quoted by Makpres claim. 
  After warnings by the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] units 
stationed in the Republic of Macedonia, that an increased 
movement of military units is noticed on the other side of the 
Macedonian-Serbian border, the sources, which asked to remain 
anonymous, said that the fact of the matter is a regular filling 
of the border watchtowers with additional reserve soldiers. 
According to the new organization of the military in rump 
Yugoslavia, which now massively and actively includes reserve 
officers, the border units are made up of regular and reserve 
soldiers. 
  "The increased movement of soldiers along the border objects 
is owed to the regular replacement of the reserve soldiers," the 
sources claim, adding that "it is in no way a case of some 
unusual concentration of armed forces due to military exercises 
or maneuvers."

  [Text] Skopje, 26 May (TANJUG) -- The Executive Council of 
the Party of Democratic Action [SDA--Stranka Demokratske Akcije] 
in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM], also referred to here as "the imported party" or 
"Izetbegovic's party," issued a statement expressing its 
indignation at Stojan Andov, the president of the Macedonian 
parliament. The statement says that Andov "is deliberately 
trying to deny the existence of a considerable group of citizens 
who nationally consider themselves Muslim." The SDA has not 
been invited to take part in the talks that members of the 
commission of the European Council's parliamentary assembly, who 
are not Council members, [as received], held with members of 
ethnic groups in Macedonia in Ohrid on 24 May. 
  It has been noted several times over the past two or three 
years in Skopje that the SDA has been trying to turn the Islamic 
population originally from Serbia, Montenegro, and former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina--who arrived in Macedonia in the 1950's to 
facilitate their emigration to Turkey, but have remained in 
Macedonia because the Turks suspended immigration--into a new 
national community in Macedonia. 
  Some Macedonian parties and associations believe that the 
SDA 
has recently been trying to turn these Muslim people in 
Macedonia--with Serbian as their mother tongue--into some kind 
of a "Bosniak" nationality. Observers in Skopje believe that 
attempts to affirm the alleged existence of "Bosniaks" are part 
of the Islamic fundamentalism strategy in the Balkans and 
elsewhere. Journalists in Skopje noted that during his visit to 
Skopje in mid-May, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Murat 
Karayalcin spoke, and certainly not by accident, about the 
Muslims in former Bosnia-Herzegovina--who speak the Serbian 
language--as "Bosniaks." Commenting recently on the 
increasingly frequent insistence that some kind of a "Bosniak 
culture" exists in Macedonia, Ljubisa Georgijevski, the 
president of the Forum for the Freedom of Media in Macedonia, 
said in a TV program that neither "Bosniaks" nor "the Bosniak 
language" exist.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by </F>
correspondent Ivan Samel on 26 May; place not given -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Samel] Mr. Minister, what steps will be 
followed after the submission to NATO yesterday of the Slovak 
document on the Partnership for Peace program, both on 
Slovakia's and on NATO's part? 
  [Kanis] By presenting the document we have begun to 
institutionalize the process of implemenating the Partnership 
for Peace program. Relevant organizational structures will be 
created that will be involved in a specific program of joint 
actions, as expressed in the individual program. In this way, 
the basic prerequisites will be created for tackling the 
questions of Slovak security. A special NATO group will soon 
come to Bratislava to begin, along with our military and 
security specialists, to examine the content of the document we 
have presented to NATO, above all the proposals we have included 
in it which express our capabilities and resources which we will 
provide in the implementation of the document presented in 
Brussels. They will begin to confront the document with 
reality, with what Slovakia is capable of doing. Up to now, we 
have received offers for joint exercises from the Netherlands 
and Norway, and during a dinner the Romanian defense minister 
also proposed that we carry out such a joint exercise at which a 
military unit from a NATO member country would participate. 
  We are a small state wrestling with a number of problems and 
cannot efford to make mistakes in the procedure. We will 
carefully weigh up the whole situation which arises from the 
presentation document and create certain model situations. As 
soon as possible, we would like to prepare all the defense 
personnel who are going to share in the implementation of the 
presentation document to a degree which enables us to be 
perfectly prepared to cope when we take part in joint actions. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Samel] Unquestionably, the Russian Federation has a 
specific 
position in NATO's eyes. Can an individual treaty between NATO 
and Russia influence the form of the individual treaty concluded 
between Slovakia and NATO? 
  [Kanis] I believe that the course of NATO has shown that 
apparently no country has the chance of gaining any other status 
with regard to the partnership for Peace Program. Naturally, 
the Russian Federation is a great Euro-Asian power, and because 
of this it will apparently cooperate in a different manner. I 
would not exclude the possibility of certain problems being 
tackled through bilateral U.S.-Russian relations, outside the 
Partnership for Peace Program. My understanding of the 
situation is that within the Partnership for Peace program the 
Russian Federation will be in an equal position. This does not 
mean that some other, additional provisions will not be 
included, wither at the bilateral level or at the level of 
cooperation with NATO. 
  [Samel] Can a situation arise under which Slovakia would be 
compelled under certain circumstances, such as a treaty between 
Russia and the United States, to leave the Partnership for Peace 
program? 
  [Kanis] I totally exclude such a possibility. Central 
European nations and states today have an opportunity slowly to 
draw nearer to the West European and trans-Atlantic security, 
political, and economic structures. Therefore, I do not admit 
to such a possibility at all. The thing is to ensure that 
conditions are created within the framework of the Partnership 
for Peace program for small Central European nations and states 
to enable them, of their own will, to become a real entity in 
European politics.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak 
on 24 May on page 1 carries a 600-word interview with Peter 
Weiss, chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left, SDL, signed 
"alg" and entitled "I Do Not See Any Prospects of Cooperation." 
The interview, the place and date of which are not given, deals 
with the possibility of the SDL's post-election cooperation with 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia,HZDS. The same issue is 
also the subject of a 300-word interview with SDL Deputy 
Chairman Milan Ftacnik by Robert Kotian in Bratislava SME in 
Slovak on 24 May on page 1. 
  In the SLOVENSKY DENNIK interview, Weiss is asked to react 
to 
an interview with SDL Deputy Robert Fico, published in the 20 
May issue of LUC (BEAM), a regional daily published in Kosice, 
in which Fico reportedly said that "it should not be a problem 
for the SDL to cooperate with the HZDS after the elections, if 
the HZDS comes up with a program such as it had in 1992." Weiss 
replies that the HZDS electoral program and its practical policy 
are two different things, and continues: "I said before that the 
HZDS has become an etatist [etatisticky] movement pursuing a 
vulgar right-wing policy, aimed at satisfying the interests of 
the party's top echelons. It was simply impossible to cooperate 
with this policy. Moreover, the HZDS chairman personally did 
everything he could to damage relations with other political 
parties and their representatives. He personally destroyed all 
prerequisites for effective political cooperation." In Weiss' 
opinion, the SDL's decision to support the motion of 
no-confidence in Meciar on 11 March 1994 was correct: "We came 
out against a demagogic populist policy that was increasingly 
resorting to the crutches of nationalism, was irrational, and 
did not contribute to the solution of independent Slovakia's 
problems. So far, we have not received any signals that the 
HZDS would like to change this policy. The opposite is true. 
The HZDS election campaign is based on pitting Slovaks against 
the Hungarians and the Czechs and one group of Slovaks against 
another group of Slovaks. It is based on the creation of the 
image of an enemy and we cannot agree with such policy." 
  Asked whether the SDL could cooperate with a HZDS without 
Meciar, Weiss replies that "Mr. Meciar is the strongest current 
in the HZDS and I cannot imagine the HZDS without Meciar." 
Weiss also denies the existence of any pressure from the SDL 
rank-and-file to cooperate with the HZDS after the elections. 
In conclusion, he reiterates that "if the HZDS policy does not 
change -- and there is no indication of that -- I see no basis 
for post-election cooperation with the HZDS." 
  In the SME interview, the place and date of which are not 
given, SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik refuses to give a 
definite reply to the question of possible HZDS-SDL cooperation, 
arguing that the party leadership has not yet discussed the 
issue. Confronted with the statement made by SDL Deputy Robert 
Fico to the daily LUC that "there should be no obstacles" to 
post-election cooperation between the SDL and the HZDS, as long 
as the HZDS observes its 1992 program, Ftacnik says: "I consider 
this to be Deputy Fico's personal view. We have not yet 
discussed this issue in substance within the SDL. We are now 
prepared to clarify it in a democratic manner, first within the 
party and, subsequently, with our coalition partners. This can 
no longer be only our decision. The coalition partners are to 
submit by 30 June the principles of post-election cooperation 
and our party bodies should clarify this issue in substance by 
then."

  [Text] Representatives of rightwing forces in Slovakia held 
their third meeting last night, following the parliament 
session. Their one-hour discussion focused on the possibility of 
forming a strong rightwing election bloc. According to Jan 
Carnogursky, the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] is 
skeptical in that respect. That is what he briefly told me about 
the bloc, which is also represented by the National Democratic 
Party, the Democratic Union, the Democratic Party, and the Party 
of Businessmen and Tradesmen. 
  [Begin recording] [Carnogursky] If all of us wanted to form 
one election bloc, then according to the Elections Law, it would 
mean that we would have to win at least 10 percent of the vote 
in order to actually make it into the parliament. For that 
reason, we have simply continued pursuing our idea of getting 
rightwing deputies to the Slovak parliament. That trend will 
continue until 10 June. Thereafter, the party ticket will be 
complete because extending the process of forming election blocs 
and negotiating after 10 June would be wasteful. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Cernak [National Democratic Party chairman] 
said he will not form any election coalition without you, the 
KDH. What is the situation with regard to the Democratic Union, 
the party headed by a chairman who enjoys the greatest 
popularity of around 20 percent? What is the Democratic Union's 
reaction? 
  [Carnogursky] The Democratic Union intends to go into the 
elections alone and it is not contemplating a coalition with any 
other party. [end recording]

the Partnership for Peace program, it will not accede to Russian 
demands, said Jiri Payne, chairman of the parliament's foreign 
affairs committee, in reaction to Russian demands that the 
Partnership for Peace agreement be accompanied by a treaty 
guaranteeing a system of consultation between Russia and NATO. 
Payne described as rather shocking the notion that Russia should 
take part in decisions concerning the expansion of NATO to 
include Central and Eastern Europe.

  [Excerpts] Czech President Vaclav Havel will visit 
Bratislava on 26 May as one of three meetings that he and Slovak 
President Michal Kovac have agreed to hold annually. Before his 
visit he gave an interview to Slovak Radio Prague correspondent 
Daniela Galikova. 
  [Begin recording] [Galikova] Do you think there has been a 
qualitative shift in Czech-Slovak relations since the split of 
the Czechoslovak Federation? 
  [Havel] Shortly after the split some problems were very 
sensitive, burning, and painful. Much was written about them, 
and excessive emphasis was placed on their political aspect. My 
view is that they have probably been transformed into more 
matter-of-fact issues. [passage omitted] 
  [Galikova] The new Slovak cabinet has been in office for 
over 
a month now. It is generally being perceived as the cabinet 
that has contributed to calming down the Slovak political scene. 
Do you think that now is the right time to discuss the issues 
pertaining to Czech-Slovak relations that remain unsolved, 
especially considering (?very tense relations) with the current 
Slovak opposition? 
  [Havel] My view is that we are not in a hurry. It would be 
damaging if any hurried solution to those issues that remain 
open were to interfere with the pre-election situation in 
Slovakia or cause any unnecessary polarization. For various 
reasons I do not think that it would be a good thing if 
something that might be called the Czech card were to play a 
role in the Slovak elections. This would not be good. That is 
why I think it is better to work calmly and to make certain 
preparations. Once agreements are ripe for being concluded, we 
can conclude them. However, taking the elections into account, 
I do not think it would be good to hurry anything. [end

  [Text] With the latest interim results of talks between 
Czech and Slovak Presidents Vaclav Havel and Michal Kovac in 
Bratislava, here is Eva Hulkova. 
  [Begin recording] According to Czech presidential spokesman 
Ladislav Spacek, President Havel stressed that the foreign 
policy orientation of both countries is very similar, and in 
some respects identical. 
  Unresolved issues between the two countries have, in the 
eyes 
of both sides, ceased to be political and have become the 
subject of negotiations between experts. Of 12 agreements 
expected to be signed, eight have been signed already. 
President Kovac expressed the hope that the process of 
concluding the agreements might be completed by the end of the 
year. The Czech Republic praised the fact that the Slovak 
Republic had agreed to a standard form of border controls, and 
the formal signing of a treaty to that effect is equally in 
sight. 
  The presidents stated that the fall in trade between the two 
countries constituted a certain weakening of mutual relations. 
According to President Kovac, administrative standardization in 
both countries and the process of transformation, whereby the 
state has fewer possibilities of intervention, are throwing up 
barriers in the culture and education spheres. The decline in 
cultural and educational exchange activity could be compensated 
for by nongovernment-sponsored arrangements. President Havel 
proposed in this context the setting up of an Institute of 
Czecho-Slovak Studies. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prince Karl Schwarzenberg, chief of Czech </F>
President Havel's cabinet, by Xavier Gautier; place and date not 
given: "The `Good Intentions' of the Balladur Plan"] 
  [Text]Karl Schwarzenberg, chief of President Vaclav 
Havel's personal cabinet since 1989 and heir to a long line of 
Austro- Hungarian prince-diplomats, remains, one year after the 
partitioning of Czechoslovakia, the closest adviser to the 
father of the "Velvet Revolution." Now living in Prague, this 
Vienna-educated prince is one of the most committed spokesmen 
voicing the hopes and frustrations of central Europe with regard 
to Brussels' partial opening-up to the new democracies. 
  [Gautier] What are your views on the Conference on Stability 
that opens today in Paris and will attempt to solve the problems 
of good-neighborliness between the countries of central Europe? 
  [Schwarzenberg] Can you imagine a roundtable organized in 
Biscay, in the French Basque country, organized so that France, 
Spain, Ireland, and Britain could discuss the Basque and Irish 
problems under the benevolent supervision of the Czechs and the 
Americans? No? Neither can I. 
  [Gautier] But does not the "Balladur plan" provide the new 
democracies with a forum to talk about their problems? 
  [Schwarzenberg] All this reminds me of the story concerning 
my great grandfather, a very wise man who lived in the last 
century. One day he was introduced to some very pretty girls 
with the aim of getting him to marry one of them. "She is 
superb," he said, "she will be perfect for my best friend." 
Well, Mr. Balladur's plan is doubtless superb, but it is solely 
suited to his best friend. 
  [Gautier] Seen from Prague, does the conference appear 
destined to fail? 
  [Schwarzenberg] Let me return to my hypothetical "Biscay" 
roundtable. If it were a roundtable, we would have had to 
prepare for the Conference on Stability in Europe to get down to 
some long- term work, especially since by exposing our intimate 
problems for all the world to see, we risk opening a new 
Pandora's box. The founding fathers of the "stability pact" do 
not have solid experience of the problems in our part of Europe. 
  [Gautier] France and its European neighbors have not, 
however, spared any efforts to understand the situation in 
central Europe. 
  [Schwarzenberg] Karl Kraus, the Austrian author of "Last 
Days 
of Humanity," once wrote: "Good intentions are the opposite of 
good politics." (Footnote 1) (Karl Kraus was one of the 
journalists most feared by the Austro-Hungarian government early 
in this century.) 
  I think that the conference was put together by bureaucrats 
who had plenty of good intentions, but whose spirit was too 
Cartesian. The Europeans will soon run up against prejudices 
which are deeply rooted in the spirits of their interlocutors. 
In our part of the world, resentment goes way back in history. 
  [Gautier] In this connection, the Czech Republic, the United 
States, and even Moscow have been asked to play a mediating role 
at this conference. Is that not the beginning of a good idea? 
  [Schwarzenberg] In a pinch, the Baltic problem could be 
compared to the Basque problem. However, if the Russian 
federation sits down at the negotiating table as a mediator -- 
and what other role could it play? -- then it will run into 
opposition from the Baltic countries, which is understandable. 
  [Gautier] Is your pessimism not out of place when one 
observes the way in which Europe successfully offered a status 
to South Tyrol, which is disputed by Austria and Italy? 
  [Schwarzenberg] Of course, but the issue of South Tyrol was 
limited. It demanded the commitment of two neighbors, both 
members of the European Community [as published]. 
  [Gautier] What do you think the chances are of saving the 
Paris Conference? 
  [Schwarzenberg] The kind of problem the conference is 
studying cannot be resolved with great pomp. France cites the 
example of the Madrid conference on the Middle East, but Madrid 
did not yield anything. Only the Oslo negotiations, which were 
held in secret and spread out over two years, resulted in the 
agreements on Jericho and Gaza. 
  [Gautier] Speaking of your Slovak neighbor, the problem of 
the Hungarian minority seemed like a riddle a month ago. Yet, 
Jozef Moravcik, the new prime minister, has just submitted a 
bill protecting minority rights, without the help of the 
Europeans. What does Prague think about that? 
  [Schwarzenberg] The new government in Bratislava has, thank 
God, taken the exact opposite course of its predecessor's 
policies. It has decided to tackle the problems of minorities in 
a pragmatic way. The Slovak Government now needs support not 
just from its neighbors, but from Europe as a whole.

<F P=106> ["Text" of Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock's speech at </F>
the Sudeten German Days in Nuremberg, date not given; statement 
made by Czech President Vaclav Havel after his visit to Austria 
on 29 March; and the "texts" of the invitations sent to Czech 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Chairman of the Czech Social 
Democratic Party Milos Zeman to take part in the Sudeten German 
Days, dates not given: "Subject: The Sudeten German Days 21-22 
May 1994"] 
  [Text]Speech by Austrian Foreign Minister Dr. Alois 
Mock for the Sudeten German Days in Nuremberg and published in 
the weekly SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: "Open to the Demands of the 
Ethnic Minorities" 
  In my capacity as Austrian foreign minister, I greet most 
cordially all the participants in the 45th Sudeten German Days! 
I do so not only in view of our common Austrian past, but also 
in appreciation of just how substantially the 160,000 Sudeten 
Germans who found a new home in Austria after 1945, and their 
descendants, have contributed to our country's recovery. 
  The Sudeten Germans' view of history still continues to be 
clouded by memories of the iniquities suffered. In my opinion, 
we must -- in this very issue -- take seriously the obligation 
that we should come to terms honorably with the past, because 
respect for the tens of thousands of innocent victims of the 
expulsions enjoins us to do so. 
  In this connection, I am reminded of the great words of the 
first Austrian federal chancellor after 1945, Leopold Figl, who 
in his time suffered in Nazi concentration camps, but, despite 
this, said: "Let us not forget, but let us forgive!" 
  I know that this point of view is also shared by the Sudeten 
Germans. The "Charter of German Expellees" from 1950 contains 
the following poignant sentences: 
  "We expelled Germans renounce revenge and retaliation. This 
binding decision is sacred to us given the memory of the 
infinite suffering that the last decade in particular (that is, 
the period from 1940 to 1950) has brought to mankind." 
  During the period when the aforementioned charter was 
formulated, we could still hope that Europe was finally 
beginning another chapter in its history. Today we are 
witnesses to how our continent is again afflicted with the crime 
of mass resettlement. 
  Few people have expressed the association between the fate 
of 
the Sudeten Germans and some current events so clearly and 
pointedly as Czech President Vaclav Havel, who, as we know, 
feels that everyone who approves of the resettlement of the 
German ethnic minority also in fact approves of the ethnic 
cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In any case, I am convinced that it would be disastrous if 
Europe were again to make the same mistakes as it did in 1945. 
  In short, we must not let brute force gain ground unlawfully 
in Europe again. We must not let someone -- for the second time 
in less than 50 years in Europe -- in the services of the 
cynical policy of "ethnic cleansing" commit acts that cannot be 
prevented without, at the same time, leading to new acts of 
injustice. 
  Moreover, we must -- with a thought for the fate of the 
Sudeten Germans and the current events in southeastern Europe -- 
strive unconditionally to define functioning European national 
and minority rights. 
  Austrian foreign policy -- like the expellees' unions -- has 
long been striving for this. 
  Therefore, we ascribe extraordinary importance to the 
decision made at the Vienna meeting involving the presidents and 
prime ministers of the Council of Europe member countries, a 
decision whereby the protection of minorities is to become the 
subject of an appropriate general convention and of a 
supplementary protocol to the European Convention on Human 
Rights. 
  After 1945, the Sudeten Germans had to establish a 
completely 
new existence. They have done so in a remarkable manner. 
  In the majority of cases, however, they had probably already 
given up hope of renewing contacts with their old homeland. 
Thanks to the Iron Curtain and communist dictatorship, the past 
seemed to be irrevocable. 
  It is absolutely understandable that today, when the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia are again embarking on a road toward 
democracy, a law-governed state, and respect for human rights, 
the Sudeten Germans are asking whether the moment has also not 
come when a new chapter in the history of relations with their 
former homeland could be opened. 
  I -- at least -- have resolved that I will use every 
suitable 
opportunity to bring the demands of the Sudeten Germans to the 
attention of our Czech and Slovak partners and that I will 
emphasize our interest in ensuring that this issue is resolved 
with a view to the future and in the spirit of good neighborly 
relations. 
  In particular, I feel that it could be possible for the 
Sudeten Germans to become involved to a greater extent in the 
endeavors to develop the Czech Republic and Slovakia 
economically. 
  As the first precedential cases have indicated, the Sudeten 
Germans are well prepared for economic activity in their former 
homeland. From a general point of view, these people -- thanks 
to their intensely close ties to the country -- would probably 
often be more willing to mobilize local resources than other 
foreign investors (oriented, exclusively, toward profit). 
  The time is probably not yet ripe for more comprehensive 
plans of this nature. 
  Despite that, I will continue to orient my efforts in that 
direction. I will do so because I consider Austria's relations 
with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and our other Danubian 
neighbors to be -- especially under the new conditions -- an 
important point of our foreign policy. 
  With respect to those countries, we now have the 
opportunity to implement extensive practical cooperation. Not 
only between governments, parliaments, local representative 
offices, professional organizations, special-interest groups, 
and political parties, but also internationally, on foreign and 
defense policy as well as the economy, culture, and 
environmental protection. 
  I am convinced that the Sudeten Germans can help to 
implement 
such a policy. 
  I am also expressing this desire because I know what 
genuinely unequivocal Europeans the expellees have become thanks 
to their tragic fate. 
  The expellees' charter contained the following in August 
1950: "We will support every effort oriented toward creating a 
united Europe in which all peoples can live freely and without 
fear." 
  Austria is now standing on the threshold of a united Europe. 
If on 12 June the Austrian people decide in favor of our 
country's membership of the European Union, Austria will be able 
to take an active role in creating this the most significant 
practical peaceful achievement in European history. 
  We will be able to take part in building a peaceful Europe, 
a 
Europe full of increasing mutuality. We will do this, because a 
united Europe represents the best guarantee that the terrible 
fate visited on the Sudeten Germans in 1945 will never be 
repeated under its roof. 
Statement Made by President Vaclav Havel Following his 
Return From a State Visit to Austria on 29 March 1993 
  We are building a new democratic and law-governed state; we 
are building a civic society. This state cannot be founded on 
heresies, lies, or prejudices; this could regress tragically 
upon us. The issue for me involves the cleanliness of our 
political maturity. The ability to look our own past in the face 
is also part of this. 
  The forced evacuation of millions of people, based on a 
purely national principle -- that is, on the principle of 
collective guilt -- is a morally defective act. Approving of it 
means indirectly approving of the forced evacuation of Jews, 
Tatars, Lithuanians, and other peoples from their homes; it also 
means approving of the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. It is 
impossible to build a civic society on the endorsement of such 
dangerous national acts. Just as national self-awareness cannot 
be founded on forged manuscripts, it cannot be founded on any 
other national prejudice. It is even necessary to say far more 
unpleasant things about ourselves: For example, that, during 
the First Republic, we did not manage to resolve the issue of 
the minorities satisfactorily; that Slovakia was not always 
treated well; that our resistance fighters did not enjoy too 
much support among the public either during the war or under 
communism, and people preferred to steer clear of them; that the 
major part of the public voted for the communists; that we 
allowed the suffering of the Jews to be kept quiet; that many 
Czechs did not stand up for them during the war; and that, after 
the Munich diktat, many Czechs and Czech organizations descended 
into the most shameful anti-Semitism. 
  We are no worse than others; but we are no better. In my 
opinion, it is the duty of a president to point out these 
unpopular things. We are obliged to tell the truth about 
ourselves, first and foremost, for our own sakes and that of our 
descendants. It is surely possible to discuss, at the 
appropriate level, the evacuation of the Sudeten Germans, but it 
is even more important for us to discuss it without prejudice 
among ourselves. I have spoken about this many times and always 
here, at home. I remember the visit of President Weizsaecker 
and his speech in the Vladislav Hall. However, if I am asked 
abroad for my opinion, I give the same answer there as at home, 
for I am not schizophrenic, saying one thing abroad and another 
here. 
  Of course, I did not go to Austria so that I could discuss 
this issue there, but, at the same time, I did not go there to 
avoid unpleasant questions. Incidentally, in my statements, the 
moral condemnation of the evacuation was completely in the shade 
of my interpretation of why the legal aspect of this issue is 
closed and unchangeable for us and why no legal consequences can 
arise from a moral judgment. I think that I explained this more 
thoroughly than many of my critics here. 
  The fact that my critics condemned my statements without 
knowing them testifies to the very weak political culture in our 
country. Understandably, the Office of the President has -- from 
the first moment -- kept a precise record of everything that I 
have said; however, no one has called and asked for a copy of 
what I said. This affirms that my critics are not interested in 
the facts, but only in muddying the waters and in fawning to 
those who, after a taboo lasting decades, find it difficult to 
come to terms with certain things. No government representative 
or representative of the ruling coalition has made it clear to 
me in our numerous meetings that he does not share my view on 
this matter. Therefore, I perceive the statements of some 
opposition officials as an attempt to drive a wedge between 
myself and the ruling coalition. However, they will not succeed 
in this. And something else: It does not surprise me that it 
is the left that is defending the evacuation so robustly. 
Collectivism is close to it and, since communist collectivism 
has collapsed, it obviously needs national collectivism as a 
replacement, dividing nations into the guilty and the innocent. 
  However, in the elections, our citizens cast their votes 
for the ideal of a civic society in which each individual is 
responsible for his own acts and they cast their votes for 
parties that defend the inviolability of private ownership and 
all civil rights. Of course, following this path also means 
knowing how to admit that we did not always manage to govern 
ourselves by these principles. 
  The evacuation is a bygone act of a democratic government, 
an 
act confirmed by the victorious powers, an act legally valid and 
unchangeable. We are trying with difficulty to correct some of 
the wrongs of communism, but we cannot and will not rectify past 
history and thus commit new wrongs. That would be absurd. This 
absolutely unequivocal stance, however, does not relieve us of 
the obligation to tell -- in our own interest -- the complete 
truth about our history, albeit unpleasant and unpopular, and to 
admit that even a democratic government was capable of 
succumbing to the Stalinist way of thinking and thus of 
preparing for the rise of Stalinism. This is a matter for our 
spiritual and moral wellbeing. The strength of our republic 
will not lie in avoiding the truth, but in the will to recognize 
it. 
Invitation to Vaclav Klaus (as Chairman of the Civic 
Democratic Party) To Take Part in the Sudeten German Days in 
Nuremberg This Weekend 
  Esteemed Mr. Chairman, 
  The proposal for a Sudeten German-Czech dialogue, which is 
also supported by many important German politicians of all 
persuasions, is indeed intended to overcome the barriers of the 
past and to seek a solution to the problems and a path toward a 
positive future. 
  As a sign of our desire to meet each other half way and seek 
a new beginning in relations between Czechs and Germans from 
Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, we would like cordially to invite 
you and other representatives from your party to this year's 
principal meeting of the Sudeten Germans at the Sudeten German 
Days 1994 in Nuremberg on the Whitsuntide weekend. 
  We would be pleased to welcome you among us. The enclosed 
honorary passes contain information on the most important events 
and points on the agenda of these Sudeten German Days, whose 
course and "Aussagen" [message] should promote a peaceful and 
conciliatory future. 
  I repeat my invitation and remain, with friendly greetings, 
  Yours, 
  Franz Neubauer. 
The Letter From Representatives of the Sudeten German 
Council to the Chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party; 
the Chairmen of the Other Political Parties Also Received a 
Similar Letter 
  Esteemed Mr. Chairman, 
  The Sudeten German issue is constantly being aired and 
discussed in the Czech media. Such discussions -- associated 
with assumptions and fear -- are also being conducted among the 
people themselves. 
  This indicates that Sudeten German issues are indeed a 
problem that has still not been resolved so that it is possible 
to guarantee the further calm and successful development of the 
Czech Republic and of its relations with Germany. 
  The Sudeten Germans have long and repeatedly proposed and 
offered a Sudeten German-Czech dialogue, because only a dialogue 
begun without bias and accusation will overcome the prejudices, 
eradicate the misunderstandings, and bring the problems closer 
to a solution. 
  On account of many misunderstandings, we point out once 
again 
that the Sudeten German Council explained a long time ago that, 
for it, the issue of the borders has never come up. This means 
that all the models for a solution under discussion must be 
considered within the Czech Republic. 
  While this dialogue was begun some time ago on a lower 
platform and among people, it is still being rejected, as 
previously, in the political sphere. This does not only meet 
with incomprehension among us Sudeten Germans, but also among 
the faraway German and Austrian political circles. 
  Therefore, we invite you to participate in an extensive 
Czech- Sudeten German dialogue without bias! At the same time, 
we are convinced that you also see the need for such a dialogue 
to improve German-Czech relations. It would please us very much 
if you would accept our invitation to the talks. 
  It would certainly be meaningful if this dialogue could 
begin 
soon. 
  We suggest that the dialogue be preceded first by 
lower-level 
talks between representatives from the democratic parties in the 
Czech National Council and representatives from the Sudeten 
German Council aimed at reaching agreement on the participants, 
subjects, and dates for the dialogue. 
  We look forward to your timely point of view and remain, 
with 
cordial greetings, 
  Franz Neubauer, Volkmar Gabert, Herbert Werner, and Heinz 
Kraus.

  [Excerpts] National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov 
is already at the National Assembly rostrum and Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov is in the Assembly hall. Everything is ready for 
the official announcement. 
  [Yordanov] I call upon Mr. Kiril Zhelev to announce the 
results of the voting on the confidence motion in the cabinet of 
Lyuben Berov. 
  [Zhelev] A secret vote took place today at the request of 
the Council of Ministers to receive a vote of confidence. 
[passage omitted] Some 221 National Assembly deputies voted. 
Some 125 cast their ballots in support of the confidence 
motion, with 95 against. One National Assembly member cast an 
empty vote. There were no invalid ballots. On the basis of the 
results, the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria, 
based on Article 112, Paragraph 1 of the Bulgarian Constitution 
and in connection with Article 83, Paragraph 4 of the 
Regulations on National Assembly Activity, has decided to grant 
confidence in the government in connection with its Program of 
Intent Until September 1994. 
  [Yordanov] Mr. Prime Minister, you may take the floor. 
  [Berov] Esteemed Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, and 
People's Representatives: It is usually customary on such 
occasions to express gratitude. However, I think that even 
those who, because of various reasons, oppose me would hardly 
envy me for the task that has been bestowed on me for the next 
three and a half months. This task is to steer the ship on 
which all of us are traveling through troubled voters, near 
dangerous rocks, and toward some safe port. This is a difficult 
task and this is a contradictory country. I promise to make 
every effort to implement my task and steer the ship toward a 
safe port. Thank you. [applause, jeers] 
  [Yordanov] Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I now hand the 
floor over to Mr. Vasil Gotsev, who will speak on behalf of the 
Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] parliamentary faction. 
  [Gotsev] Esteemed Mr. Chairman, esteemed ladies and 
gentlemen, People's Representatives, and Mr. Professor Berov, 
who, after everything that has happened, I cannot calmly call 
Mr. Prime Minister: 
  We have witnessed another parliamentary farce, which took 
place in this hall last week. [passage omitted] After being 
supported by only 25 members of the National Assembly in last 
week's no-confidence motion proposed by the SDS, the prime 
minister failed to do what a prime minister should do in every 
democratic state where the parliament and the Constitution are 
respected -- resign. [passage omitted] Instead of doing this 
-- devoid of any political and human dignity, pardon the 
expression -- this prime minister forced us to vote confidence 
in connection with this government's plans until September 1994. 
[passage omitted] 
  Only 25 deputies gave you their vote of confidence last 
week. 
This means you did not receive a vote of confidence for what you 
have done so far. Why then did you ask for a vote of confidence 
until September? What parliament prolonged the life of this 
disgraceful cabinet by giving it their confidence? 
  Indeed, what actually took place today behind closed doors 
-- 
on the one hand, at the meeting of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
faction, where long discussions were held and where prudent 
people certainly said that we must proceed toward early 
parliamentary elections and, on then other hand, in your room, 
Mr. Dogan? You implemented the instructions of the ambassador 
of a foreign state, the very same state that under the name of 
the USSR dictated everything that took place in our country. 
Today you obeyed the orders of [Russian] Ambassador Avdeyev. 
This shows the civilized world your true colors. 
  Ladies and gentlemen and people's representatives, we are 
witnessing the agony of our state, not just the agony of this 
government. All of you who supported a prime minister that 
disregarded the Constitution, the principles of 
parliamentarianism, and the interests of the Bulgarian people 
contributed to this agony. However, despite your desire to rule 
until the end of your life at the early elections, the Bulgarian 
people will cast their votes for those who today did not support 
you. [applause] 
  [Yordanov] Thank you, Mr. Gotsev. I close the session. The 
next session will take place tomorrow at 0900.

  [Text] India and Bulgaria have signed six agreements for 
promoting cooperation in various fields. The agreements were 
signed in Sofia yesterday on the first day of the state visit of 
the president, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, to Bulgaria. An 
important agreement signed by the two countries relates to 
cooperation in combating international terrorism and illegal 
trafficking in narcotic drugs. The home minister, Mr. S.B. 
Chavan, signed the agreement on behalf of India. The other 
agreements relate to cooperation in tourism, avoidance of double 
taxation and for cooperation in plant protection measures and in 
veterinary and sanitation areas. Earlier, the president, Dr. 
Sharma, had talks with the Bulgarian president, Dr. Zhelyu 
Zhelev. The talks later continued at delegation levels. 
  The Bulgarian president supported India's stand on Kashmir 
and urged New Delhi and Islamabad to resolve the issue through 
bilateral talks under the Simla Agreement. An official 
spokesman said Dr. Sharma appreciated Bulgaria's consistent 
support to issues of concern to India. The two leaders also 
discussed bilateral issues and matters of regional importance. 
  Speaking at a banquet hosted in his honor by the Bulgarian 
president, Dr. Sharma underlined the need for closer economic 
cooperation between the two countries. He said the changes 
which have taken place in both the countries have opened up 
fresh avenues of cooperation and urged entrepreneurs to take 
full advantage of the emerging markets. He said the 
Indo-Bulgarian friendship is motivated by the desire to work for 
a peaceful world and harmonious humanity.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman </F>
Simona Miculescu by an unidentified correspondent on 25 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] We have phoned you because we 
would like to know the opinion of the Romanian Foreign Ministry 
on the events in the Crimea. 
  [Miculescu] Good evening. Certainly I am going to answer 
you with greatest pleasure, as I do every time for the Romanian 
Radio Station. I could say that the Romanian side is following 
the evolution of situation in Ukraine with great attention. In 
connection with the recent events in Crimea, events that, as a 
matter of fact, are the subject of much information issued in 
the Romanian and foreign press, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs believes that this represents an internal problem of 
Ukraine, because Crimea is part and parcel of this neighboring 
country of Romania. 
  Likewise, I would like to mention that we assess the careful 
attitude adopted by the authorities of the Russian Federation on 
this issue as a positive sign. I would like to conclude by 
expressing hope that this situation will be solved through 
political means and it is our belief that the consolidation of 
independence and stability in Ukraine is very important for the 
entire region and Europe in general. 
  [Correspondent] Thus, if the situation is settled through 
political means, in view of this settlement, what are the 
actions planned by the Romanian diplomacy to intensify relations 
with Ukraine, a country that is our neighbor? 
  [Miculescu] Certainly we hope that this political settlement 
will come as soon as possible, and in practical terms, as you 
well know, obviously we will work for the development and 
consolidation of bilateral relations with this neighboring 
country and we will amplify political dialogue at all levels. 
However, at the appropriate time, we are going to inform you 
about all details and I hope we will be able to give you those 
details as soon as possible. 
  [Correspondent] In fact we wanted to find out whether there 
is any immediate action on the diplomatic agenda of the Romanian 
foreign minister in connection with Ukraine. 
  [Miculescu] There are no immediate plans, but we will inform 
you at the appropriate time, as we do every time. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you very much for this interview. 
  [Miculescu] It was my great pleasure.

<F P=106> [Article by Oliviu Gherman, president of the Social </F>
Democracy Party of Romania and president of the Senate, in 
response to a 14 May interview with Vasile Secares, president of 
"A Future for Romania" Group: "Politics From the Outside"] 
  [Text] I have carefully read Mr. Vasile Secares' interview 
with CURIERUL NATIONAL and I cannot refrain from making a few 
remarks in this connection. I would like to point out that I do 
not intend to enter into a polemical discussion with Mr. 
Secares, but I would rather try to clarify a few points raised 
in my interview with the same newspaper, an interview that was 
published a few days before his interview. For the uninformed 
reader, I would like to recall that "A Future for Romania" was 
initially the title of one of the three motions submitted to the 
28 March 1992 National Convention of the former National 
Salvation Front [FSN], a motion that was not adopted. During 
the aforementioned convention, the FSN split and a grouping 
initially called the Democratic National Salvation Front [FDSN] 
and later the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] emerged. 
What happened with the "A Future for Romania" option? Well, it 
remained outside the party structures, turning itself into a 
kind of "Political Academy," with an internal life tacitly 
supported through the functioning of the National School for 
Administrative Studies and Police, an institution sponsored by 
this grouping. 
  Of course, as I said, sometime in the middle of 1990, it is 
infinitely easier to sit on the sidelines and criticize what 
others are doing. By getting involved, you must cover the 
sinuous road of achievements and failures, which constantly 
exposes you to justified criticism of your mistakes. Examining 
now the road covered by the PDSR (and the FDSN previously), I 
can honestly say that many things could have been done 
differently than they actually were. Unfortunately -- or maybe 
one should say fortunately -- in politics, like in life, you 
cannot simultaneously follow two roads. You cannot both take a 
medicine and also not take it if you want to check its 
usefulness. In politics, you must assume responsibility for 
decisions where the alternatives are not clear-cut. Most often, 
you have to choose between 45-55 percent solutions, in 
circumstances whereby it is impossible to estimate the evolution 
of the two choices. The people involved in politics are held 
responsible for all bungling decisions, while the fact that 
someone has to take a decision of sorts is often omitted. 
Therefore, we would have gladly welcomed the involvement of the 
supporters of the aforementioned motion in a party political 
activity and we would have applauded their successes and 
criticized their failures. That would have been a more manly 
and honest dispute. Unfortunately, the majority of motion 
supporters, including Mr. Vasile Secares, preferred to remain 
outside the party battle and slightly above it so as to 
occasionally pass judgment -- often quite pertinently -- on the 
political climate in Romania. It is like writing reports about 
a war you are not participating in. However, there is no doubt 
that they are entitled to their choice. Returning to my 
previous interview, I would like to emphasize several other 
elements. First, referring to the political crisis in Romania, 
Mr. Secares fails to give an appropriate explanation. If he 
wants to characterize the entire post-December 1989 political 
life in our country by using the term "crisis," then I must 
agree with him: Yes, we are going through a political crisis 
characteristic of the stage of political infancy, whose main 
feature is the miming of authentic politics, which is not 
suitable to Romania's situation of today. Indeed, by avoiding 
the imperious requirements of the current period, the political 
forces in Romania engaged themselves in a sterile dispute that 
has nothing to do with what must be done by all of us. I 
remember a significant moment. A few weeks ago -- to be more 
precise, in a television broadcast on Monday 25 April -- 
correspondent Cristache asked Petre Roman, president of the 
Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)], whether 
he feels he is fulfilling his mission of parliamentarian. With 
his known elegance and precision, Mr. Petre Roman presented a 
summary of the parliamentary actions, with which he has combated 
the governmental solutions. It was a kind of synopsis of an 
opposition stance. There is no doubt that we do not have the 
right to ignore the barricade side we happen to be on. 
Nevertheless, reality is above us all. I would have liked to 
ask my friend and political adversary Petre Roman what his 
answers might have been to all those accusations if he had been 
the leader of the government party or the country's prime 
minister? In today's conditions, are we allowed to change our 
options from one extreme to the other in function of our stand 
vis-a-vis those temporarily in power at a certain point? May we 
change our position vis-a-vis the relations with the IMF, as a 
function of whether we are in power or not? Therefore, 
proceeding from this example, I agree with the term of 
"politicking" used in the aforementioned interview, a term 
attributed to the attitude of the majority of the political 
parties in Romania. 
  If Mr. Secares is exclusively referring to the current 
moment when talking about the political crisis in Romania, I 
will tell him that he is wrong and tendentious. As I have 
already said in the past, the concept of political crisis, as it 
refers to a given moment, is a formula invented by the 
opposition in its attempt to gain political capital. For a long 
time, the PDSR was damned for everything by having the most 
colorful invectives hurled at it: neo, crypto, and everything 
else that could be put before the word "communist" was 
attributed to the party to suggest the revival of communism. 
  Initially, things were simplified to ridiculous proportions 
when one proceeded to evaluate the Romanian political spectrum: 
On the one hand, you had an identifiable evil -- that is, the 
PDSR, an infernal instrument of the return to the past; on the 
other hand, you had an incontestable good, represented by the 
forces of opposition, which are allegedly promoting progress and 
reform, although they opposed all measures for their 
implementation. This kind of evaluation lasted until a stable 
majority centered around the PDSR took shape. With the 
emergence of this majority, the concept of political crisis also 
emerged. The script is so simple and clear that I am offended 
by the hope of those who concocted it that we would fall into 
the trap set for us. The first stage consisted in an attempt to 
isolate the PDSR from its allies, which helped our party cover 
the Calvary of reform, by omitting to mention that those who 
claim to want the reform were also the ones who actually raised 
the greatest obstacles in the path of reform. I do not want to 
give examples, so as to not appear too obvious. The second 
stage consisted of an attempt to turn the PDSR, which ceased to 
be called neocommunist, into a kind of ping-pong match between 
the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and the PD(FSN) -- 
that is, into a kind of minority beggar within a coalition that 
would have decided its existence. 
  The solution proposed by Mr. Secares for solving the 
hardships of the transition in Romania is a variant of the "A 
Future for Romania" type, that is a nonparty or supraparty 
variant, which would realign the parliamentarians -- some from 
the PDSR, others from the CDR, and some from the PD(FSN). First 
of all, I regret that his solution omitted to mention the other 
parliamentary groupings, which are equally entitled to a role. 
I also cannot refrain from raising a scholarly question: On 
the basis of what criteria will those parliamentarians be 
elected? Are we going to set up a supraparty or an extraparty 
of just a few people? I believe the realistic thing to do is to 
convince all parties that, for a certain period of time, we must 
all work together to come out of the deadlock, while maintaining 
our identity, as it is confirmed by the various parliamentary 
and extraparliamentary official acts. 
  I am saying all this because I am deeply convinced that Mr. 
Secares' solution, although attractive at first glance, is mere 
utopia. I agree that we are at a crossroads, albeit less 
obvious than the ones we have put behind us in the past one and 
a half years of government. I agree that we must undertake 
something to ensure the triumph of the good values. However, 
unlike Mr. Secares, I believe that this can only be achieved 
from within the parties, be they good or less good, as the 
situation is today. We must pool our political efforts, but 
only after clarifications that must occur within each party. In 
the medium run, the parties must shape Romania's political life 
around several basic choices based on pragmatism: center-right, 
center, and center-left, with their natural satellites, to 
preserve the stability of the political spectrum.

  [Excerpts] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the 
Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] have concluded a 
cooperation agreement for the second round of the elections. 
Under the Christian-democratic agreement, they are to back the 
candidates of the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] in some 
places as well. Agnes Pap reports. 
  [Pap] [passage omitted] MDF Spokesman Karoly Herenyi said 
that not only was joining forces between the parties at issue 
but also the necessity to make a broader agreement. The leading 
bodies of the KDNP and the MDF want the Christian-democratic 
pooling of forces to come about among the voters, including 
those who voted for the FKGP. 
  Herenyi said that the MDF's voters would support the FKGP's 
candidates in 42 places where they have a chance to win. Under 
agreements concluded with the FKGP county chairmen in Somogy and 
Tolna counties [southern Hungary], the FKGP candidates are to 
support the MDF candidates in five places. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by an </F>
unidentified announcer in the studio -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] [passage omitted] My one and only 
guest tonight is Prime Minister Peter Boross. I respectfully 
welcome you in the studio. [passage omitted] 
  About the immediate future, if you will allow me: You very 
often emphasize that you wish to hand over the departments to 
the new government members in an extremely careful and 
respectable manner. Why is it important to stress this? 
  [Boross] I make no secret of the fact that I would like to 
create a tradition with this. [passage omitted] So I have 
prepared appropriate materials, reports--reports containing data 
for information as well--at the various ministries, and this 
kind of thing is being prepared in the office of the prime 
minister, too. 
  It surprises me....[pauses] Perhaps it was Hungarian 
Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn who last night said to you 
first of all: I would like to see the handover report now. 
Well, all I can reply to this is that one should wait and see 
who becomes prime minister. We have to have the election, then 
an agreement. I will not now hand it over to two, perhaps 
three, or even four people--because that is how many there are, 
at least, of those who wish to be, or might be, prime ministers. 
Then naturally, I will begin contacts with them, and naturally 
also with the parties, after 29 May. 
  [Announcer] You mentioned the parties. How do you see the 
stakes in the second round? 
  [Boross] That the total number of deputies of the Alliance 
of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
should not reach two-thirds. For me it is less important 
whether the MSZP exceeds 50 percent or not; on the other hand it 
is very important--and everywhere I try to say this, to persuade 
the voters to vote but not to vote for these two parties--that 
they do not achieve the two-thirds majority. 
  Two-thirds is a very dangerous threshold. In various debates 
these gentlemen, that is those of the SZDSZ and the MSZP, say 
that they will wish to cooperate with the opposition on the 
basis of negotiation even if they have this kind of majority. 
But politics has shown that it is better if guarantees remain 
within legal frameworks, and to overstep the two-thirds 
threshold is very dangerous. 
  About 40 deputies will be needed for the Hungarian 
Democratic 
Forum [MDF], the Christian Democrats, the Smallholders, and the 
Federation of Young Democrats out of the 174 individual 
constituencies still undecided so that there will not be a 
two-thirds majority. I am trying to persuade the voters, 
perhaps even those who voted for the two seemingly victorious 
parties, that it is now in their interest to vote for the above, 
and mainly for the candidates of the MDF. In that way there 
will be a healthy parliamentary life. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Geneva, May 26 (AFP) -- Bosnian Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic flew Thursday [26 May] to Zagreb for emergency 
talks on the situation in the Bihac pocket in northwestern 
Bosnia, under Serb attack, Bosnia's representative said here. 
Silajdzic, who headed his delegation at two days of peace talks 
in the French lake resort of Talloires, near Switzerland, flew 
from Geneva aboard the same plane taking back the Bosnian Croat 
delegation, Mustapha Bijedic said. 
  It was not immediately known who Silajdzic would be meeting 
in Zagreb, but Bijedic said "the situation was very serious" in 
the Moslem-held Bihac pocket. "The Serbs have launched an 
offensive against one of the UN safe areas in Bosnia (Bihac) and 
Mr. Akashi (the UN's special envoy to Yugoslavia) and the West 
are doing nothing," Bijedic said. 
  The UN Protection Force in Bosnia (UNPROFOR) confirmed that 
Serb forces have launched an offensive over the past 24 hours 
against Bihac, the western tip of Bosnia tucked into Croatia and 
besieged by Serb forces. The Serbs managed "a small advance" 
after firing more than 500 shells at Moslem positions on 
Wednesday, UNPROFOR said. 
  Bijedic refused to give any details on the two days of 
closed- door talks Wednesday and Thursday in the French Alpine 
hideaway which involved the warring parties, along with 
representatives of the United States, Russia, the European Union 
and the United Nations. The parties have agreed however to meet 
again in about 10 days, he said. 
  Aleska Buha, foreign minister of the self-proclaimed Bosnian 
Serb Republic, said the talks would again take place in 
Talloires.

  [Text] Skopje, 27 May (TANJUG) -- Media in Skopje report 
today that Defense Minister Vlado Popovski has said that the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is preparing a new scenario of 
exerting pressure on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM] by encouraging disputes on the border between Serbia and 
FYROM. Popovski said this in an address yesterday to officers 
of the FYROM Army. 
  After the plan to create Serbian regions in Macedonia 
failed, 
the idea of the border being a problem is now favored in Serbian 
circles, although under the Constitutions of both the Federal 
People's Republic of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia the [former Yugoslav] republics were 
treated as states, Popovski said. Talking to the officers, 
Minister Popovski denied the worldwide belief that FYROM has 
become an American aircraft carrier, and that America's military 
presence on its territory threatens the security of its 
neighbors.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prosecutor General Alush Dragoshi by Reis </F>
Cico in Tirana; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Cico] Mr. Prosecutor, the Greek mass media and 
government officials have declared that more than 30 minority 
members have been arrested in the south of Albania. What is 
your comment on these statements? 
  [Dragoshi] As is made known to the entire public through the 
Albanian mass media, some time ago the Tirana District 
Prosecutor's Office initiated criminal proceedings against five 
[as heard] minority members in the districts of Delvine, 
Sarande, and Gjirokaster, who are charged with ordinary and 
political crimes, such as the illegal keeping of arms and 
anti-constitutional activities. As the social danger of these 
criminal acts is very accentuated, we have arrested them. 
  The investigators charged to inquire into these cases have 
been sent to the respective districts to carry out the 
investigation of criminal cases and interrogate witnesses. More 
specifically, these investigators have summoned 30 or more 
witnesses to clarify these cases. That is, the fact of 
summoning these witnesses does not mean that they were 
apprehended or arrested by the Prosecutor's Office. They are 
summoned only to be interrogated as witnesses and to clarify 
charges against the persons arrested. The announcement on the 
arrest of these persons, broadcast by various mass media and the 
Greek Government officials, is not at all true. I, once again, 
declare publicly that this fact is not true. [as heard] 
  [Cico] How many arrested persons are there? 
  [Dragoshi] The number of the arrested persons, as I 
mentioned previously, is only six. They are now being 
investigated while under arrest. To inquire into their case, we 
will question witnesses, consider documentary evidence, and 
compile expert reports, as defined in the Code of Criminal 
Procedure.

<F P=106> ["Foreign Ministry Spokesman's Statement"] </F>
  [Text] Tirana, May 25 (ATA) -- Albanian Foreign Minister 
Alfred Serreqi received on May 24, 1994 the ambassador of the 
Greek Republic, Khristodhoulos Tsalikis, on the request of the 
latter. 
  Greek ambassador set forth to the Albanian foreign minister 
a 
demarche of Greek Government on the accuses of the authorities 
of the Albanian Public Order Ministry, against six people of 
Greek minority, for illegal possession of arms and for illegal 
activity against Albanian territory, in collaboration with Greek 
secret service. In the Greek Government demarche, among others 
is said, that in such a situation is impossible to hold the 
foreseen meeting between the Albanian and Greek officials, and 
let alone the meeting between the two foreign ministers. 
  Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi turned down the 
Greek demarche, considering it as a premature reaction and as an 
expression of good will lacking on the part of Greek Government, 
to develop a constructive and bilateral dialogue. He pointed 
out that the above-mentioned statement is not issued by the 
Ministry of Public Order, but by the Tirana Attorney's Office, 
and we are amazed by the fact that Greek Government confounds 
these two institutions, which in Albania are separate by law and 
independent from each other. 
  Minister Serreqi pointed out that the Greek act or demarche 
is completely unacceptable and constitutes an interference to 
the interior affairs of the independent Albanian judges and 
attorneys offices, which will hold a just and no-one sided 
judgment, in conformity with the laws of the Albanian state. 
  Between other things, Minister Serreqi pointed out to the 
Greek ambassador that the Albanian state doesn't base the 
treatment of its citizens on the ethnic belonging. He said that 
during the judgment, which will be opened, proofs will be 
presented, which will be treated by the independent judge's body 
with objectivity, professionalism, and full transparency. The 
Greek side has no right to prejudice the Albanian justice. 
  The Albanian Government confirms its readiness to contribute 
even in the future to the solution of all the disagreements 
between the two countries through the bilateral dialogue. The 
Albanian Government will be opened to the commissions or 
missions of the CSCE, EU, and the Security Council or other 
international institutions which are interested to give their 
contribution to their solution. 
  The spokesman expresses the doubt that the undevelopment of 
the meeting between the two foreign ministers, proposed by the 
Albanian side and accepted by the Greek side many days after the 
detention of the six accused people, the usage as a pretext for 
that by the Greek side of the announcement of the Tirana 
Attorney's Office, considering it as an announcement of the 
Ministry of Public Order, has more to do with the interior 
problems and the elections fevers in Greece and it is an 
expression of a constant nervousness of the Greek Government to 
the intensive attempts of the Albanian Government for a broader 
cooperation and stability in the region.

  [Text] Tirana, May 27 (ATA) -- President Berisha had today 
an warm and friendly meeting with a group of Swiss 
parliamentarians, the Press and Information Office at the 
presidency reported today. The Albanian president thanked the 
Swiss parliamentarians for the appreciations they made to the 
democracy development and the market economy reforms in Albania. 
Mr. Berisha said he was especially grateful of the assistance 
given to Albania in this transition period by the Swiss people 
and Government. The assistance has been important primarily in 
renewing the Albanian telecom, in education field, in training 
the Albanian diplomats and other important projects. 
  President Berisha informed the Swiss parliamentarians of the 
development of the democratic processes, the economic reforms 
and the human rights situation in Albania. Mr. Berisha spoke 
especially of the Greek minority in Albania saying that it is 
enjoying all the rights and freedom like the Albanian citizens. 
But on the other side, the president said, the minority is 
using as a prey of manipulations by certain ultranationalist and 
chauvinistic circles. 
  Referring to the crises in the region, President Berisha 
said 
it is very serious. President Berisha expressed once more the 
determination of Albania for self temperance in the dialogue and 
not moving the borders by violence. The dialogue between 
Pristina and Belgrade on the Kosova problem would be especially 
important in the presence of a third side, the president said. 
  The Swiss parliamentarians appreciated the approaches of 
Albania and expressed their support for a peaceful solution in 
the Balkans.

  [Text] Tirana, May 26 (ATA) -- On May 22-23, 1994, the 
financial police in cooperation with the Ministry of Public 
Order and the Attorney General's Office exercised control in the 
border areas along the Buna River and the Lake of Shkodra to 
intercept Montenegro bound smugglers of fuel. Three tankers, an 
IFA [expansion unknown] vehicle, and a van which had transported 
fuel as well as three persons filling barrels with fuel to be 
moved across the border were intercepted in the area of Kamice 
village. 
  Four motor boats coming from Montenegro, five Montenegrin 
citizens and an Albanian, who had come to get fuel from barrels 
along the Lake of Shkodra, were intercepted in the area of the 
Kasan village. Another 14 Albanian citizens, who were making 
ready to ship the fuel by motor boat were intercepted as well. 
Among them was a person armed with a hunting rifle. 
  Barrels of fuel and three Albanian citizens, smuggling 
fuels, 
were intercepted in the Samrish village along the Buna River. 
Also, Montenegrin motor boats which has crossed the Albanian 
water frontier for fuel contraband were intercepted. 
  In the area of the Murriqan village, again along the Buna 
River, three Albanians were intercepted while smuggling fuel 
across the frontier in collaboration with Montenegrins, who fled 
immediately on a motor-boat as the Albanian order forces 
intervened. 
  In the end of the control on contraband and violation of the 
embargo imposed by the United Nations, acts which run counter to 
the laws of the Albanian state, 24 Albanian and five Montenegrin 
citizens were denounced for criminal prosecution, and five 
vehicles, about 160 barrels of oil as well as large quantities 
of empty barrels were intercepted. 
  It is not the first time that the financial police bodies 
and 
those of the public order have exercised unexpected controls to 
prevent smuggling of fuel into Montenegro. Over the recent 
months, pipes were discovered in the Lake of Shkodra, which 
served the transportation of these fuels into the Montenegrin 
territory. Several tankers have also been intercepted recently 
in Malesia e Madhe, which had transported fuel out of the 
Albanian frontiers. For this reason, customs officials as well 
as public order employees of the border crossing point were 
detained.

  [Text] Tirana, May 26 (ATA) -- Today, the court of appeal, 
led by Mr. Prele Martini, decided a sentence of 12 years of 
imprisonment for Fatos Nano, the last socialist premier of 
Albania and leader of the Socialist Party. It also passed 
punishments of 3 years of imprisonment for Sokrat Plaka and 1 
year imprisonment for Hasan Hallko. The decision of the Tirana 
court on March 30 was 12 years of imprisonment for Fatos Nano, 3 
years for Sokrat Plaka and 1 year of imprisonment for Hasan 
Hallko. 
  The first session of the Nano case in the court of appeal 
was 
held on May 24 and the prosecutor Petrit Duka asked that the 
decision of the first instance be not changed for Fatos Nano 
while the imprisonment term for two former officials Plaka and 
Hallko be reduced. 
  Former socialist premier Fatos Nano, accused of 
misappropriation of state property and falsification of official 
documents, was first interrogated by the end of June 1993. In 
July 27 last year, Albanian parliament lifted the deputy 
immunity for Fatos Nano and on July 30 Nano was arrested.

  [Text] Sofia, May 25 (BTA) -- National Assembly Chairman 
Aleksandur Yordanov called on Prime Minister Lyuben Berov to 
resign. Only the prime minister's resignation would pave the way 
for early elections on the basis of the Constitution and the 
law, Yordanov said in a statement broadcast on national radio 
and television tonight. 
  In two days only the prime minister had two proofs that he 
does not enjoy parliament's political confidence, Aleksandur 
Yordanov said. He referred to the sitting last Thursday [19 
May] when the cabinet narrowly survived a no-confidence vote, 
supported by a mere 25 MP's, as well as to last Friday [20 May] 
when the MP's voted down Berov's proposals for structural and 
personnel changes to the cabinet. 
  What is needed for early elections is not agreements but an 
early end to the government's term; any other option is part of 
the pre- Constitution stage and is of no legal import, Yordanov 
said. He recalled that under the Bulgarian Constitution only 
after the prime minister's resignation can the president show 
constitutional initiative and assign the parliamentary groups to 
form a government; should they fail to do so, the president 
appoints a caretaker cabinet. Yordanov described any other 
initiative as an "infringement on the authority of others" 
which, in his view, destabilizes political life and the country 
as a whole. 
  On Friday President Zhelyu Zhelev appealed to the political 
forces to reach agreement, including the passage of a few key 
acts of parliament, a date for the elections, and the 
appointment of a caretaker cabinet by the president later on. 
Prime Minister Berov proposed more or less the same to the 
parliamentary forces two days later. "In the name of 
parliamentarism and democracy, I appeal to the prime minister 
and the president to refrain from such initiatives," Yordanov 
said.

  [Text] Sofia, May 26 (BTA) -- At noon today, Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov asked parliament to take a vote of 
confidence in his government. The decision was made this 
morning at a regular cabinet meeting, said Government Spokesman 
Raycho Raykov. Unlike yesterday's decision to make the 
confidence motion contingent on a possible framework agreement 
between the government and the political forces, today's 
decision is only related to the government's programme for the 
highlights of its performance until early September. 
  "There are contradictions between the positions of the 
different political forces, the trade unions and the workforces, 
opposing views clash on crucial matters: privatization, the 
possible closure of separate money-losing branches or 
state-owned enterprises, the reform of health care and 
agriculture, demands for compensations for the shock price rises 
in April, and the level of pay in the public sector," the 
government says in its reasoning which was read to reporters by 
Mr. Raykov. According to the cabinet, "these contradictions 
escalate social tensions and hold back progress, eliminating the 
possibility of achieving durable public concord on most 
disputes. The prevailing view in society is that these 
contradictions virtually block socio-political life and they can 
only be reconciled on the basis of early parliamentary elections 
as soon as possible," the reasoning reads. 
  "A change of government at this point (...) may push the 
country into one degree or another of social and economic 
chaos," the cabinet believes. According to the government, one 
reasonable way out of the situation is transition to a targeted 
government, limited in its life and assignments, which should 
ensure social peace as a prerequisite for normal elections. 
This government, while preserving its non-partisan and expert 
character, undertakes to tackle, along with its current 
business, the country's urgent tasks, to provide reasonable 
compensation to the socially disadvantaged strata who have been 
affected by the price shock, to carry on the land reform and 
privatization, to counter further speculative price rises, and 
to complete the settlement of the country's foreign debt 
problem. The government guarantees that in the months remaining 
until the elections it will not give campaign advantages to any 
party or movement. 
  The leadership of the parliamentary group of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party alone came to a meeting to which Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov invited the parliamentary forces supporting his 
government. The idea of the meeting was to consider the 
framework political agreement and the programme for the 
cabinet's performance highlights until the beginning of 
September. The meeting was attended, in an observer capacity, 
by Mr. Vedat Sakalu MP of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms (DPS), on whose mandate the incumbent cabinet was 
formed. Mr. Sakalu confirmed the position which the movement 
announced yesterday that it will join the agreement only if it 
is supported by at least four parliamentary groups, it emerged 
after the meeting. DPS leader Ahmed Dogan said on national 
radio today that there is no framework agreement. For the time 
being, the BSP alone remains firmly committed to its support for 
the cabinet. The Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) will vote 
against when the confidence motion is put to the vote. SDS 
leader Filip Dimitrov today said that for six days now the 
government has "usurped" power, after last week parliament voted 
down a set of structural and personnel cabinet changes proposed 
by the prime minister. It is not clear how the New Union for 
Democracy and the independents will vote, as their MP's are 
divided over the issue.

<F P=106> [Report by Edaterina Kazasova] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sofia, May 26 (BTA) -- The National Assembly 
voted 125 to 95 for the confidence motion proposed by the 
Council of Ministers, thus backing its newly proposed programme. 
Under the Constitution the government needed the votes of half 
of the MPs present (today 221 MPs took part in the ballot). 
  "I guess one is supposed to say `thank you' in a situation 
like this, but I don't think those who voted against me feel 
envy for my mission," Prime Minister Lyuben Berov said after the 
ballot. He promised to make great efforts to keep the state on 
an even keel. [passage omitted] 
  The MPs opted for a secret ballot. Although SDS [Union of 
Democratic Forces] and the independent MPs insisted on an open, 
roll-call ballot, the secret ballot got 125 votes. 
  The procedure was delayed more than an hour by the 
continuing 
consultations between the prime minister and the political 
forces. Just before the ballot he met with representatives of 
the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms], the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] and NSDP [New Social Democratic Party]. The 
government asked that its normal operation be guaranteed for a 
period of three months, said the spokesman for the DPS, Mr. 
Yunal Lyutfi. He reiterated DPS's support for the cabinet. 
After two meetings with the prime minister the Socialists who 
until then had firmly backed the cabinet felt somewhat 
hesitatnt. BSP leaders Zhan Videnov and Nora Ananieva asked 
from the prime minister too firm guarantees regarding incomes 
compensations, the Government's Spokesman Raicho Raikov 
explained. "They are impossible because of the conditions set 
by the international institutions and G-24," he said. After its 
meeting with the prime minister the parliamentary BSP held a 
long conference at which the MPs were not quite unanimous as to 
the support for the cabinet. 
  The New Policy Center, the Alternative Social Liberal Party 
and the Alliance for Democracy issued a joint declaration that 
they would not support the cabinet. Neither did the SDS. 
  Mr Vassil Gotsev, MP of the SDS, described the ballot as 
"just another farce". He accused DPS leader Ahmed Dogan of 
voting as instructed by Russia's Ambassador Alexander Avdeev. 
Mr Dogan met with Mr Avdeev today and with U.S. Ambassador 
William Montgomery yesterday. "We cannot help asking why Prime 
Minister Berov asked for confidence only until September," Mr 
Gotsev added. Meanwhile, Alexander Lilov of BSP told the 
national radio that early elections will be held this fall and 
that they will be won by the BSP. 
  MP from the New Union for Democracy and representatives of 
the Democratic Bulgaria Union intend to propose a draft 
agreement to the other parliamentary forces to regulate the work 
of parliament until the new elections. They explained that 
parliament and the other state institutions have lost much of 
their prestige. However, jurists from different parliamentary 
forces say that under the Constitution early elections can only 
be held in case of cabinet crisis and the inability of 
parliament to appoint a government.

<F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Drumeva] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sofia, May 26 (BTA) -- Bulgarian journalism has 
turned 150 years. It emerged in 1844 with the coming out of the 
Lyuboslovie journal of Renaissance man Konstantin Fotinov, 
published in Bulgarian while this country was still under 
Ottoman oppression. [passage omitted] 
  Today, four years after the outset of the democratic changes 
in this country, politicians are unanimous that the press and 
speech now enjoy the freedom they have a right to. Last year 
saw over 800 periodicals which circulated a total of 600,000 to 
700,000 copies, according to figures of the Rodina publishers, 
which prints the bulk of the periodicals in this country. A 
national representative survey of Gallup International found 
that the press now has a daily readership of some 2-3 million 
Bulgarians (of an 8 million population). 
  The control over media is now in the limelight of Bulgarian 
journalism. The three national media -- the National Radio, the 
National TV and the Bulgarian News Agency (BTA) -- are now under 
the control of a parliamentary committee. For two years now 
radio and television have been working under a 
parliament-approved interim statute which places certain 
restrictions on the coverage of political processes and events 
in this country. The radio and TV bosses, too, are appointed by 
parliament. Sometimes, this stirs up heated controversies 
pertaining to the freedom of these institutions, as was the case 
with the dismissal of National TV boss Asen Agov and BTA 
Director General Ivo Indzhev by a restructured parliament. The 
rivalry between the political forces for control over the 
electronic media is most manifest during pre-election campaigns, 
when a special scheme for covering the activities of the 
different parties enters into effect. According to researchers, 
the electronic media shapes the public opinion more easily than 
the press and the public confidence it enjoys is greater. 
  Private radio stations hit Bulgaria's airwaves more than an 
year ago but they broadcast in the FM frequency range and do not 
cover the whole of this country's territory. 
  The 24 CHASA daily boasts the highest press run. This daily 
is published by the 168 Chasa Press Group, which is close to 
businessman Valentin Mollov's economic grouping. With its first 
issue that came out four years ago, it claimed its market niche 
and its circulation now is way ahead of the other dailies. The 
March 1994 figures of the Rodina publishers show it comes out in 
250,000 copies per day. 
  The second most read daily is DUMA, the daily of the 
Socialist Party and heir to the ex-Communists' RABOTNICHESKO 
DELO, which runs in about 110,000 copies a day. The 
DEMOKRATSIYA daily of the anti-communist Union of the Democratic 
Forces (SDS), which circulates a total of about 80,000 copies a 
day, comes immediately after. 
  The past couple of years saw a number of new periodicals, 
most of which claim to be independent while being financed by 
influential economic and financial formations. One of them is 
STANDART NEWS, fourth in the list of dailies with a press-run of 
about 70,000 copies, which is financed by the Tron economic 
group. NOVINAR ranks sixth with about 63,000 copies a day, and 
KONTINENT ninth with 16,000 copies. These dailies, as well as 
the 168 CHASA publications, often come under fire of the SDS 
which attack them for their links with financial groupings 
running on capital with suspicious origin. SDS leader Filip 
Dimitrov labels them as "yellow," for carrying information only 
to be later disproved, and "pink," for their subscription to the 
stance of the former Communists. 
  TRUD and OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK were the only old-times dailies 
that survived the collapse of the communist regime. The former, 
once the daily of the official trade unions, is now private and 
close to one of Bulgaria's major labour organization, the 
Confederation of the Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria. TRUD 
comes out in about 70,000 copies, and OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK in 
20,000.

<F P=106> [Report by Mariyana Barutchieva: "Bulgaria Receives Offers </F>
for Deal on 88 Percent of Its London Club Debt"] 
  [Text] Sofia, May 26 (BTA) -- Bulgaria has received offers 
from the London Club banks for settlement of 88 percent of its 
foreign commercial debt, Deputy Finance Minister Dimitur Kostov 
told BTA. Mr. Kostov is member of the Foreign Debt Management 
Committee which is in charge of negotiations with Bulgaria's 
Bank Advisory Committee. The remaining 15 banks are also 
expected to apply for participation in the deal. Among them are 
big Russian banks, to which Bulgaria owes 6.4 percent of the 
$8,700 million debt. According to Mr. Kostov, the proportion of 
banks that have applied for participation in the deal is very 
good, considering that deals of that kind can be finalized even 
when offers cover 80 percent of the debt. He said that German 
and Japanese banks hold the largest portions of the debt. 
  Within the 88 percent portion offered for settlement, 12.8 
percent is for debt buy-back, 27.8 percent for front-loaded 
interest reduction bonds, and 59.4 percent for collateralized 
discount bonds. Bulgaria's actual expenses on the deal cannot be 
calculated at this stage as the interest for the September 
1992-June 1994 period, which will not be capitalized, is still 
to be set and the $180 million which Bulgaria has paid so far 
(about $90 million under Filip Dimitrov's government, $30 
million at the end of 1993, and another $60 million which 
Bulgaria is still to pay for the first half of 1994) are to be 
deducted from the total amount. 
  According to Mr. Kostov, the finalization of the deal is of 
major importance for Bulgaria as it expects foreign banks to 
open credit lines amounting to some $250 million-300 million 
within three to six months after the agreement is signed. This 
will boost Bulgarian companies' sales and output by about 10 
percent and will help create more jobs and raise wages. 
Bulgarian production and trade have been declining in the last 
few years, dropping 4-5 percent in the second half of 1993 
alone, Mr. Kostov said. 
  The total reduction of the debt and its servicing will be an 
estimated 47-50 percent, and that of its par value 37-40 
percent. Between 1994 and 2000, Bulgaria will make annual 
payments of $250 million on the average and will spend $945 
million on buy-back of principal and interest. 
  Bulgaria will pay up front some $670-700 million. In Mr. 
Kostov's view, the country is in position to finance the deal as 
it has a foreign exchange reserves of more than $1,000 million 
at its central bank. Within two months it will also receive 
money from Japan on the SAL agreement and funds for the deal 
promised by international financial institutions, the IMF and 
the World Bank. A total of $250-300 million in extra funding is 
expected, Mr. Kostov said. 
  The debt buy-back will start as soon as the deal is 
finalized 
on June 30, when it will be signed and the up-front payment 
made. The Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank will be discharged of 
its obligation as the nominal debtor on the day of the first 
payment. The newly issued bonds will be traded freely and will 
be registered on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. According to 
Mr. Kostov, futures deals on debt bonds have already been made. 
He said that the debt agency may be assumed by any reputable 
Bulgarian or foreign banking institution which would boost 
confidence in the Bulgarian foreign debt bonds on the secondary 
debt market.

  [Text] Prague, May 24 (CTK) -- Defense Minister Antonin 
Baudys said today it had not yet been proved that there were 
officers in the Czech Army who did collaborate with the former 
communist state police (StB). In an interview with CTK Baudys 
thus reacted to a statement by parliamentary Deputy Tomas Fejfar 
who said that Baudys had confirmed that the lustration or 
screening law had been violated in the army in the case of at 
least two high-ranking officers. 
  Baudys told CTK that both he and Fejfar had been separately 
briefed on the "suspicion that there are officers in the army 
who though being found to have collaborated with StB were 
granted positive or clear lustration certificates. "I have 
ordered the checking of all documents concerning the lustration 
law and nothing of the kind had thus far been proved," Baudys 
said. 
  Nova television, which today broadcast an interview with 
Fejfar, reported on Monday that the lustration law was being 
grossly violated in the Czech Army High Command and that 
positively lust rated officers produce negative lustration 
certificates.

  [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- Interior Minister Jan Ruml 
says in an interview for today's left-leaning RUDE PRAVO that he 
knows for certain that General Karel Pezl, former head of the 
Czech Army's General Staff and now an adviser to Defense 
Minister Antonin Baudys, has a clean screening (lustration) 
certificate. Ruml said he believed that the result of the 
screening of General Rostislav Kotil, head of the South sector 
of the UNPROFOR forces in Croatia, would be the same. 
  He was reacting to recent media allegations that both 
generals had failed the screening tests which must be taken by 
all persons in or entering high office to see if they had 
collaborated with or been an agent of the former communist 
secret police. These allegations were confirmed by Tomas Fejfar 
(ODS), deputy chairman of parliament's defense and security 
committee, on May 24, but Baudys does not agree. 
  Ruml also confirmed that Baudys had taken an interest in the 
results of Pezl's test. He said it had not yet been shown that 
officers who failed their screening tests were working in the 
army. "I have ordered a new inspection of all the documents 
concerning the screening law to be carried out, and nothing like 
this has been shown yet," Ruml told CTK on May 24.

  [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- The Czech Army Command is 
not trying to gloss over slack Army discipline, Czech Defense 
Minister Antonin Baudys said in a statement today, responding to 
a deputy. A blueprint for tightening Army discipline would be 
ready by June 30, Baudys says in the statement. 
  Fifty-six percent of offenses committed by ordinary soldiers 
break military codes, the statement reads, listing desertion, 
disregard of the leave deadline, bullying and non-observance of 
patrol and supervision duties as the most common violations. 
  The overall state of society is the most powerful single 
factor influencing army discipline, Baudys says. Some blame 
lies with officers and staffs but it is mostly non-commissioned 
officers who have low standards of behavior and work, setting 
the privates a bad example and even inciting trouble. 
  The standards of common soldiers worsen over the time 
served. 
The longer-serving soldiers have a negative attitude to service, 
Baudys says. Broad measures involving civilian consulting 
bodies will have to be adopted to stamp out bullying, the 
statement reads.

  [Text] Bratislava May 24 (CTK) -- Egyutteles Party 
Chairman Miklos Duray said he had discussed the need to solve 
the bilateral relations of post-communist countries with the 
government but found its attitude to the problem no less 
"distressing" than the previous government. 
  "We will make one last attempt in the framework of the 
coalition," Duray said at a press conference today. If they are 
unsuccessful the party will probably issue a statement asking 
the international community to take account of their requests, 
he said. Egyutteles is the largest party in Slovakia, 
representing the half a million members of the Hungarian 
minority. 
  In Duray's view, the stability pact, proposed by French 
Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur, should also resolve the problems of 
minorities. Bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries 
should address the problem and legitimate representatives of 
minorities should participate in the negotiations, he said. The 
status of minorities should be defined in a definitive bilateral 
agreement, such as exists between Austria and Italy in the case 
of the South Tyrolean minority. 
  The Hungarian politicians are requesting that Bratislava 
grant collective rights to the Hungarian community in Slovakia 
but the government refuses, preferring that individual rights be 
accorded to them as to all other citizens. 
  The stability pact envisages the signing of bilateral 
agreements between countries, but this aspect has been rejected 
by certain politicians in Slovakia and Romania, Duray said. 
  The pact is an elaboration of the original Balladur plan of 
last September, and stems from Western fears that the tragedy of 
Yugoslavia may be repeated in other countries of the former 
communist bloc. It is designed to prevent international 
disputes over national minorities and joint borders. European 
countries begin to debate the adoption of the pact in Paris on 
Thursday [26 May].

  [Text] Prague, May 25 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today 
approved legal measures aimed at transferring state-owned real 
estate to the ownership of the Federation of Jewish Communities 
and Jewish Religious Communities, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
told journalists after a cabinet meeting. 
  Individual ministries ought to submit their proposals for 
specific transfers to the Finance Ministry for definitive 
approval by June 15, Klaus said. The State Jewish Museum makes 
an exclusion since in its case, given the complicated nature of 
the transfer, a proposal should be submitted only in September, 
he added. 
  Klaus confirmed that all the transfers would be implemented 
in the form of a gift-given agreement according to the Civil 
Code.

  [Text] Prague, May 24 (CTK) -- "In no case will our party 
repeat the mistakes of former years, and it is undoubtedly far 
from glorifying the period before 1989 (the fall of the 
communist regime in Czechoslovakia)," Zdenek Klanica, deputy 
chairman of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) 
says in an interview published by RUDE PRAVO today. 
  By its gradual shifting to more and more radical statements, 
the KSCM does not intend to return to the past, but only to 
"defend the honest labor of millions of people", and react to 
the complicated economic situation in the country, he stresses 
in the left-leaning daily. "The situation differs from that of 
the pre-revolutionary period, and therefore the solution to it 
differs as well," he adds. 
  The management of the Czech economy is poor, Klanica states, 
pointing to its "catastrophic decline" since 1989 in comparison 
with European Union member countries. Klanica says he believes 
that "It is erroneous to link a planned economy -- I am omitting 
the adjective 'central' -- only to the communist method of 
directing the national economy. Strategic planning, though not 
to the last details, is necessary. Even big world concern 
practice planning, and it was a great mistake when some less 
educated politicians abolished planning in their post-November 
(1989) euphoria, arguing that it was linked to communism," 
Klanica says. 
  Referring to the People's Union for National and Social 
Salvage (LUNSZ), a left-wing organization of former KSCM member 
and pre- revolution communist hardliner Miroslav Stepan, Klanica 
says that LUNSZ is trying to "split the KSCM from the left", 
after former communists Josef Mecl and Jaroslav Ortman, now 
leaders of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) and the Left Bloc 
Party (SLB), the entities including mainly former KSCM members, 
"failed to disintegrate it from the right". 
  "We are against any further fragmentation of the KSCM, as it 
would weaken its political force," Klanica adds. 
  Asked whether or not he believed his party would win the 
elections, as had left-wing forces in Poland and Hungary, 
Klanica stresses that neither in Hungary nor in Poland was the 
"communist tradition as strong as in the Czech Lands even before 
1989". "The Czechs have a very strong sense of history," he 
states, adding that it was probably not so strong in Hungarian 
and Polish workers' and socialist parties. Asked why Slovakia's 
Democratic Left Party (SDL), the former Slovak communist party, 
which reformed itself into a social democratic type of party, is 
doing far better in the Slovak polls than the KSCM, although the 
"tradition" was not as strong in Slovakia as in the Czech 
Republic, Klanica says that public opinion polls are unreliable 
and misleading because they do not poll enough people. "I 
believe that the KSCM will gain 14 percent of the vote at least 
in the elections, as many people have already found out who is 
lying to them and who tells the truth," he says. 
  Klanica points out that before the last, June 1992 elections 
the KSCM had only 7 percent in the polls (while the Left Bloc 
coalition bloc, made up practically of KSCM members, received 14 
percent of the vote in the elections). "It was because people 
were afraid to express their opinion. Today their fear of our 
'democracy' is even bigger," he insists. 
  Local elections in the Czech Republic are to be held this 
autumn, parliamentary elections in 1996, the date of the 
elections to the Senate, the still non-existent upper chamber of 
the Czech parliament, is yet to be set. In the latest polls, 
the KSCM received about 10 percent. 
  Klanica also comments on the drop of the number of KSCM 
members from about 350,000 to 220,000 within the past year. The 
party's transformation and the adaption to different social 
conditions has naturally been reflected in its membership, he 
says, adding that now (former) communists are members of all 
political parties and holding all types of political posts. 
"Simply because there used to be many of them -- 1.7 million -- 
and they were capable, they found their places very well," 
Klanica says. 
  He stresses that the KSCM is willing to cooperate with the 
SDL and the SLB, and within the whole opposition. He describes 
is as nonsense that the opposition forces do not cooperate, 
blaming each other for "too left-wing" positions.

  [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
issued a communique today expressing concern over rising tension 
in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and the hope that it is solved by 
political means without compromising Ukraine's territorial 
integrity. The sovereignty of Ukraine, to which Crimea has 
belonged since the 1956, and internal stability in the region 
are of paramount importance for peace and normal developments in 
Eastern Europe, the statement reads. 
  In its bilateral relations with Ukraine the Czech Republic 
seeks to support and strengthen the democratic system and the 
transition to a market economy in Ukraine, it says. 
  Russian-Ukrainian talks are currently underway on sharing 
the 
Black Sea Fleet and defusing tension over the Crimea. The 
political leadership of Crimea last week adopted a new 
constitution loosening ties with Kiev and moving towards 
realignment with Russia. There is a sizable Russian majority in 
Crimea, which was formerly administered by Russia.

  [Text] Prague, May 25 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec said today that a two-day conference on the 
stability pact, which opens in Paris tomorrow, will be the 
culmination of many months of effort by diplomats from France 
and the countries applying for European Union (EU) membership. 
  He told reporters prior to his departure for Paris that he 
hoped that the conference would start a process "leading to 
greater understanding between the states in central and Eastern 
Europe, and also in their relation to the EU." Zieleniec said 
he did not expect any document to be signed in Paris, as the 
conference, he said, would rather be a political event. 
Zieleniec expressed satisfaction with all the texts prepared 
for the conference, as they now reflect consensus in France, the 
EU but also in the associated countries. 
  The stability pact will not lead to the creation of new 
international institutions, but will start a process which will 
(naturally) become part of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) process, Zieleniec said.

  [Text] Prague, May 25 (CTK) -- "For the Czech Republic 
relations with Germany are extremely important, as is promoting 
dialogue on all questions. What we oppose to are talks between 
a grouping and the Czech Government," Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec told journalists today. 
  He said the Czech Republic's stand towards the Sudeten 
German 
question is "clear and does not ensue from its relation to 
Germany but from the international and legal nature of the 
problem." 
  The "Four Plus Two" treaty on Germany's unification 
essentially substitutes a peace treaty from the view point of 
the Allies, Zieleniec said, when asked what prevents the Czech 
Republic from concluding a peace treaty with Germany.

  [Text] Prague, May 25 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec today confirmed that former 
Chilian dictator Augusto Pinochet, currently the commander of 
the Chilean ground troops, would indeed come to the Czech 
Republic. At the same time they distanced themselves from his 
visit. 
  Zieleniec said today that Pinochet's visit had nothing to do 
either with the Czech Government or with Czech authorities. He 
said a Chilean delegation is touring European countries to study 
the possibilities of military equipment purchases. The 
delegation is to come to the Czech Republic at the invitation of 
a commercial firm trading in arms. "There will be no contacts 
between Czech Government representatives and this delegation," 
Zieleniec told journalists. 
  Zieleniec did not specify the firm which had invited the 
Chilean delegation. According to diplomatic sources it is the 
Omnipol joint stock company. The same sources told CTK that 
Pinochet would come to the Czech Republic on Monday [30 May] to 
stay for three days. CTK failed to contact Omnipol's 
representatives today. 
  The Chilean Foreign Ministry today officially confirmed that 
Pinochet would visit some European countries including the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia. It refused, however, due to security 
reasons, to give any details about his trip, including the date 
of his departure and the precise number of the countries he 
intends to visit. 
  Klaus told journalists the visit would take place "at the 
invitation of our firms. Not to Pinochet but to a Chilean 
military delegation which is coming to several European 
countries, including the Czech Republic, to buy some equipment." 
"As far as I know it is an exclusively private visit which is 
not being organized by any Czech state institution," Klaus said. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vit Kurfurst told CTK that the 
ministry had not invited Pinochet and had not participated in 
the preparation of his programme.

  [Text] Ostrava, North Moravia, May 26 (CTK) -- Czech 
Premier Vaclav Klaus today rejected a statement by Defense 
Minister Antonin Baudys who allegedly said on Wednesday in 
Brussels that a visit of former Chilean dictator and the current 
commander of the Chilean ground forces Augusto Pinochet to the 
Czech Republic "actually ensues from Klaus' visit to Chile." 
"Minister Baudys could not have said this. It is pure 
nonsense, a lie. If Mr.Baudys did say this then it is 
absolutely absurd and meaningless sentence," Klaus told

  On Wednesday Baudys told CTK in Brussels that Pinochet's 
planned visit to the Czech Republic was not an official one, a 
visit "on a political level and a visit on the purely working 
and trade level." "It actually ensues from Klaus' visit who in 
Chile also spoke about mutual trade contacts. It is an 
exclusively working and commercial matter and it has no 
political background," he said. 
  Neither the government nor any government official has 
talked 
about the visit or organized it," Klaus said. "I cannot 
therefore speak on behalf of the cabinet. This visit which is 
more or less a visit aimed at looking for orders for the Chilean 
army is a matter which does not directly concern the government 
at all, he added. 
  Klaus pointed out that he did not see any reason for banning 
the sale of Czech armaments to Chile or Czech private firms' 
deals with Chile, which currently meets all democratic criteria.

  [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- Chairman of the 
Parliamentary Defense and Security Committee Vladimir Suman 
today told CTK that given that the expected visit of Augusto 
Pinochet to the Czech Republic was a private one he saw no 
reason why it should be a subject of his interest. 
  Regarding the information that Pinochet wants to study Czech 
products, equipment and technology which could be of interest to 
the Chilean Armed Forces Suman said that a very tough law 
concerning the sale, exports, imports and transit of arms was 
passed in the Czech Republic at the beginning of the year and 
this law contains clear regulations on granting permission for 
arms trade. Suman said that the law guaranteed that armaments 
not to be sent to such places of final destination which are 
considered risky from the point of view of relevant resolutions 
of the United Nations. 
  Jiri Payne, chairman of the parliamentary foreign affairs 
committee, told CTK today that the law on foreign trade with 
military material introduces the two-level control of each 
contact. 
  Commercial director of the Omnipol joint stock company 
Frantisek Kurka today told CTK that Omnipol intended to make use 
of Pinochet's visit for discussing the possibility of selling 
Czech military equipment to Chile. 
  Pointing to the law on foreign trade with military material 
Payne said that if Omnipol obtained a permit for trade with the 
Chilean side then everything would be all right. "We can be only 
interested in whether and how the law is observed," he said, 
noting that the Chilean delegation headed by Pinochet would come 
to the Czech Republic at the invitation of a private firm. 
  Kurka today told CTK that Omnipol had invited a trade 
delegation from the Chilean ground forces commercial department 
to come to the Czech Republic. He said that it was the Chilean 
side which put Pinochet at the head of the delegation and 
Omnipol had accepted it. Pinochet is currently high commander of 
the Chilean ground forces.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Central European Initiative: Prague </F>
Wants More Concrete Projects, Less Diplomacy"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Prague, May 25 -- The Central European 
Initiative (CEI) should focus more on concrete actions in the 
areas of economic and technical cooperation and less on 
aspirations to become a forum to resolve bilateral, security, 
ethnic and border questions, Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel 
Bratinka told ANSA on the eve of his visit to Italy. 
  Bratinka, who will be in Italy Thursday [26 May] and Friday, 
argued that a sufficient number of institutions and forums 
existed to tackle bilateral and other questions, while the CEI, 
of which Italy is a founding member, should be used to 
coordinate regional development potential through concrete 
projects, for example, in the areas of transport and 
telecommunications. 
  A positive example of this, the Czech diplomat said, was the 
effort currently underway to create a Central European Free 
Trade Association (CEFTA) and added how the CEI should be 
expanded to include other countries in Central and Eastern 
Europe but, at the same not, not become institutionalized. 
  The Czech deputy foreign minister went on to state how 
Italy's presence in the CEI was an "utmost priority" and how, 
for his country, there was great appreciation for the potential 
for cooperation with Italy and for Rome's role as "our lawyer" 
before the European Union [EU]. 
  Evidence of this, Bratinka added, was last year's 
Italo-British initiative in favor of initiating a cooperation 
policy between the European Union and countries in Central and 
Eastern Europe. 
  In this framework, the Czech diplomat urged a greater 
presence of Italian investments in his country -- they currently 
account for 3.4 percent of total foreign investment -- observing 
"I expect Italy's share to rise to 10 percent", given the 
"golden opportunities" which await Italian investors in the 
Czech Republic. 
  During his two-day visit to Italy, Czech deputy foreign 
minister will review, with his Italian talking partners, a whole 
range of questions, including bilateral treaties, Italy's 
ratification of the EU association agreement with the Czech 
Republic, the situation in the former Yugoslavia, United Nations 
questions, NATO's "Partnerships for Peace" initiative and the 
nomination of a new Czech ambassador to Rome, a post left open 
for some time now. 
  The CEI was born from the original "Quadrilateral 
Initiative", formed in 1989 between Italy, Austria, Hungary and 
the then Yugoslavia. It was then expanded to include 
Czechoslovakia and later Poland, thus becoming the "Pentagonal" 
and "Hexagonal" initiatives. 
  Between 1992 and 1993, following the division of Yugoslavia 
and Czechoslovakia, the initiative's membership rose to ten -- 
with the admission of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, 
Slovenia and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- and it 
became the Central European Initiative.

  [Text] Budapest, 26 May (MTI) -- Five of the six parties 
that qualified themselves for the next parliament in the first 
round of the general elections on May 8 have published electoral 
manifestos for the May 29 second round, urging all eligible 
voters to turn out for the vote. 
  Such manifestos have been published by the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP), the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the Independent 
Smallholders Party (FKGP), and the Christian Democratic People's 
Party (KDNP). The sixth parliamentary party, the Federation of 
Young Democrats (Fidesz), did not disclose such a document. 
  The MSZP, front-runners in the elections with 32.96 percent 
of party list votes, states in its manifesto, "on May 8 
Hungarians voted for a change and a new government because the 
right-wing coalition failed to properly utilize the 
authorization it received four years ago. The coalition was 
unable to solve the country's economic problems, which were 
aggravated over the past few years. 
  "The MSZP champions social peace and general consensus, and 
strives to form a coalition government. It is convinced that 
the governing parties should implement their programs and fulfil 
their promises as equal partners. To this effect, the 
Socialists are prepared to accept all reasonable compromises. 
They propose continuous coordination and cooperation between 
the next government, and the employer and employee organizations 
to lead the country out of the crisis," the manifesto says. 
  The Alliance of Free Democrats, which finished in the first 
round in second place, with 19.76 percent of party list votes, 
says in its manifesto, "the SZDSZ presses for a multi-party 
government to be formed whose policy attracts all political 
forces committed to civil democratic values and helps form 
balanced political power relations. 
  "Should the party's prime ministerial candidate Gabor Kuncze 
be in the position to form a government, expertise may come to 
power. The Free Democrats wish to put an end to squabbling and 
to the political and emotional division of society. The SZDSZ 
is a centrist party which is able to integrate differing 
interests. The Free Democrats wish to eliminate corruption and 
lavish central spending in order to boost economic growth, 
create new jobs, and guarantee independence of the press, 
education and churches." 
  The Hungarian Democratic Forum, the senior governing 
coalition party which won 11.73 percent of party list votes in 
the first round, says in its manifesto, "on May 8 the majority 
of voters decided that the MDF should play the role of 
parliamentary opposition during the next four years. The stake 
of the second round is whether the MDF will be in a strong or a 
formal oppositional position. Preparing for the role of the 
strongest opposition party, the MDF seeks to preserve the values 
and results created in the past four years, and represent the 
interests of those who received compensation for their past 
grievances and those who acquired property, to ensure that 
private property should not be threatened in the future by 
nationalization or expropriation." 
  The Independent Smallholders Party, which received 8.85 
percent of votes cast for party lists in the first round of 
elections on May 8, puts down its aims in the following points: 
No more policy seeking to exploit the people; humanity, 
security of existence, legal security; a pact-free policy 
resting on national bases, democracy based on guarantees; a 
president of the republic directly elected by the people; an 
unbiased and authentic press, radio and television committed to 
the nation; a Hungary free from corruption and mafias; education 
based on Christian morals, universal values, and domestic 
intellectual traditions. 
  According to the FKGP's appeal, Hungary's economic and 
cultural renewal may only begin when it is also possible for the 
smallest village to develop. 
  The document stresses crossable borders instead of border 
disputes, as well as peaceful political diplomacy between 
Carpathian nations. 
  The Christian Democratic People's Party, with 7.06 percent 
of 
party list votes, points out in its appeal: Most electors going 
to the polls in the first round of this year's parliamentary 
elections decided not to choose the current ruling coalition but 
the opposition parties whose situation is easier and can, 
therefore, promise more. 
  Quoting successes achieved by European Christian Democratic 
parties over the past 50 years in setting up social market 
economies, the KDNP says this is the only road that can lead to 
Hungary's economic, social and cultural rise. 
  The second round of elections will decide whether Parliament 
continues with balanced power relations, and whether the 
opposition is able to exercise effective control over the ruling 
parties. This can be ensured by Conservative-Christian forces 
over the next four years, the KDNP appeal states.

  [Text] Budapest, 26 May (MTI) -- "The next government -- 
whether a coalition or not -- should strive to create social 
peace, which can best be done if balanced power relations evolve 
as a result of the parliamentary elections," Gabor Fodor, ranked 
second on the national election list of the Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ), told a news conference in Budapest on 
Thursday. 
  The SZDSZ does not approve of a single party determining the 
work of the next parliament instead of a sensible compromise 
between various political parties, as compromises always have 
greater social support than the decisions of one party, Fodor 
said. 
  SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar stated that electors will 
determine what coalition opportunities exist after the second 
round of voting on May 29, and whether the balance of different 
political forces will be ensured within the new government. 
  The SZDSZ is aware that the country needs a balanced 
government which is able to put an end to social division. 
During coalition talks after the run-off elections, the Free 
Democrats will strive to help the emergence of a new government 
with a large social following, ready to deal with economic 
questions instead of ideological debates.

  [Text] Budapest, 25 May (MTI) -- Economic legislation must 
definitely receive emphasis at the outset of the next 
parliamentary cycle -- this was the unanimous view shared by the 
senior officials of the four parties that scored the best 
results in the first round of the general elections. 
  The roundtable was held at the Budapest University of 
Economics and was attended by Imre Szekeres, acting deputy 
chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), Gabor Kuncze, 
head of the parliamentary group and prime minister candidate of 
the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), Prime Minister Peter 
Boross of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), and Jozsef 
Torgyan, the national chairman of the Independent Smallholders' 
Party (FKGP). 
  With respect to what should be done on the economy, 
participants said privatization should be reconsidered, the 
privatization techniques modified, and a balanced budget ensured. 
  As regards the latter, Kuncze was of the opinion that the 
new 
government will probably have to submit a supplementary budget, 
with the idea of reducing government expenditures. 
  Imre Szekeres said the new cabinet faces "fire 
extinguishing" 
work in the economic sphere. He said a lot depends on how the 
outgoing government deals with handing over the ongoing matters, 
and on how in-depth the analyses and information it provides 
will be. 
  In the discussion of economic issues, Boross said economic 
growth should definitely receive top priority in the future. 
  Szekeres voiced the hope that the new government can be 
formed by the end of June or the beginning of July. 
  In detailing the mechanism of political and coalition 
coordination, the officials of the individual parties set forth 
different views. Peter Boross was of the opinion that a 
constant coordination constraint can easily render government 
work impossible. On the other hand, the senior MSZP and SZDSZ 
politicians considered a coalition agreement to be 
indispensable, and for efficient legislative work they stated 
that they consider it necessary for the six parliamentary 
parties to reach consensus. 
  Szekeres said the Socialists would like to have a coalition 
government. He said that if the MSZP will be in the position to 
ask coalition partners to participate in the government, then 
the parties it can seriously consider, based on similarity in 
principle and policy of the manifestos, are primarily the SZDSZ, 
and secondly the Federation of Young Democrats. 
  The matter of the Hungarian president's authority, and the 
identity of the future president, was also discussed at the 
roundtable. Irrespective of party standing, the politicians 
agreed that the president of the Republic should be a person 
above party politics. 
  Kuncze said the Free Democrats do not wish to alter the 
constitutional-law status of the president. However, they wish 
to make certain authorities more precise. 
  Szekeres said it is conceivable that the position of the 
president will be strengthened, and added that in this case the 
president should be elected by referendum. The representatives 
of both the MSZP and the SZDSZ were of the opinion that Arpad 
Goncz could serve on as president even after 1995.

  [Text] Budapest, 26 May (MTI) -- The Social Democrats have 
a program that offers an alternative to Central and Eastern 
Europe, struggling with the difficulties of transformation. 
Accordingly, Socialist International intends to devote greater 
attention to the region in the future, and it has already 
created successful cooperation with the two Hungarian 
member-groups of the organization, the Hungarian Socialist Party 
(MSZP) and the Social Democratic Party of Hungary. The above 
was stressed by Socialist International (SI) General Secretary 
Luis Ayala at the closing press conference of the organization's 
Central and Eastern European Committee session held in Budapest 
on Thursday [26 May]. The conference was attended by 
representatives of 30 parties. 
  The co-chairman of the committee, Piero Fassino, said that 
the Socialist International Council will hold its next general 
assembly in Budapest in October or November. 
  In answer to a question from the press, the MSZP executive 
in 
charge of foreign affairs, Laszlo Kovacs, said his party does 
not wish to change the priorities of Hungarian foreign policy. 
However, it does wish to devote equal attention to western 
integration, relations with Hungary's neighbors, and enforcing 
the rights of Hungarians living beyond the borders. 
  Kovacs said a pressing task of Hungarian foreign policy is 
reconciliation with the country's neighbors. If the MSZP is 
elected to run the next government, it would focus on empathy 
and initiating readiness to open discussion, rather than 
exerting pressure on the neighbors and exercising attempts at 
slowing down their European integration. 
  The politician also said that the socialists do not consider 
signing basic agreements with neighbors as a goal, but rather as 
a means. They expect these agreements to intensify stability, 
build confidence, and improve the situation of the minorities. 
Basic agreements that include confirmation of borders and 
enforcement of minority rights do not contradict Hungarian 
interests, and this would serve the stability of the region, he 
said.

  [Text] Budapest, 27 May (MTI) -- After examining possible 
complaints and granting legal redresses, the National Electoral 
Committee is to announce the final result of the 1994 
parliamentary elections in 10 to 14 days after the May 29 second 
round, Ilona Palffy, deputy head of the Interior Ministry's 
Electoral Office, told MTI. 
  Under the Constitution, the president of the Republic is to 
convene the founding session of the new parliament in 30 days 
after the elections. The session will mark the end of the 
mandate of the government in office. In the subsequent 40 days, 
parliament will pass a decision on the prime minister candidate 
proposed by the president of the republic and on the program of 
his government, Palffy said. 
  Should the prime minister candidate and his program be 
accepted by a majority of deputies, the new prime minister will 
make proposals for the ministers, who will then be appointed by 
the president. This means that Hungary may have a new 
government by late July, she said.

  [Text] Budapest, 26 May (MTI) -- The Hungarian Government 
has declassified a significant proportion of Council of 
Ministers' documents dating from the years 1944 to 1960. Among 
these are documents filed under the names of the state leaders 
of that period. The overwhelming majority of documents are from 
leaders of the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, and the 
organizational units working under the Secretariat, government 
spokeswoman Judit Juhasz announced at her customary Thursday [26 
May] press briefing. 
  She added that several documents still contain information 
which remains protected for foreign policy or national security 
reasons, or because their publication would violate personal 
rights. The secrecy of these documents will continue to be 
upheld, on the proposal of the committee that reviewed the 
"secret" classification of the documents. 
  In addition, the cabinet decided on Thursday to place an 
addendum on the document on Peace Partnership which clarifies 
that the State Office for Technical Development is in charge of 
scientific affairs among the organizations designated for 
cooperation.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 24/5/1994 -- Members of the 
Foreign Policy Committees of the two chambers of the Romanian 
parliament had talks Tuesday, 24 May, with the Chinese 
parliamentary delegation led by Zhan Yue, member of the 
Permanent Committee of the Chinese People's National Congress, 
vice-president of the Foreign Policy Committee. 
  The topics approached during the talks, which both sides 
described as a "friendly working meeting," were mainly 
concerning the parliamentary relations between Romania and 
China, Romania's relations with the countries in its area, 
primarily with the Republic of Moldova, the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, and the Ukraine, Romania's relations with 
Russia, the situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina, and human rights. 
  Speaking of the reformist process under way in China, Mr. 
Yue 
said this was concurrently taking place in both the economic and 
political spheres. As to the latter, he presented the progress 
made in consolidating democracy in his country, and made a point 
of saying that China would not copy other countries' experience, 
but build its own starting from its specific conditions. 
  Relative to Russia's situation, Mr. Yue said his country 
wished this could improve, and that the Russian-Chinese 
relations were normal. 
  A subject of interest for the Chinese side was Romania's 
position to the situation in former Yugoslavia. Ruling party 
Senator Sergiu Nicolaescu, chairman of the Senate's Foreign 
Policy Committee stressed that the evolution in Yugoslavia 
should be watched most carefully now that "some cherish the 
ambition of restoring the frontiers of pre-war Europe." Nicolae 
Ivanciu Valeanu, chairman of the lower house's Foreign Policy 
Committee, pointed out that Romania does observe the embargo 
ruled against former Yugoslavia, but that the Romanian 
Parliament adopted a statement according to which Romania would 
never, whatever the way, interfere in the conflict. 
  Both sides voiced their hope that the traditional friendly 
relations between Romania and China would consolidate 
irrespective of the changes that might occur in the 
international situation.
