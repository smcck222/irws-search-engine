  [Text] Prague, May 24 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government is 
interested in the "non-standard and privileged relations, in the 
good sense of the words, with the Czech Republic and in good 
communication with Czech trade representatives, Slovak 
parliament Deputy Chairman Peter Weiss said today. [no closing 
quotation mark as received] 
  Speaking at a press conference following his meeting with 
Czech parliament officials and representatives of Czech 
political parties, Weiss said that he had come to the conclusion 
that the time had come to extend, along with regular meetings on 
the governmental level which are being held, direct political 
dialogue between representatives of Slovak and Czech political 
parties. Weiss is chairman of the government coalition 
Democratic Left Party (SDL). 
  Weiss met today with Deputy Premier and Chairman of the 
Coalition Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party 
(KDU-CSL) Josef Lux, the Czech Parliament Deputy Chairmen, 
Executive Deputy Chairman of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) 
Peter Cermak, Deputy Chairmen of the Civic Democratic Alliance 
(ODA) Daniel Kroupa and Libor Kudlacek, Chairman of the Czech 
Social Democratic Party (CSSD) Milos Zeman and Deputy Foreign 
Minister Alexandr Vondra. 
  Weiss said that the meeting were interesting and frank and 
he 
was satisfied with his visit to the Czech Republic. "I have 
become convinced that there is the space and the will for 
dialogue between our independent republics to extend," he said. 
  He described the CSSD as the SDL's naturally closest 
partner. 
"We are interested in cooperation with Czech Social Democrats," 
Weiss said, adding that both political parties intend to 
cooperate with social democratically-orientated parties in the 
Visegrad group countries (Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Poland). 
  Commenting on his one-hour talk with Zeman, Weiss said that 
the SDL and CSSD wanted the trend visible in Poland and Hungary 
-- the shift of the political focus to the social 
democratically-orientated parties -- to establish itself also in 
the Czech Republic in two years. 
  "We joked, not only with Zeman, but also with Cermak and ODA 
representatives that the current Czech Government is actually 
pursuing, in many aspects, a pragmatic social democratically- 
orientated policy, though using different outward rhetoric," 
Weiss said. 
  The difference in the political orientation of the governing 
parties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia could not be an 
obstacle to mutual relations if basic rules of democracy are 
respected, Weiss said, adding that for him the most important is 
a good political will and greater pragmatism. 
  Weiss's meeting with Vondra focused on what prevents 
relations between the two republics from expanding and on the 
questions concerning internal political situation in the Czech 
Republic and of how the new Slovak Government is accepted in the 
Czech Republic, Weiss told CTK. 
  During a working lunch with the parliament deputy chairmen 
the preparation of the new procedural rules of both parliaments 
was discussed. It was agreed that the two parliaments would 
exchange draft rules, Weiss said.

Human Rights Fund, with its seat in Belgrade, Natasha Kandic, 
was received in Prishtina by the members of the presidency of 
DLK [Kosova Democratic Alliance], Chairman Dr. Fehmi Agani, 
deputy chairman, Edita Tahiri, and other members, who spoke 
about the grave situation in Kosova, as a result of Serb state 
organized oppression. The presidency of DLK presented to her 
the attitude, already known for the solution of Kosova issue, by 
peaceful means and through a referendum. 
  The chairman of the fund said that the organization is 
closely following the developments in Kosova, and added that she 
is compiling a special report for the situation in Kosova. She 
expressed her respect for the Albanians, who with their peaceful

continuous repression, Albanian people showed maturity and did 
not react to the provocations conducted by the Serb's regime, 
avoiding so the war.

  [Text] Prishtina, May 24 (ATA) -- In an interview with 
Behlul Jashari, ATA correspondent, on May 23, the rector of the 
Prishtina University, Prof. Dr. Ejup Statovci, said that the 
closing of the University of Prishtina by the Serbian 
authorities aims at preventing studies in the Albanian language. 
To this end, Serbian authorities have occupied the university 
premises through force, by not allowing over 900 teachers and 
over 20 thousand Albanian students to attend studies there. 
  According to Mr. Statovci, Albanian teachers and students 
have not interrupted teaching. The classes are being held, for 
the third consecutive year, in private homes in very difficult 
conditions. Almost the whole Prishtina is turned into a 
university. Despite the conditions, work goes on for the 
modernization of the teaching process. A law has also been 
prepared for the university based on the experience of the 
universities of Western countries. 
  Mr. Statovci said that they have good relations with the 
universities in Albania, particularly with the Tirana 
University, which has given them a great assistance. According 
to Mr. Statovci, these relations are not developing as they 
should for objective reasons, one of which is the impossible 
free movement of the people.

  [Text] The meeting between [Radical Civic Union, UCR, 
leader] Raul Alfonsin and Cordoba Governor Eduardo Angeloz has 
been postponed because Angeloz changed his plans and will not be 
coming to the federal capital this week. No new date has been 
set for the meeting. 
  Angeloz' spokespersons told LA NACION that his decision 
follows his desire to remain in his province on 29 April because 
state employees will hold a public demonstration. They added 
that Alfonsin flatly rejected the Cordoba Province proposal to 
reorganize the UCR. This proposal includes shortening Alfonsin's 
mandate and calling internal elections to elect a new UCR 
president, a post that the governor of Cordoba wants. 
  Late last night, Alfonsin's highest-ranking spokespersons 
had 
no news about the postponement, which Angeloz decided over the 
weekend. This faux pas shows the seriousness of the internal 
crisis. 
  On 26 April, Alfonsin had a long meeting with Pascual 
Cappelleri, Cesar Jaroslavsky, Marcelo Bassani, and Simon Lazara 
to discuss "administrative matters" of the Constituent Assembly. 
On 29 April, the Justicialist will be asked for a meeting. At 
this meeting, the UCR will demand that the first vice presidency 
of the Constituent Assembly be given to one of its members. 
  Here is another sign of tension among the people from 
Cordoba: Up to 26 April, the Alfonsin faction stressed this post 
would go to Ramon Mestre, the former mayor of Cordoba City. On 
26 April, after the meeting with Angeloz was postponed, the 
Alfonsin faction announced that nothing had been resolved yet. 
  Mestre is a member of the negotiating commission together 
with Cappelleri, Jaroslavsky, and Bassani. He did not show up on 
26 April at the UCR headquarters to participate in the lengthy 
meeting between Alfonsin and his followers.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero will 
discuss with the economic team the proposal to freeze credit for 
the first three months after the implementation of the new 
currency, the real, as former Minister Mario Henrique Simonsen 
suggested to Minister Ricupero on Sunday 24 April. 
  The economic team has been working with several ideas 
involving the curtailing of credit immediately after the 
implementation of the real. They are concerned, however, about 
the need to prevent people from creating a consumption 
escalation as a result of a sudden drop in the inflation rate, 
because that would cause prices in the new currency to increase. 
The dilemma now is to figure out the population's demand for 
currency. 
  Once the economy is stabilized, there will be a 
remonetization phenomenon, that is, the exchange of money 
invested in certificates for currency. No one knows the volume 
of certificates that will be converted into money. All everyone 
knows is that if demand and supply are big, there will be strong 
inflationary pressure on the recently created currency. Gustavo 
Franco, director of the Central Bank International Area, has 
already warned that the monetary base (currency in the hands of 
the public plus bank reserves) will not double. In February, 
the monetary base totalled 0.6 percent of the GDP. This is 
equivalent to $2.5 billion. 
  Franco added that there will be a significantly tight money 
supply. It must be recalled that the market has invested nearly 
$100 billion in the banks. This money crutch will be enough to 
ensure that only a small portion ends in the pockets of the 
people. 
  To give an idea of the amount of money invested in the 
banks, 
it must be said that more than $20 billion were invested in the 
savings pass books in February. The money invested in private 
certificates totals $30 billion. 
  Before defining the money crutch model to be adopted, the 
team wants to ensure budget balance because without this, it 
will be useless to control credit. The objective is to prevent 
the government from issuing money to finance common expenditures 
of the public machinery and then issue certificates to collect 
this money, thus creating sources for price increases.

<F P=106> [Article by Janice Menezes: "Government-Owned Firms Valued </F>
at $47 Billion"] 
  [Text] The Federal Government's share of the net worth of 
government-owned firms totals $29.6 billion, of which $27.4 
billion represents its holdings in such firms as Petrobras, the 
Rio Doce Valley Company [CVRD], Telebras, Eletrobras, and the 
Federal Railroad Network. But with the expectation of 
privatization, the "blue chips" alone -- mainly Eletrobras -- 
are valued at $47.1 billion on the stock exchange. 
  This means that if the government decided to sell off those 
firms quickly, it would collect enough money to pay off a good 
share of the public debt. But Marina Figueira, professor in the 
Department of Economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of 
Rio de Janeiro and author of a detailed study of Brazilian 
government-owned firms, says that immediate privatization like 
that which has occurred in other Latin American countries would 
not work in Brazil because the structure of federally owned 
firms is much more complex that that of their neighbors. 
  "Chiefly since 1964, the Brazilian state has grown beyond 
the 
public sector. The main economic groups in the government 
productive sector are controlled by mixed-economy companies 
whose owners include partners in the private sector and whose 
shares are traded on the exchange," she says. 
  Blue chips: An example of that limitation on the state's 
ability to divest is precisely the value of its firms in the 
stock market. The fact is that of the total stock market value 
of shares in those blue chip companies (Rio Doce Valley, 
Eletrobras, Telebras, and Petrobras) -- $47.1 billion -- the 
government's share comes to $25.6 billion. So in order to get 
rid of its shares, the government will have to engage in some 
intense negotiations with minority stockholders. 
  Because of that, according to the study by Marina Figueira, 
and unlike what happened in other Latin American countries, 
privatization attempts in Brazil are being preceded by 
innumerable fights over ownership rights. 
  The government-owned firms have become so independent of the 
state that when subsidiaries have been privatized -- Petrobras's 
subsidiaries, for example -- the proceeds of the sale have gone 
directly to the holding company, not the National Treasury. 
  Funds: "If privatization is aimed at raising money for the 
Treasury, we must sell our stock in the big parent companies 
such as Petrobras, Eletrobras, the CVRD, and Telebras," she 
says. But she explains that doing so would also mean selling 
ownership in each of those firms to a single parent company. And 
in her opinion, that could not be done because it would make the 
economy's pattern of efficiency worse. As an example, she points 
to the sale of the Chilean electric companies. Their sale 
followed that pattern, and the result for the government has 
been serious and undesirable problems with regulation. 
  In view of all those special features, the Brazilian 
privatization program must, according to Marina Figueira's 
study, be seen not as a way of raising cash but of unburdening 
the state and increasing efficiency and competitiveness. The 
result, says the professor, is that every step in the direction 
of privatization must be carefully executed. "If it is concerned 
about its level of revenues, the government could sell the firms 
quickly. In that case, the cost of raising cash quickly would 
fall upon the private sector," she says, pointing out that a 
different approach should be adopted in selling off each group 
to be privatized. 
  SEST: Marina Figueira de Mello warns that her figures 
regarding the net worth of government-owned firms were not based 
on more recent data than those in the 1988 register of balance 
sheets because that was the most recent survey published by the 
Special Secretariat for State Enterprises (SEST). 
  The register lists 258 firms whose majority stockholder is 
the Union: 179 in the productive sector, 20 typical government 
enterprises (Brazilian Agriculture and Livestock Research 
Enterprise, for example), 28 service licensees providing 
electricity, 25 financial firms, and six social security and 
welfare services. 
  "Over the past five years, the performance of the 
government-owned firms included in the program has improved, 
with favorable effects on their operating results, a factor that 
has probably caused their net worth to increase even further," 
the professor comments.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Real Danger"] </F>
  [Text] The importance of the transition from the URV [Real 
Value Unit] to the real has gone beyond our borders and worried 
Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. Cavallo, whose 
dollarization plan inspired the economic team of former Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, recommended haste in the 
implementation of the new currency. 
  Minister Cavallo's concerns go beyond the academic field. 
Given that Brazil is Argentina's largest trade partner and is 
responsible for Argentina's negative trade balance of more than 
$1 billion, he hopes the new currency will help stop or even 
reverse the Argentine trade deficit. 
  Brazil's cautiousness is linked to the fact that the 
Brazilian economic team does not intend to repeat the Argentine 
mistake of establishing a fixed parity of one peso equal to one 
dollar. The Argentine fixed exchange rate has become a trap: 
The accumulated inflation under the dollarized economy 
surpasses 30 percent, but the exchange devaluation necessary to 
equalize the Argentine trade balance cannot be implemented 
because the Argentine Central Bank does not have enough exchange 
reserves to pay for the pesos in circulation. 
  From the academic point of view we respect the reason of the 
plan masterminds who are waiting for a more favorable moment to 
implement the real. The reason is: the synchronization of all 
the prices and production factors that adopted the URV. Once the 
economy is less worried about past accounts, it will be ready to 
readjust prices and calculate short-term costs. 
  Since the URV is a short-term indexation factor, the costs 
of 
salaries, financial operations, school fares, and public utility 
rates will begin to reflect the present and influence the 
composition of prices. Finance Ministry special adviser Jose 
Milton Dallari admits that it is naive to believe that all 
prices will be synchronized in URV's when the real comes into 
circulation. If 85 percent of prices are adjusted in URV's, it 
will be very good, therefore leaving very small inflationary 
residues for the new currency. 
  JORNAL DO BRASIL has verified that the adoption of the URV 
has slowed the increase of wholesale prices, but the trend still 
has not affected retail prices. Commerce, with supermarkets at 
the head, is trying to recover -- through price increases -- the 
financial profits it conceded to industry when it established 
prices in URV. 
  The loss of financial profits obtained through the float 
[preceding word in English] between purchases in installments 
and sales in cash is forcing commerce to adopt new strategies. 
Other sectors of the economy also will be seriously affected if 
the transition from the URV to the real brings stability to the 
economy. The most affected sector will doubtlessly be the 
financial sector, which is making large profits and broadening 
its portion in the composition of the GDP thanks to the float 
provided by the effect of inflation on cash deposits that do not 
earn interest. 
  In a lecture to foreign diplomats in Brasilia, Central Bank 
International Affairs Director Gustavo Franco was not impressed 
by reports of a slowdown in price increases. According to 
Franco, the important issue is to reduce inflation to one digit. 
Prices that dropped somewhat in January and February, increased 
1 percent in March with the adoption of the URV. 
  Despite the good news on the wholesale prices, independent 
economists fear for the plan's credibility in retail commerce. 
If the population continues feeling inflation in URV's, the 
credibility of the real will be undermined. Former Finance 
Minister Mario Henrique Simonsen already has mentioned this 
danger, which now is worrying Cavallo. 
  Former Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has given his 
successor Rubens Ricupero freedom to choose the moment to put 
the real into circulation. A recent meeting between Cardoso and 
the economic team -- when he asked them to put the new currency 
into circulation soon -- created political uneasiness. 
  Given that Congress has neither redefined the role of the 
state in the economy in the constitutional revision, nor 
promoted a deep social security reform or a new federal pact to 
redistribute income and responsibilities among the federal 
government and the states and municipalities -- which should 
have a considerable impact in the fiscal policy -- the people 
will suspect that the stabilization plan has been reduced to a 
short-term election campaign banner. Nothing should be used as a 
pretext to make Brazil lose another opportunity to defeat 
inflation.

  [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in 
Portuguese 26 Apr 94 p 1 reports that Central Bank Norms 
Director Claudio Mauch has announced that as of 25 April the 
banks are authorized to issue Bank Deposit Certificates, CDB's, 
and Bank Deposit Receipts, RDB's, in Real Value Units, URV's. 
These certificates will thus earn a lower annual interest rate 
plus monetary correction which will be determined at the 
maturity date. This means investors will know their profits on 
the maturity date of the document. Savings accounts will 
continue to earn the Referential Interest Rate, TR, plus a 
6-percent annual interest. If the banks en mass adopt the URV, 
the Central Bank will have to modify the TR calculation formula. 
The TR is currently calculated on the interests paid by the 
prefixed CDB which is a preestablished interest-earning paper 
that does not receive monetary correction.

  [Text] The narcotics trade in Rio de Janeiro has not 
changed since the home of numbers game kingpin Castor de Andrade 
was raided on 30 March. Marijuana and cocaine continue to be 
sold at a rapid pace despite state attorneys' revelations that 
numbers game people are linked to drug trafficking. Last week, a 
truck coming from Bolivia ensured a 30-day supply of cocaine to 
all the southern districts of Rio de Janeiro and to some of the 
northern districts. The truck, which carried hardwood, brought 
100 kg of the drug from the Chapare Region, where there are 
large coca leaf plantations. 
  Drug trafficker Joao Matuto, a narcotics trade leader in the 
Rocinha slum, was responsible for this shipment. Matuto sent a 
message to the state attorneys: "This business about Castor de 
Andrade has political roots; it will end up as nothing." 
  Half of the cargo that arrived in Rocinha is enough to 
supply 
the slum for one month. The other half will be stored or resold 
to drug traffickers linked to Joao Matuto. The drugs were 
purchased for $1,500 per kg in Bolivia, but will reach 
consumer's hands at a price almost seven times higher. It will 
be sold for an average of $10 per gram. 
  A drug trafficker linked to Matuto asserted: "If there are 
indeed links with the numbers game people, it must be in 
relation to international drug trafficking. It has nothing to 
do with us." Without worrying about defending the numbers game 
people, the drug traffickers explain that the retail sale of the 
drugs does not require financing to reach the streets. "Those 
who are trusted can simply take the drugs and pay for them 
later. The sales profits guarantee that those who sold the 
drugs will pay for them," he added. 
  Drug traffickers Joao Matuto, Jorge Luis of the Acari slum, 
and Miltinho da Ilha are considered the Rio de Janeiro State 
drug trafficking barons. One step below are drug traffickers 
Orlando Jogador from Leopoldina District and Pedrinho Maluco of 
the so-called Western Zone of the city. They are the only ones 
capable of ensuring the arrival of large shipments of drugs, 
similar to that which arrived in the Rocinha slum last week. 
  The rest of the drug arrives in the country thanks to mules 
(or matutos) who travel to Bolivia or Colombia, which are drug 
producing countries, and then bring the drugs to the slums in 
their backpacks. There are nearly 300 of these small drug 
traffickers in Rio de Janeiro. They always carry drugs, but 
never more than 5 kg of marijuana or cocaine. 
  According to arms traffickers, the weapons market functions 
in a slightly different manner. Most of the arms enter the 
country through the airport, and depend on federal police 
cooperation. Arms circulation, an illegal weapon can change 
hands between policemen and drug traffickers several times, 
makes it less necessary to import arms than drugs. Policemen 
seize AR-15 rifles, HK submachine guns, and 9 mm pistols from 
criminals. Policemen then sell these arms, and they end up in 
the hands of the criminals again. Currently an AR-15 rifle is 
worth $4,000, an HK submachine gun $3,500, and a pistol $1,500. 
  The arms that do not arrive on planes are brought to the 
country by the mules (or matutos) and follow routes similar to 
those followed by the drugs. They can come from Paraguay, 
Bolivia, or Colombia. The number of arms mules is much smaller 
than that of drug mules. In the Rocinha slum, for example, 
there are only four or five arms mules. 
  To reach the slums with marijuana or cocaine, the drug 
traffickers must duck policemen at the control posts along the 
highways connecting Rio de Janeiro to foreign borders, and count 
on the policemen's cooperation to do so. Today, the highways 
that are used most often to bring drugs or arms into the country 
begin at the Bolivian, Colombian, and Paraguayan borders and 
cross the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Parana, and 
Sao Paulo. 
  Bolivian cocaine crosses to the Brazilian side through the 
town of San Matias. From there on, the trucks follow a dirt 
road up to the city of Caceres, 180 km from Cuiaba (Mato Grosso 
State). There they find the first obstacle: a Federal Highway 
Police control post that has to be eluded with the help of the 
local farmers, who allow the mules to cross their land. 
  The route then crosses Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul 
State, along the BR-163 highway. The route then follows BR-262 
highway up to Tres Lagoas on the Sao Paulo State border, and 
reaches Rio de Janeiro through the Presidente Dutra Highway. 
The strategic points in the most used highway arms route are 
Pedro Juan Caballero, Paraguay, and its neighboring Brazilian 
town of Ponta Pora. To reach Rio de Janeiro, the arms cross 
Dourados and Nova Alvorada (Mato Grosso do Sul State), and 
Presidente Epitacio (Sao Paulo State). 
  Other drugs and arms shipments arrive in small planes that 
fly from Colombia to Sao Paulo and then land in small 
clandestine airports at the town of Angra dos Reis on the 
so-called Green Coast. The shipments then reach Rio de Janeiro 
through the Rio-Santos highway. The shipments are obtained from 
the producers through a trust system: The drug is paid for only 
after it is sold to consumers.

  [Text] Electoral polls carried out by the Army Intelligence 
Center (CIE) and the Navy Intelligence Center (Cenimar) have 
both discovered that Lula [Luis Inacio da Silva, Worker's Party 
candidate] could win the elections for president in the first 
round. 
  The military analysts concluded that if a second round of 
voting were held in the elections, Lula's probable adversary 
would be former Governor Orestes Quercia from the PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], and not Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso. According to the military analysts, Cardoso has a 
chance to win in the first round only in the state of Minas 
Gerais, where he has the support of Governor Helio Garcia. 
  The report was delivered to President Itamar Franco by a 
military minister.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Yesterday, Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso officially asked 
Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader 
in the Chamber of Deputies, to join his ticket as candidate for 
vice president. Cardoso told Luis Eduardo that he would be vice 
presidential candidate in these elections only if he so desires, 
thus leaving the decision entirely in the hands of Luis Eduardo, 
who did not give a definite answer. 
  Although he did not clearly reject the invitation, Luis 
Eduardo expressed his reticence to Cardoso. The two talked for 
an hour and a half, analyzed an alliance between the two parties 
in the states, and settled the last details of an alliance that 
will be officially announced on 2 May. 
  Former Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, father of 
Luis Eduardo, will meet with Cardoso in Rio de Janeiro tomorrow, 
but will not attend the ceremony on 2 May. Luis Eduardo 
admitted he has spoken with Cardoso about the vice presidency 
for the first time, but he did not want to give any details. 
"It would not be polite," he said. 
  Luis Eduardo said the PFL decision will probably be 
announced 
next weekend, depending on the date chosen for the party 
convention.

<F P=106> [Article by Dora Kramer: "The Men Whom Cardoso Would Take to </F>
Planalto Palace"] 
  [Text] Brasilia -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso [FHC] likes to 
say that no one speaks for him. He is also in the habit of never 
telling everything he knows or thinks to everybody. He says a 
little bit to each one and keeps for himself the prerogative of 
putting facts together and forming convictions. But he cannot do 
without the cooperation of a select group of individuals whose 
power to influence him varies according to their area of 
activity, degree of friendship, and competence. There are the 
professionals, the politicians, the intellectuals, and the 
friends. 
  A place as special as it is discreet is that occupied by his 
wife, Ruth Cardoso. Those who are on close terms with FHC are of 
the opinion that if he won the election, she would be much more 
than the First Lady. "Ruth is a very good thinker, and Fernando 
listens to her more than people can imagine," says his friend 
Sergio Mota, secretary general of the PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party] and a member of the group that combines 
friendship and politics. Another such member is Deputy Jose 
Serra, a friend from before 1964 and a companion in exile who, 
he says, is unfairly pointed to as a surreptitious opponent of 
FHC. 
  The loyalty invoked by Serra is the feature common to the 
three advisers currently regarded as the most important people 
in Fernando Henrique's day-to-day political life. They are press 
adviser Ana Tavares, special adviser Eduardo Jorge, and combined 
congressional adviser and ghost writer Eduardo Graeff. They will 
be important figures in the campaign, and if Fernando Henrique 
is elected, they will occupy a privileged place in Planalto 
Palace. 
  FHC also has supporters outside Brasilia. One of them is 
Francisco Graziano, chief of the candidate's Sao Paulo office. 
And in the field of ideas, he has philosopher Jose Arthur 
Giannotti of the USP [University of Sao Paulo] at his side. Some 
people also point to former Deputy Jose Gregori, now chef de 
cabinet to Marcilio Marques Moreira, as being one of his very 
close friends. 
  A bright star in the political category is Tasso Jereissati, 
although Fernando Henrique now regards Senator Mario Covas as 
one of the most loyal and honorable party members on his side. 
Here we present a short profile of some of Fernando Henrique's 
faithful companions. 
<H5>  Sergio Mota: Close Friend, Indispensable Adviser </H5>
  In the group that combines friendship and politics, Mota, 
Cardoso, and Federal Deputy Jose Serra form an inseparable trio. 
Sergio Mota is an engineer who engaged in student politics as a 
member of Popular Action (AP) during the years of repression. He 
owns a business in Sao Paulo, was president of Eletropaulo (the 
electric company in Sao Paulo) when Franco Montoro (PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]) was governor, and is such 
a close friend of Fernando Henrique Cardoso that they own a 
ranch together in Minas Gerais. 
  At crucial moments, such as the time when it was decided 
that 
the PSDB would join Fernando Collor's administration in 1992, or 
during party crises, or now, as Cardoso leaves the Ministry of 
Finance, Sergio Mota lands in Brasilia and works at party 
headquarters -- he is secretary general -- or in Congress. But 
he is on the telephone with Fernando Henrique several times a 
day. 
  There are those who say that Sergio Mota will run for 
federal 
deputy, but he himself evades the issue: "I enjoy party 
politics; I have been involved in it since I was a student," he 
says, but does not explain whether or not he is going to move up 
to the front line in politics. In one way or another, he is 
already there. As secretary general of the PSDB, he takes part 
in all party decisions and is active on several fronts. 
<H5>  Eduardo Graeff: Most Prestigious PSDB Writer </H5>
  The one who describes him exactly is Jose Serra the 
sociologist: "If there was an Eduardo pill, I would take it." 
The reason is that the congressional adviser to the former 
minister of finance, who has now gone on the campaign trail, is 
one of the most highly praised members of Fernando Henrique's 
staff. Chiefly because of his writing, which, according to PSDB 
members in general, borders on perfection. He is the one behind 
almost everything that leaves the PSDB and its environs in 
written form: speeches, articles, documents, and even technical 
texts. Provisional Measure 434, which created the URV [real unit 
of value], owed a great deal to Eduardo, who is very much in 
demand as a speechwriter by the party's bloc in Congress. 
  As congressional adviser, he functioned as Fernando 
Henrique's point man with Congress, where he spends the entire 
day talking on his cellular telephone. He has been part of the 
group for over 10 years, and because of his duties as a writer, 
he is considered to be one of those most familiar with what 
Fernando Henrique is thinking. 
<H5>  Jose Serra: Not-Always-Peaceful Friendship </H5>
  Considering everything that is said, it is surprising that 
Serra should be on this list. But there is no one in the group 
who does not say he is one of Fernando Henrique's closest and 
most influential friends. The two of them have followed a common 
path that began before 1964, when the deputy was president of 
the National Union of Students in Sao Paulo, continued in exile 
abroad, and is now being strengthened in post-amnesty politics. 
  But the surprise some people feel at Serra's presence in the 
group is the result of two facts. First, there is the story that 
has always made Serra out to be a candidate for the Ministry of 
Finance. Second, there is the fact that relations between the 
two are not always peaceful. A typical love-hate relationship, 
according to some. It is true that they quarrel and that they 
frequently disagree -- especially since Fernando Henrique is the 
king of tolerance and Serra the emperor of impatience -- but 
there is no important decision in FHC's life in which Serra does 
not participate. 
<H5>  Ana Tavares: Adviser Who Also Knows the Political Game </H5>
  Ana is the daughter of journalist Tavares de Miranda, who 
was 
FOLHA DE SAO PAULO's society columnist for years, and that may 
explain why she has so much mobility in her duties as press 
adviser -- duties that end up slipping into the giving of 
personal and political advice. She receives about 80 telephone 
calls per day, and it is not rare for her to have to write 12 
exclusive memos for 12 different political columns. Ana likes to 
stay home to read and talk on the telephone. Before 0900, she is 
already at work in her office. Unobtrusive even in the way she 
dresses -- always skirt and blouse, low moccasins, black hair 
combed back and sometimes held in place by red-framed glasses -- 
Ana Tavares is so discreet as to be mysterious. Out of respect 
for such a reserved manner, not even her closest friends ask her 
how old she is. Nonsense: she says straight out that she is past 
40. But that is as far as she will go, since she is absolutely 
against the idea of coming out of the shadows. "An adviser has 
to stay in the background" is her motto. Ana does her work, 
which goes far beyond that simply of a press adviser. "When I 
want some information and cannot get through to Fernando 
Henrique, I turn to her, and she always has something to say," 
says Alberico de Souza Cruz, director of journalism for the 
Globo Network. 
<H5>  Eduardo Jorge: Discreet `Lightning Rod' for Entire Team </H5>
  An expert on public administration, Eduardo Jorge is 
considered to be Fernando Henrique's alter ego. Like Ana 
Tavares, he has a horror of being in the spotlight and, if 
questioned, greatly downplays his own importance to the 
candidate: "Here I am just an adviser." Modesty. He is the man 
that FHC puts in charge of special missions, and he is called 
the team's "lightning rod." His missions are so special and 
secret that there is no record of them for history. There is 
only the testimony of the other members of the group, who 
suddenly turn forgetful. 
  Eduardo is an international consultant in the legislative 
area. He was educated abroad and has worked as director of the 
Senate Data Processing Center (Prodasen), which he helped 
organize. Both in the Senate and in the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs and Finance, Eduardo Jorge's office has always been just 
a couple of meters away from Fernando Henrique's. 
<H5>  Tasso Jereissati: Key Man in Setting up Alliances </H5>
  A new friend but one always close to Fernando Henrique at 
crucial moments. In the two weeks before FHC's candidacy was 
announced, he was put in charge of contacts. It was he who 
worked hardest to get the PT [Workers Party] to ally itself with 
the PSDB. Now he is talking to Minas Gerais Governor Helio 
Garcia of the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] and to the president 
of the PP [Progressive Party], Alvaro Dias. His point men in the 
PFL [Liberal Front Party] are Antonio Carlos Magalhaes and the 
party president, Jorge Bornhausen. Tasso, who is also in charge 
of the communications area, was recently in Rio de Janeiro to 
talk to Roberto Marinho, owner of the Globo Organizations. Until 
the end of May, which is the deadline for holding party 
conventions, he will be the key man in setting up alliances. 
Twice considered for a cabinet post (in the Sarney and Collor 
administrations), he is said to be a shoo-in for a first-echelon 
position if Fernando Henrique reaches Planalto Palace.

<F P=106> [Article by Gilberto Nascimento: "Stories of a Left-Wing </F>
Ph.D."] 
  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso was supported 
by the metalworkers in the ABC [Santo Andre, Sao Bernardo do 
Campo, and Sao Caetano do Sul) region in his bid for the Senate 
in the late 1970's, and he also became known as a respectable 
left-wing sociologist. Today he is regarded as a kind of 
"spiritual father" to the Brazilian Analysis and Planning Center 
(Cebrap), an organization that he helped establish along with a 
group of "progressive" scientists and intellectuals in 1969. 
  Fernando Henrique headed Cebrap until 1982, when he resigned 
to fill a vacancy in the Senate (he was Franco Montoro's 
alternate, and Montoro was elected state governor in that year). 
His wife, anthropologist and retired USP [University of Sao 
Paulo] professor Ruth Cardoso, is still one of Cebrap's 
coordinators. As Cebrap's president, Fernando Henrique was 
threatened with imprisonment and torture. He was helped during 
that period by Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, Archbishop of Sao 
Paulo, and the two of them are still close friends today. "They 
even threw bombs into the organization's offices," the cardinal 
recalls. "I went to defend him and was very happy to put my life 
in danger to save the members of that research association -- 
the most important in the country -- from torture." 
  Divided support: Ruth Cardoso feels that Cebrap will respond 
to FHC's [Fernando Henrique Cardoso's] candidacy in the same way 
that it has always responded when any of its members has sought 
elective office. According to her, Cebrap will discuss his 
proposals "in a critical manner" and, as an institution, will 
not take a stand "either for or against." The minister does not 
enjoy unanimous support today among Cebrap's coordinators. He is 
supported by his wife and coordinators Elza Berquo, a 
demographer, and Jose Arthur Gianotti, a philosopher. The 
institution's current president, economist Francisco de 
Oliveira, and historian Luiz Felipe de Alencastro are voting for 
Lula. 
  In the union movement, Fernando Henrique obtained support in 
his campaign for the Senate in 1978 from Luiz Inacio Lula da 
Silva (PT [Workers Party]), the man who took him to the factory 
gates back then to win the workers' support and who is now his 
opponent. "The minister needed votes badly," recalls Djalma Bom, 
a former director of the Sao Bernardo Metalworkers Union and 
former PT deputy who was one of the top comrades leading the 
historic strikes in Sao Paulo's ABC region. "He was out of his 
element. He was always quiet, watching and observing. The 
ordinary workers thought he was strange and would ask: `What in 
the hell kind of candidate is that who comes here and doesn't 
say anything?' But we got a lot of votes. If he had been bolder, 
he would not have lost the election," says Djalma Bom. Fernando 
Henrique received 1.2 million votes and became Franco Montoro's 
alternate. 
  Atheist: His second electoral experience was a disaster. In 
1985, when he was running for mayor of Sao Paulo on the PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] ticket, he lost the 
election to Janio Quadros after being branded an "atheist" 
because he refused during a televised debate to give a straight 
answer when asked whether he believed in God. While the votes 
were still being counted -- he was ahead at the time -- he even 
sat down in the mayor's seat to be photographed and then had to 
face a humiliating defeat. 
  After the military coup in 1964, Fernando Henrique, along 
with such intellectuals as Florestan Fernandes and Mario 
Schenberg, was indicted in a Military Police Investigation. He 
was teaching at the University of Sao Paul (USP) at the time. He 
was retired from his post as university professor and 
immediately went into exile in Argentina, Chile, and France. He 
returned to Brazil in 1967 and went back to the USP. His 
political rights were taken away again in 1969 for political 
reasons on the basis of AI [Institutional Act] No. 5. After 
being considered for the post of minister of foreign affairs in 
the Collor administration, he was named to that office during 
Itamar Franco's administration in October 1992. He has been at 
the Ministry of Finance since May of last year.

  [Text] Brasilia, April 25 (CTK) -- This afternoon, Premier 
Vaclav Klaus and Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim signed 
an agreement on economic cooperation and the mutual granting of 
most-favored nation status. The agreement calls for cooperation 
to increase trade turnover between the two countries, to 
diversify goods traded, and to share expertise and technology in 
the production of machines and equipment. It also provides for 
the mutual exchange of information on future investment programs. 
  Brazil, thanks to its large and unsaturated market, is one 
of 
the Czech Republic's most important Latin American trade 
partners. Trade relations between the two countries date back to 
1918. 
  However, trade with Brazil has been decreasing over the past 
three years. In 1991, trade amounted to $90 million, but last 
year it reached only $45 million. Exports from the Czech 
Republic over the past three years remained relatively stable, 
amounting to $13 million per year. On the other hand, exports 
from Brazil decreased from $77 million in 1991 to $32 million 
last year. 
  One of the reasons for this situation is that many 
industrial 
enterprises have ceased to use the services of foreign trade 
companies and are trying to penetrate the Brazilian market 
directly, according to Karel Klima of the Czech Embassy in 
Brazil, who met with Czech business people in Rio de Janeiro. 
Businesses desiring to sell on the Brazilian market but lacking 
familiarity with the country should take advantage of trade 
fairs and the services of commercial chambers to establish 
contacts in Brazil. 
  The Czech Republic supplies mostly whole plants to Brazil. 
At present nine large electricity plants and 10 cement plants 
built by Czechoslovakia are operating in the country. During 
their stay, representatives of Prerovske Strojirny hope to reach 
an agreement on further supplies of cement plants, according to 
sources from the Czech trade mission. Brazil exports to the 
Czech Republic include mostly soy groats (39 percent of total 
exports), coffee, tobacco, animal hides, iron ore, and fruit. 
  The agreement signed today also calls for the creation of a 
commission to increase trade and economic cooperation between 
the Czech Republic and Brazil. The commission is to submit to 
the two countries' governments proposals concerning the 
development of relations, to propose new cooperation projects, 
and to support the exchange of economic information. The 
commission will meet once every two years, alternately in Prague 
and Brasilia. 
  Klaus also discussed today with Brazilian President Itamar 
Franco cooperation in the field of international politics and in 
the United Nations.

  [Text] Brasilia April 26 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic and 
Brazil are both interested in increasing the volume of mutual 
trade and extending economic cooperation, Czech Premier Vaclav 
Klaus and Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said yesterday. 
  The Czech Government is prepared to enter negotiations on 
the 
creation of a free trade zone either between the Czech Republic 
and Brazil or between the countries of the Central European Free 
Trade Agreement (CEFTA) on the one hand and the Mercosur 
Association (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay) on the 
other, Klaus said at a press conference after his meetings with 
Amorim, Brazilian President Itamar Franco and other leading 
figures. 
  Klaus spoke in favour of creating bilateral free trade zones 
when in Argentina and Chile on an earlier stage of his ten-day 
tour of South American countries. 
  Amorim told CTK on Monday [25 April] a free trade zone 
should 
not be limited to the two states but rather include all Mercosur 
and CEFTA countries. He said he felt prospects for greater 
mutual trade were very good because the economies of Brazil and 
the Czech Republic had undergone great changes, privatisation 
and intensive liberalisation. 
  Amorim hailed the agreement on economic cooperation and the 
mutual granting of most-favoured nation status which he signed 
with Klaus on Monday as the first step towards closer trading 
relations. But he also urged the two sides set up a joint 
commission, on the basis of an inter-governmental agreement, to 
ensure the political framework for bilateral business. 
  Klaus said the drop in trade with Brazil over the last three 
years was only a temporary phenomenon and refused to draw any 
conclusions from it. He said the market was opening up and the 
volume of trade could be expected to increase. 
  In foreign affairs Klaus said the two countries had many 
views in common, which allowed them to work together within the 
framework of the United Nations and elsewhere. Amorim said the 
UN Security Council should be enlarged if it were to remain 
legitimate in the new world. Developing countries should also 
be represented on it, he said. 
  On Monday evening Klaus left for Sao Paulo where he is to 
meet the Sao Paulo state governor and meet university students 
before returning to Prague.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, April 26 (CTK) -- Today, Premier Vaclav 
Klaus ended his 10-day South American visit with discussions 
with Sao Paulo State Governor Luis Fleur. The state of Sao Paulo 
is the largest industrial, trade, and financial center of the 
Federal Republic of Brazil and forms almost half of its GDP. 
  Klaus told reporters that the discussions focused on the 
possibility of the export of Czech transport equipment, 
specifically trams, buses, and trolley-buses. He said the Czech 
side would soon receive the conditions of a tender to be 
announced during the following months, which would concern the 
development of the transport system in one of the biggest towns 
in the world. 
  Fleur called for the formation of joint ventures between 
Czech and Sao Paulo firms to make easier the realization of 
specific orders for equipment to develop and improve the town's 
transport system, which fails to meet the needs of the town's 16 
million inhabitants.

Brazilian-made primary training airplanes to the Bolivian Air 
Force. The Brazilian Aeronautics Ministry considers the 
refurbishing cost of these airplanes, which are poorly 
maintained, very high. "They are as worn out as a driving school

airplanes, also called [Aerotec T-23] Uirapuru, were used to 
train Aeronautics cadets in their first year of pilots school.

  [Text] Havana, 27 Apr (PL) -- The Cuban parliament is 
preparing to debate the controversial issue of cleaning up its 
internal finances without resorting to the classical mechanisms 
of neoliberalism, as the country faces the most difficult 
economic situation in 30 years. 
  Financial adjustments and shock policies have been ruled out 
by the authorities because the effects on the population would 
be incomparably worse, according to Carlos Lage Davila, 
secretary of the Council of Ministers Executive Committee. 
  Many parliamentarians have said the best technical solution 
must be politically feasible and consistent with the strategic 
goal of protecting the social accomplishments achieved over 
three decades. 
  These measures, these sources say, must have the support of 
the majority of the people, hence the great effort recently made 
to extend the debate to work centers and encourage millions of 
people to directly participate in this process, popularly called 
workers parliaments. 
  The issue was extensively debated by approximately 3 million 
workers, who attended more than 80,000 meetings held between 
January and March at their work centers to analyze the 
improvement of internal finances. 
  With a fiscal deficit of more that 4.2 billion pesos 
(equivalent to U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate) and 
excess money in circulation amounting to approximately 11 
billion, Cuban authorities are seeking formulas to correct 
Cuba's finances and economic feasibility and reduce the two 
indexes. 
  Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon said there is a 
consensus that no single measure will perform the miracle unless 
it is accompanied by an increase in production and economic 
efficiency. What is more, we are trying to earn greater profits 
in state-owned companies, 69 percent of which are currently 
losing money, Alarcon admitted. 
  Strengthening the national currency, encouraging work and 
production, and restoring the role of the salary are other goals 
the National Assembly could present in the special period of 
sessions to begin on 1 May.

<F P=106> [By Miguel Lozano: "The Cuban Assembly Began Debate on </F>
Improving Finances"] 
  [Text] Havana, 1 May (PL) -- In the midst of a complex 
economic situation, the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [ANPP] began a special session devoted to defining 
policy to improve the country's internal finances. 
  This is the second time since last December that Cuban 
deputies have debated the difficult current situation, which is 
marked by a budget deficit of more than 4.2 billion pesos 
(equivalent to the dollar) and a liquidity surplus of more than 
11 billion pesos. 
  During the prior session, the ANPP decided to suspend 
analysis so as to summon a consultation with the people, held 
from January to March with the participation of three million 
workers in more than 80,000 meetings presided over by labor 
union representatives, a process dubbed the "workers congress." 
  The deputies are facing the difficult task of establishing 
general guidelines to improve finances and promote the 
reactivation of production without resorting to a "shock policy" 
that would entail additional sacrifices for the neediest 
segments of society. 
  President Fidel Castro, who is attending the ANPP special 
session, warned an unquestionable principle of the policy of 
recovery is that "the revolution will not leave anyone 
unprotected." 
  Authorities also made it clear that though not all the 
measures to be adopted will be popular they hope to get the 
people's understanding on the need to make "a shared sacrifice" 
so as to achieve industrial recovery. 
  Local experts believe it is indispensable to lower the 
budget 
deficit and the money surplus to cope with the economic crisis 
provoked by the drastic reduction of the country's importing 
capacity due to the disappearance of the European Socialist Bloc 
and the tightening of the U.S. blockade. 
  According to sources, the chief guidelines to improve the 
economy include raising prices, eliminating undue benefits 
created by the revolution, and reducing subsidies given to state 
enterprises for losses. These are aspects the ANPP must debate. 
  The authorities and people queried during the assemblies 
concur on the need to halt and eliminate illicit enrichment 
through speculation and the black market, which flourished in 
the last [words indistinct]. 
  This special session was preceded by a state overhaul, which 
included the elimination and merger of several ministries, 
institutes, and state committees, in search of a better 
organization, as part of the general efforts to lift the country 
out of the difficult economic situation. 
  In this context, the almost 600 deputies of this session, 
which should conclude tomorrow, are tasked with establishing the 
guidelines for improving finances, which are considered vital 
for reactivating the economy, eliminating the crisis, and 
preserving the gains of the Cuban socialist program.

<F P=106> [Report by Walfredo Angulo] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 1 May (PL) -- Statistics may be cold facts, 
but figures revealed today during a special session of the local 
parliament resulted in heated debates over how to improve Cuba's 
internal finances. 
  A large number of parliamentary members spoke in favor of 
the 
proposals submitted by Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister of finance 
and prices, who outlined what may be collected by the state to 
achieve the liquidity the economy requires through an increase 
in tax collection. 
  The minister emphasized the need to have healthy finances, 
the lack of which presents the greatest obstacle to improving 
the Cuban economy. 
  Following the statements made after thousands of meetings 
were held throughout the country earlier this year at the 
so-called parliaments in the workplace, deputies endorsed the 
elimination of certain benefits, as well as the implementation 
of formulas to encourage savings. 
  The plenary session was encouraged by the report that 
outstanding debts among enterprises dropped 11.3 percent in the 
first quarter. 
  The reduction of 1 billion pesos (equal to the dollar at the 
official exchange rate) in this year's budget, determined by the 
government, was taken as an example of the implementation of 
recommendations issued within the consultation process begun 
months ago. 
  There was a consensus among speakers that none of the 
proposed measures per se will work miracles if they are not 
accompanied by increased production and economic efficiency. 
  Another general idea that prevails among parliamentary 
members is the need to strengthen the national currency, to 
encourage work and productivity, and to progressively recover 
the role of the salary. 
  According to the analysis, this entails a gradual increase 
in 
the offering of assets and services to predetermined groups, 
along with measures to encourage workers in priority areas. 
  Benefits were also questioned, and special emphasis was 
placed on the educational character of charging for certain 
services that are offered free or at nominal fees to the 
population. 
  While the debates continue, the search for solutions is 
still 
the main concern of the 551 parliamentary members. 
  The goal is to overcome the country's difficult economic 
situation, which was characterized by a monetary surplus of 
approximately 11.636 billion pesos at the end of March and a 
budget deficit of approximately 4.2 billion.

<F P=106> [By Luis M. Saez] </F>
  [Text] Among the measures discussed by the Cuban parliament 
on 1 May to reverse the country's difficult financial situation 
is the possibility of changing the currency. 
  Deputy Lazaro Barredo presented the above measure to the 
parliament, which is in special session to find a solution to 
end the excess of currency in circulation, estimated at some 11 
billion pesos (official exchange rate is one peso per dollar). 
  Barredo told PRENSA LATINA that a change of currency would 
be 
one of the most effective, pivotal methods to cleanse and 
improve the economy. 
  He added that the measure, within the framework of others to 
be adopted later, would allow the country to expedite the 
economic recovery and would represent an improvement of the 
economic model the country is implementing. 
  The deputy pointed out that price policies alone will not 
solve the problem. He added that among other issues being 
analyzed it was found that a shortage of cigarettes on the 
official market has driven prices up to 30 pesos per pack on the 
so-called black market. 
  A consistent change of currency would be less disturbing to 
the lower-income population and for those who have managed to 
save some money. 
  When asked if the legalization of the possession of freely 
convertible currency (summer of 1993) was one of the causes of 
the current imbalance, he said that in all cases, a strong 
currency (foreign exchange) acts to the detriment of a weak 
currency, as is the case with the national currency. 
  Barredo underscored that this economic distortion is 
primarily caused by the lack of demand for goods and services in 
terms of Cuban pesos. 
  This special session of parliament is being held with the 
sole objective of analyzing the nation's financial situation and 
making a number of decisions to end that problem.

  [Text] Havana, 1 May (PL) -- Cuban deputies today demanded 
the adoption of measures to curb illegal enrichment, a 
demoralizing factor for social and labor discipline. 
  Historian and Deputy Eusebio Leal issued an appeal to act 
without delay against "scoundrels and speculators" according to 
the revolution's legal system. 
  In a special session of the National Assembly of the 
People's 
Government (parliament) held today, Rolando Lao, parliamentary 
member for Plaza de la Capital Municipality, emphasized the need 
to adjust the taxes imposed on self-employed workers according 
to the income they earn. 
  "We must not expect miracles. The deputies, government, and 
public administration officials are responsible for preventing 
the diversion of state resources to the black market," he said, 
adding that he endorses the gradual enforcement of measures that 
will affect a majority of the population. 
  The deputies argued for and against changing the currency as 
an instrument to put finances on a sound basis and to control 
and penalize illegal enrichment. 
  Deputy Lazaro Barredo proposed changing the currency, 
freezing funds, and the eventual confiscation of assets owned by 
citizens who cannot justify their incomes. 
  Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the parliament's Economic 
Affairs Commission, said that changing the currency can be 
another measure used but that it is not a solution per se. He 
did not link it to the policy against the so-called "currency 
hoarders," citizens whose wealth stems from the black market or 
from speculation. 
  He said: These people converted a sizable part of their 
funds into assets a long time ago, so changing the currency 
would not be efficient. He said there are other options 
available without resorting to a change of currency. 
  He reminded everyone that if you analyze savings accounts, 
you will see that 62 percent of the population has money 
deposited in the national banking system. 
  An exchange measure can be traumatic because it would entail 
establishing a limit on the money that can be exchanged and 
freezing funds, with the subsequent negative effects on people 
who have not necessarily grown rich illegally. 
  Under the Cuban economy's current situation, when no 
substantial short-term increase is foreseen in the production 
sector, the change of currency would not have a permanent effect 
on the black market, the economist said. 
  President Fidel Castro also spoke about this issue. He said 
that changing currency is one weapon in the arsenal of measures 
that may be used, but it must never be exclusively aimed at the 
eradication of the so-called "currency-hoarders." 
  He said that the parliament's final decision, whatever it 
may 
be, cannot allow these speculators to walk away scot-free for 
their illegal activity. 
  The assembly, which is being attended by 551 deputies plus 
dozens of foreign guests invited to the 1 May celebrations, has 
only one topic: the analysis of measures to put internal 
finances on a sound basis.

  [Text] Havana, 1 May (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
on 1 May advocated the adoption of administrative rather than 
penal measures against those who violate economic laws. 
  During the debate on renting and the illegal sale of 
vehicles 
and homes at the special session of the Cuban parliament, the 
chief of state called for corrective economic measures, noting 
that they are more effective than prison terms. In addition, 
the corrective economic measures increase rather than diminish 
state resources. 
  During a discussion of the issue, it was reported that fraud 
and misdemeanors have been committed in contracts to rent 
[permutar] and sell homes as well as to transfer automobiles. 
  In a previous speech, the Cuban maximum leader favored 
salary 
revaluations for workers and for those who make an honest living. 
  Fidel Castro said: We are not solving an economic imbalance, 
we are considering what to do and when to do it. 
  He made a call to adopt such measures with political, 
technical, and revolutionary sense until the final consequences. 
He refused to take half measures. 
  He also favored gradual implementation of the measures, as 
did Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and prices minister, who said 
the measures will go into effect in at least 18 months. 
  A change of currency is among the measures being studied by 
the parliament, and there is a consensus to implement it at such 
time as the government deems appropriate. 
  Almost all the speakers requested immediate, harsh 
disciplinary measures against speculators to ensure that the 
architects of the underground economy will not go unpunished. 
  The Assembly decided to conclude this special session on 2 
May. Some 551 deputies and many foreign guests are attending the 
special session.

  [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (PL) -- An editorial appearing in 
TRABAJADORES newspaper, mouthpiece of the Cuban unions, reports 
that over the next 90 days, the new state agencies set up as 
result of recent law-decrees will operate "with the necessary 
number of workers to get the job done." 
  In an editorial entitled "The Central Administration Sets 
the 
Example and Scores the Tune," the weekly newspaper indicates 
that the State Council law-decree" is aimed at ensuring a more 
agile and efficient centralized government more in tune with the 
conditions of the special period." 
  The editorial stresses: "This administration will only 
utilize necessary personnel and will therefore become more 
cost-effective." It adds "attempts to duplicate foreign models 
have resulted in the over-dimensioning and hypertrophy [el 
soberdimensionamiento y la hipertrofia] of the state's central 
apparatus and other areas of the administration." 
  TRABAJADORES points out: "The reduction and reorganization 
of 
the central organizations will be followed by the drafting of 
proposals over the next 90 days for these new state bodies to 
operate with only essential personnel." 
  The unions' mouthpiece stated, however, that "management 
cannot divorce itself from the workers that are being laid off 
but, rather, must ensure their well-being until they have been 
relocated." 
  The magazine emphasizes: "Political courtesy and fraternal 
treatment must be the distinctive trademark of this task, 
together with the determination and strength to see it through." 
  Later, it adds: "The country has sufficient work for all 
workers, officials, specialists, professionals, or technicians 
who seek to serve the fatherland unselfishly and who are willing 
to work to save it." 
  TRABAJADORES concludes by saying: "This is a great 
opportunity we should not squander because it will allow us to 
discard paternalistic trends."

<F P=106> [By Moises Perez Mok] </F>
  [Text] Structural adjustment and refinement of the Cuban 
tourism industry reached its peak today with the promulgation of 
Decree-Law No. 147, by which a ministry was created for this 
robust sector. 
  By virtue of this legislation, Vice President Osmany 
Cienfuegos Gorriaran will be the chief of that portfolio, one of 
the three created (the others are the Economy and Planning 
Ministry and the Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation 
Ministry) as part of the downsizing and reduction of the Cuban 
state apparatus. 
  In a recent chat with local reporters, Cienfuegos said the 
Tourism Ministry will consist of a very small apparatus 
(approximately 50 to 60 people) and will be unrelated to all 
administrative areas. 
  The ministry's main functions will be to devise the 
country's 
tourism development policy, to oversee the operations of the 
various tourism institutions, and to ensure the training of 
personnel, Cienfuegos explained. He said specialization and 
territoriality will be the basic principles that will support 
work in this area. 
  To this end, following the dissolution of the National 
Tourism Institute (Intur), Cienfuegos said three hotel networks 
will be created: Gran Caribe, Horizontes Hoteles, and Islazul. 
Maritime organizations will be grouped under the firm 
Puertosol, and hotel activity outside the mainland will be 
promoted in the territories by Rumbos Recreation Enterprises. 
There will also be a tourism company that will operate under the 
name Cubatur, in association with the Spanish air company 
Iberia, which has extensive experience and prestige in this area. 
  The defunct Intur was created in 1976 and was tasked 
exclusively with developing the incipient Cuban tourism industry 
until 1987, when the Cubanacan S.A. International Commerce and 
Tourism Corporation was created. Shortly thereafter, a third 
entity, the Gaviota S.A. Group, was added to the efforts to make 
tourism the biggest source of foreign currency on the largest of 
the Antillean Islands. Though on a lesser scale, these last two 
institutions also underwent structural readjustments this year 
aimed at achieving greater efficiency and quality in their 
endeavors. Their goal, together with the Tourism Ministry, is 
to achieve more than $1 billion in gross revenues for 1995. 
  According to Cienfuegos, last year's tourism sector provided 
the Cuban economy with between $700 million to $720 million (30 
percent more than in 1992) and brought 560,000 tourists to the 
country. This total is lower than the one foreseen but much 
higher than the total for the same previous period (488,300). 
Cuba received 243,000 tourists in 1985, 340,00 in 1990, and a 
little more than 424,000 tourists in 1991. 
  The country has approximately 24,000 hotel beds distributed 
throughout 11 tourism sites that offer the most varied 
recreation, from beach bathing, mountain climbing, and diving, 
to ecotourism and health tourism [turismo de salud]. 
  Development of the tourism industry has gained strategic 
importance, particularly at the end of the 1980's when the 
Socialist Bloc crumbled and the U.S. blockade was intensified, 
placing the island in a difficult economic situation. 
  To boost the sector's development, the Cuban Government has 
resorted to various types of associations (joint ventures, 
management contracts) with foreign companies. Up until now, 
these associations have involved businessmen from Spain, 
Germany, Canada, Jamaica, the Netherlands, Mexico, Colombia, and 
Italy.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (PL) -- The tourism industry will 
occupy the top place in economic importance this year because of 
its upsurge and the attention given to it by the state, an 
official of the recently created Tourism Ministry said here 
today. 
  At a news conference held in Havana's Hotel Nacional as part 
of "The Nation and the Emigrants Conference," Juan Jose Vega, 
one of the organizers from that ministry declared that growth in 
the sector averages about 30 percent a year. 
  He added that last year 70 percent of the products consumed 
by tourists were of national origin. He also stressed an 
increase in business with foreign companies, above all hotel 
management, which allowed -- he said -- the improvement of 
quality and service, as well as an increase in the number of 
tourists. 
  Other tourism directors, representing all the major chains 
and tour operators of the largest island in the Antilles, also 
attended the meeting. 
  Enrique Rodriguez Manzano, vice president of the Gran Caribe 
hotel chain, noted the great efforts made to achieve the quality 
required in the vacation industry. He said Cuba is gaining 
experience in this field and reinforcing it through instruction 
in schools that teach tourism. 
  On the other hand, Rodrigo Garcia, the representative of the 
Gaviota Group, Inc., emphasized the state's interest in 
promoting a new image of Cuba, stressing the family and 
children, as opposed to tourism based on sex. 
  On this issue, he added that steps were being taken to 
prohibit entry to "persons lacking the proper moral requisites 
into rest areas, as is normal in any other tourist center in the 
world." 
  Regarding this issue, Garcia said those social risks are 
lessened by the enormous expectations for tourism, which offers 
huge benefits for the Cuban economy. 
  It was indicated that, in actuality, only 544,000 
vacationers 
entered the country in 1993, based on actual immigration 
records. The previous figure of 626,000 had been based on the 
sale of package tours. 
  An estimated 800,000 tourists are expected to visit the 
island this year, and tourism is expected to reach 1 million 
visitors in 1995. The speakers at the conference said that to 
date 22-25 percent of visitors to the island were here on a 
return visit.

  [Text] Havana, 28 Apr (PL) -- Cuban emigrants who 
participated here in "The Nation and the Emigrants Conference" 
with Cuban authorities are the target of strong pressure, 
telephone threats, insults on radio programs, and even 
expressions of physical violence. 
  As newsman Marcos Castellon told PRENSA LATINA today in a 
telephone conversation, lawyer Magda Montiel Davis is the chief 
target of those attacks, in addition to Vivian Maneruc, owner of 
the ABC Charters company that flies airplanes from Miami to 
Havana. 
  On Thursday, Montiel's offices were evacuated following two 
bomb threats that turned out to be false, while most of her 
staff members resigned, voicing a deep fear for their personal 
safety, the source said. 
  He added that after leaving the building in the company of 
her husband, the lawyer's path was blocked by a hail of insults 
until the Miami police intervened to clear the way. 
  According to Castellon, other attendees like Maneruc also 
reported threats and requested protection, fearing reprisals by 
groups opposed to any peaceful rapprochement between Cuba and 
its emigrants. 
  On their return to Miami, the participants in the meeting 
with Cuban authorities were taken out of the airport terminal 
under strict security to prevent possible violent clashes with 
local ultraright-wing segments. 
  The political climate in Miami, the commentator of Radio 
Progreso Alternativa indicated, has been traditionally marked by 
the intolerance of the right, and there is a long history of 
bomb attacks and physical and verbal attacks on persons who 
support dialogue. 
  He recalled that two participants of the 1978 dialogue, 
which 
gathered Cuban emigrants for the first time in Havana, were 
killed. 
  Emigrant ultraright-wing sectors were excluded from 
participating in the meeting held 22-24 April. The meeting was 
regarded as the first step toward normalizing Cuba's ties with 
its emigrant community.

  [Text] Cartagena, Colombia, 26 Apr (PL) -- Today, a Cuban 
representative charged that the United States is still violating 
UN resolutions and deviating from the spirit of cooperation that 
exists in America by maintaining and intensifying the economic 
blockade against Cuba. The statement was made by Jorge Garcia, a 
member of the Cuban delegation to the 25th period of sessions of 
the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 
(ECLA), in response to a U.S. participant. 
  The U.S. delegate to the UN forum on regional economic 
mechanisms tried to respond to charges made this morning by 
Ernesto Melendez, state minister for economic cooperation. In 
his speech, Melendez described as incongruous the fact that his 
country continues to endure -- as it has done for over one-third 
of a century -- the U.S. imposed economic blockade amid a 
continental climate of commercial liberalization. A member of 
the Washington committee responded later, trying to justify the 
economic pressure on the Caribbean island with the same 
arguments used 30 years ago. 
  In his counterresponse, Garcia, an official of Cuba's State 
Committee for Economic Cooperation, recalled that Melendez based 
his charge on UN General Assembly resolutions approved by an 
overwhelming majority and by virtually all the representatives 
at the ECLA event. 
  Such documents have the fundamental objective of ending a 
blatant violation of international law and recognized principles 
of coexistence among nations, he stated. In reality, the 
blockade policy that even U.S. groups have begun to question 
lately has been intensified. 
  He added that Washington is seriously affecting the economic 
interests of U.S. businessmen. Garcia also termed Washington's 
policy of aggression against Cuba as disproportionate, unreal, 
and a failure to heed the call of the international community 
and U.S. allies by "disassociating itself completely from the 
spirit of cooperation" in ECLA. 
  "Cuba is a small country geographically speaking, but we 
will 
continue to grow if that is what it takes to defend our 
legitimate right to sovereignty and self-determination," Garcia 
stated.

  [Text] Havana, 27 Apr (Pl) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
awarded Zambian President Frederick Chiluba the Order of Jose 
Marti during an event honoring the African guest today. 
  The medal of the order, the highest award granted by the 
Cuban state, was pinned on Chiluba at the Palace of the 
Revolution during an official reception which his delegation and 
other guests attended. 
  Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member of both the Council of State 
and the Communist Party Politburo, cited the Zambian statesman's 
efforts in the struggle to eradicate colonialism and the 
disappearance of the obsolete apartheid regime. Balaguer also 
spotlighted Zambia's active role in the Nonaligned Movement and 
the Frontline Nations. 
  Chiluba expressed thanks for the award, saying this gesture 
strengthens the traditional fraternal ties between the two 
people, and he recalled Cuba's role in the liberation of several 
African countries. 
  He also said the end of the Cold War will lead to the 
establishment of a new international economic order and the 
achievement of a world in which equal opportunities will be the 
basis for international relations. 
  The Zambian president arrived here on 25 April for an 
official, friendly visit. It has been learned that he held 
official talks on 26 April with his Cuban counterpart to reach 
bilateral cooperation agreements in the sugar industry, 
agricultural, and health fields. 
  Speaking to national television, Chiluba said the Angolan 
situation and the processes related to the disappearance of the 
Soviet Union were among the international topics addressed 
during the talks. 
  The Zambian delegation was also honored today at the 
Biotechnology and Carlos J. Finlay Institutes, vanguard 
scientific institutions involved in the development of Cuban 
medicine. 
  The visiting president and his delegation are carrying out a 
tight working agenda that includes touring industrial, 
agricultural, health, and sports centers. 
  Sources from the two countries have said he will also meet 
with Zambian students who are studying in different Cuban 
provinces and African diplomats accredited here. 
  Chiluba, 51, concluded political, governmental, economic, 
and 
English studies in London and New York and union and industrial 
relations studies in Germany. He also has lengthy experience as 
a labor leader in such areas as health, construction safety, and 
labor productivity.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 26 Apr (PL) -- Guatemala's defense 
minister, General Mario Enriquez, admitted here today that after 
30 years of war it is impossible to defeat the guerrillas 
militarily. 
  In an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA, Enriquez said 
that, although the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity 
[URNG] forces barely number 900 men, it is difficult for the 
Armed Forces to thwart the guerrillas' mobility. 
  In view of a virtual impasse in the nation's armed conflict, 
Enriquez thinks the peace talks with the rebels are the ideal 
method to put an end to the ordeal that the confrontation has 
imposed on Guatemalan society. 
  Enriquez, a former member of the government team during the 
peace talks (1991-92), points to a certain ambiguousness in the 
rebels' political willingness in the negotiations, although he 
admitted there had been some changes. He also noted that a 
general agreement on human rights was signed in March and a 
schedule of 11 topics was included in the agenda for the talks. 
  The minister did not conceal what he described as excesses 
against individual rights perpetrated by the Army over the past 
three decades. He reported that the cases are in the courts and 
that the guilty parties will be punished. 
  According to the Guatemalan Catholic Church, in 1993, the 
Armed Forces were responsible for 248 summary executions and 245 
cases of forced disappearances for political reasons, all of 
which were blamed on paramilitary Civil Self-Defense patrols. 
  Enriquez accused the URNG of serious human rights 
violations, 
both of individuals and groups, as noted in resolutions issued 
by the Guatemalan Human Rights Ombudsman's Office. 
  Enriquez criticized the URNG's acts of sabotage against the 
nation's urban power grid and the intentional spilling of 
400,000 gallons of oil into the Maya preserve, one of the 
world's largest ecological preserves. 
  According to the minister, the Armed Forces have not 
received 
U.S. military aid since 1977. "Not one single cent. Washington 
even suspended several higher learning scholarships that had 
been provided at one time. While El Salvador has as many as 100 
helicopters, Guatemala does not have as many as two. We have 
had to develop our own infrastructure to conduct the war against 
the URNG." 
  Meanwhile, he noted that the URNG still receives some 
assistance from abroad, although this aid has diminished 
somewhat, judging from higher war taxes the guerrillas are 
exacting from residents within the conflict zones. 
  Finally, Enriquez denied that an eventual cease-fire will 
necessarily entail a reduction in the number of men in the Armed 
Forces because, he said, the Armed Forces contribute to the 
development of society and protect the nation's borders. 
Enriquez also spoke about the likely reorganization of the Army 
and the need to replace quantity with quality.

  [Text] Havana, 27 Apr (PL) -- Jose Antonio Ocampo, 
Colombian minister of agriculture and livestock, today began an 
official visit to Cuba with the goal of entering into 
cooperation accords with the Cuban Ministry of Agriculture. 
  Ocampo, who is visiting at the invitation of Cuban 
Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan, declared his trip is also 
aimed at achieving technological exchanges in the area of 
biotechnology, of which he recognized Cuba's prestige throughout 
the world. 
  "We also hope some Colombian enterprises establish 
commercial 
and investment relations in Cuba in such areas as rice 
production and poultry breeding," the minister of the South 
American country told the media. 
  Ocampo's visit to Havana is part of a series of contacts 
made 
by Colombian ministers and personalities with local authorities, 
in an attempt to develop and improve bilateral commercial, 
cultural, and diplomatic relations. 
  Recently, the Colombian health minister visited the island 
and last year President Fidel Castro accepted an official 
invitation from his South American colleague Cesar Gaviria.

  [Text] San Salvador, 27 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Member countries 
of the Association of Coffee-Producing Countries (APC) have 
decided to end today, Wednesday, the plan to retain coffee 
beans, because the bean has experienced an important recovery on 
the international market, official Salvadoran sources have 
reported. 
  Ruben Pineda, president of the Salvadoran Coffee Council, 
has 
told ACAN-EFE the coffee-exporting countries, headed by Brazil 
and Colombia, have decided to end the retention, because the 
pound of the bean has exceeded the minimum price of 80 cents on 
the world market. 
  "We received the notification at our offices this morning 
from the retention plan coordinating office, located in New 
York, stating there would be 0-percent retention as of today," 
Pineda has said. 
  The retention plan of the approximately 30-member APC 
countries started on 1 October 1993, negatively affecting 20 
percent of the coffee production in each country, but due to the 
success of the measure, producers decided to reduce retention to 
10 percent only four weeks ago. 
  Pineda has said the lifting of the retention plan "is good 
for our country, because we have reached a good level of prices 
on the world market," and he added El Salvador has only 
approximately 500,000 quintals (22,727 tons) currently retained.

  [Text] Power does not interest me. This is what the 
commander in chief of the Haitian Army, General Raoul Cedras, 
stated during an interview by LUMIERE NOIRE magazine. In this 
interview, the head of the Haitian Army recounted the facts 
which allegedly led to the 30 September [1991] coup d'etat. 
[words indistinct] to explain [words indistinct] that President 
Aristide had stirred up. He has always tried to push the 
institutions to the limit through the streets in order to get 
rid of any counterpower, eliminate some people, and terrorize 
possible opponents. He has always been a leftist militant. Even 
after he came to power through election, he was not able to 
differentiate between his revolutionary fervor and his new 
status as head of state, states Gen. Cedras, who advances three 
reasons for the attitude of the international community after 
the coup d'etat: 
  The principle of respect for elections means that if a 
president has been elected, he has the right to (?fulfill his 
mandate until it expires). He left on 30 September [1991]. The 
OAS immediately met to condemn Haiti without analyzing the 
situation first. I have noted that all the presidents who urged 
the OAS to take those measures -- Perez of Venezuela, for 
example -- were members of Socialist International, Gen. Cedras 
explained. 
  The third reason put forward by the head of the Haitian Army 
is solidarity among presidents because, even though there are 
three powers in a state of law, it is nevertheless the executive 
that prevails, Gen. Cedras explained. 
  Gen. Cedras says he is not in power. I am not at all 
interested in assuming power; I rely on the men of this country 
to find a solution. Power for power's sake is not an end in 
itself, but implies first the sense of responsibilities. In this 
conversation with LUMIERE NOIRE, Gen. Cedras also advocated the 
creation of a political center. It will be necessary, Gen. 
Cedras said, for the middle classes to take charge of (?one 
another), to play a political role in the noble sense of this 
word, to ally themselves in promoting a candidate of consensus 
and progress with a precise agenda and who can establish the 
sense of state, of national interest; all that would put an end 
to the personal ambitions of some and the external interferences 
of others. We must give rise to the emergence of a middle class 
that will be able to assume legitimately a new democratic power 
cleansed of all excesses. 
  Gen. Cedras appeals to the conscience of international 
opinion, of all honest democrats who have been misinformed. The 
truth is that in Haiti we had an electoral coup d'etat [words 
indistinct] through the ballot and opposed to any kind of 
organization and to all institutions lacking an agenda, lacking 
a code of ethics, and whose sole policy is to sow division and 
to give rise to hatred among the various components of the 
population by inciting [people] to murder, Gen. Cedras explained. 
  In the same magazine there is an interview with former 
Haitian President Leslie Francois Manigat, who spoke of an 
international coup d'etat within the scope of the situation in 
Haiti.

  [Text] The spokesman for President Aristide, Jean-Claude 
Martineau, has reacted to the antidrug operation led by the 
Haitian military authorities. The initiative has come too late, 
according to the president's spokesman. Martineau reaffirmed 
that the Haitian military authorities are involved up to the 
hilt in drug trafficking. 
  [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] A big drug dealer 
made 
a series of statements before the U.S. Senate, perhaps one week 
ago. He stated before a U.S. Senate committee that [Lieutenant 
Colonel] Michel Francois [Port-au-Prince police chief] is 
involved up to the hilt in drug trafficking. Obviously, it was 
not necessary for anyone to come tell us about that to know it. 
Besides, this is something that President Aristide has been 
denouncing for some times. We have heard that there is an 
operation aimed at arresting drug dealers in Haiti. Why are they 
trying to arrest those involved in drug trafficking (?only) 
after this accusation, when they knew about it previously? [end 
recording] 
  This was the spokesman for President Aristide, Jean-Claude 
Martineau.

  [Text] The Haitian Antidrug Brigade announced on 28 April 
that on 26 and 27 April it carried out an important search 
operation that resulted in the arrest of seven traffickers 
wanted by the police and the questioning of 27 other persons. 
The operation led by this brigade, with the help of tracker dogs 
trained in the United States and mixed units of the capital 
police, resulted in the recovery of arms and ammunition and the 
seizure of an unassessed amount of marijuana. Among those 
arrested are two Colombians holding false Dominican passports 
and one Dominican. The three will be extradited to their 
countries of origin very soon. 
  Haitian antidrug services have pointed out that Colombian 
citizen Orlando de Jesus Arena Alvarez, 44, who was extradited 
to Bogota on 20 April after he had been arrested following a 
four-year stay in Haiti under a false Venezuelan identity, had 
been sought by the Colombian Justice Department as one of the 
leaders of the Medellin Cartel.

  [Text] Today, National Action Party President Carlos 
Castillo Peraza said the Tijuana police security director, who 
was gunned down last night, had information on the assassination 
of Institutional Revolutionary Party presidential candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. Castillo said his party repudiates and demands 
an investigation of the assassination of party member Jose 
Federico Benitez Lopez, municipal public security director in 
Tijuana, and Benitez' bodyguard Ramon Alariz. 
  [Begin Castillo recording] First, we repudiate the crime. 
Second, we demand a thorough investigation. Third, we appeal to 
the citizens of Baja California, who apparently have been 
selected as the target for intimidation, to behave civilly, 
politically, lawfully, and peacefully. [end recording] 
  Speaking to this station, Castillo said Benitez had given 
information to the Special Deputy Prosecutor's Office in charge 
of investigating Colosio's murder and that on 29 April he 
planned to talk to deputies and senators who are members of the 
commission created to investigate the crime. 
  [Begin Castillo recording] It is surprising, worrisome, and 
alarming that Benitez was assassinated the day before that 
meeting would have been held. [end recording] 
  Castillo added that the violence in Mexico provoked by some 
groups is an attempt to create a climate of insecurity and fear 
in the country. 
  [Begin Castillo recording] Cardinal Posada's assassination, 
the outbreak of violence in Chiapas, the kidnappings with which 
we are all familiar, Colosio's assassination, and now this 
murder all look like an attempt to create a climate of fear and 
terror in Mexico, which runs contrary to all civilized 
coexistence and the interests of those of us who are fighting 
for democracy from many angles. [end recording] 
  Castillo said the people should do everything possible to 
defeat crime, terror, unlawfulness, and violence.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast; passages within quotation </F>
marks recorded] 
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, during the 
opening of the 5th National Stock Market Convention, has assured 
that the incidents that have occurred in Mexico change neither 
the unity nor strength of the Mexican people's undertakings 
  [Salinas] "We will not change our course, nor will we be 
slowed down; on the contrary, in government institutions we are 
more intent on joining the new times." 
  During the ceremony at Los Pinos, the president affirmed the 
commitment to act based on law and through dialogue. 
  [Salinas] "When faced with criminal actions by individuals 
or 
gangs, the Mexican States have confirmed their willingness to 
respond with the full strength of the law. Through dialogue, we 
will face legitimate social claims while recognizing our growing 
plurality." 
  The president said Mexico's economy can develop further, and 
he reconfirmed the stock market's growing importance in the 
state's modernization. 
  Manuel Robleda, Mexican Stock Exchange president, said that 
under this administration, the volume of operations in the stock 
exchange has increased 2.8 times, whereas the world's main stock 
markets have increased only .24 times. He spotlighted 
investments made by stock companies and the financing of stock 
for $27 billion for the production sector, and he acknowledged 
the development of the Mexican stock market must grow further. 
  Luis Miguel Moreno, president of the National Securities and 
Exchange Commission, said that under this administration, 142 
public offerings of shares have been made for more than 39 
billion new pesos in Mexico and abroad, an unprecedented amount 
in the stock exchange's 100 years of operation. 
  [Moreno] "The Mexican stock market, as an open system, has 
been hurt by recent unexpected events; nevertheless, the market 
has indicated that even under adverse, temporary situations its 
level of maturity is greater and its institutional structure 
more solid." 
  Moreno said that during this current temporary situation, 
there will be no change of course, nor will the rules of the 
game be modified to take advantage of short-term conditions or 
temporary benefits. 
  [Moreno] "The authority of the stock market is adhering to 
its main goals, market integrity, and the guarantee that its 
operations take place under equal opportunities, thereby 
protecting the general interest of investors." 
  Pedro Aspe, finance and public credit secretary, and Miguel 
Mancera, governor of the Bank of Mexico, also attended the 
ceremony.

<F P=106> [Report by Daniel Pensamiento from Chiapas] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez -- Mexican Army troops have 
traveled to an area 5 km from the peasant settlements of Yalcoc 
and El Encanto and to the communities of Progreso and Gabino 
Vasquez, near the Lacandona Jungle, where they are digging 
trenches to assume positions. Journalists have toured the area 
and ascertained the Army is building two new camps where 
soldiers will be posted until fighting resumes or peace is 
signed. 
  A military checkpoint installed in El Encanto, 10 km east of 
Chiapas, was moved 5 km toward the Lacandona Jungle during the 
first half of January. The soldiers installed their 
sophisticated weapons and radio communications equipment there. 
  The military chiefs are issuing orders for the deployment or 
transfer of troops headquartered in Progreso and Gabino Vasquez 
from their provisional headquarters in Yalcoc. Chiapas residents 
have reported there was a routine mobilization of troops on the 
streets of that town. "Trucks have suddenly arrived loaded with 
numerous soldiers who were posted at the municipal presidency 
and the park to apparently stand guard in the area," said 
residents who have requested anonymity out of fear. 
  Agricultural laborers found the remains of Humberto 
Hernandez 
Conde, a municipal police agent who was presumably kidnapped by 
the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] in early January. 
  Julio Latty, municipal police commander in Comitan, reported 
a group of peasants found Hernandez' remains in San Antonio 
Zeta, 7 km east of Comitan. "The peasants reported their 
finding, and we immediately traveled there and recognized the 
former police agent by his shoes and parts of his uniform," 
Latty has said. He recalled that Hernandez had been presumably 
kidnapped by EZLN members in early January, when he disappeared.

  [Text] A drug trafficking group that transports marijuana 
and cocaine from southern Mexico to cities bordering Texas has 
extended its Mafia execution arm to Nuevo Leon, where five 
people have been murdered. Of the six apparent narcotrafficker 
murders in 1993, five occurred in municipalities located close 
to highways and places where Federal Judicial Police [PJF] had 
previously discovered shipments of tons of marijuana. 
  The bodies of the murdered men were found in the towns of 
China, General Bravo, Cadereyta, and Santiago. Another murder 
took place in Mina, and according to investigations by the State 
Judicial Police, the suspects in that crime are linked to the 
murders in China and Cadereyta. 
  The Monterrey-Reynosa Highway is toll-free, and the PGR 
[Attorney General's Office] has seized tons of marijuana there. 
It is also a place where drug traffickers have "settled 
accounts" several times. Drugs coming from Oaxaca and Michoacan 
States usually go to Reynosa, Matamoros, or Ciudad Mier. 
  The PJF got involved in drug trafficking activities in 1993 
when Commander Jorge Guzman Torres, aided by "godmothers" 
["madrinas"], kidnapped Lauro Gonzalez Garcia. Police 
identified the kidnapped man as a drug trafficker, and he paid 
federal agents 200,000 new pesos for his release. 
  The PGR has confiscated shipments of tons of marijuana on 
the 
highway between China and General Bravo and in country houses in 
Cadereyta and Ciudad Benito Juarez. PGR actions, which led to 
the confiscation of almost 5 tons of marijuana, took place a few 
days before or after the body of a murdered man was found. 
  Merchants Gaspar de Jesus Sandoval Rodriguez and Martin 
Garcia Rodriguez, alias El Guero Martin, were executed in 
January. The following month, the PGR seized 2.376 tons of 
marijuana in two actions. 
  On 9 February, just seven days after finding the body of 
Garcia Rodriguez, alias El Guero Martin, the PJF seized a ton of 
marijuana in a tractor-trailer operated by two people. The PJF 
also found 1.376 tons of marijuana in a house on the San Isidro 
de Cadereyta estate on 20 February. They also arrested two men 
who were loading the drugs into a Suburban. 
  On 28 February, Lauro Gonzalez Garcia, suspected of 
executing 
Sandoval Rodriguez, was kidnapped by PJF Commander Guzman Torres 
with the complicity of "godmother" Cuauhtemoc Labastida Salazar. 
The association between the PJF and the drug traffickers ended 
when Gonzalez Garcia paid 200,000 new pesos for his release. 
  Lawyer Octavio Leal Moncada and physician Javier Salinas 
Perez are said to be suspects in the death of Garcia Rodriguez, 
alias El Guero Martin, for alleged joint business transactions. 
Leal Moncada, however, told a Prosecutor's Office investigator 
that Garcia Rodriguez was his friend, and the physician asserted 
that the murdered man owed him 700,000 new pesos. During a 
special operation, the PJF unsuccessfully attempted to arrest 
Labastida Salazar, who was accompanied by Leal Moncada at the 
time, in his house in Colonia Las Brisas. The "godmother" and 
the lawyer are currently fugitives. 
  Although the PGR arrested two alleged members of a drug 
trafficking band in General Bravo in January, they were 
investigated as members of a marijuana and gunrunning group in 
June 1993. This month, Francisco Garcia Martinez, an employee of 
Angel Avila Neri, came to EL NORTE to personally report that the 
PGR is persecuting his boss and three other people. 
  The PGR established that Avila Neri was a ringleader whose 
accomplices included Jose Santos Rodriguez Cantu, alias La 
Pinina; brothers Martin and Jorge Arizpe Gonzalez; Jesus Antonio 
Gutierrez Gonzalez, alias El Zurdo; Juan Aguilar Gonzalez; and 
"Lalo" Solis. 
  On 9 August, Margarito Hernandez was murdered in Cadereyta, 
allegedly by Horacio Montelongo Salinas, during a discussion 
over drug debts. The alleged killer is the brother of Jose Luis 
Montelongo Salinas, a suspected drug trafficker who was later 
murdered in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Jose Luis Montelongo was 
also a suspect in the murder of Gaspar de Jesus Sandoval 
Rodriguez. 
  Almost a month after Margarita Hernandez's murder, the PGR 
confiscated half a ton of marijuana that they found buried in a 
trench in a Colonia Monte Bello house in Ciudad Benito Juarez. 
Two other important actions carried out between 6 and 9 November 
resulted in the seizure of 2.565 tons of marijuana; the first in 
Ciudad Benito Juarez and the other on a train heading for 
Matamoros. Five days later there were two murders; one in 
General Bravo and another in Santiago. 
  The PJF found 396 kg of marijuana in the cellar of a house 
in 
Colonia Lomas del Solo in Ciudad Benito Juarez on 6 November. 
The PJF went to the house because two women reported the 
presence of the drug when they were arrested with a shipment of 
168 kg of marijuana in their vehicle. On 9 November, the PJF 
seized two tons of marijuana in a train boxcar. 
  Those confiscations presaged the murder of Abel Salazar 
Martinez, who was found in General Bravo on 14 November. He had 
disappeared from his home in Weslaco, Texas on 8 November. Jaime 
Enrique Lopez Castillo's body was found 15 days later at the 
13-km marker of Santiago-Juarez Highway near the La Boca Dam. 
Lopes Castillo had also been murdered. 
  The year 1993 ended with a "war" among alleged drug 
traffickers and a "settling of accounts" in General Bravo. 
  The homes of Jose Santos Rodriguez Cantu, alias La Pinina, 
and Martin Arizpe Gonzalez were strafed by AK-47 rifle fire. 
The Caballito de Mar Restaurant, owned by Angel Avila Neri, was 
also bullet riddled. Fourteen days after the attacks in General 
Bravo, the PJF arrested two alleged members of the Avila Neri 
band, which had been under investigation since June 1993. 
  Juan Jose Cantu Gonzalez and Raul Gutierrez Gonzalez were 
presented as members of the "Jabali" guerrilla commando, which 
was planning terrorist actions in Nuevo Leon. Later the PGR 
retracted and said they were only drug traffickers and 
gunrunners. 
  The Sixth District Judge ordered Gutierrez Gonzalez' release 
as he believed him innocent of storing weapons and cartridges 
and of illegally possessing and transporting marijuana with the 
intent to take it out of the country. 
<H5>  Houses searched </H5>
  The PGR continued its investigations in the state to 
discover 
the drug network headed by Matamoros Cartel chief Juan Garcia 
Abrego. A special PJF group has searched several houses and 
country homes in Monterrey in the past months to find evidence 
against the partners of the so-called drug capo. The state PGR 
delegation also wants to identify the safe houses and the 
marijuana and cocaine distribution centers. 
  So far, the searches have not resulted in the arrest of any 
of the alleged drug traffickers. Several people whose houses 
where searched assert they have no ties with Garcia Abrego.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] This morning, the U.S. Government announced 
modifications to visas issued for travel to the United States. 
I am going to explain the communique they sent us, which has 
somehow led to confusion. I will explain what will happen with 
the so-called border-crossing visas [mica]. There will not be 
changes with regard to indefinite border-crossing visas. 
[sentence as heard] All other visas stamped on your passports, 
even those that read indefinite, will no longer be so. 
  In keeping with a worldwide effort to make the automatic 
handling of visas more efficient, three years ago the U.S. 
Embassy began issuing nonimmigrant visas which are read by 
computers. These have a maximum validity of 10 years. 
  Therefore, starting on 1 January 1995, all indefinite 
validity visas issued before 1 January 1995 will be canceled. 
In addition, after 1 January 1995, indefinite visas will not be 
valid after 10 years of their issue date. Nonimmigrant visas 
are those issued to tourists, businessmen, students, and other 
persons who travel temporarily to the United States. 
  In their communique, they posed some questions to try to 
clarify the doubts the public may have. One says: What will 
happen with the indefinite visas already issued? Beginning on 1 
January 1995, indefinite visas stamped on passports will be 
canceled 10 years after their issue date. For instance, visas 
issued before 2 January 1985 will not be valid as of 1 January 
1995, and an indefinite visa issued in 1990 will be valid until 
the year 2000. 
  Another question formulated is: What must people holding 
indefinite visas on their passports do? They must revise their 
date of expiration, which will not exceed 10 years, and take 
steps to obtain a visa for only 10 years, if expired. I repeat, 
indefinite visas will no longer exist. 
  Will this policy affect border-crossing visas, Form I-186? 
No. This measure only affects those whose indefinite visas are 
stamped on their passports. If you are holding an indefinite 
border-crossing visa, there is no problem. 
  Evidently, this has generated reaction. Why has the U.S. 
Government taken this position? Here in our country, some 
pronouncements were made on the issue. Foreign Relations 
Secretary Manuel Tello ruled out the restriction of U.S. visas 
to 10 years starting in 1995 as being an anti-immigration 
measure, which is obviously what people thought at first. 
  Let us listen to Marcela Gutierrez: 
  [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] Foreign Relations Secretary 
Manuel Tello ruled out the 10-year limit of U.S. visas as being 
an anti-immigration measure by the United States. On the 
contrary, he indicated, the U.S. visa policy is very generous. 
  [Tello] If I receive a visa that is valid for 10 years to 
visit a country, I would think it is a very generous visa. I 
repeat once more, we grant foreigners visas to visit Mexico for 
only 180 days. 
  [Gutierrez] The foreign minister reiterated our country will 
not modify the duration of the visas issued to foreigners. 
Interviewed at the Foreign Relations Secretariat, Manuel Tello 
stated it is the exclusive responsibility of the U.S. Government 
to decide the duration of the visas. 
  Finally, he concluded it is not irregular that with the 
commercial opening, the government of the neighboring country 
decided to limit indefinite tourist visas to 10 years. [end

NAFTA to settle the tuna embargo imposed by the United States on 
the country, which has caused economic damages estimated at 
approximately $50 million to date. It reported 70 percent of 
the national fishing cooperatives have gone into debt to balance 
their financial situation, and 60 percent of them have been 
forced to restructure their debt with the banks. 
  This past year, the number of cooperative boats in the 
Pacific has been reduced 25 percent and the number of private 
fishing boats has also been reduced by an equal percentage. By 
contrast, the number of foreign investment projects in this 
sector is increasing, particularly as regards to the development 
of aquiculture and fishing in territorial waters. 
  Juan Jose Moreno Sada, Sepesca federal delegations 
coordinator, and Geronimo Ramos, director of International 
Fishing Affairs, made the aforementioned statements at a news 
conference, in which they also announced the 94 International 
Fishing Fair, from 8 to 12 June at Boca del Rio, Veracruz. 
  Moreno Sada explained there is an encouraging outlook in the 
fishing sector, because the recovery of this economic activity 
began in 1993. That year, production increased 3 percent, 
basically from the reactivation of shrimp fishing and higher 
domestic consumption of tuna. In 1994, this sector is expected 
to maintain its rate of growth and exports, which total about 
$500 million, will grow by 20 percent throughout the year, 
reaching $750 million in the next three years. 
  He said fishing cooperatives are steadily recovering and may 
even be capitalized because 310 of these companies have received 
financial backing to support their reactivation. Of the $250 
million the fishing cooperatives owed to date, $150 million have 
been restructured, leaving only 40 percent of the credits to be 
renegotiated. 
  The importance of this lies in the fact that the bread and 
butter of approximately 300,000 families comes from fishing 
cooperatives, and that last year the number of boats in this 
sector declined from 600 to 450, namely one out of five boats 
stopped operating. 
  Geronimo Ramos, director of International Fishing Affairs, 
addressed the difficult topic of the tuna embargo. Regarding 
this topic, he said Mexico has worked hard to reduce the 
accidental death rate of dolphins, to the point it reached a 
statistical rate of "zero." This is because in the last few 
months, a 0.4-percent dolphin accidental death rate was achieved 
for tuna fishing, thereby achieving international standards in 
tuna fishing; however, the elimination of the U.S. embargo has 
not been obtained. 
  Asked if Mexico will resort to NAFTA to negotiate the 
elimination of this commercial sanction against the country, 
Ramos answered that the authorities have not ruled out resorting 
to Chapter 20 of the Treaty regarding the solution of 
controversies to settle this problem. 
  Meanwhile, the official explained that enormous interest by 
foreign businessmen to invest in the fishing sector has been 
observed. He stated there are currently a $100 million in 
projects to be made in the country with U.S. and European 
capital. 
  The modification of the fishing law promoted two years ago 
paved the way for opening the possibilities for private capital 
participation and investments have flowed. For instance, this 
year there are projects involving such Spanish companies as 
Costa Brava, Nueva Galicia, and O'Farril Valenciana, the 
investors of which are particularly attracted to aquiculture 
projects and fishing in territorial waters, especially in Baja 
California Norte and Sur, and in southeastern Mexico.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Mendoza on statements by Cuauhtemoc </F>
Cardenas, presidential candidate for Mexico's Democratic 
Revolutionary Party, PRD, during a tour of Los Angeles on 27 
April; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said he has not noticed any U.S. 
meddling in the Mexican electoral process and asked the Clinton 
administration to continue to respect Mexican positions and 
decisions. Cardenas said internal problems will be solved by 
Mexicans themselves and added that if he wins the election, he 
wants a mature, close, productive, respectful, and equal 
relationship with the United States to solve bilateral problems. 
  Cardenas offered guarantees for investment to help generate 
jobs and said he would promote changes in NAFTA to address 
critical omission in that agreement, such as the immigration 
issue. The PRD presidential candidate also pointed out that the 
United States has reason to be concerned about instability and 
the elections in Mexico because any negative event in Mexico has 
an impact on U.S. social, economic, and political life. 
  Cardenas assured that he would assume total responsibility 
for improving NAFTA. I am convinced, he added, that gradually, 
through a dialogue between friends, we can find ways to modify 
this agreement. It is a cornerstone for a new, imaginative 
cooperation structure. Nevertheless, he indicated that his view 
of NAFTA has not changed. 
  The presidential candidate said immigration issues are one 
area where he has found critical omissions in the treaty. This, 
he noted is not only the most important issue in the 
relationship with Mexico, but it also has the greatest potential 
for controversy. Cardenas criticized U.S. politicians who 
exploit chauvinism and racism in their xenophobic campaigns 
against Mexicans. 
  He said investment is important, but it is not the essential 
ingredient for economic success. He stated that if Mexicans are 
to live up to their potential, liberty and a state of law must 
be guaranteed throughout the North American market. Cardenas 
added that his main goal is to restore true democracy and 
justice to a society that has been ruled for too long by 
authoritarian decisions, patronage, and corruption. 
  As I reported this morning, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas also said he 
supported the observance of the Mexican electoral process by 
people abroad, by international observers. Cardenas said they 
should be present not only on election day but that they should 
already be in Mexico to learn about the whole electoral process. 
  In terms of the debate he will hold with other parties' 
candidates, Cardenas said that tomorrow, the PRD will hold a 
first meeting with Adolfo Aguilar Zinzer [newspaper commentator] 
and representatives of the Institutional Revolutionary Party and 
the PAN [National Action Party] to decide upon the terms of the 
debate. Cardenas said there was a problem with the date fixed 
for the debate but that they are willing to be flexible. 
  This is the general information in broad terms. Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas is currently meeting with members of the Mexican 
community, PRD members in California, and Mexican-Americans 
assembled in downtown Los Angeles. Several Los Angeles 
personalities and leaders of the Democratic Party and of liberal 
and so-called progressive organizations will attend an evening 
event in Beverly Hills. Cardenas will meet early tomorrow with 
LOS ANGELES TIMES and LA OPINION executives. Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas concludes his tour of Los Angeles tomorrow. He said no 
other visits to the United States are scheduled in his political 
campaign.

<F P=106> [Article by Eva Lozano Estrella] </F>
  [Excerpt] Tula de Allende, Hgo [Hidalgo], 28 Apr -- 
Francisco Rojas Gutierrez, Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) director 
general, has warned there are risks and pressure tactics, mainly 
by the United States, to privatize the country's petroleum 
industry. This is why, he said, the best way to maintain the 
parastate company as a public company is to avoid 
ineffectiveness, inefficiency, and the lack of productivity; 
otherwise, the state will be forced to place the tapping of 
crude oil "in hands more capable than its own." 
  In a brief interview, the official pointed out that insofar 
as we appreciated the country's social harmony for many years, a 
harmony that remains broken for the time being, we must also 
appreciate the government's efforts to not negotiate the tapping 
of crude oil within the framework of NAFTA. 
  As Rojas highlighted the need "to be more efficient, 
productive, and capable" to keep Pemex away from the world trend 
of privatizing national petroleum industries, as currently faced 
by such countries as Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Russia, 
among others, he said the pressure tactics of 1938, when the 
industry was expropriated, are the tactics currently used to 
have Mexico transfer the tapping of its petroleum reserves under 
the old argument that "we Mexicans lack the capacity to manage 
our crude oil." 
  As he unveiled a plaque to mark the opening of the second 
Catalytic Disintegration Plant at the "Miguel Hidalgo" Oil 
Refinery, owned by Pemex, Rojas noted that the political stature 
shown by the Mexican oil industry while negotiating NAFTA, a 
time when the Mexican Government did not negotiate the tapping 
of its national petroleum reserves, has yet to emerge. 
  After opening this new facility, which will provide 24,000 
gallons of Magna Sin gasoline for daily domestic consumption, he 
admitted there is international pressure to induce the 
privatization of the world's national enterprises, as is the 
case in Venezuela, where there is unlimited access to its oil 
industry because of the government's inability to make it more 
efficient. To that effect, during his speech to oil union 
members, the Pemex director general said in view of the domestic 
and foreign pressure, the uncompromising defense of the oil 
industry kept the country's sovereignty over its energy 
resources unharmed. In his 9-page speech, Rojas estimated that 
the best way to defend Pemex is to avoid inefficiency and lack 
of productivity; otherwise, Pemex will be forced to cede its oil 
to more capable hands. 
  Further on, he stressed the endeavors that the law 
stipulates 
as exclusive rights of the state, through Pemex, were not ceded. 
He added that thanks to the oil policies of the current 
administration, there is full confidence hydrocarbons will 
remain Mexican property. 
  During the event also attended by Hidalgo Governor Jesus 
Murillo Karam, Rojas said five years into the Carlos Salinas 
administration, changes have broadened, the country has evolved, 
inflation has been successfully controlled, and public finances 
have been cleaned up. Now, the challenge is to create more and 
better paying jobs because only productive and well-paid workers 
can guarantee all Mexican families welfare and good quality of 
life, he added 
  During his visit to the Catalytic Disintegration Plant, the 
construction costs of which amounted to $135 million, the Pemex 
director general stressed the Mexican Government's commitment to 
fight pollution. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The chemical industry will oppose the accelerated 
elimination of tariffs under NAFTA, according to Arturo Garcia, 
president of the National Chemical Industry Association. He said 
it is wrong to follow this course at this time because NAFTA is 
still quite new and the three countries involved are just 
starting to obtain benefits from the trade pact. 
  He also told EL FINANCIERO that this sector had decided not 
to enter into any trade commitments until it received guarantees 
that the treaty would benefit the industry. He also noted that 
current negotiations with Venezuela and Colombia are "stalled" 
because the Venezuelans have asked that the policy on the origin 
of goods be made flexible. This situation has cast doubts that 
the treaty will only benefit those countries that signed it. 
  Interviewed at his office, Arturo Garcia admitted that 
NAFTA, 
which was signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, 
includes a provision that the signatories can request the 
accelerated elimination of tariffs on a number of products as 
part of the regular treaty regime. The chemical industry, 
however, is not willing to give up the advantages it achieved in 
the NAFTA negotiations. 
  Garcia recalled that with the treaty, the industry obtained 
a 
10-year moratorium on tariff elimination on almost all its 
products because the sector proved it required a transition 
period to reduce its tariffs to zero, and "this was accepted by 
all three parties." What the industry will do, he said, is offer 
the United States and Canada a list of products whose tariffs 
can be eliminated immediately because these were not included in 
NAFTA and are not produced in the country. 
  It has to be very clear, however, that the chemical industry 
will not ask any tariff be eliminated on products in response to 
the document. "We will only offer, for their acceptance, a few 
highly specialized products that we do not have in Mexico." The 
industry's position is firm: Let the text of the treaty remain 
as it was negotiated. 
  Referring to the negotiations with Costa Rica and Chile, as 
well as those with the United States and Canada, Garcia said the 
chemical industry is very pleased with these talks because the 
policy on origin of goods was accepted in those talks. 
Unfortunately, he added, negotiations with Venezuela and 
Colombia have encountered problems because of the chapter that 
covers rules on origin. Those two countries want this chapter 
to be weak or very flexible, and this does not guarantee that 
goods from those industries in which Mexico is competitive will 
flow to those two countries.

Parastate Industry minister has reported that the Mexican 
Government today opened a pilot plant to manufacture nuclear 
fuel to be used by the Laguna Verde Nuclear Plant, which is 
located on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The pilot plant, 
situated in the State of Mexico near Mexico City, was built at a 
cost of about $10 million, and, according to the minister, it 
was constructed "in line with the strictest security and quality 
standards." The minister added: Experts of the International

  [Text] In light of the upcoming elections and the 
subsequent change of government, the Permanent Agrarian Congress 
(CAP) has demanded recognition as an interlocutor in the 
drafting of a national project and an agricultural development 
strategy, as well as recognition as an advocate of the country's 
political and socioeconomic development. 
  The CAP believes it is important to give peasants greater 
access to posts of democratic representation to ensure that 
agricultural problems are discussed as "national high-priority" 
issues. In exchange, the CAP commits itself to promote voting 
in the countryside and to fight abstentionism because this is 
how to channel the social and political demands of this sector 
to the state. 
  This organization, made up of 11 national peasant 
associations, warned that if the government fails to modernize 
itself and to allow new local, regional, and national 
politicians, it will continue to slowly lose its legitimacy, 
thus promoting the emergence of new opposition groups. 
  In its document entitled General Guidelines To 
Preparing the CAP Proposals To Modernize the Countryside With 
Social Justice, which will be discussed on 30 April and 1 
May by all CAP members and will eventually be submitted to the 
new president, the CAP demands political democracy and insists 
that the new "countryside politicians" cannot be left out of the 
decisionmaking process and the drafting of policies geared 
toward the rural social sector. 
  In its analysis, the CAP highlighted the Chiapas issue and 
the need to amend Article 27 of the Constitution and to upgrade 
the Program of Direct Support to the Countryside (Procampo) to 
constitutional rank. The CAP also believes that at least $4 
billion must be earmarked for Procampo annually and that expired 
portfolios from official and commercial banks must be written 
off. 
  The CAP also noted its decision to join the national peace 
and reconciliation efforts because "neither armed nor legal 
violence is good for anyone." The organization maintained "all 
interests at stake are legitimate;" thus, it suggested "a 
reconciliation by way of compromise." 
  The CAP document, which will be discussed within the 
organization, indicates "the only condition we demand is justice 
and understanding. Should we pay any costs, these must be fair, 
and we must have the absolute guarantee that socioeconomic and 
political benefits will be fully enjoyed." 
  The document, which includes statistics on the evolution of 
international prices for basic grains and on production and 
harvesting costs, states the following: "The costs incurred and 
sacrifices made during a reform must be limited; should they not 
be evenly and fairly shared, any modernization project will 
fail." 
  As the CAP added that the end of paternalism means autonomy 
for the rural social sector, not a "divorce from the state," the 
organization, which will mark its fifth anniversary this year, 
stressed: "Accepting socioeconomic development is not populism. 
We demand fair conditions to compete at the level of the NAFTA 
trade partners." 
  As it addressed political issues, the CAP pointed out it 
already planned to meet with all presidential candidates to know 
beforehand their projects for the countryside and to make sure 
"our organizations will have solid foundations on which to 
choose a candidate." The organization also said its members 
agreed to "work for the opening of opportunities in the 
decisionmaking of the institutions involved in the fight against 
abstentionism and in the campaign to convince people to vote. 
As political entities, we cannot be left out of the drafting of 
political decisions." 
  The agrarian organization believes strategic alliances are 
necessary at all stages of primary production, 
industrialization, and commercialization to be "competitive in 
final, selective, or intermediate markets. The alliances and 
commitments among our organizations, industrialists, and 
businessmen are essential for each one of us, always under the 
possibility of being straightforward and complying with the 
already signed agreements."

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de Las </F>
Casas; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] The National Action Party's [PAN] presidential 
campaign tour through Chiapas today could be described as a 
three-part operation. The first part was a meeting between 
presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos and San 
Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz. It was funny because those of us 
trying to follow him found this rather difficult. By driving a 
little fast, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos managed to avoid the 
reporters' pursuit. We later learned what he discussed with the 
bishop during the meeting. His main question about the peace 
process was why we have someone who has no relation with Chiapas 
on one side and someone whose identity is unknown on the other 
negotiating peace and reconciliation in Chiapas? Diego 
Fernandez de Cevallos called on the political parties to 
participate in the process because it is urgent and necessary 
for them to be a part of the talks. 
  After midday, he moved on to the community of Navenchauc and 
met with PAN members, who voiced their woes and petitions. They 
complained that they were not allowed to go to a specific 
temple, just for being PAN members. The people say they are not 
allowed to build any community projects. The municipal 
presidents of San Juan Chamula and Xinacatan, primarily, will 
not grant them any loans or provide the resources they need 
because they are not members of the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party. They also say they are barred from the community 
decisionmaking process. They believe they are worth nothing. 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos said something that caught many 
people's attention: I am not God, nor do I have the gift of 
magic, but I hereby promise to talk with you and settle these 
differences, especially with your authorities. 
  Without a doubt, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos' main event of 
the day was to take place in San Cristobal de Las Casas. And 
that it was, because it has already concluded. He gave what he 
called his famous San Cristobal de Las Casas Proclamation of 
April 1994. These are the six main points of his proclamation, 
which was broadcast live by a local radio station here in 
Chiapas and beamed nationwide, via satellite. These are his 
words: 
  [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] Ladies and 
gentlemen: I deeply thank you for being here, and I thank Radio 
640 for the opportunity to broadcast this message to the people 
of Chiapas. It is also being broadcast to the whole nation via 
satellite. This is a manifesto to the people of Mexico from the 
PAN. 
  1. The PAN hereby and definitively reaffirms today, as it 
always has, its humanistic, pacifist, and democratic proposal. 
We therefore call upon all Mexicans of good faith to join a 
grand national effort directed at giving the nation a truly 
democratic government, a government that will promote unyielding 
respect for human rights, encourage the community to produce for 
the benefit of the people, contribute to improving our judicial 
system, and guarantee the full implementation of the state of 
law. 
  2. We strive for a profound change in the way the government 
exercises its power, so that power will always and without 
excuse be subjected to just laws for the benefit of the people. 
  3. We reject the current economic model, because it has 
concentrated wealth in a disgusting way and has impoverished 40 
million Mexicans. We demand and propose an economic system that 
will serve all human beings, always be subjected to ethical 
standards, and generate equal opportunity for all in the 
generation and distribution of national wealth. 
  4. We intend to seriously and extensively promote the states 
of the Federation and all of the country's municipalities, by 
way of a true political, economic, and social federalist system. 
Presidential centralism is the source of all the evil and 
injustice that oppress and degrade the nation's life. It denies 
the sovereign rights of the states of the Federation; it 
subordinates the country's municipalities by way of a rampant 
and often murderous autocracy. 
  5. We call for an educational program, in which the 
government and the community must work together. We must 
encourage the overall development of all human beings, but with 
respect for their dignity. This we must attain while 
strengthening the cultural, ethnic, religious, and ideological 
plurality that characterizes Mexico. 
  6. The PAN, in keeping with its history of democratic 
civic spirit, strongly says no to violence. It supports an 
honest, respectful, and sincere dialogue in favor of justice and 
peace. We reiterate the need to achieve the maximum 
participation of Mexican society and its institutions in a 
dialogue based on truth that can lead us to a national 
understanding. We emphasize the importance for peace of a 
dialogue between the government and the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN]. We categorically support the dialogue 
and we hope honorable agreements result from it. We refuse, 
however, to even believe that representatives of the president 
of the republic and of the EZLN can define and compromise the 
life and institutions of Chiapas and of Mexico. 
  In our opinion, ladies and gentlemen, from this dialogue we 
must expect a civilized agreement between the government and the 
EZLN to legally promote without delay the duties aimed at 
resolving the conflict. We believe the argument that hunger and 
injustice generate violence. We insist that peace cannot be 
attained if justice is not achieved first. True peace is based 
on reason. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the message of the PAN 
in San Cristobal de Las Casas on 25 April 1994. 
  [Signed] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate to the 
presidency of the republic. [end recording]

Council of State to analyze the national financial situation. 
This will thus close a process which included the entire nation 
at the grass-roots level -- an unprecedented popular 
consultation through the conduit of forms of democracy unlike 
those frequently imposed as the only form of government by the 
hegemonic centers of power. 
  On the basis of these considerations involving the conduit 
of 
democracy and the clear differentiation of that conduit, the 
problem to be debated tomorrow by our deputies is directly tied 
to one of the main challenges -- not the only one -- of our 
economy: A currency excess nearing 12 billion pesos. 
  This means that there is an enormous surplus between the 
purchasing potential and the actual supply of products and 
services available. Technically, when this happens, the 
purchasing power of the currency drops to such extremes that it 
is not able to regain its capacity through a rational increase 
in production. In our case, the shortage of energy, oil, and a 
series of resources due to well-known reasons, does not allow 
for a significant increase in production. 
  The excess currency is one of the financial problems of our 
economy -- not the only one. There are others tied to the 
collection of currency through diverse fiscal measures also 
affecting the required financial balance. 
  Measures have been taken regarding this extremely urgent 
matter, such as the reorganization of the administrative 
apparatus of the central government. However, in our case, we 
have to find solutions without implementing shock policies; in 
other words, without massive layoffs, and acute increases in 
prices to lower the excess currency and attain a healthy but 
socially unfair demand. 
  This is what it is all about. We have to adopt the measures 
needed without abandoning the social character of the function 
of the state in the economy. Social, not only due to the nature 
of production but also due to the final beneficiary of the 
national economy. 
  The deputies have before them an urgent task. This process 
will probably not end with this special session. It is a matter 
of taking indispensable steps to redesign our economy on an 
economically feasible basis without affecting the workers 
unfairly or massively. The Revolution will not leave anyone 
abandoned. That is an unquestionable principle.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Maribel Acosta] </F>
  [Text] We all know that the special session of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] will be held on May 
Day to give continuity to the debate on the national financial 
situation. The public debate process of the workers assemblies 
was conducted between January and March. This process 
highlighted for the ANPP the policies to be followed. 
  In accordance with a poll conducted nationwide in March by 
the Sociology Studies Center among 1,404 workers, 87 percent 
believe that the workers assembly process was worthwhile. 
Likewise, 71 percent of the workers affirmed that the workplace 
debates contributed to creating an awareness of the true 
situation of the Cuban economy. Regarding the proposals and 
suggested measures to streamline the internal finances, 56 
percent of the workers believe that the measures will gradually 
solve [passage indistinct], while seven percent do not see a 
relation between measures and an improvement in the Cuban 
economy. 
  Statistics reveal that it is evident there is a high 
consensus on the need for economic measures, although, opinions 
differ on the shape they ought to take. Some 39 percent of the 
workers believe that the measures ought to be taken separately 
and gradually; 25 percent believe the measures should be taken 
separately but quickly; and 27 percent believe the measures 
should be taken quickly and all at once. According to this poll, 
which also shows a high level of democracy in the opinions 
expressed, the measures with more widespread support are 
reducing frivolous gratuities, eliminating the regulated sale of 
cigarettes and rum, increasing the cost of electricity the 
higher the consumption, and implementing a more active price 
policy aimed at subsidizing people rather than products. 
  However, in my opinion, we ought to give more attention to 
certain indicators revealed by the poll. For example, there is 
not a clear enough understanding that economic measures will 
affect everyone's living conditions to a different degree. 
Fifty-five percent of the workers responded yes to the question: 
Should we all receive the same? This shows a deeply rooted 
egalitarianism. The poll also confirms the people's consensus on 
the need to work more and shows the value of public discussion 
when 64 percent of the workers stated that the country will move 
ahead. 
  The opinion of the specialists is that the workers 
assemblies 
yielded the positive result of increasing trust and hope in the 
possibility of Cuba's reversing the current economic situation. 
  On May Day the ANPP will meet; we know the expectations. The 
ANPP will debate, compliment the consensus, and draft policies 
on how to solve the current financial situation. Then it becomes 
the government's responsibility to implement the policies 
drafted by the ANPP.

<F P=106> ["Text" of article by Susana Lee published in GRANMA on 30 </F>
April] 
  [Text] Tomorrow at 1000, the Cuban national anthem will 
mark the opening of the special session of the National Assembly 
of the People's Government [ANPP] convened by the Council of 
State to analyze the economic situation of Cuba. This meeting is 
the conclusion of an entire debate process on this issue and it 
will be in the hands of the ANPP deputies, as representatives of 
the Cuban people who elected them, to define the policies, the 
main paths of work that can be adopted to correct gradually the 
national economic imbalance. 
  Just as planned [passage indistinct] of the issue at that 
moment and to take it up again in a special session, the 
delegates are better prepared in this instance and with the 
information obtained from a broad survey conducted by the union 
movement through the parliaments in the workplace process. Three 
million workers actively participated in over 80,000 workers 
assemblies between January and March 1994. 
  Last December's ANPP discussion of these vital and 
controversial issues, which the mass media amply divulged to the 
people, was unprecedented and worthwhile. Even much more 
unprecedented is the fact that these issues were brought before 
millions of Cubans that discussed, frankly and openly, these 
issues and put forth ideas and proposals aimed at solving the 
complicated economic and financial problems that we face today. 
  What place in the world can boast of having conducted a 
similar process? What parliament or parliamentarian can in 
addition to discussing and deciding on the matters that affect 
the whole of their population, also be aware of their people's 
opinions on these issues? 
  I can go even further, which is worth noting the day before 
May Day, when hundreds of labor union representatives from all 
over the world have come to partake in the May Day celebrations 
and a number of them are invited to witness the debates of the 
ANPP: In what country are the workers or even their union 
leaders consulted on such crucial issues? What country or 
government would risk consulting their work force about such 
problems and ask for their opinions? In how many places have 
workers awakened to the news that those famous packages of 
measures had been implemented? In other words, neoliberal 
formulas to solve their financial woes at the cost of the more 
humble sectors. 
  Tomorrow, when the ANPP deputies -- representing the people 
who elected them in true elections through secret and direct 
ballot with over 50 percent participation as regulated by law -- 
decide from their seat the policy to be followed to correct the 
financial situation, in a broad spectrum, a situation on which 
millions of Cubans have expressed our opinions, all of which 
have been taken into consideration, we will be taking one more 
step on the path chosen by a true majority of our people to 
resist and overcome the great obstacles we face and moving 
forward. What is decided at this meeting, it is good to repeat 
it, will not be a shock policy nor can we presume that all 
solutions will be popular although we hope they will have the 
understanding of the population. Absorbing the excess currency, 
as explained on other occasions, due to the drastic reduction of 
our capacity to import and the stiffening of the Yankee 
blockade, is an impossible task without a certain measure of 
sacrifice shared by all of us. Call it what you may: Increase in 
the price in some products, eliminating gratuities, establishing 
a tax system, reduction of subsidies to unprofitable enterprises 
thus reducing the budget deficit, and restraint and elimination 
of profitteering. 
  In last December's ANPP meeting there was a favorable and 
broad consensus on these measures, the same as in the 
parliaments in the workplace. These measures are inevitable and 
needed to promote adequate conditions to be applied to our 
economy to subsequently solve the basic problems of the economy. 
We have started to work on this by implementing other important 
decisions; such as a reactivation of production, an increase in 
productivity, and improving economic efficiency. This will be 
done while preserving our accomplishments and, as Fidel said, 
safeguarding, above all, the interest of the people. This will 
be kept in mind, and the Revolution will not abandon anyone, 
this an indisputable principle. 
  Tomorrow, when the ANPP special session commences, its 
deputies, invested with the highest responsibilities, will 
undertake their tasks as homage to Cuba's May Day, with the 
honor, sense of dignity, revolutionary and patriotic spirit of 
our working masses, their commitment to fight and save the 
Revolution and the accomplishments of socialism, and their amply 
proven political awareness.

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betancur from the Havana Convention </F>
Center; from the "Morning Information Review"] 
  [Text] This morning at 1000, 551 deputies, including Cuban 
President Fidel Castro, opened the general assembly of the 
National Assembly of the Peoples' Government [ANPP]. The 
discussions began with the one single issue on the agenda of 
this first special session: cleaning up the country's domestic 
finances. 
  Union delegations from several countries that flew to Havana 
to participate in the 1 May International Labor Day celebrations 
are present. ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon recalled the wide 
and intensive discussion on the main problems of the country's 
domestic economy. These discussions took place at each of the 
approximately 80,000 so called parliaments in the workplace, 
with the participation of 3 million workers and almost 58,000 
cooperative farmers at 60,000 general assemblies and thousands 
of university students. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] The extensive consensus that 
clearly rises from those meetings is the will of the 
overwhelming majority of Cubans to continue resisting, to 
continue struggling to save the fatherland and its revolution. 
Within this same framework and in this same spirit we, the 
members of this national assembly, must now continue that 
process of collective debates and take the needed measures 
accordingly. [end recording] 
  Before studying the document that was distributed among the 
deputies, Pedro Ross Leal, general secretary of the Cuban 
Workers Federation, took the floor. He told the assembly about 
the main issues that surfaced during the workers' discussions. 
He said this session is the best way to celebrate 1 May in Cuba 
at this specific moment. 
  The main objective of this parliamentary encounter is to 
present the government with specific proposals, to suggest 
measures it can gradually implement to try and develop a 
systematic economic policy that could clean up the domestic 
economy. The proposals and measures are based on company 
profitability, work incentives, and preservation of the Cuban 
revolution's social achievements.

  [Text] With Commander in Chief Fidel Castro present, the 
morning session of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [ANPP] debated measures by which to correct the 
economic situation. Deputy Lazaro Barrero stressed to the plenum 
the need for a monetary reform that should include the 
confiscation of illegally obtained money, a change in currency, 
and the freezing of excessively large bank accounts. 
  Otto Rivero Torres, president of the Federation of 
University 
Students, stressed to the ANPP plenum the importance of 
increasing control and standards in universities. 
  Other deputies emphasized greater state control over 
enterprises providing essential services to the people, to 
prevent the deviation of essential resources required by the 
people. 
  Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers 
Federation, saluted Cuban workers in his address to the ANPP 
special session that began this morning at the Convention 
Palace. Ross stressed that we are observing 1 May by working and 
seeking appropriate solutions to the current crisis. Ross went 
on to say that in the last two months Cuba has lived a great 
event in the realm of labor, the Parliaments in the Workplace. 
Ross explained that the matter of correcting the economic 
situation was very much present in the debates that took place 
in these meetings of workers, which once more demonstrated the 
workers' unconquerable faith in the Revolution. 
  Cuba's economic imbalance, manifested by the 11.636 billion 
pesos in excess currency, is the reason that proposals for 
correcting the economy are being evaluated. 
  Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez gave an 
address detailing some of the proposals and measures under 
study, among them an increase in the prices of certain 
nonessential products such as cigarettes and alcoholic 
beverages. In the case of cigarettes, the changes will not 
affect the present categories of distribution. The new prices 
will be two pesos for a regulated pack, six pesos for extra 
packs, and 10 pesos for unregulated packs. This will require an 
adjustment in production. With reference to alcoholic beverages, 
the proposal is to establish differentiated prices according to 
their type and category. 
  The proposals of the minister of finance and prices to the 
ANPP special session included a selective increase in prices and 
rates for public services. In that sector, to raise the price of 
electricity could be an effective method of increasing the 
revenues to the government's budget. The study conducted and 
presented to the ANPP by Jose Luis Rodriguez proposes charging 
nine cents per kilowatt to consumers who do not exceed 100 kw 
monthly. The consumers who use between 100 and 300 kw monthly 
will pay 20 cents per kilowatt. Consumers who use more than this 
amount will be charged 20 cents extra. 
  Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez explained 
that the measures under study to correct the economic crisis 
will constantly make allowances for the lower income sector of 
the population. The elimination of subsidies to various products 
and the allocation of these subsidies to the people in the 
lowest income brackets is also under consideration, in order to 
enable them to cope with the selective increase of prices in 
various sectors. The proposals under study in the ANPP special 
session include increasing the current rates for telephones, 
postal services, and automotive fuel; the latter could mean 
doubling or tripling the present cost per liter. Under 
consideration is the possibility of charging entry fees to 
specified cultural and sports events, which could convey over 8 
million pesos to the national budget. 
  Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez explained 
that, with the objective of covering the costs of workers' 
dining halls, one proposal includes a decentralized setting of 
prices that would be easily adjusted to the conditions and 
quality being offered. Rodriguez added that one proposal is to 
charge boarding school students for lunches; a minimum fee of 35 
cents could produce an annual revenue of 29 million pesos. 
Rodriguez pointed out that the proposals, including lowering 
subsidies to students, exclude the low income sector of the 
population. 
  The ANPP special session is also discussing measures such as 
taxes on personal income, documents, properties, and water 
service. The proposed cost for water service is one peso a month 
per person. 
  The address by the finance and prices minister mentions the 
possible change of the currency for a convertible peso. Changing 
the Cuban peso was described as feasible and it was announced 
that several alternatives have been studied toward this end. 
Likewise, the possibility of strengthening the value of the peso 
by gradually increasing the quality of goods and services was 
described. Regarding the state, the Finance and Prices Ministry 
proposal includes the reduction of subsidies that resulted in 
losses of 1.3 billion pesos this year; this will make it 
possible to reduce the fiscal budget by 24 percent. The 
possibility of selling personal insurance is also under 
consideration, as are diverse means to stimulate bank savings 
accounts in order to remove from circulation the largest 
possible amount of currency.

  [Text] Havana, 1 May (NOTIMEX) -- Osvaldo Martinez, 
chairman of the Economic Commission of the National Assembly of 
the People's Government, said that his country will implement a 
socialist economic model with private property, market laws, and 
the strong presence of foreign capital. 
  In an interview published this Sunday by the government 
weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE, Martinez said the island's authorities 
must find solutions in a capitalist market ruled by 
monetary-commercial laws. 
  The publication of this interview coincides with a special 
Assembly session during which Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and 
prices minister, outlined a strict adjustment program which, he 
insisted, is not a neoliberal shock plan. 
  The Assembly member said the search for efficiency in the 
island's economy is "a matter of life or death", with only 31 
percent of the enterprises producing an income, according to 
official figures. 
  The official added that 1994 continues to be difficult for 
the Cuban economy, but the first signs of long-term recovery are 
being seen. 
  Martinez said tourism represents the first positive aspect 
of 
the Caribbean country's economic activities, with a growth rate 
of 30 percent per year; and, according to government sources, it 
will surpass the sugar industry as the country's main source of 
income. 
  The National Assembly leader said that increased production 
of domestic oil, with its high sulfur content, is expected to 
exceed last year's 1.1 billion tons in 1994. 
  The exploitation of new forms of state-owned lands, where 
former employees now organized in cooperatives have the right to 
use the land, has resulted in an increase in the production of 
food, he said. 
  The state has a monopoly on the marketing of new 
cooperatives 
that have replaced inefficient state-owned farms that were 
operated by agricultural workers for a salary. 
  According to Martinez, the measures adopted by the 
government 
to put its internal finances on a sound basis will have positive 
effects in the near future, although its essential effects will 
need no less than a year and a half to mature. 
  Martinez said Cuba will leave the crisis behind by the end 
of 
the century "by resuming the economic growth process but also by 
achieving a different economy -- qualitatively speaking." 
  It must be an economy in which we have a strong state sector 
that sets guidelines and operates more through decentralized 
mechanisms in which economic considerations play a more 
important role than administrative considerations, he explained. 
  The legislator said that plans for this model will involve a 
much more important role for the market and a strong presence of 
foreign capital, which Cuba has encouraged since the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union and the Eastern European 
socialist bloc. 
  In Martinez' opinion, these changes do not alter the 
essential basis of Cuban society, which is compelled to forge 
ahead in a world ruled by capitalism. 
  The economy will still be socialist, which means that 
political decisions will be made by the central government and 
that politics will rule the economy, meaning it will be 
subordinate and aimed at achieving the goals of socialism, 
Martinez said.

  [Text] Havana, 1 May (EFE) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
said today that the measures that must be adopted to put the 
economy on a sound basis "are hard and difficult" and warned 
that "we cannot take half measures." 
  In an address to the National Assembly, which is holding a 
special session today to decide what measures will be adopted, 
Fidel said: "I do not think it would be worthwhile to do 
nothing, to stop halfway, because it would be a disaster if the 
measures we adopt are insufficient." 
  "We are far from having a full idea of the problem; not even 
the comrades with a better education have it, although we have 
certainly made progress," the Cuban leader added. 
  Castro referred to the series of proposals presented this 
morning by Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, who outlined 
the need to create a tax system, reduce some subsidies and 
benefits, increase prices for nonessential products, and create 
a convertible currency, among other things. 
  Castro added: "Everyone is prepared to find solutions, but 
no one wants to pay taxes on their salary or to have even a cent 
cut from their salary. Everyone wants a solution but they want 
solutions without having to take these types of measures." 
  Castro termed the country's current economic situation as a 
"cancer" characterized by over 11 billion pesos in circulating 
money, which has virtually nullified the purchasing power of the 
national currency, and a 1993 public deficit of 4.2 billion 
pesos. 
  "A human policy of solidarity with the people that neglects 
no one involves a surplus of circulating money -- which is 
tolerable for some time -- but, within the special period, the 
time has come to solve the problem, and that is not so easy," 
Fidel Castro said. 
  He insisted that it is necessary to carefully decide what 
must be done so the situation does not reoccur. He said that it 
is necessary to "get to the root of the problem," otherwise "it 
would be a tremendous waste of time." 
  "We must create real solutions," the Cuban leader said after 
concluding that there "is no other choice but to take measures 
that are part of the special period, a special period that is 
much worse than we ever imagined."

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betancourt in Havana] </F>
  [Text] More than 30 deputies participated today in the 
debate on the measures that the Cuban state must implement to 
put its internal finances on a sound basis, the only topic 
included on the agenda for the first special period of sessions 
at the National Assembly of the People's Government. 
  Armed with an arsenal of ideas contributed by the 
parliaments 
in the workplace and the report presented by Jose Luis 
Rodriguez, finance and prices minister, Cuban deputies had 
enough arguments to propose solutions to reduce the deficit and 
the amount of excess money in circulation, which jeopardize the 
island's economic efforts. 
  In the midst of this heated debate, Cuban President Fidel 
Castro spoke in his role as deputy. Fidel said the policy of 
justice and social solidarity, maintained by the revolution even 
during times of crisis, is basically responsible for the 
imbalance that now afflicts our internal finances, adding that 
the time has come to solve the situation once and for all. 
  [Begin Castro recording] Above all, we must be courageous. 
We must be not only intelligent but courageous. If we are 
afraid, we are lost. If we implement half measures we are lost. 
History has given us the responsibility of solving this 
problem. We have to solve it, and in the end we must assume the 
responsibility with political sense, with revolutionary sense, 
and with an (?technological) sense. [end recording] 
  Referring to this, he said we must adopt the necessary 
measures, even those that are unpopular. 
  [Begin Castro recording] This is not a matter of simply 
putting our finances on a sound basis; it is also a matter of 
revaluing money. It is necessary to revalue workers' salaries; 
to revalue the peso. They are equally important issues. They 
are (?decisive) things, and I believe we should be willing to 
adopt whatever measures are necessary [applause] even if no one 
wants to speak to us the next day. [applause] Even if they do 
not want to greet us the next day or even in the coming months. 
  None of the measures will be welcome, nor will they be 
understood in only one day. Only the sum of these measures will 
be understood. Only the sum of these measures will yield results 
and increase the people's understanding. These measures must 
have an order. It is not a matter of adopting any measure today 
and any other measure tomorrow. The measures must have a [word 
indistinct] order, because the order of the steps has an impact 
on the results in this case. [end recording] 
  To conclude, Fidel Castro emphasized that every effort has 
been made to carry out the most democratic process of 
discussions, to hear various criteria, and to take the people's 
opinion into consideration. In other words, the strategy is 
well-known, but discretion must prevail at all times, he said. 
  The special session will continue tomorrow with the 
discussion of a draft agreement on the issue, which will be 
undoubtedly improved by the contributions from Sunday's debate.

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro said here in Havana 
that the country will have to win its economic battle with 
intelligence, perseverance, and courage, adding that experts and 
politicians alike will have to assume the responsibility that 
this entails by implementing a package of measures to put the 
country's internal finances on a sound basis. 
  During the first day of special sessions at the National 
Assembly of the People's Government, the Cuban leader said that 
the current situation of excess currency was created by a human 
policy adopted by the revolution to leave no one destitute 
during the special period. This, he added, has created an 
excess of money in circulation that is no longer tolerable. It 
must be solved by doing things correctly so the problem does not 
occur again. 
  Fidel Castro said: We have gained the workers' understanding 
after the issue was discussed at the parliaments in the 
workplace, nevertheless, some people do not understand. They 
will only understand when measures follow one another and when 
they are able to fully realize that it is necessary to implement 
them. 
  Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and prices minister, had 
previously said that the measures must be adopted in an orderly, 
disciplined, gradual manner, adding that it will take up to 18 
months to link one measure with the next. The outlined measures 
include a reduction in the budget deficit, a possible exchange 
[canje] of currency, the freezing of bank accounts for a 
specific time -- offering guarantees to account holders and 
hitting those who have illegally amassed fortunes. Rodriguez 
also expressed the need to strengthen the Cuban peso, to review 
incentives given to priority groups, to increase prices of 
nonessential products and of electricity and telephone rates, 
and to implement a tax policy. 
  Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the economic commission at the 
National Assembly of the People's Government, agreed with the 
Cuban finance minister but added that, in his opinion, the 
exchange of currency must not be considered only when it is 
appropriate, not as the first and only solution. 
  The special session is being attended by 551 deputies and 
will resume work on Tuesday.

  [Text] During today's session of the National Assembly of 
the People's Government [ANPP], Jose Luis Rodriguez, Cuba's 
minister of finances and prices, pointed out that there is a 
consensus on raising prices on products such as cigarettes and 
explained how its implementation would be beneficial. He also 
referred to studies on charging for services which have been 
designated as nonessential gratuities. He acknowledged that the 
most controversial point of discussion has been the tax system. 
  [Begin Rodriguez recording] Nevertheless, other taxes are 
placed on the income of specified citizens who, because of their 
job or other reasons, obtain incomes that have another level of 
interpretation. Such is the case, to give an example, of the 
taxes on self-employed workers who are charged a fixed fee. This 
measure has been applied nationwide. 
  There are other types of taxes that people pay, which have 
been discussed. Today, it was reported that the population has 
paid those taxes and does not question them as much. We could 
mention the tax on vehicle registration, known as the tax on 
tags; the tax on documents, which is paid with stamps; the tax 
to transfer properties, as in the case of inheritances. In other 
words, there is a series of taxes that the population has been 
paying and that does not cause so much perplexity among the 
people. 
  I would say that the highest level of concern has been on 
income taxes, which have not been supported massively even 
though some workers have expressed themselves in favor of this 
tax. [end recording] 
  Jose Luis Rodriguez concluded his intervention today at the 
ANPP session by stating that these measures would be incomplete 
without the repression of money hoarders. 
  During a recess of this session, Jose Luis Rodriguez said 
that the proposals presented by the Ministry of Finances would 
be implemented gradually, depending on ANPP decisions. 
  [Begin Rodriguez recording] I believe it will be up to the 
government to examine, in this group of measures which will 
presumably be recommended by the assembly, their appropriateness 
according to the timing and the degree to which each one of the 
measures is introduced. [end recording] 
  But according to the criteria of Cuban economists, the 
restructuring of domestic finances is not enough to change the 
current economic situation. Such was the opinion of Manuel 
Millar, vice minister of finances and prices. 
  [Begin Millar recording] As the workers explained during the 
workers parliaments, it is about creating the conditions to 
achieve an increase in production, a higher value of the 
national currency in order to stimulate more interest and 
greater productivity and efficiency by the workers. It is not 
only important to produce, but to produce efficiently, at the 
lowest cost, trying to do the most with the scant resources we 
have, to be able to increase our exportable goods and increase 
the supply of goods and services to the population. Our future 
success is based on this and the final consequences of all the 
plans and measures that are being proposed to the ANPP. [end 
recording] 
  According to specialists, public debate will be vital in 
achieving political effectiveness in the application of these 
adjustment measures. Those were the words of Dario Machado of 
the center of social-political studies. 
  [Begin Machado recording] It is not only vital, but 
inevitable. Because among the traits of our populations's 
political culture is the participation in general and national 
issues. It has been a practice of many years' standing. I can 
mention the debate of the call to the congress, or the debate 
for the draft of the Constitution prior to being submitted for 
referendum, and many other occasions on which the people have 
had the opportunity to participate. [end recording] 
  Even before the conclusion of the debates, Hortensia Chong, 
a 
base-level deputy, commented on the transcendental importance of 
ANPP decisions. 
  [Begin Chong recording] Our people expect us to reach the 
decisions that will allow us to establish the conditions so that 
our country can take off, and we can offer the people better 
living conditions within the next few months and years. That is 
why I say that this moment is historic. [end recording] 
  It is significant and distinctive that this parliament began 
with the intervention of the secretary general of the Cuban 
Workers Federation [CTC], who explained the results of the 
public debates, an order that seems logical to observers and 
essential to the Cuban people.

  [Text] Assemblies for economic efficiency will be held at 
every production and service center from 15 May to 30 June 
following the pilot process which has been described as 
favorable for the union movement. [passage indistinct] 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] 
basically as result of the workers assemblies held nationwide? 
  [Unidentified speaker] Exactly. The assemblies were a 
special 
moment where the working class was able to express itself on 
economic efficiency in the workplace and the measures to be 
adopted to streamline finances. The experience of having 
discussed specific aspects of the economic efficiency in the 
workplace showed that we had to give continuity to that issue, 
the framework to do this will be the space formerly dedicated to 
the production or service assemblies. Now the assemblies for 
efficiency will be aimed at this precisely: To discuss 
efficiency in the workplace, to discuss specific aspects of work 
and measures to take so that the work in every work center, 
either service, production, education, or health is conducted 
more efficiently; to have budgeted units make a more adequate 
use of their budget; to have health units provide more efficient 
service to the population, thus better using the budget 
allocated to that task. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How can the working class contribute 
to make this -- we will not call it a package of measures -- but 
this new revolutionary offensive imposed by the times to make 
the country operate more efficiently? 
  [Unidentified speaker] Precisely, the process of the 
assemblies for efficiency will begin massively after 15 May. One 
of the issues which we have to discuss necessarily is the 
results of the National Assembly of the People's Government 
[ANPP] session on 1-2 May. Whatever results from this, the 
recommendations made, the measures the government will alter or 
implement, as well as others already in place, will have to 
necessarily have the support, consensus and committed actions of 
the workers. Otherwise, any measure adopted will not be 
effective. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon; from the "Evening </F>
Information Review" program] 
  [Text] If the U.S. economic blockade were lifted, Cuban 
emigrants could invest in the island in prioritized areas, such 
as those devoted to promoting exports. When addressing the 
plenum of The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, Cuban Vice 
President Carlos Lage confirmed emigrants are not deprived of 
the right to invest in Cuba, although the specifics of that 
process are pending definition. 
  Future facilities for Cuban-born entrepreneurs are part of 
the process of normalizing relations with the expatriate Cuban 
community, the first part of which involved holding the 
aforementioned conference in Havana last weekend. At that time, 
the Cuban Government launched a number of measures aimed at 
normalizing ties with emigrants, among them eliminating the 
requirement that those who leave the country legally wait five 
years before returning. 
  Young emigrants will also be permitted to study at Cuban 
universities provided they defray the cost. Travelers will not 
be required to pay for a hotel room upon arriving on the island, 
and the Foreign Relations Ministry will create a special 
department to deal with the affairs of the expatriate Cuban 
community. 
  Possible emigrant investment in Cuba in the near future 
complements the aforementioned measures and reveals the 
soundness of previous steps taken to reach the decision. 
Recently, a meeting between Cuban officials and Cuban-American 
owners and businessmen, known in the United States by its 
acronym OCA, was held in Havana to explore the possibility of 
joint ventures. 
  A desire has been expressed by both sides, but that desire 
is 
stumbling upon the obstacles of the U.S. economic blockade, 
worsened by the implementation of the so-called Torricelli Law. 
The same emigrants, who met recently in this capital in The 
Nation and the Emigrants Conference, agreed on the need to lift 
the blockade because, in addition to threatening the very 
existence of 11 million Cubans, it blocks the normalization of 
ties between Cubans on and off the island. 
  As stated by some of the participants at the Havana 
conference, the Cuban economic opening is being blocked by the 
stubborn isolationist policy of Washington.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Lawyer Magda Montiel from Miami by </F>
Zenaida Costales, no date given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Upon her return to Miami, Cuban emigre Magda 
Montiel, who met with Commander in Chief Fidel Castro following 
the closing of the Nation and the Emigre Community conference 
last weekend, is confronting the ire of Miami's terrorist 
cliques. 
  [Begin recording] [Costales] Lawyer Magda Montiel has not 
committed any crime, yet is the target of harassment and threats 
from the far right of the Cuban emigre community of Miami. All 
she has done is participate, in her fatherland, in a conference 
between emigres and representatives of the Cuban Government. 
  [Montiel] The things we have heard are things neither one of 
us could have ever imagined. Not only that, I cannot go out. We 
are constantly under police protection. 
  [Costales] Have you been given the protection you requested? 
  [Montiel] Yes. We are under continuous police protection at 
office and at home. I am not able to go out. There have been 
protest rallies even in my neighborhood. I cannot go out. 
  [Costales] What are you planning to do? 
  [Montiel] I do not know what I can do. I am living from 
moment to moment but it is constant, the bad news, and protests. 
Yesterday, I was unable to leave my office. 
  [Costales] Have you been able to make it to your house? 
  [Montiel] Yes. But I cannot even tell you where I am. 
  [Costales] I understand. How is your family, so far? 
  [Montiel] Okay, so far. 
  [Costales] Magda, tell me something, from a judicial point 
of 
view, can anything be done? 
  [Montiel] No. They get permits to hold the protests, and 
there are the calls, threats, bomb scares, and all my employees 
resigned. 
  [Costales] We were aware that something had happened, we got 
news, and know that the far right has intensified their attacks 
and have made lists of people for the simple act of coming to 
Cuba. We are aware of this. This is why we call you to know how 
you are doing and what has happened. We are, of course, against 
that. 
  [Montiel] There are certain hours when the telephone calls 
never stop, the insults, bomb scares, and ugly, ugly upsetting 
things. It is a constant torture to have the telephone ringing 
off the hook and not be able to go out, and having to have 
bodyguards and police protection, and worrying about the 
children and the fear of sending them to school. No one should 
have to live this way. 
  [Costales] Of course, not. That is unfair. We agree with 
you. 
  [Montiel] What I am telling you is barely the surface. You 
can not imagine. I guess in a few days they will find something 
else to do and perhaps the situation will get somewhat calmer. I 
am a prisoner. I cannot go out. 
  [Costales] Magda Montiel cannot be harassed by the simple 
fact of visiting Cuba. Makes sense? That is what I think. 
  [Montiel] That is what I am saying. For me, the irony of the 
whole affair is that you turn on the television to see Nixon's 
funeral where he is being treated as a great hero and see me 
portrayed as a traitor. I keep telling myself: My God, I have 
not been caught buying cocaine, or killing anyone, or molesting 
children. What is going on? 
  Zenaida, the most important thing is that I have kept my 
dignity and position. I have not sold out. There are people who 
have told me to ask for forgiveness to save my family. Others 
have told me to say that as a lawyer I had a case I was trying 
to solve and that is why I acted so. I have maintained my 
position and may God decide. Hopefully, it will have a peaceful 
ending, and my children and I will not be harmed. 
  [Costales] We are aware that you have remained firm because 
we have heard certain things. All we can say is that we keep you 
in our thoughts and are tracking the news. We will call you 
again. We trust everything will come out fine. 
  [Montiel] Thank you very much. So long. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by Carlos </F>
Zanabria Marrero at Antonio Maceo International Airport, 
Santiago de Cuba, on 29 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Zanabria] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has 
accompanied the Zambian president in his visit to Santiago de 
Cuba. Since yesterday, Radio Rebelde, and particularly the Doing 
Radio program, has been reporting on the campaign of violence 
unleashed against the Cuban emigres who participated in the 
Nation and the Emigre Community conference. What is your opinion? 
  [Robaina] I believe that to any Cuban who truly feels the 
process we are undergoing, and is particularly interested in and 
wishing to establish normal ties, such attitudes require nothing 
else but the most determined and timely rejection. I believe 
that this shows the political barbarism of the far right of that 
Cuban community. This demonstrates the behavior of those we have 
called hysterics. When we announced the conference and stated 
that hysteria was not invited, I believe that the hysteria, 
seeing itself not invited, refused to relinquish a forum and its 
forum continues to be hysteria. 
  However, I am fully convinced that hysteria is challenged by 
valor, dignity, and courage. This is why I believe that people 
such as Magda [Montiel] and hundreds of others, who have yet to 
become the target of these attacks ....[pauses] I believe we 
have to realize that they act in this manner because we have 
touched a nerve. Anything promoting civilized reconciliation, a 
common path, and the kind of understanding that took place in 
the conference, hurts them. 
  I do not believe that this requires comment. In my opinion 
what this requires is boldness, valor, and commitment. What I 
want to stress is that Cubans such as Magda, who acted and 
continue to act as they have done, will not lack the support, 
backing, understanding, and solidarity of those of us here. [end

  [Text] In an interview with reporters, Vice Foreign 
Minister Isabel Allende gave her very personal impressions 
regarding the harassment that Magda Montiel, participant in the 
Nation and the Emigre Community conference, is suffering in 
Miami. Journalist Roberto Cavada recorded part of the interview 
with Allende. 
  [Begin Allende recording] In the first place, I was very 
surprised that Magda Montiel was being harassed simply for 
having come to Cuba for the Nation and the Emigre Community 
conference, a meeting that had clear and specific goals: to find 
formulas to normalize relations, find paths, and listen to the 
emigre community. 
  Those emigres came from all over the world. They came to 
express ideas which have been considered by the Cuban 
Government. As a result of her participation -- at least from 
what I heard on Cuban radio during the interview with Magda -- 
she is now in a very difficult situation. Magda sounded very 
upset and I believe I even heard a child crying in the 
background. 
  I believe this is incredible and I believe any honorable 
human being would feel the same way. It is a behavior that only 
right-wing extremists could have, people who are obviously very 
far from being faithful to principles that they claim to defend 
around the world: principles such as pluralism, freedom of 
speech, and freedom to be faithful to one's principles. 
  I believe Magda Montiel has been faithful to her principles. 
She has principles and ideas, and she came here to express those 
ideas, not to agree with ours. Let us assume that one of our 
ideas were involved -- and I am not saying that is the case -- 
but let us assume that Magda were to agree with one of our 
ideas. Is that a crime? Is that a felony? Is that sufficient 
reason to harass her as people were harassed during fascist 
times or during the most reactionary periods? I am truly 
appalled by this. 
  I believe that what is happening in Miami, far from 
benefiting the far right, in the long run -- and I am saying in 
the long run, which is my personal opinion -- will make many 
people ask questions, not only in the United States, but outside 
of the United States. It should make thousands of Cubans in 
Miami, and in all parts of the world, who did not attend the 
meeting or were not interested in the meeting ask why people 
behave this way. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Radio Rebelde answering machine calls with host Roberto </F>
Cavada -- passages within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] [Cavada] I have a caller in connection with the 
Miami far right attacks against Lawyer Magda Montiel. Good 
morning. 
  [First unidentified speaker] Good morning, Cavada. I wish 
the 
Miami people were listening to Radio Rebelde right now to tell 
them that the Cuban people are very proud to have welcomed Mrs. 
Montiel to Cuba. She is an honorable woman and she is 
demonstrating right now the character of Cuban women such as 
Mariana Grajales. She is righteous, and will not let anyone 
intimidate her. 
  Something else. I want to tell [Tomas Garcia] Fuste and that 
fat, bald, and blabber-mouth Angelito [Martin] guy, both of whom 
had Fidel dead and buried, that even if that were to happen and 
if our commander in chief was dead, we would be the first ones 
who would not let the likes of them set foot in Cuba. They are 
fascists, and so filled with hate that they will never be able 
to live side by side with the Cuban people. We seek love. We do 
not seek the hate that permeates them. They even say obscenities 
and insult people on the radio. They are a bunch of old bags 
that ought to keep quiet and yet they babble a lot. 
  The Cuban people have to support Magda Montiel, have to 
support her so as to let the Miami lot know that we support all 
those who came here seeking peace and love among Cubans. That 
ought to be stressed day in and day out, Cubans ought to call 
the radio so they can see that we are not the bad guys, they are. 
  [Cavada] Thank you very much. Next, I have several more 
calls 
to the answering machine. Good morning. 
  [Second unidentified speaker] "Good morning and thank you 
very much for this opportunity. Why does this Cuban lawyer there 
-- where human rights, liberty, and freedom of the press, 
speech, and movement are so touted -- not present a report to 
the Human Rights Commission explaining this problem? They say 
that here we violate every human right, yet: What are they doing 
right now? Do they not say that there is a lot of freedom, and 
that everything is free there. Well, they should also go before 
those dubious human rights commissions." 
  [Perez] "Good morning. My name is Ana Perez from Cerro 
Boulevard. I want to give my opinion regarding the interview 
with the journalist [as heard] who visited Cuba. I believe that 
those who are doing this in Miami are not even Cubans. I have 
relatives in Miami. And I believe that my relatives's dearest 
hope is to be able to come to Cuba and live together with us 
again. I do not believe these people are even Cubans, but 
two-bit politicians that want to live off politics and 
corruption. I have visited Miami and seen it on the television. 
I believe these people are not even Cubans nor love Cuba. They 
are shameless people. There is no need to be attacking anyone 
there, in addition to everything they do everyday. I think that 
what they are doing is abhorrent. Coming to Cuba is no crime."

  [Text] Havana, 29 Apr (EFE) -- Six Cubans who attempted to 
leave the island illegally in a boat were arrested today at El 
Malecon, the Havana avenue bordering the northern coast, in an 
area near the U.S. Interests Section, eyewitnesses have reported. 
  They are four men and two women who were spotted by a coast 
guard patrol several miles away. The coast guard patrol steered 
the rafters' flimsy boat to El Malecon, where they were met by 
police. A police car took the group of "rafters" away from the 
area, while approximately 50 bystanders and passersby witnessed 
the scene, according to the sources. The frustrated "rafters" 
attempted to reach the coast of Florida aboard a simple raft 
constructed from three tractor chambers, tied to pieces of wood 
with rope. 
  So far this year, 1,824 Cubans have reached the coast of 
Florida and of this number, 718 were picked up by the U.S. Coast 
Guard this month, according to the U.S. agency.

  [Text] At the First International Conference on the 
Sustainable Development of Small Insular States, which is being 
held in Barbados, a nongovernmental organization proposed that a 
declaration against the U.S. blockade on Cuba be included in the 
conference's final document. The proposal was made by (Peggy 
Antrobus), general coordinator of the Alternative for Women's 
Development, who recognized Cuba's strong emphasis on social 
development and the prioritization of investments in health 
care, education, and social security. 
  As part of that conference, on 4 June, a minisummit will be 
held to create the Association of Caribbean States, which will 
encompass not just English-speaking states but the entire 
Caribbean community, including Cuba. At that meeting, the heads 
of Caribbean states and governments will sign the constitution 
that will govern the association, whose goal is the 
establishment of a solid development program for the whole 
region. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas 
underscored the current and historical importance of Caribbean 
union: 
  [Begin Burelli recording] Once again the entire Caribbean 
community is united in a single body and in a single assembly. 
In the last 30 years, despite Cuba's historical and political 
weight, those abroad, specifically European countries, have 
viewed the Caribbean as exclusively English-speaking countries. 
Of course, those countries are very important; but the Caribbean 
includes much more than only those countries. The Caribbean has 
great importance historically, politically, and strategically. 
[end recording] 
  Foreign Minister Burelli added that the Association of 
Caribbean States will have goals identical to those of other 
international organizations, such as the Organization of 
American States. 
  [Begin Burelli recording] Except, in this case, the [words 
indistinct] is official. It will echo all aspects, languages, 
and interests of the Caribbean, which until now have always been 
divided. [end recording]

  [Text] With its customary warmth and hospitality, Santiago 
de Cuba welcomed Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who for 
nine hours visited this city accompanied by Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina. Escorted by Esteban Lazo, Politburo 
member and first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in 
Santiago de Cuba Province, President Chiluba and his delegation 
honored Jose Marti at the Santa Efigenia Cemetery. The 
delegation visited the Antonio Maceo Revolutionary Plaza, the 
Center for African Culture, and toured the museums of the 
Siboney farm [Granjita Siboney] and the former Moncada Barracks. 
  Frederick Chiluba also visited the Santiago Hotel, Cuba's 
first five-star hotel, and Santiago de Cuba's modern hospital 
which has capacity for more than 1,000 beds, which since its 
opening has treated 500,000 patients in 28 different specialties. 
  [Begin recording, in English with superimposed translations 
into Spanish] [Reporter] Mr. President, which have been the main 
topics of your conversations with the Cuban government? 
  [Chiluba] That we share a lot in common as members of the 
Nonaligned Movement and, of course, of the Third World. We face 
similar economic difficulties and therein lies the need for us 
to cooperate. Because of the very heavy social investments made 
in the fields of health and education, we have benefited 
tremendously. There are Cuban people working in our country who 
are helping to improve the living standard of our comrades 
there. So I think our coming here is intended further to 
strengthen the relations between the two countries. We consider 
it a matter of life or death that small nations need to 
cooperate and move together to be able to face a bigger world. 
We are happy to be here. 
  [Reporter] Thank you very much, Mr. President. [end 
recording] 
  At this moment, Frederick Chiluba and his official 
delegation 
are on their way back to Havana after having met with Zambian 
students who reside here in Santiago de Cuba.

  [Text] San Jose, 1 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican President 
Rafael Angel Calderon today emphasized his country's high 
economic growth rate, low inflation rate, and reduced poverty 
and described the Free Trade Agreement [TLC] with Mexico as one 
of the greatest achievements of his foreign policy. 
  In a report to the country entitled "Roads of Prosperity" 
read during a solemn session of the Legislative Assembly, the 
president said: "Our economic strategy allowed us to defeat 
inflation and the high cost of living." 
  To illustrate the apparent success of his administration, 
Calderon cited figures such as an increase in GNP from 6.5 
percent in 1992 to 7.7 percent in 1993 following a severe 
adjustment at the beginning of his government. 
  Calderon, who will turn over the presidency to Jose Maria 
Figueres of the Social Democratic Party next Sunday, said in 
this, his last report to the nation, that during his four-year 
term exports increased by 60 percent and reached $2.667 billion 
last year. He also said that the fiscal deficit, which stood at 
7.5 percent when he took office, was reduced to less than 1 
percent last year and inflation was reduced to 9 percent, the 
lowest in the past 15 years. 
  Calderon said that, contrary to what several sectors say 
about the country's alleged impoverishment, unemployment was 
reduced to 4 percent -- one of the lowest unemployment rates on 
the continent -- and poverty to less than 17 percent, three 
points less than when he assumed office. He also emphasized 
the growth of tourism, which is expected to become the primary 
source of foreign exchange this year, and housing programs, 
which led to the construction of 96,000 homes in four years. 
"The economic reform sponsored by this administration made it 
possible to release resources that were used in social programs. 
Thanks to this, Costa Rica remains an example of social and 
human development in Latin America," he said. 
  Regarding criticism for an alleged disregard of foreign 
policy, Calderon stressed "an active diplomacy" in favor of 
democracy and respect for human rights. In this connection, he 
recalled Costa Rica's participation in the crises in Haiti, 
Peru, and Guatemala. "Throughout these years, we contributed to 
the reaffirmation of processes for peace, democratization, and 
integration in Central America," he said, adding that the 
signing of the TLC between Costa Rica and Mexico is one of his 
administration's greatest achievements in the international 
field. 
  This commercial treaty, which will go into effect in January 
after it is ratified by the legislatures of the two countries, 
will permit the trade of 12,000 products. Costa Rica will be 
able to triple its exports to Mexico in the next two years. 
Such exports now reach barely $60 million, according to 
government and private enterprise calculations. 
  "Whatsoever a man soweth he shall also reap. Costa Rica has 
sown and is now reaping," the president said. Calderon will 
become part of the opposition on 8 May with one of the highest 
popularity levels a president has ever attained at the time of 
his departure from office. 
  During the early months of his government, Calderon 
implemented a severe economic adjustment program that led to 
higher public services rates, higher staple prices, a higher 
inflation rate, and low economic growth, a little over 2 
percent, in 1990. In this last report, however, he said: "We 
are enjoying the first fruits of a time of prosperity. We 
turned obstacles into solutions, obstructions into channels, and 
setbacks into victories. But we are just at the beginning of 
the road."

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The leftist coalition has proposed to 
President-elect Armando Calderon Sol of ARENA [Nationalist 
Republican Alliance] a six-point agenda that includes the need 
for a broad, concerted effort that will allow ARENA to govern 
the country and consolidate peace. 
  Former left-wing presidential candidate Dr. Ruben Zamora has 
said the opposition is willing to work with the ruling party to 
seek mechanisms that will lead to complete democracy. 
  The deployment of the PNC [National Civilian Police], the 
concurrent demobilization of the National Police, and the 
transference of lands are points in the peace agreement that are 
still pending and should be resolved through a broad, national, 
concerted effort, Ruben Zamora has said during an interview for 
the "Up-to-Date" newscast. The former coalition candidate has 
said it is essential for the Calderon Sol administration to seek 
a concerted effort. 
  [Begin Zamora recording] We are proposing a six-point agenda 
through which to achieve a concerted effort. I believe we must 
reach an agreement on the peace agreements or, rather, on the 
mechanisms to implement the peace agreements. [end recording] 
  The politician has said other points in the agenda presented 
to the ARENA president-elect, are: constitutional amendments to 
the judicial system; electoral reform; alternatives for 
environmental protection; consumer protection; and a social pact 
that will ensure governability. 
  [Begin Zamora recording] In order to succeed, the country 
needs a concerted effort, the most tangible proof of which is 
that the only way we could end the war was through a concerted 
effort. [end recording] 
  Zamora has said the parties in the coalition will develop an 
opposition that will seek a concerted effort based on three 
points. 
  [Begin Zamora recording] Supervision first; proposals and 
alternatives second; and a concerted effort fourth. This will 
be difficult, because these three roles are not homogeneous and 
can even be contradictory, but it must be done. [end recording] 
  The former presidential candidate has said that as of this 
week all the political parties will begin their postelection 
reorganizations. According to Zamora, power struggles will 
develop within ARENA as well as in the left-wing parties, 
although he expressed assurance it is not a matter of engaging 
in political cannibalism.

  [Text] San Salvador, 1 May (ACAN-EFE) -- El Salvador's 
Legislative Assembly, elected last 20 March and in which the 
former guerrillas are represented as the second largest 
political force, opened its session with a solemn ceremony today. 
  The first point on the agenda was the appointment of the 
Debate Commission--which later presided over the first plenary 
session--headed by Deputy Walter Rene Araujo, of the 
progovernment Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA, rightist). 
  Former guerrilla Commander Ana Guadalupe Martinez, of the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), and labor 
leader Rosa Melida Villatoro, a deputy of the Christian 
Democratic Party (PDC), were appointed commission secretaries. 
  Ana Guadalupe Martinez, who with 20 other FMLN 
representatives form the second largest legislative force, read 
the roster of 84 deputies who make up the parliament. 
  Following this ceremony, Walter Araujo announced a one-hour 
recess so that the Debate Commission can receive the credentials 
of deputies and vote later to elect the board of directors.

  [Text] San Salvador, 1 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Gloria Salguero 
Gross, a deputy for the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance 
(ultra right-wing ARENA) was elected by a split vote the new 
president of El Salvador's Legislative Assembly today, Sunday. 
  Salguero received the support of 70 of the 84 deputies that 
make up the assembly, including seven members of the former 
guerrilla Farabundo Marti National Liberation Movement (FMLN). 
The remaining 14 FMLN deputies abstained. 
  The presidential election took place during installation of 
the Legislative Assembly ceremonies. The process was marked by 
chants, jeers, and shouting by FMLN militants, who were 
protesting because the previous legislature changed the 
institution's bylaws, allowing the new president to vote twice.

<F P=106> [Report by Hilda Quijano from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Legislative Assembly has approved the Armed 
Forces Administrative Law that establishes the constitutional 
mandate the Armed Forces must fulfill under the country's new 
conditions. The legislative decree, which contains nearly 100 
articles, outlines the Army's new doctrine. The Administrative 
Law establishes a framework from which the Army must not waver. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The most basic aspect 
of this law, although this is not new in terms of our 
constitutional legislation, is the clear and absolute separation 
of the security corps from the control of the Armed Forces, 
which I believe is good for the country. Another important 
aspect of the doctrine is that the Armed Forces will serve the 
people and, in turn, will become a guarantor of human rights. 
The Armed Forces must think of civilians not as their enemies 
but as the focal point of their duty. [end recording] 
  The Constitution mandates that the Armed Forces defend 
national sovereignty and territorial integrity, thereby taking 
away their responsibility for public security. Some deputies 
say this mandate has always been the same, but there were times 
when it was not followed. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The Army has always 
had specific functions; however, what has happened is that the 
Army has been used for actions that are not part of its 
constitutional duties. [end recording] 
  The Armed Forces Administrative Law creates the post of 
inspector general, who will be a member of the military and will 
check into the behavior of Army members. The inspector general 
is answerable to the defense minister. The decree also places 
all of the Army's work and administrative organization under a 
constitutional mandate in accordance with the peace agreements.

  [Text] Santa Ana coffee growers and professionals are 
urging the Armed Forces to conduct an operation against gangs of 
kidnappers and thieves that operate in that region, some of 
which include mercenaries. 
  Families of the victims and farmers, who have paid large 
sums 
of money for their release, continue to receive threats and 
letters in which they are warned "their days are numbered." 
Some of those who were threatened showed EL DIARIO DE HOY a 
letter signed by a certain "Commander Oscar," the self-styled 
leader of the "New People's National Liberation Army." In the 
letter "Commander Oscar" announces that starting next Monday a 
new war will be waged against the coffee growers and landowners, 
who will also have to pay a war tax of 2,000 colones per month. 
Likewise, the criminals say they have a list of 400 persons who 
will be kidnapped and warn people to be prepared. 
  The same sources report that gangs of former rebels who use 
military weapons -- such as M-16 and AK-47 rifles, as well as 
other weapons that were in vogue during the war -- operate in 
the region. Because of this they doubt the police can do much to 
stop them for two reasons: First, because the PNC [National 
Civilian Police] does not have adequate equipment, and second, 
because a large part of the police is made up of former FMLN 
members. 
  They claim the gangs operate from the base of Santa Ana 
volcano and that some are led by foreign mercenaries, because 
black men and men with European traits have been spotted. A 
column of men was seen near Lake Coatepeque a few days ago. 
Former captives of these gangs say these men use olive-green 
camouflage uniforms and tennis shoes. Also, they communicate by 
radio with other gangs that operate in Cerro de Guazapa (San 
Salvador), Los Naranjos (Sonsonate-Santa Ana), and San Miguel 
volcano. They also claim the gangs have their own camps at the 
entrance of Santa Ana volcano, in El Milagro ranch, and in other 
places that are already known to the authorities. 
  One of those threatened sent the note from the presumed 
"Commander Oscar" to Defense Minister General Humberto Corado. 
He says he received a reply that the "peace accords" have 
limited the role of the Armed Forces. As to the Army's 
patrolling of the roads, the coffee growers say these steps are 
not sufficient because the soldiers will not enter the coffee 
plantations as they have been prohibited from doing so. 
  Among those kidnapped are Ricardo Planas, whose family paid 
500,000 colones as ransom,; Mauricio Lopez Parker, 25,000; 
Carmen Martinez, 30,000; Guillermo Martinez H., 30,000; Lola 
Giammattei, 150,000; Ernesto Escobar Pacas, 125,000 colones, 
among others. "Santa Ana is an inferno, because gangs of thieves 
and kidnappers operate with complete impunity," they said in an 
alarmed manner. A few days ago some distinguished ladies were 
leaving the Santa Lucia Church, following a mass for Dona Alicia 
Valiente de Hernandez, mother of Dr. Rene Hernandez Valiente, 
and all were robbed of their belongings. Because of this, they 
are asking President Alfredo Cristiani to authorize the Army to 
conduct an operation to rid the zone of criminals because many 
of the farms have been abandoned by their owners and overseers. 
  When General Corado was asked about this, he said the 
institution is ready to obey any order issued by the commander 
in chief of the Armed Forces, that is, by President Cristiani.

  [Text] During a visit to Peten Department on Tuesday, 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio referred to the challenge raised 
by Deputy Carlos Arroyave Cerna against the elections for new 
deputies. De Leon also spoke about the provisional 
constitutional protection decree issued by the Supreme Court of 
Justice in the face of this challenge. 
  [Begin de Leon recording] The political aspect has been 
resolved. The executive branch no longer has anything to do 
with the elections taking place. This is now the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal's problem. 
  Challenges of this nature are common under a legal regime. 
The appropriate constitutional organizations, in this case the 
highest constitutional justice organization, will decide the 
constitutionality of the elections. The executive branch no 
longer has anything to do with that. 
  I say this because once these phases are over and we have 
institutional and political stability and because we have seen 
positive results in these areas, we have to dedicate ourselves 
more fervently to resolving economic and social problems. [end

  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has commented on the 
ruling on the electoral process issued by the Constitutionality 
Court [CC] and on the implications of this ruling for the 
current political situation: 
  [Begin De Leon recording] As for the resolution issued by 
the honorable CC, I said from the very beginning when the amparo 
was filed, that I would respect the independence of the state 
branches. The role of the Executive Branch is over. In a state 
of law in a legal regime, it is absolutely normal for a person, 
institution, or group to adopt the corresponding legal actions 
should he or it disagree with an action, resolution, or law. 
That is how any citizen, such as this deputy, files a recourse. 
  At that time I said that I would respect the ruling issued 
by 
the CC, the top constitutional justice tribunal. That is just 
what I did. At that time I also said -- and this can be 
confirmed today -- that Guatemalans have great trust in one of 
the most credible institutions in Guatemala, the CC. They also 
trust the integrity, and above all, the 
juridical-political-electoral capabilities of the honorable 
magistrates who make up the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Given 
the experience and knowledge of this organization, the 
population was sure that the call for elections was based on 
legal grounds. [end recording]

  [Text] At yesterday's regular session, following a lengthy 
review, the Constitutionality Court [CC] repealed the 
provisional amparo filed by Deputy Carlos Humberto Arroyave 
Cerna against the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE]. In making 
its decision, the CC overturned a lower court's decision to 
temporarily suspend TSE Decree 2-94 of 11 April, which scheduled 
nationwide district elections for congressional deputies on 14 
August. 
  In reviewing the events, the CC contended that the 
circumstances in this case neither warranted the granting of the 
amparo writ nor the issuance of such a writ ex-officio, as 
supported in Article 28 of the law on this matter. Therefore, a 
repeal of the controversial resolution was in order. Both sides 
were immediately informed of this decision, according to CC 
Secretary Manuel Garcia. 
  In turn, the CC added, the TSE may continue preparing for 
the 
elections as originally scheduled. 
  Regarding an appeal filed by Deputy Arroyave Cerna, the CC 
confirmed it must continue to go through the relevant appeals 
process without posing any obstacle to the electoral process.

<F P=106> [By Jose Luis Castillejos] </F>
  [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Defense Minister 
General Mario Rene Enriquez said today that the Guatemalan Army 
is prepared to greet peace, to redefine its role in society, to 
become smaller, and, at a given moment, to obey the rulings of a 
truth commission. 
  The self-styled "general for peace" said that the Army "has 
opened the doors to pacification" in this country where an armed 
conflict has created hatred and violence. During a meeting with 
the Foreign Press Club, Enriquez reported that the 47,000-strong 
Army has begun to draft new objectives for itself in order to 
adjust to the national situation that will emerge once the armed 
struggle initiated 33 years ago concludes. Enriquez explained 
that the military reorganization process is considering 
disarming 17,000 members of the 400,000-strong paramilitary 
Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC] as well as redefining the 
Guatemalan State defense policy. 
  He added: "Once a peace agreement is signed, the Armed 
Forces 
could be dedicated to defending the 3,000 archaeological sites 
that international bands of jewel-traffickers loot, protecting 
the borders, and preventing the indiscriminate felling of trees 
in Peten (in northern Guatemala), one of the areas considered to 
be a world lung. 
  Regarding troop reduction, Enriquez said that the Guatemalan 
Army is small and should be increased to 100,000. However, he 
said that if the peace agreements call for a reduction, the 
institution will obey. The general said that "quality can 
substitute for quantity," which means making the Army, which has 
been accused of violating human rights, more professional. 
Right now, the Guatemalan military favors Refashioning the 
Military [Reconversion Military], which means tasking the Army 
with functions that up to now have been carried out by other 
institutions. These functions include natural disaster 
assistance, the eradication of drugs, and environmental 
protection. Guatemala is the only country in Central America in 
which a war is under way, and for this reason, according to 
Enriquez, the Army justifiably maintains its role as defender of 
the state and nationality in the face of an enemy inspired by a 
foreign ideology. 
  The government and the rebel Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity are continuing a peace negotiation process, 
and it is expected that by August the discussions will be 
centered on the guerrilla demand for the "demilitarization" of 
the country. This means not only the reduction of the military 
force but also the elimination of its influence in society. 
  The defense minister, one of the 11 Army generals on active 
duty and who has worked for the institution for 29 years, 
expressed his satisfaction with the way the peace negotiations 
with the guerrillas are progressing. He said he is pleased with 
the presence in the country of a UN Preliminary Mission. This 
mission is determining what technical and financial requirements 
must be met to establish an international verification program 
in Guatemala. Referring to the establishment of a truth 
commission similar to the one that operated in El Salvador, 
Enriquez said it would be "biased and would try to weaken the 
Army's morale." 
  The military commander said that the military institution 
would accept resolutions on human rights violations only if the 
government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio accepts a 
commission of this nature. He regretted that the guerrillas 
"will not share responsibilities for assassinations, 
kidnappings, war taxes, and other illegal actions against the 
interests of the nation." 
  Enriquez said: "The president will decide whether or not 
such 
a commission is created. We do not want biased recommendations, 
though." Enriquez accused the guerrillas of violating the 
Global Human Rights Agreement signed on 29 March. According to 
Enriquez, the guerrillas carried out illegal actions in the 
combat zone of Ixcan, in the northwestern Department of Quiche, 
a zone known also as the "heart" of the Poor People's Guerrilla 
Army. 
  Enriquez charged that some nongovernmental organizations are 
still giving economic assistance to the guerrillas for the 
purchasing of weapons. He noted that the current Guatemalan 
Administration is trying to secure evidence that these 
organizations are helping the rebels as well as trying to 
prevent them from entering the country.

<F P=106> [Letters by Defense Minister General Reynaldo Andino Flores </F>
to the National Congress on 27 April and "text" of proposed 
draft ammendment to Article 276 of the Constitution on military 
service] 
  [Text] Secretaries of the National Congress: On 
instructions from the president of the Republic and Armed Forces 
commander in chief and in compliance with Article 213 of the 
Constitution, I hereby send to you a draft decree and 
corresponding explanation of motives regarding the amendment to 
Article 276 of the Constitution. 
  [Signed] Brigadier General Reynaldo Andino Flores, defense 
minister. 
<H5>  Explanation of Motives </H5>
  The proposal that has been presented is based on the need to 
replace conscription with enlistment for educational, social, 
humanitarian, and democratic purposes. This enlistment should 
spark and stimulate the interest of Honduran youths in 
developing their human potential and engaging in military 
training to defend the homeland. 
  Once the constitutional amendment is ratified and enacted, 
enlistment for educational purposes should be developed into a 
secondary law to regulate its organization and operation. 
  With the proposed constitutional amendment, the president of 
the Republic makes good a pledge made to the Honduran people 
that he would substantially change military service. 
  I have no doubts that the proposal to amend Article 276 of 
the Constitution, whose essential basis and justification we 
have presented, will be approved by the National Congress with 
the majority required by our Constitution. 
  [Signed] Brigadier General Reynaldo Andino Flores, defense 
minister. 
  This is the text of the proposed amendment. 
<H5>  Decree No. </H5>
  Whereas the Honduran people's duty to defend and serve the 
homeland -- a duty set forth by Article 38 of the Constitution 
-- can be complied with through military service or any of the 
various civil services that citizens must render according to 
their merits and capabilities, as demanded by the country's 
fundamental needs; 
  Whereas Honduran society's evolution demands a revision of 
the criteria with which military service has traditionally been 
complied with, and this compliance should be regarded by the 
people, particularly young people, as compliance with a civic 
duty rather than a mere demand; 
  Whereas the Honduran people should be given the option for 
military service that would make it possible to reconcile the 
will to render it with the duty to serve and defend the homeland 
anywhere and under any circumstances demanded by the homeland, 
and the need to give the people this option cannot be delayed 
any longer; and Whereas the state must ensure the fulfillment 
of the constitutional duties assigned to the Armed Forces, and 
it is thus necessary for the Armed Forces to have a permanent 
number of compulsary members, according to the Constitution, it 
is therefore decreed: Article 1. Article 276 of the 
Constitution shall be amended to read as follows: "Article 276: 
Citizens between 18 and 30 years of age will serve in the Armed 
Forces on a voluntary basis in peacetime for educational, 
social, humanitarian, and democratic purposes. The state, 
however, retains the right to exercise conscription according to 
the Military Service Law. In case of international war, all 
Hondurans capable of defending and serving the homeland are 
soldiers." 
  Article 2. For this decree to become law, it shall be 
ratified by the National Congress in the next regular 
legislature by two thirds of the total number of members and 
published in the gazette. 
  Tegucigalpa, on such and such day of 1994. 
  [Signed] The president and secretaries.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 27 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Military sources 
announced today that the Honduran Armed Forces will deactivate 
four battalions in June, as part of the government's military 
reduction program. Each of the deactivated military units has 
approximately 800 soldiers, according to the sources quoted by 
the private television "Today" newscast. The newscast did not 
disclose the source. 
  Sources close to the presidential palace said that the 
Honduran Armed Forces will be reduced from 24,000 to 12,000 
troops, an amount similar to Nicaragua's Armed Forces. 
Reduction of the Honduran military will follow once the 
demilitarization in Nicaragua and El Salvador is completed, in 
accordance with these neighboring countries' peace agreements. 
  General Luis Alonso Discus Elvir, commander in chief of the 
Armed Forces, said recently that the Honduran Army will reduce 
operating costs by 10 percent.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Carlos Roberto Reina with </F>
unidentified reporters and Honduran citizens at the Telesistema 
Hondureno television studios in Tegucigalpa -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Reina, in progress] ... I feel like someone who 
has returned to his alma mater after graduation to see the 
friendly faces and hear the voices that helped him through every 
step of the struggle. I am very honored. I am a friend who has 
come to speak with the Honduran people. 
  [Reporter] Thank you very much, Mr. President. Friends, you 
can now ask your questions and viewers can participate by 
calling us at 32-6074 and 32-5514. Mr. President, it is obvious 
that the topic of the moment, the issue that is being discussed 
by all Hondurans and even internationally, because it 
constitutes a big step for Honduras, is the change from 
obligatory military service to a voluntary and educational 
military service. We discussed it on this program last night 
with great satisfaction. What does this mean to you? At first 
glance it looks like the beginning of the fulfillment of 
campaign promises. 
  [Reina] I am truly very pleased to have accomplished what I 
proposed during the campaign through a concerted effort and in a 
very serious, united way. We have not had any conflicts. There 
are, of course, some considerations that must be taken into 
account, although certain sectors refuse to do so. For example, 
what would happen if the voluntary military service fails to 
provide the number of Armed Forces troops required at any given 
time? I believe that issue has been properly addressed. 
Citizens have certain duties, and the state, during times of 
war and in accordance with the law, can find ways to draft those 
citizens whose duty it is to serve. But we cannot do it the way 
we used to recruit people. We all agreed on that point. No 
one agreed with our previous recruitment system because it had 
two defects: first, it was very rigid; and second, only the poor 
were drafted while the sons of the wealthy evaded the draft. 
That could not be viewed as justice anywhere in the world. 
That is why this step has been received with great 
satisfaction, and, of course, I am very proud. 
  I congratulate the Armed Forces, the Honduran people, and 
the 
young people whose wishes I have fulfilled with this decision 
that began as a campaign promise and is today a reality in the 
National Congress. 
  [Reporter] Why use adjectives such as social and humanism, 
Mr. President? 
  [Reina] To be absolutely frank, those adjectives were 
suggested by distinguished officers as a means of complementing 
and enriching the document. The word social is used because the 
trend is to help the majority; and the word humanism is used 
because humanism is the prevalent doctrine at the end of this 
century. For instance, when we talk about fighting drugs and 
corruption and of making our measures humane, that constitutes 
humanism and meshes perfectly with the idea that our men, 
respecting our dignity, will defend their fatherland without the 
harshness that once marked recruitment. This position is 
humanistic, social, and educational because it will enable each 
recruit to improve his cultural heritage and because it is 
voluntary. 
  [Reporter] What do you mean, Mr. President, when you say 
that military service will also be democratic? 
  [Reina] I mean that democracy is not simply a matter of 
going 
to the polls. It is not a formality. It is a philosophy to 
live by. Every decision must be made with the objective of 
shaping a democratic man. A democratic man does not take 
advantage of anyone; he does not offend or violate rights. A 
democratic man accepts opposing decisions by those involved in a 
dialogue. He would never take arbitrary actions. Democracy as 
a way of life is perhaps the most important meaning of this work. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, today we heard different reactions 
to your decision from various, obviously important sectors. 
The most important reaction probably came from Defense 
Minister General Andino Flores. He virtually said that the 
Armed Forces had accepted the decision of their commander in 
chief, who is the president of the Republic. He implied very 
clearly, however, that the Armed Forces high command had not 
fully accepted the decision. He said that they acknowledge that 
the commander in chief, who is the president of the Republic, 
has the final world, but that they disagreed with the decision 
nevertheless. 
  [Reina] I believe his terminology is causing some confusion. 
The Armed Forces said: We will accept the decision. We are 
nondeliberative. We are obedient, and this is the final 
decision. The defense minister himself will present the draft 
and explain the reasons for it. Gen. Andino Flores tried to 
explain -- this is my interpretation -- that the high command 
does not exactly share my views on voluntary service because 
obligatory service allowed the Army to have the number of troops 
the country would need at any given time. I wanted to stay 
between these two extremes. The Armed Forces say: We disagree 
but we obey. I do not see any contradiction. This confirms 
that the idea of a voluntary military service comes not from 
them but from the president of the Republic. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, can you tell the Honduran people 
that an agreement on this issue has been reached with the Armed 
Forces High Command? 
  [Reina] Discussions were very open, very cordial. There were 
positions that from the beginning did not agree, but in the 
final draft we began to find this point of consensus. I believe 
this has been one of the quickest moves toward consensus. It is 
a truly historic act -- really momentous. It is a change, and 
changes of course deserve to be discussed. The parties should 
accept the resolution made by consensus. 
  [Reporter] It was indeed an historic event. As you said 
tonight, there was a consensus. Today there was a meeting 
between a ranking officer and the National Party. What was the 
meaning of that meeting? Do you think it was necessary? 
  [Reina] I think it was a political act. The issue is now at 
the National Assembly, the political forum par excellence where 
every option will be discussed. Some will insist that the draft 
must be obligatory. I have heard someone say that this 
contradicts citizens' rights. Nevertheless, I think the most 
important thing is to please the majority, which will be very 
satisfied with this great step forward. No more will we see 
young men virtually lassoed and forcefully drafted. I have 
always insisted on this. A heroic figure showed us how to win 
battles. Battles are won only by men who voluntarily defend 
their rights. 
  [Reporter] Very interesting, Mr. President. You speak of 
winning battles. Let us talk about the country's economic 
situation. You spoke of giving the economy a human face, but 
the prices of many basic basket products have been raised. That 
is what the people resent most, particularly considering that 
you have been in office less than 100 days. What do you think 
about this? 
  [Reina] Those price increases do not depend on the 
government. There is a mistake regarding the human face 
reference. At the Jose Cecilio del Valle building today we 
explained the nature of the Honduran Social Investment Fund 
[FHIS], which will reach every corner of the country, not as a 
social compensation, as it has been described, but as projects 
for a majority of the people. The idea is not to give things 
away to people but to help them intelligently and spontaneously 
develop their own communities. Now we will talk about boards of 
trustees, which have never really worked very well. The 
community and the government should participate in projects to 
benefit the people. Through a broad plan, FHIS will provide the 
human face we want for the government measures. We intend to 
reach all communities. If someone protests because beets or 
carrots are more expensive, he should remember that these prices 
do not depend on the government. The government could freeze 
prices, but that would be a risky move because there could be 
negative effects. The Honduran economy will improve when we 
produce more. We are laying the groundwork for higher 
production and for the people's health through food so basic 
grains are not absent from Hondurans' tables next year. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, your remarks about production are 
for the intermediate and long term. What about a short-term 
solution for the basic product price raises? 
  [Reina] We could even freeze prices. I have selected an 
economic cabinet made up of the most capable Hondurans. We have 
no commitments to anyone. There are several important projects 
such as the Trujillo Bay and the cold storages, but we have no 
obligations. We are approaching these projects with free hands. 
A decision will be made about what is best for the nation. 
Prices remain as they are because we are in a very difficult 
situation. 
  [Reina] The economic situation I inherited, as well as the 
nation's overall situation, has been truly dramatic. We will 
not be looking to the past. We want to look toward the future. 
When there is talk that we have not yet taken off, I want to say 
that the government has implemented a number of measures, 
including the historic measure on volunteer military service. 
Nevertheless, what we have not been able to do away with is the 
corruption that prevails in this country. We are committed to 
doing this. We will eliminate and overcome corruption. 
  [Reporter] Peasant organizations that want to become 
productive are concerned about the fact that there has been an 
announcement saying credits are now available, but so far, these 
credits have not been issued to enable the peasants to work 
their fields. We also have reported that 10-15 days a [words 
indistinct] to the president of the Republic and the government 
for those credits to be released under very favorable conditions. 
  [Reina] We are committed to this, and we believe we will 
fulfill this promise. I met with the peasant associations. 
They requested that land titles be granted in a more 
expeditious manner. We have issued pertinent orders for land 
titles to be delivered as quickly as possible. A large number 
of peasants will be issued documents that will given them full 
protection of their property. This is one of my campaign 
promises -- namely, legal security for all Hondurans. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, on the issue of corruption, we 
have 
heard of corruption charges against high-ranking members of your 
government -- for example, in the transportation administration, 
the transportation ministry -- that is, SECOPT [Secretariat of 
Communications, Public Works, and Transportation] -- as well as 
in INJUPEM [Teachers Retirement and Pension Institute] and PANI 
[National Children's Board]. It appears that these accusations 
have enough credence to at least look for people who are 
responsible. Do you believe such people should be brought to 
trial? 
  [Reina] If they are not put on trial, we will have achieved 
nothing. The judicial branch was created to prosecute all 
criminal activities and to punish the guilty. On 10 May, I will 
hold a general meeting to analyze the way in which we have been 
advancing and uncovering illicit actions. The Commission to 
Prevent and Fight Corruption [Commission de Prevencion y Combate 
a la Corrupcion] will announce the specific cases -- of which 
there are many. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Humberto Garcia asks if one of the attractions 
of voluntary educational service is that a person will receive 
the minimum wage when he enters military service? 
  [Reina] This has been one of the arguments used by men in 
uniform that has some validity; however, I have spoken to 
businessmen, economists, and labor experts, and this need not be 
the exact case. A minimum-wage increase would not solve the 
problem. The country will go bankrupt if we give a soldier who 
now earns 50 lempiras the minimum wage. 
  We are going to try to improve conditions so that the 
people's cultural level can start to improve through education. 
The country will benefit from this improvement and the 
professionalism that it will bring to the Armed Forces. There 
is something very interesting. The Air Force and Navy do not 
have compulsory recruitment. The young people even wait in line 
to enter those services. Thus, we have taken measures to make 
the other services attractive too. 
  [Reporter] You mentioned wages and improving the situation, 
Mr. President. Does this mean the Armed Forces budget will be 
increased? 
  [Reina] It could come to that. However, what has been 
ordered for the time being is a reduction in the size of the 
government. The Armed Forces accepted this with great dignity, 
and it promptly cut 10 percent from its budget. 
  [Reporter] What changes will this important event, which 
requires a constitutional reform and also concerns the Armed 
Forces, demand in the relations between the Armed Forces and 
civilian society? 
  [Reina] It demands the total unification of Hondurans. It 
requires that everyone, civilians, religious people, laymen, 
atheists, and military personnel unite. It requires that 
everyone who lives in this country feel that, at the end of this 
century, the country has established a climate of security, 
peace, development, and harmony. We have to unify the Honduran 
nation. The Cold War -- we talked about the Cold War during our 
campaign -- divided and harmed us a great deal. I hope we will 
never return to such a situation. 
  [Reporter] On the issue of corruption, Mr. President. Based 
on the charges made by the current government and the U.S. 
Senate pronouncements on corruption in Honduras, what is your 
opinion of the government organizations that are in charge of 
controlling this problem? 
  [Reina] They have to be assessed. We will now have a 
prosecutor general who is going to be the nerve center of the 
entire, let us call it, government probity system. This, 
together with the general state modernization concept, is part 
of the new term. The modernization of the state will allow us 
to make a thorough assessment of the kind of government we have 
had. I said to you during my campaign: We want a state as 
close to normal as possible. The three elements of the state 
are territory, population, and government. Our territory has 
not been defined. We still have to define its coastal area. 
The population did not identify with the country, and the 
governments were not elected. Thus, we were a state that was far 
from being perfect. Today, we are starting to improve the 
government. We are going to evaluate all the electoral issues. 
We are going to review the way people are registered. We have 
advanced in this respect because now we all feel we need to 
improve the government's mechanisms. 
  [Reporter] The Honduran people are plagued by high 
electricity rates and an energy crisis. When will Hondurans 
stop seeing their bills grow by the month? When will they see 
an end to electricity cuts? 
  [Reina] The crisis involves more than just the rates because 
if we continue to have blackouts, the country could go 
completely bankrupt. That is the problem we are trying to solve 
first. Yesterday I received a very attentive, fraternal, and 
timely call from the Mexican president. He will give 
us....[pauses] He said this because on Sunday, engineers will 
leave Honduras to check the units he will give us. Each one has 
a 30-megawatt capacity. Those 60 megawatts will ease the 
situation considerably. This, along with an electricity 
interconnection with Panama and a possible interconnection with 
Costa Rica and Nicaragua, will help us overcome the crisis. 
  The truth is that there are many shortcomings. First, all 
those who have robbed the ENEE [National Enterprise for Electric 
Power] [words indistinct] robbing water or energy. Second, 
rates have not been at the level the enterprise should have set. 
To give you an example, it is not right that someone who owns a 
hut in a shantytown pays the same rate as someone who lives in a 
luxury residential area. 
  Part of the solution could lie in that difference in the 
possibility to contribute energy for everyone. [sentence as 
heard] I think we will work toward ensuring that the ENEE 
overcomes its crisis once and for all. Surprisingly, 190 
million lempiras is owed to the ENEE. 
  [Reporter] We have a list of many companies, including 
multinationals, that owe the ENEE. We do not understand why 
this was allowed to happen. We learned, through complaints made 
through the media, that people protest when electricity is cut 
when they owe 70 or 90 lempiras. 
  [Reina] That is one of the irregularities. Callejas told me 
once: The situation at ENEE needs to be reviewed because it is 
the most poorly managed company in this country. I think there 
have been all sorts of problems there. There are people who act 
dishonestly by stealing energy but they are actually stealing 
from the people. We must stop this. This type of corruption 
must be eliminated not partially but at the very root. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, what responsibility do the 
engineers, boards of directors, and ENEE management during the 
previous administration bear for this new rationing? 
  [Reina] That is where the commissions that were appointed to 
uncover corruption, tax evasion, embezzlement, and inefficiency 
come in. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Reina] They could be held responsible if the negligence was 
very serious and punishable. 
  [Reporter] What will your government do to collect the huge 
debt that companies and private citizens owe the ENEE? 
  [Reina] As I told you during my campaign: Enforce the law. 
The law is not enforced here. 
  [Reporter] When will you begin to enforce the [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Reina] I think that it is already being enforced and there 
are already (?fugitives). Efforts are already under way to 
obtain pardons for these poor people. They say that the people 
should only be made to pay their debts. The issue here is not 
whether the person should pay, because anyone who commits a 
crime must pay for it. That is what people will find the most 
exciting and what will convince them of the new style of 
government that I have spoken about. 
  [Reporter] Will you tell us about that in your next message? 
  [Reina] My next message will be full of information. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, more specifically, will 
electricity 
rates be raised? 
  [Reina] The decision belongs to the commission. We declared 
the emergency. We found the most capable people to handle the 
problem. It is up to them. 
  [Reporter] International credit organizations have suggested 
that your government raise tolls and eliminate transportation 
subsidies. 
  [Reina] [Words indistinct] I have always believed that tolls 
on alternate routes are a burdensome tax. Every driver has two 
alternatives: use a paved street or a gravel one. Either way, 
your vehicle is subject to a toll. That is how it is 
everywhere. Curiously, Hondurans will gladly pay tolls 
everywhere else and consider it normal, but they resist paying 
the tax at home. There are some exceptions, such as the 
distinguished city of San Pedro Sula, where everyone pays tolls 
willingly. I think that is why we should implement the measure 
gradually in the rest of the country. 
  The problem is how to balance our budget and correct the 
deficit, how to overcome our concerns. Everyone trembles when 
representatives of international banks come to the country to 
collect, and we have a knife at our throats. One possible 
solution would be to privatize Hondutel [Honduran 
Telecommunications Enterprise]. Such transactions, if they are 
not handled carefully, could turn out to be just another tragedy 
for the country. I will discuss all of these subjects later, 
such as the plans for an oil refinery in Puerto Castilla and a 
cold-storage enterprise. All of these plans, considered by an 
impartial arbiter such as the government, can give the country 
incentive and improve its image. We have received assistance 
from Mexico and Costa Rica because they have seen our country's 
democratic process and the strengthening of our institutions. 
  [Reporter] Who authorized the refinery planned for Puerto 
Castilla? 
  [Reina] It has not been authorized. 
  [Reporter] No, it hasn't. Who made the deal? 
  [Reina] The previous government. 
  [Reporter] What is being done? 
  [Reina] A commission has been appointed to check everything 
and to consult ecologists and businessmen so the best possible 
decision will be made for the Honduran people. Just like that. 
Great things are simple. Hidden things are a cancer, as I have 
mentioned several times. 
  [Reporter] Who will decide which firm will conduct the 
environmental study and determine the pro's and con's of 
installing a refinery in Puerto Castilla? 
  [Reina] We have to find the most capable firm. 
  [Reporter] Who will make the decision? 
  [Reina] The government. We have a very radical environment 
minister, and we have those with interests in the refinery who 
keep extolling its virtues. Both positions must be considered 
and a decision made. 
  [Reporter] Personally speaking, do you have reservations 
about the refinery? 
  [Reina] I think the ecologists might be right. If so, we 
would have to look for another location for the refinery. I am 
not sure about this because I am no expert. Many good things 
are mentioned in connection with this refinery, but no one would 
dare propose to make a deal with me for these things. I do not 
think anyone would dare make such a proposal during my term. 
  [Reporter] What you say is very important. 
  [Reina] Very important. 
  [Reporter] Are you planning to privatize Hondutel? 
  [Reina] We will open the debate. We will privatize it if 
necessary; otherwise, things will remain as they are. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Reporter] What about your invitation from the U.S. 
President to attend the summit meeting in Miami in December? 
  [Reina] It is a dignified invitation from the President of 
the United States. 
  There are two big events coming up: one in Cartagena among 
the Latin American [as heard] heads of state, and the other in 
early December in Miami. We have been invited to the latter by 
President Clinton. 
  I think these two events must become complementary. [Words 
indistinct] with President Gaviria and with President Figueres 
to begin establishing agendas for the two summits. Otherwise 
they could be repetitious. The two agendas could be topical. 
One could focus on the inter-American system, human rights, and 
drug trafficking, while the other could emphasize social 
development, national identity, and all forms of corruption that 
impede the development of democracy. That way we would make 
these two big summits complementary. They are important because 
they will be held at a time when the world is very much in favor 
of everything that contributes to unity. 
  [Reporter] I wonder how this attitude can help Honduras? How 
could [words indistinct] benefit Honduras? 
  [Reina] In the first place, the country that isolates itself 
is a country that fails and gets trapped in its own problems. 
Honduras has been one of the most isolated countries in the 
region. Hondurans have not been good negotiators. We have to 
change this attitude. I am surprised that within such a short 
period -- I only have three months in government, for example -- 
relations with Costa Rica are excellent. Costa Rica is not very 
inclined to integrate with Central America and has instead tried 
to join South America and even Europe. Now, with President 
Figueres we have very similar positions. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Why haven't subsidies been taken away from the 
transportation sector and given to farmers to produce more food? 
  [Reina] If subsidies are taken away from bus owners, they 
will increase fares, and we will see buses being set on fire in 
the streets. It is not so easy to govern. Regarding food, the 
natural resources minister has drafted a plan that I hope will 
work. There will be enough basic grains for this year. 
  [Reporter] What do you think about the warnings that some 
assembly companies are thinking about leaving the country 
because of problems with electricity rationing and the creation 
of labor unions? 
  [Reina] Those companies could resolve the energy problem by 
[words indistinct]. I am sure their business can afford this 
and still profit. 
  Regarding the labor union problem, these laws cannot be 
modified by any particular person. Laws cannot be superseded by 
contracts or agreements. Laws represent the interest of the 
state and are not negotiable on orders from anyone. 
  If assembly companies want to take advantage of our low-wage 
labor force and our geopolitical location close to the great 
U.S. market -- because they know that it is profitable -- they 
must also help us improve the kind of assembly being done here 
by transferring technology through industrial contracts. I 
think this will come. It is just a matter of being patient. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] What about commercial and diplomatic relations 
with Cuba? 
  [Reina] I think this is one of the delicate issues that must 
be discussed at the summit meetings: the Cartagena one, in which 
Spain and Portugal will participate since it is the 
Ibero-American Summit; and the Miami meeting, which President 
Clinton has convoked. 
  I think the system must find a democratic way out. An 
abnormal situation must not continue indefinitely. I do believe 
that whoever replaces President Fidel Castro must live in Cuba 
and be a charismatic leader inside Cuba. We must seek a 
democratic and peaceful transition. 
  [Reporter] You would not establish formal relations with 
Cuba 
under Fidel Castro? 
  [Reina] I will abide by whatever the inter-American system 
decides on this. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Mario Reina, economic and legal adviser at </F>
the Honduran Presidency, by Lourdes Bonilla; place and date not 
given; from the "The Morning Paper" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Bonilla] President Roberto Reina's strong man, 
Civil Engineer Mario Reina Idiaquez, has made exclusive 
statements to HRN on the economic measures adopted by the 
liberal administration led by his brother, before his first 100 
days in office are completed. 
  [Reina] I believe that we have been working hard, both in 
the 
cabinet and in all institutions. 
  [Bonilla] Eng. Mario Reina, economic and legal adviser to 
President Reina's government, says that the executive machinery 
has already taken off even though many disagree. 
  [Reina] I say yes; I cannot understand how anyone can say 
that it has not taken off. There are many things to deal with 
and the various commissions at various levels are doing just 
that. 
  [Bonilla] There is strong criticism of the liberal 
government's economic cabinet headed by Juan Ferrera at the 
Finance and Public Credit Ministry, Delmer Urbizo Panting at the 
Economy and Commerce Ministry, and Hugo Noe Pino at the Central 
Bank of Honduras, and appointed [as heard] by Eng. Mario Reina. 
You claim, however, that the economic cabinet is the one that 
works the hardest. 
  [Reina] I believe that the economic cabinet works the 
hardest. As you know we were left in a desperate situation, with 
a large deficit. All previous programs are under review and 
this has been the economic cabinet's main task up to now. 
  [Bonilla] People say that these officials do not fulfill 
their job requirements? 
  [Reina] I do not think so. What has happened, as in the case 
of Juan errera, is that everyone is trying to determine how to 
stretch funds to pay all the pending debts. This poses a 
serious problem for him. In fact, because he is a serious 
person he is trying to do things right. 
  [Bonilla] What about restructuring the economic cabinet? 
  [Reina] Perfection is very difficult, of course, but I do 
not 
believe there is reason for a change, and it is working hard. 
  [Bonilla] What about deregulating fuel prices? 
  [Reina] Prices are deregulated so that they reach their 
market price. If international prices go up then prices in 
Honduras have to go up as well, otherwise fuel suppliers would 
have serious problems. This is what has been deregulated, and 
now some suppliers want the government to regulate prices. This 
is absurd because they were the first ones to ask that they be 
allowed to set their own profit levels. 
  [Bonilla] What about the hunger strike declared by members 
of 
the Civic-Popular Committee to protest the draft? 
  [Reina] A commission of jurists is making an in-depth study 
of this case, which is very delicate because it means a change 
to the Constitution, a constitutional reform. This strike is 
also in support of the government and the president, because I 
imagine they want to raise the awareness of the deputies for 
this change. I believe that this draft bill will be presented 
to Congress by Tuesday. From what the president has discussed 
up to now with the deputies and other branches of government, I 
believe that they are all aware that the Constitution should be 
reformed. 
  [Bonilla] Does Congress President Carlos Flores agree? 
  [Reina] Up to now he has also agreed. 
  [Bonilla] As economic adviser to the liberal administration 
you are considered by fellow party members, friends, and 
relatives as the boss of the Reina Idiaquez clan. You retired 
from private banking to work full time as adviser to the 
government of your brother, Carlos Roberto Reina. I understand 
that once in a while you slap him on the wrist if he fails to 
coordinate something in the best interests of the Honduran 
people. Is this true? 
  [Reina] No, I have never had a need to admonish him. We have 
always worked in agreement. My work with my brother has 
generally been in an advisory role. 
  [Bonilla] Are you retiring from private banking to give full 
time advice to your brother? 
  [Reina] No, no. I am already retired, therefore I have the 
time to be at my brother's side, such as I am doing now.

<F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The pacification process in northern Nicaragua, 
including a plan against criminal gangs -- the recently 
implemented Operation Triangle -- which led to the seizure of a 
large cocaine shipment, the relations between the Executive and 
Legislative Branches, and the economy were among the issues 
discussed at a cabinet meeting headed by President Violeta 
Chamorro and Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo. 
  The most salient issue discussed by the ministers during 
their four-and-a- half-hour meeting was the end of the rearmed 
saga on 15 April with the demobilization of the 3-80 Northern 
Front [FN 3- 80]. In this regard, Government Minister Alfredo 
Mendieta commented on the details of the disarmament plan and 
the reintegration into civilian life of the former FN 3-80 
combatants. Minister Mendieta also reported on the recently 
implemented Operation Triangle. 
  As for a plan against criminal gangs operating in northern 
and central Nicaragua, the ministers were not only briefed on 
actions by the National Police and the Sandinist People's Army, 
but on the determination of the Chamorro administration to 
complement them with legal actions. 
  In regard to the relations between the Executive and 
Legislative Branches, the ministers engaged in ample discussion 
on an agreement signed between the two on 12 March in which they 
recognize that the two branches must reach a consensus on the 
various laws that affect national life. 
  They also had a broad discussion on an agreement reached 
between government authorities and the top military leadership 
on the Code of Military Organization, Jurisdiction, and Social 
Security. 
  As for the economy, President Chamorro and Minister Lacayo 
instructed the ministers to switch their focus from 
macroeconomic to microeconomic aspects to uncover bureaucratic 
red tape and make official procedures easier for the population, 
especially those related to basic services such as health, 
energy, electricity, and customs.

observed for the 8 May elections in Panama City on 26 April] 
  [Text] 1. Government and private sector employees can leave

  [Text] Following a careful and thorough analysis of 
government plans, the resources and the methodology to carry 
them out, each of the presidential candidates, and the parties 
that have nominated them, the Pro-Fatherland Civilist Network 
[Red Civilista Pro Patria] decided, on Thursday, 28 April, to 
support the candidacies of and to recommend that all Civilists 
vote for Professor Ruben Dario Carles as president, Guillermo 
Quijano as first vice president, and Tomas Herrera as second 
vice president. 
  Without any alliance commitments to the dictatorial regime 
and full of patriotic desire to reconstruct our country 
following the economic, social, institutional, and ethical 
traumas it has endured, the members of the Pro-Fatherland 
Civilist Network emerge in the current political picture as a 
new, young, encouraging force worthy of credit after traveling a 
long road among negative factors that are so contagious. The 
members of the group have not demonstrated any tendency to fall 
into the traps set by corruption to catch those who do not have 
sufficient moral values to avoid any threat of contamination due 
to vocation, fear, or bribery. 
  The recognition that the Pro-Fatherland Civilist Network 
gives Professor Carles and his running mates is a valuable 
decoration, like those given by the people to those who deserve 
it. It is not the result of an intense propaganda campaign, but 
a logical result of an entire productive and honest life. 
  It is not a matter of political alliances, it is a vibrant 
invitation for Panamanian people to listen before making the 
correct decision at a time when so many people have their 
doubts. They will now be able to clearly see the road leading 
to a better Panama, alongside the Change '94 candidates, headed 
by Prof. Ruben Dario Carles.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Argentine Economy 
Minister Domingo Cavallo today charged the U.S. Government with 
creating "an adverse political atmosphere" by announcing the 
implementation of economic sanctions if Buenos Aires does not 
approve a patents law on pharmaceuticals, including the payment 
of royalties to foreign laboratories. 
  Presidential Media Secretary Raul Burzaco told journalists 
that despite U.S. pressure, Cavallo, who now is in Washington, 
informed Argentine President Carlos Menem that Argentina 
"remains in the race to enter NAFTA." 
  Burzaco indicated that the cabinet and the president 
reviewed 
the situation raised by the government of U.S. President Bill 
Clinton after Menem said on 27 April that "Argentina will not 
cease to function" if Washington implements sanctions against 
his country. 
  Cavallo told U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that 
Washington's pressure "will make more difficult the approval of 
a patents law on pharmaceuticals" in Argentina, a law that 
Congress has been studying for two years. 
  Argentine laboratories, which have a 56-percent share of the 
local pharmaceuticals market with yearly sales totaling $3 
billion, challenge the payment of royalties, involving annual 
payments of $500 million to foreign laboratories, mostly U.S. 
laboratories.

<F P=106> [Special report for NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS by Jose Maria Monzon] </F>
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Aug (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella moved stealthily through the corridors of the 
congressional building on 28 April to calm down Justicialist 
Party [PJ] senators over what immediate consequences the U.S. 
threat to commercially blacklist Argentina, and the latter's 
failure to approve the pharmaceutical patents law, may have. 
  The Argentine foreign minister reportedly explained in 
general terms the concrete meaning of the sanctions that 
Washington is threatening to levy, although he must have also 
dispensed a few sarcastic remarks about the senators' lack of 
political acumen in the handling of this issue, which plays a 
key role in the relations between the two countries. 
  This was the minister's reaction to the legislative maze, 
where the bill on patents got lost after the national executive 
branch sent it to the Senate in May 1993. The truth is that the 
bill became the target of a tug-of-war between the ruling party 
and the opposition, until it was finally left in the hands of a 
complex system of committees, three of them controlled by the 
opposition Radical Civic Union and the other two by the JP. 
  This allowed the opposition not only more elbow room, but 
also left it in control of the issue to deal with all the 
interested parties. In fact, the person who knows most about 
the subject in the Senate is the speaker for the opposition: 
Jose Genoud, senator for Mendoza Province. 
  Genoud favors a new patents law that will recognize the 
right 
of every inventor to produce and market his medicines, but 
unlike the administration he wants the law to set restrictions 
to prevent monopolies, and also believes that the law should 
give Argentine pharmaceutical laboratories a reasonable period 
of time to adjust. 
  The slumber of the ruling party was shattered earlier this 
week when reports from Washington indicated that U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor had officially notified Minister 
Domingo Cavallo that at the end of April Argentina will join the 
black list of countries that have not approved a pharmaceutical 
patents law, as large U.S. pharmaceutical industries want them 
to do. 
  The inclusion of our country on that list make us vulnerable 
to commercial sanctions, which does not mean they will be 
imposed immediately. 
  Kantor does not have the authority to determine the type of 
sanctions that will be imposed, or the moment for their 
implementation. His job is to point out which countries are, in 
his opinion, violating commercial commitments with the United 
States. 
  In order to understand the situation it is necessary to go 
back to 1991, when George Bush was still president and his 
representative was the inflexible Carla Hills. At that time 
Domingo Cavallo thought it was a good idea to use the issue of 
patents in negotiations. He promised to speed up the approval 
of the patents law, which was being pushed by U.S. laboratories, 
in exchange for more flexibility on the issue of the debt. 
  But the initiative could not prosper in Congress. The U.S. 
Embassy and Government then started pressuring the Menem 
administration to take up the issue with Justicialist 
legislators. However, executive branch recommendations have so 
far not fared well, and President Menem says only that the 
executive branch has sent the bill to Congress, and the issue is 
in the hands of legislators. 
  The government understands that even though the country is 
included on the black list, sanctions will not be imposed for at 
least a year. This period is enough for Congress to approve the 
GATT agreement, which would give Argentina the possibility of 
resorting to GATT's more flexible and benign requirements in the 
area of patents. If this is the case, the United States will 
find it harder to apply sanctions.

  [Text] Cordoba -- Governor Eduardo Angeloz has been invited 
to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton during the course of 
this year, on a date that has yet to be determined. The U.S. 
President sent him the invitation with Howard Glicken, who 
arrived in Cordoba on 26 April aboard a private plane to meet 
with Angeloz. 
  Glicken, a U.S. Democratic Party leader, played a major role 
in the organization of Clinton's presidential election campaign. 
The invitation was extended by the U.S. politician during a 
luncheon Angeloz gave at his home of Las Tejas. After this 
meeting, Glicken returned to Buenos Aires City aboard his plane. 
  The presence of the U.S. visitor was much discussed in the 
corridors of power in Cordoba. The invitation was interpreted 
as stemming from Angeloz's position as the possible Radical 
Civic Union presidential candidate for the 1995 elections, and 
also as an acknowledgement of his leadership within his province.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Apr (NA) -- Argentine President 
Carlos Menem today stated that the "same kind of people General 
(Juan Domingo) Peron expelled from Plaza de Mayo" in the 
seventies are waging a campaign against the Armed Forces. 
  The president added that "the very same group of young 
people 
who advocate Marxism and had nothing to say when vandals 
attacked La Tablada Regiment" are waging the campaign to 
besmirch the Armed Forces. 
  Menem met the crew of the Granville corvette that had 
participated in the Haiti embargo at the request of the United 
Nations. The ceremony took place this morning at the northern 
docks of the port of Buenos Aires. Defense Minister Oscar 
Camilion and high-ranking military officers also attended the 
ceremony. 
  In his speech to welcome the sailors, Menem accused those 
who 
are signing proclamations and staging demonstrations to demand 
an investigation into the death of Private Omar Carrasco of 
"trying to resuscitate the conflict between the Armed Forces and 
the people." 
  He thus criticized "those who take advantage of the 
unfortunate death of one soldier to pit sectors of Argentine 
society against one another." The president added that "these 
are the very same people who did not criticize the attack on La 
Tablada Regiment." 
  Speaking to Radio Municipal earlier, the president warned 
that certain youngsters, "incensed by fashionable ideologists, 
play the role of useful idiots" in an effort to "make certain 
ideas prevail through the use of violence." 
  He compared these groups to those "once expelled by General 
(Juan Domingo) Peron from Plaza de Mayo, although they bore 
different names and belonged to a different generation." Menem 
was referring to the Montoneros, who were forced to go 
underground after the Plaza de Mayo event. 
  At the welcoming ceremony for the Granville corvette, Menem 
said: "We are sorry for what happened to the soldier in Zapala, 
and are making an effort to find those responsible" for the 
murder of Private Omar Carrasco. 
  "The very same people who now exude hatred had nothing to 
say 
about the soldiers who were shot down during the attack" on La 
Tablada Regiment, on 23 January 1990, "although they, too, had 
fathers and mothers," the president said. 
  Without calling them by name, Menem also lashed out at those 
in the south who are "staging demonstrations and signing 
proclamations which, based on crude lies, advocate hatred rather 
than peace." 
  Menem stated that the murder of Private Carrasco "is 
something we are all against," but he criticized "those who 
always try to take advantage of this kind of thing to cause 
chaos and anarchy." 
  Menem said that "this should never again happen in 
Argentina," and voiced his hope that "there should never be a 
repetition of Argentina's sorrowful and tragic recent history." 
  In his statement to Radio Municipal, President Menem 
indicated that "the signs, the posters, the hatreds, the people 
who made armed struggle a common event in this part of the 
continent, are back." 
  Although Menem said that "there are few of them," he added 
that they could "prepare the ground for what could come if we do 
not stop them in their tracks in time." 
  He stated: "Many of these young people play the role of 
useful idiots." He pointed out: "If you were to ask some of 
these -- fortunately few -- people who Che Guevara was, you will 
find that they do not have the slightest idea." 
  He added: "They know about Che's appearance, his personal 
style, his look [preceding word in English] as they say 
nowadays, but they know nothing about his ideology."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella by Ana </F>
Gerschenson; date and place not given] 
  [Text] [Gerschenson] Does the government have a date for 
President Carlos Menem's trip to London? 
  [Di Tella] Conditions are not right yet. We have meetings 
scheduled for the end of July to discuss the issues of oil 
exploration and fishing. Other issues are also pending, like 
the British opposition to installing the Antarctic Treaty 
Secretariat in Argentina. Then we also have the problem of the 
arms embargo. 
  [Gerschenson] Ambassador Mario Campora told LA PRENSA a few 
days ago that Menem will travel to London "shortly." 
  [Di Tella, laughing] Well, let us hope it will be so. 
  [Gerschenson] It was even mentioned that Menem's visit could 
occur before the end of the year... 
  [Di Tella] Look, "there are no schedules without 
objectives." 
If we resolve those issues before the end of the year, well, it 
could be... 
  [Gerschenson] How would you resolve the problem of oil 
exploration? 
  [Di Tella] It is complex. I feel encouraged by the fact that 
there will be a meeting, but I am not optimistic about the 
results. 
  [Gerschenson] What do you think might happen? 
  [Di Tella] Well, nothing...which means Argentina will have 
to 
legally object to any company attempting to explore for oil in 
the zone. And more so if that company embarks in oil 
exploitation in the area. 
  [Gerschenson] But the islanders have already announced the 
unilateral sale of oil licenses... 
  [Di Tella] If the deals are approved by us it will be all 
right. Otherwise, we will object. Cooperation is indispensable. 
  [Gerschenson] Please describe the legal mechanisms Argentina 
intends to use? 
  [Di Tella] First we will send "letters of discomfort" 
[preceding words in English] to the British Government. They 
will say: "Any company cooperating in the exploitation of our 
oil will be held legally responsible." We will then submit any 
cases to all pertinent international courts. 
  [Gerschenson] Are we negotiating the lifting of the military 
embargo that was imposed by Great Britain in 1982? 
  [Di Tella] I trust and hope the embargo will disappear 
within 
a prudent period -- which will not be two days or two weeks -- 
because it is anachronistic. It will happen sooner or latter. 
  [Gerschenson] What is the status of the contract to supply 
engines for our frigates that Rolls Royce never delivered as a 
consequence of the embargo? 
  [Di Tella] Well, we have problems. I talked with [British 
Foreign Secretary] (Douglas) Hurd about the matter. I have the 
impression there has been a relaxation of the ban because we 
achieved what we wanted with the radar [fitted to the Skyhawk 
planes purchased from the United States]. But I cannot say 
anything further on this issue at this time. 
  [Gerschenson] How are relations over the Malvinas Islands? 
  [Di Tella] Argentina is number 16 in the world. Our word 
carries increasing weight. This is being clearly noted by the 
British and by the islanders. Besides, we have repeatedly 
stated that we respect the islanders way of life. 
  [Gerschenson] Will Argentina respect the islanders desires 
as 
proposed by Great Britain? 
  [Di Tella] We want to respect the British Parliament's 
decision. They are the ones who must approve the treaty 
recognizing sovereignty [as published]. It is clear that 
British legislators's decisions depends basically on the opinion 
of the islanders. That is the way things are... 
  [Gerschenson] But there is also the possibility of us 
becoming the richest country in the world and the islanders 
still wanting to remain British... 
  [Di Tella] That is quite possible. We have not found a 
solution to the problem in the last 160 years. 
  [Gerschenson] When will the job of clearing the islands' 
minefields start? 
  [Di Tella] I think it will start this year. First, the U.S. 
engineers will evaluate the situation in the field. We and the 
islanders want the result to be 100 percent effective. 
  [Gerschenson] When do you think you will be able to travel 
to 
Puerto Argentino [Port Stanley]? 
  [Di Tella] So far one islander has invited me to go to the 
island once the clearing of the minefields is over. he asked me 
to walk through the minefields to check if the job was done 
well. I told him I am willing to do that once the job is 
finished. 
  [Gerscheson] What do you feel about holding a post that is 
almost openly sought by various members of your party, including 
[Interior Minister Carlos] Ruckauf or even [Defense Minister 
Oscar] Camilion? 
  [Di Tella] I am offended by your remark that only two 
individuals want my position. I think 33 million people want 
it. [the entire country's population]. 
  [Gerschenson] It is said that you have direct contact with 
islanders when you travel to London. 
  [Di Tella] Yes, I hold informal meetings with them. 
  [Gerschenson] What do you tell them? 
  [Di Tella] That Argentina is more attractive than ever. That 
the Argentine threat does not exist because we are against 
violent solutions. I remind them that not one Argentine has a 
different opinion. I tell them we will claim sovereignty for 
ever [preceding two words in English]. 
  [Gerschenson] And what do they say? 
  [Di Tella] Well...they tell me they will be British for ever 
[preceding two words in English].

<F P=106> [Report over video by unidentified reporter, including </F>
recorded statements by peasant leader Felix Santos; Bolivian 
Labor Federation leader Juan de la Cruz; and Bolivian Social 
Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Unidentified reporter] The initial evaluation of 
the Bolivian Labor Federation, COB, and the General Trade Union 
Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia, CSUTCB, shows that 
a large number of peasants all over the country blocked various 
highways in support for COB demands and also to draw the 
administration's attention to their own petitions. 
  COB leader Juan de la Cruz and CSUTCB leader Felix Santos 
stated that members of the two organizations participated in the 
demonstrations but, in many cases, the sons of peasants who are 
doing their military service prevented road blocks. 
  [Begin recording] [Santos] In Oruro the military (?cleared 
the road blocks) in (Virauna), and many peasants reported that 
the soldiers had their faces painted. The peasants recognized 
several of their sons among the painted faces. It is very bad 
for the peasants to see their children being used in such a 
cowardly manner by the government. It is a pity that things 
have gone so far. 
  [De la Cruz] We have confirmed information that three groups 
of peasants totalling some 20,000 people are blocking roads in 
Santa Cruz. In Cochabamba, especially in (Parotani) district, 
along the Cochabamba-Oruro highway, and along the 
Santacruz-Cochabamba highway through the Chapare region, there 
are approximately 30,000 peasants blocking the roads. There are 
also peasant roadblocks along the Oruro-La Paz highway in 
Caracollo and Vila Vila, although the latter roadblock 
reportedly has been cleared, the peasants are still 
demonstrating along the highways. The same thing is happening 
in Potosi, Tarija and Santa Cruz. 
  [Reporter] Meanwhile, workers have been demonstrating in 
various departmental capitals, but police and military forces 
prevented the demonstrators from reaching the downtown areas. 
This led to clashes between workers and policemen. Some people 
were injured and streets were destroyed. Social Communications 
Minister Ernesto Machicado criticized the vandals, adding that 
the demonstrations were politically motivated because they were 
staged to secure the reelection of certain COB leaders at the 
COB national congress scheduled to take place on 1 June. 
  [Machicado] It appears that there is a power struggle within 
the COB which is getting ready for the elections at which the 
new members of the executive board will be chosen. There are 
several candidates and many people want to get elected to the 
COB executive board. It is obvious that those who fight the 
administration the most are likely to become the most acceptable 
candidates. I think that this is what is going on. I believe 
all this street violence and the strikes are part of a political 
campaign, not a labor struggle. 
  [Reporter] The minister lamented that demonstrations staged 
by COB leaders to serve their own interests are harming 
everyone. [end recording]

  [Text] The blockading of roads on 28 April has had very 
little effect on everyday life. The Campesino Confederation of 
Bolivia issued a communique calling on brother campesinos to 
remain calm, adding that it remains expectant and hopes that the 
government will satisfy the needs of the campesino sector. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] The blockading of 
roads is going ahead as scheduled, but in a minimal way. Here 
we have video of the events that took place. At the national 
level [words indistinct] and we have strict control by the 
police and the Armed Forces. Trucks coming from La Paz were 
able to circulate normally [words indistinct] 
  [Unidentified teacher] We are rural teachers and we have 
given all our support to our campesino comrades who have today 
called for the blockading of roads at the national level. 
Therefore, we are supporting them. 
  [Reporter] There was intense police control and this made 
possible the normal flow of traffic (?with the exception) of the 
La Paz-El Alto thruway, where demonstrators blocked the flow of 
traffic with a large amount of stones until police intervened. 
They did so in this way: 
  [Second unidentified reporter] And this was the panorama 
that 
was observed during the early afternoon: 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] we are now with Under 
Secretary 
of Government Hugo San Martin, who made the following evaluation: 
  [San Martin] We have had two [words indistinct]. One in 
Cochabamba, between [name indistinct] and San Pedro, and the 
other in Potosi, in the locality of (Macha) [words indistinct]. 
  These have been the only two important blockades. There have 
been other isolated blockades, which were later dismantled with 
the intervention of the Armed Forces. 
  [Reporter] One incident is lamentable. The death of that 
little girl who died in a truck that was intercepted by 
campesinos who were blockading a sector of our country. 
  [San Martin] In the locality of [name indistinct] in Tarija 
Department, we lament the death last night of a little [age 
indistinct] year old girl. This is very regrettable. She was 
in one of the trucks that were blockaded and regretfully this 
little girl died from the cold. [Words indistinct] 
  [Reporter] Finally, he explained that a large number of 
campesinos did not obey the measure. He stressed that the 
police control will continue because the pressure being applied 
by the COB continues. This is in strict compliance with the 
Constitution. 
  It seems the blockading of roads called for by the 
campesinos 
took place in an atmosphere of nearly total calm. It must be 
noted that [words indistinct] by the Armed Forces. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The street clashes that took place yesterday have 
ended and there will be no demonstrations in La Paz today. 
Moreover, the hunger strike sponsored by the COB [Bolivian Labor 
Federation] is beginning to lose strength. 
  Health workers reached an agreement with the government 
yesterday for a 12 percent salary increase for this sector. 
Thus, their hunger strike has ended. Approximately 600 people 
throughout the country returned home happy after several days on 
a voluntary hunger strike. This will cause difficulties for the 
COB in view of the possibility that other sectors follow suit, 
thus weakening the united struggle. Right now the COB is holding 
a nationwide meeting to assess the situation. 
  [Begin unidentified COB representative recording] The 
nationwide meeting will assess the current state of events and 
decide what course the conflict will follow in view of the 
prospects of a solution. I want to point out that during last 
night's meeting, the COB reiterated its willingness to 
negotiate. We are aware that this conflict must be solved for 
the country's sake. The solution is in the government's hands. 
[end recording] 
  It is quite likely that during today's meeting, the COB 
might 
decide to suspend street demonstrations as a sign of its 
willingness to negotiate.

  [Text] Yesterday, the health workers and the government 
reached an agreement by which the workers received a 12 percent 
salary increase. Therefore, after solving their problem, the 
health workers, about 600 of them, decided to lift the hunger 
strike and left for home, happy after several days of fasting. 
  This agreement could create problems for the COB [Bolivian 
Labor Federation] in view of the possibility that other sectors 
may do the same, thus breaking up the united struggle. The COB 
said, however, that this agreement will not weaken the workers' 
struggle for their demands, which will again be negotiated. 
  Yesterday the government asked the COB to lift the coercive 
measures. Today, after a COB assembly, a decision was made to 
maintain the hunger strike and the indefinite strike of some 
sectors, and to suspend the street demonstrations over the 
entire country, starting this afternoon, until next Sunday when 
the march celebrating Labor Day will be held. 
  [Begin COB Executive Secretary Oscar Salas recording] This 
demonstration of flexibility, of political will shown by the COB 
and the workers, should be responded to by the government 
through new proposals which would serve as a basis for 
discussion to reach a solution to the conflict. [end recording] 
  On 1 May, workers will concentrate in the Plaza San 
Francisco 
to start the march to celebrate Labor Day. And on 3 May, the 
COB will hold a national assembly. 
  The government has, however, a different opinion of the 
decision made by the COB. The government believes that all 
coercive measures should be lifted to continue with the 
negotiations tonight. 
  [Begin Communications Minister Ernesto Machicao recording] 
The information I have about the COB's decision is still 
unofficial in reference to the efforts made over the last few 
days and weeks to have the coercive measures lifted. [end 
recording] 
  We should remember that the COB said it would only stop the 
street demonstrations, not the hungers strikes and the 
indefinite strike. But despite this decision, the step taken by 
the health workers is an important factor in the COB-government 
negotiations. 
  [Begin Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters recording] The salary 
increase granted to the health workers and the increase we are 
studying for the teachers will be implemented thanks to the 
savings made in each of these sectors. The salaries paid to 
people who did not work but got paid as a result of corruption 
will now be used for the salary increases in those sectors. 
This will be one of the main proposals we will take today to 
the COB. [end recording] 
  The COB, however, has not lost its hope of getting a higher 
salary increase percentage.

  [Excerpt] The Free Bolivia Movement [MBL] has voiced 
support for President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and asked for 
solutions to the social problems. The MBL belongs to the 
governing coalition. It was represented at Government House 
today by Deputies Max Fernandez and Juan del Granado. 
  Del Granado explained why the MBL had come to Government 
House to speak to the president of the Republic. First he 
mentioned the MBL's support for the executive branch. 
  [Begin Del Granado recording] We came to say three things 
which, I believe, were welcomed by the constitutional president. 
First, we expressed the MBL's support for the president and the 
government in view of this very difficult moment; second, we 
voiced our deep concern over this obvious difficulty in solving 
a conflict that affects and concerns everyone of us; and third, 
we expressed the MBL's belief that the government must adopt a 
more flexible stance so that, stemming from the president's 
social awareness, we may find a solution for Bolivia. [end 
recording] 
  The Solidarity Civic Union, headed by Max Fernandez, which 
is 
another Nationalist Revolutionary Movement government partner, 
voiced its concern through Deputy Jaime Ponce over the social 
crisis the country is enduring. 
  [Begin Ponce recording] I have repeatedly said it is 
regrettable that this problem cannot be solved due to the lack 
of clear dialogue between the two parties. I believe dialogue 
is feasible when the two parties -- the government and the 
social sectors -- are willing to negotiate. Violence leads 
nowhere. I am very worried about the way in which the Bolivian 
democratic stabilization process is developing. Every Bolivian 
citizen will be affected if democracy is destabilized because we 
would return to the dictatorships or tyrannies that ruled in the 
past. I do not want to return to the past. This is why we are 
upholding an open dialogue and want the government to explore 
the possibilities, within the framework of the national budget, 
of solving the workers salary problem. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Communications Secretary General Mauricio Antezana 
has reiterated that the government firmly maintains its 
commitment to the Bolivian workers and to low income families. 
He said the programs being implemented, among them those of 
popular participation, capitalization, and education reform, 
seek to help the poor and to make the changes the country needs. 
  [Begin Antezana recording] The workers must realize that the 
government understands their situation and that it acts in 
solidarity with their demands because they are fair demands. 
However they must also understand, especially the labor leaders, 
that the real situation of our national economy does not allow 
us to immediately carry out a salary policy that will create an 
inflationary spiral. [end recording] 
  Antezana added that the government goals are: to avoid 
raising fuel prices and to rationalize and streamline the 
economy. These goals seek to protect the poor by offering them 
a real sustainable salary increase. The communications 
secretary added that the national budget is an innovative tool 
to benefit the needy. 
  [Begin Antezana recording] The national budget allocations 
are mainly concentrated in social investments. This is a new 
element that represents a great innovation compared with the 
system used in the budgets of the past few years. The national 
budget includes the innovation that this year it incorporates 
the participation of the people. By doing so, it establishes a 
discipline for the distribution of income among the provinces. 
The Popular Participation Law establishes a fair distribution 
of resources according to the number of inhabitants of certain 
municipalities, and particularly benefits the provinces. This 
means the national budget is based on a social principle and 
goal. The government's overall economic policy also seeks to 
benefit the low-income sector and all workers. 
  The government asks the Bolivian people for understanding in 
these difficult moments. The people must understand that this 
is not a simple provision. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 27 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has stated that Bolivia is running the 
risk of becoming the target of "narcoguerrilla" actions. In a 
statement published by the La Paz newspaper ULTIMA HORA today, 
Sanchez de Lozada explained that in Chapare, a region in the 
central part of Cochabamba Department, "the atmosphere is ripe 
for the establishment of drug cartels or the operations of 
narco-guerrilla groups." [passage omitted] 
  Sanchez de Lozada stated that "all coca leaves produced" in 
the Chapare region are used to manufacture cocaine, not for the 
traditional and legal uses of this leaf. [passage omitted] 
  Sanchez de Lozada also announced that his administration 
wants to draft a new drug enforcement policy in coordination 
with the United States Government. 
  "This is very important for them (the North Americans), 
because even though they have acknowledged after many years that 
the responsibility for this situation should be shared, we must 
come up with a proposal capable of truly resolving this 
problem," the Bolivian president said. 
  Sanchez de Lozada agreed that drug trafficking is one of 
Bolivia's most serious problems, and stressed that it 
jeopardizes Bolivia's relations with the rest of the world.

  [Text] Bonn, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar Quiroga today ended his stay in Bonn, the main 
phase of his three-day visit to Germany. During his visit to 
Bonn, Aranibar encouraged German business people to invest in 
Bolivia. 
  Aranibar, who had a chance to address a large audience of 
private German business people during a meeting at the 
Confederation of German Industry and Commerce Chambers, tried to 
interest business people in a series of privatization projects 
and some significant industrial projects. 
  During a news conference this afternoon, Aranibar explained 
that he had told his audience about the capitalization project 
involving some public enterprises in the natural gas and oil, 
electric power, telecommunications, railway, smelting, and air 
transportation fields. 
  The German business people also showed great interest in the 
plan to build a gas pipeline between Santa Cruz central Bolivia 
and Sao Paulo, Brazil. This represents a "megaproject" for 
Bolivia and is necessary for Brazil's energy supply system. 
  The Germans also were interested in the plans for Ilo, the 
Peruvian town on the Pacific coast where Bolivia, after an 
agreement signed with the Peruvian Government, intends to build 
an industrial and tourism free zone and hopes to turn it into an 
important port for the shipment of its exports. 
  Aranibar, who believes the Germans are the right people for 
this project due to their experience and technology, also will 
show the plans for Ilo port to business people in Berlin, with 
whom he will meet on 27 April in the morning, and especially to 
those in Hamburg, the great hanseatic town and German port, 
where he will end his visit that same afternoon. 
  During his two-day visit to Bonn, Aranibar had a tight 
agenda 
that ended on 25 April with a meeting with his German 
counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, with whom he signed a financial 
cooperation agreement for 50 million German marks ($30 million), 
earmarked for potable water and sewage infrastructure projects, 
as well as for the preservation of natural resources. 
  Aranibar announced that the German-Bolivian Joint Commission 
will meet next July in Germany to establish the framework for 
future cooperation between the two countries, among them 
cooperation for the institutional consolidation of the recently 
created La Paz Justice Ministry. 
  According to the minister, during all the meetings held in 
Bonn with politicians, legislators, representatives of 
organizations or business people he found great interest and 
understanding for the efforts toward political and economic 
reform in Bolivia.

<F P=106> [Article from Zozimo's column: "Chemical Thing"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Government suspects there will be at least 
one chair empty at the Americas summit scheduled to take place 
in Miami in December. That which is meant for President Itamar 
Franco. 
  The White House has already received some signals that the 
Brazilian president is not willing to attend the summit 
organized by President Bill Clinton, with the participation of 
the chiefs of state of the entire hemisphere, except Cuba. 
  The fact that Brazil will have a newly-elected president by 
that date serves as an excuse for Franco's lack of interest in 
attending the summit, the intention of which is to implement a 
political and trade integration project for the three Americas. 
The reason for Franco's absence, however, goes beyond the date 
issue. 
  According to a small circle of friends close to Planalto 
Palace, he simply does not like Clinton. Franco, who is a simple 
and frank man who appreciates a good piece of coconut-baked 
pork, dislikes the president of the most powerful country in the 
world. It is a personal matter. What can be done? It must be a 
chemical thing.

  [Text] Santiago, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Today, Chilean Foreign 
Minister Carlos Figueroa stated strengthening the 
internationalization of the Chilean economy is one of the great 
objectives of Chilean foreign policy. During a lecture at a 
private university, Figueroa described the guidelines of the 
foreign policy of President Eduardo Frei's administration. 
  Figueroa said negotiating for a free trade agreement with 
the 
United States, or Chile's acceptance as a NAFTA member, should 
be the government's priority goals. He explained that in order 
to step up the internationalization of the Chilean economy, 
alliances and agreements that will ensure the country's 
appropriate insertion into the great world markets are necessary. 
  Regarding the European Union, Figueroa said this area is 
very 
important to Chilean foreign policy because, in his opinion, the 
European economy represents the largest integrated market in the 
world and is one of the most important megamarkets for Chile. 
  Another subject mentioned by the foreign minister as being 
of 
great importance to his foreign policy are relations with Latin 
American countries, which should be relations that would 
contribute to a climate of democratic stability. Figueroa 
pointed out the need to participate, in a selective manner, in 
initiatives to promote peace, the broadening of democracy, 
respect for human rights, and development and equity in the 
international system. 
  The minister said the current government, which was sworn in 
11 March, hopes to implement a lasting foreign policy that will 
provide continuity. That foreign policy should respect 
international law and agreements and promote the legal and 
peaceful solution to controversies and the search for peace.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  Copper Cathodes Shipped From Iquique </H8>
  The Cerro Colorado Mining Company has shipped its first load 
of copper cathodes to Japan and Taiwan. The shipment totals 500 
tons and marks the return of mining activity to Iquique 
Province. Copper now accounts for 10 percent of the cargo 
passing through the port of Iquique, which handles mostly 
fishing industry products and goods entering the Free Zone. 
Copper's share is expected to increase when the three mines in 
the area (Cerro Colorado, Quebrada Blanca, and Dona Ines de 
Collahuasi) are in operation. The Cerro Colorado company, which 
is part of the Canadian mining corporation Rio Algom, views the 
shipment as the start of a new phase and anticipates exporting 
about 40,000 tons annually. The company's open-cast mine is 
located 120 km east of Iquique and represents an investment of 
$290 million. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 28 March p C8) 
<H5>  Economy Minister on Export Strategy </H5>
  At a meeting with the Association of Exporters of 
Manufactured Products (Asexma), Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia 
announced that Chile's exports are expected to exceed $12.5 
billion in 1994, with $9.7 billion in goods and more than $2.8 
billion in services. The government has set two priorities in 
its export strategy: identifying emerging markets for Chilean 
products, and taking specific actions to increase 
competitiveness. These actions could include quality 
certification, environmental standards, increased investment in 
infrastructure, and expansion of worker training. He noted that 
the Latin American market has been expanding and diversifying 
while sales to the EU and Japan have declined over the past 
year. Thus, the government will emphasize trade liberalization 
in the region. Garcia stressed the need for flexible machanisms 
to react quickly to changes in international economic relations. 
He stated that the Economy Ministry has come to the conclusion 
that existing export incentives are inadequate under the current 
circumstances and must be reviewed with special attention to 
export diversification in both products and markets. (Santiago 
LA NACION in Spanish 30 March p 16) 
<H5>  Government Economic Policies </H5>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony for the academic year at 
the 
Andres Bello University, Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia 
presented an outline of the government's economic policies. He 
reiterated the government's intention to change the Law on State 
Enterprises to modernize the public sector and ensure greater 
efficiency. He said that a sustained increase in productivity is 
required in order to reach the goal of 6 percent economic growth 
this year, and noted that controlling inflation means "avoiding 
any populist temptation concerning public spending, salaries, 
subsidies, and taxes; and moderating private spending on 
consumption and wage demands in excess of productivity." The 
government will continue to increase programs to improve income 
distribution, and proposes to create a national job training 
system, a workers training fund, and a national employment 
information and guidance system. The government is also 
concerned about expanding the process of collective negotiation, 
creating unemployment insurance, and promoting competition in 
all areas possible. These steps would involve a significant 
revision and strengthening of regulatory agencies and the 
Antitrust Law. (Santiago LA NACION in Spanish 1 April p 17) 
<H5>  Study on NAFTA Readiness </H5>
  Two Chilean economists have prepared a study at the request 
of the Canadian Government on whether Chile is prepared to 
accede to NAFTA. Fernan Ibanez and Felipe Larrain presented the 
study to the Chilean-Canadian Chamber of Commerce. One of their 
main conclusions is that Chile is well-prepared to enter NAFTA, 
given the country's macroecomic stability and open and 
transparent commercial law and business practices. Chile has 
also had a lengthy and active tradition of participation in 
international agreements such as the GATT. Chile would need a 
minimal number of legal and procedural changes to comply with 
NAFTA, because most tariff rates and government procurement 
practices meet NAFTA standards. The study concludes that Chile 
would benefit from guaranteed access to a large market; an 
impartial conflict resolution mechanism; uniform regulations for 
trade among four countries, especially regarding nontariff 
matters; and assured access to goods and services. (Santiago LA 
NACI0N in Spanish 2 April p 17)

<F P=106> [From the "AM-PM News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A few minutes ago, the national government decided 
to decree a state of internal disturbance to prevent the release 
of incarcerated guerrillas and drug traffickers. Hans Sarmiento 
has the story. 
  [Begin recording] [Sarmiento] This is the third time the 
government has declared a state of internal disturbance to avert 
a legal crisis. This time the state of internal disturbance has 
been declared amid a dispute between Prosecutor General Gustavo 
de Greiff and the national government. The prosecutor general, 
however, made peace with the president at the beginning of the 
meeting [not further identified] and accepted the state of 
internal disturbance even though he had previously opposed it. 
  [De Greiff] The president convinced me how appropriate the 
measure was and how dangerous the mass release of inmates was. 
I accepted because I am a reasonable, not arrogant, man. 
  [Sarmiento] Some 860 inmates will have to wait two more 
months, the period of the state of internal disturbance, for 
their cases to be considered. At the end of this period, 
however, there is no guarantee they will be released. 
  [Unidentified speaker] We Colombians are inclined to declare 
a state of internal disturbance and to live in a state of 
exception. I think Colombians must trust a government and a 
state that are willing to adopt timely measures to maintain 
public order. 
  [Sarmiento] As part of the state of internal disturbance, a 
judicial emergency was decreed, and trials with faceless judges 
were suspended for 60 days. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 Apr (AFP) -- Gustavo de 
Greiff, Colombian prosecutor general, has stated in a letter 
sent to Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin that the Colombian 
Government should protest to his U.S. counterpart for meddling 
in his justice decisions. Thus, de Greiff has responded to a 
note by the U.S. Government protesting several of his actions, 
which are considered too lenient regarding the drug-trafficking 
issue. "Personally or officially, I find a government's attempts 
to influence in any way the sovereign decisions that should be 
made by Colombian judicial officials as unacceptable," the 
prosecutor general said in the letter to the Foreign Ministry. 
  The Colombian Government is studying a reply to the U.S. 
protest note, which, according to the Foreign Ministry, will 
take some time, given the legal complexity of the issue. 
  The Colombian prosecutor general has been the target of an 
avalanche of criticism this past month stemming from his 
statements that the best way to combat drug trafficking would be 
to legalize drugs. 
  Subsequently, he had contacted a U.S. judge who is 
processing 
Dandenys Munoz (a Medellin cartel member suspected of planting a 
bomb in a commercial plane in 1989 causing 107 victims) saying 
he has no evidence against Munoz. U.S. authorities say de Greiff 
has requested, on nine occasions, to meet with another member of 
the cartel, Carlos Alzate, detained in a Santa Fe de Bogota 
jail. The prosecutor general has denied making such a request.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff has asked U.S. 
authorities to stop U.S. officials from attacking him without 
justification. De Greiff has also called on the U.S. Government 
to continue cooperating with the exchange of evidence, as this 
will advance the end of the scourge of drug trafficking. 
  Upon returning from a trip to the UK and the United States, 
the official said in a communique that he held a news conference 
in Washington and had emphatically rejected the charges that 
drug traffickers have infiltrated the government and that there 
is corruption in top government positions and in the legislative 
and judicial branches, as claimed by a convict at a U.S. Senate 
subcommission. 
  The prosecutor said that in his opinion, the procedures to 
bring drug traffickers to trial and the penalty reduction policy 
in effect should continue. De Greiff said those who say drug 
traffickers are given lenient treatment or illegal sentence 
reductions are liars. "No pardons or amnesties of any kind have 
even been considered," he said. De Greiff said cooperation with 
justice cannot be conditioned to forcing judicial officials to 
use given evidence, prior to consultation of their decisions, 
with the country that gives the evidence. 
  De Greiff had told the U.S. media he had not proposed drug 
legalization as a way to stop the use of illegal drugs but, 
rather, as a way to stop drug traffickers from obtaining the 
excessive profits they are making. This decision has to be 
adopted, however, by the international community as a whole, he 
added. 
  The official said Senator Kerry could not affirm, if he acts 
in good faith, that regarding one drug trafficker (Julio Fabio 
Urdinola), who surrendered to justice, the Prosecutor's Office 
has reached an agreement to give him a four- or a 
four-and-one-half-year prison sentence. "There has been no 
trial provision, much less an out-of-court agreement on this 
issue," he added. 
  De Greiff arrived in the UK on 15 April and met with the UK 
prosecutor general, the secretary of state of foreign affairs, 
officials of the Investigation Center on Drugs and Health 
Behavior, and other officials and parliamentarians of that 
nation. During those meetings, de Greiff explained the scope of 
Colombian justice and thanked them for the material and 
intellectual aid the UK has given to Colombia in this field.

  [Text] [Reporter] We salute Dr. Antonio Navarro Wolff, 
presidential candidate for the 19 April Movement Democratic 
Alliance. Dr. Navarro, what is your opinion of the letter sent 
hours ago by Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff to Colombian 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin on a diplomatic protest note sent 
by the U.S. Department of State to the Colombian Government 
complaining about the attitude of our nation's top prosecutor? 
Good morning. 
  [Navarro] Good morning. I think the prosecutor general is 
right in his conflict with sectors of the U.S. Government and 
Congress because I think the attitude of placing all the blame 
on us, which was assumed during the Reagan and Bush 
administrations, prevails again in the United States. 
  I think the prosecutor general has complied with legal 
norms; 
he has in no way violated the law. The prosecutor general did 
not draft the Penal Procedure Code; the government and the 
Congress did. Thus, [words indistinct] only enforcing it. 
  I think the prosecutor general has been mistreated. I think 
the summit of governors, which began in Popayan yesterday, 
should defend the dignified and sovereign position assumed by 
the prosecutor general. I do not know whether the government is 
somewhat caught up between [words indistinct] and the need to 
defend its judicial system. What is indeed true, however, is 
that the summit of governors [words indistinct] must support the 
prosecutor general and reject the discriminatory and unfair 
treatment of him by U.S. authorities.

<F P=106> [Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper </F>
discusses his economic policy proposals during a meeting of the 
29th Convention of Banking and Financing Institutions held 8 
April in Cartagena] 
  [Text] Cartagena -- By means of a social agreement covering 
competitiveness, prices, and salaries, candidate Ernesto Samper 
proposes to lower the inflation rate quickly in the next four 
years. In that way he will eliminate devaluation, as he feels 
that cannot continue to be the tool used to reduce the cost of 
living. These are the main proposals of the economic program he 
will apply if elected president. 
<H5>  Taxes </H5>
  It is overhasty, inconsistent, and populist to suggest a new 
tax reform to reduce the tax burden without knowing what the 
fiscal situation will be in the next few months. 
<H5>  Revaluation </H5>
  A stable real rate of exchange will be a central goal. To 
achieve that, the support of the entire private sector is needed. 
<H5>  Banking </H5>
  There will be no financial reform; on the contrary, there 
will be stability in regulations and minimal government 
intervention. There will be strict controls, but they will be 
highly technical in nature. 
<H5>  Credit </H5>
  Commercial credit needs to reach more users and economic 
sectors. 
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  An urban credit system will be established for small 
businesses and industries, supported by a rediscount fund 
(Finurbano [expansion not given]), sustained by external lines 
of credit and government and budget resources. In addition, 
there will be a rural savings and credit network similar to the 
English postal savings system. 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  Credit will be democratized and an ambitious land title 
program will be implemented. This will help a large number of 
campesinos who now have no formal property titles. That will 
make it easier for them to obtain commercial financing and use 
their assets in a modern productive system. 
<H5>  Macroeconomy </H5>
  Stabilization of the real exchange rate will first of all 
require bringing inflationary pressures under control. In his 
opinion, exchange stability and control of inflation are 
interrelated goals. 
<H5>  Fiscal Policy </H5>
  Controlling inflation will be helped by coordinating fiscal 
and monetary policy, which will avert demand-driven inflationary 
pressures. 
<H5>  Cusiana Resources </H5>
  To handle the oil bonanza, an investment stabilization fund 
will be set up to manage part of the Cusiana resources. 
<H5>  Capital </H5>
  He will propose to the stock exchanges the creation of a 
mixed corporation which will actively promote the development of 
the capital market. This agency will promote the stock market 
with businesses that are not listed on the stock exchange and 
the development of instruments like stock purchase programs and 
project financing. 
<H5>  Security </H5>
  Efforts will be made to improve "peace management." All 
departments of the government will be involved in creating 
conditions that will make the return of the former armed rebels 
to society feasible. 
<H5>  Economic Liberalization </H5>
  Colombia's closed domestic market will be eliminated in 
order 
to foster competitiveness, more exports, growth, and better jobs 
and salaries. A great deal of private investment will be 
stimulated.

<F P=106> [Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana </F>
discusses his economic policy proposals during a meeting of the 
29th Convention of Banking and Financial Institutions, 8 Apr in 
Cartagena] 
  [Text] Cartagena -- According to candidate Andres Pastrana, 
the essential and most equitable goal is to reduce inflation to 
levels under 10 percent in the next four years. The tax burden 
should also be reduced and improved coordination with the board 
of directors of the Bank of the Republic is needed in order to 
put an end to revaluation. The views of the conservative 
presidential candidate follow. 
<H5>  Taxes </H5>
  The maximum income tax rate will be reduced from 37.5 to 30 
percent. Tax instruments will also be improved. 
<H5>  Revaluation </H5>
  Quick action will be taken on this front, as it has become 
an 
obstacle blocking private investment. Revaluation is not caused 
by an influx of foreign capital or the return of money from 
Colombian citizens. 
<H5>  Drug Traffic </H5>
  One cause of revaluation is excessive drug trafficking 
revenues, which have totally distorted the exchange rate. He 
will oppose legalizing drugs. 
<H5>  Banking </H5>
  In an open economy the development of universal banking is 
desirable, so the existence of a fragmented financial sector, in 
which credit is directed toward goals preset by the government, 
loses its rationale. 
<H5>  Bank Reserves </H5>
  He plans to reduce this burden on the financial system, thus 
helping financial institutions to compete internationally. 
<H5>  Credit </H5>
  Government intervention in the private sector's financial 
management will be minimal. Restricting the credit of savings 
and loan institutions will stimulate even more the influx of 
foreign capital to finance construction projects. 
<H5>  Macroeconomy </H5>
  There will be fluid and effective coordination between the 
government's economic team and the board of directors of the 
Bank of the Republic, faithfully respecting the commitments made 
to pursue macroconomic goals. This is the only way to avoid the 
sudden shocks that now jolt the economy, which are really 
disastrous for activities like construction. 
<H5>  Jobs </H5>
  The biggest challenge of the current development process is 
to find ways to help people who work peacefully and honestly. 
Financial and economic conditions will be created that will 
enable the development of more businesses, and consequently, the 
creation of more jobs. 
<H5>  Security </H5>
  The state will be strong in fundamental areas, that is, in 
the maintenance of public order and the campaign against crime 
and violence. There will be strong consumer protections, and 
abuses by monopolies will not be tolerated. 
<H5>  Economic Liberalization </H5>
  Savage capitalism is capitalism with public disorder, high 
inflation, macroeconomic imbalances, excessive competition, 
abuses by private and public monopolies, and closed markets. 
These problems are going to be eradicated. 
<H5>  Inflation </H5>
  To control the cost of living and avoid revaluation, the 
support of various social classes will be sought. He has made a 
commitment to remove economic indexing. 
  All administrative prices, including public service and 
utility rates, will be adjusted in line with inflation goals. 
The aim is to keep the sacrifices incurred in reducing inflation 
from striking wage earners or vulnerable population groups. 
<H5>  Government Spending </H5>
  Revaluation will be halted by measures to control inflation 
and public spending. This policy has not been carried out by the 
current administration, and in Pastrana's opinion, the liberal 
candidate has not advocated such a policy. Government spending 
will concentrate on areas like education, clean water supply 
systems, health care, road modernization, and environmental 
protection.

100 km west of Quito, and which did not cause personal injuries, 
has been the main incident of the legislative and gubernatorial 
elections being held today in Ecuador. Quito radio stations that 
reported the attack added the bomb did not cause substantial 
damage in the building where it was placed, and no information 
was known about the perpetrators. 
  There were two false bomb threats at polling stations in the 
capital, and in Esmeraldas, a city on the Pacific Coast, three 
people were injured in an incident between political 
adversaries, according to a television network. 
  No incidents have been registered throughout the rest of 
this 
Andean country of 11 million people except for delays in the 
opening of polling stations due to the late arrival of electoral 
officials, the lack of voting material, and similar cases. 
According to information from local media, voter turnout was low 
during the morning hours, and in certain places voting had not 
started two hours after the beginning of the elections.

  [Text] Quito, 1 May (DPA) -- President Sixto Duran-Ballen's 
liberal government, which will reportedly be defeated in today's 
elections in Ecuador, has announced its willingness to "work and 
cooperate" with the new Congress, in which opinion polls predict 
the opposition will enjoy an ample majority. "We want 
cooperation, not confrontation," Carlos Larreategui, the 
government's secretary general, said while reporting that 
everything was calm in the country during the election in which 
6.2 million voters will elect 65 of the 77 Congress members. 
  No incidents have been reported during the election, which 
began at 0700 local (1200 GMT) at 15,870 polling stations 
throughout the country's 21 provinces. Nevertheless, military 
forces are keeping watch at strategic locations, as stipulated 
by the Electoral Law, which also forbids the sale of alcoholic 
beverages. 
  "This is calm, not indifference," Jaime Nebot, former 
presidential candidate for the Social Christian Party, said. 
"Those who talk about indifference do so because they have not 
seen the excitement of the party's campaign," he added. 
  According to opinion polls, the Social Christian Party will 
be the overwhelming winners in the election. The party is 
expected to win at least one-third of the seats for which the 
country's 17 parties are competing. The government is expected 
to be the great loser, receiving less than 10 percent of the 
seats in the new Congress to be installed on 10 August. 
Nevertheless, it is possible that the ideological affinity 
between the government and the Social Christian Party, parties 
separated by personal rather than ideological disagreements, 
will allow implementation of the government's economic opening 
program despite the government's minority in Congress.

  [Text] Quito, 1 May (DPA) -- Official results have confirm 
the victory of the rightist Social Christian Party [PSC], which 
obtained approximately 38 percent of the total vote and 
one-third of the 65 deputy seats up for election in Ecuador 
today. 
  Thus, the PSC shed the regional nature that has 
characterized 
it as a coastal organization and became the leading national 
force by winning the election in more than 10 provinces spread 
throughout the country's four natural regions. This victory 
leaves 47-year-old Jaime Nebot, the PSC presidential candidate, 
as the front-runner for the presidency in 1996. 
  Nebot said the PSC faction in the unicameral Congress will 
demand changes from President Sixto Duran-Ballen's liberal 
government and will strive from the opposition to see that "the 
poor Ecuadorean is taken care of." The official vote count 
confirmed both the popularity of the right coalesced in the 
Roldosista Party as the country's second leading force and the 
weakening of the traditionally strong center-left Democratic 
Left and Popular Democracy parties. 
  According to official figures, the surprise of the election 
was the reemergence of the Maoist influenced Popular Democratic 
Movement as the country's third strongest political force and 
the leftist populism represented by Popular Revolutionary 
Action. The rest of the Marxist leftist parties have been 
virtually extinguished. 
  All of the political parties that obtained seats in Congress 
have announced they will continue to oppose the government. At 
the same time, however, they will try to improve the image of 
Congress, whose popularity has reached an all-time low as a 
result of the inactivity in the past two years. 
  The period of Congress sessions during which the new 
deputies 
will be sworn in will open on 10 August. On that same day, 
liberal President Duran-Ballen will begin the final two years of 
his term with no possibility for reelection. 
  Although the government received more support in the 
elections than predicted by opinion polls, it will have to face 
a hostile Congress for the rest of the term. 
  In this last stage, the government will try to implement its 
plan for economic opening and to privatize public corporations 
regarded as inefficient and unproductive, an action the PSC will 
surely support despite its avowed opposition.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Sixto Duran-Ballen on </F>
legislative and municipal elections with unidentified reporters 
at the Presidency on 1 May; broadcast in progress -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Duran-Ballen] For the time being, we have a bloc of 
eight deputies, but we will confirm this in a few hours when we 
have the results of today's democratic exercise. Even if we add 
the remaining deputies to that figure, the number is lower than 
we have had as far back as 1992. But the number of our deputies 
has not been reduced to the extent reported in the country. The 
attitude of the 15 other parties has not been to go to Congress 
to make specific proposals. No. Their only goal has been to 
oppose the current government. They have not presented any 
proposals nor have they been constructive. They were bent on 
destroying the government's image. The fact that we have the 
number of deputies you people say we will have, although we did 
not elect even one deputy in some provinces, the two lists 
constitute substantial proof of support. That means that the 
people in general, the majority within the center-right option, 
favor changes like restructuring the economy, changing the 
political stand, and creating more jobs. The people have seen 
that this is what my government has been doing. 
  [Reporter] What can you say about today's political victory, 
Mr. President, considering that, as you say, there has been 
[words indistinct]? 
  [Duran-Ballen] We cannot talk about a political victory or 
say that the opposition has won. There is an anticipated 
result, which will depend on the spirit with which the deputies 
will work at the National Congress and in the provincial and 
canton councils over the next two years. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, you say that all parties have 
banded together to campaign against the government. There is no 
doubt that the number of votes received by the government 
parties represents a rejection of the government's policy. It 
seems that not all the people are aware of what your government 
is doing. 
  [Duran-Ballen] Well, I cannot expect uniform acceptance by 
the Ecuadoran people. If I asked any one of you whether my work 
as mayor of Quito was positive, you would probably say yes. 
Well, this very same thing has happened to me halfway through 
my term. There has been a reaction. The people could not see 
the purpose of planning and the administrative and financial 
reorganization of Quito municipality. I had the same reaction 
to the government in general. 
  [Reporter] The majority of the next Congress will be in the 
opposition [words indistinct]. 
  [Duran-Ballen] No. The people are aware that the only goal 
of 
the parties in Congress has been to oppose the government's 
work. At some time, not only the Social Christian Party has 
cooperated with the government. Several deputies have supported 
government proposals because they found them reasonable and were 
convinced that the country urgently required these proposals to 
advance. 
  [Reporter] Do you expect a similar stand now that a letter 
of 
intent has been sent to Congress so the obligation with the IMF 
can be paid? 
  [Duran-Ballen] I would not talk about an obligation with the 
IMF. I would talk about commitments with the country, 
commitments we have told the IMF that we would try to fulfill. 
It is worth clarifying, however, that the IMF has not set 
terms. Quite the opposite is true. I have explained this a 
number of times. Any country's letter of intent to the IMF 
represents a pledge by the country to solve its economic 
problems in the near future. Consequently, there are no 
impositions other than those that we have placed on ourselves. 
  [Reporter] Will the government be able to do all that has 
been planned? 
  [Duran-Ballen] Regarding the aspects that depend solely on 
the executive branch, we will continue to do everything we had 
in mind, just as we have been doing. [words indistinct] 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, there is no doubt that the number 
of votes received by the government parties is disappointing. 
What do you think has been your worst mistake in these two 
years? Do you think it should be corrected in the remaining two 
years of your term? 
  [Duran-Ballen] I would not describe those actions as 
mistakes 
but rather as an outside assessment of what we have done. The 
country, including my fellow party members, and the media 
expected the economic situation we received to be corrected. We 
have made decisions to keep the number of bureaucrats low. This 
decision, not only to keep the number from rising but to reduce 
it, had never been made before. That is a positive step for the 
country. The economic reorganization we have been implementing 
is already yielding results. Consequently, a number of loans 
will be signed with the World Bank and Inter-American 
Development Bank in a few months. Some loans have already been 
signed with the Governments of Argentina, Brazil, Taiwan, and 
the Andean Development Corporation. All of these loans without 
exception are for development, exclusively to be invested in 
projects and services that mean recovery for the country. None 
of these loans is for administrative expenditures. The only way 
we could have achieved these things is by doing what we have 
been doing in these [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] You said no tangible results have been achieved 
in 
the first two years. 
  [Duran-Ballen] There are tangible results. 
  [Reporter] But not tangible enough. 
  [Duran-Ballen] I invite you to take any aspect and compare 
what my government has done with what previous governments did. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Duran-Ballen] Let us consider the current road construction 
and maintenance programs. Tell me if the number of kilometers of 
highways in 1988 through 1990 is comparable to the present 
number. I am asking you to dig out the figures. You have to 
have the figures to make an accurate assessment. 
  [Reporter] My question is specific, Mr. President. What can 
the Ecuadoran people expect considering that you explained 
[words indistinct]? What will those results be? 
  [Duran-Ballen] In these first years, we have been 
reorganizing the economy and reducing the number of government 
employees. As a result, we have access to international loans 
from institutions and countries. We can move greater internal 
resources and devote all of them to our economic development. 
  [Reporter] What exactly can the people expect from the 
government? 
  [Duran-Ballen] I would like to invite you or any one of the 
people here to come with me and tour the construction programs, 
not necessarily of this government, and tell me whether this 
reorganization has not had good results. Tell me if there are no 
additional jobs, which we intended. There has been an opening to 
international trade, and exports have increased. 
  [Reporter] It has been said that inflation goes down but 
that 
prices go up. It is said the number of jobs has increased but 
that there are no jobs. 
  [Duran-Ballen] How can you say there are no jobs? Who is 
building the highways? Who is working on the various programs 
in the provinces? I repeat: Let us compare any two years of 
any of the previous governments with the first two years of my 
government. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, how can you .... 
  [Duran-Ballen, interrupting] If there are fewer projects, 
then I would agree with you that there are fewer jobs. 
  [Reporter] Have more jobs been created? 
  [Duran-Ballen] Of course, many more jobs have been created, 
but there are fewer jobs in the public sector. I refuse and 
will continue to refuse to consider the public sector as the 
only source of employment in the country, as reporters seem to 
believe. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, you have been talking about the 
government's work. How do you interpret the inconsistency 
between what the people think, what has been expressed against 
the government today, and what you say? Unfortunately, you seem 
to speak a different language than the people. Is your 
government completely impossible to understand? 
  [Duran-Ballen] I shall go back to the time when I was mayor 
of Quito. For the first months, the first year of the first two 
years, everyone said the same thing. When I started to 
reorganize the real estate registry and charge fees, which had 
not been collected before, when we started to outline a rational 
plan to pave streets, establish services, and extend electrical 
energy, no one saw or believed. There was a reaction. Now, if 
I ask you -- unless you do not reside in Quito -- you would say 
the projects carried out in Quito were many and real. 
Otherwise, I am saying something different from the truth and 
deceiving the people.

  [Text] Edgard Ponce, president of the United Workers Front 
(FUT), said the government must change its policy or the 
demonstrations and protest strikes will continue to grow. 
Workers and peasants are unwilling to allow privatization of 
the Ecuadorean Social Security Institute, the state-owned 
telecommunications company, and the Ecuadorean Institute of 
Electrification. The FUT reiterated that the workers will take 
even more radical action if the government persists in its 
maniacal fervor to privatize state-run companies. 
  The FUT president added that joint action by the FUT, the 
public sector, the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of 
Ecuador, teachers, craftsmen, small merchants, and other sectors 
would have serious repercussions that the government can only 
prevent if it stops hijacking profitable state-run companies to 
give them away to private businessmen.

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy responded to 
expressions of support from Colorado Party members from the 
interior of our country, who were in his office this morning. 
The president said he would guarantee the strike scheduled for 
2 May. 
  During an open meeting at Lopez Palace, the presidents of 
the 
San Pedro, Caaguazu, Misiones, and Central Colorado Party 
precincts asked the president for Education Minister Nicanor 
Duarte Frutos' head. Colorado Party mayors and governors were 
also present. 
  The Colorado Party leaders, including the controversial 
Emiliano Garcia, who allegedly was the leader of a mob involved 
in the attack against Congress [on 7 October 1993, to protest 
the approval of a bill banning military people from becoming 
involved in partisan politics], placed themselves at Wasmosy's 
disposal for the 2 May strike. 
  The Colorado Party leaders said they were willing to 
mobilize 
if the president so orders. They even used indecent terms, 
involving sexual positions, to describe their unconditional 
willingness. Santani Colorado Party leader Victor Quintana 
literally said: We are putting ourselves on all fours before 
you. The Colorado Party grassroots leaders also asked the 
executive branch for more assistance and the ability to appoint 
and remove officials. 
  In response, Wasmosy began his speech by furiously attacking 
the press. Concerning the strike, he said it has political 
grounds. Wasmosy added: We will demonstrate that we can remain 
calm. He also indicated that they were teasing a tiger, and 
that the government would not be weak in its actions. 
  [Begin Wasmosy recording] I can guarantee you that we will 
act firmly and abiding by the law. We will protect those 
joining the strike because they have a right to strike. 
Nevertheless, they have no right to prevent other people from 
working, as do those professors, teachers, and movements 
disguised as democratic that tell the students: Do not come to 
school on 2 May because it will be dangerous, or because there 
will be no transportation. These people are insincere 
democrats. The Colorado Party is democratic. 
  Tell me if there is one journalist here who has been 
harassed, if one medium has been harassed, or if one person with 
a different political leaning has been harassed. They say what 
they please, and even what they should not, every day from 0600 
onwards. Nevertheless, the Colorado Party is great, and it will 
always emerge a victor. 
  Gentlemen, we should actually take into account what has 
been 
raised here: a firm organization, with republican bases and 
principles, an unequaled nationalist, agrarian, and republican 
party. Nevertheless, we have been branded as having implemented 
neoliberal policies, with being absolutists, when the party 
actually takes the people into account, created solutions, and 
proven itself. [end recording]

  [Text] Lima, 29 Apr (EFE) -- Today, Peru rejected a U.S. 
State Department statement on the alleged slaughter of civilians 
in the Peruvian jungle, and described the U.S. report as 
"unfriendly, inaccurate, and inappropriate." The Peruvian 
Foreign Ministry has announced that, in the absence of U.S. 
Ambassador Alvin Adams, it had summoned U.S. Charge d'Affaires 
Charles Brayshaw to personally convey the Peruvian Government's 
"strong protest" over this issue to him. 
  On 28 April, State Department spokesperson Christine Shelly 
told reporters that the U.S. Government is concerned about 
"recent reports of the murder of civilians by Peruvian military 
forces in Huanuco Department, in the central Peruvian region." 
Shelly added that U.S. Government officials have asked Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori "to allow Red Cross personnel into 
the area where the massacre allegedly took place to determine 
the number of civilians murdered." 
  The Peruvian Foreign Ministry states in its communique that 
Brayshaw was informed that "relations and agreements between 
Peru and the International Red Cross Committee exclusively 
concern the two parties. Thus, Peru will not accept any 
interference from third parties in these matters." 
  After stating that Peru respects the independence of the Red 
Cross, the communique notes that it is "inappropriate" for the 
United States "to attempt to mediate in this case without having 
received any mandate from the Red Cross," and notes that "this 
kind of action may undermine the degree of autonomy the 
organization should have." 
  The communique finally states that Peru considers it 
important to maintain a good level of relations with all 
friendly countries, "but it cannot accept that the struggle the 
Peruvian people are waging against terrorism be treated lightly, 
let alone be the subject of unsubstantiated prejudgments." 
  The Peruvian Foreign Ministry was thus referring to the 
sources from which the State Department obtained its 
information, namely the National Human Rights Coordinating Board 
and a sector of the press, which have charged the military with 
having bombed some townships during "Operation Aries," which 
began on 5 April. 
  The National Human Rights Coordinating Board retracted its 
charges later and admitted that no bombings had taken place, but 
it insisted on charging that urban areas had been hit by mortar 
fire and that some people were murdered by soldiers. Later, the 
Congressional Human Rights Committee and media organizations 
reported that there are no townships in the area of conflict, 
which is located on the left bank of the Huallaga River, but 
rather it is a stronghold of Shining Path terrorists. 
  The congressional committee found the remains of several 
humans and asked the attorney general to investigate the death 
of those people. This task has been entrusted to a special 
prosecutor in the Tingo Maria Province, which has jurisdiction 
over the Huallaga zone.

  [Text] Lima, 28 Apr (EFE) -- The Peruvian police guarantee 
that the Shining Path [SL] terrorist group has split. In a 
report released today by the Counterterrorism Directorate, the 
police speculate on the possibility of a clash between the two 
factions into which the group has allegedly split. 
  The report states that the leaders who support peace -- 
which 
government officials believe is led by Abimael Guzman, the SL 
founder and leader -- have been expelled. The other faction 
does not regard him as a leader -- although it recognizes him as 
"ideologist" -- because he "does not address (the party or the 
war) from jail." 
  Government officials believe the faction that does not 
accept 
Guzman's leadership believes the alleged peace proposal is not 
genuine, they consider it a government "hoax." 
  The police report points out that the group split after the 
establishment -- under the leadership of Oscar Ramirez Durand, 
alias "Feliciano" -- of a new central committee in March in the 
Huanta Province mountains. This new central committee agreed to 
pursue the war that began in 1980. 
  The police report states that this group described the 
members of the central committee allegedly headed by Guzman as 
"debased people, traitors, weaklings, and old revisionists." 
  Government officials state that the rejoinder issued by 
Guzman's loyal followers was disclosed in a communique also 
dated March. In this communique, Guzman's loyal followers 
charge the rebels with feigning loyalty to their leader and with 
"undermining the party" over "personal and opportunist 
ambitions." 
  Therefore, the police believe "the internal dispute has 
entered the elimination phase and a settlement of accounts has 
not been ruled out."

expert in Peruvian terrorist violence, stressed the split in the 
Shining Path is what confirms this Maoist group's "total 
defeat." The expert indicated that the split in this group, 
which took up arms in 1980, has been demonstrated by Shining 
Path documents, some of which have been delivered to Peruvian 
media. 
  The expert noted that according to these documents the 
faction headed by Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman supports 
Guzman's peace talks with the government, whereas another 
faction rejects them and declares it will pursue the Shining 
Path war against Peruvian democracy. 
  Gonzalez said Shining Path had experienced hard military 
blows in the past two years, after Guzman's capture, "but was 
able to resist and remain active thanks to its main political 
capital, namely party unity." The expert emphasized: "The 
Shining Path was monolithic while it kept this unity. Therefore, 
the Shining Path split, from a political viewpoint, may be 
comparable to Guzman's capture from a military viewpoint." He 
added: "The organization created by Abimael Guzman has not been 
entirely quashed. Nevertheless, after its split, Shining Path 
has experienced its worst political reversal and is going 
through a situation of overall defeat." 
  Today, the opposition newspaper LA REPUBLICA published a 
police report that confirms the group's split. The newspaper 
reports that the faction opposing Guzman held a meeting in March 
in the Huanta Province mountains in southern Peru. During the 
meeting, this faction agreed to disregard Guzman's peace 
proposal. 
  The report also indicates that during this meeting a new 
Shining Path "central committee" was formed, and that this 
"central committee" expelled from the party the leaders who 
remain loyal to Guzman and who support peace, describing them as 
"traitors, infiltrated people, capitulators, and old 
revisionists." According to the report, the new "committee" is 
headed by Shining Path leader Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias 
"Comrade Feliciano," one of the Shining Path founders. 
  Today, former Deputy Carlos Tapia, another expert in Shining 
Path activities, stressed that "Shining Path no longer 
represents a threat, and in a way we may coexist with this type 
of violence as is the case with the IRA [Irish Republican Army] 
in Ireland and the ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] in Spain." 
Nevertheless, Tapia ruled out the possibility of the terrorist 
organization's immediate disappearance, "as the social processes 
that have been brewing for so long may not end overnight, and 
some time is required for their extinction."

<F P=106> [Report by Jacqueline Aponte] </F>
  [Text] Private enterprise has reacted favorably to the 
presentation of the government's economic program, which 
includes something new: 10 percent of PDVSA [Petroleos de 
Venezuela, S.A.] and CVG [Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana] 
shares will be transferred to workers as a way of paying social 
benefits owed to them and at the same time opening basic 
industries to private, local, and foreign investment. 
  Asked about the matter, Jorge Redmond, president of the 
Confederation of Venezuelan Chambers and Associations of 
Industrialists [Conindustria], said the reaction was "positive." 
He remarked, however, that the event was not truly the 
presentation of an economic program but rather a philosophical 
orientation on economy. 
  He said that the unusual thing about the event was the use 
of 
a new method to solve the problem posed by the need to reduce 
the number of public employees. He added that the unusual method 
of using PDVSA and CVG shares to pay benefits offers two 
positive advantages: It helps reduce the payroll, inflation, and 
interest rates, and stimulates the economy. 
  Redmond described as "resourceful and commendable" the 
government suggesting, at the presentation of its economic 
program, an adjustment in the social benefits system to restore 
the people's lost purchasing power. He also said that this is an 
indication of President Rafael Caldera's interest in changing 
the populist ideas presented during his campaign, such as 
keeping gasoline prices at the current level and continuing with 
the same social benefits program. 
  According to Berend Roosen, president of the National 
Council 
for Commerce and Services [Consecomercio], what the government 
presented on Wednesday is only the backbone of an economic 
program and that, for this reason, many things were neither said 
nor explained. "Nevertheless, we were happy to hear talk about 
opening the oil industry and the CVG to outside capital and the 
transfer of shares of these enterprises to the workers. 
Evidently, we are speaking a very similar language." 
  Roosen added that the government is beginning to understand 
that the state's labor obligations are very high. The government 
wants to relieve the pressure on the health and education 
sectors through decentralization. The formula presented 
yesterday will serve to transfer the services without 
obligations, as the governors had been demanding. 
  As for the transfer of 10 percent of PDVSA and CVG shares, 
Roosen said it still remains to determine how this decision will 
be implemented because PDVSA as such cannot transfer its shares. 
Nevertheless, the enterprise could do it through its 
subsidiaries, which have been set up as corporations and can 
register their shares on the stock market.

  [Text] The Pro-Venezuela Association [Asociacion 
Pro-Venezuela] Board of Directors expressed its full support 
today for the executive branch regarding implementation of the 
economic and social readjustment plan. The board of directors of 
the Pro-Venezuela Association, a Venezuelan nationalistic 
organization presided over by former Presidency Secretary Ramon 
Espinoza, expressed its solidarity during a visit to President 
Rafael Caldera at Miraflores Palace. 
  In statements to reporter Vicente Briceno, Espinoza said 
cited the adopted measures will resolve the economic crisis. 
  [Begin Espinoza recording] Regarding these policies, we 
simply suggested it was convenient to pay part of the internal 
debt with the private sector and certain public entities, other 
than the Central Bank, with funds from privatization; this would 
free up 40 percent of the budget appropriation destined to make 
interest payments on the debt. In monetary terms, this 
represents approximately 140 billion bolivares, which could be 
earmarked for social spending in 1995, and to fill the gap left 
over by the tax on bank debits, which will cease to exist on 30 
December 1994. 
  We are calling for the need to revise monetary and financial 
policy, particularly regarding interest rates. It is impossible 
to reactivate the production sector and bring new investments 
with such high interest rates. 
  We also suggested it is convenient to redirect the problem 
of 
foreign currency to purchase capital and intermediate goods and 
[words indistinct] for production, so we can reactivate the 
production apparatus. If we are unable to reactivate the 
production apparatus, it would be difficult for banks in general 
and the financial sector to recover their capacity for 
intermediation and recover their condition as strong 
institutions to finance significant projects. [end recording]

  [Text] Accion Democratica [Democratic Action] and the COPEI 
[Social Christian Party] have expressed their support for state 
governors who are seeking amendments to the Law on the Election 
and Removal of Governors. They believe that the Supreme Court of 
Justice should be the body charged with removing elected 
governors for well-considered reasons. 
  This statement of position was made by the leaders of each 
of 
these political parties who met separately with the Board of 
Directors of the Association of Governors of Venezuela, presided 
over by Henrique Salas Romer, governor of the State of Carabobo; 
Francisco Ron Sandoval, governor of the State of Tachira; Carlos 
Tablante, governor of the State of Aragua; and Arnaldo Arocha, 
governor of the State of Miranda. 
  Salas Romer indicated that the meetings were very 
encouraging 
and that there was substantial, mutual support by the governors 
for each other. In principle, by continuing the process of 
political conversations at the highest level the 
irresponsibility which has been reflected in some legislative 
assemblies will be discouraged as well as the pressures which 
have been applied to political parties to come out against 
elected, regional governors, without serious reasons for doing 
that. 
  He said that the governors were satisfied that there is 
every 
intention to support a proposal for an amendment of this law as 
a matter of some urgency, "which would not make it impossible 
for legislative assemblies to remove a governor for serious 
reasons but which would set out the conditions under which this 
might be done." 
  He emphasized that the fundamental point of reference of any 
democratic system should be maintained, that is, that only the 
people can remove a person who has been elected by the people's 
will, unless a sufficiently serious situation should arise and 
the courts intervene to condemn a person involved in 
misappropriation of funds or any other wrongful act affecting 
public resources. Luis Alfaro Ucero, secretary general of 
Democratic Action, indicated that his party may propose an 
amendment to the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors 
because he believes that this is a very serious problem. This is 
a view which he shares with the national leadership of 
Democratic Action. 
  We should consider the idea that removing a governor should 
not be done for merely circumstantial reasons, or on the basis 
of considerations which are political in character. Rather, a 
step of this kind must be very well supported and must have been 
studied and analyzed with the greatest seriousness. We must try 
to think more of the national interest, rather than the private 
interests of the political parties. 
  He pointed out that if it is constitutionally possible to 
amend the law, we, for our part, will cooperate, and with 
pleasure, in that sense. 
  At the offices of the Social Christian Party the delegation 
from the Association of State Governors of Venezuela was 
received by Jose Curiel, the secretary general, and by Orlando 
Contreras Pulido, the deputy secretary general. Curiel indicated 
that in the view of the Social Christian Party it is very 
important to bring stability to the Venezuelan political system. 
It is not good for the country to have a situation like the 
present one in which, with a political majority and for reasons 
of only secondary importance, a governor may be removed from 
office. 
  Curiel added: "It is necessary to provide stability to the 
political system and amend the Law on the Election and Removal 
of Governors in a legal way in order to achieve that objective. 
If there is a serious situation affecting a state governor, this 
matter could be raised before the Supreme Court of Justice."

<F P=106> [Article by Abraham Rivero Perez] </F>
  [Text] While the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS), headed by 
Senator Freddy Munoz, supported the proposal by Henrique Salas 
Romer, the governor of the State of Carabobo, concerning 
amendments to the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors, 
Jose Miguel Uzcategui, the coordinator of Convergencia 
[Convergence Movement], did not state his position. However, he 
said that in the next few days he will review the situation with 
the national leadership of Convergencia. 
  At a meeting held with Freddy Munoz, the MAS leader, 
Henrique 
Salas Romer, the governor of the State of Carabobo, repeated his 
concern about the removal from office of Edgar Sayago and Ovidio 
Gonzalez. He added that amending the Law on the Election and 
Removal of Governors is an urgent matter, since the "spectacle" 
of dismissing a state governor, in addition to cheapening the 
will of the people and deepening the feeling that there is a 
power vacuum, harms the prestige of the process of 
decentralization. 
  Freddy Munoz, the secretary general of the MAS, stated that 
the removals of governors from office are "a sign of insanity, a 
sign of political machinations, a sign of illegitimacy" which 
should be ended. He added that his party would be actively 
engaged in preventing "the perversion of the democratic spirit" 
and in amending the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors. 
  Salas Romer said: "The juridical foundations are solid 
enough, and our proposals to all political parties have been 
aimed at reaching agreement on a partial amendment of the Law on 
the Election and Removal of Governors. Therefore, the necessary 
constitutional urgency has arisen to place a more certain 
juridical framework around the exercise of the functions for 
which we were elected." On the other hand Deputy Jose Miguel 
Uzcategui stated that, although the amendment of the Law on the 
Election and Removal of Governments is important, his party will 
decide what to do "to prevent more elements of uncertainty from 
being introduced in connection with regional governments." 
Although he recognized that he has a favorable opinion of Salas 
Romer, he stated that he could give no guarantees regarding the 
approval of his "Memorandum of Accounts," since it should be 
reviewed and discussed with regional legislators. Salas Romer 
stated that if a political agreement is reached with all of the 
political parties, in a short time it will be easy to develop a 
legally acceptable way of helping the governors to manage their 
affairs on behalf of the people, without doing damage to the 
power of the legislative assemblies, given the fact that their 
functions "are important in watching over and checking on the 
performance of the governor." 
  Salas Romer, as well as Jesus Rondon Nucete, governor of the 
State of Merida, reviewed with the Committee on Regional 
Development the political crisis caused by the latest removals 
of state governors, agreeing that "there should be a 
relationship of cause and effect in the removal of governors 
from office." 
  The provision of a referendum for removing governors 
appeared 
to be a practical alternative, both for the governors as well as 
for the legislative assemblies. Despite the fact that Salas 
Romer has his reservations about the percentage of the vote to 
be required in such a case, Rondon Nucete, the governor of the 
State of Merida, indicated that it would be enough to add to the 
Law on the Election and Removal of Governors a "democratic 
standard" to regulate the referendum.

<F P=106> [Report by Martha Eugenia Davila in Tijuana from the "Early </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] Violence and insecurity unfortunately continue here 
in the city of Tijuana. Federico Benitez Lopez, director of the 
Tijuana Municipal Police, was killed last night in an attack. 
  According to preliminary reports, an anonymous call was 
received at 2000 at the Tijuana Public Security Directorate, 
which was headed up by Benitez Lopez. The phone call warned that 
a bomb had been planted at the Tijuana airport. Municipal 
police officers, led by Benitez Lopez himself, went to the 
airport. After a fruitless search for the bomb, the police 
officers left the airport via the airport road. While stopped 
at an intersection known as Puente Tijuana, Federico Benitez and 
his bodyguard Ramon Alarid, who were traveling in a white pickup 
owned by Tijuana Municipality, were ambushed by and fired on 
from a dark red Bronco pickup with tinted glass windows. This 
vehicle was later abandoned at the Murua (?parking lot) in this 
same city. 
  Policemen were deployed in large numbers after this 
unfortunate incident. Members of the Federal Judicial Police, 
State Judicial Police, Municipal Police, and national security 
forces were deployed. Federico Benitez was taken to a Red Cross 
Hospital. He had two bullet wounds, one in the head and the 
other in the neck. Despite efforts to save his life, Federico 
Benitez died at 2215. His bodyguard Ramon Alarid had died 
instantly. 
  Surveillance of the area was ordered. All exits from 
Tijuana, the most visited city in the world, were also placed 
under surveillance. This operation continued throughout the 
night and continues this morning. 
  Apparently, a medical report was going to be released, but 
this was postponed. We are waiting for more information. In an 
interview, Jorge Alvarez, commander of the 2d Sector of the 
State Judicial Police, and Captain Jose Luis Lopez, of the same 
police department, agreed the ambush had been carefully planned. 
  This situation has created anxiety among the population. 
This is one of the unfortunate incidents that has infuriated 
the people of Tijuana, Baja California, and the entire nation.

<F P=106> [Statements by Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe during </F>
celebration of the 50th Anniversary of Banco de Oriente in 
Puebla on 22 April; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] I would like to take advantage of this occasion to 
make a few comments on the current economic situation. As we 
have said, the painful and regrettable events that Mexico has 
experienced in the first quarter of this year -- in addition to 
its tragic human dimension -- have generated effects on the 
nation's economy in general and on the financial markets in 
particular. 
  The financial markets reflect these temporary or transitory 
events however. It is important to acknowledge that these have 
been adjusting in a disorderly [as heard] fashion. This orderly 
adjustment, within a legal framework, demonstrates that our 
markets are much more stable than in the past, much more mature 
than in the past. It also demonstrates we have more solid 
financial institutions than in the past, that we maintain an 
unchanging economic policy that does not vary with passing 
incidents, rather it maintains its course, steered by its 
guidelines. We also have a much healthier and more stable 
economy. 
  This transparent adjustment has occurred in an economy that 
is completely different from the past. Currently we have an 
economy that is much more open to outside markets, more 
diversified, which, together with the financial sector, has 
allowed us to absorb these events. 
  I would like to simply point out some of the important 
changes that have taken place and that are reflected in the 
consensus of the agreement that we recently ratified. The 
government, within the agreement, must comply with its 
commitments. For example, it must not have a fiscal deficit in 
keeping with Congress' mandate and it must maintain a cautious 
monetary policy. This can be achieved through the new Banco de 
Mexico, which has autonomy at the constitutional level and has 
as its main goal safeguarding the currency's purchasing power, 
that is, to keep inflation low. 
  Obviously, when faced with this temporary uncertainty, the 
markets, as I said, adjust to the circumstances. The temporary 
interest rate increases are the appropriate reply. 
Nevertheless, these rate increases are transitory and for the 
short term. You may recall some events in the past, and not the 
too distant past. You may recall for example, in March 1992 when 
interest rates started to fall there was uncertainty, the 
interest rates then started to climb, the exchange rate fell 
more than planned. At that time, it was said this could turn 
back the progress made. Nevertheless the course was maintained, 
there was calm, positions and guidelines were maintained. As a 
result, the interest rates went down again, the stock market 
also started to recover. 
  Do you recall a more recent event in October 1993, which was 
not long ago. Remember that at that time, there were external 
events; now there are internal and external events, as I said 
before. We had to adjust the markets at that time and you will 
recall that in October the interests rates rose; there was an 
adjustment in the stock market, however, and the course and the 
guidelines were maintained. There was no fiscal deficit; there 
was no more printing of currency, no more statements that 
inflation does not count. On the contrary, the course was 
maintained. In this way, as in all difficult times, such as 
those we are now overcoming and those that we will certainly 
have to overcome in the future, the guidelines, the course, the 
spirit, and renewed motivation must be clearly maintained. 
  Let us recall some important changes that have taken place 
in the past years. From an economy with sky-rocketing 
inflation, that averaged over 80 percent and that at times 
totalled 200 percent a few years ago, last year, our inflation 
rate was down to 8 percent. From March to March [years not 
specified] it was 7 percent, and from April to April, from May 
to May, we will continue reducing it. From an economy that had 
a public sector deficit of 17 percent of what we Mexicans 
produced in 1982, and 11 percent in 1988, we now have an economy 
that has no deficit or any surplus. 
  The government now only spends what it has, it does not 
overspend to subsequently tax the individuals with inflation. 
We do not spend more than we have. This is also a government 
-- one must recall because at times we forget -- for which 
barely 10 years ago 60 percent of its budget consisted of paying 
interest; 20 percent was disbursed in transfers to companies 
such as [name indistinct], and Metalmecanica, and so forth. The 
other 20 percent that remained was earmarked for education, 
health, and social security matters. 
  In our current budget, 56 percent is earmarked for 
education, 
health, potable water, sewers, ecology, and housing. We only 
earmark 10 percent of the transfers to the payment of interest; 
previously it was 60 percent of the budget. The rest is spent 
on basic support programs for the countryside, support for 
ecology, and so forth. 
  Let us take a look at these very important changes. From a 
government that spent on things and paid interest, we now have a 
government that spends on its people, on its community. Its 
largest disbursements are for fundamental matters such as 
education and health, to give the community better opportunities 
for education and thereby better opportunities to access the job 
market and for a decent life. 
  You can note the significant change from a totally protected 
economy that was overregulated with trade barriers to an open 
economy, with fewer regulations, and with a dynamic exporting 
sector. This is an economy in which only a few years ago 90 
percent of its exports was made up of petroleum. Last year, 87 
percent of our exports were not petroleum, they were 
nonpetroleum exports. This year, most certainly, given the 
dynamics in nonpetroleum exports, more than 90 percent of the 
exports will no longer be petroleum. This is an economy in 
which, during the first two months of this year, the dollar 
amount of nonpetroleum exports grew 28 percent. Nonpetroleum 
exports are growing 28 percent annually. The figures are the 
most dynamic in the Western Hemisphere. This is because the 
companies have been transformed to participate successfully in 
the international markets. 
  Undoubtedly, there is still a great deal to do, but we 
should 
not let any passing event make us doubt the strength we Mexicans 
have to develop. It certainly is not time to change course. It 
is time to advance unitedly, with courage, and with conviction 
toward a future that will certainly be more prosperous and more 
just. Let us not become discouraged for any reason. In the 
past, we have overcome problems, we are currently doing this, we 
will overcome them again in the future when they arise. 
  Mexico has a guideline, it has leadership, and a course. 
Mexico has a first-class work force, it has businessmen who 
have demonstrated their courage, their valor to risk their 
capital. Today, we commemorate this at the Banco de Oriente, in 
these times of reforms and changes, so we can have stronger 
companies, better jobs, better projects that benefit Puebla, 
Tlaxcala, the region, and Mexico. I congratulate all of you 
bank shareholders, advisers, and employees. You are truly a 
source of pride for the state, for the region, and it must also 
be said that men and women such as you, who risk your capital 
and who generate jobs, are a source of pride for Mexico. Thank 
you very much.

  [Text] The Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] expanded 
secretariat meeting is being held with the participation of the 
general secretaries of the unions and the provincial CTC 
branches. The meeting is discussing aspects of the issues to be 
analyzed by the National Assembly of the People's Government 
[ANPP] session, the current situation of the harvest, and May 
Day activities. 
  The reports read in the meeting make evident the willingness 
of the workers to again pick up the analysis of the problems 
brought up at the workers assemblies and continue to monitor 
closely indexes such as profitability, costs, and use of 
resources. Likewise, it was announced that a process of 
assemblies for economic efficiency will begin on 15 May. 
Positive results can already be seen in this regard if we keep 
in mind that there is a significant drop in absenteeism and 
issuance of medical certificates. This means -- a participant 
stressed -- that our workers have internalized the issue. 
  There was a special briefing by Sugar Industry Minister 
Nelson Torres who said that the sugarcane harvest has been 
significantly affected by the rains and that this requires a 
greater effort by the manual cutting brigades, as well as the 
combines teams. Torres added that earnest mobilized workers, who 
are now tackling sugarcane weeding and planting efforts, are 
joining in this struggle.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the </F>
Cuban Workers Federation, by unidentified reporter; place, date 
not given; from the "Evening Information Review" 
newscast--recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] We would like to hear about the Cuban 
Workers Federation's [CTC] expectations for the National 
Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] general assembly 
scheduled for 1 May. 
  [Ross] We cannot talk about expectations, because an 
expectation is something that is not yet defined, something what 
one wants but there is still uncertainty about it. We believe 
we will discuss at the assembly issues related to the present 
and future life of Cuban workers and the people in general. The 
discussions will be based specifically on the workers' point of 
view, workers' opinions, workers' proposals, workers' doubts, 
and their aspirations about what should and should not be done 
and what they believe is feasible and should be done. In this 
light, one cannot speak about expectations. We are talking 
about specific facts, because even before the assembly several 
decisions have been taken based on proposals the workers made. 
  We cannot expect one single assembly meeting to adopt all 
the 
measures needed to clean up the country's finances, to correct 
certain economic problems, and to define new policies. We 
expect the assembly to make recommendations to the government so 
the government can study them, and later implement them. These 
decisions will not only be the reflection of what we discussed 
with the workers at the parliament in the workplace sessions, 
but they will return to the workplace for further study. 
  This is what we expect to get out of the ANPP sessions. It 
will be a public session, and all the foreign guests at the 1 
May celebrations will be present. It will be broadcast on radio 
and television so our people and the whole world can hear what 
we are debating. 
  [Reporter] We would like to know how the workers movement 
has 
welcomed the decision to hold this long-awaited assembly on 1 
May. 
  [Ross] The Cuban workers movement greatly appreciates the 
revolutionary government's decision to adopt Comrade Fidel's 
proposal to hold this specific ANPP session to discuss such 
important issues on such a significant date as 1 May. In so 
doing, they will honor and express respect for Cuban workers. 
  [Reporter] One last question. Radio Havana Cuba is 
celebrating its 33d anniversary on 1 May. What has Radio Havana 
Cuba meant to the world's union movement? 
  [Ross] Radio Havana Cuba is the vehicle by which we maintain 
contact with the workers of the world, as far as the radio 
signal of this Cuban radio station can travel. Radio Havana 
Cuba has allowed us to express our beliefs, our truth, and our 
information. Radio Havana Cuba has been a bridge and a channel 
that has shortened distances to keep us united with the other 
union movements in Latin America over the shortwaves bands. We 
would like to congratulate all the workers, technicians, 
journalists, support personnel, leaders, labor organizations, 
political organizations, and, in general, all of the workers of 
this prestigious Cuban radio station on this 33d anniversary.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio by </F>
unidentified reporters at the Presidential Palace in Guatemala 
City; from the "Telepress" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] We are working on that. The negotiations are 
clear. We are highlighting not only the positive aspects of the 
bill, but also the aspects of what I call a corrective tax 
system. This is not simply a matter of laws, but of a series of 
administrative measures, the objectives of which I could outline 
as follows: the administrative reform of institutions to 
facilitate tax collection, the reform and modernization of the 
state to collect taxes efficiently, and the utilization of the 
required authority to effectively penalize tax evaders. 
  By doing this we are not only modernizing the state and 
finding solutions for situations -- such as locating necessary 
resources -- but also laying the groundwork for a functional tax 
system in this country. All sectors, Congress, and the 
taxpayers can see that this government is unquestionably taking 
corrective measures. In my presidential tours, I am allocating 
resources to those areas in which they need to be allocated, and 
I am not funneling them into the pockets of government 
officials. The president has demonstrated that he is not 
engaged in illegal activities or breaking the law to get rich. 
  The resources -- 28 percent of them -- are being invested, 
and this is why I can rightly and with moral authority ask the 
various sectors to pay their taxes, because the salvation of 
Guatemala is everybody's duty, and because when one person 
cooperates, he is cooperating not with the president alone, but 
with the entire country. In this way, we can allocate resources 
to health care, education, road work, and security. I trust 
Congress will pass a bill that definitely will not hurt the 
people, because we are simply talking about a modification -- 
about only one additional tax -- and it only involves 4,000 
enterprises out of the hundreds of thousands that exist, as well 
as 150 individuals. This tax does not affect any person or 
company whose income is less than 500,000 quetzals. 
  We are asking those enterprises effected for their concerted 
effort, support, and cooperation at this time. The tax on these 
businesses will be in effect only once. Many businesses in this 
group have already given their approval, because they know that 
resources are necessary now to make social investments. I trust 
we will be able to clean up the country's finances in order to 
face economic and social problems, considering that most 
institutional and political problems have been resolved. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, a deputy has charged that some 
funds have been transferred to the Presidency. 
  [De Leon] I thank you for the opportunity to flatly deny 
this 
deputy's assertions. We have to begin by asking who is Juan 
Carlos Simons, and what has he done as a deputy? [passage 
omitted] 
  The first thing I did when I became president was eliminate 
the Presidency's secret expenditures. In addition, a 
constitutional reform that is now in effect and that was passed 
on my initiative, constitutionally bans secret expenditures. 
From now on, no government organization will be able to get its 
hands on funds that serve to promote corruption. Regarding the 
deputy's charges that such expenditures exist and that funds 
have been transferred, this is completely false, and I demand 
that he support his charges with evidence. Otherwise, I will 
turn to proper legal measures. If there is one thing of which I 
am proud, it is my honesty and integrity. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- General Lazaro Avila Soleno, head of 
the Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff, has emphatically stated: 
"We have always respected the established command." 
  The second in command within the Honduran Armed Forces has 
responded briefly to the reporters' questions, presuming the 
Army commander in chief is the one who is authorized to speak. 
  Nevertheless, the reporters insisted on knowing his position 
on the new regulation that may be established for the 
recruitment of military personnel. 
  He has said all Hondurans must be aware of their 
responsibilities, regardless of their area of expertise. 
  He added that as members of the Armed Forces and as 
soldiers, 
the military is concerned about situations that may emerge at 
any moment and which might require the Army's support, "but the 
Armed Forces will always fulfill its institutional mission," he 
has said. 
  Avila has said no conditions have been established for 
acceptance of the proposal on educational and voluntary military 
service, because Honduras' top authorities will make the 
decision via Congress. He has said history will judge those who 
make the decision. 
  Avila has reiterated he could not express personal opinions 
out of respect for the mandates of the Constitution of the 
Republic and the highest authorities. 
  Regarding a possible weakening of the Armed Forces when the 
new recruitment model is implemented, Avila has said he could 
not predict the future, but he assured that the Army is a solid, 
constitutional, and permanent institution that is not in any 
danger. 
  Avilo trusts the legislative branch's decision will be the 
most advantageous, indeed the best for the country. 
  He has said there may be options if voluntary recruitment 
fails; "for every great crisis or problem there are great 
solutions," he has said. 
  Avila has said various options have been examined in depth: 
"We always examine in peacetime what may happen in a crisis," 
he has said.

<F P=106> [From the "Day to Day" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Given that the Change '94 Alliance [of presidential 
candidate Ruben Dario Carles] and presidential candidate Mireya 
Moscoso de Gruber, of the Arnulfist Party, failed to reach an 
agreement, the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] has announced in 
Chiriqui Province that it will not support either ticket in the 
8 May elections. 
  PDC presidential candidate Engineer Eduardo Vallarino 
pointed 
out that his political party had firm plans to renounce his 
candidacy, however, a lack of understanding prevented it. The 
candidate made this statement during a political campaign event 
in western Panama: 
  [Begin Vallarino recording] This morning, we greeted and 
exchanged views with members of the Arnulfist Party here in 
Chiriqui. The talks that failed, however, were the ones we held 
at my residence in the past few days. First, we invited the 
Arnulfist alliance and then Carles' alliance to try to 
reconcile, to unite them. Our position was that, if we managed 
to get them to reach an agreement to establish a great civilist 
alliance, we would support that civilist alliance. This was not 
possible because neither candidate was willing to yield to the 
other. In view of this, we simply had to put an end to our 
efforts. 
  I repeat, in order to achieve this, we said we would be 
willing to renounce our candidacy at a very high political cost 
to our party. The unwillingness of the two candidates to 
renounce their candidacies created a mathematical impossibility: 
there can be no great alliance with two leaders. This 
frustrated the talks. [end recording]

  [Text] The Brazilian Social Democracy Party [PSDB] and the 
Liberal Front Party [PFL] will base their alliance on a 
government program. Former Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes and PSDB presidential candidate Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso today met in Rio de Janeiro to discuss the nomination of 
the candidate for vice president on the PSDB-PFL ticket. After a 
two-hour meeting, the former governor announced that his son, 
Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, would not run for vice president 
on Cardoso's ticket. 
  In Brasilia, Deputy Magalhaes confirmed his father's 
announcement. Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, who is the PFL leader in 
Congress, said he never wanted to be vice president. 
  [Begin Magalhaes recording] I do not want to run for vice 
president. I believe there are other qualified candidates in 
our party. Next week, the PFL national and congressional 
leaders will be nominating someone else. [end recording] 
  Former Governor Magalhaes gave details of his meeting with 
Cardoso. 
  [Begin Magalhaes recording] I discussed with him his 
political strategy, campaign issues, how to make the campaign 
gain momentum more rapidly in Bahia State and the northeastern 
region, and I conveyed to him our support for his candidacy. 
The first thing I told him is that I support him. After 
conveying to him my support, I felt at ease to give him my 
thoughts, and he democratically listened to me. He respectfully 
discussed these ideas with me, thus confirming the qualities 
that would enable him to lead Brazil as president of the nation. 
[end recording] 
  The former governor noted that it was the party's decision 
to 
have Deputy Magalhaes nominated as vice president. He regretted 
the deputy's refusal, but noted that the party must respect Luis 
Eduardo's decision, and announced that the PFL will nominate 
someone else.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 1 May (DPA) -- The private 
Caracol radio station reported the Colombian Government decreed 
a state of internal disturbance tonight, thereby preventing the 
release of more than 700 inmates, including dangerous 
terrorists, drug traffickers, and guerrillas. This mechanism 
authorizes President Cesar Gaviria to issue special, temporary 
laws without the approval of the National Congress. 
  This is the only mechanism available to the Gaviria 
administration to prevent the mass release of inmates upon the 
completion of their prison terms because public prosecutors have 
failed to study their cases to begin their trials. 
  The decrees issued by Gaviria during this period will be 
valid for as long as the state of exception is in effect. 
According to the Constitution, the state of internal 
disturbance could last 90 days and could be extended for an 
additional 90 days.

  [Text] Quito, 1 May, (EFE) -- The 15,870 polling stations 
throughout Ecuador opened to voters today at 0700 (1200 GMT) for 
legislative, provincial, and municipal elections, which promise 
few surprises. 
  For several months now, the unanimous prediction has been 
that the opposition Social Christian Party will win. All that 
remains to be seen is the proportion of their victory over Sixto 
Duran-Ballen's conservative government. 
  According to local radio and television stations, election 
day, which concludes at 1700 (2200 GMT), began with no major 
incidents. 
  More than 20,000 candidates from 17 political parties are 
competing for the votes of 6.2 million voters. The people must 
renew 65 of the 77 seats at the single-chamber Congress for a 
two-year term. Also during today's vote, Ecuadoreans will elect 
54 provincial council members and 607 municipal council members 
to a four-year term.

  [Text] A group of six UN/OAS civilian mission observers in 
charge of monitoring respect of human rights had to turn around 
and depart on 29 April following a hostile demonstration [words 
indistinct] in the town of Le Borgne in the north of Haiti, UN 
spokesman in Haiti Eric Falt told AFP on 1 May. The mission had 
come to investigate the situation in this region, 50 km west of 
Cap-Haitien and 260 km from the capital, where Army units led an 
operation over the past weekend against (?a group of) presumed 
armed partisans of President Aristide, according to Haitian 
military officials. 
  Before their departure, the observers were able to converse 
for 10 minutes with the local populace and had a very animated 
but courteous 45-minute discussion with a special military 
delegation from Port-au-Prince, headed by an unidentified 
high-ranking officer. They were not allowed to enter the town, 
however, and remained at the Le Bourgne military outpost, the 
diplomat explained. 
  [Words indistinct] refused to make any assessment of the 
situation in this area, pointing out that a communique will be 
published by the civilian mission in the next few days. A group 
of U.S. journalists was obliged to hurriedly leave the area, 
before the observers did, in the face of a similar but much more 
aggressive demonstration, Falt said. 
  On the other hand, other observers were able to go without 
incident to Gonaives, 152 km northwest of Port-au-Prince, where 
28 persons were allegedly killed on 22 April by soldiers in the 
slum neighborhood of Raboteau. According to Eric Falt's 
announcement on 1 May, a communique from the civilian mission 
should be published in that regard on 2 May in Port-au-Prince.

  [Text] The Movement of Young Patriots [MOJEP] demands a 
total embargo to resolve the current crisis. The secretariat of 
MOJEP, as a political organization involved in the struggle of 
the Haitian people for the return of democracy, peace, and 
social security in the interest of all Haitians, is pleased to 
send this letter to Haiti's four friendly countries, the United 
States, France, Canada, and Venezuela, to solicit a total and 
impartial blockade to force the criminals of Port-au-Prince to 
hand over power to constitutional Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. They have monopolized it since the 
bloody military coup of 29 September 1991. 
  Dear countries friendly to Haiti, says MOJEP, we pray you to 
please show understanding by granting us this request. We count 
on your spirit of collaboration, says the letter signed by [word 
indistinct] Herve, organization secretary general, and Louis 
Bauduy Francois.

  [Text] Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer has reiterated 
his opposition to reinforcing the embargo against the military 
regime of Port-au-Prince. The Dominican president stated: The UN 
countries have demanded reinforcement of those sanctions; I am 
against those sanctions. Balaguer explained that his regime does 
not agree with reinforcing the embargo even though it is 
demanded by the United States. The Dominican Republic is part of 
the United Nations. 
  Previously, [according to] the texts, or at least the 
analyses presented by the Dominican newspapers EL DIARIO and 
LISTIN DIARIO, for example, Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer 
stated that only humanitarian aid should pass over the border 
separating the two countries.

  [Text] A French humanitarian organization denounces the 
effects of the embargo on the Haitian population. The 
organization called International Action Against Hunger 
denounced the harmful effects of the UN sanctions on the 
civilian population in Haiti and thinks that the country is 
threatened by a major catastrophe. In a communique issued in 
Paris, the association calls attention to the alarming 
deterioration of the situation in Haiti, where terror expands 
day by day and where car traffic is almost impossible because of 
lack of fuel.

  [Text] According to a reliable source, there will be new 
food distribution aid to the victims of Cite-Soleil, beginning 
on 2 May. This distribution of food products is aimed at 
relieving the population of Cite-Soleil, victims of a violent 
fire on 27 December 1993. 
  Furthermore, on 27 April, a note from the Ministry of Public 
Health pointed out the importance of a vast program to rebuild 
the small houses destroyed during the fire, which will require 
the sum of 35 million gourdes. MSPP [Ministry of Public Health 
and Population] had since promised the distribution of food to 
the victims. 
  Many victims of the 27 December 1993 fire in Cite-Soleil 
demand that the Ministry of Public Health provide them with 
efficient help. In a news release dated 30 April, the Committee 
for People Whose Houses Burned in Cite-Soleil protested the 
meagre portions of rice and cooking oil distributed to the 
victims. It is also demanding sanitary conditions adequate for 
survival. Those signing the news release are threatening to 
demonstrate their dissatisfaction today in Cite Soleil during 
the food distribution planned by MSPP.

<F P=106> [Article by Victor Cardoso] </F>
  [Text] As of this month, the Communications and 
Transportation Secretariat (SCT) will be able to detect and 
locate -- almost immediately anywhere in the country -- any 
radio station transmitting unauthorized telecommunications 
signals, including those of the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army (EZLN), or any equipment seized from drug traffickers. 
  In order to do this, last year, the SCT began to install 42 
radio monitoring stations that cover all national territory. 
Two or more stations were installed in seven states where there 
are high crime rates or social problems (Baja California, 
Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Guerrero, Veracruz, Tamaulipas, and 
Chiapas), while the rest will have only one station. 
  A high-ranking SCT official also confirmed that these 
actions 
will detect and locate the communications signals of the EZLN, 
which has been illegally using the microwave network owned by 
the Mexican Telephone Company. 
  It was unofficially learned that work was being done to 
replace the internal telephone network of the federal government 
(also known as the red telephone) with safer, more reliable 
technology less susceptible to interception. All federal 
government offices agreed to this change in November of last 
year, but the Government Secretariat raised many obstacles when 
the SCT technicians tried to do their work. 
  Through the National Radio Monitoring Network (RNR), which 
is 
part of the National Board for Assigning Frequencies, the SCT 
will be able to determine the location of any transmission that 
is made within national territory. This network has the most 
advanced equipment in radio communications and computer 
technology. 
  Officially, the goal is to regulate and normalize radio 
communication services in the nation, and it is the result of 
continuous efforts by the SCT to modernize, organize, and 
regulate telecommunications in the country. 
  The provisions established in Radio Communication 
Regulations 
of the International Telecommunications Union as well as other 
factors that result when one's own needs are met were taken into 
consideration in order to begin operations. These are actions 
related to national security, and therefore some were made in 
absolute privacy at the highest level of the government. 
  It is justified in everyday activities since it regulates 
the 
broadcasting of signals used by industry, business, medical and 
educational services, transportation, and so forth through the 
entire radio electric spectrum by microwave, fiber optics, and 
satellites in frequency, both VHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF 
(Ultra High Frequency), that is, ranging from 10 kHz to 18 
gigahertz. 
  Likewise, through the RNR, which will begin operations this 
month, one will be able to locate the source of any unauthorized 
broadcast or broadcasts that interfere with any frequency 
throughout the country. "Coordinating emergency assistance in 
cases of disaster or national emergency," as well as "improving 
surveillance and controlling services through the use of mobile 
units in coordination with stationary equipment for data 
processing and inspection," are among the objectives of the SCT 
with respect to the RNR. 
  "The radio electric spectrum is a common good that is used 
in 
the systems of radio communications such as radio, television, 
microwaves, radio telephone system, air and maritime radio 
navigation, space communications, and military communications, 
among others," says a SCT document based on the implementation 
of the National Board for Assigning Frequencies. 
  It considers other important aspects of the use of the radio 
electric spectrum, inasmuch as telecommunications "promotes the 
integration of Mexico; strengthens the institutions of the three 
levels of government; supports and promotes employment and 
national industry; supports and coordinates agricultural, 
livestock, fishing, and mining activities, as well as trade, 
transportation, and communications; and provides entertainment 
and disseminates news and information." 
  According to the document issued by the General Directorate 
of Telecommunications, an office of the Undersecretariat of 
Communications and Technological Development, that refers to the 
National Board for Assigning Frequencies of Mexico 1993, the RNR 
will be organized as follows: 
  The RNR will have a control center located in Mexico City 
for 
its administration and control. It will have fixed primary and 
secondary stations, remote stations, and mobile stations 
assisted by a computer as well as by portable survey equipment. 
  The RNR will be organized with a Control Center, fixed 
stations (primary and secondary), and remotes (Group "C.2") as a 
star type which will enable remote access of data and 
operational control, when necessary, from the above mentioned 
Control Center. 
  Likewise, four secondary stations will have remote ancillary 
stations to control, including the transfer of 
data. 

  -  Communication, information, and voice links to 
transfer data from remote control sites will use the SCT 
telecomputer network and the Mexican Telephone [Telemex] public 
network to access the database on the radio spectrum and 
coordinate it. 
  -  The RNR stations will monitor the LF [low 
frequency] to UHF bands (from 10 kHz to 2.0 gHz) at fixed 
stations and mobile units, and with portable inspection 
equipment up to 18 gHz. 
  -  The RNR stations will cruise radio 
broadcasts using interferometry in MF [medium frequency] and HF 
[high frequency] and direction finders in VHF and UHF in fixed 
stations and from MF to UHF in mobile units. 
<H5>  RNR Operations </H5>
  According to the document, the RNR stations will operate 24 
hours a day, 365 days a year. The Control Center will be 
responsible, at a national level, for the RNR's radio monitoring 
and radio cruising activities. The Control Center will be the 
channel to access the information obtained on the radio 
spectrum, thereby establishing an effective correlation with the 
available radio information. 
  The Control Center's computers will be interconnected to 
operate as a local area network (LAN) so that any computer 
station can be used to control the equipment, the communication 
network, triangulation, supervision, and analysis separately as 
well as to operate any radio monitoring station by remote 
control. 
<H5>  Radio Monitoring </H5>
  Each of the stations, according to their classification, 
will 
automatically carry out the assigned tasks assisted by the 
computer. At any time, the operators will be able to analyze 
the information obtained from several of the regular parameters 
against the anomalies presented by one or several broadcasts; 
repeatedly gauging the broadcasts; and storing, taping, and 
preparing a report on the information from the located broadcast. 
<H5>  Radio Cruising </H5>
  This task, according to the document, will be carried out if 
any of the RNR stations, the Control Center, or the central 
office of the SCT and its centers, or an office of another 
country, requests a search for an interfering or unauthorized 
broadcast source. The coordination of this activity will be the 
responsibility of the Control Center, which can require the 
intervention of all the stations that have a radio cruising 
system (Group "A.") The information (coordinates and 
identification of the station, readings obtained from the 
interfered: distance, coordinates, etc.) will be fed into the 
triangulation system where the broadcast location area will be 
displayed automatically, producing a printed report on digitized 
maps. 
  The "B.1" Group stations tasked with radio monitoring and 
radio cruising in VHF-UHF will be supported by remote urban 
stations (Group "C.1") linked through the Telmex telephone 
network. The remote stations' control will be automatic. 
  For the triangulation task at the Control Center and Group 
"B.1" stations, the software [previous word in English] will 
present cruising of the broadcast location area and will produce 
a report on the printer or plotter [previous word in English]. 
In the case of the Group "B.1" stations, they can transfer this 
information to the Control Center. 
<H5>  Primary Stations </H5>
  Group "A" comprises fixed stations that will monitor radio 
stations in the bands from LF to UHF (10 kHz up to 2.0 gHz) and 
cruise with interferometry from MF up to HF (1.0 MHz to 30 MHz). 
They are located in Cerrillo, Mexico; Hermosillo, Sonora; 
Merida, Yucatan; San Fernando, Tamaulipas; and Tapachula, 
Chiapas. 
<H5>  Secondary Stations </H5>
  To carry out their tasks, those stations will be subdivided 
into: 
  Group "B.1." -- Fixed radio monitoring stations within the 
bands LF to UHF (10 kHz to 2.0 gHz) and radio cruising with 
direction finders in the VHF and UHF bands (20 mHz to 1.0 gHz). 
They are located in Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey, and 
Tijuana, and they will also control subnetworks in the remote 
stations (urban) mentioned in Group "C.1." 
  Group "B.2." Fixed radio monitoring stations in the bands 
from LF to UHF (10 kHz up to 2.0 gHz). They are located in 
Acapulco, Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Leon, Mazatlan, Morelia, 
Oaxaca, Puebla, Tampico, Torreon, San Luis Potosi, Veracruz, and 
Villahermosa. 
<H5>  Remote Stations </H5>
  Group "C.1." Remote radio monitoring stations (20 mHz to 2.0 
gHz) and radio cruising in the VHF and UHF bands (20 mHz to 1.0 
gHz). They form urban networks controlled from the fixed 
stations of Group "B.1," located in Guadalajara, Mexico City, 
Monterrey, and Tijuana. 
  Group "C.2." Remote stations are only for radio monitoring 
in 
the VHF and UHF bands (20 mHz to 2.0 gHz). They are located in 
Aguascalientes, Campeche, Ciudad Victoria, Colima, Cuernavaca, 
Culiacan, Cancun, Chilpancingo, Durango, Jalapa, La Paz, 
Mexicali, Nuevo Laredo, Pachuca, Queretaro, Saltillo, Tepic, 
Tlaxcala, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Zacatecas. 
<H5>  Mobile Units </H5>
  This type of mobile unit will work as a fixed station in 
places where, because of topography, the propagation of 
electromagnetic waves, the curvature of the earth, and other 
factors, it is impossible to detect broadcasts from a fixed 
place. They will be distributed throughout the republic of 
Mexico. They will mainly monitor in the bands from LF to UHF 
(10 kHz to 2.0 gHz) and cruise with interferometry (1 mHz to 1.0 
gHz), including television broadcasts. 
  Finally, the document mentions that the telecomputer network 
is essential to complete the radio monitoring network and to 
establish a compatible network throughout the country, as well 
as the primary countries with which Mexico has relations. 
  To this end, in August 1993, the installation of 32 
satellite 
stations, Very Small Aperture Terminal type, was completed; 62 
computer systems were installed with the appropriate software 
[previous word in English] and collateral equipment; and Mexican 
engineers were trained in the management and optimal use of this 
equimpment. 
  The network was designed to work in coordination with other 
modern devices to be able to efficiently broadcast the 
information from directional beacons, multiplexers, modems, and 
leading radio technology equipment. 
  The computer's central node is in the metropolitan area; it 
uses fiber optic and satellite communication, ensuring quick and 
reliable broadcasts to the SCT centers and central offices.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Antonio Roman] </F>
  [Text] Ocosingo, Chiapas State, 26 Apr -- In an urgent 
appeal, Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno asked Manuel 
Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in 
Chiapas; Bishop Samuel Ruiz; national and state human rights 
commissions; the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]; the 
ARIC [Rural Association of Community Interest); and even those 
displaced by the armed conflict to establish, together with the 
state government, the Agrarian Reform Secretariat, and other 
appropriate authorities and organizations, a commission for 
community reconciliation in the strife-torn area. 
  In a new visit to the municipality that was the site of the 
1 
January armed conflict, the governor met with ARIC-Union of 
Unions [Union de Uniones] representatives and ranchers. He 
promised the ARIC that he will try to obtain the release of four 
Indians who have been in prison since May of last year in El 
Carmen Patate Ejido on charges of killing two soldiers. In 
addition, the official assured the cattlemen that he will 
enforce orders for the arrest of those who have occupied lands 
after 15 April and do his best to resolve the squatting problem. 
  During a brief stay in this town, the governor assessed the 
reconstruction projects here and met at this city's Lions Club 
office with over 20 organizations and groups, including 16 
alleged Zapatists recently released from the Cerro Hueco Prison. 
After having their photograph taken with the governor, the 
latter demanded compensation for the moral and economic hardship 
they suffered while being incarcerated for over three months 
without any charges having been made against them. The state 
governor agreed to grant them a loan to help them in a farming 
program, and that is why they went to Tuxtla Gutierrez today. 
  In a radio message broadcast to all residents from the XEOCH 
radio station in this town, where the constant movement of 
vehicles and military troops can still be seen in the streets, 
the governor indicated that if the commission for community 
reconciliation in the strife-torn zone is created, it could 
become the forum for reaching agreements on minimal rules to 
allow reconciliation and avoid further confrontation. Lopez 
Moreno added that in this region it is particularly necessary to 
ensure that there will be no more evictions, invasions, attacks, 
or threats on individuals or homes, personal property, or the 
real estate of those living there. "We need to guarantee the 
free flow of people and products, mostly consumer goods and 
staple products and medicines," the governor said in his 
message, which was broadcast all day long in Tzeltal. 
  In this new recent visit to one of the towns that was the 
site of January's armed conflict, Lopez Moreno asked the sides 
that have been summoned to respond positively to his appeal to 
further efforts toward seeking a dignified, just, and lasting 
peace and to make genuine social solidarity stronger. The 
governor said the commission's goal is to set up forums for 
consensus among all the parties in the most convenient places. 
"We will examine the people's problems and together we will 
decide what must be done. Let us put our agreement in writing 
and abide by it." 
  From the radio station's small booth, surrounded by 
announcers, photographers, and cameramen who covered his brief 
working visit to the capital city of this municipality, Lopez 
Moreno warned that without respect it will not be possible to go 
anywhere unless we are prepared to let violence flare up again. 
"We must act with haste. If we let more time go by, later will 
be too late. Let us prevent a war among brothers. Let us make 
a new contribution to the general peace effort in the state. 
The commission I propose will allow us to prepare for the 
signing of the peace agreement so all will go smoothly and so it 
will take affect immediately." 
  He then added that Chiapas residents want peace. "We want 
local residents to return to their jobs; to work the land; to 
get rid of their fear and anxiety; to travel about without fear; 
to be at peace in their homes; to enjoy life and the things they 
own; to trade and to study; in sum, we want a return to 
normalcy. We must resolve the problems down there based on an 
awareness of the new situation." 
  The governor also mentioned last night's meeting, when the 
Executive Commission for Agrarian Affairs was created. "For the 
sake of peace and for the first time in our history, social 
leaders, cattlemen, bankers, and peasants met with the 
government last night to find together solutions to our 
problems, fully aware that either we are all saved or we are all 
lost." 
  In the meeting with ARIC-Union of Unions delegates, 
president 
Lazaro Hernandez Vasquez voiced the concern of the people of 
Ocosingo and Las Margaritas at the delay in signing the peace 
agreements. Several delegates told the governor of the 
agricultural backwardness from which peasant organizations and 
members of ARIC suffer. The delegates requested financial 
assistance to buy land and implement production programs. 
Santiago Lorenzo Jimenez, ARIC's commissioner for 
reconciliation, asked the governor to intervene to secure the 
release of Melchor Jimenez Lopez, Antonio Lopez Jimenez, Manuel 
Lara Ruiz, and Tiburcio Ruiz Lara, who have been held in the 
Cerro Hueco prison since May of last year when two military men 
died during an armed confrontation with "several unidentified 
individuals."

<F P=106> [By Noel Lorthiois] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City, Apr 26 (AFP) -- President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's government is exhibiting weakness in its 
four remaining months in power to such an extent that it is 
systematically appointing "commissions" to solve problems that 
are normally handled by corresponding ministries. 
  The three most important problems that have arisen in the 
past four months in Mexico (the Chiapas insurrection, Luis 
Donaldo Colosio's murder, public security, and a chain of 
kidnapping cases) are being handled by special commissions 
directly appointed by the Presidency. 
  This trend, according to analysts, bolsters the lack of 
credibility by the corresponding offices, where corruption and 
bureaucracy usually prevail, as several high-ranking government 
officials have confessed. It also furthers the opposition's 
charges of centralism and authoritarianism against the president 
and his party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), 
which has been in power for the past 65 years. 
  The latest commission, the "Coordination for the Nation's 
Public Security," was established yesterday, Monday. As an 
irony of destiny or headstrong interventionism, the announcement 
of its creation coincided with the announcement of a new 
kidnapping: that of Angel Lozada Moreno, son of the owner of the 
most important supermarket group, Gigante. This kidnapping 
occurred 40 days after the kidnapping of banker Alfredo Harp 
Helu, president of the group Ranamex-Accival. 
  The new organization, which is directed by Arsenio Farell, 
who until now had been labor secretary, must "coordinate" the 
public security-related activities of the secretariats of 
government, justice, the Army, and the Department of the Federal 
District (the capital), according to a communique from the 
Presidency. 
  The president had already appointed a special commission 
composed of "notable citizens" a few days ago. This commission 
was charged with continuing the investigations into the 
assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the late PRI presidential 
candidate who was murdered on 23 March. 
  The creation of this commission took place following the 
appointment of Miguel Montes as "special deputy prosecutor" to 
oversee the investigations into the assassination. Montes is 
still working on this duty. His appointment, which was made 
five days after the assassination, caused surprise because the 
investigations should normally have been handled by the nation's 
attorney general, Diego Valadez. The Chamber of Deputies, where 
the PRI holds a broad majority, also decided that day to appoint 
a parliamentary investigatory commission, perhaps to avoid 
criticism of doing less than others. 
  Many shadows surround the investigations and the way they 
have been conducted while the authorities, the special deputy 
prosecutor, and the investigatory commissions maintain absolute 
silence. 
  The creation of special commissions began in January with 
the 
appointment of Manuel Camacho Solis as "special commissioner" to 
oversee the establishment of a dialogue with the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army, the guerrilla movement that emerged at 
the beginning of the year in Chiapas. 
  The matter could have been handled by the government 
secretary, but he, Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, who had been 
criticized due to his performance when he was Chiapas governor, 
had to be quickly replaced. According to institutional systems, 
the matter should have been handled by the current government 
secretary, Jorge Carpizo. 
  We could finally mention the National Commission for the 
Integral Development of the Indian People, which was created 
shortly after the Chiapas insurrection. Four months after the 
creation of this commission, Beatriz Paredes, who headed it, was 
appointed, on 18 April, deputy government secretary in charge of 
public development and no one replaced her at the head of the 
commission about whose future the authorities have said nothing.

<F P=106> [Report by Ismael Romero, Victor Cardoso, Angelica Enciso, </F>

  [Text] 
<H5>  There Is no Guarantee for Clean Elections, They </H5>
Noted 
  Leaders of the National Action Party (PAN), the Party of the 
Democratic Revolution (PRD), and representatives of human rights 
organizations have demanded that the federal government explain 
why it purchased riot gear and what its use will be because 
"this is an ominous act reflecting anxiety within the government 
and indicating its preparation to confront problems and social 
demonstrations in the country." They believe this decision 
suggests that the government will not be able to guarantee clean 
presidential elections because it is preparing to face 
postelection discontent. 
  Andres Rozental, deputy foreign relations secretary, denied 
that importing riot vehicles reflects fears of possible 
outbreaks of violence after the August elections. The official 
said the purchase of armored equipment is "a natural development 
in all world countries," adding that any claim it will serve to 
control postelection disturbances is "irresponsible." Rozental 
explained that importing 24 riot units was the responsibility of 
the National Defense Secretariat, which has been totally silent. 
The Media Directorate only stated "they do not know anything 
yet." He criticized the U.S. newspaper that reported this for 
doing so "without having any evidence," indicating that the 
purchase is indeed related to possible postelection disturbances. 
  Juan Jose Castillo Mota, deputy of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), justified the measure and said it was 
about time to enforce the law and equip security forces with the 
most modern technology. "The equipment is not to restrict 
freedom of expression, but we must start to enforce the law with 
groups of citizens who commit abuses during demonstrations, 
especially when they block highways, an action that sometimes 
involves 20 to 50 people. Thus, in these cases we must clear 
highways and enforce the law," Castillo added. 
  Last Thursday, the SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS NEWS published a 
front 
page report claiming that in the past two months the Mexican 
Government has imported at least 24 armored vehicles designed to 
control riots and that "this is apparently in preparation for 
civil disturbances after the late summer elections" in Mexico. 
<H5>  Government Adopting Hard Line: PRD </H5>
  During a tour of Los Angeles, PRD National President 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano said "the creation of the Mexican 
Public Security Coordinating Board (CSPN) and the appointment of 
Arsenio Farell to chair it shows that the government is adopting 
a hard line. The purchase of the riot equipment has the same 
purpose. "The government seeks to compensate for the evident 
weakness of its presidential candidate with these kind of 
measures." 
  Mario Saucedo, secretary general of the PRD CEN [National 
Executive Committee], said everything seems to indicate that 
this administration expects a citizen mobilization "because it 
is planning to impose its candidate." There is no doubt, he 
insisted, given the most recent measures, that "it will try to 
implement this action at all cost." 
  Ricardo Valero, coordinator of the PRD deputies, pointed out 
the most recent federal government decisions on security matters 
"are disturbing and extraordinarily dangerous." He added that a 
confirmation of the purchase of riot tanks in relation to the 
creation of the CSPN and the reappearance of figures such as 
Carlos Hank Gonzalez would "objectively" lead us to conclude 
that Salinas de Gortari has no intention of supporting a 
credible electoral process. 
  Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, spokesman for the Cardenas 
presidential campaign, pointed out that these developments "are 
clear signs of the entrenchment and hardening of the position of 
the state." He wondered: "If they will guarantee clean 
elections, what do they want armored vehicles for? 
  PRD Legislator Julio Cesar Garcia underscored the repressive 
nature of a measure such as the one that was reported, because 
it jeopardizes the constitutional rights of freedom of 
expression and of conducting public demonstrations. 
  Garcia said the government is seeking ways to protect 
itself and apply a forceful hand on possible protests following 
the presidential elections of 21 August. 
  Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, also a PRD member, demanded 
"specific information" from the government regarding the alleged 
purchase of 24 riot units and an explanation of the purpose of 
the purchase because the conclusion one might reach at this 
point is that the goal is to impose a "hard-line policy" and a 
policy of "confrontation." He added: "I do not wish to make 
predictions or speculations, but we do hope this administration 
is not thinking about using them to counter political 
demonstrations" because this possibility, which is undemocratic, 
reflects a false concept of national security." 
<H5>  PAN: Lightning That Presages a Storm </H5>
  Felipe Calderon, secretary general of the PAN's CEN, pointed 
out that "this kind of purchase is disturbing because it 
suggests that the government is preparing to confront future 
political problems." He added that resorting to this kind of 
equipment "as an element of repression" is no way to confront 
the causes of the violence that is provoked in the country. 
Actually, he said, a culture of political responsibility must 
be promoted instead of the modernization of the apparatus of 
repression. 
  PAN Federal Deputy Jose Paoli said that should the federal 
government not explain the purchase of riot vehicles, this will 
be demanded within the Chamber of Deputies. PAN Legislator 
Manuel Rivera del Campo pointed out that, although the 
authorities refuse to admit it, importing riot vehicles shows 
that "it is clear that things are not going as well in the 
country as they wish to make us believe because there are many 
problems that the government has not solved. "It is not correct 
to confront citizen protests or demonstrations through forceful 
means because they will create more problems than those that 
they are trying to solve," he added. Rivera noted that "the 
government is expecting an ungovernable situation after the 
elections and adopted this measure as a precaution against a 
conflict in order to be able to subdue the demonstrators." He 
warned: "This is lightning that presages a storm." 
<H5>  Forceful Actions and Violence: ONG [Nongovernmental </H5>
Organizations] 
  The national network of civilian human rights organizations 
also gave its opinion on the 24 riot units that the Mexican 
Government purchased in the United States. It stated that "if 
there were political will, there would be no need for tanks to 
face riots." "The purchase of this equipment suggests that there 
will be no clean presidential elections," it added. 
  Mariclaire Acosta, of the Mexican Defense and Protection of 
Human Rights Commission [Comision Mexicana de Defensa y 
Proteccion de los Derechos Humanos], said: "We must realize that 
the government is determined to face a major postelection 
conflict." She underscored that these problems will be similar 
to those faced in France, where political disorders are settled 
through forceful and violent means. 
  Emilio Krieger, president of the National Association of 
Democratic Lawyers (ANAD), pointed out that "this is a serious" 
measure and that "one could presume that the government is 
purchasing weapons in preparation for the elections." I would 
like to know, he added, whether the purchase of these tanks is 
related to the electoral process; this must be explained not by 
the National Defense Secretariat or the Government Secretariat, 
but by the president of the republic. 
  The Roads and Safety Secretariat said the weapons it plans 
to 
purchase seek to modernize the sector. It reported that the 
pistols it will purchase will reportedly hold 18 rounds and 
added that it is currently negotiating with a Swedish company 
called Sixsahuer. 
  [Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish on 29 April on page 53 
publishes a 150-word article stating that: "Enrique Jackson, 
secretary general of the Federal District government, and 
Humberto Benitez Trevino, attorney general of the Federal 
District, said they know nothing about the purchase of riot 
equipment."]

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President-elect Dr. Armando Calderon Sol has pledged 
to fully investigate all complaints of corruption against any of 
his cabinet ministers. During an interview for the "Up-to-Date" 
newscast, the ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] leader 
expressed his resolve to place in court custody all individuals 
found guilty of corruption. 
  Dr. Calderon Sol has only one goal regarding this issue: to 
combat institutionalized corruption regardless of its cost to 
the government. According to the president-elect, he cannot 
betray the people who supported him during the past elections. 
Therefore, he says, he will get to the bottom of all complaints 
of corruption. 
  [Begin Calderon Sol recording] If there are even rumors 
against any official, we will conduct a full investigation and 
place that person in court custody for investigation. [end 
recording] 
  Corruption, says the future president, will be fought at all 
levels, but especially in those areas involving goods, services, 
and public bids. Calderon Sol also intends to put an end to 
government official's involvement in organized crime. 
  [Begin Calderon Sol recording] If any administration 
officials are thus involved, regardless of who they may be, we 
will apply the law and break this circle of organized crime. 
[end recording] 
  Calderon Sol, who will take office in June, warned that 
during his term he will manage public funds carefully and 
strengthen the development of the National Civilian Police, 
which emerged from the peace agreements.

<F P=106> [News conference by Gloria Salguero Gross and Carmen Elena </F>
Calderon de Escalon, deputies of the Nationalist Republican 
Alliance, with unidentified reporters in San Salvador -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Salguero Gross] Members of the Nationalist 
Republican Alliance [ARENA], thank you for coming. We called 
this news conference to discuss a piece of correspondence 
presented by ARENA on 29 April concerning the Assembly's 
handling of a secret allotment that is currently in existence. 
As a faction we have decided that this allotment should be 
converted into an audited fund to prove that our party intends 
to make the next five years of government crystal clear and 
honest in the eyes of the Salvadoran people. We are very 
pleased to make this announcement. The secret allotment will be 
turned into an audited fund so that it can be disclosed to the 
public. This is the situation regarding secret expenses. 
  As for the presidential tax exemptions, we are going to 
eliminate them. There will be no presidential tax exemptions so 
the people can see what ARENA's intentions are. We will also 
eliminate the Supreme Court of Justice's tax exemptions because 
we believe that will also be a positive step. 
  I would like my colleague Dona Carmen Elena Calderon de 
Escalon to explain the changes in tax exemptions granted to 
deputies. 
  [Station announcer] Deputy Carmen Elena Calderon de Escalon 
will discuss the tax exemptions. 
  [Calderon de Escalon] ARENA as a party wants to ensure 
greater honesty and austerity; we believe that in the past the 
tax exemptions granted to deputies gave them access to a 
considerable amount of money, and on Friday we proposed to the 
plenum that deputies be authorized to purchase only one vehicle 
tax-free during the term of the principal deputy, without 
establishing any price limits to ensure that the tax exemption 
will never be used for any other purpose. This, I believe, will 
help the Salvadoran people understand that the politicians of 
this country are working on a daily basis to improve their 
image, which is what all the members of this new assembly want. 
I am certain they will approve this piece of correspondence. 
  I wanted to say this because Friday was a very important 
day; 
constitutional reforms were also approved that day. 
Additionally, ARENA also believes that the Supreme Court's 
secret fund is no longer justified because the Constitution 
establishes that the Supreme Court receive the resources it 
requires. In other words, all monies must be confirmed by the 
Accounts Court [corte de cuentas]. I believe this will 
contribute to the honest management of funds throughout the 
entire country. Thank you. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada by Haroldo </F>
Shetemul; date and place not given; first paragraph is 
introduction] 
  [Text] Following a brief period of calm, Monsignor Rodolfo 
Quezada's life has returned to its hectic pace. As a result of 
the agreements between the government and the URNG [Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity], the Civilian Society Assembly 
[Asamblea de la Sociedad Civil] was created. UN Moderator Jean 
Arnault has asked the Guatemalan Bishops Conference to head the 
coordination of this body, which must discuss and propose 
positions of consensus to the sides that are holding the talks 
abroad. 
  [Shetemul] Why has the Bishops Conference decided to name 
you 
president of the Civilian Society Assembly? 
  [Quezada] The conference had always said it wanted to assist 
in the peace process, and the bishops have noticed the sides 
showed a political commitment when they signed the Overall 
Agreement on Human Rights and Immediate International 
Verification [Acuerdo Global de Derechos Humanos y la 
Verificacion Internacional Immediata] and agreed to establish a 
timetable for the process. Another reason was the assembly will 
be convened at the request of the United Nations and the sides, 
unlike the Permanent Forum for Peace, a unilateral proposal by 
the government. Pope John Paul II had asked us to help in the 
reconciliation. 
  [Shetemul] What will be the assembly's purpose? 
  [Quezada] To convene and gather all nongovernment civilian, 
political, religious, business, mass, and Mayan sectors. We 
will discuss the substantial topic of the Mexico agreements to 
reach a consensus and expedite the end of the confrontation. 
  [Shetemul] Wouldn't the diversity of interests involved pose 
an obstacle to a consensus? 
  [Quezada] It is certainly something which is very difficult 
and complex. The easiest thing would be not to participate, but 
I believe taking the risk is worth it. For that reason, the 
conference has set its conditions to make the assembly 
effective. One of them is that we will not discuss 
circumstantial topics, only substantial ones. We will hold the 
assembly if most sectors participate, and it will last five 
months. We will avoid the distortion of topics and seek a 
consensus, but if we do not find it, we can present qualified 
majority opinions; besides, minorities' opinions will always be 
present. 
  [Shetemul] What role will you play in the assembly? 
  [Quezada] The assembly president's responsibilities are to 
moderate the meetings and create the mechanisms to make 
everybody's participation effective, all within a democratic 
atmosphere. The president must try to have a group coordinator 
in every sector to assist him. In the end, when a consensus or 
opinions are agreed on, he must take them to Mexico for 
submission to the government and the URNG. Upon returning to 
the country, he has to report to the assembly the results of the 
agreements made in Mexico. 
  [Shetemul] What are the topics to be discussed? 
  [Quezada] The resettlement of those uprooted by the armed 
confrontation, the rights and identification of ethnic groups, 
the prevalence of civilian authority, and the Army's role in a 
democratic society, socioeconomic aspects, farming issues, 
constitutional amendments, and the Law on Electoral and 
Political Parties. 
  [Shetemul] Those are the same topics up for discussion in 
Mexico. What decisive role will the assembly play on the peace 
accord? 
  [Quezada] If the social sectors do not participate, the 
government and the URNG will make the decisions, regardless of 
what we, as civilian society, think, meaning we are going to 
delegate the decisions to eight or 10 people. If we participate 
and reach a consensus, our opinions will carry a very strong 
moral weight at the negotiations table. 
  [Shetemul] The Coordinating Committee for Agriculture, 
Commercial, Financial, and Industrial Associations (Cacif) was 
opposed to joining the national dialogue in the past. What 
would happen if it does not participate? 
  [Quezada] When Cacif states whether it will participate, the 
assembly, not the person presiding over it, will have to decide 
how to move forward. I personally trust the business sector 
will understand the need to participate. 
  [Shetemul] Considering there are many similar organizations, 
what criteria will be employed regarding the sectors' 
representation? 
  [Quezada] We are talking of legality, representation, and 
legitimacy. Many institutions do not have legal status, while 
others have difficulty proving their legitimacy. In sum, the 
main condition is that they not be outside the law. 
  [Shetemul] What about the groups that lack legal status, 
such as the Peasants Unity Committee (CUC)? 
  [Quezada] I have not analyzed it specifically, but during 
the 
national dialogue such organizations as the CUC participated 
under the umbrella of the Labor and Popular Action Union (UASP). 
  [Shetemul] Why has the Bishops Conference deemed the 
government's peace plan unviable, and now that it is working, 
why has it decided to join the negotiation process? 
  [Quezada] We bishops have always thought the break in 
negotiations was due to the parties' lack of political resolve, 
not to the arrangement of the negotiations. This is why the 
Bishops Conference has decided to withdraw from the process, 
refusing to participate in the Permanent Forum for Peace, 
because it was unviable and too broad. In addition, the 
government unilaterally conceived the 4 October 1993 peace plan. 
We could not accept it. We had to stay away from the 
conflicting parties. There is an agreement between the two 
parties, and it has been specified what the assembly must do. 
We bishops will cooperate in the process, because it is an 
evangelical mandate. 
  [Shetemul] The government did not want you to continue in 
the peace process last year. Do you think it has changed its 
mind? 
  [Quezada] I know that at least Ramiro de Leon Carpio is glad 
I have accepted the presidency of the assembly. 
  [Shetemul] Alfonso Cabrera and Rigoberta Menchu will submit 
alternate peace plans separately. Will their proposal be 
viable, or are they trying to assume starring roles? 
  [Quezada] I have not talked with Alfonso lately, but I 
talked 
with Rigoberta. I understand she will participate in the 
ecumenical meeting that will take place next week. She will 
propose a plan, but I do not know what it is. 
  [Shetemul] Menchu is skeptical of a possible signing of a 
definite peace agreement by the end of the year. 
  [Quezada] I respect her opinion. There is a calendar, 
however. Should the Civilian Society Assembly be successful, 
should there be political resolve by the parties to reach an 
agreement, and should the international community support us, I 
truly believe peace will be possible by the end of the year. 
This process is irreversible, but we must think if we want a 
peace on paper or a sound peace to prevent the emergence of 
other guerrillas. 
  [Shetemul] Could it be the advancements made are due to 
international pressure and not to parties' political resolve? 
  [Quezada] I cannot give an opinion from the outside, but it 
is obvious the international community has indeed helped 
expedite the process. 
  [Shetemul] The public sectors are saying militarization of 
the police is a setback for society. Does this situation affect 
the negotiation process? 
  [Quezada] I am not in the position to say so. I want to 
steer the vessel toward national consensus. I do not want to 
waste time on secondary issues that could tangle up an already 
complicated negotiation. 
  [Shetemul] Could your attitude be interpreted as ignoring 
reality? 
  [Quezada] I have been commissioned to reach consensus on 
five 
issues. In this case, the country's governability is an issue I 
refuse to discuss, regardless of how important and significant 
it is. 
  [Shetemul] Is the political system ready for a postwar 
period? 
  [Quezada] This is an issue the government and the guerrillas 
will have to address when they discuss the grounds for the URNG 
to join the country's political arena, but that is another bowl 
of fish. 
  [Shetemul] When will the assembly begin work? 
  [Quezada] I want the group of sectors to be ready by next 
week at any rate. This group will address the issue of creating 
settlements for the uprooted civilian population. We do not 
want to be late for the May meeting in Mexico. 
  [Shetemul] What will be the financial source of your new 
task? 
  [Quezada] We already have the necessary infrastructure. I do 
not want governmental funds. Money will come from friendly 
countries. 
  [Shetemul] Media reports indicate the guerrilla commanders 
could attend the next ecumenical meeting. Is that true? 
  [Quezada] No, but I do not dismiss the possibility the 
guerrilla leadership may send a communique. The U.S. Lutheran, 
Catholic, and Evangelical Churches are organizing that meeting. 
We want the people to give their opinions. 
  [Shetemul] Do you still criticize the secrecy of the peace 
process? 
  [Quezada] Yes. Secrecy is one of the main problems plaguing 
the peace process, because it prevents the media from being well 
informed to prevent speculations. In short, the parties have 
decided to maintain this secrecy, and I only hope the process 
will continue.

  [Text] The National Congress yesterday approved a law that 
will impose the death penalty in cases in which defendants are 
convicted of kidnapping children under the age of 12 or elderly 
people over the age of 70. The measure is included among the 
law enforcement amendments requested by the executive branch. 
The law is contained in Decree 38-94, which amends Article 201 
of the Penal Code (Decree 17-73). 
  After President Ramiro de Leon Carpio submitted a request 
asking for the death penalty, the Legislative and Constitutional 
Issues Committee made some changes and overturned a ruling by 
the Government Committee, which requested penalties of only 
25-30 years in prison. 
  Article 201 of the Penal Code now reads as follows: The 
abducting or kidnapping of a person to collect ransom or 
payment, or to exchange the abductee for a third party, as well 
as the committing of other related or similar illicit and 
money-making activities shall be punished with a 25-year prison 
term. The death penalty shall be imposed in the following 
cases: A) should the abductee be under the age of 12 or over the 
age of 70; B) should the abductee die, sustain serious or grave 
injuries, or suffer permanent physical or psychological trauma 
as a result of the kidnapping. 
  Should the criminal repent at any stage of the process or 
provide leads to solve the kidnapping or abduction case 
satisfactorily, the corresponding sentence could be mitigated.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Official 
sources reported today that Guatemala has agreed to lend its 
territory for the repatriation of Taiwan immigrants in response 
to a request from the International Migration Organization 
[Organizacion Internacional para las Migraciones, OIM]. 
  Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz Vielmann has said that, based 
on a request from the United States and Taiwan, the government 
agreed to do this "as a demonstration of cooperation with the 
OIM," but cautioned that "this decision must not be understood 
as setting a precedent." Vielmann told the media: "The 
cooperation being extended now does not constitute a 
manifestation of a policy in this regard." 
  Guatemala will permit the ship Jinn Yinn I to dock at a 
Guatemalan port. The passengers, who have been traveling in 
very crowded conditions, comprise 102 Chinese [as received] who 
were intercepted without legal documents in waters off 
California by U.S. Coast Guard units. 
  According to Vielmann, President Ramiro De Leon ordered the 
Foreign Relations, Government, and Defense Ministries to form a 
commission to coordinate details for the debarkation and 
"immediate deportation" of the travelers.

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Mora; from the "Extravision" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said a national 
council will be created in search of a national agreement with 
the help of all sectors of the country. Lacayo said he got the 
idea from Ramiro Gurdian, president of the Cosep [Higher Council 
of Private Enterprise], but the important thing is to seek 
economic stability for at least the next five years. 
  The search for a national agreement could start in 
approximately two months, according to Presidency Minister 
Lacayo, who said he will ask all forces in the country to fill 
out a questionnaire to decide on the number and names of members 
of the national council, which will be holding periodic sessions 
in search of a national agreement. 
  [Begin Lacayo recording] We have been talking about that 
with 
Engineer Gurdian and with the National Planning Council. We 
talked about it on the first floor of the Presidency on 24 
March. The government made the proposal to form a national 
economic and social planning council to draft a development plan 
for at least the next five years. Once we have a plan for 1995, 
1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999, the next government will be forced 
to continue with that plan. We would be talking about cattle, 
tourism, coffee, nontraditional products, industry, commerce, 
and municipal development, as well as water, electricity, and 
telephone service. We are currently sending to the groups that 
participated in the 24 March meeting a questionnaire to have 
them answer how they think this national council should be 
formed, how many people should participate, who should 
participate, how often it should meet, and so on. The purpose 
of this effort is to see whether we can hold the first session 
in the next two months. [end recording] 
  Although there is overall acceptance of this initiative, 
there is marked skepticism. 
  [Begin recording] [Engineer Alfredo Cesar, former National 
Assembly president] I believe it is a positive initiative, 
however, I am not so sure whether it is feasible because we have 
opposite viewpoints. 
  [National Coffee Commission President David Robleto] This is 
difficult. You know that every government and every political 
party makes different promises when election time comes. It 
will be difficult for a basic agreement of principles on the 
development of this country to be adopted by a party. [end 
recording] 
  The first agreement to be reached will be economic in nature 
and will not violate the Constitution, according to Cosep 
President Ramiro Gurdian. 
  [Begin Gurdian recording] An economic agreement is possible. 
We are very excited about that. We have to start working so 
that we can come up with the rules of the game for the next five 
years. [end recording] 
  With the creation of a national council, we will be opening 
a 
new forum of political debates with which we are going to be 
able to promote economic development based on a national 
agreement that will be in effect for at least five years.

  [Text] Panama City, 2 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The Democratic 
Revolutionary Party [PRD] reported today, Monday, that a 
policeman tried to shoot presidential candidate Ernesto Perez 
Balladares with a pistol. The man, who is in custody, said he 
drew the gun to fend off an assault. 
  The PRD, an opposition party, issued a communique describing 
the incident as "a foiled attempt" on Perez Balladares, whom 
opinion polls show as the favorite in next Sunday's general 
elections. 
  Electoral Tribunal Magistrate Dennis Allen, however, said 
the 
policeman, whom the PRD identified as Maritime Service Corporal 
Juan Bautista Zapata, said after being detained that he was just 
trying to repel an attacker who assaulted him while he was 
attending the PRD rally in downtown Panama City. Bautista 
Zapata was wearing civilian clothes at the time of the incident.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Guillermo Endara during a ceremony </F>
transferring command of the Public Force to the Electoral 
Tribunal from the National Theater in Panama City--live] 
  [Text] Mr. Vice President of the Republic; state ministers; 
comptroller; attorney general; honorable magistrates of the 
Electoral Tribunal; honorable magistrates of the Supreme Court; 
vice ministers; directors and subdirectors of autonomous and 
semiautonomous institutions; governors; mayor; members of the 
diplomatic corps; directors and subdirectors of the Public 
Force; members of the Justice and Peace Commission; electoral 
delegates; representatives of the political parties; national 
and foreign media representatives; ladies and gentlemen: 
  As a Panamanian I have always loved my fatherland with the 
firm feeling my parents instilled in me since I was a child. 
Later, as an adult, this feeling was nourished by the teachings 
of my tutor, Arnulfo Arias Madrid. Also, there is no situation 
that intensifies patriotism more than being exiled, finding 
oneself forced to be far from one's homeland. I have 
experienced this situation twice, the first when I was seven 
years old. 
  I have always been convinced as an attorney of the 
irreplaceable value of the existence of the state of law as a 
foundation for stability and social development. I have 
defended throughout my life as a politician the moral principle 
that sovereignty resides with the people; consequently, it is 
only the people's will, which is a manifestation of divine will, 
from which the authorities' origin and reason for being stem. 
  As constitutional president of the Republic, I have always 
wanted the best for my fellow countrymen. Despite the 
limitations, we have achieved an impressive material and 
institutional growth over a short period, while it was estimated 
in 1989 we would need at least a 10-year period to achieve what 
we have. Above all, as president I have considered as my 
primary duty ensuring that all citizens have the right to vote 
freely. These considerations on the whole serve to explain the 
significance of this act. 
  This is not a mere symbolic event. For the first time in 
our republican history the president of the Republic, by virtue 
of his powers, cedes to the Electoral Tribunal the command of 
the Public Force, thus complying with the guidelines established 
for the electoral process. This healthy measure was proposed by 
the executive branch and adopted by the Legislative Assembly, 
and it has been incorporated into the current Electoral Code. 
It is for the purpose of guaranteeing Panamanian voters pure 
elections, free from any shadow of undue influence. 
  Gentlemen, directors, officers, and Public Force members, as 
supreme chief of the Panamanian Public Force and abiding by 
existing laws, I hereby notify you that as of this moment and 
until the proclamation of the president-elect of the Republic, 
you are under the command of the Electoral Tribunal for all 
purposes that will guarantee the freedom, honesty, and integrity 
of the 8 May elections. 
  Honorable magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal, please 
receive command of the Panamanian Public Force for the above 
mentioned purposes, and with it you receive the guarantee you 
have full authority and full responsibility. In addition, 
receive the assurances the men and women under your command as 
of today will know how to fully comply with the historic tasks 
you are assuming. 
  I want to give one final message to my fellow countrymen. I 
said five years ago the world is watching us. I quoted that 
from the Communal Action anthem. Today, that is as true as 
before. 
  Our fatherland needs for the culmination of the electoral 
campaign on election day and the subsequent vote count to 
develop in an atmosphere of peace, order, and harmony. 
  The people's inherent enthusiasm can take place within a 
framework of civic spirit and respect for each other and the 
authorities. Nothing could contribute more to improve Panama's 
image before the international community than the massive and 
orderly turnout of citizens to a democratic, clean, and peaceful 
process. 
  May God enlighten us in the upcoming days with the brilliant 
light of His eternal wisdom so that everything will be for the 
fatherland's well-being and progress. Thank you. [applause]

  [Editorial report] Panama City Radio Network in Spanish at 
1517 GMT on 29 April broadcasts a live relay of a news 
conference held by President Guillermo Endara with domestic 
reporters in Panama City. The news conference was convened to 
announce an increase in long-distance telephone rates in Panama 
effective 1 May. 
  The director of the telephone company (INTEL), in opening 
the 
news conference, outlines the rate increase. 
  At 1525 GMT, the microphone is ceded to Endara who, 
commenting on several journalists' recent requests for 
interviews, says: "I told them that I would not agree to 
interviews, particularly in view of the large number of 
international journalists interested in seeing me. I told them 
I am not the star of this election process and that therefore 
they should not regard me as such in their coverage of it. On 
election day I will be just another voter. 
  "I intend to make a public statement. In fact, I am making 
one now, which I have been preparing for a long time. 
  "A very important event will take place on 2 May. For the 
first time in the history of Panama's popular elections, the 
Executive will vest its authority in the Electoral Tribunal. 
This concept was tested, so to speak, during the referendum, 
and it worked fine. This is provided for in the law and has been 
so ordered by the Executive. This has been approved by the 
Assembly and will be enforced. We hope all future governments 
will do the same. 
  "So I will make statements on 2 May. I will talk to you 
people on election day wherever I happen to be, and respond to 
any questions. The 8 May elections will be very special. 
  "Some of you might wonder if we are doing this because the 
elections will be held in a few days. No, gentlemen. In my 
speech at the National Theater, where we pledged to hold pure 
and honest elections, I said that although I would not be the 
star of the election process, I would continue to work in the 
government as usual, that I would suspend nothing, that I would 
continue to work as usual until 1 September. I said that the 
fact that elections were going to be held did not entail 
suspending our work and being idle. I will keep working because 
I have pledged to work for the people until 1 September. So 
this measure is not the result of a political decision, but the 
result of a work done by INTEL for over two years." 
  At 1529 GMT, Endara goes on to discuss the decision to sell 
various government assets in the Colon Free Zone, the need to 
develop all assets of the Panamanian people to ensure 
development, and his intention to return to private practice as 
a lawyer after his presidential term ends. 
  The 29-minute news conference ends at 1546 GMT, at which 
point the relay ends.

<F P=106> [Statement by Panamanian presidential candidate Ernesto </F>
Perez Balladares of the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) 
during the final presidential "debate" sponsored by the Latin 
American Institute of Advanced Study and the Media Presidential 
Debate Committee; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] My fellow countrymen, the presidential campaign is 
nearly over. To me, this has not been simply a three-month-long 
campaign but, rather, a campaign of many years that included 
frequent journeys throughout the country. It began by sharing 
the country's problems; later, by examining its most pressing 
needs; and now, by presenting government proposals that 
originate from an unwavering, firm, and sincere premise that 
there will be no hatred, no settling of scores, no retaliation, 
and no persecution. I am committed to conducting an all-out and 
unwavering war against unemployment, because, to me, economic 
growth means nothing if, at the same time, the population is not 
able to satisfy its most basic needs. What use is there in 
honoring international commitments if there are thousands of 
Panamanians who at one time enjoyed potable water but today are 
deprived of it, or only have access to it during the early 
morning hours? 
  It is impossible for me to agree that everything has 
improved 
in Panama simply because a number of skyscrapers have been 
built, especially if at the same time there is an increase in 
the number of homeless children begging for money at every 
streetlight, dropping out of schools, or getting involved in 
crime. I am unmoved by figures that only reflect the opulence 
of the few, when the majority of people are blocked from any 
advancement. 
  We have prepared an integrated, coherent, and ambitious 
program. Moreover, not one sector of the population has been 
left out. The program includes a respectable retirement for 
those who have already fulfilled their share of sacrifice and 
service. It also includes hope for members of the younger 
generation who are about to enter the workforce, for those who 
live in turbulent and chaotic urban centers, and for those who 
prefer to live in the countryside. This program is intended to 
once again return the nation to all of us, without exclusion, 
retaliation, and discrimination, allowing the best and brightest 
find a place in government service without first having to pass 
through the appalling bureaucratic quota screening and political 
party distribution system. 
  I feel very sad when a youngster has to drop out of school 
to 
help his mother support his younger brothers. I would prefer 
that this did not happen. Also, I do not want to see parents 
sacrificing everything -- recreation, enjoyment, and, in many 
instances, food itself -- just to be able to send their children 
to school, knowing beforehand that when they graduate they will 
not find a job. 
  I feel very sad when I read that Panama has become a country 
with ever-increasing violent crime, or that, as a nation, we are 
being linked to corruption. This situation cannot be resolved 
by merely strengthening the police, because the problem does not 
lie there. Panamanians turn to crime because they have lost all 
hope of finding a good job, or because corruption pays better 
than honest work. I am a firm believer in punishing criminals, 
but I am also a believer in their rehabilitation. Nevertheless, 
I believe in combating crime by combating the roots of crime. 
Therefore, we must treat those youngsters on drugs, while drug 
traffickers and money launderers must be punished without 
flinching. At the same time, we must prevent Panamanian 
households from disintegrating and prevent others from following 
the same course. 
  I am also seeking to have all Panamanians once again feel 
proud of having the country represented in a dignified manner in 
all international forums. We have been the object of ridicule 
for too many years, as if in Panama we fall short of being 
reputable. My wife and I would like to lift the Presidency of 
the Republic to a place of responsibility and reliability -- a 
place the country demands and deserves. We would like to see 
all Panamanians measured by the maturity of our society and not 
by our politicians' whims. 
  My fellow countrymen, in countering my proposals my 
adversaries have spared no slander or insults. As part of that 
mudslinging campaign, they have not even left my wife, 
daughters, or my elderly parents unscathed. Nevertheless, I 
said it at the beginning of the campaign, and I can again say it 
proudly at the end: Not one single insult against any candidate 
will be heard from me. Consistent with this conduct, you can be 
sure that my family and I have forgiven our detractors. We have 
turned away from that black cloud of politics, and we are 
preparing to build a better future for all Panamanians. 
  The past -- the distant as well as the recent past -- must 
stay behind us forever. There is no possibility whatsoever of 
returning to militarism. On this, I have given my word, and all 
of those who accompanied me during the campaign are committed to 
this. Most of all, those who will accompany me as part of the 
government are committed to this. The Panama of the future, the 
Panama of hope, cannot be built on the swamps of recrimination 
and hatred. We seek to build it on the solid ground of harmony 
and respect for the opinions of others. We are seeking to build 
it with a team completely divorced from political affiliation or 
party quotas -- a team comprising men and women committed only 
to the country and of whom we demand just two things: honesty 
and efficiency. That is why all -- I repeat -- all Panamanians 
know who represents their final hope.

<F P=106> [Statement by presidential candidate Ruben Blades of the </F>
Papa Egoro Movement during the final presidential "debate" 
sponsored by the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies 
and the Media Presidential Debate Committee; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Some 90 years ago, at the beginning of a new 
century, Panamanians adopted with patriotism and courage the 
decision to forge a new nation. Today, nearly 100 years later, 
Panama is preparing for another important historical event -- 
the country's entrance into the 21st century. The government we 
will elect on Sunday will be responsible for preparing and 
implementing a national program that will allow us to enter the 
21st century ready to participate and compete advantageously. 
We must resolve the current crisis; we must strengthen our 
institutional, cultural, economic, political, and moral values; 
and we must begin the construction of a new country capable of 
facing the challenges of a new century. 
  To achieve these goals, the new government will have to work 
with the greatest degree of honesty, dedication, and patriotism, 
and it will have to work with only one goal -- to serve Panama. 
For this reason, it is vital that the executive branch not be 
controlled by private interests that are represented by the 
leadership of the traditional political parties. The bosses of 
these parties do not differ from one another. All of them have 
betrayed their own rank-and-file, and they have also betrayed 
the ideals of their original leaders. See how today, given the 
actual possibility that decency may win, they are uniting to 
attack us in a shameful campaign of lies and infamy. Let us 
start putting things in their rightful order, because we will 
not let them insult the intelligence of our nation's men and 
women. 
  The same conceit and arrogance that prevented them from 
seeing the nation's problems have also prevented them from 
recognizing the balanced proposals of the Papa Egoro Movement. 
Moreover, they were unable to foresee the consequences of their 
blindness. Now that the people's wisdom has bested them and the 
Panamanian people are overwhelmingly supporting a new and 
different program, they have been unable to find arguments that 
enable them to fight fairly. 
  In this immoral campaign, which I suppose will continue 
until 
Election Day, I am being accused of being a CIA agent, of being 
a communist, of trying to change the currency, of being a 
hireling of the military, of using drugs, and of many other 
things, and all of these accusations are made without evidence 
or are based on false or forged evidence. I assure you, honest 
men and women of my country, that all of this is part of a plan 
to cause confusion and undermine our movement's support. It is 
all a lie. They want you to believe that the option of decency 
has no possibility of winning, as well as believe that, in these 
elections, you can only choose between two options which 
represent the past and which have squandered the best 
opportunities Panama ever had. 
  We, on the other hand, propose a government that will be 
honored and proud to work for our country and will also exalt 
all of us in order that we may recover the feelings of national 
pride which glorify a nation. The government we propose 
includes capable professionals who come from all social, 
political, and labor groups in Panama. They are people with 
vast professional experience, noble qualities, and whose 
leadership is based on merit. This government team will set an 
example of unity and tolerance among brothers, honesty, 
creativity, goodwill, independence, national pride, ability, 
imagination, and all of the good qualities of the Panamanian 
people. 
  This is what we need in order that, when the Canal is handed 
over to the Panamanian people, the reverted areas do not become 
political loot for irresponsible individuals capable of 
sacrificing a whole country to satisfy their material ambitions. 
Let us remember that the Canal is not simply an important 
economic resource; it is a responsibility shared by all 
Panamanians before the entire world. The seriousness of its 
management will determine the amount of respect we receive 
within the international community. 
  The Papa Egoro Movement has stated and repeated many times 
that it is necessary to change the Panamanians' political 
conduct so that their participation in the government may become 
a true civic goal. I agree with the school of thought that 
defines the failure of traditional politics as the failure of 
men and women whose moral corruption has been unmasked by power, 
or who have been compelled to accept corruption to achieve a 
covetous share of power. 
  We have to make an effort -- all of us, together, all social 
and economic groups, the rank-and-file of all political parties, 
and all ethnic groups -- to elect and support a government that 
makes a change. I am confident we will achieve this, because 
the Panamanians who are responsible, decent, and prepared to 
work for a better country represent the majority. This 
determination to solve our problems and establish the groundwork 
to enable Panama to begin to change must be clearly stated at 
the ballot boxes as an exemplary civic duty. 
  I congratulate those who will vote for their candidates, not 
because they will get a sinecure or a job, or as a result of 
vengeance and retribution, but because they are convinced by 
their proposals and because they believe in those men and women. 
The electoral challenge we now face is a struggle between hope 
and failure, between an honest political position and politics 
for the sake of politics, between the desire to honor the 
homeland and the desire for personal gain, between the future 
and the past, and between honesty and corruption. 
  Let us go out and win this battle for the sake of Panama, 
for 
the sake of our highest thoughts, for the sake of our finest 
feelings, and for the sake of honesty. I am asking the 
Panamanians to go out and vote and unequivocally state that we 
all want true change, and I am asking them not to let money and 
false promises prevail when they make their decision. This 
time, please, listen to your consciences and hearts. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Statement by presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles of </F>
the Change '94 Alliance during the final presidential "debate" 
sponsored by the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies 
and the Media Presidential Debate Committee; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow Citizens: Throughout my speeches during this 
electoral campaign, I have reiterated that the 8 May elections 
will be the most important in our country's history. Our future 
and that of the coming generations depend on these elections. 
Our campaign is based in reality, not false illusions. Our 
promises are based on experience, on our team's ability, and on 
what we know we can do. False promises with the selfish 
objective of winning votes are not part of my personality, nor 
those of vice presidential candidates Guillermo Quijano or Tomas 
Herrera. It is simply dishonest to make false promises. 
  We live in a world of realities with real problems that 
demand solutions which our young associates can provide. Our 
reality is clear. Panama must overcome the present to guarantee 
the future. Panama cannot be prosperous so long as we have 
children going to school hungry. We cannot tolerate that. Our 
young people must have opportunities and effective educations so 
our country can develop. Our country needs young people who are 
strong both physically and spiritually. Those characteristics 
require an education that instills a guiding light in the souls 
of our youths. 
  Panama is a country with potential, and we will turn that 
potential into realities to be enjoyed by all Panamanians. To 
achieve this, we need a capable government that will make the 
necessary decisions; a government that will make decisions 
honestly; a government that knows what it is doing; a government 
that will energetically make decisions and implement them 
efficiently. 
  That is why the government that we will establish following 
the 8 May elections will be made up of men and women who have 
the know-how ability, honesty, and experience to make and 
implement those decisions. You are familiar with these people 
because they are not unknowns, nor have we kept them hidden. 
You see them around me all the time because they have attended 
all kinds of political events. It is a disgrace that in Panama, 
a country with the potential to be wealthy, a majority of the 
population is still poor, and too great a percentage of the 
population currently lives with so many scarcities. 
  More than 90 years ago, Panama optimistically entered the 
community of free, sovereign nations. When it achieved that 
freedom and sovereignty, it hopefully announced that it had 
finally reached victory through unity. That is why we are now 
astonished to hear some people doubt that we are going to find 
the path that will lead us to the fatherland about which 
[Panamanian poet and writer] Ricardo Miro wrote. 
  President Lincoln, the same person who spoke about 
government 
of the people, by the people, and for the people, also said that 
when the people are kept well informed, the nation is safe. 
That is why when the people exercise their right to elect 
government leaders, they also have every right to have access to 
all the information they need, without exception, to make an 
intelligent vote, in full knowledge of what they are doing and 
obeying only the dictates of their conscience and an analysis of 
the records of those whom they choose to support. 
  Today, in the last phase of the activities promoted by ILDEA 
[Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies] in the electoral 
process, I must point out that these activities were unable to 
promote an analysis of the problems and the solutions proposed 
by the candidates. The analysis was made on the basis of 
questions that led to ambiguous answers which did not permit a 
differentiation between the truth and falsehoods. Panamanians 
have not had a real opportunity to evaluate the proposals, 
plans, and programs of the candidates through an in-depth 
analysis. The vice presidents on my ticket asked for debates 
with the other vice presidential candidates. Debates were not 
held at that level. 
  Nevertheless, the people are wise despite all the 
limitations, and on 8 May they will elect their future leaders. 
It is their opportunity to find the lost path. The decision is 
up to the people and only the people. I know my fellow citizens 
will not make a mistake, because their hopes for a better future 
now depend on their decision, no one else's. We of the Change 
'94 alliance offer a real, innovative, and valuable change to 
once and for all achieve real victory for all Panamanians. For 
this purpose, fellow citizens, give us your vote. We are the 
best ticket, individually and collectively. Back us with your 
vote, which is what the country needs.

<F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The latest CID [Multispecialty Development 
Counselors]-Gallup poll indicates that the majority of votes in 
the upcoming presidential election will be split between Ernesto 
Perez Balladares of the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] and 
Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement. If the presidential 
election had been held between 25 and 29 April, 30 percent of 
Panamanian voters would have voted for Perez Balladares, 26 
percent for Ruben Blades, 17 percent for Mireya Moscoso de 
Gruber, 14 percent for Ruben Carles, 2 percent for Eddy 
Vallarino, 1 percent for Samuel Lewis Galindo, 1 percent for 
Jose Salvador Munoz, and 9 percent were undecided or preferred 
not to answer. 
  These results were based on 1,200 interviews. In the report, 
the CID-Gallup pollsters noted that, bearing in mind the rapid 
increase in support for Ruben Blades, they were unable to 
predict one week before the elections whether Ruben Blades or 
Perez Balladares would win. According to the polling firm, 
Perez Balladares' lead is larger than the 3-percent margin of 
error, but only slightly. 
  In the latest CID-Gallup poll, one's attention is drawn to 
the difference in the support by region of the country for both 
Perez Balladares and Ruben Blades. In the survey, Perez 
Balladares had a support rating of 31 percent in the 
metropolitan area and 29 percent in the rest of the country for 
a total of 30 percent. Ruben Blades, meanwhile, had 33 percent 
in the metropolitan area and 18 percent in the rest of the 
country for a total of 26 percent. Blades has a 2-percent lead 
over Perez Balladares in the metropolitan area, while Perez 
Balladares has an 11-percent lead over Blades in the rest of the 
country. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the number of votes for 
each region, Perez Balladares has a 4-point lead over Blades at 
the nationwide level. The margin of error is 3 percent. 
  In the trends section of the report, CID-Gallup indicates 
that in the March-April period, Perez Balladares registered a 
slight 3-percent drop, while Blades registered a 14-percent 
increase. CID- Gallup comments that if this trend continues, 
singer Ruben Blades could end up the winner. 
  CID-Gallup ends its report by stating: We oppose the 
restrictions imposed by electoral tribunals on conducting polls 
and releasing their results just prior to Election Day, as is 
the case in Panama. According to CID-Gallup, it is clear that 
the situation could change in the final week before the 
elections, and it will be impossible to report the trends during 
this final week to the public.

  [Text] Panama maintains good commercial relations with the 
EU (European Union), although there have been some differences 
regarding some products. This was announced by Commerce and 
Industry Minister Ricardo Fabrega. 
  Although the EU has imposed certain restrictions on our 
country, on products such as bananas, seafood, and fish, 
Commerce and Industry Minister Ricardo Fabrega said multilateral 
commercial relations are at a very high level. A ruling is 
pending in the case of bananas. 
  [Begin Fabrega recording] Within those commercial relations 
we have some differences of opinion, such as on the topic of 
bananas. We have established mechanisms of communication, 
however, and have announced our position. Certain countries of 
the EU support our stand, and this is being defined by a 
tribunal. We expect a ruling will favor our decision sometime 
around October. [end recording] 
  In the case of seafood, Panama will make certain 
modifications so as to later resume commercial relations with 
European countries on this product. 
  [Begin Fabrega recording] In the Athens meeting, we held 
some 
meetings with ranking EU officials. They explained what gave 
rise to the problem with seafood in terms of the rules of origin 
of the seafood. We were able to reach a very satisfactory 
agreement on such rules. We think that within a very short time 
our seafood products will enter the European market duty free.

  [Text] Cochabamba, 19 Apr (PRESENCIA) -- The increasing use 
of drugs is converting Bolivia from a producing country to a 
consuming country because "drug addiction is unfortunately 
consolidating itself in the country." 
  This comment was made by Rolando Camacho Pena, director of 
the Council for the Comprehensive Prevention of Drug Abuse, 
Treatment, and Rehabilitation, Copre. He stated that drug 
addiction affects students in particular. He said: "For this 
reason the greatest part of our effort and work is directed 
toward that section of the population." 
  He reported that in 1990 a study was made on drug 
consumption 
among high school and university freshmen students. The study 
revealed that the national average was 12.82 percent and that 
the most affected departments were Santa Cruz and Cochabamba 
with 16.39 and 16.35 percent respectively. He said: "This leads 
to the conclusion that the prevention program at the school 
level must be strengthened." The first Copre publication on 
epidemiological studies explains drug addiction trends and 
behavior patterns. 
  Camacho said: "Unfortunately the trend shows that drug 
addiction among students is increasing. This means students are 
consuming more drugs, they are more involved in drug 
consumption." 
  The study, conducted by the Bolivian Red Cross in 1986, 
showed that drug addiction was 10.32 percent. This increased to 
12.82 percent in 1992. Habitual consumption [consumo habitual] 
increased from 1.6 to 2.65 percent from 1986 to 1990. Camacho 
added: "The problem is constantly increasing." 
  Camacho indicated that the studies will now be conducted 
every two years because "the problem is so serious that we need 
to study addiction trends and be alert for a possible epidemic 
that could have catastrophic consequences for our students." 
  The drugs that are consumed most include the so-called legal 
drugs -- alcohol and tobacco -- which form "a bridge" to the use 
of other illegal drugs like cocaine and marijuana "which 
seriously affect the health of the young."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Money `Laundering' in Bolivia"] </F>
  [Text] Whether we like it or not, the laundering of 
dollars, national currency, or any foreign currency is not a 
crime in Bolivia. To be a crime it would have to be 
specifically described as "antijuridical conduct" either in the 
Penal Code or in a law such as the frightful and now repudiated 
Law 1008. Oddly enough, neither those in the U.S. Embassy nor 
their Bolivian counterparts who implement draconian measures 
included such conduct in that law, and therefore it is not 
characterized as a crime. 
  Perhaps the reason for this is the fact that the 
"laundering," which is also called "whitewashing," is impossible 
to keep under control in a financial and monetary system like 
ours, where there are no restrictions for converting our 
currency, or where no question is asked about who makes deposits 
or withdrawals in bank accounts for any type of currency. The 
other ways of finding out (through legal means, and not through 
intimidation, blackmail, or physical or psychological torture) 
if a transaction is voluntarily linked to a crime are also 
impossible. For example, how can you incriminate the apostolic 
vicariate in a Santa Cruz Province that 10 years ago sold a 
cattle ranch in its ownership to an individual who is now being 
accused of drug trafficking? 
  There are many examples, and the introduction of controls to 
prevent the undesirable laundering can do nothing more than 
obstruct the normal flow of financial operations. In reality, 
what Law 1008 establishes is the investigation of wealth, and in 
this way trace whether an individual accumulated wealth through 
illegal activities such as drug trafficking. This should be 
extended to other individuals to find out whether there were 
cases of embezzlement or corruption in the public administration.

CSO 

  [Text] The proposed Popular Participation Law, which 
according to the government will bring development to rural 
areas, is seen by Miguel Urioste, the deputy of the government 
party, as a juridical instrument that will liberate the 
indigenous peoples. In the opinion of Fernando Untoja, leader of 
the National Katarist Movement (MKN), the new law will serve 
only to register and allocate the land. The head of the CSUTCB 
[General Trade Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of 
Bolivia], Felix Santos, says that "what the administration wants 
with its proposal is the support of the peasants to hegemonize 
power." 
  Despite the fact that the indigenous peasant represents more 
than 54 percent of the nation's population, integration into the 
economic, political, and social life of the country has always 
been an unresolved problem because of the social development and 
structure in Bolivia from its founding up to the present. 
  After 169 years of life as a republic, economic and 
political 
power is still denied to those persons who, for more than 500 
years, have demanded the ownership of their lands, usurped in 
their opinion by "European invaders and their heirs, who today 
enjoy impunity in the command levels of the state." 
  The recent misfortune of the indigenous peoples, in the 
national and continental contexts, and the social injustice in 
which they live, was the motivation, according to government 
representatives, for the preparation of a law that would channel 
the sense of participation that the "people" have always had, 
Popular Participation. 
  The sentiment and the logic with which the administration 
rationalizes its proposed law is described by Miguel Urioste, 
national deputy of the Free Bolivia Movement (MBL), as a 
redistribution of the state's resources in order to encourage 
rural development. 
  "It is the first time in the country's history that 20 
percent of tax revenues will have been transferred to the 
provinces, cantons, and communities through the sectional 
townships," said Urioste, referring to the projections for 
peasant development. 
  Fernando Untoja, presidential candidate for the National 
Katarist Movement (MKN) in last June's general election, 
believes, however, that the Popular Participation Law will not 
further social development, much less the economic strengthening 
of rural areas, because it does not contain a comprehensive 
agricultural policy. 
  "The Popular Participation project has a single virtue: it 
is 
designed to register territories and communities, which in the 
end will come down to the administration of schools, health 
stations, and other public facilities, through the 
municipalities and subprefectures," Untoja said. 
  There is still another view. In the opinion of Felix Santos, 
executive secretary of the CSUTCB, the Popular Participation Law 
is a plan that will commercialize land ownership, impoverishing 
the peasants even more. 
  "How can there be economic development and progress in rural 
areas when the administration itself has in mind to create land 
banks and institutes that will establish new rural taxes which 
logically further impoverish the peasants?" questioned the union 
leader, who is of Quechua origin. 
  A subject that concerns Fernando Untoja, who recently 
proposed an alternative plan to Popular Participation, is the 
law's lack of ideas and specific articles related to the 
economic development of rural areas. These are areas that suffer 
from a lack of markets for their products, and the fact that 
agricultural technology has not reached rural areas. 
  This thought was further developed by Santos, to whom it 
seemed "totally incoherent" that the government proposal did not 
take into account the economic progress of the indigenous 
peoples. Worse yet, it wanted to eliminate education and health 
services, transferring them gradually to the municipalities. 
  "I do not believe that the reallocation of the budget will 
aid the development of rural areas, especially when the money 
will come out of the pockets of impoverished urban families and 
of the peasants themselves, while wealthy businessmen will 
continue to benefit from our labor," he emphasized. 
  Urioste, vice presidential candidate for the MBL in 1993, 
defended the government's proposal, saying that "this is just 
the beginning" of a series of changes that, in the long run, 
will restructure a state that still preserves hidden forms of 
colonial domination and ethnic-cultural exclusion. 
  Urioste recognized that juridical equality for Bolivians, 
embodied this time in the Popular Participation Law, will not be 
sufficient to close the immense gap that exists between the 
poverty of rural areas and the opulence of the privileged social 
sectors in the cities. 
  "We must keep in mind that this is an important plan but not 
the final one. I believe that this juridical instrument will, in 
a sense, initiate the liberation of the indigenous peoples," 
Urioste said. 
  In Santos's opinion, the worst thing that could happen to a 
poor person is to be a peasant, without access to political and 
economic power, without any real opportunity to take part in 
governing the state. 
  "We believe that one of the ways that rural areas can be 
developed is to transfer the administration of natural resources 
to the indigenous peoples, so that the proceeds of the 
exploitation of these resources can be administered autonomously 
by the people of the regions that produce them," said Santos. 
  The peasant leader's suggestion was converted by Untoja into 
an alternative proposal that was recently presented to Congress. 
  That document proposes drawing the indigenous peoples' 
tribal 
organizations into the state, which might even make possible a 
new system of national departments, based on Bolivia's 
ecological zones and ecosystems. 
  The most important feature of "Untoja's Katarist" 
alternative 
lies in the state's real ability to distribute land to the 
peasants. 
  "The current Popular Participation Law makes no provision 
for 
granting land to the peasants, which in this situation is the 
most important element for a takeoff in agricultural 
development, which is certainly not to be confused with the 
Basic Territorial Organizations (OTB's)." 
  Santos and Untoja, the latter of Aymara origin, agree in 
saying that the official document is political in content and 
has as its ultimate end taking possession of the rural sector 
and municipalizing it by means of the committees of vigilance. 
  "The government's aim in forming the committees of vigilance 
is obvious. These committees will be taken over by movement 
groups which will set aside and leave powerless the popular and 
communitary organizations of workers and indigenous peoples," 
the principal leader of the CSUTCB charged. 
  "This is evident. The ayllus, cabildos, jilikatas, curacas 
[presumably governing or representative bodies of the Indian 
nations] and other communitary organizations will have to give 
up their places to the committees of vigilance, which 
necessarily will be vouched for by the subprefectures, and in 
the final analysis these committees will do the screening of the 
OTB's representatives," said Untoja. 
  But Urioste, the number two man in the social democratic 
MBL, 
defends the project, saying that "the peasants' ability to 
choose, decide, and to administer should not be underestimated." 
  "I am certain that there will be no political infiltration 
in 
the committees of vigilance because they will not be handpicked 
but will be chosen by each community's individual system," said 
Urioste. 
  However, in Untoja's opinion the government sector already 
has a juridical instrument that "will legalize" political 
conditioning for each electoral event. 
  "For example, the community that does not agree with the 
government's political line simply will not receive resources to 
run its schools or health stations. This fact will produce 
divisions in the communities and ayllus, which will fight to be 
legally recognized," Untoja predicted. 
  In any event, and from different perspectives, Untoja, as 
well as Santos and Urioste, already knows that the new law will 
not produce an immediate economic takeoff in agriculture, 
although the MBL leader nourishes a certain hope.

  [Excerpt] Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange 
yesterday asked Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma for two 
months' leave without pay after the leave permit he is currently 
enjoying expires. Minister Perez accepted the request. 
  This information was disclosed by the Defense Ministry in a 
brief communique of four and a half lines. 
  General Stange will thus remain outside the Carabineros 
institution for another 60 days after his leave permit is over. 
  It should be recalled that Defense Minister Perez Yoma had 
stated in Concepcion that Stange's vacation was for an 
"indefinite" period of time. 
  Carabineros Deputy Director Fernando Cordero Rusque is 
currently carrying out Stange's duties in his place. 
  Stange went on leave after special Judge Milton Juica 
condemned 16 Carabineros officers and one civilian to sentences 
ranging from 61 days to life imprisonment for the abduction and 
murder of communist leaders Jose Manuel Parada, Manuel Guerrero, 
and Santiago Natino, for the abduction of several leaders of the 
former Agech [Chilean Educators Association], for the abduction 
of Ramon Arriagada, the wounding of professor Leopoldo Munoz de 
la Parra with a bullet, and for the unlawful association for 
terrorist purposes, among other crimes. 
  After Judge Juica's ruling was disclosed, President Eduardo 
Frei met on 5 April with Stange at La Moneda Palace. Frei 
allegedly asked Stange to resign, but at the end of the meeting 
the Carabineros director said: "I am not resigning." 
  On 8 April Stange went on leave, which prompted a polemic 
between the Carabineros and the government. According to the 
Carabineros, Stange was taking a regular 30 day vacation, while 
the government maintained he would be on leave for an 
"indefinite" period of time. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Through the publication of a decree in the official 
gazette yesterday, the Foreign Ministry promulgated an agreement 
with Jamaica for the prevention, control, surveillance, and 
repression of the illegal consumption and trafficking of drugs 
and narcotics. 
  The agreement is signed by former President Patricio Aylwin. 
It was approved by Congress as stated in Resolution No. 1280 of 
the Chamber of Deputies. 
  The two governments are aware of the problems stemming from 
drugs, including the deterioration of economies and the harm to 
peoples' health. 
  The idea is to establish a permanent mechanism that will 
allow Chilean and Jamaican authorities to exchange information 
related to drug trafficking.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Foreign Ministry in response to </F>
U.S. Senator John Kerry's protest note; place and date not given 
-- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Colombian Government, although it disagrees with 
the prosecutor general on some points, cannot accept whatsover 
doubts are being cast on its motives or its determined and 
unchanging commitment to reach the common goal of fighting crime 
in general and fighting drug trafficking in particular. In 
addition, the Colombian Government, because it believes the 
necessary climate of constructive understanding between the two 
governments is not being served, flatly rejects the fact that a 
political leader, in this instance Senator John Kerry, has used 
his post and the post's inherent prerogatives, such as the 
legislative branch's political control procedures, to grant 
privileges to, listen to, and believe false charges by a 
confessed criminal against Colombia, its institutions, the 
private sector, and even the media. Such a position represents 
an attack on Colombian society and its authorities because it 
casts a shadow of suspicion and implies corruption, or at least 
general complicity with drug traffickers, in a country which is 
well-known to have made the greatest possible sacrifices and 
which has achieved the greatest results in the struggle against 
this scourge. 
  The Colombian Government expects that judicial cooperation 
between the two countries can return to normal and that the 
channels of dialogue, exchange of ideas, and joint work between 
judicial authorities of the two countries can be kept open. To 
achieve this, the best possible joint efforts should be made to 
overcome any disagreements resulting from the difficulties 
inherent in the handling of such a complex matter. 
  Finally, the Colombian Foreign Ministry wants to underscore 
the importance of cooperation because the absence of this can 
benefit only our common enemies -- those interested in fanning 
the fires of discord and (?putting obstacles) in the path of 
justice. 
  [Signed] Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Vladimiro Naranjo, magistrate of </F>
the Colombian Constitutional Court, by unidentified station 
announcer; place not given; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" 
newscast--live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Good morning, Dr. Naranjo. Would you 
explain the procedures that will be followed in the 
Constitutional Court in terms of juridical control following the 
state of internal disturbance the government decreed yesterday 
to prevent an important group of dangerous narcotraffickers and 
others charged with subversion and terrorism from leaving prison? 
  [Naranjo] The procedure is established in the Constitution. 
Decrees that acquire the status of legislative decrees the 
government issues in exercising Article 213 are passed to the 
Constitutional Court for review of constitutionality; it is an 
automatic review. 
  [Announcer] Can the Constitutional Court analyze reasons of 
advisability or nonadvisability? 
  [Naranjo] The Constitution is clear on attributing the 
authority to evaluate the circumstances that warrant the 
declaration of an internal disturbance to the government; in 
other words, it is the government that supposedly has the basic 
authority needed to conclude a state of internal disturbance 
must be declared whenever there is a serious disruption of 
public order, which in the government's opinion imminently 
attempts a compromise of institutional stability, state 
security, or the coexistence of citizens. The government must 
determine such elements. 
  [Announcer] How much time does the Constitutional Court have 
to make a pronouncement regarding the state of internal 
disturbance? We understand that before it does so, the Attorney 
General's Office must also state its position. Is that correct? 
  [Naranjo] Correct. The court has a regular period of 60 days 
to decide. In cases of states of internal disturbance, as in 
this case, those terms are reduced by one-third, or 20 days. As 
you noted, the Attorney General's Office must give prior 
consent. For that, there are 30 days, but by reducing this by 
one-third we are left with 10 days. 
  [Announcer] The declaration of a state of internal 
disturbance is becoming a recurrent problem to prevent dangerous 
inmates from leaving prisons. Is this due to the Prosecutor 
General's negligence or delayed action? 
  [Naranjo] I would not like to comment on that yet. As you 
can understand, we must make a pronouncement on this subject, 
but we cannot state our opinions at this time.

  [Text] Cartagena -- According to Foreign Trade Minister 
Juan Manuel Santos, if the Constitutional Court does not approve 
the investment protection treaty signed with the UK, they will 
have to reform the Constitution. In his opinion, the government 
has the necessary legal arguments to help the treaty pass the 
juridical test, and it cannot sit back with its arms crossed 
while other countries are signing investment protection 
treaties. "The new Constitution is being tested, and if the 
treaty with the UK is not approved, Colombian will be left in a 
very complicated position." 
  Santos defended the Foreign Investment Protection Agreement 
signed with the UK. He added, however, that the Shell Company 
cannot use the treaty to support its case in its conflict with 
the government over the termination of Shell's contract in 
Neiva. The oil company has already presented its legal case on 
the basis that an acquired right has been violated. The treaty 
cannot be applied to such a case. "Colombia did not yield when 
it signed the treaty with the UK. It only put the regulations 
currently in effect into one agreement to provide greater 
stability for investors," Santos added. 
<H5>  Free Commerce </H5>
  As new ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin America] 
president 
in the 25th period of sessions, Foreign Trade Minister Juan 
Manuel Santos will establish a hemispheric free trade zone, the 
inclusion of the social sector in the economic opening process, 
and the recovery of ECLA's leadership his priorities 
  According to Santos, ECLA can become a vital force to 
promote 
social development in the region. He said: "The benefits derived 
from development programs must be distributed equitably. If they 
are not, the programs lose legitimacy." 
  Approximately 200 million Latin Americans and Caribbeans 
(out 
of a total of 450 million) currently live in a state of absolute 
poverty. According to Santos, this indicates that although "the 
opening has been implemented and there are interaction 
agreements between 22 countries, the importance of the social 
sector has not been emphasized." 
  Regarding the Latin American integration agreements, Santos 
asserted that they must converge in the establishment of a free 
trade zone at the continental level, a process in which ECLA 
could play an important role. "We must confirm the agreements so 
all countries are speaking the same language. We have to find a 
common denominator for rules on the origin of merchandise and 
antidumping [previous word in English] laws, among other 
topics," Santos stated. 
  Regarding Colombia's entry into the NAFTA signed by Mexico, 
the United States, and Canada, Santos said they will leave 
everything ready for the new government to enter that group. 
"We have already agreed that Colombia is an ideal candidate to 
enter the treaty, and we want to be on the list of countries 
that will enter it first. The next administration, however, 
will set the date and the conditions for our entry," the 
minister stated. 
  On the Group of Three problems, he reported that they will 
hold a meeting next week to reach an agreement on the two areas 
that have sparked differences: rules on origin of merchandise in 
the textile and chemical sectors.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Joao Domingos] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The action by the groups that a few days 
ago impeded the approval of the government economic program has 
shown the true colors of Congress: The Brazilian Congress that 
really works is not the Congress of political parties, but the 
Congress of groups. Such groups have created big, powerful 
blocs, regardless of party membership. The rural bloc, for 
example, is twice the size of the PMBD [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party] bloc, which is the largest party in Congress. 
  The bloc of nationalist lawmakers is bigger than the rural 
bloc, and also much more pluralistic. This bloc is made up of 
leftist deputies like Haroldo Lima (PC do B) [Communist Party of 
Brazil], Ernesto Gradella (PSTU-SP) [expansion unknown-Sao 
Paulo], and PDT-RJ [Democratic Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro] to 
politicians of such diverse trends as Prisco Viana (PPR-BA) 
[Progressive Renewal Party-Bahia] and Josaphat Marinho (PFL-BA) 
[Liberal Front Party-Bahia]. The nationalist bloc has made 
unfeasible all attempts to end the monopoly of Petrobras 
[Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. All bloc members consider 
the oil sector a strategic area. 
  Whenever the interest of some of those groups is 
jeopardized, 
their members react immediately. The rural bloc has just 
prevented the approval of Provisional Measure 457 [MP 457], 
which established the URV [real value unit] as the basis of the 
government economic plan. In exchange for support for the 
Planalto Palace proposal, they demanded the pardoning of the 
debts that were contracted before the Collor plan. During the 
negotiations they obtained a promise to reschedule the debts 
over a five-year period. They rejected the promise, and 
increased their demands, because they know they can exert even 
stronger pressure. 
  "There is an excellent environment for group action in 
Congress," PFL leader in the Chamber of Deputies Luis Eduardo 
Magalhaes (Bahia) said, adding that he is against the privilege 
of such groups. Despite his position, Magalhaes joined the group 
of lawmakers who acquitted PFL Deputy for Pernambuco Ricardo 
Fiuza in the Constitution and Justice Committee. Fiuza had been 
charged with irregularities within the Budget Committee. 
  At that moment the influence of those who were indebted 
could be felt, as a large number of congressmen owe favors to 
Fiuza. 
  In the opinion of the government leader in the Chamber of 
Deputies, Luiz Carlos Santos (PMDB-SP), the growth of these 
groups "is making politics, institutions, and parties 
unfeasible." According to him, the constitutional reform was a 
failure because the groups demanded favors in exchange for the 
approval of important modifications to the Constitution. To 
make the situation worse, some blocs -- such as the rural bloc 
-- tried to introduce their demands into inappropriate 
documents, such as the text of MP 457. 
  Smaller than the nationalist and rural blocs, the Health 
Parliamentary Front unites congressmen of all ideological 
trends, and insists principally on the allocation of funds to 
hospitals that have agreements with the Health Ministry. This 
bloc joined the rural bloc and made the government decide not to 
have MP 457 voted on in a plenary session. 
  The rural bloc always reacts by defending its financial 
interests. In several cases, however, the groups gather around 
different banners, be they political or religious. The 
Protestants, a group comprised of nearly 30 congressmen, are 
always ready to fight for the reestablishment of censorship on 
all means of communication or to request favors, particularly 
the allocation of national budget funds to their churches. When 
Congress was voting on a five-year mandate for then President 
Jose Sarney, almost all Protestants were given radio stations. 
<H5>  Who Makes the Decisions in the Plenary Sessions </H5>
  The multiparty blocs that defend group interests in Congress 
are: 

  -  Nationalists -- 300 members: They affirm they have the 
majority of votes in the plenary sessions whenever issues that 
are of interest to them are being voted on. One of their main 
banners is to preserve monopolies. Their leaders are: Senator 
Josaphat Marinho (PFL-BA), and Deputies Miguel Arraes (PSDB-PE) 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Pernambuco], and Haroldo Lima 
(PC do B-BA). 
  -  Bank of Brazil -- 10 members: A small, but 
influential bloc that always obtains the support of other 
congressmen when the privileges of the official bank are at 
stake. Their leaders are: Deputies Augusto Carvalho (PPS-DF) 
[People's Socialist Party-Federal District], Paulo Bernardo 
(PT-PR) [Workers Party-Parana], and Paulo Mandarino (PPR-GO) 
[Progressive Renewal Party-Goias]. 
  -  Protestants -- 30 members: 
In the last few years they have lost some of their power, but 
whenever the issue being voted on at a plenary session refers to 
religion or behavior, they still act as a bloc. Their leaders 
are: Deputies Maviael Cavalcanti (PP-PE) [Popular Party-PE], 
Costa Ferreira (PP-MA) [PP -- Maranha], and Benedito Domingos 
(PP-DF). 
  -  Judicial Branch, Attorneys -- 10 members: Few 
congressmen come from the attorneys' offices or the judicial 
branch, but these sectors are helped by deputies interested in 
defending their issues, such as Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [PMDB-Rio 
Grande do Sul], Jose Luiz Clerot (PMDB-PB) [PMDB-Paraiba], and 
Nilson Gibson (PMN-PE) [National Mobilization Party-PE]. 
  -  Rural 
Bloc -- 206 members: It unites small and large producers in 
defense of the sector's profits. The group is headed by 
Deputies Ronaldo Caiado (PFL-GO), Odelmo Leao (PP-MG) [PP-Minas 
Gerais], and Jonas Pinheiro (PFL-MT) [PFL-Mato Grosso], as well 
as Senators Ronan Tito (PMDB-MG) and Saldanha Derzi (PRN-MS) 
[National Reconstruction Party-Mato Grosso do Sul]. 
  -  Union 
Leaders -- 30 members: Comprised mainly of leftist congressmen 
who began their political careers as members of labor unions. 
They are led by Chico Vigilante (PT-DF), Pedro Tonelli (PT-PR), 
Carlos Santana (PT-RJ), and Carlos Alberto Campista 
(PDT-RJ). 
  -  Public Administration Employees -- 10 members: 
Although they have no expressive power in Congress, their group 
makes a lot of noise in the corridors. Their main leaders are: 
"Shi'ite" Maria Laura (PT-DF) and Trotskyist Maria Luiza 
Fontenelle (PSTU-CE) [PSTU-Ceara]. 
  -  National Health Front -- 200 
members: They seek to have the widest program possible but have 
to face dissidence. A group led by Deputy Eduardo Jorge 
(PT-SP), who is a doctor, charges the front with being an 
instrument used by Chafic Farhat (PPR-SP), who defends the 
hospitals' interests.

  [Text] After three days of deliberations, the Workers Party 
[PT] ended its ninth national meeting in Brasilia. Party 
delegates formalized the designation of Luiz Inacio Lula da 
Silva as PT candidate for the presidential elections on 3 
October. 
  This is the first time the PT has adopted a more moderate 
position on the foreign debt. After the various party sectors 
reached a broad understanding, the government program 
established that a moratorium should be declared only after 
rejecting [contestar] the agreements that already have been 
approved and after negotiating with the international financial 
community. 
  Concerning abortion, the party decided that in the cases 
provided for by the law women will have the right to make use of 
public hospitals. 
  The ninth PT national meeting lasted three days. Lula said 
that despite the fact that the program does not reflect 
unanimity on some questions, the decisions were made by a 
considerable majority. He added that the war of election 
contenders will now begin, and that the PT will advocate a 
campaign without dirty practices: 
  [Begin Lula recording] I cannot engage in dirty practices. 
As 
I said at the beginning, we will not answer any mean attitude by 
our adversaries. [end recording] 
  As for the bugging of politicians' phones, Lula said he is 
not afraid of the use of such methods because he usually takes 
care of important conversations through personal contacts.

  [Text] The results of a Vox Populi Institute poll were 
published on 29 April. It shows that former President and 
Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] 
is the second most popular presidential candidate with 19 
percent of the votes. He comes behind Luis Inacio Lula da Silva 
(PT) [Workers Party], who has 30 percent. Sarney is ahead of 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party], who has 15 percent. Between 23 and 25 April, the 
institute interviewed 3,100 voters countrywide. Just 10 days 
earlier, the IBOPE [Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics 
Institute] released the results of its poll which showed Sarney 
in third place with 13 percent of the votes, Lula in first place 
with 31 percent, and Fernando Henrique Cardoso in second place 
with 16 percent. 
  Of the three PMDB pre-presidential candidates, Vox Populi 
only inquired about the support for Sarney and Orestes Quercia, 
leaving Roberto Requiao aside. Requiao received the least 
support in a poll about PMDB pre-presidential candidates only. 
When Quercia is included in the list of candidates, he occupies 
the fourth place with 5 percent of the votes, Lula receives 35 
percent of the votes, Fernando Henrique Cardoso 16 percent, and 
former Governor Leonel Brizola 9 percent. 
  With the votes that were given to Sarney, the number of 
votes 
given to Lula decreased by five points, those given to Cardoso 
by one point, and those to Brizola by two points. Progressive 
Renewal Party candidate Espiridiao Amin and Liberal Party 
candidate Flavio Rocha remained stable in their positions with 3 
percent and 1 percent, respectively. 
  Brizola was chosen by 20 percent of those interviewed as the 
worst candidate on the list. The next worst candidate is Lula, 
who is rejected by 13 percent of the people. He is followed by 
Quercia (8 percent), and Sarney (7 percent). Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso is rejected by just 4 percent of those interviewed. 
  In three different projections about the second round -- 
with 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Quercia, and Sarney as his rivals -- 
the Workers Party candidate, Lula, wins. His tightest victory 
is over Sarney: 40 percent to 32 percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero by reporter </F>
Celia Chaim; date and place not given] 
  [Text] [Chaim] With the implementation of a new currency, 
will Brazilians finally have a functional economy? 
  [Ricupero] I am very optimistic about what will happen in 
the 
short-term because all steps to make stability a reality have 
been taken. We have ensured the fiscal reform through the 
Social Emergency Fund. There is pressure and there are 
difficulties but I believe we will achieve a good operational 
result in the budget. We have the largest reserves in our 
history and they are enough to cover our imports for 12 months. 
We have reached agreement about our debt and reopened the doors 
to the international market. We are even preparing a Treasury 
certificate. I have appointed a working team to define the 
details of this certificate. Through it, we will be able to 
attract resources at lower interest rates in the domestic 
market. We have also had unprecedented crops: 75 million 
tonnes. Following the 1992 recession, the economy has grown 4.5 
percent during the last 15 months. International conditions are 
improving. There is a large group of favorable indicators that 
convinces us that when the real is implemented, the inflation 
rate will drop in a swift and accentuated manner. 
  [Chaim] How will this happen? 
  [Ricupero] The inflation rate will drop for several reasons. 
Particularly because the de-indexation of the economy will be 
very advanced. We believe the inflation rate will begin to drop 
in an accentuated manner after the second month. 
  [Chaim] Will it be possible to maintain the inflation rate 
at 
very low levels for a long time? 
  [Ricupero] Until the end of this year, I am sure it will. My 
main concern is about the medium- and long-term. The government 
has never hidden that the consolidation of the economic 
adjustment will demand structural reforms that will require 
modifying the Constitution. This is why I made such a big 
effort to see the constitutional reform continue -- not to 
benefit from it. Even if the constitutional reform had been 
very well advanced, its effects would only begin to be felt in 
the medium-term. My effort sought to make things easier for my 
successor. 
  [Chaim] How will you convince Autolatina [car-manufacturing 
company] workers, and all other workers, that despite the 
increase in prices, salaries need not be readjusted? 
  [Ricupero] As I have frequently said, it is an illusion to 
think that salary hikes obtained through strikes will solve that 
problem. These excessive increases -- as much as 19 percent -- 
currently being granted worry me. The worker rejoices, the 
inflation rate is pushed up, and shortly after that the salary 
increase is consumed. What you achieve with your left hand, the 
right hand -- inflation -- destroys. People must realize that 
the only salvation is stability, which is the pre-condition for 
growth because economic growth depends on investment. With 
inflation like ours, there is no investment. In 1992, our 
investment rate dropped to 14.5 percent of the GDP, while in the 
1970's it stood at 25 percent, like that of the Asian Tigers. 
  [Chaim] You have just eight more months in the government. 
Do you have time to do something more concrete in such a short 
period of time? 
  [Ricupero] I believe there is time enough to reestablish a 
very high-level of stability in the economy. 
  [Chaim] How? 
  [Ricupero] We will adopt rules for the new currency that 
will 
create confidence about issuance control. We will also adopt 
rules to link the real to international reserves. At the same 
time, I will not limit my horizon strictly to the implementation 
of the stabilization plan, which is my main task: I will act in 
two areas that need defined policies; first I will define an 
industrial policy that can be competitive abroad. I plan to do 
that together with the Science and Technology Ministry and the 
Industry and Commerce Ministry. Our commercial opening lacks 
one detail: an industrial and competitive policy. At the same 
time, I want to enter the job policy area, although this area is 
not the responsibility of my ministry only. The best way to 
solve social problems is first, to put an end to inflation and 
second, to create jobs. I believe a lot can be done in eight 
months regarding policy definition... 
  [Chaim] What is the job-generating policy that you intend 
to implement? 
  [Ricupero] The main subject in all economies is the job 
issue. The problem has not been solved either by market or by 
socialist economies, which alleged attained full employment but 
based on a surplus -- a company that needed 100 employees has 
300. I think Brazil -- beside supporting the many different 
small and middle-size enterprises, and gradually reducing taxes 
-- must face a very serious problem which is the very high cost 
of generating job openings, the so-called social cost. We, in 
Brazil, with our poor economy, have higher social costs than 
Denmark. What is worse, our social services are very bad. For 
every dollar a Brazilian businessman pays in salaries, he pays 
81 cents for social benefits. We must thus convince the left and 
the labor unions that this situation cannot improve the workers' 
wellbeing. The path to the wellbeing of workers is via a 
productive sector that generates abundant, well paid, and good 
quality jobs. That is how the social matter must be solved. 
  [Chaim] But there are powerful sectors that benefit a lot 
from inflation and which are against stability... 
  [Ricupero] There are sectors that coexist and even prosper 
under an economy like ours. We must create the conditions to 
end this situation. Brazil must attain a stability like in 
Europe, where it is a vindication of the people. I feel there 
is hope for such a thing here. During the Cruzado Plan, with 
all its mistakes, there was great pride in being Brazilians, the 
people felt they had a strong currency. There is no reason why 
this should not happen again. That is why I asked the president 
to announce the new currency. The currency is a symbol of 
sovereignty. 
  [Chaim] What is the acceptable inflationary expectation for 
the real? 
  [Ricupero] I cannot give you a figure. It is difficult to 
calculate, mainly because Brazilian indexes measure past 
inflation. It is very complicated to explain that the first 
indexes of the real will measure inflation from the former 
month. That is why I cannot answer. But inflation will be very 
low after the second month. 
  [Chaim] How will you prevent businessmen from excessively 
readjusting their prices? 
  [Ricupero] By negotiating, by using the law we have, and by 
increasing competitiveness. 
  [Chaim] But this formula has not worked very well. 
  [Ricupero] It is my responsibility to administrate the 
economic plan. I believe the plan belongs to everyone. I do 
not see any contradiction between the interests of a candidate 
and the plan's consistency. Anyone who wishes to become 
president will find an economy on the way to stabilization. 
Even Lula said that. It is obvious. It is better to be 
Rodrigues Alves [Brazilian president from 1902 to 1906] than to 
be Campos Sales [Brazilian president from 1898 to 1902]. Campos 
Sales left Catete Palace [then Government House in Rio de 
Janeiro] booed by the public until he boarded the train for Sao 
Paulo. Rodrigues Alves was popular because he inherited a 
streamlined economy and he was able to do many things. Which do 
the candidates prefer?

  [Excerpt] Brasilia -- President Itamar Franco on 28 April 
signed a new version of the provisional measure that creates the 
Real Value Unit [URV] and the real. He introduced it with two 
modifications that had been negotiated with Congress: First, 
the guarantee of covering, beginning 1 July, any possible loss 
in purchasing power of salaries converted into URV's. This will 
be done if there is really any loss compared to the previous 
salary policy. Second, to ensure that the rules for issuance of 
the real comply with all legal demands and that the real will be 
implemented through a presidential decree. Provisional Measure 
No. 482, which was published in the official gazette today, does 
not establish a date for the new currency's implementation. 
Congress will have one month to vote on this provisional measure. 
  Although the economic team defended the idea of reissuing 
Provisional Measure No. 457 without modifying it, the opinion of 
the government's political area prevailed. In the afternoon of 
28 April, Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis Carvalho 
stated: "Everyone believed the original text should be 
preserved." He pointed out, however, that it was up to Finance 
Minister Rubens Ricupero and the president of the Republic to 
make the final decision on the issue. Ricupero's chief of staff, 
Sergio Amaral, said the finance minister offered President 
Itamar Franco the two alternatives. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Nelson de Oliveira] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Central Bank [BC] President Pedro Malan 
confirmed on 28 April that Brazil spent nearly $2.4 billion in 
the purchase of securities given as collateral for the debt 
rescheduling agreement with foreign private banks on 15 April. 
Malan explained that U.S. Treasury bills were purchased as 
collateral for Brazil's external debt principal. The average 
unit price of the T-bills that will mature in 2021 and 2022 was 
$0.153 per dollar. The real cost of the transaction was not 
disclosed. 
  Malan explained to the Senate Economic Affairs Committee 
that 
the securities were bought on the international secondary market 
after the U.S. Treasury's refusal to put out a special issue for 
Brazil as long as the country did not sign at least a short-term 
agreement with the IMF. As the purchase of such a volume of 
securities could have prompted much speculation and caused 
Brazil great losses, the BC bought them little by little in 
deals that were arranged with the utmost secrecy between 
December 1993 and March 1994. 
  The purchases were made from top-notch institutions that 
usually operate with Brazil. It is not known how many banks -- 
Brazil does not operate with brokers -- participated in these 
transactions. 
  Malan guaranteed that Brazil was not burdened with the 
payment of surcharges and commissions. The profit obtained by 
the sellers was based only on the difference between the 
purchase and selling price of the T-bills. Besides the $2.4 
billion as collateral for the principal, Brazil had to disburse 
$373 million as collateral for interest. This latter amount was 
invested in bonds placed on the market that will yield 
semi-annual interest. 
  The BC president told senators that Brazil will institute a 
more efficient management of its foreign exchange reserves. Now 
that an agreement with creditor banks has been reached, the 
country will not only be able to place reserves at higher 
interest rates, but also may repurchase and resell the T-bills 
that were issued on 15 April based on market quotations. 
  With the exception of Senator Eduardo Suplicy (PT-SP) 
[Workers Party-Sao Paulo], the committee members at the hearing 
were satisfied with the agreement's terms.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Deborah Berlinck in Geneva] </F>
  [Text] Brazilian Ambassador Luiz Felipe Lampreia was 
yesterday elected chairman of a group of countries that will 
propose a number of recommendations on trade and environmental 
issues to the future World Trade Organization (WTO). These 
issues could generate a great many controversies for the future 
organization, as several countries -- Brazil included -- are 
afraid that some countries, like the United States, could use 
environmental protection to erect new protectionist barriers. 
  The WTO, which will start functioning in January 1995, will 
regulate all of the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round 
of the GATT talks and approved this month in Marrakech, thus 
putting an end to the most ambitious global GATT negotiations to 
liberalize world trade in history. The mission of the group, 
led by Brazil, is to pave the way for the WTO to reach an 
agreement to reconcile the requirements contained in the many 
environmental protection treaties, including those approved in 
the Rio-92 Conference, with trade regulations. 
  This will not be an easy task. American environmentalists, 
for instance, do not want the issue discussed at the WTO, 
claiming that trade interests will prevail and that 
environmental standards will suffer. It is the pressure of 
these environmentalists that is forcing shrimp catchers in the 
Brazilian northeastern region to install a new device in their 
fishing nets to avoid the risk of killing turtles while catching 
shrimp. A U.S. law protecting turtles enables the U.S. 
Government today to ban imports of Brazilian shrimp. 
  In 1991, the United States banned imports of Mexican tuna 
fish over the use of inappropriate nets that were risking the 
lives of dolphins. The case was taken to GATT, but Mexico 
itself withdrew the case later when it was trying to join NAFTA.

  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- Brazil has increased the 
scheduled activities of the MCEB [All-Brazilian Space Mission]. 
A third data monitoring satellite (SCD-3), which is not 
included in the original schedule, will be placed in orbit in 
the first half of 1996. This satellite will test the first 
national voice-operated command systems [primeiros sistemas 
nacionais de comando por voz], which will be created for the 
group of satellites on low-altitude equatorial orbits -- the 
ECO-8 -- which the Brazilian Space Agency considers a priority. 
In addition to giving continuity to the process of 
environmental data collecting work that began with SCD-1, the 
new satellite will fulfill agreements with Latin American and 
African countries. 
  The Brazilian space program was scheduled to operate with 
two 
data monitoring satellites (SCD-1 and SCD-2), two remote 
sensoring satellites (SSR-1 and SSR-2), and the Satellite Launch 
Vehicle (VLS). The SCD-1, which was placed in orbit in February 
1992, is operating beyond its planned useful life, while its 
successor is being tested at Inpe (National Institute of Space 
Research). The SCD-2 should start operating in 1995. The SSR 
series is behind schedule. The SCD-3 will compensate for this 
delay and feed the environmental data network until the launch 
of the first satellite in the program of cooperation with China 
(CBERS) [China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite]. 
  Inpe Director General Marcio Nogueira Barbosa has said that 
this year he will receive an additional $3 million budget 
allocation for immediate construction of the SCD-3. "The Space 
Agency is obtaining the funds," he said. The technicians at the 
scientific center are replanning the other satellites to match 
the expansion of the MECB. 
  The satellite will test the voice communication center that 
will operate in the ECO-8. The estimated cost of the new 
satellite is $14 million. Brazilian Space Agency President Luiz 
Gilvan Meira has said that this will adjust the deadlines for 
current Brazilian scientific needs.

  [Text] In a controversial operation, which is suspicious in 
some experts' opinion, Brazil is participating in the explosive 
international atomic market. On 20 April, ISTOE learned about a 
deal (renting yellow cake [two preceding words in English] and 
enriched uranium to the U.S. enterprise Nuexco) that left the 
Brazilian strategic reserves at zero. Some suspect that Brazil 
may be indirectly feeding an Iraqi or Iranian atomic bomb. 
Others warn about the risk Brazil is running of being the victim 
of a "nuclear swindle [calote nuclear]." Brazilian Nuclear 
Industries (INB) President Roberto Franca celebrated the 
transaction as the first step toward the financial independence 
of the state-owned uranium-producing company: "I made an open 
commercial transaction through bidding." For $1.7 million, the 
INB rented out the fuel for periods ranging from six to 18 
months. The fuel will begin being returned in August. Nuexco 
sent the Brazilian fuel to Canada. Professor Bernardino Ponte, 
who was an International Atomic Energy Agency surveyor for 12 
years, found the news strange. He said: "Canada does not use 
uranium oxide produced by Brazil, which has a low 
concentration." To those who want to solve the mystery, 
professor Ponte suggests they read the book YELLOW CAKE [two 
preceding words in English] by journalist Alexandre Baumgarten, 
who was murdered in 1982. In the book, the journalist discusses 
the trafficking in Brazilian uranium to be used in the 
production of atomic bombs in Iraq, Iran, and India. Strategic 
Affairs Secretary Admiral Mario Flores told ISTOE on 22 April: 
"I do not believe Canada would accept playing this sort of 
role. Canada is one of the most active controllers of the use of 
nuclear energy." Adm. Flores was asked about the issue before 
the business was closed. The INB president confirmed: "I 
believe the material was really transferred to Canada because 
part of the fuel that was stored in Brazil was shipped to 
Canada." According to Franca, what Nuexco did with the fuel is 
not Brazil's problem. Corvette Captain Sergio Porto da Luz, 
adviser to the Chamber of Deputies National Defense Committee, 
doubts the negotiation's strategic virtues. The problem is that 
the 200 metric tons that must be returned in August are crucial 
for the production of pills to recharge Angra-1. This operation 
is expected to take place in the beginning of 1995. "The U.S. 
company may not have fuel available at the established moment 
and decided to pay us for it in cash," Porto da Luz fears. 
Franca answers: "Nuexco has given us all guarantees, 
particularly because it has its own mines." The funds from the 
transaction have been used to reactivate the Pocos de Caldas 
mine. By July, the pills stock will have been reduced to 80 
metric tons, which is less than half the pills necessary to 
recharge Angra-1.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Sixto Duran-Ballen; place and date not </F>
given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow citizens: Tonight, it is my pleasure to 
announce that after a complex negotiating process, my government 
has reached an agreement with international commercial banks 
that will finally allow us to restructure the Ecuadoran foreign 
debt. The national government, faithful to its historic duty of 
transforming the country and with a firm determination to 
seriously manage state problems, could not allow Ecuador, 
because of its status as a repeatedly delinquent debtor, to 
become unworthy of international trust and to face serious 
difficulties in its relations with friendly countries and 
international financial organizations. 
  Fellow citizens, in the current issue of a very prestigious 
publication, Ecuador topped the list of countries in 
international arrears for the longest time. If one considers 
the periods during which Ecuador has not kept its international 
commitments, as it has been doing for the last (?seven) years, 
you can see that the country has been in arrears for 112 of its 
164 years of republican life. 
  What has all of the above cost us? It has given us a country 
with enormous problems attracting foreign investment, creating 
sources of employment and production, obtaining technology to 
progress and vigorously incorporate ourselves into a world that 
is increasingly more competitive and demanding; a country with 
serious problems obtaining credits; a country that must resort 
to costly loans because of the high-risk status that a country 
in arrears represents; a country without the capability to 
generate the necessary domestic and foreign capital to promote 
great projects for its development; and a country that has seen 
a substantial reduction in opportunities for the progress and 
well-being that we all desire. 
  Ecuador could not continue like that. If we needed to 
promote foreign investment, if we wanted to obtain new 
technologies, if we wanted to create new job sources, and if we 
aspired to enter the international capital market as a basic 
condition for developing our potential, we had to reach an 
agreement with our private international creditors. That is why 
I instructed the economic front to undertake the negotiations 
and to obtain an advantageous agreement with our creditors that 
would not commit more resources than those the country was 
prepared to make available for that purpose. As every action of 
my administration, I ordered a restructuring of the foreign debt 
with private creditors under the most advisable terms for the 
country, making sure that the agreement would not place 
financial pressure on future governments. Our proposals were 
accepted, allowing me to announce today that Ecuador has reached 
an advantageous agreement with its private creditors. 
  We have agreed on terms and discounts better than those 
generally obtained by Latin American countries that have reached 
agreements of this type. We have obtained clearly favorable 
conditions, even though Ecuador had a long record of 
noncompliance and one of the highest rates of overdue interests 
payment on its obligations. We have restructured the capital 
debt for 30 years with a 45-percent discount. We have 
refinanced accrued interest for 20 years with a very good 
interest rate and a 10-year grace period. With this agreement, 
we have ensured that the country will not be pressured in the 
future regarding its ability to make payments. 
  Fellow citizens, I make this announcement with great 
satisfaction because it marks a decisive step toward our 
permanent objective of resolving the greatest national problems. 
The decision I have adopted is a clear demonstration that I am 
running a serious and responsible government that works for the 
future and does not act for momentary political [word 
indistinct]. 
  Fellow citizens, we have resolved a problem that affected 
everyone, absolutely everyone, because it prevented real social 
and economic development despite our great potential. 
  This evening, upon giving you this important news, I 
reiterate that I will continue working for the country's welfare 
and to give you definitive solutions to national problems, 
solutions that have been irresponsibly deferred. I insist that 
I work to build a better Ecuador for future generations. This 
is a commitment I have to you, Ecuadoran people. Thank you very 
much.

  [Text] Quito, 2 May (EFE) -- The Ecuadoran opposition 
increased its majority in Congress and dealt a strong blow to 
the conservative government, which only obtained seven of 65 
seats in the legislative elections held on 1 May, according to 
an unofficial vote count of 89.5 percent of the votes revealed 
today. 
  The populist right-wing Social Christian Party (PSC), 
received the most votes, 19 percent, and won 22 seats, according 
to figures provided by the local media (the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal will only give final results by the end of the month). 
  Second place went to the populist Ecuadoran Roldosist Party 
(PRE), which won 10 seats. Third place went to the Maoist 
Democratic People's Movement (MPD). The social democrat 
Democratic Left Party (ID) won six seats and the Christian 
democrat Popular Democracy Party (DP) won five. 
  President Sixto Duran-Ballen's Republican Unity Party (PUR) 
only obtained two seats, and Vice President Alberto Dahik's 
Conservative Party (PCE) obtained five. According to the Quito 
newspaper EL COMERCIO, there was a high percentage of nullified 
votes (18 percent).

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Arnaldo Gonzalez -- live] </F>
  [Text] Thank you very much. We are again reporting from the 
entry to Puente Remanso where we are watching the famous Cacavel 
and Urutu tanks as they arrive on their way to Asuncion. There 
are approximately 20 tanks with turrets and other armored 
vehicles. The units are coming from Cavalry Regiment No. 2 of 
Cerrito. 
  We are counting the vehicles. They are two, four, six, 
eight, 
10. There are approximately 20 tanks and vehicles manned by 
soldiers in a state of readiness. Perhaps our cameraman Quinonez 
could show the soldiers. [video focuses on passing vehicles] 
Vehicles continue to come from Cerrito. We will go after them in 
order to find out where they are heading. 
  It is important to note that we have been told that more 
tanks are coming from this area. This is the first place from 
where tanks are being sent. Another group of military vehicles 
has gathered at the bridge's head and now are heading for 
Asuncion. We believe they are heading for the Campo Grande 
Cavalry unit. We will see what they will do. 
  [Studio announcer] It still remains to be seen whether this 
is part of normal maneuvers or a special mobilization. This 
morning, Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia said the Armed 
Forces are ready to intervene in the ongoing national strike, if 
requested. No official information has been released yet on this 
tank movement. [The same television station reports at 1455 GMT 
that the tanks and military vehicles have entered the RC-4 
Cavalry Regiment headquarters in Loma Pyta, about 10 kms from 
Asuncion.]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Armed Forces Information </F>
Directorate Colonel Carlos Medina Monjagata by RPC anchorman 
Christian Nielsen -- live] 
  [Text] [Nielsen] At this point, we can supply our viewers 
official information about this morning's deployment of armored 
vehicles from Cerrito to the 4th Cavalry Regiment base. We have 
Colonel Carlos Medina Monjagata from the Armed Forces 
Information Directorate on the phone. Good morning, colonel. 
  [Medina] Good morning, Mr. Nielsen and the same to your kind 
viewers. Mr. Nielsen, first, I would like to thank you for this 
chance you have given us to keep the people informed about the 
deployment of armored vehicles from the 2d Cavalry Regiment 
headquartered in Cerrito. 
  The deployment's purpose is to bring our material closer to 
the capital city so as to be able to comply with any order to 
help out the National Police if they are overwhelmed by violent 
actions related to ongoing events. The purpose of this 
information is to assure the citizenry that the Armed Forces 
will leave its barracks only if ordered to do so and only if it 
becomes absolutely necessary. 
  [Nielsen] Was this deployment part of the plans drawn up in 
advance to deal with today's situation? 
  [Medina] That is correct; the Armed Forces are always ready 
and prompt to help re-establish public order -- provided, I 
repeat, they are ordered to do so -- and help out the National 
Police if they are unable to carry out their mission because 
they are overwhelmed. 
  [Nielsen] For the time being, you are not contemplating 
having to deal with disturbances bigger than those that have 
been taking place so far? 
  [Medina] From what we could see and hear through the news 
media, no serious disturbances are taking place. For the most 
part, they seem to be rather unimportant. Thus, we believe that 
everything that is taking place is in keeping with the law, but 
this does not mean that we should not be ready and prepared to 
help -- if ordered to do so -- the National Police. 
  [Nielsen] Thank you very much, colonel, for this official 
information, the first we have had since the deployment of 
armored vehicles was first spotted this morning. Thank you for 
your kindness. 
  [Medina] Thank you, Mr. Christian Nielsen.

<F P=106> [Report from the Justice and Labor Ministry by Anibal Gomez </F>
-- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Gomez] Yes, Mr. Nielsen, a meeting between 
Interior Minister Carlos Podesta and the justice and labor 
minister has just ended. Mr. Interior Minister, what can you 
tell us; is there something new? 
  [Podesta] We have been looking at the information the 
justice 
and labor minister has received on all the firms and companies 
throughout the country and we have seen that more than 75 
percent of all companies throughout the country are working 
normally. This is very positive because it means that most 
companies have respected the rights of both those who wanted to 
strike and those who did not. 
  [Gomez] Is this information objective, Mr. Minister? 
  [Podesta] Let us not waste any time. 
  [Gomez] I am asking you this question because the union 
leaders are saying something else... 
  [Podesta, interrupting] That is all right, but your question 
is...[pauses] You have my report and I will not start casting 
doubts on my own report. 
  [Gomez] What is your objective, Mr. Minister? Are you trying 
to say the strike was not successful? 
  [Podesta] That is really irrelevant. The objective is to 
take advantage of the news media's goodwill and work to keep the 
people informed. 
  [Gomez] What will be the result of all this, and what will 
be 
the government's reaction to this? 
  [Podesta] Nothing will come out of this, and the strike is a 
very important event. The union leaders and the people who have 
supported the strike have had the opportunity to exercise their 
right to demonstrate and those who do not agree with them are 
working normally. 
  [Gomez] Mr. Minister, although we already have official 
information on this, it is somewhat frightening to know that 
these tanks are ready to move in if the National Police were to 
ask... 
  [Podesta, interrupting] I cannot believe that you can be so 
biased, even though your medium is on the side of the strikers 
and I have noticed that you journalists are wearing T-shirts 
supporting the strike. Even so, I do not believe you can be so 
biased not to realize that union leaders and strikers have been 
aggressively trying to hamper transportation, to prevent 
downtown stores from opening, to close streets. Well, if one 
looks for something one is bound to find it. The state will not 
give up its right nor will it fail to do its duty to preserve 
public order. That is all there is to it. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Manny Cuenca from Silvio Petirossi </F>
International Airport -- live] 
  [Text] Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy has arrived 
at the international airport's military base and soon will board 
the plane that will take him to Brazil. He is traveling with 
his wife and some of his ministers. Wasmosy will fly to 
Uberaba, Brazil, where he will be decorated for his work with 
the International Federation of Zebu Cattle Breeders. He will 
also meet Brazilian President Itamar Franco on 3 May, although 
there was initially some doubt about this meeting given the 
official mourning declared in Brazil over the death of car 
racing champion Ayrton Senna. Sources close to the president 
have confirmed that the meeting will take place. 
  The president was actually supposed to leave for Brazil on 1 
May but he is leaving today. The plane is ready and the 
president is saying goodbye to ministers, high-ranking military 
officers, and Colorado Party leaders. 
  [Begin Wasmosy recording] Messrs. journalists, as I have 
told 
you before, we are respecting and will continue to respect the 
rights of the strikers and will protect them, but they do not 
have the right to close streets, highways, set tires on fire, 
and other things. We will not allow this because both strikers 
and those who do not want to participate in the strike have the 
same rights. It is the government's duty to keep streets and 
highways open to traffic. This is our duty and we will do it. 
Thank you. [end recording] 
  This was President Wasmosy on his way to the plane, 
reiterating the position that several ministers stated a few 
minutes ago at Government House. The president now is boarding 
the plane with his wife, Teresa Carrasco, and the agriculture 
and livestock minister. As you have seen on the screen, 
President Wasmosy's plane has started rolling and this is the 
end of our report.

  [Text] Although it was not on the agenda, the congressional 
Constitution Committee yesterday approved a draft bill 
regulating the use of, and procedures for filing, habeas data 
petitions in court. If Congress approves the draft bill, habeas 
data cases will be heard only by civil courts and not by 
criminal courts. 
  The draft law was submitted by Carlos Torres y Torres Lara, 
chairman of the Constitution Committee, who announced that the 
bill will be debated by the Congress plenum today. 
  Although government and opposition blocs in Congress agree 
on 
the need to define this subject as soon as possible to eliminate 
any possible threat to the freedom of press in Peru, the diverse 
positions on the subject prompted a heated debate. 
  In the end the majority approved the proposal to regulate 
the 
habeas data right through a specific law, while the minority 
demanded that the habeas data be eliminated from the text of the 
Constitution. 
  The proposal to regulate habeas data was finally approved by 
a 7-6 vote. 
  The draft bill is divided into seven articles and one 
transitory measure. 
  The first article states that, until a specific law is 
approved, habeas data cases will be heard by a civil court near 
where the alleged offense took place. 
  The second article states that media organizations are 
required to correct earlier reports without delay -- within 
three days -- and proportionally to the original report. In 
case of disagreement, a judge will decide when the correction 
must be published. 
  Procedures set forth for the constitutional right of Amparo 
(with the exception of the provisions of Article 11 of Law 
No.23506, as outlined in Article 3 of the bill) will be 
applicable to habeas data petitions in case of procedural 
loopholes. 
  The only transitory article of the bill states that if a 
habeas data petition is filed before a criminal court, it should 
be turned over to a civil court. 
  The great majority approved the draft bill which Torres y 
Torres initially submitted to Congress in October, but which he 
submitted again yesterday after revising it and updating it. 
  Torres y Torres feels that because this tool is new to 
Peruvian law, it should be regulated by a transitory law to give 
the nation time to gain experience before drafting a specific 
law. 
  Torres y Torres asserted that the Constitution states that 
habeas data cases must be heard by civil courts in accordance 
with the procedures set forth in a writ of amparo and this is 
why criminal courts have turned down every habeas data petition 
filed before them. 
  Torres y Torres voiced confidence that this bill will dispel 
every doubt about procedural matters concerning habeas data 
petitions. 
  He said he believes the subject has been misinterpreted by 
some citizens and used for political purposes by the opposition. 
  The opposition believes a law of implementation alone will 
not suffice. Roger Caceres (Frenatraca) [National Front of 
Workers and Peasants] and Lourdes Flores Nano (PPC) [Popular 
Christian Party] argued the need to eliminate the habeas data 
right. 
  The PPC legislators say it is unnecessary because the writ 
of 
amparo guarantees the right of rectification. 
  Henry Pease (MDI) [Democratic Left Movement], however, is 
not 
so radical. He proposes derogating just Paragraph 7 of the 
constitutional article on habeas data which refers to the media 
organizations. 
  Torres y Torres Lara conveyed his satisfaction over the 
outcome of the committee hearing.

  [Text] Lima, 2 May (EFE) -- LA REPUBLICA reported today 
that several Peruvian Army members cut the throats of five 
people, one of them a 13-year-old girl, in the northern jungle 
region, according to an accusation made by the wife of one of 
the victims, who witnessed the murder. 
  According to the witness, Amalia Tolentino, whose 
whereabouts 
are being kept secret, the bodies of five people found near 
Moyuna are peasants whose throats had been cut by Army soldiers 
who arrested them on 8 April. 
  One of the dead is Jesus Vera Virgilio, Tolentino's husband, 
who was murdered despite having identified himself as an Army 
informer. 
  Tolentino said that an Army patrol commanded by a captain 
murdered the five people after accusing them of being 
terrorists. She said she was pardoned because she was carrying a 
baby girl. 
  The daily reported that she found her husband's body with a 
slit throat. 
  This case was reported by Tolentino to the special 
prosecutor 
for human rights in Huanuco, capital of Huanuco Department in 
the northern jungle region, where since 5 April a military 
antiterrorist operation has been under way in Leoncio Prado 
Province. 
  A prosecutor and several doctors examined on 29 April the 
remains of the five people, of whom only the bones were left. 
  According to the doctors, the skulls and long bones showed 
no 
signs of gunshot wounds, and therefore the cause of death was 
not established. They added, however, that they were probably 
killed before 5 April, when the military operations began. 
  The bodies were buried at the same site, and no autopsy was 
carried out. 
  Francisco Diez Canseco, president of the National Peace 
Council, said that "it is obvious" that "isolated cases" of 
human right violations were made during the military operation. 
  Despite this, Diez Canseco believes that accusations by the 
Human Rights National Coordinating Board of the bombing of 
civilians and the deaths of dozens of people are exaggerated. 
  Diez Canseco admitted, however, the case involving two women 
who said they were raped by soldiers. He said: "The women said 
they were able to escape, but others were not so lucky and were 
murdered." 
  He admitted: "It is a fact that abuses were committed." 
  The U.S. State Department demanded of the Peruvian 
Government 
an investigation into the charges, and the Peruvian Foreign 
Ministry answered with a harsh communique claiming an 
"unfriendly" U.S. attitude. 
  Carlos Blanco, president of the Human Rights Committee in 
Congress, said he will visit the U.S. Embassy in Lima today to 
protest the "interference in the country's internal affairs."

  [Text] Lima, 1 May (EFE) -- The local news media today 
reported that security forces have liberated 1,135 Peruvian 
Ashaninka people who were being held by the Shining Path [SL] 
terrorist gang. 
  The Ashaninkas were freed from several villages on the banks 
of the Ene River, in Satipo Province, Junin Department, a jungle 
area in the Peruvian central mountain region. 
  Journalists state that the captives had been literally 
enslaved by the maoist gang. They are suffering from 
malnutrition and many appear to have tuberculosis. 
  The Ashaninkas were freed by the Army units in the course of 
recent operations. They together with some who managed to flee 
from the terrorists are currently receiving medical care and 
food at regional counter-subversive bases. 
  The SL has been operating in the jungle area of Junin 
Department since 1984.

  [Excerpt] Lima, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Evangelical pastor Juan 
Mallea has been released after spending nine months in prison 
and after it was demonstrated that he is innocent of terrorist 
charges. He reported today that he was tortured by Peruvian 
Counterterrorism police who wanted him to plead guilty. 
  Mallea announced that his attorney-at-law is studying the 
possibility of filing a claim for damages against the Peruvian 
police and state for moral and economic damage as a result of 
the charges that determined his confinement in the Canto Grande 
prison in Lima. 
  Mallea asked the government to publicly admit its mistake 
"because it is for men to admit their mistakes." 
  Mallea, who was detained on 10 July 1993, held a news 
conference. He recalled that on 21 July 1993 he was tortured by 
Counterterrorism Directorate (DINCOTE) agents. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Despite the progress made thus far this year 
compared to 1993, the amount of precursors confiscated during 
the first four months of 1994 accounts for only 3.5 percent of 
the total amount used by drug traffickers to process cocaine 
paste and cocaine. 
  Drug enforcement personnel have already confiscated 37,646 
kg 
of chemical precursors from several trafficking organizations in 
just four months this year. By contrast, Interior Ministry 
figures show that during 1993, only 74,200 kg of chemicals -- 
including sulphuric acid, acetone, hydrochloric acid, sodium 
carbonate, potassium permanganate, and ether -- were confiscated. 
  Drug analysts and DEA experts noted that 13 clandestine 
airfields have been destroyed in the Upper Huallaga region, as 
well as a 2,000-meter strip in Quempiri (near Satipo) and 
another near Tarapoto. 
  They have also destroyed 10 pits and 11 maceration labs that 
were equipped with microwave ovens and other sophisticated 
equipment. 
  Intelligence agents have concluded that the geographical 
location of the Apurimac-Ene basin is the reason why it has 
become in recent months the main route for chemicals for the 
Peruvian-Colombian mafia organization laboratories. 
  Drug enforcement forces have noted, however, that no major 
seizures have been made yet owing to the complicity of the local 
residents and coca growers, who in some cases have been forced 
by former Shining Path members -- who now work for the drug 
mafia -- to remain silent to protect the traffickers. 
  The analysts believe the traffickers have conscripted 
residents and peasants in the jungle of Satipo, Oxapampa, Ciudad 
Constitucion, Puerto Bermudez, Icozaxin, Huanta, La Mar, San 
Francisco, Palmapampa, Santa Rosa, La Convencion, and Palestina 
in the illegal drug trade. 
  A few weeks ago, police confiscated chemical supplies in the 
townships of San Pedro (Villa Rica-Oxapampa) and Palestina, 
where a CB-1420 aircraft crashed and its passengers managed to 
escape with the help of local residents. 
  The chemicals are also being transported in small boats 
along 
the Pichis, Palcazu, Ene, Perene, and Apurimac rivers. 
  The township of Palmapampa (La Mar-Ayacucho), which is on 
the 
Apurimac River, continues to be the transaction center for the 
"firms," which are guarded by mercenaries armed with modern 
weapons. 
  The commander of drug enforcement operations is reinforcing 
his personnel with specialized personnel in the region, where 
until recently there were just 12 policemen and a small Air 
Force base, which tried to detect the small planes used by 
traffickers. 
  Some of those "firms" have moved their operations toward the 
Tambopata basin where, protected by the intricate wilderness, 
they set up laboratories to produce the drugs that are sent to 
Brazil.

  [Text] Gonzalo Aguirre, leader of the Victory and Renewal 
Movement (MRV), has been elected a presidential candidate. The 
speech announcing his election was followed by shouts of "viva 
Gonzalo" and the singing of the "Three Trees" march. Aguirre 
spoke for almost an hour. He placed special emphasis in his 
Wilsonist roots [late Blanco Party leader Wilson Ferreira 
Aldunate], expressing support for a liberal economic policy and 
a future coalition government. 
  The ceremony to announce his candidacy was held on 16 April 
and attended by 4,000 people. There were flags, placards, and 
signs of the List 97.70 headed by former Deputy Carlos 
Rodriguez--the strongest candidate to be Aguirre's running 
mate--and List 4 headed by Senator Julio Grenno and his 
Canelones colleague Bari Gonzalez. 
  Several telegrams congratulating the candidate arrived 
during 
the ceremony. They were sent by Herreraist [Blanco Party 
faction] candidate Juan Andres Ramirez, Senator Walter Santoro, 
former Minister Alvaro Ramos, former Senator Enrique Veltran, 
Maldonado Mayor Domingo Burgueno, and former law school dean 
Adolfo Gelsi Bidart, among others. 
  Aguirre said Wilson Ferreira was "the most important 
national 
and National Party figure in the past decades." He cited 
Ferreira several times in his speech when mentioning 
"decentralization, the main problem the country has to solve." 
He recalled that "this was the last great job" undertaken by the 
late National Party leader. 
  Aguirre said his option is "not a third option or an 
intermediate one (...). It is not a third option because in 
electoral times citizens and their votes determine who is first. 
It is not an intermediate option because it is not located 
between other party forces. Our option is located in a space 
determined by our definitions and the personality of our 
candidates." 
  Aguirre said that during his campaign "they will not indulge 
in personal attacks" or the "systematic criticism of other 
parties' governments, at the national or departmental level." 
  He said: "No matter who wins, we will help the creation of a 
coalition government with all our strength. A true coalition 
supposes a political alliance to exercise government duties 
based on guidelines agreed upon by coalition members and not 
unilaterally imposed by the president of the Republic." 
  The elected candidate said his government will not be "a 
copy" of the present administration, although he will continue 
"its work" of "maintaining a healthy economy and fighting 
inflation and the fiscal deficit" in a "distinct way and with 
our own style and image," because "for us economic policy must 
not be dogmatic (...) or constitute an end in itself." 
  During the speech that was frequently interrupted by 
applause, Aguirre mentioned the topics that in his opinion will 
be the main campaign issues: decentralization, education reform, 
the state's role's definition, social security reform, an 
analysis of the tax system and its eventual reform, and the 
creation of new jobs. 
  Aguirre expressed support for a liberal economic policy. "We 
will support liberalism, but social liberalism (...) a policy 
where the state does not suffocate private initiative with 
regulations, its presence, and state monopolies. A policy where 
the state does not neglect the basic needs of the people or stop 
giving priority attention to education, housing, and health."

  [Text] Montevideo, 29 Apr (EFE) -- The Uruguayan Episcopal 
Conference today disseminated a document warning politicians of 
"dangerous divisions in leadership" and of the difficulties 
created in taking dynamism away from government work. 
  The bishops issued a document entitled "Values, Base of Our 
Development," asking candidates in the 29 November elections to 
issue "proposals and programs with clarity and sincerity." 
  According to the bishops, the "positive economic indicators" 
have not reached the country's poor. 
  The document was signed by all bishops. It was the result of 
a compromise between different Church groups in one of the most 
secular countries in Latin America. 
  The Church's political weight is quite small in Uruguay, a 
country with an entrenched liberal tradition. 
  This situation is made clear by the total lack of weight of 
a 
political party with Catholic traditions and the great number of 
agnostic and lay candidates. 
  The bishops' declaration does not side with any party or 
candidate, but warns that "the internal logic of Uruguayan 
electoral democracy carries an ethical commitment involving all 
participating groups and individuals to accept and help the 
candidate gaining the most votes, even after reasonable 
compromises and agreements are closed, to be able to implement 
the program chosen by the people." 
  The bishops pointed out that the electoral year "is an 
occasion to meditate together about our country and to put the 
election at the service of common good." 
  The document asks for "a review of the public education 
system, to guarantee respect for all family heads," insisting on 
the need for a pluralistic public school system, a school system 
that is secular for laymen, Catholic for Catholics, and Jewish 
for Jewish people. 
  The document concludes by reiterating "the decisive 
importance of human life's ethical and spiritual dimension, 
which is the solid foundation upon which all structures of 
coexistence are based: family as well as political, juridical, 
economic, social, labor, and cultural organizations, in all 
their manifestations."

<F P=106> [Speech by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban </F>
Workers Federation [CTC], at the opening of the morning session 
of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] in 
Havana on 1 May; monitored in progress -- recorded] 
  [Text] ...Furthermore, we have the immense satisfaction of 
having a representation of labor union leaders and friendly 
personalities who have come in large numbers to bring us their 
solidarity and encouragement on this 1 May. [applause] They 
symbolize all the workers and progressive forces that are 
mobilizing around the world to support our resistance, condemn 
the blockade, and defend their own hope in Cuba. Our most 
sincere thanks, esteemed brothers. 
  Before this session, Comrade Fidel showed us the path to 
walk. To his political view and his trust in the masses we owe 
the idea of the workers' parliaments, which were held with great 
success. In thousands of assemblies, workers expressed with 
profound feeling their appreciation to the commander in chief 
for giving them the opportunity to discuss the country's 
economic problems freely and openly. Thanks to that suggestion 
by Comrade Fidel in December, today we have a vast arsenal of 
ideas and proposals. We have discovered and put to work an 
important productive reserve; above all, we have reached a level 
of information and comprehension never before achieved on the 
nature of the problems we face, the conquests we should 
preserve, and which are our main alternatives to overcome the 
crisis. 
  The recent extended plenum of our National Committee of the 
CTC, during which we held an extensive exchange with the 
commander in chief on the results of the workers' parliaments, 
concluded that there is already a true national consensus upon 
which we can begin to build. For the Cuban labor movement, this 
process has also been an injection of energy and the discovery 
of methods that should serve to perfect our work further. We are 
sure that we now have the resources to reach the best conditions 
and to apply -- gradually and intelligently, but with 
determination and firmness -- the measures of restructuring and 
order that the people await: those that may emanate from this 
assembly and those that are already being carried out in tens of 
thousands of work centers with the understanding that only 
through more work and with an inevitable quota of sacrifice will 
we be able to overcome this exceptionally difficult situation. 
  The sacrifice is not what could intimidate us, because our 
people sacrifice themselves day after day. What can scare us is 
the possibility of losing our fatherland, which is finally free; 
the Revolution that brought work, justice, and dignity for all 
Cubans; and the socialism that transformed us into a people of 
comrades and brothers. For that reason, let us not vacillate in 
making the decisions that the country needs, in the certainty 
that no sacrifice will be too great if we preserve the historic 
conquests of the Revolution, and that nothing can break a people 
with no other vision than victory. 
  Viva International Workers Day! [crowd shouts: Viva!] Viva 
our glorious, invincible Revolution! [crowd shouts: Viva!] Viva 
Fidel! [crowd shouts: Viva!] Socialism or death, fatherland or 
death, we will win!

<F P=106> [Interview with Eduardo Martinez, president of the ANPP </F>
Economic Commission, by reporter Mariela Diaz, at the Convention 
Center in Havana on 2 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] The second day of the special session of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] focused on 
adopting policies to implement measures aimed at streamlining 
national finances. During the ANPP sessions, the address by 
Eduardo Martinez from the Economic Commission of the ANPP 
regarding a possible change in Cuban currency aroused intense 
debate. 
  [Begin recording] [Martinez] I believe that the change of 
currency is a valid measure that could effectively act upon the 
problems of the national financial imbalance. Therefore, it is 
one measure in the arsenal of possible measures. I believe it 
can be implemented at the opportune moment, although I believe 
there is another group of measures that can be adopted in a 
first instance without having recourse to the change of 
currency. In other words, I am not putting aside that 
possibility at all, for it is one of the possibilities the 
government should have at hand for implementation at the right 
moment. 
  [Diaz] The people are also highly concerned about the 
capacity, the purchasing power of the currency. Some people have 
asked us: After certain measures are taken, the dollars will 
have no value? Perhaps they are referring to an intermediate 
currency between our currency and hard currency. How would this 
function? 
  [Martinez] I believe it is still a little speculative to 
talk 
about this. The measures to control the hard currency 
circulation in Cuba ought to be adopted, but their exact shape 
must be adapted to the reality, and at the opportune moment. 
Therefore, to now try to define the exact shape seems to me a 
bit speculative. I believe the ANPP is highlighting the 
essential, the need to exert control over the circulation of 
hard currency in the country, which is already part of excess 
liquidity. 
  [Diaz] Can you tell if the prices in the dollar stores are 
going to increase or drop following this financial readjustment? 
  [Martinez] I can not predict that. 
  [Diaz] Thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] Havana, 2 May (DPA) -- The Cuban Government today 
received a green light from the National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP] to implement a drastic economic 
adjustment program that includes an increase in prices and 
tariffs on various products and services, the introduction of a 
graduated tax system, and an eventual exchange of currency. 
  The decision was made after two days of debates at the ANPP, 
which was convoked exclusively to analyze the fiscal deficit and 
the excess of money in circulation, problems which worsened 
dramatically after the collapse of Cuba's trade with its 
partners in the extinct socialist bloc. 
  Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and prices minister, announced 
that the measures will be gradually applied in no less than 180 
days. 
  The 600 parliamentary members unanimously approved the 
resolution in the presence of President Fidel Castro Ruz and 
also authorized an all-out struggle against black market 
speculators and hoarders, resorting to "exceptional measures" if 
necessary. 
  The resolution was drafted as an "agreement" that was read 
by 
ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon following a two-day debate during 
which the participants discussed recommendations from "workers" 
and from Minister Rodriguez. 
  First the ANPP asked the government to take the necessary 
measures to reduce subsidies that cover enterprises' losses and 
other budget expenditures, as well as to increase state revenues 
and "significantly" reduce the fiscal deficit, calculated to be 
4.8 billion pesos (equivalent to a dollar at the official 
exchange rate) last year. 
  The ANPP also authorized the government to seek the 
"stability" of funds deposited at the People's Savings Bank 
(BPA), calculated to be approximately 6 billion pesos, which 
represents 54 percent of the excess circulating money -- $11.636 
million. 
  The resolution stated that the measures adopted to 
eventually 
immobilize those funds must be "consistent with the decisions 
that will have repercussions on the amount of money in 
circulation" but "must also protect the integrity of the BPA and 
encourage savings." 
  It also authorized the government to adopt measures to 
establish "adequate controls" on speculation with foreign 
currency, which increased noticeably with the recent 
"legalization" of the dollar, to guarantee "fulfillment of the 
goals for which it was authorized and which correspond to the 
measures adopted to put internal finances on a sound basis." 
  Referring to prices and tariffs for products and services, 
the ANPP asked the government to "assess" an increase for 
"selected products and services," particularly those "not 
considered staples," including cigarettes and alcoholic 
beverages, and tariffs on certain services, such as restaurants, 
transportation, electricity, and water. 
  The resolution did not mention gasoline and lubricants, 
although it is assumed that their prices will be increased as 
suggested by Minister Rodriguez. 
  In another part of the agreement, the ANPP authorized the 
government to "gradually" implement a "new overall tax system," 
the enforcement of which takes into consideration "essential 
elements of social justice" to protect the sectors with the 
lowest income and to encourage work and production. 
  The document specifically suggested considering the 
"selective introduction" of an income tax, excluding salaries 
and real estate. 
  Although authorities said the measures will not affect the 
goals achieved in the education and health sector, the ANPP 
suggested the implementation of a "contribution" from the 
workers to finance social security. 
  Regarding an eventual exchange of currency, mentioned by 
Minister Rodriguez as a probable weapon in the "arsenal" of 
measures to counter the fiscal deficit and the excess of 
circulating money, the ANPP recommended "examining the 
advisability" of its implementation as "an element to complement 
other measures and to be enforced when the time is right." 
  The legislative branch virtually gave Fidel Castro's 
Government carte blanche by authorizing it to adopt other 
measures that, in its opinion, are considered "adequate and 
efficient" to put national finances on a sound basis. 
  When the announcement was made the legislators said the 
actions to be carried out by the government, and which Castro 
personally considered difficult "require the understanding and 
support of our people" to "progressively overcome the current 
circumstances."

  [Text] The approval of the accord on proposed measures and 
strategies to correct the national financial imbalance was the 
most important moment of this special session of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] held in the presence 
and with the active participation of Commander in Chief Fidel 
Castro. 
  The text of the document introduced by ANPP President 
Ricardo 
Alarcon de Quesada underscores the need to guarantee strict 
control of the implementation of the national budget at every 
level: 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] It asks the provincial and 
municipal assemblies to systematically audit the implementation 
of the budget in every region and promote the measures necessary 
to reduce expenses and increase revenues. 
  It charges the ANPP Standing Commission for Economic 
Affairs, 
in close cooperation with the Finance and Price Ministry, with 
directing the fulfillment of this task. 
  It highlights the importance of the accords adopted by the 
workers assemblies to promote economic efficiency and those 
accords that will be further developed through the assemblies, 
to be held from this date on, at work centers. 
  Likewise, it highlights the decisions approved by 
cooperative 
workers and those to be promoted by the Farmer's Honor and Pride 
assemblies, which are about to begin. 
  It determines that deputies, provincial and municipal 
delegates, and People's Councils are to be closely tied to these 
processes, and supports them in their contributution to the 
development of a powerful, effective, and systematic movement of 
the working masses in order to promote, from the base, 
collective initiatives to rationally use available resources, 
increase labor discipline and morale, adopt possible actions to 
increase efficiency, and audit compliance. 
  Our working people, who honorably confront the current 
adversities, have expressed their categorical rejection of the 
unscrupulous activities of those who have become wealthy, or 
intend to do so, at the expense of the sacrifice of the 
majority, and have demanded energetic action against those 
manifestations and their perpetrators. 
  As a result, the ANPP charges the Council of State and 
Government with adopting, as quickly as possible, every measure 
necessary, including those that might have an exceptional 
character, to eradicate those activities in the shortest 
possible period and exemplarily sanction the people involved. 
  The ANPP, likewise, charges the government with adopting 
decisions to systematically reduce the subsidies to cover losses 
of enterprises and other budgeted expenses, as well as 
increasing state budget revenues to significantly reduce the 
fiscal deficit. 
  To attain the stability of funds deposited in the People's 
Savings Bank [BPA] in correspondence with decisions affecting 
the volume of cash in circulation, while preserving the 
integrity of the BAP and savings incentives. 
  To establish measures promoting adequate control of the 
circulation of hard currency in the country, ensuring that the 
goals for which this circulation was authorized is fulfilled, 
and corresponding with measures adopted to streamline national 
finances. 
  To introduce essential production incentive mechanisms to 
promote an increase in the offer of products and services to the 
population at appropriate prices to stimulate the streamlining 
of national finances. 
  To study price and tariff increases on selected products and 
services taking, into account the feasibility of increasing 
prices on consumer items -- basically, nonessential products 
such as cigarettes and alcoholic beverages -- and tariffs in 
certain service categories such as public food services, 
transportation, and electricity, as well as charging for 
gratuities. 
  To gradually implement a new comprehensive tax system, 
taking 
into account indispensable elements of social justice to protect 
the lowest income sectors, stimulate work and production, and 
contribute to balancing national finances. 
  To study the selective introduction of a tax on personal 
income, excluding taxes on salary retributions, as well as 
increasing other taxes, rates, and contributions to state 
revenues. 
  To also study, in this regard, charging a tax for the use of 
aqueduct and water service, as well as having the workers 
contribute to the financing of social security. 
  To examine the feasibility of a change of currency to 
complement measures to be implemented at the opportune moment. 
Adopting other measures that, within these proposals, in the 
opinion of the government, are considered adequate and effective 
toward streamlining national finances. 
  The actions undertaken, and those to be taken in the future, 
require the understanding and support of our people. These will 
lead us to gradually overcome the current difficulties and will 
allow us to preserve the work created with everyone's effort, 
assuring for Cuba an even more just and noble future. 
  We call on everyone today to persevere in the heroic 
resistance, to redouble daily efforts, to continue demonstrating 
the undefeatable strength of our patriotic and revolutionary 
will, to continue fighting united to save our fatherland, 
Revolution, and socialism. 
  National Assembly of the People's Government, 2 May 1994. 
[end recording] 
  Commander in Chief Fidel Castro gave an address following 
the 
approval of the accord.

  [Excerpt] The National Assembly of the People's Government 
[ANPP] has approved the policies guiding the national financial 
reorganization. Commander in Chief Fidel Castro announced the 
upcoming promulgation of a decree law confiscating ill-gotten 
wealth resulting from profiteering. 
  [Begin Castro recording] Of course, the first one is going 
to 
come out, I believe, this very week. It is a Council of State 
decree law regarding the confiscation of ill-gotten wealth.

  [Text] Havana, 3 May (DPA) -- The Cuban peso's exchange 
rate with the dollar plummeted today in Havana's black market 
following official announcements of imminent economic adjustment 
measures and an all-out struggle against black market 
speculators. 
  The price of the U.S. currency, which was 100 pesos until 
this weekend, ranged between 300 and 500 pesos on the black 
market today, according to foreign tourists visiting Havana's 
downtown area and the old sector. The official exchange rate is 
one peso for one dollar. 
  A reliable anonymous source told DPA that "people today were 
frantically purchasing dollars in the streets of Havana." 
  Apparently speculation began after parliament, which met in 
a 
two-day special session, authorized a package of measures to 
reduce the fiscal deficit and the excess of circulating money. 
The package includes increases in prices and tariffs on various 
products and services, the implementation of a tax system, and a 
possible change in the type of Cuban currency. 
  This was compounded by the official announcement of an 
all-out struggle against black market hoarders and speculators, 
popularly known as "macetas." These "macetas" face confiscation 
of their assets if they cannot explain the source of their 
fortunes. 
  President Fidel Castro personally announced at the 
conclusion 
of today's parliamentary session the imminent approval, this 
week, of a decree-law on this issue.

<F P=106> [By Francisco Ramirez Cardenas] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 2 May (NOTIMEX) -- Thousands of Cubans today 
continued besieging the special stores that sell in dollars for 
fear of renewed price increases and the replacement of the U.S. 
currency by a local convertible peso. 
  [Words indistinct] National Assembly (Parliament), which is 
examining a harsh program of adjustments to reduce the budget 
deficit and the cash surplus. The budget deficit is currently 
4.2 billion pesos and the excess working capital totals 11.636 
billion, both equivalant to dollars at the official exchange 
rate. 
  For over a week, long lines of people have been gathering at 
the doors of the so-called diplomatic stores (diplotiendas) 
spurred by rumors to the effect that upon making purchases their 
dollars will be devaluated. This devaluation will become 
effective with the official issuance of new bills called 
certificates, which the people will exchange for devalued pesos 
at an as yet unspecified rate, according to diplomatic sources. 
  The purpose, according to the government media, is to 
exercise control over the growing dollarization of the island's 
economy. In August 1993 the government legalized the possession 
and use by citizens of freely convertible foreign currency. 
  Managers of stores such as the Caracol Chain, Panamericana, 
and Tecnitiendas over the weekend required the help of police to 
control cases of extreme tension among people in the lines. On 
San Rafael Street, an ancient commercial area where state-owned 
establishments' display cases are empty, the multitude 
overflowed the sidewalks and tangible tension at times posed a 
threat to the glass display cases. The manager of a Caracol 
store in the old Free Havana hotel issued instructions to have 
one of the lines moved back approximately 50 meters from the 
facility because "they hardly allowed room for the tourists," 
who are given priority. 
  At the supermarket located at the intersection of 5th and 
42d 
Streets in the once exclusive Miramar neighborhood, NOTIMEX saw 
a line of Cubans with bags stuffed with various items, including 
household appliances such as pots, television sets, and tape 
recorders. These purchases, which some diplomats attributed to 
panic, were confused with many people's purchases for "Mothers' 
Day," which is celebrated in Cuba on the second Sunday in May. 
  Finance and Price Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez yesterday 
defended the plan to collect a greater volume of dollars by 
selling products in those stores at higher prices and by taxing 
individuals whose salaries are paid in foreign currency. "The 
established policy is to collect the highest margins of profit 
through high prices, from foreign currency holders. These funds 
are then redistributed throughout the country for the people's 
benefit," according to Rodriguez. 
  At those stores, some of which bear the acronym TRD (foreign 
currency collection stores), prices are (?comparable) to those 
in the big cities of developed countries such as Tokyo, Paris, 
and New York. 
  Through the legalization of the dollar, the promotion of 
foreign investments, and tourism, the government is attempting 
to deal with the serious shortage of foreign currency resulting 
from the loss of its relations, preferential trade, and aid from 
the now defunct USSR. Since the legalization, the dollar has 
become the only currency with real purchasing power and for some 
the ownership of dollars has become a relief from the shortage 
of food, medicines, and other consumer goods. 
  According to Rodriguez, the taxation of income received in 
foreign currency would be applied to those people who receive 
payment in dollars and not to those who receive money from 
relatives abroad, such as exiles in the United States and other 
countries. 
  Having been authorized to undertake self-employment, 
producers who have no property and individuals who provide 
services are asking their clients for dollars, each of which go 
for 100 to 120 pesos on the flourishing black market. 
  Rodriguez also outlined to the legislators a package of 
monetary measures that include price and public service tariff 
increases, the implementation of taxes, the cessation of 
subsidies and heretofore free services, without dismissing the 
possibility of a change of national currency. 
  President Fidel Castro on Sunday told legislators that it is 
not only a matter of reorganizing the country's finances but of 
revaluating the money and salaries of state employees, 76 
percent of whom receive an average of 180 pesos a month.

  [Text] The 1993 to 1994 sugar harvest is considered "vital" 
to halt the deterioration that has characterized Cuba's economy 
for several years and to begin a modest upward trend, an 
editorial for the weekly TRABAJADORES, mouthpiece of the Cuban 
Workers Federation [CTC], reports today. 
  It recalls that the sugar industry represents the main 
source 
of income for the island and that it is also "the measure of the 
nation's pulse, a crucial parameter on which all eyes are 
directed, with or without reason, to make a diagnosis" of the 
current economic situation. 
  The production goals for this harvest, which does not end 
until June, only exceeds by several hundred thousand tons the 
previous harvest of 4.2 million tons, the second smallest in the 
past 30 years, according to the CTC. 
  It also considers the effect the drop in sugar production in 
1993 may have had, both on the island and abroad. This 
repercussion was even more intense than the fact that in the 
same year importations were reduced by a little more than 70 
percent compared to 1989. 
  The last sugar harvest netted $700 million, $450 million 
less 
than in previous years. 
  "To produce more sugar than last year and not leave a single 
sugarcane unprocessed is a task that demands unlimited heroism 
and stoicism," the weekly states. 
  Among the negative factors it cites during this harvest are 
a 
lack of tires, batteries, and all kinds of spare parts for the 
harvest, transportation, and the selfsame industry [propia 
industria], a lack of electricity, and an irregular rain pattern. 
  The weekly notes industry and harvest workers have not been 
wearing appropriate clothes or shoes, and their food intake has 
been far below that received in other years to carry out their 
work. 
  It also notes that in May and June efforts were concentrated 
not only in cutting and milling but also in the harvest in order 
to increase sugarcane production levels to those of several 
years ago when results exceeded 8 million tons.

<F P=106> [Report by Marianela Samper; from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The first international seminar on industrial 
property and business possibilities in Cuba has concluded in 
Havana with a positive discussion of experiences by experts and 
specialists from the 14 nations that gathered here. The debate 
was enhanced by topics as important as Latin American 
integration in industrial property [propiedad industrial] and 
what the subcontinent could do in light of the new challenges 
posed by the revamping of the international legal order, which 
is gaining strength. 
  Regarding the use of the patents cooperation agreement, 
which 
began (?in May) 1978 under the auspices of the Intellectual 
Property World Organization [Organizacion Mundial de Propiedad 
Intellectual], the participants discussed some of the advantages 
to the countries that adhere to it, including the right to 
defend claims on inventions in more than 60 countries and the 
extension of the time granted to applicants before entering the 
national phase; these advantages allow for further development 
of the invention, marketing, and facilitate a better financial 
condition in order to meet other expenditures. Here, one needs 
access to an extensive technological bibliography. Jesus 
Sanchez Lima, from the United States, has commented on the 
treaty and the North to South transfer of technology. 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] I look at it from a perspective 
different from other participants in this field, many who 
primarily.... [pauses] regarding the lobbying by the (?First 
World) against the Third World. Though I believe in the patents 
system and think these limited monopolies granted to the 
inventors are the most effective way to stimulate inventions, I 
believe, nonetheless, there must be a limit to those monopolies. 
Those limits in many countries that are forced by economic 
reasons to join treaties like GATT and NAFTA may not yield the 
expected results. [end recording] 
  During the international seminar emphasis was also placed on 
the overlap between copyright or industrial property, which 
provide protection to artistic and literary works, and 
inventions and patent rights. There was a consensus to consider 
a possible legal system, at both the national and international 
levels and to establish the principle of a single right over 
goods and materials. In conclusion, here is the opinion of one 
of the Cuban experts who attended the meeting. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] It has challenged us 
to exercise our intelligence, and by that word I mean the 
intelligence of those who live in Cuba. It has made us think 
beyond what we are used to thinking and even open ourselves to 
the challenges our domestic policy of promoting foreign 
investments in certain sectors are posing. Matters we had not 
considered, including in our legislation, are discussed here as 
the problems other legislations have. They will not be problems 
for our laws, because we have been forewarned. In a general 
sense, the [word indistinct] is highly positive. [end recording] 
  This seminar also served to explore the future report that 
will contain the steps Cuba has been taking against legal 
regulations on industrial property and the expectations it 
offers Latin America by adjusting its laws.

the situation regarding the generation of electricity will 
maintain the same pattern as last week, even though there could 
be fewer outages this weekend with the reinsertion of other 
generators that had been damaged or were under maintenance. The

<F P=106> [Article by Mirta Rodriguez Calderon] </F>
  [Text] Every time the people sit down to eat, an explicit 
or implicit thought goes to the UBPC [Basic Cooperative 
Production Unit] and the rest of the rural producers. 
  The combined expectations placed upon this type of 
production, which assimilates the experience of the Anapistas 
[members of ANAP: National Association of Small Farmers] imply 
the risk of added frustrations (as in the recent case of the 
food program) if the people are not fully aware that it will 
take time--and not just days or even months--before a serious 
dent is made in the frugality of our meals because of the UBPC's. 
  One cannot lose sight of the fact that our cooperative 
workers have inherited an agricultural picture with marked 
shortages of fuel, fertilizer, herbicide, tools, and shoes, a 
costly economic program involving machinery, pumping, and 
irrigation systems (in addition to dams, minidams, and canals), 
combined with an inefficient system of collection worsened by a 
lack of containers and a partially inoperative transport pool. 
  The UBPC members as a whole can decide whether or not to 
acquire this equipment that places such a burden on their 
economy (which is what is happening in some places, where they 
have rejected the FREGAT irrigation machinery, for example, and 
some of the tractors, harvesters, and cane combines). Replacing 
these resources implies efficiency, but also a return to manual 
labor, just as we have had to go back to oxen. This means that 
our aspirations for a high-yield agriculture will have to be 
postponed for who knows how long. 
  It may be worthwhile to note that more than a few experts 
maintain that this should never have been the model chosen for 
Cuba, any more than the gigantic scale of certain factories and 
enterprises. 
  Forced as we are to deal with the situation at hand for the 
time being, what strikes us are the events connected with the 
establishment and first steps of the UBPC's, which promise to 
provide us with a better supply of products from the land and 
within a reasonable period of time. 
  Obviously, what is happening in the fields is closely 
connected with our very survival. 
  This experience of cooperativizing the work, means, and 
production, based on national ownership of the land and 
macroresources (highways and dams), with the state as the sole 
buyer, does entail unknown factors of interest to everyone, 
particularly specialists in agricultural transformations. 
  In other words, it is not only the politicians, economists, 
government officials, and farmers themselves who are impressed 
with the need to continually evaluate the progress of the 
process. Veteran academicians are also sharpening their arsenal 
of scientific tools in order not to lose ground or their footing. 
  Such is the case of the Rural Studies Team of the Department 
of Sociology of the University of La Habana, headed by Dr. 
Niurka Perez Rojas and made up of Dr. Cary Torres Diaz and 
Miriam Garcia Aguilar. Supported by a group of students, the 
three women have been examining the startup of the UBPC's in our 
country and conducted field studies in the municipalities of 
Santo Domingo in Villa Clara and Guines in La Habana. 
  In addition to a solid volume of first-hand information, the 
researchers have evaluated the motivations and individual 
features of the labor force making up the UBPC's. 
  For Professor Perez Rojas, "state-owned agriculture had 
demonstrated inefficiency in terms of stimulating farm workers, 
but also with respect to yield and the organization of work. 
Previous studies done by our team had already demonstrated that 
the farm worker's household had a lower level of monetary income 
than did cooperative members and individual farmers." 
  "The UBPC members are starting from a very difficult 
situation of a state-owned economy that is generally 
unprofitable," Niurka emphasized. "It is an economy in deep 
crisis. This explains why its essential motivation and prime 
priority is to obtain food for the family via accelerated 
development of crops in areas of local consumption and livestock 
modules." 
  "The second expectation identified by our research is the 
possibility of obtaining more monetary income. Although this was 
not articulated, we realized during our interviews that the 
workers also hope to obtain surpluses in time. Being able to 
participate in management and major decisions ranging from the 
election of boards of directors to anything having to do with 
autonomy is the third motivating factor. 
  "Respecting and promoting that autonomy seems to me to be 
extremely important. I was quite concerned when I heard a leader 
in Granma Province tell the members of one UBPC that what was 
important was production rather than earnings. He was saying so 
because that particular UBPC wanted to cut its staff and operate 
with fewer workers than the state enterprise. In my opinion, the 
bottom line of any cooperative is the distribution of profits. 
Without it, there can be no profitability or efficiency. I think 
it is indispensable to respect the fact that it is in fact 
stipulated that they have the power to decide." 
  Another aspiration expressed by UBPC members is the 
possibility of building homes. The researchers believe that this 
motivation ranked fourth because it reveals the understanding of 
the current shortage of resources. 
<H5>  Man and His Work </H5>
  For those seeking conceptual explanations of the phenomena 
of 
reality, the behavior of work forces within the UBPC has 
singular features. 
  "The first distinctive trait of the permanent UBPC work 
force 
is its duality," says Professor Cary Torres. She explains: "As 
long as they use the land and are the owners of the means and 
results of production, they are in fact owners, which gives them 
the right to participate in earnings and decisionmaking. 
However, they are at the same time an effective labor force. 
They are the workers and leaders within the productive process. 
This duality makes them different from salaried workers, both in 
terms of their relationship to the means of production as well 
as their social production." 
  Another important element in the researchers' analysis has 
to 
do with the distinction between "the permanent work force and 
the hired work force, resulting from their different positions 
with respect to the means of production. This lends an element 
of subordination to the hired work force compared with the 
permanent work force, Torres Vila said, because the former do 
not have the advantage of participating in decisionmaking or 
local consumption, housing possibilities when scheduled and 
built, or other benefits. 
  The analysis begun by the Rural Study Team of the School of 
Philosophy and History will also ponder the labor-related 
reaction of cooperative workers (the name given to UBPC 
members). "It is a known fact that when they were state 
agricultural workers," the professors say, "they did not work a 
full eight hours. There was absenteeism and productivity was 
very low. Placed in different conditions providing them with a 
real feeling of belonging, material incentives, and 
participation in decisionmaking, the same individuals have begun 
to react. We have observed that the same workers who performed 
for three or four hours are now doing so for eight or more. We 
also see encouraging signs of improved productivity. If this 
trend continues, the hired labor force and particularly the 
number of mobilized [sic] workers will be minimal." 
<H5>  Many Watching Us </H5>
  Like everything else happening to us now, at a time when so 
many people around the globe want to see us succeed and others 
are predicting the end of our dreams, the implementation of this 
type of agricultural organization is viewed with interest by 
scholars in other parts of the world. 
  The research being done by the Rural Study Team, which has 
just celebrated its tenth anniversary and which was the most 
outstanding collective from the School of Philosophy and History 
both last year and in 1992, is part of an international project 
on Agrarian Transformations in Socialist Countries sponsored by 
the MacCarthur [sic] Foundation in the United States. 
  The academicians heading up the study in Cuba are American 
economist Carmen Diana Deere, professor at the University of 
Massachusetts, and Cubans Niurka Perez Rojas and Ernel Gonzalez, 
who heads the University of La Habana's Department of Sociology. 
In an article to be published in the coming issue of the British 
Cambridge University's JOURNAL OF PEASANTS STUDIES, the three 
scholars maintain, among other things, that: 
  "Given the conditions of the special period, when nearly all 
types of food and other consumer goods are once again rationed, 
other incentives are needed in addition to linking pay to 
productivity in order to achieve a greater work effort and 
stabilize the size of the farm work force. With the considerable 
cut in the quantity and frequency with which many food 
products--including eggs, barnyard poultry, milk, and cooking 
oil are distributed--the sale of food to workers and the quality 
and diversity of the meals served in farm cafeterias have turned 
into incentives as important as wages paid in money. 
  "While it is still too soon to evaluate this dramatic 
reorganization of the Cuban state-owned farm sector," say the 
authors of the research report soon to appear in the British 
periodical, "it became clear in the interviews conducted that it 
has generated considerable optimism among workers as well as 
administrators, particularly in terms of the recovery of sugar 
cane production. UBPC members report that they certainly feel 
like `owners' and are working longer days with greater 
intensity. They are taking better care, not only of the land, 
but also of their machinery and implements." 
<H5>  Beyond Desires </H5>
  It is certainly premature to make any further evaluations of 
the UBPC's and their future. In addition to positive desires, it 
is praiseworthy that the CPA's [Agricultural-Livestock 
Cooperatives] should transfer their experience and that the ANAP 
should help prevent the exodus of the UBPC skilled work force, 
as they are now doing. 
  It is also to be hoped that the UBPC's that grow a variety 
of 
crops will beware of the evils of disproportion that afflicted 
state agriculture: far too much cabbage and too few beans, large 
quantities of turnips and eggplant and too little rice. 
Political factors having to do with prices and plans that take 
the people rather than figures into consideration must also play 
a role. 
  Now that the people have scanned the horizon of the most 
noteworthy positive and negative factors, hope prevails. And 
time must be allowed to do its work.

<F P=106> [Report by Susana del Calvo from Pinar del Rio; from the </F>
"Evening Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] We toured Cuba's westernmost province, Pinar del 
Rio, whose capital city has become the seat of the region's 
International Labor Day festivities. The traditional joyful 
spirit of the Cuban people was present at the parade staged by 
thousands of workers, representing the many production sectors 
of Pinar del Rio. The younger generations were also present at 
this honorable function of the nation to reaffirm our 
revolutionary conviction. 
  In an opening speech, Bernardo Oliva, secretary general of 
the Pinar del Rio chapter of the Cuban Workers Federation, said 
more than 40,000 people from Pinar del Rio were doing voluntary 
agricultural work. Pinar del Rio has recently shown a certain 
degree of improvement, as manufacturing increased by 26.2 
percent and services grew by 35 percent in comparison with the 
first quarter of 1993. Local industry, in accordance with the 
current trend, has grown by more than 92 percent and the child 
mortality rate has been lowered to 8.8 deaths per 1,000 live 
births. The Pinar del Rio workers movement has donated more 
than 1 million pesos in aid for financing of territorial 
militias. This again demonstrates the Cuban workers' 
determination to defend their achievements with their own blood, 
if necessary. 
  The weather on this beautiful, tropical day was kind to the 
men and women who marked International Labor Day on 30 April, so 
they can follow the sessions of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government on 1 May via the local radio and television 
stations. Workers from other parts of the world also marched in 
Pinar del Rio to celebrate their day with us today. One such 
group is the U.S.-based Venceremos Brigade, which is working on 
the tobacco harvest in protest of the embargo against our 
country. 
  In conclusion, I would like to say the most significant 
thing 
here is the contagious, joyful spirit of the Pinar del Rio 
workers as they celebrate 1 May.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments through 27 April: 
  Cuban and Mexican businessmen have agreed to establish a 
joint enterprise in the textile sector and to increase their 
business operations in more than 10 other areas. Diego 
Fernandez, spokesman for a delegation of Mexican businessmen 
visiting Havana, said 75 percent of the textile enterprise will 
be Mexican-owned. The 40 firms represented in the Mexican 
delegation will be able to sell perfumes, cosmetics, 
construction materials, canned juices, cookies, chocolates, 
fertilizers, insecticides, and chemical and pharmaceutical 
products in Cuba. Cuban firms will sell resins and marble for 
construction in the Mexican market. Mexico's annual sales to 
Cuba, especially products for the service sector, amount to 
approximately $124 million. Mexico imports about $7 million 
worth of nickel and tobacco from Cuba annually. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 0509 GMT 21 Apr 94) 
  Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 23 April reports that 915 Basic 
Cooperative Production Units (UBPC), with almost 90,000 members, 
have been formed nationwide in the agriculture-livestock sector. 
Salvador Valdez, secretary general of that sector's union, says 
that it is anticipated that there will eventually be 2,300 of 
these structures in that sector. 
  In the same newscast, Rebelde announces that the work group 
of the Australia Sugar Mill in Jaguey Grande has been awarded 
the Labor Feat banner. The Australia is the first 
sugar-producing complex in Matanzas Province to fulfill its 
production plans for the current harvest. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 22 April reports that a factory 
run by the union of nickel enterprises in Moa Municipality, 
Holguin Province, makes "somewhat more than 1,000 kg of pigments 
per month for the construction materials industry." These 
pigments, obtained from nickel industry wastes, replace those 
Cuba has been importing for the production of tiles and toilet 
fixtures. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 25 April reports that the 
low-capacity generator factory in Cacocum Municipality, Holguin 
Province, has already produced 200 generators with PRC 
technology. The report adds that this factory, the only one of 
its kind in Cuba, is in the final stage of construction. The 
plant will produce 23 kinds of generators of capacities ranging 
from 0.55 to 15 kw. It aims to produce 30,000 units yearly. Once 
the local demand for these ?MT on 26 April reports that a metal 
recycling factory in Havana has experienced a decrease in its 
supply of scrap metal. Last year it recycled only 10 percent of 
the amount it recycled in 1990. In the first quarter of 1994, 
the nonferrous metals recycled have been less than 1 percent of 
the amount recycled in the same period in 1990. This recycling 
plant supplies approximately 50 other factories that use 
recycled metals. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1406 GMT on 26 April reports that the 
Espana 
Republicana Sugar Mill in Perico Municipality, Matanzas 
Province, has thrown away 5,000 liters of the biological 
fertilizer Azospirillum, which had not been picked up and was 
quickly decomposing in the holding tanks. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 26 April reports that the 
months 
of May and June are crucial for the spring planting campaign. So 
far, 4,000 caballerias have been planted -- 76 percent of the 
goal for the January-April period. Over 18,000 caballerias are 
to planted in the first half of 1994; it is therefore important 
to stay on the planting schedule during the next two months. 
  Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 26 April reports that 
combine-harvester operator Carlos Nunez of platoon number six 
which provides sugar cane for the Hector Rodriguez sugar 
agroindustrial complex in Sagua la Grande, Villa Clara Province, 
was the first to cut 2 million arrobas of cane. Carlos Nunez is 
one of the most outstanding producers in the country during the 
current harvest, cutting more than 16,000 arrobas daily. He 
reached 2 million arrobas in 110 working days. Nunez expects to 
cut 100,000 arrobas more before the end of the harvest in 
northern Villa Clara. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 27 
April 
report that, despite efforts by farmers in Matanzas, the potato 
harvest of that province did not reach the expected levels due 
to the infestations that affected the crops and the high 
humidity of the soil. The current harvest has been the worse of 
the past years. With only 20 caballerias left to harvest, 
approximately 500,000 quintals of potatoes have been harvested, 
which means that the final results will be short of the goal of 
760,000 quintals for the people's consumption. According to 
estimates, the average yield will be 4,000 quintals per 
caballeria, which is short of the goal and of what the province 
traditionally obtains. So far, 100,000 quintals have been sent 
to Santiago de Cuba and 170,000 quintals are in cold storage 
centers. 
  Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 27 April reports that sugarcane 
planting will be intensified in Camaguey with the mobilization 
of thousands of workers toward that objective. From January to 
date, the province has planted 460 caballerias; the goal is to 
conclude the year with 1,189 caballerias of sugarcane. Recent 
rains and the dampness of the soil will accelerate seed 
germination. 
  In the same newscast, Radio Reloj adds that the Segundo Diaz 
Prado UBPC in Caimito, Havana Province, will try to improve 
sugarcane production for the next harvest. Adolfo Lozada, 
president of the unit, has told this station that most cane 
plantations are just sprouting and for this reason workers must 
accelerate cleaning and planting activities because, for the 
time being, they have no fertilizer. He added that the main 
problem is the need to build more houses for workers.

<F P=106> [Article by Armando Gruber] </F>
  [Text] San Felix--Retired Lieutenant Colonel Francisco 
Arias Cardenas said here during a visit to the Caroni 
Municipality mayor's office that the struggles or differences 
between Radical Cause [CR] and Hugo Chavez and the MBR-200 
[Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement-200] only benefit directly 
the traditional parties like AD [Democratic Action] and COPEI 
[Social Christian Party]. 
  Arias Cardenas does not see why these two political currents 
have to oppose each other and fears that there could be persons 
interested in creating frictions involved. 
  Flanked by CR Senator Lucas Matheus, Mayor Clemente Scotto, 
and city councillors Simon Yegres (CR) and Davis Odreman (AD), 
Arias Cardenas added: "There are individuals disguised as 
revolutionaries who are promoting these confrontations, and I 
see that they are very interested in creating conflicts." 
  "There should be respect, and agreement is vital. We should 
remember the sixties and the fratricidal struggles within the 
left in this country." 
  Arias Cardenas insisted on the need for President Rafael 
Caldera to continue to take rapid action to complete the process 
of freeing many of the officers who rebelled on 27 November 
[1992] and some of those from 4 February [1992] who may still be 
under arrest, and also the need to seek the reintegration of 
many young officers into the ranks of the FAN [National Armed 
Forces]. 
  "Many of those who participated in those movements on 4 
February and 27 November--such as Admiral Cabrera, General 
Visconti, and Colonels Dominguez and Garrido--did so with the 
firm desire to rebel against a corrupt government that had no 
legitimacy. There are a large number of higher-ranking junior 
officers, and it is vital to listen to and hear them." 
  [Gruber] What do you think is hindering the process? 
  "Good will, which is extremely important. I do not know the 
details of what may be happening, so I found it necessary to 
postpone until next week my meeting with Andres Caldera, the 
minister secretary of the presidency. There are situations such 
as, for example, officers who were discharged with questionable 
procedures, from a legal point of view. This must be taken into 
account." 
  On the possibility of being appointed director of PAMI 
[Mother-Child Food Program] by the government of President 
Rafael Caldera, Arias Cardenas said: "The fundamental basis for 
accepting jobs or working is to feel fulfilled by what one is 
doing. This government is not the same as or like the previous 
one, nor is it an AD government." 
  "I would have to evaluate it very carefully in view of the 
opportunities for contributing, for serving, and being useful to 
the community. In addition, I have a responsibility toward those 
officers who went along with me in rebelling, believing in my 
military leadership, and now are unemployed." 
  "This government is different from the previous ones, and 
will have its critics, its problems. I would have to evaluate it 
[the appointment] also with the possibility that I would be 
forbidden to speak with the freedom with which I am speaking 
now."

  [Text] Caracas, 1 May (EFE) -- Antonio Casas Gonzalez, who 
was appointed new president of Banco Central of Venezuela (BCV), 
took office today, Sunday, and called an urgent meeting of the 
bank's board of directors. 
  Casas Gonzalez was appointed BCV president after the 
unexpected 26 April resignation of Ruth de Krivoy, who held that 
post for the past two years. 
  Krivoy resigned alleging deep differences with the way the 
government had handled the delicate financial crisis in 
mid-January when Banco Latino, the country's second most 
important one at the time, was intervened. 
  After the Latino Bank crisis, an additional eight banks had 
to receive assistance of the state, which diverted almost 5 
billion [currency unspecified] in financial aid to prevent a 
massive bankruptcy of banks. 
  During the past weeks President Rafael Caldera assigned 
Gustavo Roosen, intervener of Banco Latino, to design a plan 
that will restore confidence in the financial system and lower 
the ceiling on interest rates, which is over 60 percent. 
  This decision by Caldera and other decisions by Roosen to 
carry out the assigned task were viewed by Krivoy as state 
interference in monetary policy affairs, which Venezuelan laws 
reserve for the BCV and, therefore, shows a lack of respect for 
the bank's autonomy. 
  After learning of Krivoy's resignation, the government and 
Senate agreed to appoint Casas Gonzalez, who up until that time 
had represented the state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum before the 
British Government and other European countries. 
  Following Krivoy's resignation, the local stock market got 
out of control "completely, and the Venezuelan bolivar suffered" 
a heavy devaluation compared to the U.S. dollar. This will be 
the first problem the new BCV authorities will resolve. 
  Economists Domingo Maza Zavala and Miguel Ignacio Purroy and 
Casas Gonzalez were sworn in as new BCV directors. 
  Casas Gonzalez, an economist, was deputy minister of 
development between 1969 and 1972 and planning minister between 
1972 and 1974, both times under the Caldera administration. The 
Senate unanimously supported his appointment as BCV president.

<F P=106> [Report by Luisa Amelia Rodriguez from the "National </F>
Newscast"] 
  [Text] The Technical Judicial Police [PTJ] have ruled out 
terrorism in this morning's bomb blast, which occurred at 0642 
on the No. 1207 Caracas subway train. At the time of the blast, 
the subway train was moving westward and headed toward the 
Parque del Este station. Five people were injured in the 
explosion. 
  As we announced during our noon newscast, PTJ investigations 
are currently centered on a group of youngsters believed to be 
students at the Don Bosco Industrial Vocational School. 
Witnesses reported that they had seen the students behaving 
oddly in the subway car in which the explosion took place. The 
students left the subway train at the Los Cortijos station just 
a few minutes before the pipe bomb exploded. 
  PTJ Chief of Homicide Leonardo Pia Baruta has the following 
explanation: 
  [Begin recording] [Baruta] At this time, the Homicide 
Division is continuing its investigation into the explosive 
device [words indistinct] in which four [as heard] people were 
slightly injured. We have collected some evidence, such as 
leaflets that had been scattered throughout the subway car. We 
also collected some of the residue of the chemicals used in the 
bomb. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Could this incident be interpreted 
as 
a reactivation of terrorist activities in our country? 
  [Baruta] In no way whatsoever. We cannot speak about 
terrorism or anything of the sort. I would prefer to associate 
it with a student protest. It was probably caused by some 
youngsters who, as a result of their immaturity and youth, 
detonated this pipe bomb. [end recording] 
  In this way, the PTJ has ruled out the hypothesis that 
terrorism was behind the Caracas subway explosion.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 2 May (DPA) -- The violent electoral 
campaign in the Dominican Republic has claimed two more victims, 
who were shot dead yesterday during an incident in which 17 more 
persons were wounded. Those who died were followers of the 
Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) who were participating in a 
large caravan that was attacked by unidentified assailants. 
  The dead individuals are Dr. Edgard de la Rosa, 29, and 
Nelson Nunez, 44. It was reported that Nunez was the bodyguard 
of Joaquin Sanchez, who is the PRD candidate for mayor of La 
Vega. 
  The PRD accused the followers of President Joaquin Balaguer 
and of the ruling Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) of 
having opened fire on the caravan with heavy-caliber weapons. 
Spokesmen for the opposition party said that since the campaign 
began last 16 March, seven of their followers have been murdered 
in various places and over 100 have been injured. 
  Today, PRD presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez 
urged the PRSC and President Balaguer to sign a pact to halt 
violence and "prevent further bloodshed after the 16 May 
elections." Pena Gomez also proposed that none of the parties 
that will participate in the elections declare victory before 
the Central Electoral Board (JCE) makes the official 
announcement. The PRD also asked the Catholic Church to mediate 
so that this pact be signed and "no Dominican fall victim to 
political violence." 
  On 24 April, a 23-year-old woman was shot twice in the head 
and killed when a PRD caravan was attacked in one sector of 
Santo Domingo. Yesterday's incident occurred after the 
conclusion of a PRD regional meeting when a large number of 
followers were returning to La Vega. The shots were apparently 
made with an automatic weapon. The wounded were taken to 
hospitals in La Vega and Santiago. La Vega is some 160 km north 
of Santo Domingo.

given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Following the inauguration ceremony for new Mayor of 
San Salvador Mario Valiente, of the Nationalist Republican 
Alliance, President Cristiani held a news conference to state 
how positive he finds the constitutional reforms approved on 29 
April by the outgoing Legislative Assembly. This is what 
President Cristiani had to say: 
  [Begin recording] [Cristiani] I have not had a chance to 
examine each of the reforms as they were approved on 29 April. 
I understand, however, they acted on basically the same issues 
they had been discussing. I believe they address the audits 
carried out by the Court of Accounts [Corte de Cuentas], certain 
privileges, state monopolies, and, of course, several issues 
concerning the judicial branch. Generally speaking, and again 
without knowing what exactly was changed, I believe the changes 
are positive. 
  Concerning the workers' request, it concerns only state 
workers, whom the Constitution withholds the right to declare 
strikes. This situation is not unique to El Salvador alone. I 
believe many countries withhold this prerogative, which is 
common to employees of the private sector, due to the nature of 
the tasks assigned to public employees, whose job is to serve 
the nation. Should public employees declare a strike, it would 
deprive people of the service to which they are entitled. We 
already saw what happened when public employees went on strike: 
The Rosales Hospital was shut down and caused much distress 
among the people. 
  In another turn of events, treasury funds are not for the 
benefit of one individual in particular; they belong to the 
people, and they must return to the people. Many of the things 
common to the private sector [four-second break in reception] 
such a decision attempts against the resources of a specific 
enterprise. It is not Salvadorans' money. There must be a 
balance. In short, I believe this constitutional article must 
be left untouched for now. 
  Concerning the Fuertes Caminos exercise, arrangements are 
under way. U.S. engineers, along with our engineers, will 
continue to do the same type of works they did during the first 
phase. This second phase is larger, however, because more works 
will be done. We hope many of the communities that were chosen 
to have health centers, schools, and other infrastructure works, 
such as wells, built there will benefit from these works. 
  [Reporter Mario Jovel] Good morning, Mr. President. The U.S. 
observers who came here during the elections on 29 April asked 
the U.S. Congress to unfreeze economic aid to ensure that peace 
agreements will be complied with. My question is how much aid 
does the country need to comply with the remaining peace 
agreements? 
  [Cristiani] In general terms, AID has supported such 
programs 
to rejoin public life, such as the land distribution plan and 
other plans to train mini- and small-scale businessmen. The 
land distribution program lacks financing, however, that is, it 
lacks the necessary resources in order to be carried out. 
  On the other hand, perhaps most of the aid to the PNC, 
especially the National Public Security Academy, is not in cash 
but, rather, in the form of advisers, trainers, vehicles yet to 
be delivered, and others. We need to continue this program, but 
I cannot estimate the exact amount we need, but the land 
distribution program requires large sums of money. The lack of 
funds for this program pertains to the 100 million colones. It 
is obvious that if the resources needed do not come from abroad, 
we will have to find a way to provide them domestically. 
  [Reporter Ruben Dominguez] Mr. President, today we mark May 
Day. Could you please send a message to all Salvadoran workers? 
  [Cristiani] The Salvadoran people are known as hardworking 
people, and we observe International Labor Day today. We send 
our most cordial salute to all Salvadoran workers who are 
enjoying, along with their families, some type of recreation, 
perhaps in the countryside, because today is Sunday. We hope 
this is the right time to regain strength to continue to work 
for El Salvador. [end recording]

man who was near Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential 
candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD]. The man 
claimed that he was going to be robbed. Here is a report: 
  [Reporter] As Perez Balladares was walking down from stage 
No. 1 on Balboa Avenue, his security forces subdued a man who 
pulled a gun. Electoral officials were called and, following 
consultations, the Police arrested the unidentified man. 
  [Begin PRD leader Francisco Sanchez recording] A man who was 
standing about 2 meters from our candidate, Dr. Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, pulled out a gun. Thank God our security forces did 
a good job and arrested him. We will file charges. The 
electoral delegates took this man to their headquarters to 
investigate the incident. We regret this incident and urge all 
citizens and our opponents to avoid actions of this sort, 
because they will bring no good to Panama. [end recording]

  [Text] Yesterday President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said 
that the DEA works and must continue to work in a coordinated 
manner with the national institutions and abiding by the 
Bolivian laws. 
  In response to the concern expressed by several sectors 
regarding the alleged interference by foreign agents or 
organizations in domestic affairs, the president explained: "We 
are getting the DEA to work in a coordinated manner with the 
Bolivian institutions, abiding by the national laws." 
  The chief of state said that at a personal and diplomatic 
level he clearly stated that the orders must come from Bolivia, 
as we are waging a great joint struggle against drug trafficking 
and for this need U.S. support. 
  The president said: "We need U.S. assistance, but it should 
be granted within a framework of mutual respect and the 
effectiveness that stems from adequate coordination." 
  In Sanchez de Lozada's opinion, the DEA has heard the 
criticisms from various sectors of the country, and he believes 
it has understood the rules of the game. 
  He stated, however, that as a result of these criticisms he 
is not going to adopt a chauvinist attitude nor seek to easily 
gain popularity by criticizing the United States for what has 
happened. 
  The DEA's work in Bolivia is being questioned by political 
and social sectors, among them the Church, which believe that 
the DEA is violating Bolivian sovereignty. 
  U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia Charles Bower was the first U.S. 
Government authority to answer these expressions of concern, 
stating that there are no signs of interference in domestic 
affairs.

  [Text] Irritated with the slowness of the constitutional 
revision, Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Mario Cesar Flores 
on 28 April predicted the risk of a rupture between the 
executive, legislative, and judicial branches during the next 
administration if the legal order does not change. For him, 
whoever wins the elections will "be suffocated by the legal 
order, opposed by the congressional majority." In a categorical 
speech he delivered at BNDES [National Bank for Economic and 
Social Development] headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, the minister 
asserted that the executive branch is currently "handcuffed, 
limited in its actions by the legal intervention of the other 
government branches." 
  "With the juridical order we have, this administration, the 
former one, the one before that, and the next one cannot govern. 
The federal government was depleted while the states and 
municipalities benefited. This will not change with the 
elections. I fear that the situation may become worse after the 
elections because whoever wins the elections will hardly hold a 
majority in Congress." 
  Flores labeled the rural congressional bloc corporative, 
and, 
in protest against the maneuver that prevented the voting 
session on the provisional measure creating the URV [Real Value 
Unit], the admiral sent a message that seemed to include a 
threat during the "Governability and Political System" debate: 
  "We have been living for the past 10 to 12 years under an 
agreeable armistice that is part of our political culture, but 
it is not an unconditional surrender. We need a longlasting 
armistice that will lead us to peace." 
  The energetic speech by Flores, who also said the political 
parties have become "hostages of corporations within a suicidal 
congressional mechanism," surprised the rest of the speakers 
who, although admitting the governability crisis, wanted to 
avoid preaching chaos: 
  "I feel horror over those catastrophic forecasts," said 
former Minister Joao Paulo dos Reis Velloso, superintendent of 
the National Higher Studies Institute, after the debate. 
  Deputy Paulo Delgado (PT-MG) [Workers Party-Minas Gerais] 
thought Flores "exaggerated somewhat in his speech:" 
  This demonstrates a difficult situation: the impasse in 
Congress as a result of the explosive combination of the 
stabilization plan, the constitutional revision, and the 
elections.

  [Text] On 15 April in Marrakech, Morocco, with a rap of his 
gavel on the lectern, the chairman of the Uruguay Round of the 
GATT trade talks, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu, 
closed the thorny process of tough negotiations on the new rules 
for world trade, which had lasted seven years. A transitional 
stage that is to be concluded on 1 January 1995 with the 
institutionalization of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO)--which will replace GATT in the settlement of problems 
arising from international trade in goods and services--began 
there, too. 
  Having signed on this occasion the Final Declaration of the 
Uruguay Round launched in Punta del Este [Uruguay] in 1986, the 
representatives from 124 countries burst into applause. 
  During the transition to the WTO, a Preparatory Committee 
will once again have to make great conciliatory efforts to 
harmonize different demands on issues such as labor regulations, 
regional agreements, relations between trade and monetary 
policies, immigration, countries' external debts, trade 
practices, and even the alleviation of poverty. 
  Several bilateral agreements, which were signed at the very 
last minute, provided for the mutual granting of compensatory 
concessions to member countries or groups of member countries. 
  Abreu said that following lengthy negotiations "there are 
absolutely no victors nor vanquished." He underscored that 
countries had made concessions to one another "which obviously 
vary in importance according to the blocs involved." 
<H5>  Achievements by Uruguay </H5>
  Uruguay--which already has a rather open economy--did not 
have to make specific bilateral concession to other countries. 
Nevertheless, the results of the meeting fell far short of the 
expectations Uruguay and the other Cairns Group (exporters of 
nonsubsidized agricultural and livestock products) member 
countries had concerning the opening of international trade and 
the reduction of subsidies to production. 
  Notwithstanding this, Uruguay obtained several specific 
trade 
benefits, and will be able to take advantage of the gains 
derived from the greater global opening established by the new 
regulations. The main achievements for Uruguay are: 
  Concessions by the United States 
  -- Tops [preceding word in English]: 50 percent tariff 
reduction. 
  -- Plain weave textiles: 30 percent tariff reduction. 
  -- Garments made of woven fabric: 20 percent tariff 
reduction 
  -- Knitwear: 10 percent tariff reduction. 
  -- Cheese: 10 percent tariff reduction. 
  -- Beef: An annual quota of 20,000 tonnes; a maximum 10 
percent tariff will be levied on beef exports, which will 
materialize once the country is certified as free of 
foot-and-mouth disease. 
  -- Corned beef and salted beef: Zero tariff is maintained. 
  -- Dressed meat: Up to 75 percent tariff reduction. 
  Concessions by the European Union [EU] 
  -- Beef: A 2,000 tonne increase in the Hilton quota 
assigned to Uruguay, which now totals 6,300 tonnes. 
  -- Mutton: Quota is increased from 5,220 to 5,800 tonnes 
with zero tariff. 
  -- Dairy products: General increase in quotas and tariff 
reduction in nearly all products. 
  -- Textiles: Up to 14 percent tariff reduction. 
  Rice Market 
  -- Uruguay will be able to vie for a share in the 380,000 
tonnes that Japan agreed to import as part of a general opening 
and in the 150,000 tonnes the ROK is going to import. This quota 
for both countries will be increased to 1.1 million tonnes in 
six years. 
  General Benefits 
  Uruguay's exports will benefit from the global opening of 
and 
boost in trade that is expected to take place worldwide in 
several aspects: 
  -- Tariffs: Tariffs levied by the EU on agricultural and 
industrial products will go down by 35 percent and 42 percent 
respectively. Tariffs levied by the United States on 
agricultural and industrial products will be reduced by 34.2 
percent and 37.5 percent respectively. Tariffs levied by Japan 
on agricultural and industrial products will be cut by 43.5 
percent and 77.5 percent respectively. 
  -- Domestic Price Support: A 20 percent progressive 
reduction in domestic support prices by industrial countries 
over a period of six years and a 13.3 percent reduction by 
developing countries. 
  -- Subsidies to Exports: A reduction in budgeted 
allocations and volumes of 36 percent and 21 percent 
respectively by industrial countries and 24 percent and 14 
percent respectively by developing countries. 
  -- Nontariff barriers: Quotas, statistic or variable 
rates, etc., will be quantified as tariffs and will be 
progressively reduced by 36 percent in industrial countries and 
by 24 percent in developing countries over a period of six years. 
  -- Animal and plant health agreement: Codes to regulate 
the control of animal and plant health are signed, thus 
preventing the implementation of discriminatory measures that 
act as nontariff barriers. 
  -- Consolidated tariff: A maximum level of 35 percent is 
set.

<F P=106> [Address by President Fidel Castro to the special session of </F>
the National Assembly of the People's Government, ANPP, at the 
Convention Center in Havana, on 1 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Alarcon, if I may make some comments. 
  I see this progressing well because everyone is speaking and 
expressing their ideas and points of view. We do have time, 
because there is no time limit on this session. 
  It is good, and I believe that this is somewhat the way it 
is 
taking place: We are discussing the essence of the issues. 
Although I have a different opinion on what Osvaldo [Martinez] 
says about money hoarders and others. I spoke because those who 
drafted the resolution bill do not at all link money hoarders 
and the change of currency. There are many other reasons for the 
currency change, justifying it or not. The change of currency is 
among the arsenal of measures we can take. 
  I believe that we have to withhold for ourselves the right 
to 
the highest possible number of alternatives in order to find a 
solution to this problem. I truly believe that it is not 
worthwhile to do anything halfway. If the measures are 
inadequate, it would be a disaster. As Osvaldo himself said, the 
problem can replicate itself and that would be worse. This is a 
cancer whose origin we know and which we cannot overlook; it is 
the special period we are confronting. This is why it is called 
a special period. The factors that gave rise to this period are 
still present. It has been an extraordinary deed, resisting as 
we have resisted; but it brings consequences. 
  A humane policy, a policy of solidarity with the people, a 
policy of not leaving anyone abandoned had logically to result 
in a currency excess. That was endurable for a while. However, 
within the special period, the time has come when the problem of 
excess currency has to be solved in the special period. This is 
not so easy, although several judicious comrades have said, yes, 
we have to increase production and services. That is a truism. 
However, we need raw materials, hard currency to buy those raw 
materials, spare parts, oil, and other things. 
  I want to stress that everything described so far is not 
solvable with a ton of fuel. We are not talking about fuel. We 
are talking about the currency excess, a problem we have to 
solve within the special period and in order to try to overcome 
the special period. This is why we should not do anything 
halfway. If we are going to do things halfway, it is better to 
do nothing. We have to solve the problem. Solving the problem 
requires calculating well what we can and ought to do so that 
the problem does not recur. It would be a great waste of time. 
This is why we must have available the entire arsenal of 
measures needed to fulfill the principle of not letting the 
problem reproduce. In other words, this cancer created under the 
special period conditions cannot be allowed to replicate. Its 
roots must be removed. We have to seek not only a balance but 
also to know how long it will take to reach that balance and how 
we are going to shrink it. How to shrink the imbalance. How to 
do so in a definitive manner. 
  This is not easy. I believe one of the most difficult things 
we can contemplate is finding a solution to the problem of 
domestic finances under the special period conditions. We have 
to be truly creative. Gladys [Bejerano] said that the people 
understand. That is true. Their awareness is broader every day. 
Every meeting held has contributed to this. From the beginning, 
it was said that we did not want to solve this overnight from a 
governmental level, as is done everywhere else in the world, 
without debating anything with anybody. We brought the problem 
to the National Assembly. This was not enough. We brought it 
before the people, the masses. It has been discussed by the 
masses. We are discussing it here, once again. We have made the 
discussion extremely broad. 
  These are issues not easily discussed in public. I still 
have 
the hope that we are in a position to make the best decisions in 
the end without letting the most brilliant of the money hoarders 
-- that new character who has emerged, an old character who now 
has gained new life -- without letting the cleverest among the 
clever, or the best hustler among hustlers, come up with some 
way to escape with impunity despite the fact that we have done 
what nobody else has: We have publicly discussed the problem. 
  I have seen such comments on the television, which have made 
me ask myself: If I were a money hoarder, what would I do? Some 
have said....[pauses] The theoreticians have spoken. We have 
bunches of theoreticians. First, we have the true theoreticians; 
second, the theoreticians who believe themselves theoreticians, 
the nontheoreticians who believe themselves theoreticians; and 
third, all the rest who believe themselves theoreticians and 
experts. They have been inventing things, and are trying to 
divine our thoughts. 
  We have to discuss with the greatest democracy in the world 
and, at the same time, keep a certain discretion and the most 
private secrets of our minds. 
  I was saying that Gladys mentioned the awareness that has 
developed, thanks to the scope and level of the discussions. 
This problem has been discussed by millions of people. Problems 
which, anywhere else in the world, only a few experts and 
specialists discuss: That is it. 
  Certainly, we have made progress; but we are still far from 
having a full understanding of the problem. Certain 
well-prepared comrades here have demonstrated this because not 
even they have a full understanding of the problem. Many people 
do not understand yet. This is logical because the problem is 
very technical and complex. Even here, we hear phrases that make 
us want to laugh. Everyone agrees on the need to find solutions; 
but no one wants a tax on his wages, not a cent cut. Everyone 
agrees with streamlining finances; yet the flow of money in the 
form of salaries is enormous. No one wants that cut. Students do 
not want their stipends cut. They are willing to give up their 
lives 15 times for the Revolution, socialism, and the 
streamlining of finances -- but they do not want to hear about 
their stipends being cut. 
  Their stipends are used even to buy goods in the black 
market 
-- they acknowledged this with much honesty -- or to go see 
their girl friends, or do something more vital such as visiting 
a sick relative. I am not saying that seeing their girl friends 
is not vital. I am saying that visiting a sick relative is, 
generally, more vital. They just do not want their stipends cut. 
  I have heard others say, right here, that we have to find 
formulas to be able to deregulate cigarettes so that there are 
enough for everyone at a reasonable price. These are truly 
unique hopes. We could spare ourselves the entire meeting and 
say: We are done; the solution is clear; we have to find 
abundant things at reasonable prices. 
  Many want an increase in cigarette prices. The earlier 
comment by a comrade about the pain of seeing people living off 
the sale of their cigarette quota is true. Yet, there are many 
others who do not want cigarette prices increased. We spoke 
about beer. There was not even a sound, because there is no 
beer. However, when we spoke about rum there were rumblings. 
Everyone would like to streamline the finances but keep the 
goodies. 
  Two comrades spoke about reasonable tobacco prices. I could 
ask: What is a reasonable price so that, in addition, there is 
enough for everyone and it is sold freely? Does anyone know 
this? We will have simply to calculate the packs, this and that, 
current production, future production, this year's harvest, and 
so on. 
  We cannot say that we are truly ready. That is the truth. No 
one doubts that everyone wants solutions; but, at the same time, 
when one studies each case, they want the solutions without 
having to take that kind of measure. This is why we have to be 
very aware that the measures are hard and they have to be taken 
in order to solve the problem and not stop halfway. Otherwise, 
everything we are doing is not worth the effort. 
  The measures we have to take under these special period 
conditions are difficult measures. It is necessary to have the 
most widespread understanding. This is what we have been trying 
to do. We cannot doubt here for a moment the spirit and intent 
of the comrades participating in this assembly. I see a purity 
and dignity, a complete commitment, and a desire to find 
solutions. I do not harbor doubts on the behavior of the 
assembly, the workers' movement, or the mass organizations' 
support for these measures, measures we must take. We have no 
other choice because they are part of the special period. The 
special period, upholding a humane point of view, had inevitably 
to result in the currency excess. 
  This was studied long before the special period, when the 
possibilities of a total blockade against Cuba were studied. 
This resulted in the special period in time of war. Later came 
the special period in time of peace. It was the same thing. We 
underwent a double blockade. The one from the Yankees 
intensified, and trade with the socialist bloc and the former 
USSR disappeared. That is the reality. What was left of that 
market was so little that we can speak of it's disappearing. 
Thus, the situation became even worse than what was conceived as 
a special period in time of war. 
  All these measures had been discussed. It was even discussed 
-- it was not urgent then -- what to do with money during the 
special period. Was money to continue to exist in the special 
period, or was it simply going to be eliminated and goods 
distributed among the population, whatever was available? 
  We never got around to deciding what to do with money. 
However, since this has been a special period, not a regular 
special period or the one we had studied, we were surprised by a 
special period with unique characteristics: The collapse of the 
socialist bloc, collapse of the USSR, complete loss of trade, 
loss of oil supplies, food, raw materials, and all that. The 
special period came without our having reached a decision on 
what to do with money. We could have eliminated money during the 
special period and we would not be here discussing this. There 
would be no money hoarders. There would be barter, exchange of a 
pack of cigarettes for bread or rice or the like. This would 
exist but there would be no money. The idea of money not playing 
any role during the special period was contemplated. 
  However, the special period came gradually, somewhat 
abruptly 
but not overnight as in the case of a naval blockade. We have 
tried, under these conditions, to maintain the normal situation 
of the nation. Money continued to circulate and it accumulated. 
Now, we have the situation of a special period with money, and 
we are discussing what to do with the money. So far, no one has 
suggested eliminating money. On the contrary, suggestions have 
been made to continue the struggle with money. The discussions 
center on what to do with money and how to handle the money 
available. As you can see, we are working to solve the problem 
with the money in existence. 
  I forgot to mention that while we were talking about the 11, 
12, 13, I do not know how many billion pesos, a comrade proposed 
here that the problem be solved by giving incentives to farmers 
and cooperatives. If we were to give the farmers better prices 
than the ones they have now -- those that state collection pays 
them, not that they get in the black market -- every farmer 
would end up being a Rockefeller. They have prices in addition 
to wages. 
  That same comrade also spoke about salaries. On one hand, we 
are discussing what to do with the excess billions; and on the 
other, we are talking about more price incentives. Certain 
theories from the experts, and I include among these Jose Luis 
[Rodriguez], whom we greatly appreciate and are very pleased 
with his address; Osvaldo [Martinez] also....[pauses] I am not 
an expert or anything thing like it, but I have tried to use 
common sense all my life. I ask myself: What taxes will we have 
to pay so that the people openhandedly, generously, and 
massively invest their money in bonds? Or put it all in the 
banks by virtue of the immense interest we are going to pay? I 
do not know if it will be 100, or 200, or 300 percent. Yet they 
want to prevent the cancer from reproducing. If they implement a 
theory of interest rate increases, perhaps in three or four 
years the excess currency will be 20 or 30 billion instead of 11 
or 12. 
  I listen carefully to the experts but I also distrust them 
because at times they can lead us astray. They can lead us to 
implement technocratic policies. This is why, in the end, we 
have do to it with the utmost cooperation of experts, 
politicians, and those assuming the responsibility. Here, we 
must be courageous. Courageous above all, not only intelligent 
but also courageous. If we are afraid, we are lost. If we do 
things halfway, we are lost. History has laid on us the 
responsibility to solve these problems. In the end, we have to 
assume the responsibility and solve the problems with political, 
revolutionary, and technical savvy. 
  There may be things implemented, in the end, as a 
pedagogical 
exercise, for example, charging entry fees at stadiums. Jose 
Luis said that charging for sports would bring in approximately 
4.3 million pesos. I do not know how much -- talk is cheap -- we 
will have to pay to ticket workers to earn four million. Yet, we 
may approve this decision as a matter of principle in order to 
accustom the people, to get them used to pay and appreciate 
things more, to make them more aware of the moment we are 
experiencing, to make the people need money. 
  Since we are keeping money, since we are not going to 
eliminate money, we have to make money be worth something and 
make the people need money. We have no other choice. Otherwise, 
it will happen as a comrade said. We do not have service 
workers. The trained work force is joining the cabbies. There 
are some cabbies making 3,000 pesos, at least in Las Tunas. If 
we manage to collect a good amount of money through diverse 
means, even the cabbies' prices will have to go down because 
there will no longer be people paying 80 cents for a 10-block 
ride. 
  We have to be greatly concerned with salaries. If we truly 
reduce the amount of money in circulation by the various ways 
suggested, we are going to give money back its value. Those 
making 100 pesos today are going to make much more, because even 
what is sold on the streets at abusive prices will have to be 
sold at lower prices. It is not only a matter of streamlining 
finances but of restoring the value of money and salaries. These 
are truly important things. These are crucial things and I 
believe we must be willing to take whatever measures are 
necessary. [applause] 
  Even if, the next morning, no one even wants to greet us. 
[applause] I would add not only next morning, but for months 
after that. None of these will be one-day measures, nor will the 
measures be understood in one day. Only the sum of the measures 
will be understood; only the sum of the measures will yield 
results and increase understanding. 
  The measures must follow an order. It is not a matter of 
taking any one measure today and any other tomorrow. The 
measures have to follow a rigorous order because in this case, 
the order of the factors alters the result. Jose Luis pointed 
out that some measures will, in practice, take months; some will 
take two months, others three. There may be certain measures 
that are not understood by the people when they are first 
implemented. This measure alone is not going to be the solution. 
It is only the first. Later on, they will see a second and, 
perhaps, better understand the first. However, these 
measures....[pauses] The measures have to form a group of 
measures by the time we reach the final decision. They have to 
follow an order and follow an implementation schedule, as well 
as a clear, very clear goal: the goal we have been pointing out 
here. 
  This is not independent of the special period. It requires 
the utmost understanding of the people. This does not mean the 
people are going to be happy with the measures. Some of 
them....[pauses]. 
  Someday, we may have to charge a compounded tax to 
self-employed workers. Self-employment does not convey the right 
to become a millionaire. A self-employed worker with a horse and 
carriage, given the transportation shortages we have in certain 
cities and the abundance of money, allows a cabby to have up to 
five employees. One to take care of the carriage, another the 
horse, another to cut the grass -- a complete bourgeois, who 
does not even want to hear the word tax. 
  Well, this country has to get used to the idea of taxes. 
Nunez Rodriguez spoke about this. About spoiled sons, prodigal 
sons, the generous father. It is true that we have become 
prodigal sons. However, a great majority of our people has an 
awareness and we can tell this because we see them working. With 
what are we paying those who do the harvest, who fight to 
overcome the lack of spare parts, tires, everything, who cut a 
slender cane because they did not get fuel? Are we paying them 
in hard currency? We are paying them in pesos. Those pesos of 
which there is an excess. Yet they are cutting sugarcane right 
now as we debate here -- on 1 May, on a Sunday. 
  Tomorrow, they will also be out there cutting sugarcane. 
Likewise, many people are working at this time. This is the 
majority of our people. [applause] However, there is a dead 
weight that wants to live without working. The healthy side has 
to win over the rotten side. The worker has to win over the idle 
with this group of measures which it is necessary to implement 
at a very difficult time. A time of excess [currency]. 
  This is not the first time the country has had a budget 
deficit or a financial imbalance. These were solved before and 
the people were not even aware of it. Yet, we have to solve this 
imbalance under special period conditions because it is already 
causing great, great damage. 
  With intelligence, perseverance, and courage we must win 
this 
battle, although many will not immediately understand. They will 
understand later. 
  Whatever we do regarding the change of currency mentioned by 
Osvaldo, it is clear that we have to make the people trust our 
banks. We can not fritter away the day, sucking our thumbs. Yes, 
we know what is in and is not in the banks, and when it was 
deposited and when it was not. 
  I remember the first day we spoke about this. I said: This 
is a public battle but there is an art about it. When did we 
first speak about this? When did we broach it again? When, for a 
third time? They are not going to trick us so easily. We have to 
give a differentiated treatment to everyone. This is why we have 
to study it, use intelligence and imagination in order to 
preserve all those values that must be preserved. The most 
important value we have to preserve is the value of the wages of 
the workers. That is the one we have to revalue. The second 
value is that of the worker who made his money honestly. 
  We have to differentiate. How do we do this? We have thought 
much about how to do it. However, you must allow us to keep some 
secrets. In war, you do not say where the division is going to 
strike, nor when, or how many soldiers, pieces of artillery, or 
tanks. This is not divulged. We have said everything that needs 
to be said so that the problem is understood. In the end, we 
must keep to the end the tactics to be used. This is why it is 
not possible to openly and totally discuss the tactics. We have 
discussed here, in general, the goals, the strategy, the things 
being done and why. 
  Please excuse this interruption. It is my greatest wish, and 
that of all of us, to get the most out of this assembly and to 
be aware that what we are discussing is a complex problem, a 
difficult problem, I repeat, which demands political courage 
from the ANPP and the revolutionaries. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas </F>
by Carlos Fernandez, host of the "24 Hours" program, in the 
television network's studio in Caracas--live] 
  [Text] [Fernandez] We are going to be talking with Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas. We will also talk later 
with Pedro Paris Montesinos, Democratic Action president, and 
Aldemaro Romero. Let's begin with Foreign Minister Miguel Angel 
Burelli Rivas. 
  There are several topics of current international interest, 
which, of course, have repercussions in our country. I would 
like to talk first about an important meeting scheduled for 6 
May. President Rafael Caldera will be meeting with Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria, who will be the next OAS secretary 
general, during that meeting. We do not know if there is a 
previously established agenda or if they are going to be talking 
about general topics. I believe that due to the close relations 
between Colombia and Venezuela, a contact between two presidents 
is always important. Welcome, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel 
Burelli Rivas. Let's talk about those details. 
  [Burelli] We invited President Cesar Gaviria to a 6 May 
meeting with our president in Caracas. It will be a working 
meeting exclusively. It will only take place on 6 May. President 
Gaviria will be coming with his entire cabinet. 
  [Fernandez] That is very good. 
  [Burelli] Fourteen ministers will be coming; their 14 
Venezuelan counterparts will also be present. 
  [Fernandez] Have there been recent previous meetings between 
Colombia and Venezuela in which such a large delegation 
participated? 
  [Burelli] Not of this size. The first experience with these 
types of meetings was when I was ambassador to Colombia with 
President-elect Carlos Lleras and Venezuelan President Raul 
Leoni. I brought President-elect Lleras over with some of the 
individuals that were to become his ministers. We held a very 
important and pleasant meeting with them at La Casona 
[presidential residence], but we have never held such a massive 
meeting before. 
  [Fernandez] This type of meeting is important, because, as 
we 
all know, the problems between Colombia and Venezuela are not 
strictly diplomatic in nature. These problems are not limited 
only to the discussions of the delimitation of maritime areas. 
It is a succession of problems and difficulties that both 
countries must face. 
  [Burelli] That is true. We are going to hold bilateral and 
multilateral talks. We are going to talk about all divine and 
human topics, you may say. I want to speak quite frankly. The 
topic of vehicle theft, for example, is apparently a commonplace 
one; the problem of delimitation is a prominent one. Both are 
the alpha and the omega of a long list of well-known topics. 
What we need to do is put the topics in order. Both foreign 
ministers, both defense ministers, and both ministers in charge 
of border affairs will meet in San Cristobal on 29 April to talk 
about the agenda both presidents will discuss. 
  [Fernandez] What fundamental aspects could result from a 
meeting of this type when Gaviria's government is about to turn 
over power? 
  [Burelli] The same results that could be achieved with a new 
Colombian Government. Colombia has a coherent and continuous 
international policy. 
  [Fernandez] That has not been our case. 
  [Burelli] Our international policy is starting to be 
coherent 
and continuous. I would say Venezuela's international policy is 
not the best, but it has not been the worst either. We have lost 
the things we have lost due to Venezuelan policy. 
  [Fernandez] If we look at the past, we realize many of the 
things we have lost have been our responsibility. 
  [Burelli] True. 
  [Fernandez] What fundamental aspects do you think will be 
discussed in this open dialogue between Presidents Rafael 
Caldera and Cesar Gaviria and the members of both cabinets? 
  [Burelli] I would say the fundamental topics are: the 
delimitation of river basins. It is something that is extremely 
important for us, because, as you know, Venezuela is a country 
of river mouths. Venezuela's river sources are located in 
Colombia. The source of the Orinoco River is in Colombia. 
  [Fernandez] That is so important that many analysts of the 
bilateral situation between Colombia and Venezuela are saying 
today the delimitation of maritime areas is less important than 
the delimitation of river basins. 
  [Burelli] Correct. That is many people's opinion. The main 
river of Maracaibo Lake is the Catatumbo River, the source of 
which is in Colombia. You can see the seriousness and importance 
of this topic. We must also talk about the integration that is 
taking place between the two countries, integration which is not 
the greatest but is certainly the most intense from Alaska to 
Patagonia. 
  Shortly, we are going to be trading products worth an 
estimated 2 billion [currency unspecified]. It has allowed 
Venezuelan and Colombian industries to successfully market their 
products to other countries. Colombia is a country that has a 
very important industrial base. It has the most important 
thing--an infinite number of mini-industries or family 
industries. That constitutes a country's actual wealth. We have 
to follow that model with our handicrafts industry and with 
family-type industry in the production of goods that can be 
exported, something Venezuela has already been doing for the 
past few years. That will give us a true wealth. 
  [Fernandez] Now that you are broaching the economic topic, a 
month and a half ago spokesmen of various Colombian industries, 
banks, and small- and medium-size industries talked about trade 
relations between our two countries. They have many fears, and 
Colombian newspapers, EL TIEMPO, EL ESPECTADOR, and others, have 
great doubts and questions about our country's economic future. 
They, of course, link it to the trade relations that exist 
between our two nations. 
  [Burelli] Some journalists are very pessimistic about what 
is 
going to happen here. I have already met with some Colombian 
journalists who want to see a catastrophe in relations with 
Venezuela. It does not happen only with the Colombians. There is 
a succession of international spokesmen who are betting 
something terrible will happen here; that will not occur. 
Venezuela is in no worse shape than any other country of the 
world. In this marvelous, gigantic world of disorder in which we 
live Venezuela is not the worst of all countries. Look at 
Europe, Asia, and Africa, and you will find huge dramas. 
  [Fernandez] That should not be a consolation for us. 
  [Burelli] It should not be a consolation, but it should 
serve 
as an example. In other countries with less self-criticism than 
we have here, they are rebuilding their countries. It is each 
country's obligation to put its pieces back together after the 
collapse of the political empires dispersed them. 
  [Fernandez] Could these fears mentioned in the Colombian 
media, which pick up statements by business association and 
private sector spokesmen, be discussed in one way or the other 
within this open agenda for the 6 May meeting? 
  [Burelli] Spokesmen from all sectors will be coming here. We 
are going to invite all sectors of Venezuela to meet them, even 
though many of them already know each other. The relationship 
between Colombia and Venzuela is impressive. It is like a 
discovery. Venezuelans suddenly found out that Colombia is a 
very important country with which to do business and that they 
have to refine their capabilities of negotiation, because 
Colombians already have that capability. Colombians have 
discovered this is a country that has a great capability for 
consumption, where many of its products can be sold. If we, as a 
government, would like to interrupt this integration, we could 
not do it. Our integration has reached a desirable point. It has 
reached the private individual; it has reached a point where 
governments and politicians are practically no longer needed. 
  [Fernandez] Concerning those pessimists who insist on 
disrupting the possibility of an expansion of trade relations 
between the two countries, could they be successful? 
  [Burelli] Absolutely not. This trade relationship is no 
longer in the hands of any comptroller. Bankers, industrialists, 
businessmen, and technological experts are the ones who are 
dealing among themselves. When integration began the enemies of 
the politicians, the businessmen, thought we the politicians 
would ruin their domestic market. The businessmen are now doing 
all the work and have forgotten about the politicians; that is 
important for integration. 
  [Fernandez] That is a positive angle despite the ups and 
downs; there are conflictive situations, however. We have 
already talked about the river basins. On various occasions the 
Venezuelan Government and the Foreign Ministry have set clear 
guidelines on certain things. We do not know if Colombia has 
been reciprocal regarding these things. If we look at the other 
border problems we are going to find topics that I imagine will 
be discussed in depth. 
  [Burelli] Any problem between neighbors are the problems of 
two neighbors. I used to say we do not have any problem with 
Finland. As relations with Colombia intensify, our problems will 
intensify, but that is why the governments and the foreign 
ministries are there, to solve these kinds of problems. All 
ties, all associations, and all communities produce problems of 
friction and misunderstanding. 
  The Andean Integration Court will soon begin operations; it 
will settle cases. Businessmen need a court to which to go when 
there is a disagreement between them. The European Court, for 
example, has an impressive amount of work, because every time a 
businessman or an industrialist fails to honor a contract they 
resort to this court. We have the Andean Court in Quito, but it 
does little work, because we do not have the culture to resort 
to this court. The integration that we see as impressive with 
Colombia is beginning to occur between Colombia and Ecuador. The 
volume of trade will go from 300 million to 800 million 
[currency unspecified] between Colombia, which has 32 million 
people, and Ecuador, a much smaller country. Tomorrow it will be 
between Ecuador and Peru and then between Peru and Colombia. 
Little by little these things will be achieved. As integration 
intensifies there will be more cases to settle at the Andean 
Court. 
  [Fernandez] That is very important. Now, by contrast, those 
pessimistic voices, those that are maintaining extreme and 
radical positions in Colombia as well as those here in Venezuela 
are always trying to create differences between both countries. 
An example of this is a recent article by former Colombian 
Foreign Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds who cited a report by an 
EL TIEMPO correspondent here who had interviewed you, 
[Environment and Natural Renewable Resources] Minister Perez 
Lecuna, and [Special] Minister Pompeyo Marquez. Lemos Simmonds 
maintains radical and extreme positions toward Venezuela, and in 
the end he recommended what he seems to like: war, the 
possibility of a confrontation. 
  How does the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry view this kind of 
position, because Mr. Lemos Simmonds bears some weight in 
Colombia? 
  [Burelli] He served as foreign minister. 
  [Fernandez] Correct. 
  [Burelli] He is a good writer, but we view his statements 
naturally. These are the characteristics and freedoms of 
democracy. We view these things.... 
  [Fernandez, interrupting] Such statements are perhaps 
responsible for instigating Colombian military officers, much 
the same way some extremists brew ideas among Venezuelan 
officers. 
  [Burelli] We have had many Lemos Simmondses here, and we 
believe this is normal. We consider this kind of attitude an 
encouragement to our activity. They are not the ones, though, 
who impose their views. These gentlemen, given they no longer go 
to war, are calling for war. It is very easy to call for war 
when one does not have to go to war. 
  [Fernandez] Another important detail of these articles is 
the 
fact the nomination for OAS secretary general is addressed 
again. They suggest Venezuela will now assume a radical position 
or attitude, and President Caldera's government maintains a 
different position and it will be more belligerent; in sum, the 
trumpets of disaster are sounding once more. 
  [Burelli] You have seen our reaction. I will meet tomorrow 
with the Colombian foreign minister, with whom I traveled for 
six hours to Sao Paulo recently. About 12 generals of Colombia's 
general staff are coming to meet with an equal number of 
Venezuelan officers, including the defense minister, to define 
the agenda tomorrow. You have seen the preparations for the 
reception we will give President Gaviria here and how we have 
launched an offensive of friendship. This is what corresponds to 
countries with so many and important common interests. 
  [Fernandez] That is very important. A short while ago you 
said there were certain foreign interests abroad trying to sell 
a more complex and difficult image than the one we actually 
have. There was, at some point, talk of international campaigns 
against our country. I would like to hear your comments on this 
important topic, an ever present one, because comments and 
observations continue among Venezuelan public opinion. This has 
had some repercussions and has caused a reaction among people's 
opinion. What does the Foreign Ministry make of all these 
campaigns? Who is behind the campaigns? 
  [Burelli] Basically, there are economic interests behind 
these campaigns. Competition among certain Venezuelan products 
that are entering the markets of industrialized nations has 
generated a marked reaction from environmental agencies, 
violated human rights, when it is simply a matter of commercial 
competition. 
  In the United States, for instance, Citgo gas stations, many 
in number, have prompted the opposing reaction of others. They 
have claimed our gasoline needs to be reformulated, because it 
causes pollution, but it is not inferior to U.S. gasoline. This 
scheme is invented. Industrialized countries are trying to 
replace former protectionism, which must come down as a result 
of the universal implementation of GATT. They are simply 
inventing something new to close the doors on importation of 
other products. 
  [Fernandez] By the way, did Venezuela withdraw its suit 
before GATT on the gasoline issue? 
  [Burelli] It is still pending a resolution. [Words 
indistinct] do not think it will be necessary, because the 
United States has maintained an attitude of understanding in the 
last few days, but we could use this right. There are a series 
of arguments, such as the case of tuna and the case of 
Orimulsion [boiler fuel made from heavy oil] which caused [words 
indistinct] in Europe, where we finally made it. Our products 
had been denied access to the European Union, because we were 
not a drug-producing country and because we had a high per 
capita income. 
  In the Sao Paulo meeting last week, I had the pleasure of 
receiving from the EU the promise Venezuela will be included in 
the Andean tariff preference. This will open the European market 
for us. Indeed, we also obtained a 2-percent share of the EU's 
banana market. We are not yet a banana-producing country, and 
the collapse of Banco Latino had a negative impact on big banana 
crops in the southern Lake Maracaibo area with which we hoped to 
meet our quota, but we must now work to correct the situation. 
This will allow us to begin exporting and to take advantage of 
our market share, which we could lose if we fail to meet it. 
  [Fernandez] Now Dr. Burelli, some say there are Venezuelans 
abroad who have become spokespersons for these international 
campaigns. Some letters written by former ministers in the 
Carlos Andres Perez administration were published this weekend 
denying that possibility. Based on what the Venezuelan Foreign 
Ministry knows, is that assertion true? 
  [Burelli] Not really. There is the idea that some..... 
[pauses] I think they are as patriotic as you and I. 
  [Fernandez] But we hear everyday--perhaps you hear it more 
than I do--that many Venezuelans abroad like to speak ill of 
their country. That is very disappointing. In the specific cases 
of people who have held important positions, the Foreign 
Ministry is obligated to investigate this situation, but so far 
nothing has been done. 
  [Burelli] No, we know what is being said abroad about 
Venezuela. We receive reports from all our missions, and we have 
not heard of any former ministers speaking ill of our country. 
That is mere speculation. We don't think it is significant if a 
Venezuelan residing abroad, a Venezuelan without access to 
organizations or media sources, criticizes the country. 
  We have a bad image abroad largely because of what we 
project 
from here, from what is seen from here. 
  I have seen live Venezuelan television newscasts abroad in 
which 17 out of 17 news stories broadcast portrayed a bad image 
of Venezuela. These reports were on local issues that are of no 
interest abroad. Those who prepare the newscasts aired abroad 
must keep in mind that their audiences are not living in Caracas 
slums or in the countryside but in the world, where we are 
sending a discouraging message. 
  What good does it do for the Foreign Ministry and the 
Venezuelan Government to try to improve Venezuela's image abroad 
to bring investors by saying that this country now has legal 
security with clear rules if the television stations, with 
larger audiences.... 
  [Fernandez, interrupting] The image of a corrupt country is 
projected abroad. Indeed, there are reasons to sell the idea 
that this country has had corrupt governments in the past. 
  [Burelli] Well, that is something different. The daily 
insecurity is what is projected abroad. It is overstated as if 
there was nothing good in the country, and there are many 
positive things in the country. 
  [Fernandez] Certainly. Many television reporters only send 
the worst news abroad and convey the idea that we are crumbling. 
  [Burelli] Let's be frank. Our own television stations do not 
emphasize the message of our country's positive, noble aspects. 
  [Fernandez] Well, we cannot deny the truth. 
  [Burelli] But this kind of news reporting cannot continue 
indefinitely. 
  [Fernandez] Of course. We now have some viewer questions for 
Dr. Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas. One viewer from Los Naranjos 
asks: What is your opinion--this is another matter, but it is 
important to address anyway--of the personnel working at the 
Foreign Ministry, who, according to your statements to the 
media, seem to be underqualified? 
  [Burelli] The problem is that there are too many employees, 
among whom there are some good employees. I am trying to 
identify those who are inefficient so I can get rid of them. 
  [Fernandez] We have another call. Our numbers are 793-1845 
and 793-1634. When will the Foreign Ministry help raise the 
self-esteem of Venezuelans? 
  [Burelli] The Foreign Ministry is working to raise the 
self-esteem of Venezuelans, not just now but always. Our 
diplomats have done their share in an unassuming way, and their 
task has been made more complex by the preconceived notion that 
the Foreign Ministry is useless. I have said before that the 
important causes Venezuela has lost were not lost because of the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  [Fernandez] From Valle Abajo--this is a question that would 
have to be answered by other authorities, not the Foreign 
Ministry--a viewer asks: The Peruvian Consulate has not 
delivered passports for the last four months. Could you take 
some action? Can you speak to the Peruvian consul in this 
country? 
  [Burelli] That is not my responsibility. 
  [Fernandez] From Valencia, a viewer asks: When will a 
selective policy of immigration be implemented in Venezuela? 
  [Burelli] It is currently under way. Commissioner (Jans 
Norman) is in Asia right now setting quotas for the number of 
emigrants we can receive. He is working so all state governors 
can offer facilities to install selected groups of emigrants and 
their families in the interior. 
  [Fernandez] [Words indistinct] what we Venezuelans need are 
foreign ministers who do not allow the constant theft of our 
land. 
  [Burelli] No foreign minister allows it; no Foreign Ministry 
has allowed it. The Foreign Ministry won the Orinoco River for 
Venezuela in 1833 with 300,000 km east, or rather west of the 
Orinoco River with half of Guajira. Congress refused to ratify 
the treaty just to prevent Santos Michelena, who was the noble 
negotiator, from becoming president based that success. That was 
when we first began to lose Venezuelan territory. We have to 
know history. 
  [Fernandez] The political ineptness of the last century is 
responsible for the controversy in which we are immersed with 
Colombia. The last question has to do with the Curacao Branch of 
Banco Latino. Legislators Walter Marquez and William Davila 
Barrios were here yesterday and urged the Foreign Ministry to 
intervene because this is a state to state problem. 
  [Burelli] I am very fond of Walter Marquez, and his actions 
have our full support. He knows it. His is a very noble, 
selfless task with a great spirit. We must look at the matter, 
however, with a cooler head. We have followed all the steps. The 
Netherlands has its laws; banks are autonomous in Curacao. We 
must always keep in mind that the Netherlands is the second 
largest investor in Venezuela after the United States. It is the 
only country that never lost faith in our capabilities. We are 
following the procedures as they should be followed. We told the 
Curacao Central Bank president that he can hold a news 
conference at Foreign Ministry to explain how Banco Latino works 
in Curacao, the operations it has conducted, and the measures to 
be taken. 
  [Fernandez] Tomorrow's guest on this program will be the 
president of the Central Bank of the Netherlands Antilles. 
  [Burelli] That is great. I think that is great. 
  [Fernandez] He is coming from Curacao. Depositors have 
complained of the humiliation they suffered in Curacao. 
Lawmakers said they were not treated well. We will discuss all 
those things. At some point there was mistrust, or some said 
there was an armed operation around the assembly. 
  [Burelli] I watched that program yesterday morning, and I 
asked the consul in Curacao to file a report. As a matter of 
fact, I found this to be rather odd and worrisome. 
  [Fernandez] Will the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry intervene 
in 
this case? 
  [Burelli] It will intervene by asking our authorities to 
inform us of all the investigations that legislators like 
Marquez and Davila Barrios are conducting. From a legal 
standpoint, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry intervenes when a 
body, a court, or the entity with jurisdiction officially asks 
us to act. We cannot step in except for providing logistical 
support or the assistance of our consul and ambassador to 
conduct an investigation and expedite all the necessary 
proceedings. Legally, we cannot act and order an extradition or 
file a request before a foreign court unless we are asked to do 
so by the Venezuelan legal system. 
  [Fernandez] We thank Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli 
Rivas for being with us on "24 Hours" and you for your telephone 
calls.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Apr (NA) -- UCR [Radical Civic 
Union] President Raul Alfonsin was elected on 29 April as 
president of the UCR bloc in the Constituent Assembly and 
Cordoba UCR leader Ramon Mestre was appointed first vice 
presidential candidate for the Constituent Assembly that will 
meet in the cities of Santa Fe and Parana. 
  Both decisions were made during the first 10 minutes of a 
meeting the UCR Constituent Assembly members are holding at the 
party's National Committee headquarters in Buenos Aires' 
Congreso neighborhood. 
  The motion for Alfonsin to preside over the UCR bloc was 
made 
by Antonio Hernandez, a pro-[Cordoba Governor Eduardo] Angeloz 
Constituent Assembly member from Cordoba, while Cesar 
Jaroslavsky, a pro-Alfonsin member from Buenos Aires, moved that 
Mestre be nominated first vice president of the Constituent 
Assembly.

  [Text] San Carlos de Bariloche (Argentina), 28 Apr (EFE) -- 
At its meeting today, the Indigenous Communities Advisory 
Council [Consejo Asesor Indigena] (CAI) assembly warned that 
4,000 Mapuche Indian families in southern Argentina are barely 
able to eke out an existence. 
  The meeting was attended by indigenous people from the Rio 
Negro and Neuquen Provinces in the Argentine Patagonian region. 
  The CAI issued a press release stating that "the prices of 
products have not changed," adding that -- on the contrary -- 
"low prices continue to aggravate the situation of small- and 
medium-size producers." 
  The CAI demands that the authorities order the immediate 
implementation of a comprehensive Indian law and rejects 
"attempts to divide the region, which merely seek to undermine 
the historic decision by indigenous peoples to remain 
politically united." 
  The CAI reaffirms the determination to struggle and resist 
all plans "to evict us and to do everything possible to defend 
the land that is our life." 
  They decided to strengthen the political unification of the 
southern region "through coordinated movements, as a way to 
defend our rights and the rights of all groups affected by 
current economic policies." 
  They demand the implementation of the Southern Region 
Development Organization "which must make every effort to plan 
alternatives." 
  The document concludes: "The participation of the CAI in the 
continental, indigenous, black, and popular movement places us 
on the same footing as other Argentine and Latin American 
organizations, on the same path of construction, and as part of 
the same resistance."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 27 Apr (EFE) -- Manuel Mondino, 
president of the National Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA), 
has said that Argentina wants to consolidate its position as a 
nuclear technology exporting country, adding that the agency 
exported for a total of $300 million between 1977 and 1993. 
  Mondino told EFE: "Over the past two decades the country has 
won a place in the competitive international market, thanks to 
the quality of its exports and the degree of technology 
transfer." 
  The CNEA is a state organization, associated with private 
capital to design and develop projects and conduct research in 
the areas of nuclear power plants, fuel cycles, radioisotopes, 
radiation, and technology services. 
  Argentina has signed several agreements for the peaceful use 
of nuclear energy, and is a member of various safeguard 
agreements. Nuclear agency representatives exhibited the results 
of their latest research efforts during a recent American 
continent experts' meeting in southern Argentina. 
  "On that occasion we explained that the CNEA provided 16 
percent of the electricity consumed by the country through its 
two nuclear plants, which places us in first place as an energy 
producer," Mondino said. 
  The CNEA president said that on the occasion there were also 
lectures on the application of radioisotopes, which is a vital 
product for the early diagnosis of several diseases, in nuclear 
medicine. 
  In the area of exports, the most important deals were the 
export of reactors to Peru, Algeria, and Egypt, the sale of 
uranium dioxide to Germany, and a plant for the production of 
radio-medicines to Cuba. The CNEA also closed deals with 
Canada, Iran, Rumania, and Turkey. 
  Argentina produces 8 percent of the total world cobalt 60 
production. Cobalt 60 is used in nuclear medicine, the 
preservation of food, the elimination of pests that attack crops 
and livestock, and to improve industrial yields. The 
radioactive material is produced in the Embalse Nuclear Plant, 
and the surplus is exported to the United States, France, Chile, 
Colombia, Mexico, and Belgium, Manuel Mondino said. 
  Regarding Argentina's development of nuclear projects for 
peaceful use, as compared with the rest of Latin America, 
Mondino said that his country and Brazil "have the most advanced 
projects, closely followed by Mexico." 
  Mondino expressed enthusiasm for the plant to irradiate 
waste 
that is being developed by CNEA scientists, stressing that Chile 
has shown interest in the project because it is redesigning its 
own sewage disposal network. 
  The CNEA has 5,682 agents throughout the country. Among its 
most important installations are two operating nuclear plants, 
one nuclear plant in an advanced state of construction, three 
atomic centers, one reactor for the production of radioisotopes, 
and one plant for food irradiation. 
  The agency also has a cell for the production of sealed 
cobalt 60 sources, two heavy water plants -- one experimental 
and one industrial -- one uranium enrichment plant, one Nuclear 
Medicine School, and one Physics and Nuclear Energy Institute, 
which is considered one of the most important in Latin America.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 29 Apr (NA) -- A 23-year-old man 
had the lower third of his right arm and the forefinger of his 
left hand amputated today, after an explosive device, which he 
found tied to a sign of the People's Revolutionary Organization 
(ORP) at the intersection of General Paz Avenue and Francisco 
Beiro Street, went off. 
  Edgardo Dario Ruiz was strolling with a group of friends at 
0300 this morning when he saw a strange package hanging from the 
sign. He took the package to a private residence at the 
intersection of Ejercito de los Andes and San Roque Streets in 
Jose Ingenieros district, and tried to open it, at which point 
the device went off. 
  The young man was immediately taken to Santojanni Hospital 
where the lower third of his right arm and the forefinger of his 
left hand had to be amputated. 
  Leonardo Vicente, 18, Ariel Leroiani, 18, and a female aged 
14 were accompanying Ruiz, who also sustained first-degree burns 
to his right eye. 
  Vicente's face was also bruised by the explosion He was 
taken 
to Santojanni Hospital as well, but his injuries are not serious. 
  According to the Buenos Aires police the homemade bomb 
exploded as it was being manipulated. They also reported that 
four other explosive devices were found attached to the sign, 
three of them 2.54 cm wide by 15 cm long, and the last one 1.27 
cm wide by 20 cm long. The bomb squad buried and detonated them. 
  The sign to which the bombs were attached said "Let's fight 
the labor reform," was signed by the ORP, and bore the red 
communist star. 
  Shortly after the bomb exploded, Interior Minister Carlos 
Ruckauf said that it was a "serious matter" although he added 
that "these kinds of booby traps are nothing new." 
  Speaking to Radio Continental, the interior minister said: 
"During these 10 years of democracy we have had this very same 
organization (meaning the ORP) cropping up every so often and 
setting these booby traps." [passage omitted]

Carlos Alvarez and Alfredo Bravo: "Those to the Left of the 
Government"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Responding to those who criticize them for evading 
economic issues, Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez, Alfredo Bravo, Anibal 
Ibarra, and Norberto Laporta spoke with LA PRENSA about 
privatizations, competition, deregulation, economic 
liberalization, and the Cavallo Plan. 
  In his now classic column in LA PRENSA, Javier Gonzalez 
Fraga 
stated last Sunday that the future opposition to capitalism 
would no longer renounce its economic principles, but would try 
to criticize it from the inside, in effect acknowledging its 
economic success. 
  The alternative presented by the Argentine left, on the 
other 
hand, was based on a virtual replacement of private activity by 
the state, although it maintained the notion of private 
property. The choice was clear: capitalism or socialism. 
  The economy would function on the basis, not of the free 
market, but state planning. Terms such as privatization, 
deregulation, liberalization, strong currency, and competition 
were not in the left's vocabulary. 
  On the international level, they identified with the 
democratic socialist movements that were implementing planning 
policies. The Weimar Republic in Germany, the first 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico, which 
reformed its country's constitution, the postwar British Labour 
Party, and Salvador Allende's government in Chile could be 
considered valid points of reference. 
  At present, the state vs. market debate appears to be 
dominated by capitalism, insofar as it has recovered 
academically and has triumphed in the sphere of economic policy. 
Governments are no longer advocating more state and less market, 
but instead are trying to expand the market. And the governments 
labeled socialist are also participating in this era, applying 
capitalist models. 
  The question, then, is this: Where do leftists in our 
country 
fit into all these changes? 
<H5>  Inside and Outside </H5>
  In theory, it could be said that there are two successful 
political movements of the left (and the elections this Sunday 
will serve as a measure of how representative they are): the 
Grand Front (FG) and Socialist Unity. 
  Their economic proposals are marked by criticism of the 
capitalism of President Carlos Menem's government. Both maintain 
that the Cavallo Plan does not have social measures to protect 
the most defenseless segments of society. "It is for the benefit 
of a few," agree Alfredo Bravo and Carlos Alvarez. 
  When asked by LA PRENSA if there are indeed fresh winds 
blowing in the left and if Felipe Gonzalez is an example of 
that, the first convention candidates almost agree. 
  "Each situation must be considered separately," says Bravo. 
"Spain is not the same as Argentina. It is impossible to imagine 
Spain outside of the European Community, so Gonzalez has been 
forced to accept some economic freedoms that I would not 
accept." "Chacho" Alvarez, on the other hand, contends that 
"although the countries' circumstances are different, I should 
point out that Felipe Gonzalez's social democracy has failed to 
achieve a society without poverty." 
  A comparative analysis reveals that the Grand Front's 
economic proposal differs from that announced by Socialist 
Unity. The latter's representatives stated at the outset of our 
dialogue that if they were in power, they would review all 
privatizations, and they would not under any circumstances 
accept the current market economy. The Grand Front is not so 
radical: "We have not yet defined an alternative economic 
program," says "Chacho" Alvarez, "however, we believe that 
stability is one of the government's great achievements. If we 
were called upon to run the government, we would maintain it. We 
also think that economic activity should be assigned a very 
significant role in the economy. We favor economic policies that 
view the market as a complement to the state. For example, in 
the case of the economic liberalization, Argentina should gain 
competitiveness to export more goods." 
  Each of them appears to have different cricitisms. While the 
socialists under Bravo's leadership criticize capitalism from 
the outside, the Grand Front prefers to do so from the inside. 
  In this regard, there is one fact that "Chacho" Alvarez may 
perhaps have realized, and that is that to win elections, it is 
necessary to move toward the center, and especially toward what 
society thinks. Today, Argentine society is imbued with the 
ideas of economic stability based on price freedom. 
  In short, neither of the two lefts will defend free-market 
economics, and both advocate policies for employment, housing, 
business-labor-government coordination, nationalizations, and 
market control, plus broad social policies aimed at promoting 
the most backward sectors. 
  They differ, however, on how much state intervention there 
should be. This proves that the triumph of capitalism has left 
different impressions on the Argentine left, and that its 
leaders have not reacted in the same ways. 
<H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>
<H5>  Anibal Ibarra: "The State Is Not a Corporation" </H5>
  Grand Front Councilman Anibal Ibarra believes that his party 
is in the center-left. "We do not identify with any 
international model, however," he told LA PRENSA. 
  "In general, we aspire to achieve monetary stability, but 
with a state presence in the economy, complemented by the 
private sector," the councilman concluded. 
  With respect to the privatizations, Ibarra favors them, but 
with limitations: "We want to privatize only those areas that 
are not so economically and strategically important that they 
affect the control of the national government." When asked what 
those sectors might be, he responded that hydrocarbons, 
telecommunications, and air traffic should not be privatized. 
  He also maintains that the state cannot be run as if it were 
a big company that must yield profits. "The state is not a 
corporation that is merely interested in the bottom line. There 
are social gains that cannot be assigned monetary value." 
  "If we were in office, we would administer public resources 
by spending money on clothing for children rather than compact 
discs," concluded Anibal Ibarra cheerfully. 
<H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>
<H5>  Norberto Laporta: "Stop the Neoliberal Advance" </H5>
  "There is a new left that must try to stop the neoliberal 
advance. Our thinking is in accord with the position of Michel 
Rocard in France, who contends that although socialism has 
changed, it should not borrow principles from neoliberalism." 
This was the opening salvo in LA PRENSA's dialogue with Norberto 
Laporta, Buenos Aires city councilman for Socialist Unity. 
  As for the national situation, the second convention 
candidate of that same party argues that the privatization 
process was handled wrong. "The government sold the state for a 
song," explains Laporta. 
  The councilman also outlined his position on social issues: 
"The government's neoliberalism amounts to the repeal of the 
workers' conquests, given that capital-labor relations continue 
to be exploitative. The current government's capitalism is 
Manchesterian in nature." 
  Laporta believes there are three economic spheres: public, 
private, and mixed. "The public sector includes strategic 
economic activities such as public services, petroleum, and the 
airlines. In the mixed sector there are initiatives that are 
important for the economy, but they are not of the caliber of 
the first group. And finally, the strictly private sphere 
encompasses the rest of the economy," explained Laporta. 
<H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>
<H5>  Carlos Alvarez: "The Stability Is Undeniable" </H5>
  The creator of the Grand Front says that after the elections 
(today), he will get to work on an economic program for 
governing, first the federal capital, and then the country. 
  Speaking about the economy for the first time, Alvarez 
outlined his party's future economic proposal: "We are going to 
maintain stability, although we will add social measures to it; 
we will not reverse the privatizations, and the opening up of 
trade will be accompanied by a policy of complementarity between 
the state and the market." 
  [Bruno] How do you define the Grand Front? 
  [Alvarez] The Grand Front occupies the center-left portion 
of 
the political spectrum. I define it as an open political 
alternative that is recovering values currently being lost in 
Argentina. 
  I do not know if proposing the modernization of the economy 
with the inclusion of social programs means being to the left of 
the government. We do indeed contend that Argentina needs to be 
more equitable and more balanced. 
  [Bruno] Do you identify with any socialist movement in 
Europe? 
  [Alvarez] I think there is a crisis of paradigms. Marxism 
has 
failed. The authoritarian socialisms collapsed. Social democracy 
has failed to achieve more equitable societies, and there is 
also a failure of the idea of market fundamentalism, the 
corollary of which is the rise of racism and xenophobia. 
  Our challenge is to construct a new paradigm, and there is 
no 
reason why it should resemble any of the options that are 
dominating the international scene. 
  [Bruno] If you were in charge of the public administration, 
what model would you promote? 
  [Alvarez] In principle, it is difficult for us to place 
ourselves in different situations. Today we are expressing 
Argentine society's demand for a political force that can be 
effective when it comes time to control the excesses and abuses 
of power. 
  I should point out, however, that we must draw up an 
alternative economic program for after the constitutional 
convention elections. 
  Our growth is based on gradualism. First we must 
institutionalize the political strength of the Grand Front. 
  [Bruno] In that connection, what truth is there to the 
rumors 
that you are working on a minicabinet for an eventual mayoral 
candidacy? 
  [Alvarez] I am not married to any candidacy. I do want to be 
a part of a political movement that will provide an alternative 
for government. In that regard, we have been up front with the 
socialists, proposing that they head the list in these elections. 
  We are going to work on the issues that are important to the 
city, however, because people will not vote for us to govern the 
country if we cannot first show that we can run a local 
government efficiently. 
  [Bruno] But they will not vote for you to run the city, 
either, unless you tell them what you are going to do ahead of 
time.... 
  [Alvarez] That is right. We must present a clear alternative 
for administration and government, and at the same time prove 
that corruption is not a matter of a few scattered officials 
lining their pockets fortuitously. Corruption is systemic, 
structural, and it is affecting services that are essential for 
improving our quality of life. For example, the most pessimistic 
estimates peg this dirty money at $4 billion a year. 
  [Bruno] One indication of the Grand Front's economic policy 
is its assertions that stability is an accomplishment that it 
intends to maintain. 
  [Alvarez] It would be crass of us to deny that there is 
stability. Nevertheless, we believe that although the stability 
is an incontrovertible fact that is beneficial for society, we 
must bring to the fore the issues that it cannot resolve by 
itself. 
  [Bruno] Do you believe in privatization? 
  [Alvarez] I believe that we must look at each privatization 
individually. It is an instrument that we cannot ignore. 
  I think that there is no Cavallo model. There are 
instruments. So we will analyze each instrument, one by one. 
With regard to the privatization instrument, we have no 
ideological prejudices that cause us to oppose it. 
  But we still must analyze each privatization, one by one. 
For 
example, we believe that the privatization of the airline was 
very badly handled, because we ended up with a single flag 
airline in foreign hands. We know, however, that we will not 
have a chance to review it, although we would like to discuss 
its efficiency, the quality of service, and the rate structure. 
  In short, we agree with the way some of the privatizations 
were carried out and not with others. 
  We also do not think it prehistoric to question whether the 
state could have run a profitable company effectively, as is the 
case in other countries in the world. 
  [Bruno] What about the economic liberalization? 
  [Alvarez] The external liberalization is aimed at improving 
the competitiveness of the Argentine economy. We can propose 
another liberalization model that looks at how the most advanced 
countries in the world set up industries so that they can be 
competitive and gain a market position that they do not now 
have. The idea is to find an economic design with complementary 
roles for the state and the private sectors, in which the state 
provides orientation and infrastructure and seeks out 
competitive niches. 
  If we leave everything up to the spontaneous development of 
the market, Argentina may end up without any production of 
high-value-added goods. I do not see anything wrong with the 
state helping private industry. 
  [Bruno] Could the government of Patricio Aylwin be a 
reflection of your policies? 
  [Alvarez] The Chilean model was phased in gradually. First 
they achieved economic efficiency, although with a much less 
dogmatic vision. For example, they have the Chile Foundation, 
which helps small and medium-sized companies become competitive 
in the world. 
  But I think there was also some neglect of the sectors that 
remained on the sidelines, excluded from the ideological 
reconversion. 
  In this regard, it seems to me that Argentina would not have 
to wait for a new government to become aware of this situation.

<H5>  Alfredo Bravo: "We Would Review all Privatizations" </H5>
  In a tone sharply critical of the government's economic 
policy, Deputy Alfredo Bravo of Socialist Unity told LA PRENSA 
that this plan ignores the individual. "It takes into account 
only concepts like efficiency, surpluses, and competition." 
  When asked about the socialist movement in the world, and 
specifically about Felipe Gonzalez's economic policy, the deputy 
responded that socialism has not changed. "To determine whether 
there have been political mutations, we must place ourselves in 
the situation of each country. For example, Felipe Gonzalez was 
forced to introduce economic freedoms in Spain that I would not 
accept. But he had to do it, since it was a prerequisite for 
joining the European Economic Community." 
  [Bruno] How would you sum up the socialist program? 
  [Bravo] First of all, we believe that the dogmatic part of 
the Constitution should be amended. We advocate the recognition 
of the rights of workers, children, women, and the elderly. In 
the educational sphere, our program calls for free education as 
a constitutional right. 
  If the spirit of the Constitution of 1853 was liberal and 
that of the Reform of 1949 was social, the spirit of our program 
is socialist. On the worker's side. 
  Furthermore, it is obvious that there are some concepts that 
were impossible to get through in 1853, such as democracy and 
social rights. 
  Our reform program is to the left of the government and of 
the Radical Civic Union (UCR). We socialists have always 
occupied that position on the political and economic spectrum in 
Argentina. 
  [Bruno] Is there a new concept of socialism in the world? 
  [Bravo] It is not that socialism has changed, but it has 
adapted to the specific situations present in each country. The 
circumstances of Felipe Gonzalez's government in Spain are 
different from those of the socialist movements in Latin 
America. It is impossible to imagine Spain outside of the 
European Community. And joining the European Community has 
necessitated the acceptance of economic freedoms that I would 
never accept. 
  [Bruno] Where do you stand on the old "state vs. market" 
debate? 
  [Bravo] I think that the state should regulate the economy. 
In an effort to give priority to social issues, I think it is 
necessary for it to intervene in economic activity by monitoring 
private companies and promoting worker participation. I favor 
direct productive activity by the state. 
  [Bruno] What is your opinion of the Cavallo Plan? 
  [Bravo] The Cavallo Plan is devoid of social content. We 
think it is a program that considers only efficiency, surpluses, 
and competition, and ignores the most important issue, the 
individual. 
  If we were in power, we would carry out social measures, and 
we would review all privatizations. 
  The roots of the socialist movement are Marxist. 
Nevertheless, this does not mean that we would adopt all the 
precepts of Marxism, or that we are Marxists. For example, it 
was Alfredo Palacios who did the Spanish translation of "Das 
Kapital" that was used to train many socialist leaders.

Ramirez] 
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas--The Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) emerged as an armed group in the early 
1980's under the slogan "Live for the homeland or die for 
freedom." 
  The Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) had been 
formed previously; they were one of the organizations that 
spread the urban and rural guerrilla fighting into several 
states in the 1970's. When the FALN disappeared, their members 
in Chiapas crossed out the A, leaving the organization's name as 
the Forces of National Liberation (FLN). 
  From it emerged the present-day EZLN, which on 1 January, 
coinciding with the enactment of the Free Trade Agreement, 
cried: "Enough!" And on behalf of those who "have nothing, 
absolutely nothing," it proceeded to take over several Chiapas 
towns, weapons in hand. 
  The current conflict in Chiapas has its most remote 
antecedent in the "Fray Bartolome de las Casas" First Indian 
Congress, which was held in San Cristobal from 13 to 15 October 
1974. 
  The date was fitting. It was the 500th anniversary of Fray 
Bartolome de las Casas's birth. State authorities asked Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz to cooperate with them; he agreed, on the condition 
that it be a true Indian congress, not a quaint tourist event, 
much less one with overtones of demagoguery. His condition was 
accepted. 
  So the Indians spoke: 
  "It is time that we start thinking about whether we really 
have the freedom that Fray Bartolome de las Casas left behind, 
because all of us, the Tzotziles, the Tzeltales, the Choles, and 
the Tojolabales, live in the highlands while all of the ladinos 
live in the city and have nice ranches and estates. 
  "But when we demand our rights or want to ask for our lands, 
we cannot. They already took our former organization away from 
us. This is why now they even impose our authorities and even 
the federal ones on us. This is also why there are abuses by the 
estate owners. Like in Altamirano, where the soldiers burned 
down our homes, just because we asked for land. 
  "Who is going to defend us? We are going to defend ourselves 
by organizing everyone. Because in unity there is strength." 
  Juan Ortiz, a Mame Indian from Guatemala, said on behalf of 
his Indian brothers: 
  "There is a lot of oppression. We are never going to be 
respected unless we unite. All of Latin America is interested in 
uniting now. 
  "We Indians were never consulted when the borders were 
drawn. 
We Mame Indians are one example. Our race is split in two: Mames 
in Guatemala, Mames in the Soconusco in Chiapas. 
  "Let's talk and let's walk together." 
  And they kept on talking about the poverty and misery in 
which the Choles live in their hovels on the estates, owing to 
the working arrangements imposed on them, the starvation wages, 
the hacienda stores, the lack of medicine, the alcoholism, and 
the business interests. 
  "We work from sunup to sundown for less than seven pesos a 
day. Children have to start working at age 10 at wages of one to 
two pesos a day. These wages are paid in vouchers or merchandise 
or drinks, not in cash. You have to work for free on Sunday 
under the system they call `la pagina' [the page]. And then 
there is the droit de seigneur, when our wives and daughters get 
raped. At coffee harvest time the women and children have to 
work just like the men." 
  In olden days the Indians had communal ownership of the land 
on which they lived, as stated in the documents in their 
possession. 
  "We have been trying to legalize our lands since 1935 and 
have not been able to get the documentation up to date so far. 
The engineers, who charge a lot of money, never hand in the 
complete report, either because they do not finish their 
measurements or because they get fed up with the commune or 
ejido members. There is a lot of corruption among the agrarian 
authorities." 
  There are no health centers or medicines. As a result the 
Indians suffer from diseases "and we do not know where they come 
from, whether it's the water, the food, or the housing. The 
reason is malnutrition and poverty, because our living 
conditions are conditions of disease and death." 
  Grievance movements emerged among the Indian groups after 
the 
congress. The "Ach Quiptic ta Lecubtesel" Union of Ejidos was 
created on 12 December 1975 in the Ocosingo Forest. The "Land 
and Freedom" Union of Ejidos emerged in 1976 in the Comitan 
area, which includes part of the Lacandon Forest. And on 14 
August 1978 the "Peasant Struggle" Union of Ejidos was born. 
  Other independent groups were formed in the northern part of 
the state starting in 1974; they later linked up with the 
Proletarian Line (LP) movement. 
  In the highlands region the peasants from Villa de las Rosas 
and Teopisca pursued the struggle to regain their lands most 
intensely, as did the Indians from San Juan Chamula, Larrainzar, 
and Tenejapa. 
  The Peasant Bloc of the State of Chiapas (Blocech) was 
organized in the Soconusco zone in 1979. 
  Agrarian movements also arose along the coast. There was a 
vigorous peasant movement that took isolated action in Tonala, 
Arriaga, and Pijijiapan. 
  In the case of the peasants from Villaflores, Chiapa de 
Corzo, and Flores Magon, the struggle revolved around demands to 
extend the ejido areas and, in a few cases, funding for or the 
establishment of new population centers. 
  Other movements had not waited for the congress. This was 
the 
case with the community of Venustiano Carranza in the Central 
Valleys, which had been fighting to regain its communal lands 
since the 1930's, and with the 10 April Peasant Alliance in the 
Fraylesca. 
  Neither the Mexican Communist Party (PCM) nor the Socialist 
Workers Party (PST) were involved back then. Nor were mass 
organizations like the Independent Federation of Agricultural 
Workers and Peasants (CIOAC) or the Emiliano Zapata Peasant 
Organization (OCEZ) or the Union of Ejido Unions and Peasant 
Groups in Solidarity of Chiapas, all of which emerged more 
strongly in the late 1970's. 
  In 1974, President Luis Echeverria decreed that 614,000 
hectares of the Lacandon Forest would remain the possession of 
just 67 Lacandon Indians, even though more than 20,000 peasants 
who had been brought in from all over the country were already 
settled in the surrounding area and were asking for plots of 
land. Eventually, the peasants charge, the lands remained in the 
hands of the latifundio [great estate] holders and officials of 
Nacional Financiera (NAFIN) [National Finance Bank], who got 
rich by exploiting the fancy woods, thus further intensifying 
discontent in the region. 
  A group of leftist militants that emerged as part of the 
1968 
Student Movement also arrived in the Chiapas jungle in the early 
1970's, seeking to identify with the problems of the peasants 
under the pro-Maoist "mass line." 
  In 1974 the Federal Government destroyed a guerrilla 
encampment in the Lacandon Forest. It was a training camp that 
the FALN had been operating on "El Diamante" estate in the 
municipality of Ocosingo. The FALN were led by Cesar German 
Yanez Munoz, "Pedro." 
  Weapons and subversive propaganda were seized, and an 
undetermined number of members of the organization were 
arrested. They were displayed publicly by the then attorney 
general of the republic, Pedro Ojeda Paullada. 
  The Emiliano Zapata Revolutionary Brigade, which was part of 
the 23 September Communist League, then came to Chiapas. It was 
under the command of Luis Miguel Corral Garcia and Manuel 
Amarilla Palafox, who were killed in Mexico City in 1977. 
  The Guiding Ideological Organization (OID) officially 
arrived 
in the state in late 1977 and early 1978. Also showing up were 
the militants from the Union of the People, which later became 
the Clandestine Revolutionary Workers Party-Union of the People 
(PROCUP); after 25 years of armed struggle this group linked up 
ideologically with the Party of the Poor (PDLP), which Lucio 
Cabanas had founded in the state of Guerrero. 
  These groups pursued their policy of the "Prolonged People's 
War," based on Marxist-Leninist fundamentals, "to achieve 
political power and emancipate the people from the bourgeoisie 
and U.S. imperialism." 
  In 1982 PROCUP took up the legacy of the Union of the 
People, 
an armed group founded by Jose Maria Ortiz Vides of Guatemala. 
That year it reassessed its short-, medium-, and long-term goals 
for the takeover of power by the proletariat. 
  For five years as the Union of the People, its activists 
conducted "expropriations" (bank holdups) and planted bombs in 
shopping centers, banks, and government offices along with other 
armed militant groups. 
  The Armed Forces of National Liberation were exterminated in 
Chiapas. Years later, other natives of Chiapas rebuilt the 
political-military organization, removing the A from its 
initials. As of the early 1980's they called themselves the 
Forces of National Liberation (FLN) and set up their armed wing: 
the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). 
  The EZLN has a broad social base. According to ranchers in 
Ocosingo and Altamirano, its visible face is the Emiliano Zapata 
National Independent Peasant Alliance (ANCIEZ). 
  ANCIEZ started in late 1989, when it was called the Emiliano 
Zapata Independent Peasant Alliance (ACIEZ). It was local back 
then, with a presence in Altamirano, Sabanilla, Salto de Agua, 
Ocosingo, and San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  It set itself up as ANCIEZ two years later, taking in 
Indians 
and peasants from the municipalities of El Bosque, Larrainzar, 
Chenalho, Ocosingo, Chanal, Oxchuc, Huixtan, Salto de Agua, 
Tila, Tumbala, Sabanilla, and San Cristobal de las Casas. It was 
officially established in the Puebla highlands, where peasant 
delegates from the states of Chihuahua, Veracruz, Oaxaca, 
Chiapas, and Puebla met. The next year, 1992, peasants from 
Coahuila, Guerrero, and San Luis Potosi joined the organization. 
  They demonstrated their ability to call up and rally their 
members on 12 October 1992 in Chiapas to commemorate 500 years 
of Indian, Black, and Grassroots Resistance. Some 10,000 Indians 
marched in San Cristobal de las Casas, half of them from ANCIEZ. 
They could be distinguished from the rest because their columns 
had a military look and were carrying bows and arrows. 
  They toppled the statue of Diego de Mazariegos, the 
conqueror 
and founder of San Cristobal de las Casas. Mayor Jorge Mario 
Lescieur Talavera accused the Dominican friars of what he called 
"acts of vandalism." 
  Seventeen other organizations that on 11 October 1992 had 
formed the Front of Social Organizations of Chiapas (FOSCH) 
marched along with ANCIEZ. The most representative were CIOAC, 
OCEZ, and the Council of Indian Representatives of the Chiapas 
Highlands (CRIACH). 
  During the days prior to the Indian march, a rumor was going 
around the forest and highlands of Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las 
Margaritas that the guerrillas were going to take over the 
municipal capitals and loot shops. 
  ANCIEZ disappeared officially from Chiapas in February 1993 
after an assembly in Sabanilla. All of its leaders left San 
Cristobal de las Casas during the first three months of the 
year. No one knows where they went. The last time that they 
appeared as an organization was during a FOSCH march in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez on 22 and 23 April of last year. The EZLN kept up its 
political, ideological, and military training, however. 
  The first public news of the guerrillas' existence came 
after 
the charred bodies of two military personnel were found in San 
Isidro El Ocotal on 20 March 1993. Then came the shoot-outs in 
the Corralchen highlands, between Ocosingo and Altamirano, on 
22, 23, and 24 May. Two soldiers were reported dead and two 
others wounded. A civilian, who it is now known belonged to the 
EZLN, also died. 
  In March and April 1993, issue 61 of the newspaper 
PROLETARIO, which is published by PROCUP-PDLP and distributed 
clandestinely in several states around the country, said that 
"the existence of the revolutionary movement in the state 
(Chiapas) is an open secret that is being heard and spread all 
over. The people are helping it, sympathizing with, aiding, and 
protecting the guerrillas." 
  It commented on the appointment of Governor Patrocinio 
Gonzalez Blanco as interior secretary: 
  "There were countless human rights violations in Chiapas 
during his term of office: assassinations of peasant and Indian 
leaders in agrarian conflicts; merciless evictions of entire 
communities struggling for land; quasi-fascist reforms of the 
Penal Code; jails full of peasants, Indians, and social 
fighters; harassment of newsmen for exercising their freedom of 
expression, to the point of murder in some instances; serial 
killings of homosexuals, suggesting the existence of "death 
squads" linked to police chiefs in the state; a rise in drug 
trafficking throughout the state; persecution and jailing of 
clergy committed to the suffering people and Indians; cacique 
and cattle-ranching groups that encourage paramilitary forces to 
kill grass-roots leaders, attack peasants and Indians, and 
kidnap and assault citizens. 
  "These are Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido's credentials, and 
his 
appointment to head the secretariat in charge of internal 
politics is symptomatic. As far as the people of Chiapas are 
concerned, Gonzalez Garrido remains a latent threat, all the 
more so since his successor enjoys his complete confidence and 
is committed to the same shady, retrograde, cacique interests: 
Elmar Setzer Marseille." 
  Although there were no political grievances at all, there is 
evidence that the wave of kidnappings gripping Chiapas is linked 
to the guerrillas. 
  At least 20 persons have been kidnapped over the past two 
years, and ransoms of close to 40 million new pesos have been 
paid. 
  On 6 January 1993, for example, rancher and coffee-grower 
Joaquin Gutierrez Farrera was kidnapped. He was forcibly removed 
from a restaurant in the town of Rizo de Oro, in Cintalapa, by a 
group of seven heavily armed men, who took him into the 
highlands along the border with Oaxaca. A month later, on 17 
February, he was released, weighing 20 kilos less, after a 
ransom of 1.5 million new pesos had been paid. 
  A month later, on 20 February, rancher and merchant Ramon 
Wong Jimenez was kidnapped by another heavily armed group. "Men 
with light weapons cut him off on the coastal highway," said his 
driver, Luciano Dominguez Arreola. 
  On 8 November, ranchers Jorge Alfredo Chamlaty Espinosa and 
Arnulfo Puon Horita were kidnapped by six individuals carrying 
high-powered weapons. 
  Four days before, the leader of the Livestock Union of the 
Coast, Mario Monterrosa Reyes, had disappeared; he was released 
five days later after his relatives paid a ransom of 240,000 new 
pesos. 
  This is Monterrosa's account: 
  "They were passing themselves off as members of Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity (URNG). They belong to a Central 
American international command consisting of Guatemalans, 
Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, and Mexicans. They use 
R-15, AK-47, and M-16 automatic weapons and grenades. They also 
have a sophisticated radiocommunications network and information 
on persons likely to be kidnapped. They are only after money, 
and based on what they said, they need it to buy medicine, food, 
and weapons...."

  [Text] Torreon, Coahuila--"We are saying that things have 
to be transformed in our country and that the transformation has 
to be the work of the masses themselves...in a very strong class 
struggle, in a confrontation with the bourgeoisie. From that 
standpoint we have to wage a great revolutionary war." 
  So reads a document from Popular Line, a movement that began 
in this city in the early 1970's and later spread to other 
regions of the country, including the Chiapas jungle, where it 
sowed the ideological seeds of the guerrilla war, according to 
Jesuit priest Mardonio Morales. 
  According to the document, the Vietnamese started "with 
small 
bases that later grew larger, on the one hand. On the other, the 
bases were isolated, and they gradually integrated them. Our 
process has also been like this. We started with little points 
in various areas of the country, and these points have been 
spreading. In the beginning they were isolated; now they are 
being integrated...They are support bases for the revolutionary 
movement; they are the embryo of a Proletarian State." 
  According to the testimony and pamphlets compiled by this 
reporter, Popular Line's "little points" emerged in this city in 
1970 and soon spread to other towns in the Lagunera region, 
Coahuila, and Durango through the invasion of urban and rural 
lands. In addition, Popular Line's "cadres" came to dominate 
most of the schools of the Torreon Unit of the Autonomous 
University of Coahuila (UAC). During a second expansion phase in 
the mid-1970's the movement spread to Monterrey, Monclova, 
Durango, Valle del Yaqui (Sonora), Zacatecas, San Luis Potosi, 
Hidalgo, and the Chiapas jungle. 
  Popular Line, also known as the Mass Line, had the support 
of 
around 12 priests in the Lagunera region; they helped out in the 
efforts at consciousness-raising and organization among colonia 
[urban settlement] residents and peasants. 
  "We supported them because we saw it as organizational work, 
as furthering the common good, as a search for answers to the 
problems of the poorest people. It was overt work. We remained 
discreet in some matters, but there was no underground activity 
or apologies for violent solutions," several of these priests 
say. 
  Father Benigno Martinez says that brigade members of Mass 
Line penetrated the Chiapas jungle on the express invitation of 
the bishop of the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel 
Ruiz: "He was in Torreon, saw the work that they were doing, and 
liked it...And he invited them into Chiapas. That was in late 
1976." Two years before, Bishop Ruiz had said no to the Torreon 
Group, Father Mardonio told Guillermo Correa last September 
(PROCESO 880). 
  The same source says that the "visible heads" of the Mass 
Line movement are Adolfo Orive, the current director of training 
of the National Peasant Confederation (CNC), and Hugo Andres 
Araujo, a PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] deputy and 
leader of the confederation: "The one we had the most contact 
with was Hugo Andres, because he practically lived in La Laguna, 
although he traveled a lot. Orive, in contrast, showed up from 
time to time. Neither of the two liked to keep a high profile; 
they did not want to appear in the press or anything like that." 
Gustavo Gordillo, the current deputy secretary of the SRA 
[Secretariat of Agrarian Reform], was prominently involved in 
the Yaqui Valley; he later wrote about his experiences in his 
book `Campesinos al asalto del cielo' [Peasants Attacking 
Heaven]." 
  For a long time, says Father Benigno, "we believed naively 
that Araujo and Orive did not have political contacts. We 
thought that they were acting independently. We realized later, 
especially after 1976, that they have political godfathers...." 
  A native of Mexico City, where he graduated from the 
National 
School of Economics of UNAM [National Autonomous University of 
Mexico] (the 64-69 generation, according to the Biographical 
Dictionary of the Mexican Government), Araujo de la Torre 
settled in Torreon in 1970. He began working as a professor in 
the economics department, which at the time was part of the 
Humberto Perez Hinojosa School of Business and Management of the 
UAC (Perez Hinojosa was a Popular Line activist). For a month 
now he has been the PRI president in this municipality. 
  By 1971, the Popular Line philosophy, contained in a thin 
book called "Hacia una politica popular" [Towards a Popular 
Line], was already making the rounds in university circles, to 
which this reporter belonged. The 48-page text clarifies in its 
introduction that this is the second edition of a document that 
was originally written "by student brigade members for student 
brigade members. It was even written on the basis of a whole 
series of implicit assumptions about the student movement and 
severely criticizes certain tendencies that posed a very direct 
threat to the movement back in November 1968." 
  "Why publish it again then? The fact is that the document is 
a text suited to the present moment, inasmuch as it tells us 
what must be done urgently: to join with the masses to pursue a 
grass-roots policy with them. But it is also a text for the long 
term in that it proposes a grass-roots policy as a general 
political line to transform Mexico...This time the document is 
designed not only for students but for every Mexican who 
sincerely wants to engage in politics with the lower classes." 
  Through its brigade members, most of them university 
students, Popular Line steadily penetrated urban centers, 
particularly among colonia residents who lacked housing and 
public utilities. In 1972 it established its first "social 
support base": the Tierra y Libertad colonia. It was later 
joined by other colonias in the eastern outskirts of the city, 
including Francisco Villa and Division del Norte. In the nearby 
city of Gomez Palacio, the Ricardo Flores Magon, Ruben 
Jaramillo, and Jacinto Canek colonias were organized. 
  Father Jesus de la Torre, who helped organize these colonias 
and is currently in charge of public relations for the Torreon 
diocese, recalls how he had made contact with Popular Line: 
"Father Jose Batarse and I hosted a TV program, called Sign of 
the Times, in which we addressed social and political issues. It 
was an open program, so much so that we even criticized the 
waste during Luis Echeverria's presidential campaign. I assume 
that Adolfo Orive heard about us through this program; he sought 
us out and proposed that we work together." 
  He and other priests "were already doing work in very poor 
colonias. We were helping people organize to meet their needs. 
We started running into university brigade members...and we 
managed to get along, although not without some tension. Little 
by little we gained the ability to argue with them and we had it 
out on some issues. We cared about the people, not a given 
political line. What we saw was that all these joint efforts led 
to the development of a very broad solidarity movement and a 
very strong motivation to stay involved, which to us was 
inspired more by the Book of the Apostles than by Maoist texts." 
  The Popular Line people "were, I thought, quite studious, 
quite quick in analyzing the times, dogmatic on some issues. 
They were systematic, very pedagogical; they analyzed 
everything, from the president's reports to the pope's 
encyclicals...I never heard either the brigade members or Orive 
or Araujo talk in favor of weapons as an answer to problems, and 
I am not aware that they engaged in underground activities. To 
be sure, they acted with discretion, especially Araujo, who used 
to say that he had to be careful because he was not from La 
Laguna." 
  Benigno Martinez, the current parish priest in Concordia in 
the municipality of San Pedro de las Colonias, relates that in 
the early 1970's in the Torreon diocese "several of us priests 
were very motivated by the proposals in the Medellin documents. 
We were trying to get the Catholic movements to push forward and 
find options for a commitment in tune with the demands of the 
real world. One day Father Jose Batarse went to Durango to give 
a talk at the university, and in the audience was Adolfo Orive, 
who became very enthusiastic about what Pepe was saying." 
  Orive came to Torreon "and explained Popular Line's program 
to us. We thought that its proposals were very sensible and in 
accord with those of the Mexican Social Secretary. The point was 
to invigorate the intermediate bodies, in other words, to 
encourage people's involvement in decision-making, in opposition 
to the prevailing custom of having only the leaders of the 
colonias take action. The point was also to have the people take 
care of their needs and, at the same time, to grow politically 
and ideologically. We, as pastors, wanted to see their faith 
become an element that would revitalize an entire grass-roots 
process." 
  Once contact had been established with Orive, Araujo 
"introduced himself to us as a commissioner around 1971. Because 
he was a university student, he established connections there 
and won over people who later developed nicely, among them 
Miguel Murillo and Salvador Hernandez Velez (now a member of the 
CNC). We began to spur the worker-grass-roots movement, first by 
trying to democratize the railway union, Section 27. Then came 
the Tierra y Libertad colonia, in which what would become the 
Mass Line was established." 
  "First we identified the most strongly felt needs, and 
everyone who was experiencing the problem organized to solve it, 
not in a pyramid arrangement but rather by acting on the 
decisions of the rank and file. The colonia residents organized 
block assemblies, then sector assemblies, and finally came the 
general assembly, which was the highest body. Once this 
structure had been established, a brigade was formed with the 
most advanced elements, whose job was to guide the others. The 
brigade encouraged discussion and general involvement; it was 
what was called the ideological apparatus. There was also the 
political apparatus, which executed all of the resolutions: to 
go and see certain authorities, to hold rallies, demonstrations, 
etc." 
  The highest body of the Popular Line was the so-called 
Guiding Ideological Organization (OID), which was officially 
established in 1976 according to the document "Major Issues 
Concerning Our Line and Our Organization," published in June 
1978. 
  When Mass Line grew, both in this region and elsewhere, 
Father Benigno says, "the feuds in the top echelon, the OID, 
began, and two factions appeared in the organization: the 
so-called Proletariats, led by Adolfo Orive, and the so-called 
Christian Democrats or Ultrademocrats, represented by Araujo. At 
that time, Orive was in Monterrey.... The internal struggle led 
to the abandonment of the working-class colonias, emigration, 
and the so-called Policy of Two Faces (hit the internal enemy 
hard but pursue a policy of negotiations with the external 
enemy)." 
  "I do not know whether by pursuing this policy Orive and 
Araujo wound up working together for the government, thus making 
a turnaround that we still do not understand and that hurt a lot 
of people who believed in them, especially Araujo. He helped 
people discover how corrupt the system was...and now he is part 
of the system. What I do know is that the ideological struggle 
and the struggle for power that Orive and Araujo waged back then 
wound up separating them. Orive founded Proletarian Line, and 
Araujo continued with the Mass Line." 
  By 1976 the Mass Line had spread to several municipalities 
in 
rural La Laguna, in particular San Pedro in colonia Emiliano 
Zapata and Francisco I. Madero on the small estate Batopilas and 
in colonia 2 de Marzo. Several priests also helped out in this 
expansion, most prominent among them Benigno Martinez, Jesus de 
la Torre, and Jose Batarse. The latter relates that the shining 
moment during this stage was the struggle of the day laborers at 
the Batopilas winery (owned by Manuel Suarez). It began as a 
strike in January of that year to demand decent wages; then the 
workers invaded the lands in April to ask that they be turned 
into an ejido, which finally happened on 21 May. 
  During the invasion at Batopilas, Father Martinez asserts, 
"we started to realize Hugo Andres' political connections." The 
action triggered mobilizations in several municipalities, also 
demanding lands that were in the hands of latifundio holders. In 
response, the government of Oscar Flores Tapia began cracking 
down in October 1976. Araujo de la Torre, some 20 peasants, and 
Fathers Benigno Martinez and Jesus de la Torre were arrested and 
all thrown in prison in Saltillo. The priests were behind bars 
for five days, Araujo for two months. 
  In October 1976 Bishop Ruiz was in Torreon. "And it was on 
that occasion that he invited those of us in Mass Line to 
Chiapas," says Concha Castro, who back then was a brigade member 
and today is coordinating the opening of the CNC's Institute of 
Rural Area Studies in this city. "Some 12 of us brigade members 
went to Ocosingo. I was there from September 1977 to December 
1988. We took part in forming the `Quiotic ta Lecontusel' ejido 
union and we spurred several economic projects." 
  She says that the work of the Mass Line brigade members in 
the Chiapas jungle involved "organizing, raising the awareness 
of people through workshops and seminars, all designed to 
relieve the most pressing hardships. Our work was overt, not at 
all clandestine. Neither the communities nor we ever proposed 
violence as a way of resolving problems. If Father Mardonio says 
that we planted the ideological seed of the guerrilla war, that 
is his opinion. We never brought up the issue of the armed 
struggle, nor did people bring it up with us." She says that 
Araujo was not in Chiapas. 
  According to newswoman Olga Quirarte, who at that time was 
news chief for the paper LA OPINION, Araujo, his wife Carmen, 
and a lot of university students "went into the Chiapas jungle. 
Some returned very soon. Others, like Hugo Andres and Carmen, 
stayed for a few months. It was a sort of great March, an 
imitation of the one that Mao did into Beijing. When the Chiapas 
mosquitoes got the best of them, they left. It was the big 
pullback of 1968. There were not guerrillas; they were people 
who went to support the most backward people in La Laguna."

  [Text] The leader of the National Peasant Confederation 
(CNC), Hugo Andres Araujo, said that he was willing to have all 
leaders of the confederation investigated to clear up any links 
with the Zapatist National Liberation Army. Adolfo Orive, the 
CNC's director of training, denied that he had contributed to 
the violence in Chiapas, asserting that "a paramilitary group is 
using the peasants to set them at odds" and clarifying that his 
presence more than 15 years ago in Chiapas "is just history." 
  "We always promoted peasant economic organizations all over 
the country, but we have nothing to do with the violence in 
Chiapas," says Orive, the founder and head of Proletarian Line, 
a Maoist organization that is prominent in teacher struggles in 
Oaxaca and worker struggles in Monclova, Coahuila, and that 
"influenced" Chiapas political parties and peasant groups as of 
1974, according to Mardonio Morales, a Jesuit priest who has 
lived for more than 30 years in the Lacandon Forest (PROCESO 
888). 
  Orive explains that a week after Mardonio Morales said that 
he [Orive] and Hugo Andres Araujo paved the way years ago for 
the emergence of the guerrillas in Chiapas, the vicar general of 
the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas, Gonzalo Ituarte 
Verduzco, denied the charge. 
  Ituarte said that he met Orive when the latter was indeed in 
Chiapas, promoting credit unions and holding dialogues with 
peasants. "I am not aware of the rest. I do not know of his 
record as an official" (PROCESO 881). 
  Last September, the Jesuit priest revealed the existence of 
guerrilla groups in Chiapas, after asserting that the Torreon 
Group, whose visible leaders were Orive and Hugo Andres Araujo, 
had planted the ideological seed in 1974. 
  On Tuesday 4 March at the Agrarian Reform House, as a 
meeting, chaired by Araujo, about the impact of GATT on the 
country's farm sector was about to begin, Orive declined to go 
into detail about his work in Chiapas, although he did agree to 
talk about the charges against him: 
  "Unfortunately, there are a lot of newsmen who latch onto 
labels, which I imagine are very appealing...So there is really 
not much to talk about." 
  A nervous man of few words, the CNC official says that he 
worked in Chiapas 15 or 16 years ago, when he set up a credit 
union. 
  "That is history. It was a long time ago. All of it is in 
writing back there." 
  He was asked what he thought about Mardonio's comments and 
whether it was true that through those peasant organizations he 
contributed to the violence in Chiapas. He denies it, asserting: 
  "Otherwise, I would not be here. And that is not all. In 
documents from those people, when we were there, 15 years ago, 
they criticized us severely for being pro-government. The people 
of Chiapas know all this." 
  "So you had nothing to do with it?" 
  "Absolutely not. Our line is a public line, a very obvious 
one. We always promoted peasant economic organizations all over 
the republic. We never had anything to do with violence. 
Obviously we think that the rule of law, which has been 
violated, ought to be respected, that the peasants are being 
used to set them at odds...Because the problems of the peasants 
are one thing, and a paramilitary group that is using them is 
another." 
  Orive is in a hurry to join the meeting. 
  "What about the formation of the Proletarian Line 
groups...." 
  "That is all history. Let me get to the meeting." 
  "How do you see the situation in Chiapas?" 
  "It is stable, stable." 
  Also on 4 March, Hugo Andres Araujo stated that he and some 
of his colleagues promoted "successful economic organizations" 
in Chiapas. 
  He said that he knew "all of the Chiapas organizations" and 
that the first ones to come out against violence in Chiapas were 
Pajal, ARIC, and the Union of Unions, among others, which were 
"formed back in those years but are now without external 
guidance." 
  And he voiced this complaint: 
  "Now they want to keep quoting me...I do not want to get 
into 
a debate because it is irrelevant. The results of the work are 
there to see. My training inside the CNC has mainly been in 
economic organizations; today, it is in the economic and the 
political area." 
  He explained that he did most of his work in the La Laguna 
Region, Tamaulipas, Sonora, and San Luis Potosi ("which I can 
indeed talk about"), and he reiterated: "Many colleagues who 
formed those organizations are today leaders of municipal 
committees, mayors, or leaders of leagues that I am called upon 
to head today." 
  He then added: 
  "This clarification is in order because I will answer for 
all 
my work and its results. But it makes no sense for them to 
attack me now, really...What I will accept is that for 25 years 
I have been committed to the country's peasant organizations." 
  A day later, in an interview with the news program "Desde 
Mexico, Buenas Noches" [Good Night From Mexico City] on the 
Azteca TV Network, the CNC leader said that he was willing to 
have all CNC leaders investigated "to clarify any ties with the 
rebel group that took up arms in Chiapas." 
  Lastly, he clarified that the investigation should not be 
limited to the CNC but should instead include "all areas related 
to the state of Chiapas." And he asserted that if culprits are 
found, "the law should be enforced." 
  Gustavo Gordillo de Anda, the current undersecretary of 
agrarian reform and another of the founders and leaders of the 
peasant organizations, explains in his 1988 book "Campesinos al 
asalto del cielo; de la expropiacion estatal a la apropiacion 
campesina": 
  "Mass Line or Proletarian Line has been a political faction 
that has opposed the party framework which emerged from the 1968 
student movement and since then has done political work in major 
social movements." 
  His book, which relates the experience of the Coalition of 
Collective Ejidos of the Yaqui or Mayo Valleys in Sonora, 
clarifies that the faction's main goal, in contrast to leftist 
parties, was "that its political activities would not conform to 
instructions from outside the mass movement." 
  It adds: "The Popular Action Movement arose in the late 
1970's out of a confluence of union groups, intellectuals, and 
activists in the peasant movement. Subsequently, along with four 
other political organizations, it began what later led to the 
formation of the Unified Socialist Party of Mexico."

  [Text] Monterrey, Nuevo Leon--Popular Line (PP) emerged on 
the eve of the 1968 student rebellion in the Federal District, 
made its presence felt through brigades during that movement, 
later dispersed after the 2 October massacre in Tlatelolco, 
regrouped the following year, and again through brigade members, 
penetrated many communities around the country, including the 
Chiapas jungle, during the 1970's, some of the founders of the 
group have revealed. 
  College students, mainly from the UNAM's National School of 
Economics (the 1964-69 generation), came together to form PP and 
get it off the ground. Some of them were Alberto Anaya, Hugo 
Andres Araujo, Rolando Cordera, and Gustavo Gordillo, under the 
intellectual leadership of Adolfo Orive, who was their 
professor. Also contributing to the expansion of PP, with 
financial support, were officials in the governments of Luis 
Echeverria and Jose Lopez-Portillo, some of whom were members of 
that generation and are currently in the Salinas cabinet. 
  This information came to PROCESO from Agustin Acosta, 
Alberto 
Anaya, and Hector Camero, who founded one of the PP's 
strongholds, the Land and Liberty Popular Front, in this city. 
Interviewed separately, the three agreed that the PP never had a 
well-defined organization and that its growth led to fierce 
internal squabbling, which ultimately split it into two major 
blocs: Mass Line and Proletarian Line, led respectively by 
Araujo and Orive. 
  The distant forerunner of Land and Liberty, Costa related, 
was the movement that emerged in the Autonomous University of 
Nuevo Leon against the increase in fees in 1967. Acosta, then a 
student in the Department of Philosophy and Letters, was 
involved in the formation of the Coordinator of Preparatory 
Schools, which sought to expand the student movement with an eye 
towards incorporating it into grass-roots movements. The goal 
was achieved three years later when a group of college students 
backed 400 colonia residents from Topo Chico in their invasion 
of some lands, on which Land and Liberty was later to emerge. 
"We invaded...and three days later they pounded us out of there." 
  Nevertheless, he continued, "we realized that we had a gold 
mine there and that we had to start working in an organized 
fashion." The government, he explained, had the workers and 
peasants under control, but had neglected the new residents who 
were arriving in droves from the countryside and had no options. 
We saw that we could slip in there. We studied the 
situation...and we prepared to invade once again. On 30 August 
1971 we invaded the first colonia in the group that later formed 
the Land and Liberty Popular Front, colonia Martires de San 
Cosme." 
  Some months before, he recalled, Marcos Cruz, who was a PP 
brigade member in Durango, arrived in this city. He gave us a 
lecture, saying: `We are doing the same thing. We have a lot in 
common. We ought to work together.' And he left us the document 
that you talked about in PROCESO (897), `Hacia una Politica 
Popular,' so that we could study it." Then came Alberto Anaya, 
another brigade member in Durango: "He gave us the same speech 
and asked us to join the organization. Which one? I asked...The 
fact was that there was no such organization; there were just 
scattered groups of brigade members. He then asked me whether I 
wanted to know `the guy who has the whole story...' and I told 
him I did. This was how Adolfo Orive first came here. We had our 
first official meeting in April 1971. He recommended that we 
step up our political work, that we become more professional, 
that there was funding for this. And that was what happened." 
  Both Anaya and Cruz, who served as federal deputies in the 
1988-1991 Legislature representing the PMS [Mexican Socialist 
Party]-OIR-Mass Line coalition, later left Durango "because we 
called them back as reinforcements, but also because most of the 
cadres that they had over there split and joined the guerrillas. 
Many joined the 23 September Communist League." 
  Acosta recalls that in 1968 Acosta was in a postgraduate 
program on economic planning at the Advanced Teachers College in 
Paris. "He lived through May 1968 in France and, showing great 
intuition, sensed the coming worldwide revolt; he came back to 
Mexico in early July of that year and started giving economics 
classes at UNAM. His philosophy was quite well developed; it was 
Maoist, a product of the studies that he had done on the 
People's Cultural Revolution in China, particularly with 
Professor Charles Bettelheim, who was his adviser, the president 
of the French-Chinese Friendship Association, and the main 
Marxist theoretician of that revolution." 
  Orive, the son of Adolfo Orive Alva, the secretary of water 
resources under Miguel Aleman, had graduated as a civil engineer 
from UNAM in 1963. His thesis was entitled "Modern planning 
techniques for the comprehensive development of the Grijalba 
River Basin," which already evinced his interest in solving 
specific problems facing the country. 
  When the student movement erupted, Acosta said, "a lot of 
brigades were formed, and the factions began to multiply: the 
Communist Party, the Trotskyites, the Maoists...The latter had 
just emerged; its source was the Espartaco Communist League. The 
factions came together in the brigades, and the so-called 
Coalition of Emiliano Zapata Brigades was formed. It was the one 
that issued the first version of the document "Towards a Popular 
Line" (Originally "For a Popular Line"). Orive wrote it up, 
pursuant to a consensus among university professors, mostly in 
economics, among them Araujo, Gordillo, and Anaya." 
<H5>  The Brigades Regroup </H5>
  After the crackdown on the student movement, the brigade 
members scattered. Orive regrouped them in 1969, and a decision 
was made to implement the principles of the PP, a task that 
began the following year in several regions around the country. 
The first place was indigenous communities in Guerrero, Chiapas, 
and Oaxaca. They "did almost social-welfare work, sending in 
medical brigades, for example. Back then there was a lot of 
discussion about the best way to integrate with the masses...and 
splinter groups kept forming, later giving rise to other 
organizations, such as the Mexican Party of the Proletariat, 
which Gustavo Gordillo headed." 
  Anaya, a current leader of the Labor Party in this state and 
president of the Land and Liberty Popular Front, confirmed that 
the PP emerged "before 1968. It was based on Maoist principles 
concerning the so-called mass line, which basically says that 
everything has to come from the decisions of the people, on the 
basis of which a line of action is developed." 
  He pointed out that the PP did its work in three stages. The 
first was "integration with the masses and it ran from mid-1968 
to 1971. The second was mobilization of the masses, from 1971 to 
1976. The third was organization and consolidation of the mass 
groups and the construction of social support bases; we are 
still doing this work." The movement spread at first to Durango, 
Monterrey, Bahia de Banderas in Nayarit, the Yaqui Valley in 
Sonora, Las Truchas in Michoacan, Torreon, Monclova, Tlaxcala, 
and Zacatecas. 
  He explained that "the regions into which we went had been 
selected according to their political profitability, that is to 
say, the ones in which the people were willing to become 
involved." 
  The selection was also made on the basis of "Orive's 
political contacts and interests within the State apparatus," 
says Hector Camero, the current leader of the Land and Liberty 
Civil Association, a group that split from the Front that Anaya 
heads. For example, he notes, brigade members went to Las 
Truchas because the iron and steel plant was run by Orive's 
father, and they went to Bahia de Banderas because Orive himself 
worked there. 
  During the time that Orive worked in Monterrey, he adds, "we 
realized more clearly that he had political contacts at the 
highest level, including President Echeverria and his interior 
secretary, Mario Moya Palencia. Besides drafting PP documents, 
Orive was explicitly charged with raising funds for the 
movement, and we brigade members had only hints of where they 
came from. For example, he brought in vehicles from Las Truchas. 
Orive's and Anaya's contact man with Echeverria was the rector 
of the UANL, Luis Eugenio Todd." 
  Through Todd, Camero contends, Echeverria supported some of 
Land and Liberty's projects. 
  Acosta, who at present has his own law practice, says that 
Orive had "direct ties with Echeverria and was very good friends 
with his eldest son, Luis Echeverria Zuno; they studied together 
in Paris. As of 1971 Adolfo was very much involved in the Bahia 
de Banderas Trust. He did the organizing; I was there for four 
months." 
  Later, "we realized that other politicians were supporting 
the movement. In 1975 some of us brigade members were in the 
Huasteca Hidalguense [the Hidalgo State portion of the Huasteca 
region]. It was a dangerous zone, owing to the presence of the 
caciques' white guards, like the Austrias, so we needed cover 
for our work. We got it from Raul Salinas de Gortari, the 
director of rural roads for the SAHOP (Secretariat of Human 
Settlements and Public Works), who introduced us as researchers. 
Another who backed us was Emilio Lozoya; I do not recall what 
post he held at the time, but I once went with Orive to pick up 
money at his office." 
  "Humberto Perez Hinojosa, who was working with Araujo in La 
Laguna, once invited me to Manuel Camacho Solis's home in the 
Federal District. There were a lot of people there whom we had 
to tell what we were doing because of the financial support they 
were giving. That kind of thing bothered me. I felt like a 
clown, but Orive justified it...Lozoya and Camacho also studied 
economics at UNAM; hence their relationship with Orive and other 
members of that generation. The fact is that this support 
enabled us to maintain a roster of around 300 professional 
brigade members throughout the country from 1976 to 1979." 
  Camero recalls that in late 1975 "Orive settled here; we 
ourselves asked him to do so, to integrate with the masses, 
because he would only visit occasionally on the pretext that he 
had to raise funds. His presence was ill-fated; the cultural 
revolution that he advocated led to the death of six colonia 
residents on 18 February 1976." 
  Orive began his "cultural revolution" here with the argument 
that we had to wage a battle to the death against Social 
Democracy, represented by Anaya, because it put the leaders 
above the masses. The masses, Orive said, are the ones that must 
lead movements. He indicated that the leaders who do not teach 
these methods are bourgeois Social Democrats who must be swept 
away by the masses. In this way he carried the ideological 
struggle to bitter, terrible extremes." 
  Against this backdrop a problem arose in colonia San Angel, 
which is between colonias Francisco Villa and Tierra y Libertad, 
when some patrolmen arrested a group of colonia residents on 
charges that they had stolen electrical equipment: "We went to 
help our comrades. The patrolmen called for reinforcements, and 
just when we had reached an agreement with the police to release 
them, residents of colonia Francisco Villa showed up and began 
provoking them. They were people whom Orive controlled; he 
called them `red guards.' The police shot at them, killing six." 
  He charges: "Orive sent those comrades to their death. We 
did 
not criticize him publicly at the time, but we did complain to 
him in private. We told him that his cause had brought death. He 
said: 'Revolutions shed blood.' The fact is that his goal was to 
sweep away the leaders here." 
  After the slayings, Acosta says, the grass-roots movement 
posted "huge growth, in this city and in others, which also 
caused the organization to grow excessively...and the internal 
feuding to intensify. After the ideological battle that he had 
with Anaya in Monterrey, which in the end was just a struggle 
for control, Adolfo maliciously saw that the situation could be 
repeated in La Laguna, where Araujo was the natural leader. 
Orive himself had bequeathed that influence to him, just as he 
did with Anaya in Monterrey, but his disciples turned out to be 
cheeky. The fact is that Orive maneuvered to get Araujo to go to 
the Huasteca Potosina [the San Luis Potosi State portion of the 
Huasteca region]." 
  Araujo got to the region in early 1977, shortly after being 
released from prison in Saltillo, where he had been held for two 
months on orders from Governor Oscar Flores Tapia. "He arrived 
in the Huasteca Potosina with a lot of backing. His political 
contacts were very obvious by then, most notably with Raul 
Salinas de Gortari. The so-called Land and Liberty Camp was 
founded there, comprising a lot of ejidos near Ciudad Valles. 
Some of us brigade members settled in the Mezquital Valley, more 
or less where the Huasteca Potosina and Hidalguense meet. It was 
very difficult work, in communities as backward as the ones in 
Chiapas...and around which the army started building heliports 
as a precaution." 
  Meanwhile, Acosta continues, "Orive settled in Chiapas, 
where 
he had been making contact with religious groups since 1974. He 
lived there from 1978 to 1988. His presence has great 
significance in the region, given its characteristics. Suffice 
it to say that in 1988 he organized an assembly at which some 
2,500 Indians got together to discuss their problems. But I 
doubt whether Orive planted the ideological seed for the 
guerrilla war that has now erupted. He is very cool towards such 
things. What could have happened is that some of his people 
broke off and became radicalized, just like what happened with 
the network of catechizers that outstripped Bishop Samuel Ruiz." 
  Anaya: "The self-styled Proletarian Line, headed by Orive, 
worked in Chiapas to build social support bases by organizing 
the indigenous peasants economically and socially. He never 
proposed the armed struggle as a solution. He sought to combat 
the caciques and great estates and fought to start solving 
problems with the Chiapas governments, which at least over the 
past 15 years have been characterized by authoritarianism, 
political narrow-mindedness, and intolerance." 
  Camero concludes: "It would be going too far to say that 
Popular Line planted the ideological seed of the Chiapas 
guerrilla war. At least not its leaders, although some of its 
people may have split off and become radicalized. But I do not 
think it was people like Orive and Araujo. They showed their 
true faces a long time ago when they joined right in with the 
State apparatus. There is a reason why they are together in the 
CNC, to which in one way or another they were always linked, 
probably as part of a project that Echeverria started and the 
Salinas brothers later picked up again."

  [Text] The year was 1972. In Chilon, a Tzeltal area, the 
Morales Elizalde brothers, Mardonio and Ignacio, were 
enthusiastically translating the Bible into Tzeltal. They wanted 
to translate Exodus before any other book. Ignacio would say: It 
talks about the escape from Egypt, the move from servitude to 
freedom, the rebellion of the slaves, and their emancipation. It 
talks about the quest for the promised land. And they translated 
the Book of the Jewish Exodus. 
  In 1987, in the heart of the Lacandon Forest, Tzeltales, 
Tzotziles, Choles, Tojolabales, and mestizos from 117 ejidos and 
24 small villages gathered together in a multiethnic 
organization with its own unique identity. It was the exodus of 
the Mayas in search of the promised land, a new land, and a new 
life. 
  Las Canadas is a portion of the jungle in which the Union of 
Unions established itself in the late 1980's. It was formed by 
some 6,000 families living on ejidos and in small villages in 
the ravines, valleys, and plateaus of the eastern mountain range 
in the state of Chiapas. Ninety percent of its members had been 
peons on the corn, cane, ranching, and coffee estates in the 
municipality of Ocosingo. The other 10 percent are Indians from 
the north and Highlands of Chiapas. 
  The permanently resident rural estate peons left the estates 
and headed for the Desierto de la Soledad. It was the start of 
the exodus in the 1930's, a steady march that intensified in the 
1960's and lasted into the 1980's. They populated the jungle and 
organized in it. 
  Researcher Xochitl Leyva Solano has studied this exodus and 
its causes in a book the first version of which was presented as 
a paper at the Second International Mayanist Congress, which the 
Center for Mayan Studies and the Yucatan Institute of Culture 
organized in Merida in August 1992. A later version is 
summarized here. 
  The sense of community among the Indians is born mainly of 
two social practices: one that is pastoral and the other that is 
political and ideological. Pastoral activities were promoted in 
the jungle, drawing their inspiration from the major Church 
events of the 1960's, particularly the Second Vatican Council in 
the early part and the Medellin Bishops Conference towards its 
end, as well as liberation theology. 
  The political and ideological action was conducted by 
political factions and groups that emerged after the 1968 
student movement, which went beyond partisan and electoral 
political activity with the idea of going to the people and 
helping them. Many of their members were from the urban middle 
class. They were social workers who joined the social struggles, 
spurred the rise of independent peasant movements, or 
established themselves in the guerrilla movements in Guerrero, 
Chihuahua, and Sonora. In the cities of Monterrey, Durango, 
Torreon, and Chihuahua they helped organize the working-class 
colonias and urban social movements. They were groups like Union 
of the People (UP), Popular Line (PP), and the Guiding 
Ideological Organization (OID). 
<H5>  The Religious Community </H5>
  Pastoral action stemmed from the urgent need to create an 
identity and a sense of community, of belonging. First among the 
larger group, the poor, and then among a more specific group, 
"those of us who constitute a community," the collection of men 
and women who live in the same colonia and share an activism, a 
creed, a system of office-holding, a territory, a history, roots. 
  Liberation theology led them to analyze the real world, as a 
starting point, and to discover that "man has been crushed and 
dispossessed," and to demand that he be liberated from such 
oppression in today's world, in accordance with the Gospel of 
Saint Luke: "The Lord has sent me to announce the good news to 
the captive and to liberate all the oppressed." Hence the 
commitment to transform today's world, in which the poor are 
victims "of structural domination," in the words of Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz: "If we follow the option of the Gospel, we have to 
dismantle the structures that foster domination." 
  The permanently resident rural estate peons and the peons 
who 
emigrated into the jungle echoed this assertion and emphasized 
the social and ethnic distinction between them and their bosses. 
They were also able to identify with other Chiapas Indians with 
whom they had common problems: the Choles, Tzeltales, Tzotziles, 
and Tojolabales, as was made evident at the Indian Congress of 
1974 in San Cristobal de las Casas, where four shared problems 
were identified: land, trade, health care, and education. The 
congress had been a government initiative, but it wound up as a 
place where the Indians of Chiapas came together. 
  Liberation theology was the escape hatch from a past of 
"oppression and misery" on the estates. In the new colonias in 
the jungle they had to break drastically with the past and opt 
for a liberating alternative. They saw their days on the estates 
as an era of serfdom and poverty, toil and cruel masters. Hence 
the peasant war and liberation. In the pastoral action of the 
diocese they found the language and inspiration they needed to 
struggle against this past and rebuild their identity. 
  Liberation theology was complemented by the text of the 
Bible, especially the Book of Exodus: "The communities in the 
jungle were living their exodus." This is the book that tells of 
the rebellion of the Jewish slaves in Egypt and their exodus 
through the desert until they found a land on which they could 
settle and live, "the promised land." God ordered them to leave. 
From 1972 to 1974 the Book of Exodus was translated into 
Tzeltal, and there were discussions in the communities about 
freedom, faith, hope, and love. At first the missionaries 
summarized the material. Later, Indian catechizers did the 
writing. The lessons were then compiled in a catechism entitled 
"We Are Seeking Liberty" in the Tzeltal language. It draws an 
analogy between the migration into the jungle and the Jewish 
exodus. The sense of "we" thus emerged. 
  The catechism: "The Lord said to the Israelites when they 
were living as slaves: `I have seen the miserable state of my 
people. And now the cry of the sons of Israel has come to me. I 
mean to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians and bring 
them up out of that land to a land rich and broad where milk and 
honey flow.' God wants us to depart for freedom like the Jewish 
people of old, who lived in the lands of another people, called 
Egypt. The land did not belong to them; they worked as slaves 
and suffered much hardship. Then God spoke to the heart of one 
of the leaders: `I have seen the miserable state of my people, I 
have heard their appeal to be free of their slave-drivers. I 
have come to free you from your suffering and I am going to 
bring you to a better land.' And God said to Moses: `I order you 
to bring my people out of Egypt.'" 
  "God wants us to leave everything that crushes us. The word 
of God tells us that as a community we must leave to seek 
freedom. If we seek betterment and freedom, God will be with us. 
When the Israelites lived as slaves, they had to leave and fight 
for their freedom. When our forebears lived as servants, they 
too had to struggle together to win their lands. They were men 
of great faith. True freedom has not come yet. We must gather 
strength in our hearts and struggle and suffer much yet. We must 
fight against poverty, hunger, and injustice" (Exodus 3:7-12; 
Catechism 28, 51, 78, 106). 
  Expectations of a "new life" in the "promised land" in the 
jungle had been created. Saint Paul, in his letter to the 
Ephesians, speaks of the "new man." The Tzeltal catechism echoes 
him: "The new man is not a man alone, but rather a community 
man, united with all his brothers by the Spirit. Together we 
have a single thought, a single job, a single heart with one and 
the same Hope (Catechism 114)." 
  A reaffirmation of life in the community was needed in the 
search for an identity and new methods of organization. These 
reflections focused on issues such as the land and food, God's 
law and man's law, a given way of life (culture), the need for 
collective work, and shared decision-making. "Thought" is an 
individual's greatest strength and leads to action, "praxis." 
Indian culture was reaffirmed. 
  The residents of a colonia, meeting in a plenary session, 
issued regulations governing all spheres of life in society. 
"Through all that we do as a community we form a single heart in 
Christ. The work and love of the community is what brings us to 
freedom. The community is something that we must build day by 
day" (Catechism 30, 83, 101). 
  It was revolutionary to assert that social power was to be 
found in the thoughts of pioneer Indians. The catechizing 
process was a threat to the status quo. All were encouraged to 
become involved. What was needed was to express one's thoughts, 
to speak out, to read the word of God, to sing, to debate at the 
assemblies, to come out for or against resolutions, to erase the 
differences between ethnic and linguistic groups, to share a 
utopia: building the kingdom of God on earth, which guided work 
and life every day. Pastoral activities were eminently political 
because they threatened the dominant power structure. 
<H5>  The Political Community </H5>
  After the 1968 movement, a group of professors, students, 
and 
workers began waging a different struggle, whose watchword was 
"Let the people decide for themselves." They had "to integrate 
into the struggles of the working people, place themselves in 
service to the people, and help them organize and become more 
aware, so that they could carry forward their struggles." Live 
with the masses, stand by them in their daily struggle, and give 
them resources that will help them confront the "bourgeois, 
exploitative" enemy. 
  Activists from the Union of the People began arriving in the 
jungle in 1976 to work with the Catholics, pioneers, and colonia 
residents for whom the religious groups no longer sufficed to 
meet their demands for land, services, and infrastructure. Two 
years later the "northerners," activists from Popular Line, 
arrived. UP and PP were absorbed by a larger group, the OID. The 
organization that had called the Indian Congress reached its 
limit in 1977 and gave way to new political groups: PP, CNPA 
[National Coordinating Board for the Ayala Plan], CIOAC 
[Independent Federation of Agricultural Workers and Peasants], 
OCEZ [Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization], PST [Socialist 
Workers Party], and others, which offered viable alternatives in 
the face of the new realities. 
  Proletarian Line (LP) arrived in Chiapas in 1978. In the 
Lacandon Forest it worked with Quiptic (the union of ejidos), 
with Land and Liberty, and with Peasant Struggle; in Simojovel, 
Tila, Sabanilla, Huitiupan, and El Bosque, with the ejidos and 
peons from the regional organization; in La Fraylesca, with the 
ejidos that had made up the 10 April Peasant Alliance; in 
Venustiano Carranza and Villas las Rosas, with the Indian 
community members. It teamed up with students, colonia 
residents, and workers. In 1979 it joined the struggle of 
Chiapas teachers. Some authors and analysts blame the LP for the 
destruction of the regional processes and the disintegration of 
influential peasant cadres. 
  Proletarian Line and Mass Line (LM), which were the 
ideological lifeblood of many political advisers swarming about 
the jungle, emerged as the result of a split with Popular Line 
over theoretical and tactical disagreements, mainly with regard 
to the relations that ought to exist between the rank and file 
and the leadership. There were also "fundamental disagreements" 
in the OID. 
  The political structure superimposed itself on the religious 
structure, and in spite of serious differences Line reinforced 
and invigorated the sense of community and the broader methods 
of organization, such as the unions of ejidos. Line started from 
the "deeply felt needs of the working people" and defended the 
idea of joining with the working class, of having the workers, 
peasants, colonia residents, students, small businessmen, shop 
clerks, and professionals march together. The Indians living in 
the jungle were being brought into a movement that went beyond 
the local level. 
  A 1979 Line Document says: "We must take part in and lead 
the 
struggles of the peasants for land, credit, etc., the struggles 
of the workers for higher wages, better benefits, against 
corrupt union bosses, etc., the struggles of the students for 
better teachers, to democratize education, for school buildings, 
for scholarships, etc., and the struggles of all social groups 
and the people in general for better living conditions." 
  The slogan "of the masses, by the masses, for the masses" 
meant the involvement of all, the expression of ideas, 
decision-making, promoting organization. "The people as a whole 
must take part in decision-making. Such participation means 
discussing several ideas. A pure struggle of ideas does not help 
the people; it is an exercise for bourgeois intellectuals. After 
discussions, decisions must be made. Resolutions and decisions 
chart the course. Making decisions is a political practice that 
unites comrades. We must have the broadest democracy, which 
means the wide-ranging input of ideas and opinions. Based on the 
people's most deeply felt demands, mass organizations must be 
formed." It also had its own utopia: a society free of 
exploiters and exploited. 
  The two movements, political and religious, ran parallel. 
The 
political groups came later, entrenching themselves in the 
religious movement and giving it a political bent. They both 
promoted community life and involvement; they established 
regulations, systems of office-holding, and commissions; they 
called for radical change spurred by the poor, and shared a 
utopia: the struggle here and now for a just, egalitarian 
society. 
  They had their differences, though. As far as the political 
leaders were concerned, the process was "guided." To the 
theologians, the process was "accompanied." The key point to the 
theologians was to revitalize Indian culture. As far as the 
political leaders were concerned, the revolutionary subjects 
were the proletariat, dispossessed peasants, and the working 
class. The mutual accusations were ongoing and obvious. Their 
differences of opinion reached the point that the Indians in the 
jungle expelled the northerners in the late 1970's. 
<H5>  The Agrarian Conflict </H5>
  Various timber companies had developed the Lacandon Forest 
last century. Later, the lands there were sold off, subdivided, 
or designated as national property. Some years into this 
century, great forest estates coexisted with great cattle 
estates, which the Indians called "fincas." As they moved into 
the jungle, the Indians of the exodus harmed powerful interests, 
including those of the government. 
  It was Luis Echeverria who decreed that communal assets be 
returned. Some 60 Lacandon families and some 30 colonias of 
Mayan Indians, comprising about 4,000 families in all, the 
Indians of the exodus, lived in the jungle. In a presidential 
decree Echeverria "returned" the entire Lacandon Forest, 614,321 
hectares, to the Lacandon Indians, ignoring the Mayas. The 
president spoke of restitution to the "rightful owners." 
Historians have proven that there is no continuous link between 
the Lacandons of history and today's Lacandons. The Tzeltales, 
Tzotziles, and Choles were excluded and legally expelled in 1972. 
  Hiding behind the presidential decree were business and 
timber interests, especially the National Finance Company 
(Nafinsa), which through the Lacandon Forestry Company, S.A. 
(Cofolasa) wanted to haul off the mahogany and cedar. No sooner 
had the jungle been deeded over to the Lacandons than Cofolasa 
signed a contract with them for some 35,000 cubic meters a year 
of timber (around 10,000 trees a year) over a 10-year period 
without a set price. 
  The government said that the Mayas had to be relocated in 
order "to preserve the forest." Some 20 colonias agreed to a 
relocation, thanks to the president's promise that they would 
have secure land tenure, utilities, and infrastructure; he never 
kept his promise. 
  Echeverria's decree was published in 1972. There was a 
pressing need to crowd them together again. Moves against the 
Mayas were not long in coming. The Indian assemblies, the 
discussions, and the decision-making then followed. They decided 
to reject relocation. This was the rallying point around which 
Quiptic, the Union of Ejidos, and the Union of Unions were 
formed and took action. The entire organizational structure that 
had been tried out day after day for such a long time was taking 
action and it grew strong in defense of the new land, which 
represented a new life, both of which had been shattered by 
presidential decree. 
  A new identity had been born. The Indians' experience of 
religion and politics charted the course for the agrarian 
struggle that was waged in the 1970's and 1980's. The Indian 
Congress had set the process in motion in October 1974, and it 
culminated in January 1994 with the armed uprising.

<F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Ramirez] </F>
  [Text] The left-wing political groups that came to Chiapas 
from Torreon took advantage of the religious infrastructure 
created by the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas and carried 
on their work in the Highlands and the Lacandon Forest using 
language that was not only Marxist but atheist as well. They 
gave rise to the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization (OCEZ). 
Close to 200 catechizers went into 200 communities to spread the 
new ideas and set up economic and political organizations. They 
had already changed their way of thinking. Later came the 
repression and institutionalized violence. It was in this 
context that the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) issued 
its declaration of war. 
  This was, in summary, the account that Bishop Samuel Ruiz 
gave of the way that the social movement which gave rise to the 
EZLN was born. He was speaking at the meeting that the members 
of the Plural Commission of the Standing Committee of the 
Congress of the Union held in San Cristobal de las Casas on 13 
January with bishops from the southern Pacific coast region. The 
commission had been formed to analyze the events in Chiapas. 
  The members of the commission reported that they held this 
and other meetings a few days after the outbreak of fighting on 
1 January. They did not reveal their substance, however. PROCESO 
now has a copy of the shorthand version of the talks between 
lawmakers and bishops. 
  Attending the meeting, among other legislators, were 
Benjamin 
Gonzalez Roaro, Jorge Tovar Montanez, Blanca Ruth Esponda, Juan 
Ramiro Robledo, Jorge Moscoso, Alvaro Salazar, Adolfo Kunz 
Bolanos, Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi, Jesus Martin del Campo, and 
Alejandro Encinas. Representing the Ecclesiastic Commission 
were, in addition to Samuel Ruiz, Felipe Aguirre Franco and 
Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel, the bishops of Tuxtla Gutierrez and 
Tapachula respectively; Adolfo Suarez Rivera, the archbishop of 
Monterrey and president of the Mexican Episcopate; the 
archbishop of Oaxaca, Hector Gonzalez; the bishop of 
Coatzacoalcos, Carlos Talavera, and the Dominican bishop, Raul 
Vera. 
  During the meeting Samuel Ruiz warned of the danger that 
once 
peace has been achieved, "if the military takes a military 
approach, they will observe the subsequent pacification stage in 
a military way, and there could be a witch hunt. I am not 
emphasizing anything; I just want to point out this risk." 
  "If we are unable, right now, to see things in a positive 
light," he added, "if we are going to look at our brothers with 
prejudice, then obviously we are going to be the first ones to 
hamper a reconciliation...This requires an attitude of fairness, 
an attitude of honesty, an attitude of understanding, and an 
attitude of humaneness, with a change on our part in order to 
break with the structures that are hurting them." Chiapas is not 
just the Zapatist National Liberation Army, was the comment at 
the meeting, during which criticism of all sorts was voiced of 
the Mexican political system, neoliberal policies, and the FTA, 
inasmuch as the conflict is not only with the group that has 
taken up arms "but also has other areas of concern in the 
different spheres of government and society." 
  Bishop Felipe Arizmendi: 
  "The answer to why all this happened is mainly poverty, 
exploitation, and injustice...The fact is that the entire 
economic system in which we live, not just in Mexico but all 
over the world, the entire neoliberal system of the market 
economy has to be reassessed, and it has to be a serious 
reassessment at the level of the world economy, not just 
nationally and not just in Chiapas. What is happening to us? 
These mechanisms are forgetting about the poorest people. All 
this is for the big businessmen, the big power groups. And what 
about all these people? In general, it is the type of economy 
that we have in the world, which is not an economy of 
solidarity, an economy of sharing, of justice. It is an economy 
of seeing who can make more any way he can. We must not forget 
this, because if we only take an Alka-Seltzer for the problem 
and fail to treat it more seriously, sooner or later it is going 
to explode everywhere." 
  "What do you know about the direction of this armed 
movement? 
Is it primarily local, specifically in terms of the top 
echelon?" PARM [Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution] 
Deputy Adolfo Kunz Bolanos asked Samuel Ruiz. 
  The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas diocese gave a 
wide-ranging account of how the social movement that led to the 
actions of the EZLN was born. The following is a summary of the 
verbatim transcription of his remarks: 
  That is a difficult question, because I do not know the 
answer. I am going to say what I know. 
  I will go far back. When I arrived here, I knew that Castro 
Ruz had gotten training in the Chiapas jungles and that he had 
even been in Yucatan. This was mentioned there with great 
admiration. 
  During Echeverria's term there were two guerrilla forces in 
the jungle: a right-wing guerrilla force, maintained by the 
left, and a left-wing guerrilla force, maintained by the right. 
I mention this merely to point out that the situation in the 
jungle, because it is a jungle, was tense. A favorable moment 
arose, however, and the situation was gotten under control. 
  There was a pretty strong movement in Torreon, and several 
agitators were jailed. Bishop Fernando Romo, a friend of mine, 
was in very close touch with us on occasion. I went there, to 
Torreon, and marveled at the discipline and organization of the 
grass-roots forces, which caused quite a serious problem for him 
that he could find no way to resolve. 
  I saw that organization over there and, seeing the political 
backwardness of the community, I said here: When will something 
like that come to Chiapas and raise people's consciousness? Some 
of the people who were listening just stared at me because I was 
talking with someone in that movement. "Some day," he told me, 
but very cynically. Four months later we saw them here. And very 
soon they started using our infrastructure. They were supposed 
to give one poor nun some clothing in a package, and it turned 
out to be outright subversive propaganda. They lied outrageously 
to us...That situation was exposed. 
  They wanted to take over the entire religious structure, the 
structure of the catechizing religion. Several members of the 
communities, particularly catechizers, were "hauled off," and 
some went voluntarily, with different tendencies. So, at a given 
moment in some places in the Chol Zone, for example, that 
movement co-opted several communities and turned the hermitages 
into barns for growing coffee or storing corn. 
  At the same time, their language was not just Marxist but 
atheist as well. I was very pained to hear one catechizer say: 
"I wipe my ass with the Bible." Forgive me for repeating this. 
But I was terrified at how these people had made a complete 
turnabout. I also remember hearing the Indians say things like: 
"We have to begin building a movement, not a political movement 
but our movement." It was at this point, as far as I can recall, 
that the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization was born, very 
near to where we are speaking. 
  So this became more or less well-known and grew in different 
areas. The southern Pacific coast region looked on when the time 
came for the political opening to register parties. And the 
entire southeast area, including Veracruz and this whole section 
of Oaxaca and Chiapas, saw the extraordinary emergence of a 
whole array of political positions, despite the cultural and 
linguistic barriers, because they were a response to longing of 
the Indians, of the peasants for specific support at that 
moment, with the growing awareness that their lands had been 
snatched from them. Their consciousness was raised, and we 
ourselves are not far removed from a consciousness-raising 
effort there. 
  Two-hundred catechizers went into 200 communities when this 
situation arose. The catechizers are the ones who reap the 
harvest of a community's thinking. Their way of thinking had 
already changed. Imagine what sort of consciousness-raising the 
communities were undergoing. Economic and political 
organizations, ejido associations, internal organizations, and 
cultural groups too emerged. 
  This is the background to what would be called evangelizing 
action. It is clear that political decisions and choices were 
made in the wake of it. I would have been the unhappiest bishop 
in the world if after 30 years of work there had been no 
consciousness-raising about the political involvement of the 
laity. 
  Several other factors had an influence. Another result was 
the subsequent repression, because there is institutionalized 
violence: 15,000 Indians starved to death in Chiapas last year; 
this is institutional violence. Then came repression in the 
indigenous areas, and a second wave of violence, and finally a 
desperate counterviolence, which we call violence without 
remembering that a previous violence caused it. 
  The most recent movement and the repression arose in this 
context. It was so discreet that four days before it began an 
Indian brother, a father, came to me and said: "Bishop Ruiz, 
what is going on? My son always obeys me, but he has taken off 
on me. He is off to liberation, to freedom." It was so discreet 
that not even families themselves knew who was in the movement 
or not. 
  We obviously noticed certain signs. To tell them that what 
they were thinking was crazy was not possible in historical 
terms, because desperation is stronger than idleness. We only 
knew very hypothetically what towns or municipalities they were 
in. We thought that they were confined to a quite limited area, 
but in the last few months of the year we got a broader, more 
alarming picture. 
  As late as 4 November, when this sacred national emblem was 
presented to me, I submitted to the authorities the latest 
report by our Human Rights Center, listing all of the awful 
violations that had been committed up to then. I put it there 
along with a medal of the Virgin of Guadalupe. We always made 
this effort, but they operated so discreetly, I repeat, that 
although we noticed certain signs, we were never able to see 
that the movement had external leadership, though I think there 
is some internal leadership as well. But we cannot therefore 
say: This is the leadership that is responsible for the 
reasoning that the Indians are doing about their own 
hunger-stricken conditions. [end of Ruiz remarks] 
  Deputy Jorge Tovar of the PPS then asked whether there had 
been mass bombardments of the population. Samuel Ruiz replied 
that he had heard of them from parishioners in several towns: 
  "We do not know how many people died there. We were told of 
four missing persons in just one community, but I do not know 
whether they have reappeared. Deputy Blanca Ruth Esponda has 
told us that we all have to work together to prevent violence. 
But there is a kind of violence that has nothing to do with the 
violence of weaponry. It is the other kind of violence, which we 
have already made a custom, which we have thoroughly accepted, 
for which we too are to blame: institutionalized violence." 
  Bishop Suarez Rivera spoke up to say that based on Monsignor 
Ruiz's explanation, the Zapatist movement is made up of people 
from Chiapas, "but there must also be people from outside 
Mexico." 
  "Monsignor Ruiz himself was telling us that in the past 
there 
were suspicions that Fidel Castro Ruiz himself (laughter)...Ruiz 
and some other people were here...." 
  Ruiz remarked that people still think that the Indians are 
mentally retarded: "During the Indian Congress we had to select 
among 50 candidates who wanted to be translators, all of whom 
spoke four or five languages besides Spanish. I am giving this 
background so you know what we are talking about." 
  He reported that 23 percent of the Guatemalans in the 
refugee 
camps have relatives or close friends in Chiapas, according to 
official figures, and that after their first return to their 
country, 43 percent had become Mexican. 
  "In short, what we have seen so far is that there is a 
single 
presence and leadership (the EZLN), represented by Subcommander 
Marcos. There may be some foreigners, we do not deny this, but 
we would be getting off the track if we thought that since the 
word for `hunger' in Tzotzil and Tzeltal is `huinal' and Marxism 
calls it class struggle, they mean the same thing." 
  In response to a question from PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] Deputy Alvaro Salazar, Samuel Ruiz 
explained how he came to be the mediator in the armed conflict 
in Chiapas: 
  "I hastened to give my response because I had already 
offered 
to do it. Rigoberta Menchu called me up and said: `Did you hear 
what happened?' I became alarmed: `What happened?' `Haven't you 
read LA JORNADA?' `No, it hasn't come yet. It's four in the 
afternoon. What happened?, tell me,' I asked her anxiously. She 
said: `Well, there's a communique, a fax, proposing me, you, and 
Julio Scherer as intermediaries.' So, I then tried to get in 
touch with Julio. He was not in. I left him a message...I would 
have liked for us to agree on a joint statement about the 
situation. Because no one received a direct communique, it 
seems. They did not ask me in writing to mediate. Therefore, I 
replied not to what they should have sent but to what appeared 
in the press, because I reacted to the communique. 
  "When they were here at city hall, it would have been 
extremely simple, but by the time I offered to mediate, the 
Zapatists had already left the city. It would have been easy; I 
was just a few steps away, and communication with the people was 
extraordinarily good. I gave my sermon on the last day of the 
year, summarizing the pope's words and talking very vigorously 
about democracy and peace, without realizing that peace was 
going to give way to shooting at midnight...." 
  At the meeting with the deputies and senators Bishop Samuel 
Ruiz also stated that he had definite suspicions ("I think that 
these suspicions are strongly confirmed") that there was no 
fighting in several communities "because the people there are 
Zapatists in their hearts, although they do not belong. Let us 
consider how bad the conditions are and to what extent the 
Indians have progressed. How could this have not exploded years 
ago, don't you think?" 
  He then gave another lengthy explanation of the religious 
conflict between Catholics and Evangelicals in Chiapas. He said 
that the problem did not arise just a year or two ago; it has 
been awaiting a solution for 20 years: "It should be made clear 
that both Catholics and Evangelicals have been displaced by the 
caciques, who wear religious masks but obviously have political 
and financial interests. I have my theory. I could be wrong, but 
we can see that Chiapas is the political springboard for 
Mexico's Indian movement." 
  According to Ruiz, the cause of the conflict is the fact 
that 
the sects clearly identify those who do not belong to them and 
have very odd recruitment methods and that some of their members 
talk about the people whom they fail to recruit with remarks 
like "they're children of the great harlot," "666, the mark of 
the beast," and "we're going to burn their little idols on All 
Saints Day." The reactions have been brutal. 
  "It finally got to the point that we refused to let them 
into 
the religious services on the feast of San Juan Chamula. And 
then they called in pseudo-bishops. They said to us in so many 
words: We are from the PRI. We have come here to help you. And 
we are not going to ask you for anything, no requirements like 
the ones Bishop Samuel Ruiz sets." 
  He said that "other interested parties arrived later. 
Initially there were 40 people, and later 200, working as spies 
who followed the Chamulas during their Catholic services and 
putting their names on a black list. There was a little bit of 
everything: jailings, torture, killings, taxes, looting, 
robberies." 
  "Although the number seems exaggerated, there are 25,000 
Chamulas living outside their communities, Catholics and 
Evangelicals, who preferred to stick to their convictions rather 
than hold onto their belongings. Our Chamula brothers have borne 
witness to their martyrdom." 
  Samuel Ruiz recalled that the pastoral action of San 
Cristobal diocese has also been blamed for the lack of unity 
among indigenous communities. He related the following anecdote, 
involving the Chamula mayor and an Indian: 
  "Domingo, you have to be patient. You know that things are 
being taken care of." 
  "We have been patient for 20 years, sir. Right now our 
patience has not run out on us yet. What we are running out of 
is room to live." 
  Bishop Gonzalez Martinez said that since the middle of last 
century the authorities have been encouraging the arrival of 
[Protestant] religious sects in order to weaken the Catholic 
Church. 
  "This event has changed Mexico, and we hope that people 
realize now that in the specific case of Chiapas all sectors 
must pay attention but also that we have to somehow change the 
political situation in the state and find common ground among 
all of the sectors in the state, above all to improve the living 
conditions of the population," said PRD [Party of the Democratic 
Revolution] Deputy Jorge Moscoso. 
  He said that he was convinced that the members of the EZLN 
"are making a very difficult contribution that is being heavily 
criticized for its methods but not its causes. No one in this 
country has denounced the underlying causes of this situation. 
So then, when all is said and done, this obliges us lawmakers 
and bishops to get together and create a new framework in the 
country." 
  PRD Deputy Jesus Martin del Campo explained that the 
presence 
of the lawmakers in San Cristobal de las Casas could do much to 
reinforce the effort and develop a solution that would prevent 
more Mexicans from dying in this conflict. 
  Bishop Adolfo Suarez: 
  "I would like to emphasize, as Bishop Arizmendi was saying 
here, that only certain sectors in the state are being protected 
because they are the ones whose voices can exert the most 
influence. The most vulnerable sectors, such as the ones that we 
have found in Chiapas, very specifically the Indian people, have 
even been excluded from legislation that would more justly 
acknowledge the value of their cultures, their values, and their 
contribution to the country." 
  Bishop Carlos Talavera: 
  "Economic democracy, social democracy, and cultural 
democracy 
have already been mentioned. It seems to me that if we really 
want a shift towards democracy, it must happen in all aspects of 
life. I, for example, ask myself: Why are there caciques? Why? 
And why can't we do anything about them?" 
  Bishop Raul Vera: 
  "In order to really begin building a more participatory 
society, which would be the start of a true democracy, in order 
to really bring about change in Chiapas and throughout the 
country, we have to make a personal conversion, a change of 
mind-set, whereby we value the whole individual as an 
individual, and these individuals themselves can be major 
players, in their own sphere and with their own resources, to 
help exalt our country."

<F P=106> [Article by Rodrigo Vera] </F>
  [Text] The charges against Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San 
Cristobal de las Casas, to the effect that he promoted the armed 
movement in Chiapas, intensified last week in several national 
publications. 
  The charge was echoed in editorials, articles, and 
interviews 
with priests and Indians displaced by the fighting, mainly in 
the daily EL UNIVERSAL and the weeklies IMPACTO and SIEMPRE!. 
  In its 24 February editorial, entitled "The Apostle of the 
Activism," IMPACTO says: 
  "In his statements Bishop Ruiz has been on the verge of 
giving in to his activism and revealing himself as a fundamental 
part of the machinery that manufactured the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN), the guerrilla organization in which he 
may have cloaked his true ambitions. We need not wrack our 
brains analyzing his statements, observations, recommendations, 
and `conciliatory' remarks to realize that Bishop Ruiz runs the 
risk of being overtaken by emotion and shouting: We won! Or Did 
I win?" 
  It goes on to say that Samuel Ruiz "knows more than he is 
admitting publicly" and that "to achieve his objective the 
bishop used the hunger and poverty of the Indians." 
  In the editorial in its 3 March edition IMPACTO says: 
  "No one should be fooled if the politicized clergyman goes 
further and seeks to divide up the country for himself. The 
`enlightened' bishop has already set the tone and with his hosts 
of catechizers, diocesans, nuns, and, in short, members of 
religious orders from here and there, has had an excellent 
laboratory in which to cultivate the wrath, frustrations, and 
offensive and denigrating neglect of the Indians to set them 
against the government and then harvest the fruit of a forbidden 
tree." 
  IMPACTO does not think that either Manuel Camacho Solis 
("owing to his personal ambitions") or the Zapatist delegates 
would dare to "unmask" the bishop and finger him "as a commander 
of the guerrillas." 
  In its 2 March issue SIEMPRE! asserts in an editorial that 
Samuel Ruiz, along with Camacho Solis and Commander Marcos, 
"have turned the war in the Lacandon Forest into a Hollywood 
spectacle in which each actor seeks to play the day's leading 
role." 
  It sees the Chiapas conflict as "shady and odd," and the 
manipulation of it by Zapatists and peace-makers "seems more 
like a theatrical production staged for the mass media than a 
bloody war the main cause of which is supposedly the social 
tragedy of the Indian communities." 
  It concludes: 
  "Only time will put each of the players who have taken part 
in this war in their proper place. The central figures in it 
have been neither the Indians nor Zapata the revolutionary but 
rather three men who for different reasons are hungry for 
publicity and power." 
  In a feature article entitled "Landowner, subversive, and 
enemy of the middle class. The other face of Don Samuel," 
SIEMPRE! reveals in the same edition, without citing sources, 
the properties that the bishop allegedly owns, some of which 
were used to train the guerrillas: 
  "Two of the ranches are in the municipality of Ciudad 
Cuauhtemoc, Chiapas, one called Santa Clara and another La 
Gloria, previously San Caralampio. There are those who say that 
the bishop has hundreds of guerrillas hidden at present on this 
ranch, as they prepare to take action in southeast Mexico. 
  "The bishop acquired other real estate in the area near the 
Guatemalan border: Gloria Huanacaston (purchased by someone 
named Braulio Hernandez); Tepancuapan (bought by Father Alfredo 
Inda Andrio); La Esmeralda, San Lorenzo, El Naranjillo, El 
Porvenir 1 (which is believed to have been used by Guatemalan 
guerrillas as a hospital and rest area), El Porvenir II (also 
bought through Father Inda Andrio), the San Pedro ranch, and the 
Guanajuato ranch." 
  Last week EL UNIVERSAL published a series of interviews with 
Indians and priests in which they accused the bishop of 
promoting the armed struggle. 
  Diego Andres, the priest in Bochil, Chiapas, indicated that 
the leader of the EZLN is a former seminarian from the diocese 
of San Cristobal and that the catechizers, with the support of 
Samuel Ruiz, have gone around giving military training to 
believers. 
  Otilio Lopez Lopez, a former vicar of Ocosingo, related that 
three years ago he spoke out against the imminent uprising to 
Jeronimo Prigione, the apostolic nuncio in Mexico, who merely 
told him that there were a "heap of charges" against Samuel Ruiz 
but that the Vatican had not yet given him any instructions. 
  According to him, the Gospel that the San Cristobal bishop 
is 
promoting is "ideologized, with pamphleteer phrasing and 
classist slogans." He cited the names of priests who had to 
leave because they did not agree with the bishop's line: 
  Heberto Jose Morales, a former rector of Chiapas Autonomous 
University, Antonio Patino, Elias Martinez Bulmaro Gordillo, 
Aurelio Zapata, Cecilio Baraibar, Oscar Macias, and Jose Reyes 
Angel. 
  He mentioned others who asked to be transferred to another 
diocese, among them Pedro Ramuco (today in Zamora), Pablo 
Arenas, Jose Conrado Ruiz, and Jose Inocencio Galvan (in 
Guadalajara). 
  According to EL UNIVERSAL, representatives of more than 
8,000 
Indians from 35 communities were in Mexico City to try and see 
Prigione to find out whether Pope John Paul II had replied to 
the letter in which they complained about Samuel Ruiz, who 
because they failed to support his "liberation church" 
"punished" them by refusing them the sacraments. 
  The letter, which was submitted to the pontiff during his 
visit to Yucatan last August, said that as a result of the 
"punishment" imposed by Samuel Ruiz, 460 children had not been 
baptized, 262 couples had not been married, and 884 persons had 
not received confirmation; they added that Ruiz's "catechizers 
are forcing the Indians to sing `Juan the landless' and `30-30 
carbine.'" 
  The Indian leaders who were interviewed, "Brother Juan" and 
"Brother Pedro," said of the bishop: 
  "Don Samuel is a friend of the Zapatists. He organized 
everything."

<F P=106> [Undated letter to the editor by apparently former priest </F>
Oscar Macias] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Don Samuel's Priests </H5>
  The Editor: 
  I am writing to you to clarify something in Rodrigo Vera's 
article on page seven of Issue 904 of PROCESO (28 February). 
  This is in connection with the campaign that EL UNIVERSAL, 
SIEMPRE!, and IMPACTO are conducting to lay the blame for the 
armed uprising in the Chiapas Highlands on Samuel Ruiz, the 
bishop of San Cristobal. 
  The article says that Father Otilio Lopez Lopez said that 
several priests from the diocese of San Cristobal left because 
they disagreed with Bishop Ruiz's pastoral line. 
  Among the priests it mentions are Oscar Macias, Jose Reyes 
Rangel, Aurelio Zapata, and Pedro Ramuco. 
  I disagree completely with Otilio; his assertion is false 
and 
deceitful. I am Father Oscar Macias. I worked in the northern 
area of the Chiapas Highlands from 1962 to 1983. I did my work 
in Yajalon, Tila, Tumbala, Salto de Agua, and a bit in 
Sabanilla: five municipalities, one of them Tzeltal and four 
Chol. I spent 15 of those years, up to 1983, in the Tila parish 
working with my Chol brothers. I performed my work in full 
support of the pastoral line that we and Don Samuel were 
pursuing in the diocese. The reason for my leaving the diocese 
and the parish was totally and exclusively personal. I had 
fathered a child and gotten married; I currently live in the 
state of Morelos. 
  As for the colleagues of mine whose names are mentioned, I 
would dare say that Don Samuel's pastoral line was not the 
reason for their departure. 
  Jose Reyes Rangel (may God keep him in his Kingdom) saw his 
addiction to alcohol worsen and had to leave. Aurelio Zapata, 
who like me is from Chapa de Corzo, devoted himself generously 
to the peasants of Zocoltenango and suffered reprisals from the 
cattlemen: he was kidnapped and tortured for several days. He 
has recovered slowly and incompletely; he is unable to work. 
Pedro Ramuco was of great help to Don Samuel as vicar general of 
the diocese. He left because of a severe nervous breakdown 
caused by death threats owing to his pastoral work with the 
peasants. 
  As for the three other priests that Otilio mentions, Jose 
Conrado Ruiz was already elderly and fell ill; Juan Inocencio 
Galvan was or is a traditionalist, a follower of Monsignor Le 
Febre; and Antonio Patino was there before Don Samuel. 
  Elias Martinez, Bulmaro Gordillo, and Cecilio Baraibar left 
for personal reasons. Cecilio got married. Their work was in the 
seminary. 
  Otilio Lopez himself was not the vicar of Ocosingo; he 
worked 
in the Comitan area. He did not grow in his priesthood and left 
it. I know from a recent report that he belongs to PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] and works in the Chiapas 
CNC. Congratulations. 
  It is very easy to say that Don Samuel, as a punishment, is 
denying the sacraments to those who do not think like him. 
Couldn't the same thing be said here in Morelos? Because those 
who want baptism, confirmation, matrimony, first communion, and 
the coming-out celebration at age 15 have to attend a series of 
talks on the sacraments by the catechizers. Otherwise, they are 
not accepted. We should keep in mind that the bishop of this 
diocese is Monsignor Luis Reynoso, who is not like Don Samuel 
and presumably opposes his pastoral activity. 
  I must emphasize that Don Samuel's pastoral activity can be 
none other than the gospel of Jesus, who was born and lived 
among, supported, helped, and opted for the poor right up to 
Calvary. 
  I congratulate Don Samuel, of whom I think highly and with 
whom I was very pleased to work, and my colleagues in the 
diocese, many of whom I no longer know, for their resolute 
devotion to our Indian brothers. I would have liked to be with 
them during the events in early 1994. 
  Yours truly, Oscar Macias

<F P=106> [Text of pastoral letter "In this time of Grace, on the </F>
Occasion of the Greeting of His Holiness John Paul II to the 
Indians of the Continent," by Msgr. Samuel Ruiz Garcia, bishop 
of San Cristobal de las Casas, 6 August 1993. In a Christmas 
message (the text of which was published in Mexico City 
DOCUMENTACION E INFORMACION CATOLICA of 13 Dec 93), Bishop Ruiz 
said of his August letter that it was apparently "the last 
straw, the act that unleashed the pent-up rage of those in power 
who live from exploitation of the lowly."] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Greeting </H5>
  In this hour of grace for the Church of Latin America, as 
the 
Good News calls us together once more in the sign of unity, and 
as the Holy Father returns to Mexican soil, the land of a 
markedly prophetic mission, what better occasion to express in 
unison with the universal Church the hopes, yearnings, and 
sufferings of our Indian peoples. The Roman Pontiff John Paul II 
wishes to keep his promise and make his voice of comfort and 
enlightenment heard to Indian representatives from all over the 
continent as part of the international year of indigenous 
peoples. Our diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas, which is 
markedly Indian, wants to make its voice heard as well. 
  This new experience of Church unity and universality once 
again presents Jesus to us as the Good News that greets all 
those whose poverty places them at the fringes of society. 
Heralding this News at the start of his ministry, Jesus 
proclaims that he has been sent to proclaim the Good News to the 
poor and to all the victims of rejection and scorn (Luke 4:18). 
Aware of their needs, Jesus tells them: "Blessed are the 
poor...." (Luke 6:20). "So then, the needy and the sinners can 
feel loved by God and the object of his immense tenderness" 
(Document of Santo Domingo No. 4). 
  With this outlook of understanding and faithful to the 
Gospel 
and to the cause of the Kingdom, we wish to express the joys and 
sorrows of our local Church's journey, as well as the bountiful 
harvest of the seeds of actions and commitments that we have 
pursued out of loyalty to Jesus and the Church. We would feel 
selfish if at this moment we failed to share what God has 
brought to fruition in our midst, to console and edify the 
Church community to which we are so beholden. 
<H5>  2. The Need and Demands of a Word From the Faith </H5>
  If we know that God speaks to us through the outcries and 
even through the painful silence of those who do not yet have a 
voice and who at times live in despair, we must be able to 
discern the seven "signs of the times" and diligently respond to 
the clamor of the poor, the oppressed, the underprivileged, the 
tortured, and all those who suffer persecution owing to their 
race, religion, or denunciation of injustice. 
  "The joys and hopes, the sadness and anguish of men in our 
times, especially the poor and the suffering, are the joys and 
hopes, the sadness and anguish of the disciples of Christ. There 
is nothing truly human that does not awaken an echo in his 
Heart" (Gaudium et Spes 1). 
  The Diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas, in keeping with 
the statements of Vatican II, feels a solidarity with the 
history of our Indian brethren. Heir to the prophetic vocation 
of Fray Bartolome de las Casas, it walks among and with the 
poor, gaining an awareness of the suffering of the majority of 
the population: high rates of poverty, disease, illiteracy, lack 
of communications, deep-seated racial ostracism and 
discrimination...Let us hear their burning word.... 
<H5>  3. The Word of Our People </H5>
  "We are in a very difficult situation and time, in a 
political, economic, social, and ideological sense alike. We 
must talk about the current economic system because our way of 
life and production are oppressing us. We can see that in these 
new times those who accumulate wealth need two main things to 
keep going and make profits: the privatizations and the Free 
Trade Agreement. Capitalism needs these two things to continue 
benefiting the strong, the powerful, both here and abroad. The 
advances of technology push them in this direction for their own 
benefit. This new approach to work abandons thousands of 
peasants and workers to their fate. 
  "Given unemployment and the shortage of land, the government 
is pursuing political control because the poverty that the 
depredations of this social system creates is a threat to its 
policies. Thus, laws have to be amended and new crimes invented. 
This approach violates human rights. We can thus see that the 
system under which we live inherently violates human rights. 
  "So then, we are facing very serious and distressing 
problems...But when we tell each other of our suffering and our 
shame, then we hear the Word of God and feel that the suffering 
and afflictions of Christ are alive in us and that his Way of 
the Cross is being lived today in our municipalities. It would 
seem as though we are never going to see the end of this Calvary 
or that our problems are never going to end.... 
  "It seems that we are not going to have a resurrection...But 
whereas Jesus spent three days in the ground, we do not know how 
long our problems are going to be with us...But we are certain 
that we are going to be resurrected." 
<H5>  3.1 Economics </H5>
  People are increasingly feeling the weight of high prices, 
unemployment, injustice, and mounting poverty. The People are 
dissatisfied. There is malnutrition and poverty-caused disease. 
  We have no land on which to work and grow our food. We have 
to rent land, which takes away our profits. Our requests for 
land go unanswered, and the land is too expensive to buy. 
Meanwhile, some have a great deal of land and do not work it or 
use it to raise livestock, which requires large areas. When we 
seek to register a little plot, they charge us heavily, and if 
we get behind in our payments, they threaten to take our land. 
Oil wells are also being drilled; they belong to the government 
but adversely affect us because they take land from us. 
  The prices for what we sell are low, and we peasants need to 
transport our products ourselves, because the greedy profiteers 
and middlemen are using marketing schemes to rob us in selling 
them. 
  Wages are very low; families cannot live on them. Many 
workers and peasants who request higher wages through the 
regular established channels see that the decision almost always 
goes in the companies' favor. We thus have no one to assert our 
rights. The government boards help those who have money at the 
expense of the workers. 
  The government forces us to produce what suits it and would 
have us believe that "the efforts of all will resolve the 
crisis." The taxes on electricity and land are very high and 
rise every year. Bank loans are unaffordable, and we sink into 
debt, while private loans carry very high interest rates. The 
system is stripping the region of its natural resources, without 
development for all. 
  The forestry law is causing problems; people are being 
jailed 
under it. We are suffering greatly in the communities. We must 
file a request to cut down a tree. We have to pay to cut it 
down. If we do not pay, we have to perform 10 days' service in 
the tree nurseries. 
  The powerful, the well-off, and the tavern keepers are 
bleeding us dry. 
<H5>  3.2 Politics </H5>
  The authorities almost do not allow us to voice our 
opinions. 
We are being humiliated and deceived. 
  In elections we are forced to vote for the ruling party: PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party]. When we elect our own 
authorities, the people on top do not like them and put in their 
own. They should put one of our own in the municipal government 
to help us. It would be a good idea to train our own people to 
hold posts in the municipal government and help us resolve our 
complaints. 
  The authorities do not like to see us organizing and want to 
get rid of the people who head up a group. 
  There is repression in the countryside and the city. They 
repress us by taking our lands. They sic the police and the army 
on us and investigate us. 
  There is widespread corruption among the authorities. The 
courts are there to serve money and the dominant political 
ideology. 
<H5>  3.3 Society </H5>
  Besides widespread illiteracy, the school system is very 
deficient because teachers are irresponsible, impose new demands 
on us (holidays, godparents, uniforms), destroy our culture, 
conduct registrations at the wrong time and with many 
requirements, thus costing us time and money. Oversight by the 
educational authorities is lacking. But it seems that this is 
part of the system, because keeping people ignorant suits the 
government. 
  We do not have electricity, drinking water, or sewers in the 
countryside. Such health-care services as there are impose 
programs to introduce artificial birth control or to promote the 
abortion law. 
  Alcoholism is deeply rooted in our communities. It is a sign 
of our frustration and causes divisions, family breakups, 
confrontations, and death. 
  Many brothers and sisters who have not signed up at the 
registry office are forced to do so. They come from very far 
away to register but are asked to meet many requirements and 
thus waste much time and money. 
  The government demands that a community defray 70 percent of 
the cost of building a highway to it, besides furnishing good 
meals for the workers. 
  Women are very underprivileged and suffer greatly because 
they are the main victims of alcoholism, our worst enemy, which 
we have not been able to uproot. 
<H5>  3.4 Ideology </H5>
  There is complacency owing to the influence of others whose 
ideas dominate us. Those who leave to look for work because the 
land does not suffice return with new ideas and are no longer in 
tune with the community. 
  The government sets up cooperatives that do not educate. The 
radio lies instead of informing properly. They advertise items 
that we cannot afford and do not need, while making us believe 
that we can afford them and that their use or consumption will 
make us happy (Assembly of the Believer People, May 1993). 
  This is what a great many of our people think. 
<H5>  4. The Explanation in the Context of Our Own History </H5>
  Our people's current impoverished situation and deplorable 
living conditions, which are even worse in the Indian zones of 
our diocese, can be explained by the action of institutions that 
have developed over 500 years of our history. 
<H5>  4.1 The Conquest </H5>
  For the Indian pueblos the conquest meant subjugation and 
exploitation by the colonizers; such subjugation and 
exploitation took several different forms, depending on external 
interests and local protests against the brutality that was 
inflicted on the indigenous peoples and the trampling of their 
dignity. 
  Slavery gave way to the "encomienda" [land and inhabitants 
granted to a conquistador], which in turn gave way to the 
parceling out of Indian pueblos, at the same time that the tax 
system was stabilizing. Amid this onslaught only a few peoples 
were able to keep possession of their lands under normal 
conditions, even in the areas of sanctuary. 
<H5>  4.2 Independent Mexico </H5>
  The ups and downs of National Independence and, later, the 
first modernization with the reform and industrialization 
promoted by Porfirio Diaz led to the growth and development of 
the Mexican hacienda, with its patterns of forced labor 
differing from region to region. 
  With the haciendas came the predominance of the system of 
"permanently resident rural estate peons," uncultivated lands, 
and servants. These trends led to a greater concentration of 
land in private hands and to a decline in the lands owned and 
controlled by the Indian pueblos. These were the days of the 
sinister stories about the operations to extract chicle and 
fancy woods from the tropical jungle or the factories that 
produced sugar and spirits in more humid regions. 
<H5>  4.3 The Mexican Revolution and the Agrarian Reform </H5>
  The faction that triumphed in the Mexican Revolution sought 
to change the institutions of land tenure with its agrarian 
reform proposal aimed at quieting the demands and rebellions of 
the peasants. This was the reason for the various regulations 
governing small-scale property, whereby communal assets were 
restored and deeded and large haciendas were redistributed in 
the form of the ejidos and the new ejido population centers. The 
uneven pace and scope of these measures are well documented, 
aside from their complex, stormy history. 
  The agrarian reform had a shining moment in Chiapas under 
Lazaro Cardenas, when the first ejidos were established and 
deeds were issued for the first communal assets. During 
subsequent periods this process slowed and failed to keep pace 
with the rest of the country. We saw peonage systems in Indian 
regions of Chiapas as late as the 1980's. In contrast, products 
such as coffee, cacao, tobacco, and bananas were being exported 
from modern plantations, and areas of forest and jungle were 
being opened up and cleared for extensive ranching and grazing. 
<H5>  4.4 The Neoliberal Agenda of Modernization </H5>
  We call it this because starting with the years of so-called 
"stabilizing development" in our country (the 1950's) and more 
emphatically since the 1970's, Chiapas began to be viewed as a 
strategic region in economic and national security terms. 
Chiapas is a border state near Central America possessed of 
significant resources that could bring in foreign exchange: 
hydroelectric power, oil deposits, and the tourism appeal of 
natural beauty, shot through with Mayan history. 
  The crisis of the industrialized countries and the fall in 
oil prices in the first half of the 1980's made the burden of 
the foreign debt intolerable for the economic system. The State 
then took its first neoliberal macroeconomic austerity measures, 
which carried a high price for the most vulnerable strata and 
classes. The government of President Salinas intensified and 
honed these measures to modernize and reform the structure of 
the economy and the State, retaining control of the more 
strictly political concessions and seeking a new way to 
incorporate the Mexican economy into the international system, 
relying on the Free Trade Agreement with the United States and 
Canada as the touchstone of this effort. It managed the social 
problems arising from the expanding areas of poverty and extreme 
poverty by making discretionary use of its contingency funds 
(the result of a leaner public sector) through PRONASOL 
[National Solidarity Program], the operative arm of so-called 
"Social Liberalism." 
  From this perspective, we are now living in what we could 
call "the second modernization of the countryside in Chiapas." 
It is taking place amid a protracted drop in world coffee 
prices, precisely when agrarian conflicts are intensifying and 
spreading, in accordance with the criteria of previous agrarian 
legislation (Chiapas accounts for 27 percent of the nation's 
backward agrarian sector). The spearhead of this agrarian 
modernization movement is the reforms of Article 27 of the 
constitution and the new agrarian law. The goal is typically 
"modern": to remove obstacles so that land can be turned into 
merchandise and, thus, private investors can buy it up or form 
joint investment ventures. 
  The consequences that are actually in the offing are the 
destruction of the land's meaning to the community, the 
concentration of ownership, and migration from the countryside 
to the cities, particularly as a result of the program to 
certify ejido rights (ProCeDe), a legal requirement for the 
purchase and sale of ejido lands. 
<H5>  5. The Burden of Recent Decades: Salient Problems </H5>
<H5>  5.1 High Degree of Unrest </H5>
  Given this wide-ranging panorama of asymmetry and 
inequality, 
it is no surprise that recent decades in our diocese have been 
marked by an extremely high level of unrest. In the indigenous 
zones the most vulnerable groups in this structural framework 
have been establishing their own organizations and methods of 
struggle to demand their rights to land and better living 
conditions. It has not been an easy road; rather, it has been 
marked by violent responses from those who benefit from the 
status quo. Nonetheless, the difficulties themselves have forced 
the Indian pueblos to mobilize against hunger, exploitation, and 
repression in various ways: marches, sit-ins, demonstrations, 
hunger strikes, etc. 
<H5>  5.2 Guatemalan Refugees </H5>
  Moreover, the sociopolitical conflicts in Guatemala and the 
response of the Guatemalan State and military have also forced 
the peoples and communities ravaged by the military's "scorched 
earth" policy to flee into our country and seek refuge in 
Mexican communities along the border, which have responded with 
solidarity and like good Christians, along with other national 
and international organizations. Today, more than a decade has 
passed, and there are hopeful signs that they will be able to 
return. For example, in early January we and the Believer People 
of the Diocese watched as some 2,500 of our Guatemalan refugee 
brothers made an organized return to their country. 
<H5>  5.3 The Expulsions </H5>
  Since the 1970's we have also had to confront the painful 
problem of Indians who have been expelled as individuals and in 
groups from their municipalities and communities. Both our 
Evangelical and Catholic brothers have been victims. This 
development has forced us to spotlight freedom of religion and 
to expose the political and economic interests of the cacique 
government structures, which are given to intolerance and deals 
with the State. This situation has also required an ecumenical 
dialogue at various levels and has prompted our offer of 
humanitarian aid and counsel in defense of the human rights of 
the affected groups, families, and individuals. 
  What we find truly extraordinary is the testimony of many 
families that have been expelled, Catholic and Evangelical 
alike, who have preferred to be stripped of their homes, lands, 
and domestic animals rather than renounce their faith. Those who 
have signed some document asserting that they have changed 
religions to avoid being expelled can be counted on the fingers 
of one hand. 
  Regardless of their religious differences, the people who 
have been expelled have organized movements to defend their 
rights and have achieved significant results. 
<H5>  5.4 Discrimination and Inequality </H5>
  Although the State that emerged from the Mexican Revolution 
has tended to present itself as the guarantor of a "nationalist" 
identity into which an indigenous component has been 
incorporated, racism and discrimination are still rampant in 
these regions. Although there have been official and 
semiofficial attempts to reduce all forms of poverty, when we 
examine their results, we see that the structures of inequality 
of the socioeconomic system itself have outweighed them. 
Discrimination can be seen in all forms of poverty and in the 
predominance of political control to counter organized 
expressions of protest or dissent that pose just demands. 
  But this blight is most obvious in the administration of 
justice and respect for human rights. Our diocese's records in 
recent years contain a frightening number of reports of trumped 
up charges, unlawful arrests, torture, impunity, unjust 
imprisonments, mistreatment in prison, evictions, etc. 
  Therefore, it is not subjective to argue that all human and 
social relationships in Chiapas are shot through with inequality 
and tinged with oppression and domination, which become part of 
the collective consciousness. More than elsewhere in the 
country, the identity of men and women from Chiapas reflects 
this situation in many ways. The clearest differences can be 
seen in the case of the Indians, not only because of their race 
but also their economic and social status. Stripped of their 
lands, the Indians are strangers in their own land. This state 
of affairs is repeated among the natives who live on the fringes 
of national society and whose lands are being settled, with all 
of the consequences thereof: expropriation of their lands, the 
pillaging of their natural habitats, and the loss of their 
culture. In the cities the differences are just as great, albeit 
less apparent. The way people deal with each other makes these 
inequalities clear, and they become heightened in times of 
social conflict. These differences have become internalized and 
are reflected in the role that each is called upon to play in 
society. The poor in Chiapas are the Indians, the peasants, the 
workers, the sick, the mestizos, the children, the women, those 
who do not have influential friends, the expelled, the jobless, 
and the low-income earners. 
<H5>  5.5 The 1994 Political Transition </H5>
  In recent weeks our country has been engulfed in a series of 
very worrisome violent events. These developments have revealed 
that drug trafficking is linked to police, judicial, and 
political institutions. Regrettably, the official version of the 
death of our brother, Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, has 
succeeded only in underscoring the people's widespread mistrust 
of government institutions. In the midst of the 1994 political 
transition, this has been compounded by the scant credibility of 
electoral processes and mechanisms, which are tainted by the 
control that the State and its party have over them. In this 
specific regard, many have pointed out that as long as this 
situation persists, the democratization of our political system 
will remain an unfulfilled wish. There are serious fears that if 
this barrier remains, it will lead to confrontations and strains 
among political players outside the institutional rules and 
accords. The present moment is marked both by signs of a 
relative opening and by the resurgence of political demands that 
have long gone unmet. 
<H5>  5.6 Injustices and the Response of the Diocese </H5>
  As part of our Christian commitment to the Indians and 
peasants of the southern Pacific region, we have been pointing 
out the grave situation and the subhuman conditions in which our 
brothers are living. This situation has been worsening because 
our system has created new forms of political exploitation and 
legal injustice that legitimize oppression and repression. 
Cultures are under ideological assault and being stripped of 
their fundamental values. The list of injustices done to the 
indigenous people in our diocese over the past 500 years is a 
very long one. 
  In light of the challenges posed by modern life and the 
harshness of neoliberalism, both they and we alongside them have 
seen that poverty is in and of itself an evil that is totally 
contrary to God's will. 
  The Church has been able to fulfill its prophetic mission at 
various times through prominent figures and works. It cannot be 
denied, however, that at other times it has grown worldly, 
whether by ideologically legitimizing the organs of colonial 
government or the independent State or by enjoying privileges 
when it used the tools of the prevailing systems to gain 
property and power. 
  This local Church, which is marked mainly by Fray Bartolome 
de las Casas's evangelical loyalty, has chosen in recent decades 
to take its place on the fringes of society alongside the very 
poor. 
  In other words, the former Diocese of Chiapas, whose first 
bishop was Fray Bartolome de las Casas, a steadfast defender of 
the Indians and implacable critic of the colonial system, has 
been characterized by its pastoral line because the dreadful 
conditions that he fought against are still present. 
Particularly after the Second Vatican Council, the presence of 
pastoral agents from the diocese (priests, brothers, and 
committed laymen) in a situation of unrest set us on a long path 
that has also meant a long process of conversion. The indigenous 
community, which makes up the majority of the population and is 
the most disadvantaged segment of society, required that we make 
our presence felt urgently (if we wanted to remain faithful to 
the Gospel). This is why our diocese bears the characteristics 
inherent to pastoral action among the Indians. By such pastoral 
action we do not mean just concern for the natives; rather, it 
is an embodiment of our presence in their world, which is full 
of both shortcomings and grand values. We see it as an 
experience that guides our reflections about our faith, our 
pastoral activities, and our aspiration as a Church to move 
towards the emergence of an Autochthonous Church that will be 
able to tell of its salvific history, express itself in their 
culture, enrich itself with their values, embrace their 
sufferings, struggles, and aspirations, and through the strength 
of the Gospel transform and liberate their culture. As one 
Indian man said years ago to the apostolic delegate at the time: 
"Unless the Church becomes Tzeltal with the Tzeltal Indians, 
Chol with the Chol Indians, and Tojolabal with the Tojolabal 
Indians...I do not see how it can call itself the Catholic 
Church." It would actually be an upstart Church belonging to a 
ruling social class, alien to the Indians. The religious 
schizophrenia that Indians have experienced since the war of 
conquest will not disappear until they are acculturated in the 
Gospel in a way that bears fruit in their own ministers, in a 
faith that is reflected in their own cultural ways, and in the 
celebration of the Sacraments with their own ethnic expressions 
(Ad Gentes 6). 
  With this pastoral option our "...Church through its 
children 
joins with men of any status, but especially the poor and the 
afflicted, and devotes itself joyfully to them. It shares in 
their joys and sorrows, comes to know the aspirations and 
enigmas of life, and suffers with them in their death throes" 
(Ad Gentes 12. Cf: Ad Gentes 11 2). 
  This option has brought harassment and attacks, both by the 
State and by various privileged groups or sectors, in the 
economic and sociocultural spheres. We have thus had to endure 
slanderous propaganda and lies over the official and 
semiofficial mass media, intimidation, the jailing of pastoral 
agents, the murder of catechizers, and even inter-Church 
denunciations, with guileless people manipulated and deceived. 
  In short, the so-called discovery of America conditioned the 
life and integration of the New Continent and changed the 
history of our peoples; it also changed the life of the peoples 
who looked at us with eyes of destructive, dominating greed and 
the life of those who looked upon us with apostolic zeal to 
convey to us their experience of faith and set us on a new path. 
  The full benefits of the call to Christ's faith to form a 
Church, which summons peoples like a light raised on high, are 
better understood after 500 years and ought to be duly 
appreciated. Therefore, our Roman Pontiff, Pope John Paul II, 
put forth the idea of nine years of renewed evangelization to 
commemorate the 500th anniversary of the meeting of the two 
worlds, inasmuch as the birth of what we today call Latin 
America was closely linked to the proclamation of the Gospel's 
message in our lands. And although it is true that the 
evangelization was at times also used as a tool for subjecting 
peoples to an unjust colonization and its resulting 
depredations, "it must also be recognized that...it has been 
much more powerful than the shadows that regrettably accompanied 
it down through history." 
<H5>  6. The Diocesan Pastoral Process (1960-1993) </H5>
<H5>  6.1.1 Interpreters and Confidants of the People </H5>
  As interpreters and confidants of the people, we realize how 
difficult it is to open the door to hope when the conditions 
under which most people live are so distressing and the 
structures of domination are so persistent that those who devote 
their lives to change see that all of creation is misused by the 
evil of the wicked. Those who seek the paths of justice become 
so upset and frustrated at times that they do not know what to 
do and not even what to ask for. But we know that the Spirit 
wails within us with indescribable sobs that the Father can, 
however, understand, as the Spirit intercedes with Him on our 
behalf (Romans 8:18-27). 
  It is precisely now that words of encouragement are most 
needed, words that are both specific and that explain why 
Christians have hope. Today we wish to support all that we have 
done and said on its sole, true foundation: the Resurrection. 
The process of the diocesan Church that began 33 years ago has 
the Lord's Resurrection as its source, because if Christ did not 
rise again, our pastoral work and your faith are in vain. The 
message of the Resurrection is, in fact, the core that has given 
us hope through the various stages, because the Resurrection is 
the central mystery of the faith, and the faith has given us the 
inspiration for everything that we have done. 
<H5>  6.1.2 Evangelizing </H5>
  "To evangelize is to do what Jesus Christ did when in the 
synagogue he showed that he had come to `evangelize' the poor 
(Luke 4:18-19). Being rich, he became poor to enrich us with his 
poverty (2 Corinthians 8,9). He challenges us to bear genuine 
witness to evangelical poverty in our lifestyle and Church 
structures, as He did. This is the foundation of our commitment 
to an evangelical and preferential option for the poor, an 
option that is steadfast and irrevocable but neither exclusive 
nor exclusionary, as solemnly affirmed at the Medellin and 
Puebla conferences" (Santo Domingo No. 178, 1-3). 
<H5>  6.1.3 The Suffering of Our People Is the Starting Point </H5>
  The suffering of our people is the starting point of a 
lengthy journey, of a transforming process of conversion, of a 
pressing appeal for us to serve as salvific mediators for the 
indigenous world (the poor among the poor), an appeal that 
awaits an evangelical reply without delay. 
<H5>  6.2 Several Stages in What We Call the Diocesan Process Can </H5>
Be Distinguished 
<H5>  6.2.1 The Stage of Pastoral Renewal </H5>
  The stage of pastoral renewal began after the Second Vatican 
Council and was supported by the joint pastoral of the UMAE 
(Union of Mutual Episcopal Aid), in which 25 dioceses took part. 
This stage sought to develop a Joint Pastoral through planning 
with the aid of Religious Sociology and with the encouragement 
of the Movement for a Better World. Several ecclesiastical 
organizations in Mexico became enthusiastic about the idea and 
the earnestness with which the movement was set in motion, in 
light of the backing that Padre Lombardo, S.J. and the father of 
Religious Sociology himself, Canon Boulard, gave to this 
movement. Many community leaders who were called upon at the 
time remain active to this day. 
  Work in teams, divided up by homogeneous zones, was 
organized 
in the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas. This teamwork 
continues today, with some modifications. Taking part with us in 
this undertaking in the southern Pacific coast region were 
Guatemalan bishops from neighboring dioceses, who were united in 
their desire to move forward together in the indigenous 
pastoral. The disastrous Guatemalan earthquake interrupted the 
meetings that we had been holding with them. 
  The process that UMAE had set in motion was taken up by the 
Bishops Conference itself when it asked the services team which 
had been set up to advise the Mexican Episcopate. 
<H5>  6.2.2 The Stage of Pastoral Reaffirmation </H5>
  The stage of reaffirming the value of indigenous cultures, 
in 
order to develop a pastoral geared to the various situations of 
these ethnic groups, began after the Gatherings of Indigenous 
Missions in Mexico and the Pastoral Gathering of Missions in 
Melgar, Colombia, which was organized by the Missions Department 
of CELAM [Latin American Bishops Conference] in preparation for 
the Medellin meeting. The shared approaches and experiences that 
furthered an understanding of missionary work date from my term 
as president of the CELAM Missions Department and of the 
Episcopal Commission for Indians in Mexico. We thus moved 
gradually from the "pro-Indian pastoral" (run by agents alien to 
the Indian communities) to an indigenous pastoral (run by people 
in charge of the communities themselves). 
<H5>  6.2.3 The Stage of Grasping the Sociopolitical Dimension </H5>
  This stage was marked by the political liberalization of the 
country, when political movements could be acknowledged as 
partisan movements that were able to run in elections. We 
bishops of the southern Pacific coast region (Province of 
Antequera or Oaxaca) issued a joint Pastoral Document to guide 
the faithful in the region. Although it was not our intention, 
the document had a major domestic and even international impact. 
  Political parties that had theretofore not been registered 
or 
officially recognized went into every corner of the republic to 
sign up the affiliates they needed to register. Our region saw a 
heavy influx of political movements and parties, which made 
their presence effectively felt despite linguistic, ethnic, and 
geographic barriers. The aforementioned Pastoral Letter had been 
both timely and prophetic, and besides being very useful, it 
still offers guidance in most respects. 
  This stage included our diocese's inescapable commitment to 
join in the Indians' struggles to recover their lands and in the 
criticism of the euphoria surrounding the "oil miracle" that 
brutalized Indians, created tension and conflict, prompted a 
campaign to discredit us, and brought repression of Indian 
leaders and the pastoral agents who stood by them in their 
efforts and struggles to defend their cultural identity, their 
patrimony, and their survival. 
<H5>  6.2.4 The Stage of the Economic and Social Processes of </H5>
Neoliberal Modernity 
  Neoliberal Modernity, with its economic and social 
processes, 
does not take the diversity of peoples into account. It seems 
that modernity would like to eliminate them, as if they were a 
hindrance rather than a human resource. One of the urgent 
responsibilities of the new evangelization is to establish the 
autochthonous Church, which has emerged from the historic trends 
in society, culture, religion, and the faith. 
  Our great motivation in this process is the appeal for love 
and service that Christ makes to us from the suffering people 
with whom he identifies. We acknowledge that our path is in our 
faith, in the heart of our Church, the Church that 
notwithstanding its tensions and limitations and even the human 
failings of many of its members, is able to respond to the 
Spirit that guides it through historic crossroads such as the 
Vatican Council, Medellin, Puebla, and Santo Domingo. At no 
point have we lapsed into a spiritualist reductionism (which 
shuns history) or a sociological reductionism that fails to 
affirm our transcendence. 
<H5>  6.3 Three Elements That Have Accompanied Us on Our Journey </H5>
  In the beginning we saw these three aspects as parallel. 
Over 
time, however, our pastoral activities brought them together, 
until we viewed them as a basic unit that has accompanied us on 
our diocesan journey. 
<H5>  6.3.1 Incarnation </H5>
  Our Church can be truly Catholic only to the extent that it 
becomes "whole for all" and is able to proclaim salvation from 
the very essence of mankind in its specific forms, our cultures. 
It must invigorate, purify, and enlighten them, placing the 
gifts that God has given humanity in the context of the faith 
with an eye towards the building of the Kingdom that will become 
part of history and seek eagerly to undertake the divine 
project, which has been planted in the hearts of men and which 
will reach its fullness in the Second Coming. 
<H5>  6.3.2 Liberation </H5>
  We have discovered that redemption through Christ is a 
comprehensive redemption accomplished inchoately in history or 
with the involvement of mankind. This discovery was not the 
result of abstract reflection; it was the result of living 
together with our people and seeing their poverty, their 
suffering, and the injustice of which they are victims. We hear 
the urgent appeal for us to become a credible Church that 
proclaims the Good News to the poor. 
<H5>  6.3.3 Service to the World </H5>
  We know that the Church is not an end in itself, nor is it 
built for itself. We know that it has been sent into the world 
as its servant and as a humble but necessary leavening for the 
construction of the Kingdom of God, which is justice, love, and 
peace. We also know that the Kingdom begins here, although its 
consummation is not of this world. This spurs us on, in the here 
and now, to perform our evangelical task of learning how to talk 
with all those of good will, to shed evangelical light on the 
times, and to walk with all our brothers. 
<H5>  6.4 The Most Important Moments of the Diocesan Process </H5>
<H5>  6.4.1 The Indian Congress </H5>
  In 1974 the diocese was invited to take part in an Indian 
Congress from 14 to 16 October in the city of San Cristobal de 
las Casas to honor the feast of Fray Bartolome de las Casas, the 
"defender of the Indians." In accepting, the diocese was trying 
merely to enable the Indians to make their voice heard in public 
after so many years of silence. The Indians astutely seized the 
opportunity and accepted the challenge of taking responsibility 
for the Congress and putting the seal of their own personality 
on it. A thousand communities representing 400,000 persons took 
part for one year, during which time they gathered together the 
complaints and problems of the four linguistic zones (Chol, 
Tzeltal, Tzotzil, and Tojolabal) in the areas of land, trade, 
education, and health care. 
  Representatives who were "men of their word" were elected at 
these assemblies, that is to say, individuals who are consistent 
in "what they do and say" and who would put their proposals 
before their Indian brothers in attendance. 
  During the three-day Congress they described in detail the 
desperate conditions in which they lived, giving specific 
examples of their plight: abuse in stores, exploitation on the 
job, eviction from their lands, destruction of their culture, 
oppression, murders that go unpunished, etc. Their denunciations 
were analytical, with painful, undeniable information as to 
dates, places, persons, and events. They offered suggestions as 
to how justice could be served and put forth an organized plan 
of action. They asked the Church (which they know is not a 
political party or a political alternative but does have social 
power) to lend them its support and its prophetic voice, as the 
Lord, incarnate in Yahweh's poor, asks of it. 
  When we as pastoral agents of the diocese heard and saw what 
the Indians were saying about their own situation, we realized 
very clearly that we had drafted our Pastoral Plan without 
taking into account the aspirations, needs, and hopes of their 
communities. In answer to their appeal, we drew up a plan that 
sought to respond in some way, based on the faith, to the needs 
they described. 
<H5>  6.4.2 Preferential Option for the Poor </H5>
  The panorama of impoverished, disadvantaged conditions that 
we see in Latin America is strongly prevalent in our diocese. 
With a great sense of responsibility and fidelity to the Gospel 
we recall the pastoral letter of 17 October 1985, which on 
behalf of the Christians in the diocese denounced the injustices 
that the people are constantly suffering. 
  It is with deep sorrow and concern that we have seen in 
Chiapas the increasing number of attempted murders, the abuse of 
the most basic human rights, and the crackdown on grass-roots 
movements. As a diocesan Church, we strive to be faithful to our 
vocation to build the Kingdom of God by advancing evangelical 
values to humanize the earth and by serving primarily the poor. 
We cannot remain uninvolved in what is happening in our midst. 
Events cause us to exclaim: "Yahweh has seen the miserable state 
of my people in Egypt and has heard the appeal to be free of 
their slave drivers. I am well aware of their sufferings" 
(Exodus 3:7). 
  Aware of the painful conditions facing our brothers, the 
poorest of the poor, we chose to accompany them, like the good 
Samaritan, in their quest for a new society based on justice and 
brotherhood. 
  The evangelizing task of Jesus himself is marked by a 
commitment to the poor. He undertook his messianic mission as 
"the servant of Yahweh" (Isaiah 41:9; 42; 49:3-50:3). He is the 
one who is to come; there is no need to wait for another. For 
the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf 
hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is 
proclaimed to the poor (Matthew 11:2-7; Luke 4:16-22). 
  We will be able to understand the Beatitudes of Christ only 
if we avoid placing our heart in riches and only if we are 
prepared to fraternally share economic, social, and cultural 
goods with those who lack them (Luke 6:20-26). Men are blessed 
when, moved by the Spirit of God, they make common cause with 
the poor (Matthew 5:11-19). 
  In the beginning, our pastoral plans focused mainly on the 
neediest. But as we lived together with "Yahweh's poor" and 
discovered their great suffering, we were forced by 
circumstances to speak out against the way in which they were 
being plundered. Therefore, in light of evangelical reflection, 
we had to make a more clear-cut option for the poor. This was no 
decree, no mere theological rambling; it was a simple reading of 
our intentions and the trend of our pastoral activities in the 
face of painful realities. It was an urgent evangelical 
decision. We also knew that we were beginning to experience the 
conflict of charity: proclaiming from amid the poor a message of 
conversion to the oppressor and proclaiming to the oppressed, 
with whom Christ identifies, a hope-giving Gospel (Santo Domingo 
279, 178-179). In light of this diocesan option, we revised the 
training of future priests, our actions, and our attitudes, in a 
word, our entire approach. 
  The structure of our diocese has undergone changes during 
these years, not only to meet the demands of the Council but 
also as a result of contact with the communities and a 
consideration of their permanently conflict-ridden situations, 
as well as to respond to unexpected developments that demanded 
rapid analysis. 
  The theological-pastoral reflection that accompanied this 
evolution was also marked by historical junctures that were 
favorable to our diocese. Having attended all sessions of the 
Council, I was also at the Melgar missionary meeting in 
preparation for the episcopal gathering in Medellin, at which I 
also presented a paper: "Evangelization in Latin America." When 
I was asked to serve as chairman of the CELAM Missions 
Department and, later, as chairman of the Bishops Commission for 
Indians of the Mexican Bishops Conference, I gained 
opportunities to enrich the diocese's journey with the 
post-Council Latin American theological reflection on missionary 
work that was developing at the time. 
<H5>  6.4.3 The Way of Evangelization and Catechesis </H5>
<H5>  6.4.3.1 The First Stage, 1952 </H5>
  During the first stage, which began under my predecessor, 
His 
Excellency Bishop Dr. Lucio Torreblanca, Indian men and women 
stepped forward, motivated by the Spirit of the Lord, and 
gathered their brothers together. They taught hymns and 
explained certain catechistic texts with questions and answers. 
Most important was the testimony of their lives, as manifested 
in their zeal and the glow of their words. They did not have 
academic training; they did not have a legal mandate. They had 
an evangelical mandate to share the joy of having discovered a 
new life (Matthew 13:44-46). 
  In 1961, the apostolic delegate, Msgr. Luigi Raimondi, 
suggested that the Chiapas diocese establish two schools of 
catechistic training for Indians in an effort to implement the 
resolutions of the Indian Missionary Congress. During this 
period 700 catechizers from various Indian regions were trained. 
The methods were very dynamic, but Western in nature and 
organized from the top down. There was, however, this key 
element: a devotion to service in proclaiming the Good News to 
all, whatever the sacrifice. 
<H5>  6.4.3.2 The Second Stage, Starting in 1968 </H5>
  The second stage began in 1968. In assessing the catechizing 
efforts, the catechizers clearly stated: "The Church and the 
Word of God have told us about things to save our souls, but we 
do not know how to save our bodies. While we work for the 
salvation of our souls and the souls of others, we suffer 
hunger, disease, poverty, and death." These words spoke to us 
and helped us to discover that the Gospel is not just a series 
of dogmas but also a liberating proclamation and a new life. The 
Council and later Medellin spoke to us of a liberating 
proclamation that entails learning humbly how the Spirit of God 
lives and acts in the historic-salvific values and events of a 
given culture. 
  We thus intensified our reflection on and practice of a 
catechesis that we called the catechesis of incarnation, which 
sought to have the Word of God assume the flesh of a culture and 
invigorate the individual and community life of our brothers 
amid historical events. The entire life of the community, its 
social, economic, political, and cultural reality, was revealed 
to us as a theological place that, as the bishops emphasized at 
the October 1974 synod, bespoke the substance of the 
proclamation that must be made through its various components 
(the needs of the listeners, their desires, and their way of 
speaking, thinking, judging, and interacting with their fellow 
man). 
  The catechizers became spokesmen of the community's 
thinking, 
not just teachers who conveyed prefabricated thinking. The Word 
of God became reflected within the communities on the basis of 
experiences and situations, and the catechizers became "the 
gatherers of the harvest of community thought." As they 
reflected on very painful situations they had experienced, men, 
women, and children began speaking out, in keeping with the 
Indians' style, until they developed the Resolution, which 
contained their vision of the faith, their theological vision of 
reality. These resolutions were called "catechistic readings," 
and although they were not going to be taught to the community, 
they represented the outgrowth of their Christian reflection on 
their lives and problems. When they reflected on brotherly 
charity, they said: "Charity is not talked about, or defined, or 
written about; charity is lived." Their reflection consisted of 
a commitment to organize the community and live that commitment 
in man's three dimensions: How will we live our charity in 
politics? What does loving our fellow man mean in the economic 
sphere? What does it mean to love one's brother from the 
standpoint of culture? 
  Without the self-sacrificing devotion of our servants and 
catechizers, evangelization would have made scant progress in a 
diocese as large, as isolated (owing to the lack of roads), and 
as complex (given its diverse ethnic, political, and economic 
makeup) as ours. They bring the communities together, at least 
once a week, and nourish the communities' faith with their 
words, their example, and their actions. 
<H5>  6.4.4 The Oneness and Service of Authority </H5>
  The episcopal mission in the Church of God involves the 
tasks 
of teaching, sanctifying, and governing the People of God and 
seeks to consolidate the Church of the Lord so that it, as the 
light of nations, can proclaim, promote, and contribute with all 
men of "good will" to the construction of the Kingdom of God, 
which is shaped in time and consummated in eternity. 
  The efforts to fulfill this threefold episcopal mission 
throughout our diocese amid the complexity of its ethnic groups 
and historical situations do not end with the direct activities 
of the bishop himself. Pastoral agents, committed lay persons, 
catechizers, and countless servants acting jointly with him are 
active throughout the diocese. The diocese has 7,822 catechizers 
and 422 deacon candidates (called pre-deacons) in 2,608 
communities. Along with the catechizers, the Christian 
communities have developed other ministries that help build the 
People of God. Several thousand people conduct these ministries 
on a permanent basis in our diocese, their only remuneration 
being the strength that the Lord gives their hearts. 
  By the same token, one of the most important efforts that 
the 
bishop of this diocese has undertaken has been to make way for 
joint responsibility and shared decision-making in the great 
task of proclaiming the Gospel to the poor. The Diocesan 
Assemblies are an example of this. Each of them is a salvific 
moment in which our diocesan life is invigorated, guided, and 
begun anew in light of the events that reflect a love of God, as 
embodied in history and discovered through the written Word. 
  Through an ongoing conversion that means accepting the 
presence of the Spirit in the community in light of the faith, 
we become convinced that we must respect individuals and 
communities (while still addressing them critically) so that 
they can compare their behavior with the Word of God and realize 
that they themselves must forge their own history. This is all 
the more necessary because the people (especially the indigenous 
people) have had their voice in society, and even in the Church 
itself, taken away from them. We have taken the steps that we 
have because the people must become aware of their dignity as 
children of God who have been redeemed through the blood of 
Christ. We have also taken them because we need organizations to 
demand what in justice is due them. In the final accounting, we 
have taken them because the dispossessed, spurred by their 
Christian faith, must proceed towards the construction of the 
Kingdom in justice, as the privileged audience of the Gospel. 
  The Spirit of the Lord has brought forth in these 
communities 
values the seeds of which were planted throughout their history. 
The Church Fathers called them "Seeds of the Word." This lends 
acculturation in the Gospel a distinguishing feature. The 
community structure and the lifestyle of solidarity and service 
in Mayan Indian cultures are strikingly conducive to an 
acceptance of the Good News in the freshness and novelty that 
characterize the ministries. 
  The indigenous culture, along with an evangelization 
strongly 
marked by Christian commitment, are the new wine that offers 
many opportunities for work and shared responsibility in service 
to the community. Various ministries are thus emerging in the 
community, as former ministries of their own culture are renewed 
and invigorated. The most common terms referring to them are: 
"workers" and "servants," which indicate that work is truly 
being done for the community. After many years of work amid 
suffering and hope we have in our diocese: catechizers, 
secretaries, leaders, stewards, chairmen, choirs, regional 
heads, health promoters, women's coordinators, tuhuneles [not 
further identified], pre-deacons, deacons, and servants for the 
defense of human rights. 
  The communities' responsible acceptance of the Gospel fuels 
the hope that we can move towards an indigenous priesthood. 
  Since we are accompanying the people in their search for 
mature, aware, and responsible answers, we must ask the Lord 
Jesus to render our minds permanently clear so that we can 
discern before him the commitment that leads to the construction 
of the Kingdom of God in justice and truth. 
<H5>  6.5 Accomplishments and Work Methods </H5>
<H5>  6.5.1 Accomplishments </H5>
  It is difficult to recount accomplishments because several 
are the work of other institutions, bodies, or individuals that 
also have an impact on the life of the communities. 
  What we can describe as a diocesan accomplishment is the 
move 
that the Indian and peasant communities have been making away 
from having others decide for them and towards forging their own 
history. In other words, the Indians and peasants are gaining a 
growing awareness of their dignity, enhanced by the values of 
the Gospel. They have been taking the place that they deserve in 
the Church and, consequently, in history as well. Gradually they 
are feeling and living their own responsibility in the Church to 
which they belong and which belongs to them. 
  The communities have been gaining a critical awareness, 
which 
is a sign of a mature faith. They are discovering that united 
they can solve the problems besetting them. Appreciation for 
their own language, their legitimate customs, and their cultural 
identity has grown. Translators selected by the communities have 
translated the Sacred Scriptures into several Indian languages, 
with guidance from the diocese, which bears the ultimate 
responsibility. 
  They have taken joint responsibility for the cooperative and 
health-care movement. Enlightened by reflection on the Word of 
God, many communities have organized unions to improve various 
aspects of their lives: transportation, loans, health care, etc. 
<H5>  6.5.2 Work Methods </H5>
  All work methods have evolved, but one of them evolved more 
strikingly or constantly in one of the zones and from there 
spread naturally to the rest. It was a catechesis that moved 
from indoctrination ("Nopteswanej") to community involvement 
("Tijwanej"). This method involves courses either for a specific 
group, which then conveys them to its community, or for entire 
communities, which add their comments, thus enriching the 
courses for other communities. Depending on needs and timing, 
these courses address: introduction or further studies for 
catechizers; Sacred Scripture; support group members; deacon 
training; human rights; analysis of actual conditions, faith and 
politics, and health care. They are taught in the community, in 
a zone, or in a broader region. 
  Whether with the enlightenment of the faith or with support 
infrastructure, mechanisms are put in place to complement the 
processes, decisions, or actions, depending on our role: 
pilgrimages, support for a ban on alcohol, support for women's 
groups, and guidance and support in cases of human rights 
violations. On pastoral tours, during visits, and at meetings we 
accompany them in their expressions of joy: in celebrating the 
faith, at the feasts of patron saints, and at meetings with 
community representatives, whether for special issues or to 
assess, organize, or schedule gatherings. Their modest goal is 
economic or environmental alternatives so that they can discover 
their own abilities and see the results of their own actions. 
<H5>  6.5.3 Criteria </H5>
  At the root of all our pastoral guidance lies an evangelical 
principle: proclaiming and living a faith that leads to abundant 
life (John 10:10), and illuminating the link between faith and 
life. Therefore, at each step of the way we must judge whether 
an action furthers the creation of the Kingdom of God in 
Justice, in Truth, in Love, in Peace. 
  Hence, every pastoral action is legitimate if it is 
liberating, if it respects the legitimate decisions of God's 
People, if it accompanies their journey and helps the weak, if 
it takes into account their culture, religiosity, and needs. 
  Pastoral agents decide carefully when to be present so that 
they do not displace people from their proper place but instead 
help them to mature so that they themselves can decide, 
question, and evaluate, thus shaping their own history. The 
people themselves often wisely tell us where our place is. In 
the final accounting, manipulation, paternalism, and supplanting 
run counter to the Gospel. 
  It is important to acknowledge and respect people's proper 
place in their civic and political decisions. Enlightened by the 
faith, Christians do well to make their own political decisions, 
and we as pastoral agents should neither head their 
organizations nor promote our own leadership. Guidance that 
informs, enlightens, or supports whatever just actions are 
undertaken is consistent with our role. 
<H5>  6.5.4 Mistakes </H5>
  We have made many mistakes in our pastoral pilgrimage. 
  Our first actions, years before the Second Vatican Council, 
were destructive of culture. We had only our own criteria for 
judging customs, and our judgment was based on ethnocentrism and 
moralizing, which unfortunately were widespread at the time. Our 
shortcomings, our compassion and love for the Indians, and our 
presence in their midst had to suffice. 
  We were unable to see the mestizo domination of politics and 
the economy and even their manipulation of religion to 
facilitate their plundering of the Indians, who were kind and 
enthusiastically religious. Without realizing, much less 
analyzing it, we were on the side of those who oppressed the 
Indians; we felt that through them and their illusory good will 
we could bring about some changes. 
  We have not found a pedagogical method (if there is one) to 
touch the hearts of those who, while geographically close to the 
Indians and peasants, are distant from them in spirit. The many 
methods and activities we experimented with in various parts of 
the diocese have had short-lived effects. The conversion of the 
so-called "caxlan" or mestizo hinges in some cases on 
restitution, which means the departure of all of them from the 
community, inasmuch as they have improperly taken possession of 
homes and lands. We see that the hearts of more than a few 
mestizos are opening up, while others are hardening. 
  The presence of the poor and their deep grasp of the 
mysteries that God reveals to them more than to the learned 
(Luke 10:21) have caused jealousy and the feeling that they are 
being left out of a Church that they once knew and that they saw 
as a place of worship without any commitment to follow Jesus and 
without any concern for their brothers (Luke 16:19-31). 
  We have not made sufficient use of grass-roots religiosity 
to 
harness its deep, hidden sense of liberation. 
  The frequent personnel changes by religious congregations 
adversely affect the monitoring of evangelization efforts and 
teamwork. 
  The pace of events is dizzying at times, and we are often 
incapable of reacting to the consequences that they have for the 
people. The agrarian laws that were recently reformed in 
connection with the so-called Free Trade Agreement are having a 
very adverse impact on the peasant communities, but we have been 
unable to propose alternatives to them. 
<H5>  7. Our Word as a Church, Today </H5>
<H5>  7.1 The Evangelizing Mission of the Church, Sacrament of the </H5>
Father's Love 
  God wishes to restore life where death imposes its laws: "I 
have seen the oppression of my people and heard their cries" 
(Exodus 3:7). He is manifesting himself in our troubled history 
to reestablish his plan: to distribute the riches of creation 
justly (Luke 1:47-55). God reveals himself when he accompanies 
the people's liberation and forges an alliance with them: "I 
will be your God and you shall be my people" (Leviticus 26:12). 
Thus, to be against the people and their rightful aspirations is 
to be against God. Jesus became poor among the poor and from 
their midst proclaimed and fulfilled the Father's Plan amid a 
troubled history of death, and he calls on us to take the path 
of Life, strengthened by the Truth and the Hope of the 
Resurrection. 
  Therefore, in light of this situation, the Church's 
evangelizing mission (the Sacrament of the Father's Love, of 
Jesus's Solidarity, and of the summoning of the Holy Spirit) 
demands that we proclaim here and now the Good News of the 
entire world's liberation so that all men and women will pledge 
to take part in God's action in the world by acknowledging 
Christ as the Lord of Life who acts in history. 
  The plan of Salvation unfolds in a world full of options, 
which invigorate life and history. These very options define the 
Christian option, the truth of which is shown in Christ, who 
died and rose again. We can choose between eternal life and 
death, between God and the idols of power and money, between 
freedom and oppression, between living and building the 
community and plunging into individualism; between discovering 
Christ in the poor, defending them and loving them, and 
oppressing and plundering them; between building justice and 
destroying ourselves amid injustice. In a word, we can proclaim 
and build the Kingdom of the living God or build a Kingdom of 
death. Each of the options for life, by which we follow Jesus, 
increase the life within us and clarify our pilgrimage, which is 
a commitment without return. 
<H5>  7.2 Our Objective </H5>
  Our objective is that our diocesan Church, in union with the 
Universal and Latin American Church, will proclaim the life of 
Jesus and life in a participatory, fraternal community, while 
committing ourselves to and serving the people, joining like 
Jesus in the process of liberating the oppressed, who will shape 
their own history, so that together we can build the new society 
as a foretaste of the Kingdom. 
<H5>  7.3 Principles Guiding Us </H5>
<H5>  7.3.1 Theological </H5>
<H5>  7.3.1.1 God Our Father </H5>
  He is the creator of the universe. He has made his creation 
a 
gift for all men and women. But in their desire to possess more, 
human beings kill to become the sole owners of the gifts that 
God, out of love, gave to us. Thus did social sin develop. 
  God is a God of life who accompanies his people, who reveals 
himself in the suffering, resurrected Christ the poor, who opts 
for the poor, who wants life for all his children, especially 
for the most deprived and despised in our society, who wants 
well-being for the people. 
  God reveals himself to us in history; his salvific action 
takes place in history through the participation of men. 
  God makes a Covenant with his people and calls on us to be 
faithful, to free ourselves from injustice and death, to form a 
community, and to work together to build the Kingdom. 
<H5>  7.3.1.2 Jesus Christ </H5>
  The God of life appeared among us as a poor man called Jesus 
of Nazareth, who was slain by the powerful of this world because 
he did good. Jesus Christ, God become incarnate in history, took 
his place among the poor, gave them preference, and made their 
cause his. This is why Jesus Christ obliges us to seek the 
fulfillment of the human person and brings us into his project 
of life and life in abundance (=liberation). 
  What illuminates our search to build the Kingdom of God is 
the work of Jesus, his mission, marked by a commitment to the 
poor. He came to liberate all men from all the servitudes to 
which sin has subjected them (John 8:32-35): ignorance, hunger, 
poverty, oppression, and injustice, the origin of which is 
selfishness and hatred, and he proclaims the Good News to the 
poor, liberation to the captive, and freedom to the oppressed. 
<H5>  7.3.1.3 The Holy Spirit </H5>
  The Spirit of God is present in Jesus and manifests his 
strength in summoning the people for total liberation. 
  The Spirit of Jesus, as present in the ecclesiastic 
community, creates a variety of ministries in it for the 
fulfillment of its mission, embracing the cultural and 
socioeconomic conditions of peoples. 
<H5>  7.3.1.4 The Church </H5>
  It was born among the excluded of the Empire; among them it 
proclaimed and announced Jesus and the Kingdom. 
  The Church, the community of those who believe in Jesus, 
proclaims and promotes liberation from among the poor. 
  The Church, as a visible reality, is made up of the 
Hierarchy 
and of all baptized persons, who are the People of God. The 
movements that emerge from among the people through the power of 
the Spirit are the ones that have invigorated the Church. 
  In our diocese today the People of Believers want to bring 
about the Kingdom of God and are expressing this in different 
ways. 
<H5>  7.3.1.5 Mary </H5>
  The maternal face of God's action, in Mexico she manifests 
herself as a protector, defender, and evangelizer who, despite 
having many ambassadors, conducted the evangelization through a 
poor Indian, Juan Diego. 
<H5>  7.3.2 On Individuals </H5>
  Western thought focuses on possessing, having. In Latin 
American thought, the individual develops and is perceived on 
the basis of being. An individual is not something more because 
he or she owns more. 
  The task of philosophy is to open up the panorama of human 
potentialities to the presence of the other. The fulfillment of 
the human person entails a growth of the people in their 
decision-making, a respect for them without manipulation. 
  The value of human beings is pre-eminent. They all possess 
an 
inviolable dignity that must be respected in and of itself; 
others must respect it and see that it is respected without 
qualifications. 
<H5>  7.3.3 On Society </H5>
  Human coexistence in society must be based on the common 
good, which means the fraternal fulfillment of the common 
dignity; this means that some are not to be used as tools for 
the benefit of others. 
  A proper social order requires a just distribution of 
resources to thus achieve the common good. This is the priority 
concern of society and the authorities, whose function is to 
further the good of the majority and guide the humanization and 
transformation of natural resources. 
  Society is pluralistic, and therefore ethnic and cultural 
variations must be taken into account so that peoples, which 
shape their own history, can fulfill themselves. This cannot be 
done unless opportunities for participation in the economy, 
politics, and social relations are created. Peoples shape their 
own history, and society is the setting in which human existence 
achieves fullness by giving the community precedence over 
individualism. 
  There are disagreements, interests, and confrontations in 
society, as well as a confusion of ideas owing to the clash of 
cultures. 
  There are countries that are exploited by others. Among them 
are the countries of Latin America, in which large percentages 
of people are living in poverty, disadvantaged conditions, and 
misery. The economy, politics, and ideology of a country are 
determined by its place in the world: center-periphery. 
  We are a dependent country at the level of states, 
municipalities, ejidos, and communities. The break with 
dependence begins from the periphery when the disadvantaged and 
oppressed become an aware, organized people. The State does not 
allow this break because it would shatter its agenda of 
hegemony. This is why it seeks to control the people and keep 
them unaware and unorganized through political, economic, 
ideological, and police-military controls. 
<H5>  7.3.4 Ethical Demands </H5>
  In this sort of world Christians know that their priority is 
other people, those who are not secure: the weak, on whose 
behalf we must struggle for justice and become the hands of God 
in defense of their human rights (sic). 
  The comprehensive growth of individuals and a community can 
be achieved only on the basis of their own culture, so that each 
and every one shapes its own history. Neither they nor we can do 
this alone; we must do it together, because we both have values 
to contribute in the pursuit of happiness. We encourage 
involvement and the sharing of responsibilities. 
  We promote human beings in their development as complete 
persons, thus furthering their progress towards independence. 
  We must not lose our identity as Christians and pastoral 
agents, since only as such can we be forces for unity. 
<H5>  7.4 Moving Forward on the Path of Faith, Hope, and Charity </H5>
  The different response that rich and poor give to the 
proclamation of the Gospel creates divisions and contradictions 
in mankind's house (Luke 12:51) and prompts serious opposition 
to those who proclaim love and justice. We can only deplore the 
fact that the Lord Jesus's reproaches of the Scribes and 
Pharisees (Luke 11:37, 12:1) are still fully valid in our 
diocese. The poor who demand their rights through legal channels 
are repressed; merchants profiteer with agricultural products; 
jails are full of innocent people; and hunger and malnutrition 
are the permanent companions of many Indians. 
  In the face of this situation, which is very common in Latin 
America, our diocese is compelled to intensify its prophetic 
mission by interpreting the "signs of the times" in light of the 
Spirit and by calling for the sort of conversion that will lead 
all to build a just society. This interpretation of history is 
part of the service that the Church performs in the world and 
falls within its prophetic ministry, which proclaims God's 
justice. 
  Moving forward today on the path of faith, hope, and charity 
in the Universal and Latin American Church means continuing to 
preach the Word of God amid conditions in which poverty has 
spread and grown worse, in which tensions have sharpened, and in 
which men and women have become aware of their actual situation. 
Their actual situation is more troubled because the powerful 
have strengthened their hand through the use of force and have 
turned a deaf ear to the Gospel, while materialism has taken 
hold of the modern, industrialized, secularized ruling classes. 
But on a continent on which the Catholic Church consists largely 
of the poor, oppressed masses that have been deprived of power, 
these masses are full of faith, solidarity, and hope for a 
better future that will enable them to march towards a new 
world, a forerunner of the Kingdom of Life that will be achieved 
with Christ in final salvation. 
  "The resurrection of Christ, which reaffirms his entire 
mission, reaffirms the hope of man's resurrection in history, a 
Resurrection that predates and leads to the final resurrection. 
Mankind throughout the ages is invited as part of this 
resurrection to reconcile social groups and classes and to 
restore the order of nature that has been violated, subjugated, 
and distorted. From Christ's resurrection stems the effective, 
persevering effort to begin and consolidate processes that are 
designed to build the sort of life that is not limited to an 
adequate daily diet but instead entails a recognition of 
so-called human rights and the reestablishment of a human 
community whose institutions function for man, not for 
accumulation" (Easter 1993 Message). 
<H5>  8. An Appeal for Understanding, Dialogue, and Conversion </H5>
  At a time when contradictions are sharpening in our country 
and troubled waters are developing in which many are fishing for 
and finding juicy profits, the responsibility of Christians in 
the quest for truth must emerge more clearly. By striving to 
internalize in our own hearts the suffering or anguish of 
others, we will be better prepared to understand ourselves, to 
listen, and to change our hearts. Selfishness and one's own 
advantage are not an appropriate groundwork for dialogue at a 
time when we need each other. The Lord would have us realize 
that this approach dehumanizes and destroys. Creation itself 
protests the plunder and concentration of wealth that our social 
system brings about, warning mankind that it must change its 
course urgently lest our survival as a planet be short-lived. 
  Why not begin a new path without waiting for social 
institutions to change in response to the despair of those who 
have been subjugated for ages? Instead of forming production 
organizations that bring a further concentration of land, what 
is stopping us, for example, from beginning a dialogue with the 
Ejido Unions to take a fresh step forward? 
  Dialogue, a condition for fraternal relations, requires a 
willingness to listen. A willingness to listen, in turn, is 
based on an acceptance of others, without assuming that they are 
acting in bad faith. Representatives who are kind of word, good 
of heart, and have moral influence will largely assure a 
successful dialogue. 
  Individuals, groups, or communities that have clashed must 
seek to build bridges of communication so that they can be 
transformed through Christian forgiveness. 
  The poor, the downtrodden in society should bear witness to 
the love that Jesus made the sign of his Church. They should 
know that if the Lord favors them with his love (which no one 
deserves), if he calls on them to contribute their values to 
transform society, then this is a society in which the struggle 
is for all. This is not a transformation from which I exclude my 
enemy. Rather, I include him, because his enmity is based on the 
fratricidal society that we wish to change so that the Kingdom 
of God can be established. 
<H5>  9. Farewell </H5>
  The Holy Trinity is the reason for our existence. Conceived 
from eternity as images of the Word, we became part of history 
as followers of Jesus Christ to be faithful images of him. Our 
vocation is to build in this world a model of society that is a 
reflection of the Trinity's Life. 
  Helping the Church of Jesus Christ to become a sacrament of 
this New Creation will bespeak our hope. 
  Unjust inequality runs counter to the plan of God, who makes 
us his tools so that we can live the "year of grace of the 
Lord," the permanent Christian jubilee in which wrongs are 
forgiven and equality established; the hills laid low and the 
valleys filled in to prepare a way for the Lord (Matthew 3:3; 
Luke 3:4-6). 
  No person of the Trinity is inferior to another, nor are 
there any rivalries; no divine person possesses something that 
another lacks. To strive for a social system whose workings and 
institutions abolish plunder and have the sharing of goods as an 
end, so that there are no longer any have-nots, will lead to 
irreversible accomplishments in history. 
  We entrust our path to the Virgin of Guadalupe, who chose to 
embrace our mestizo identity in her cape and, through the 
message that she bequeathed to us through Blessed Juan Diego, to 
give us the assurance that our sufferings would be allayed. May 
she guide us with her benevolent hand.

<F P=106> [Article on interview with Bishop Samuel Ruiz by Cesar </F>
Romero; place and date not given] 
  [Text] He is the sort of man who seems more like a 
whirlwind than a hierarch of the Catholic Church. The strength 
of his convictions makes him something of a rock. While not 
overpowering, the pace of his conversation astounds the 
listener. Questionnaires or attempts to reply are of little use 
with him. He speaks on behalf of the people, as do those who 
know that they are enlightened. Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of the 
diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, is a Christian 
who has been strong enough for decades to take the side of the 
poor, the exploited, and the suffering. From this perspective he 
explains what he vigorously calls "conclusive facts, not mere 
opinions." 
  "The current government is illegitimate; it does not have a 
justification from the people. Mistrust is widespread. Everyone 
is convinced: the system is bad, and the problem is not one 
individual. The problem is not the driver; it is the car, which 
by now is a wreck. PRI [Intitutional Revolutionary Party] is not 
the party of the masses; it is the party of imposition. Until 
the control that the State and its party have over electoral 
processes and mechanisms is ended, there will be no democracy in 
Mexico. If this barrier remains, there could be confrontations 
and tensions between political players outside institutional 
rules and accords during the 1994 political transition. 
  "Our way of life and system of production are oppressing us. 
The privatizations and the Free Trade Agreement are tools that 
capitalism needs to continue benefiting the strong, the 
powerful, both here and overseas. In response to the lack of 
land and unemployment, the government develops political 
controls because the poverty that the plundering of this social 
system produces is a threat to its policies. Thus, laws have to 
be amended and new crimes invented. This approach violates human 
rights. So we can see that the system under which we live 
intrinsically violates human rights. 
  "People are increasingly feeling the weight of high prices, 
unemployment, injustice, and growing poverty. The people are 
dissatisfied. There is malnutrition and disease caused by 
poverty. Wages are very low and are not enough for families to 
live on." 
  In the interview and the pastoral letter that he submitted 
to 
John Paul II, the 68-year old bishop elaborated on his previous 
interpretation of current conditions. As he stressed, "these are 
not opinions; they are facts, and the only ones who do not see 
them are those who refuse to." The forcefulness of his words 
notwithstanding, Ruiz Garcia is even more passionate about 
another issue. 
  [Romero] Don Samuel, what has become of the Church of the 
Poor? It seems that it has been unable to recover since the pope 
reprimanded your group in Puebla in 1979 with the remark that 
"you are priests, not political leaders." 
  [Ruiz] The day that the Church of the Poor is buried, the 
entire Church is buried. John XXIII said that the Church is a 
light, a light for all, and it will not be a Church for all 
unless it is for the poor. If it forgets them, it will be a 
foreign, dominating Church. [end of answer] 
  Hyperactive and unusually energetic, this husky gentleman of 
harsh gestures, little hair, and a kindly look (from behind his 
thick glasses) traveled from Chiapas to Yucatan to see the pope 
and, in passing, meet with the "many bishop brothers" who he 
says also have a strong commitment to the country's 
disadvantaged. At the end of a busy day he answered and 
criticized my questions. 
  [Romero] When the pope visited the last time, there were no 
diplomatic relations with the Holy See and legislation kept 
Churches in a sort of juridical state of sin. This time John 
Paul II will find an amended constitution and will be received 
as a head of state. How major are all these changes? 
  [Ruiz] Not that major. Deep down, little has changed. The 
State does not really recognize the Church. What there is is a 
mold that all must adapt to if they wish to earn the State's 
favor and recognition. What there is is a law designed mainly 
for tariff oversight, tax payments. Moreover, all of these 
changes are keyed to the FTA. 
  [Romero] Excuse me? 
  [Ruiz] Yes, the Free Trade Agreement. The Mexican 
Government's refusal to maintain relations with the Vatican, 
which has relations with the overwhelming majority of countries, 
put Mexico in an archaic position that was incompatible with the 
so-called modernization that the FTA represented. All of these 
measures are not a recognition of the Church (which is not to 
say that there have not been certain changes), because the 
Church does not need recognition to exist. We cannot deny, 
though, that there have been some significant accomplishments, 
such as acknowledgment of our right to run schools, which used 
to be clandestine. Before, they forced you to run a crooked 
operation. Perhaps, though, there are more advantages than under 
nonrecognition, perhaps.... 
  [Romero] Well then, have the changes been useful or not? 
  [Ruiz] I think so. They are not a bad thing. They are 
helping 
to cure the people's schizophrenia about the Church's real and 
official existence. 
  [Romero] It would seem that the world is caught between two 
opposing trends. On the one hand, fundamentalism is resurgent 
(in Jamaica the pope has already denounced "sectarian 
fundamentalism"); on the other, there is a trend toward 
globalization. What should the Church's role in this context be? 
  [Ruiz] There are really more trends than you are talking 
about, but you have to remember that the Church is not the 
parish priest, the bishop, or the pontiff. The Church is you; we 
are all part of it. The Church's function is to be the leaven of 
unity. It is a sort of watershed. The Church defines your stance 
towards life. And it is not just a present or a gift; it is also 
an effort...The Church seeks a new society, one of unity even 
with non-Christians. It calls for a life of charity, not 
selfishness as in today's society. The answer that it proposes 
is: no fulfillment is possible without the good of all. I am 
happy only if I make everyone happy. The only question that we 
will ask ourselves at the final judgment will be: If he was 
hungry, did I feed him? 
  Reliance on the poor represents the only potential for 
change. They are the ones who will have to transform the Church, 
the State, and all of society. Look, I see this all as if it 
were a soccer game. In the first half we are losing, but in the 
second half we are going to win. We have to win! 
  [Romero] Yours is a beautiful dream. How wonderful. 
  [Ruiz] No, we are living it. Such major changes are 
happening 
that at times they are hard to see. Just a while ago we were 
saying Mass in Latin with our backs to the people. Things 
change. For example, although we are seeing human rights being 
trampled terribly today, there is also a widespread awareness 
that this should not be happening. There is a widespread 
politicization in society today. There is repression, but there 
is also protest. People, the people have woken up. And changes 
will not take place in the world except as the result of 
pressure from those down below. [end of answer] 
  A small amber cross shines on the chest of the bishop of San 
Cristobal. A lifetime of work alongside the problems of 
Chiapas's poor has produced a powerful optimism ("Of course, 
because I am a Christian"). He says that ecumenism in Latin 
America will come not from theological confrontation but from a 
commitment to the continent's poor. "The religion is not that 
important (without lapsing into relativism), because suffering 
has no color, religion, or ideology." 
  According to Samuel Ruiz, the suggestion that he seemingly 
does not fit in with the Catholic Church that some of us know 
(high clergy who serve the powerful; charity as an excuse to 
sidestep the issue of justice; bishops and archbishops as a sort 
of decadent aristocracy) is "a tall tale by the press." "No, 
that is not the case. Each person reacts to the world in which 
he lives. My diocese, like others, is made up of poor, suffering 
people. This is why I and other bishops are with them." 
  He also rejects the adjective "progressive." "My Church is 
traditionalist-progressive." He explains: "A boy who was 
completely deaf taught me how to drive and used to say to me: 
`Look around you first; otherwise, don't drive off.' And that is 
the way it is: When I look around myself at realities in Latin 
America, I see poor people. That is why I am with them." 
  What Samuel Ruiz sees around him in Mexico is injustice, 
abuse, and suffering: "This State does not have a justification 
in the people." 
  [Romero] Does that mean that it is illegitimate? 
  [Ruiz] Yes. It does not have credibility. 
  [Romero] And what can you say about PRI? 
  [Ruiz] I do not say it; I see it. It is dependent on the 
government. As I say in the pastoral letter, in which I join my 
voice to that of the people: people are forced to vote for PRI. 
The electoral system is tainted at its source, because the State 
controls the processes to benefit its party. Until these 
practices change, there will be no democracy in Mexico. 
  [Romero] Don Samuel, I see that some of your arguments 
coincide with the basic arguments of the left (such as the 
regime's lack of credibility, the lack of democracy), especially 
with those of the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution].... 
  [Ruiz] I am with the people who are on foot; I am with the 
Gospel. Besides, I do not care what side I am on. I do not 
accept caricatures as a rightist or leftist; that is not for us 
Christians. But if you choose to see radicalism in what I am 
saying, then it is the radicalism of the poor. I feel that power 
must serve; otherwise, it dominates...Like Jesus, I am for the 
poor, even if it means throwing myself into an abyss. [end of 
answer] 
  By now it is close to midnight in a city that is making the 
final preparations for welcoming the pope. Only Samuel Ruiz 
seems not to be tired. He speaks of the letter that he hopes to 
hand personally to "Peter's heir." The burning word of the poor 
in his diocese, the same word of the poor all over Mexico. He is 
categorical in his views of Mexican politics, "which are the 
people's views, not mine." 
  [Romero] Aren't your criticisms unusual, especially now when 
there is so much support for the government? 
  [Ruiz] The problem is not one person. The problem is not the 
driver; it is the car, which by now is a wreck. 
  [Romero] Isn't there room for optimism here? 
  [Ruiz] Both things exist, more repression, exploitation, and 
killing, but also more awareness. That is always the case. Good 
and evil coexist. At times it seems that evil triumphs, that it 
is stronger than good, but God's heart is always inside just 
men. This is why there are irreversible gains in the world as 
well. There is already a very great awareness of the gradual 
process that is under way towards this fundamental conviction: 
either we change or all mankind rages.
