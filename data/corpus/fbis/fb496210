<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Oscar Camacho Guzman] </F>
  [Text] El Bosque, Chiapas, 11 January--Sitting by the door 
of the parish church on a pine bench that was once painted 
brown, Herve Camier Duplouy, the priest in this town nestled in 
the Chiapas highlands, looks with contained rage at the soldiers 
filing into the house of God, bearing weapons and precise 
instructions. 
  "These are times of persecution and harassment for the 
Church 
of the poor in these parts," he says tersely, powerless to do 
anything about the soldiers who are poking around in every 
corner, overturning piled up planks, and peering everywhere some 
"lawbreaker" might be hiding. 
  "They are profaning the church, searching, harassing...," 
murmurs this French-born priest, who at age 56 "embraced the 
option for the poor" in his pastoral work, an option that he has 
been preaching for seven years in this region of northern 
Chiapas. 
  "I think it would be best if you did not bring weapons into 
the church," cried Father Herve Camier Duplouy, but his pleas 
were not heeded this time. 
  The soldiers have taken action. They are part of the 
military 
operation that the Mexican Army has conducted here for the 
second straight day under the assumption that members of the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) are lying in ambush 
somewhere near. A convoy of 1,500 soldiers has arrived in this 
region, backed by three guns and a light tank, to deal with the 
possible presence of "some 100 Zapatists" in the surrounding 
area, as the locals tell it. 
  "Is it legal for them to enter with weapons and search the 
church?" this reporter asked one of the officers who was 
watching the scene from a street corner. 
  "Legal?" he stammered. 
  "Yes, is it legal?" I asked again. The reply was total 
silence. 
  Meanwhile, the French priest, sitting on his old pine bench 
by the door to the church, reflected on this "dirty war," spoke 
of the Church, and quoted Saint Luke and Sacred Scripture. 
  "Do I think that the Church bears some responsibility for 
the 
situation in the state? I do not know. The only thing that I can 
say is that it never has and never will give anybody a single 
weapon. 
  "The Church is not responsible for their taking up arms. No, 
not that. Absolutely not. We are responsible for them, the 
Indians, no longer accepting idols and recognizing themselves as 
equal to others, as children of a single father and mother of 
God. But that is a very honorable responsibility." 
  He repeats: "Yes, we raised people's awareness, but we have 
never given arms." 
  "We have raised people's awareness in spite of their own 
reluctance to believe that they can be free, that they can have 
dignity, because they have always been victims of indifference, 
of scorn...." 
  "Are you surprised by what is happening?" 
  "I see it as a sign that people are tired, that is to say, 
tired of seeing no change in their situation. A situation in 
which they are unable to choose the authorities they want, 
because PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] always wins of 
course. In economic terms, they do not see any improvement in 
their situation, in the unfair prices for their products. They 
are tired of all the red tape, all the marches, all the mass 
actions. I think that it is a sign of tiredness." 
  "Is it easy for a priest to make the preferential option for 
the poor in his pastoral work? Has it been easy for you? Have 
you had problems?" 
  "Well, this preferential option for the poor comes from Holy 
Scripture, from Bartolome de las Casas; it is the model of Jesus 
Christ; Matthew 5:3, and more recently, the Second Vatican 
Council, where many bishops, especially Latin American bishops, 
were converted (paradoxically, they were inspired by the bishops 
from the wealthy countries); and also Samuel Ruiz in his 
pastoral letter, which was published before John Paul II's visit. 
  "First we sided with the rich, thinking that this was 
normal, 
but later we woke up. After the Council we saw that in our 
diocese as of 1974, the Lacandon Forest, which is heavily Indian 
and very poor, woke up, and instead of turning to the rich, the 
bosses, we went straight to the people. 
  "This is something that the powerful are never going to 
forgive Samuel Ruiz for. The diocese then lost its wealthy 
people." 
  "Have you had problems in recent days?" 
  "Yes, but I am not going to allow my heart to be overcome by 
fear. You can sense the hostility among people here, as they do 
not know where to go, they do not know which side is going to be 
stronger. And there are also these people (the soldiers)...It is 
a big stage...a theater, a circus," says the priest, his eyes 
almost tearful, his voice breaking. 
  The priest gazes into the distance towards the lower part of 
the town, where more than 25 trucks, tanks, and hundreds of 
soldiers remain stationed. They arrived in El Bosque on Monday 
after the mayor asked for them because armed rebels were rumored 
to be prowling the area. 
  It all started when five catechizers were arrested and 
thrown 
into the municipal jail. Around 150 people from neighboring 
towns then went to "rescue" them. The residents of this 
municipality say that they were "peasants under arms." But they 
also say that when "they arrived that time to rescue their 
companions, none of them were carrying weapons. They only came 
to get them and took off. But we think that they may return. 
This is why we asked them (the soldiers) to come," say several 
locals who have trouble expressing themselves in a foreign 
language. 
  Meanwhile, army troops hand out food, reminding people all 
the time that it is a gift "from the president of the republic." 
  Sitting on his old wooden bench, the El Bosque parish priest 
says that it has not been easy for people to accept "the 
kindness that you want to show them...It is not easy for these 
people to believe that love can develop so quickly after they 
have been treated with disdain for so long. These people, who 
have always been looked down on, are not going to believe this 
overnight. They are not going to believe so readily. They are 
still going to lower their heads...." 
  "And what about those who have already lifted their heads 
high?" 
  "Oh, I think that they are the rebels!" he says in 
conclusion, while alongside him the soldiers listen, watch, and 
act.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Brazil will participate more actively in 
the final stage of the UN peace operations in Angola by sending 
an Army battalion, military observers, police monitors, and even 
a Navy patrol ship. UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
expressed "great interest" in the Brazilian cooperation. The 
Itamaraty and the Armed Forces General Staff are analyzing the 
request. 
  Brazil will probably prefer to concentrate its help to the 
United Nations in Angola where it has more interest in the field 
of foreign policy and trade. The Brazilian battalion will 
probably have three infantry companies and one mechanized 
company to transport the troops. 
  In the last few days, the Argentine Government consulted its 
Brazilian counterpart about the possibility that the two 
countries jointly offer a naval unit comprised of three patrol 
ships to the United Nations. 
  According to an Itamaraty source, the presence of the 
Brazilian battalion in Angola would be important "to advance the 
peace process in Angola as well as to confirm Brazil's 
contribution to preservation of international peace and 
security." The United Nations has great interest in Brazilian 
cooperation in Angola, particularly because the two countries 
share a common language.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Federal Supreme Court Justice Paulo 
Brossard has granted the extradition of former Bolivian dictator 
Garcia Meza and scheduled his questioning for 16 May. 
Brossard's report states that the crimes of which Garcia Meza 
is accused "also appear in the Brazilian penal code." 
  The former Bolivian president was arrested on 17 March in 
Sao 
Paulo. In Bolivia, he has been sentenced to 30 years in jail 
without the right to amnesty. 
  In addition to genocide (for the execution of leaders of the 
Movement of the Revolutionary Left) and homicide, Garcia Meza 
was sentenced for the following crimes, all of which are cited 
in the Bolivian Penal Code: sedition, armed upheaval against 
state security, usurpation of the rights of the people, abuse of 
authority, violation of personal freedom, violation of freedom 
of the press, influence peddling, the granting of privileges, 
illegal concessions and privileges, illegal association for 
unlawful purposes, businesses incompatible with public 
functions, the organization of ghost associations, peculation, 
concussion [concussao], larceny, embezzlement, crimes against 
the economy, fraud, abuse of confidence, inadequate use of 
influence, failure to fulfill duties, destruction and 
deterioration of government assets and, finally, exporting of 
national historic documents (the sale of Che Guevara's and Harry 
Pombo Villegas' diaries).

  [Excerpt] Sao Paulo - After visiting the 20th Century 
Brazilian biennial art exhibit in Sao Paulo yesterday, Finance 
Minister Rubens Ricupero said "the real will begin circulating 
even before approval of the provisional measure, which will be 
reedited as many times as necessary." Ricupero said the text 
will include the salary adjustment measures that were negotiated 
with Congress. 
  The minister said the new text sets forth that the 
government 
will compensate any salary loss caused by the conversion into 
URV's [Real Value Units]. He reiterated that the president will 
"shortly" announce the implementation of the new currency, but 
he did not specify the date. The minister said the period 
between the announcement and the implementation of the new 
currency can be longer than the 35 days provided for by the 
provisional measure. Ricupero said the provisional measure that 
creates the real has not yet been drawn up. He said: "This will 
follow the presidential announcement." 
  The minister said he does not believe the rural bloc will 
impede approval of the provisional measure again. "The bloc is 
not that big, there has been some exaggeration," he said, adding 
that the provisional measure should be approved in May, with the 
support of other parties. "Even if it is not approved, it will 
not delay the implementation of the real," he said, pointing out 
that the measure can be reedited an unspecified number of times. 
"Provisional measures operate as laws and come into force as of 
the time they are submitted to Congress," he explained. [passage

  [Excerpt] Brasilia -- Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the PT 
[Workers Party] presidential candidate, is planning to make this 
year a campaign that will be quite similar to that of 1989. As 
in 1989, his vice presidential candidate will again be Jose 
Paulo Bisol, a senator for the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party] 
from Rio Grande do Sul. His campaign jingle in electoral 
rallies and television programs will again be "Lula-la," 
although this time its backdrop will consist of rock and samba 
music and sheer fun. The alliance that is now proposing Lula's 
candidacy is the Brazilian Front of Citizens [Frente Brasil da 
Cidadania], which will be only slightly different from the 1989 
coalition. This front will include the People's Socialist Party 
and the PSTU [United Social Workers Party] and will exclude the 
Vanguard Party. There will be just a slight change in the PT 
strategy: The 1989 slogan No Fear of Happiness will be replaced 
by a new one: It Was Worth the Wait. 
  Lula has already picked his vice president, whose name will 
not be announced until May. Yesterday, Lula and Bisol had 
breakfast together and decided the ticket. Addressing Bisol, 
Lula said: "As far as the PT is concerned, you will be my vice 
president. It is now up to the PSB to decide. The PSB will 
formally nominate Bisol on 9 May as soon as it concludes 
consultations with the PSB grassroots. PSB branches of 17 
states have already endorsed Bisol, except for the one in Minas 
Gerais, which would like to nominate Belo Horizonte Deputy Mayor 
Celio de Castro. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Most Controversial Issues"; </F>
approved during a PT party convention on 1 May] 
  [Text] Land Reform -- This is a priority for Lula. It will 
be immediately implemented after his inauguration, if he wins. 
The PT plans to immediately resolve the problem of rural 
workers camping along highways. Some 19,000 families live under 
such conditions. A definitive land reform will be implemented 
over a 15-year period. The program provides for the distribution 
of land and an agricultural policy to assist 3 million landless 
families. The state will provide technical assistance and 
invest in techniques for using the soil. 
  Minimum Salary -- Lula has promised to raise the minimum 
salary to $300 toward the end of his mandate. The proposal was 
made by the PT Struggle faction, but was not backed even by CUT 
[Sole Workers Center] President Jair Meneguelli, who abstained 
from referring to the issue, or by Rio Grande de Sul Deputy 
Paulo Paim, who is the former president of the Labor Committee. 
The PT plenary session preferred to back the original text of 
the proposed program, which provides for "the gradual, steady 
increase of the minimum salary. In real terms, it seeks to 
double its value in the shortest possible time, reaching the 
level indicated by DIEESE [Interunion Department for Statistics 
and Socioeconomic Studies] ($350) at a later stage." Sao Paulo 
Deputy Aluizio Mercadante, the main economist of the PT bloc, 
justified the decision on the grounds that the program mentions 
no quantities. He added: "The growth rate of the minimum salary 
will be established by the process. It cannot be defined in the 
party's identification badge." The PT believes establishing a 
value might become a trap and a target for attacks from 
adversaries. "If the salary reaches $295, they will say the 
government did not fulfill its promise," Meneguelli noted. "We 
cannot advocate wishful thinking," Paim said. 
  Abortion -- The PT decided to soften the abortion issue in 
its program. The text advocating the legalization of abortion 
was replaced by a general statement that limits itself to 
advocating the use of the public health network for abortion 
cases provided for by law (rape and life risk for the mother). 
Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino justified the change, saying: 
"The campaign should take into account the balance of power and 
society's level of understanding and conscience." 
  Homosexuals -- The 9th PT Convention did not debate the 
proposal on marriage between homosexuals. The basic text of the 
program was eliminated. The text carries a general statement 
saying the future government should take the initiative to 
propose legal measures permitting marriage between homosexuals. 
The PT withdrew the proposal from the program. 
  Government -- The PT proposes creation of the Ministries of 
Employment and Social Security to replace the Ministries of 
Labor, Social Security, and Social Welfare. The Presidency of 
the Republic will be strengthened with an increased number of 
secretariats and with a reduction in the number of ministries. 
Mercadante is the most likely candidate for the Finance 
Ministry, although economists Paulo Nogueira Batista and Maria 
de Conceicao Tavares, and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Serra have also been mentioned. PT 
economist Paul Singer might be designated to the Planning 
Ministry. 
  Anti-Imperialism -- The effort to defeat the radicals broke 
one of the bases of the PT's three-point anti-imperialist 
program (moratorium, fight against monopolies, fight against 
latifundia). In its party program, the PT defines itself as a 
socialist party that favors breaking with the IMF. The program 
does not mention the "anti-imperialist fight." Marcos Sokol, of 
the PT Struggle faction said: "This is discouraging for party 
members. One of our stronger principles has been affected."

  [Text] Luis Inacio Lula da Silva plans to lead a bloc of 
debtor countries to negotiate with creditors. In his first news 
conference as an official candidate, Lula said that, if elected, 
he will seek to form a bloc of poor countries and noted that he 
would only break relations with the IMF if creditors are 
intransigent. He added: "One cannot discuss social issues with 
the IMF managing director." 
  Upon closing the 9th Workers Party [PT] convention, Lula 
resigned as PT president. He was replaced by Deputy Rui Falcao, 
a member of PT radical group, who was elected in return for the 
radical groups' agreement to withdraw their proposal for a debt 
moratorium from the PT platform. Lula then canceled a rally 
following the death of car racer Ayrton Senna. 
  Lula said he does not fear capital flight from the country 
if 
he is elected president because "there has always been capital 
flight here." He believes the final version of the PT program 
shows rich countries that the PT "is aware of the responsibility 
entailed in ruling a country as important as Brazil, which needs 
to adopt a political position in keeping with its standing, and 
thus prevent it from being treated as a mere exporter of kiwi 
fruits." Euphoric over his victory over PT radicals, Lula said 
the PT remains united and that "the war predicted by the press 
prior to the convention never took place."

  [Excerpt] Ex-mayor Luiza Erundina, who yesterday afternoon 
attended the final developments of the convention that nominated 
Lula as presidential candidate of the PT [Workers Party], was 
not involved in any of the negotiations over the controversial 
issues of the program of government. The absence of Erundina, 
who held the highest public post the PT has ever achieved -- the 
post of mayor of Sao Paulo -- is another symptom of the great 
dilemma of the PT: The leaders of ideological groups, who define 
the course to be followed by the party, are not the ones who are 
tested by the ballot boxes and who are connected with society. 
  People like Sao Paulo Senator Eduardo Suplicy or former 
Santos Mayor Telma de Souza, who stand at the party's forefront 
in electoral confrontations, were consulted even less. Their 
opinions awaken much less interest than the views of movement 
leaders like State Deputy Rui Falcao of the Leftist Option 
group, who should assume the presidency of the party, or 
economist Marcos Sokol of the PT Struggle faction, which 
represents the most radical trend. 
  Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino, who has become increasingly 
isolated as leader of the ultra-moderate Radical Democracy 
group, believes this lack of equivalence between internal power 
and social power will be resolved only with a membership 
campaign. "We must bring as many people as we can to the 
party," Genoino said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Such is Politics" column by Dora Kramer: "Lula </F>
Now Thinks Only About the Government"] 
  [Text] The PT [Workers' Party] convention, which ended 
yesterday with the formalization of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's 
candidacy to the presidency, focused on internal problems. 
After overcoming the barrier built by the radicals who, in the 
opinion of the candidate's staff are the only ones who can make 
him lose the election, the campaign has gained the tone of 
anticipated victory. Lula believes his adversaries have helped a 
lot by engaging in actions that can be easily criticized. He is 
now focusing his attention on Planalto Palace. He is currently 
working on the basis of winning in the first round. 
  He will try to show both home and abroad that he is capable 
of governing without the rancid leftist taste of the radicals 
who have infested the PT. He assures that his government will 
have a broad base, not from the viewpoint of ideology but of 
ethics, with a commitment to the interests of the majority. To 
show this broadness, last Fridya, one of Lula's closest advisers 
reminded a group at the Petronio Portela hall in the Senate that 
when Itamar Franco took over, Lula defended the continuation of 
Adib Jatene at the Health Ministry. 
  This shows that Lula is not prejudiced against inviting a 
former secretary of the Paulo Maluf government to join his team, 
provided, of course, he supports the party program. The idea is 
difficult to implement, but it reflects maturity. This is the 
position Lula will use when he arrives in the United States on 7 
May for a five-day visit to New York and Washington. He will 
introduce himself as a future Brazilian president, committed to 
reactivating Latin America's largest country. It is a major 
step that should be matched by his actions. 
  He has a busy agenda. Since Bill Clinton, Hillary, and Al 
Gore have already said they will not meet with candidates, no 
meeting has been sought. The White House couple has its own 
domestic CPI [Congressional Investigative Committee] problems, 
which we have already experienced here. Lula will contact the 
State Department, the House of Representatives, and will deliver 
a briefing at the Senate. He will meet businessmen, grant 
interviews to THE WASHINGTON POST and THE NEW YORK TIMES, and 
talk with representatives of nongovernmental organizations and 
with environmentalists. To the latter, he hopes to convey a 
good image because, as Lula's external affairs advisers have 
warned, they strongly influence U.S. foreign policy. 
  Brazilian news abroad has recently been quite negative, with 
child prostitution, the killing of minors, a sizable robbery in 
congress, etc., and so Lula will say that the country needs a 
"social reform shock" and that to this end it must be 
politically and economically stable. The national project that 
Lula will outline abroad seeks economic stability through 
reforms in order to end the social marginalization of the 
majority of Brazilians. 
  In the foreign policy field, Lula will try to debate 
Brazil's 
role in the world. He believes the country has no consistent 
foreign policy, not through any fault of Itamaraty but because 
of the lack of a national project. Lula says he considers the 
nationalist, development-oriented projects of the 1960's are 
exhausted, explaining that he rejects the neoliberal position 
under which the country should join the international economy in 
a subordinate position. He will explain that Brazil's problems 
with the United States are not ideological but economic and 
commercial. 
  Lula may succeed in the country he will visit for the third 
time, yet he will have to face competition from Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso who, without doubt, is an internationally 
recognized figure because of his tenure at the Finance Ministry. 
Asked about this, PT Foreign Affairs Adviser Marco Aurelio 
Garcia hesitated for some seconds before replying: "Fernando 
Henrique is deja vu." 
  Upon returning from the United States, Lula will return to 
his preferred public: the poor. An evaluation of the campaigns 
has revealed that the caravans were successful. The polls show 
that Lula's popularity grew from 18 to 36 percent thanks to his 
tours of Brazil, and so the formula will be repeated. This time 
it will be on a minor scale. He will choose places that are 
strongly affected by starvation and misery, and will spend two 
or three days listening to the have-nots. For example, he will 
go to the Fluminense area in Rio de Janeiro and to Ribeira 
Valley, in Sao Paulo State. 
  The program for the World Soccer Cup has already been 
designed. Lula and his entourage will sail down the San 
Francisco River from Pirapora to Juazeiro, to symbolize national 
integration, which will be represented by the velho chico [not 
further identified]. This will end last week in July. The PT 
will then concentrate on television programs and on large 
rallies.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Maria Mayrink: "Church Prepares To </F>
Influence Elections"] 
  [Text] Sao Paulo -- The Catholic Church wants to debate 
parties and politicians regarding the country's situation and 
proposed solutions to the economic crisis on the basis of 
conclusions reached at the Second Brazilian Social Week, which 
the CNBB [National Conference of Brazilian Bishops] will sponsor 
in July to influence this year's elections. The results of the 
debates at that meeting will be supplied to the candidates for 
president of the republic, and they will be invited to 
participate in the closing session. 
  "This project of ours dates back to 1992, but we decided to 
postpone the end of the discussion until the last half of the 
year because 1994 is an election year, and it will provide an 
excellent opportunity to reflect on political education and the 
exercise of citizenship," says Demetrio Valentini, bishop of 
Jales, Sao Paulo, and head of the CNBB's Pastoral Commission on 
Social Affairs. 
  The objectives and agenda of the Second Social Week, the 
topic of which is "Brazil, Alternatives and Protagonists," will 
be announced on the 24th of this month by Bishop Demetrio and 
the president of the CNBB, Bishop Luciano Mendes de Almeida. "We 
will publish the text that will serve as the working document 
for debate on the basis of the conclusions reached at the 
"regional weeks" which, over the past two years, have resulted 
in viable alternatives for building the Brazil that people 
want," Demetrio announced. 
  Depending on the results of the debates in Brasilia, the 
CNBB 
will publish or recommend that the bishops of Brazil's 245 
dioceses publish booklets providing guidance for the elections. 
The head of the Pastoral Commission on Social Affairs points out 
that the church's concern is not limited to the electoral 
aspect; it will take advantage of this opportunity to discuss 
the future of Brazil. 
  "Even if we publish booklets, study notes, or any other kind 
of document, we are not going to endorse parties or candidates. 
We will draw attention to values and principles that will 
provide the voters with norms so they can make the best 
choices," Demetrio said. The church intends to influence the 
process, he admits, but without engaging in partisan politics. 
"We want to lay the foundation so that no matter who wins the 
election, there will be a consensus capable of ensuring the 
country's governability." 
  The CNBB is also concerned about the tone of the campaign: 
"The campaign must not be reduced to personal attacks, because 
the people are expecting the candidates to present their ideas 
and proposals," the bishop warns. Regardless of their 
ideological leanings, all the politicians vying for the most 
important offices -- especially the posts of state governor and 
president of the Republic -- will be invited to debate their 
programs. 
<H5>  Booklets for Sao Paulo Faithful </H5>
  Two episcopal regions in the Archdiocese of Sao Paulo -- 
Brasilandia and Santana, both in the capital's Northern Zone -- 
are already preparing booklets to provide voters with guidance. 
Neither of the two will mention the names of candidates or 
parties, but their documents, written in colloquial style, will 
draw attention to good qualities and denounce manipulations as a 
way of helping the faithful make their choices. 
  The work is being done by groups from the Pastoral 
Commission 
on Faith and Politics, which are debating alternatives to the 
national crisis. "We have the support of our bishop, Angelico 
Bernardino, but he is not intervening directly in the 
discussion," says social worker Fatima de Araujo Giorlano, one 
of the coordinators of the Brasilandia group. The bishop is 
merely supervising the publications to ensure that they conform 
to the doctrine of the Catholic Church. 
  At the Alceu Amoroso Lima Center in the Santana episcopal 
region, the Pastoral Commission on Faith and Politics vows that 
in this year's elections, it will repeat the success it had with 
a booklet published in connection with the election of the mayor 
and municipal councilors in 1992. "Norma and Maximo, the two 
people who illustrated the texts on the municipal elections, 
will be back to do their best to convince people that it is 
important to vote," said bank employee Sonia Maria Gimenez, the 
center's secretary. 
  The head of the Episcopal Vicariate for Builders of Society, 
Canon Dario Bevillacqua, has announced that the Archdiocese of 
Sao Paulo will not publish a general booklet because it prefers 
to leave that job to the pastoral groups.

  [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President Fidel 
Castro announced that the measures to strengthen the country's 
domestic finances began this week with a fight against 
individuals who become rich illegally. The president said he is 
already drafting a decree to confiscate illegally acquired 
property [words indistinct] in an expedited and noncomplicated 
manner. 
  Castro said the government will not rest for a single moment 
in applying the measures, which the Cuban parliament decided to 
implement today following a two-day debate and an extensive 
consultation of the people during the first three months of the 
year. He said all the decisions cannot be implemented together 
because they need to be put in order. 
  The fight against those who become rich illegally here, 
called "profiteers," was one of the primary demands in more than 
80,000 consultations convened by labor unions, in which 
approximately 3 million workers participated. 
  The purpose of this process, dubbed here "workers 
parliaments," was to learn about the people's opinions on needed 
measures to face the country's current crisis caused by the U.S. 
blockade and the loss of traditional trade relations following 
the disappearance of the European Socialist Bloc.

  [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President Fidel 
Castro announced that among the measures to be implemented for 
the country's economic recovery is an increase of electricity 
rates because of the excessive rise in consumption. 
  This measure was announced by the Cuban president during the 
close of a special session of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government (ANPP) (parliament) convened to review and 
find solutions to the economic crisis facing the country. 
  There is no other option; in Havana alone, the consumption 
of 
electricity has increased 24 percent because of the use of 
electric stoves due to the lack of other fuels, he said. He 
added, however, that the government will not rest a minute until 
it finds a solution to this situation. 
  As for the increase of tobacco prices, the president asked 
for prudence and that estimates be made before the application 
of the measure because of its effect on the population. 
  During the inauguration of the event the day before, Finance 
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez recommended an increase in 
cigarette prices in a report to the ANPP, which could provide 
the government with 2 billion pesos in taxes per year, (a peso 
is equivalent to the dollar at the official exchange rate). 
  Fidel Castro pointed out that the decisions to be adopted in 
this area are aimed at overcoming the current crisis, which he 
compared to the 10-year war period of 1868-78, the first Cuban 
attempt to militarily achieve independence from Spain. 
  In this regard, he pointed out that even though many 
considered it impossible, four years after the collapse of the 
socialist bloc, "here is Cuba, in the Caribbean, and 90 miles 
from the United States."

  [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Cuba is ready to make 
concessions that are indispensable to adapting its economy to 
the new international reality without renouncing socialist 
principles, President Fidel Castro said today upon closing the 
special session of the parliament. 
  The president stressed that the measures proposed by the 
National Assembly of the People's Government to cleanse the 
country's economy defend the spirit of socialism without 
disregarding the reality of a world that is in the hands of 
multinationals. 
  Appealing to the people's understanding on the need to adopt 
these measures promptly, the president insisted on the 
advantages of this action over the neoliberal recipes which, he 
asserted, have caused crises in various countries, particularly 
in the social area. 
  Fidel Castro called for a broad dissemination of all topics 
discussed at the parliament, in search of the broadest popular 
support. In this regard, he highlighted the earlier speech by 
Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, who recalled what is the 
fate proposed for the island from Miami. He added that 
well-to-do and large landowners, whose properties were 
expropriated by the 1959 revolution, want to return from Miami 
to claim their former properties and privileges. 
  The Cuban president noted the need to act perfectly and 
quickly, while guaranteeing not only the recovery of excess 
circulating currency but also a progressive improvement of the 
economic situation to insure that disequilibrium is not 
reproduced. 
  Fidel Castro affirmed the measures will be gradual but "will 
not be left unimplemented." He termed the parliament's final 
resolution "broad and flexible," which will permit the 
government to act to correct disequilibrium and its causes. 
  According to official figures from this Assembly, Cuba is 
facing a budget deficit of 4.2 billion pesos (equal to dollars 
at the official Cuban exchange rate) and an excess of 
circulating currency estimated at 11.636 billion pesos. These 
indicators are considered one of the main obstacles on the path 
to economic recovery.

  [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President Fidel 
Castro said that for his country, there is no possible 
alternative to the preservation of sovereignty and a solution to 
the economic crisis than to maintain socialist principles. 
  At the closing of a session of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP], which approved guidelines for the 
strengthening of the country's finances, Castro said it is 
necessary to make concessions to adapt the country to a world 
dominated by capitalism, but without moving away from the 
country's principles. 
  Speaking to more than 550 deputies and several dozen foreign 
and Cuban guests, he ruled out the possible application of 
neoliberal formulas because, according to him, these measures 
have not solved problems such as unemployment, which continues 
to increase even if the economy grows. In his opinion, the 
world is in the hands of the multinational companies and 
capitalism, and this situation will continue for a relatively 
long time, a reality that the Revolution will have to bear in 
mind. He pointed out that Cuba is willing to make concessions 
but only the indispensable ones to survive and develop. 
  Fidel Castro noted that the survival of socialism in Cuba, 
almost four years after the disappearance of the USSR, is also 
taking place at a time in which the country is blockaded by the 
United States and its anti-Cuban policy. 
  He pointed out, however, that despite this situation, the 
number of foreign companies interested in investing in Cuba has 
increased because the nation occupies an important position 
among the countries considered safe for investment. 
  The Cuban president said the current problem is not limited 
to domestic finances, a topic that was debated by the ANPP, 
because the scarcity of foreign exchange considerably limits the 
purchasing of food, medicines, fuel, raw materials, and spare 
parts to keep the economy running. 
  He noted that the reactivation of the economy is a difficult 
process because the agriculture sector has to work with a 
shortage of pesticides, fertilizers, and the country lacks the 
resources to purchase steel with which to manufacture plows. 
  Cuban President Fidel Castro said, however, that the country 
is not discouraged and is facing the difficulties under complex 
conditions. For example, he said sugarcane cutters do not even 
have the appropriate shoes, workers are poorly dressed, and 
workers are not eating the proper foods for the jobs they 
perform. 
  In this regard, he described as an example of courage the 
agreements reached today by the ANPP to create an integral tax 
system, to increase the prices of certain products, to eliminate 
certain free services and subsidies because of company losses, 
as well as to recover the value of the peso, without ruling out 
the exchange of money to achieve it. 
  He pointed out that the government will not rest in applying 
this measure designed by the ANPP; it will do so gradually but 
without delay because it will begin this week with the passage 
of a decree on the confiscation of illegally acquired property.

<F P=106> [By Walfredo Angulo] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- The Cuban National Assembly's 
current extraordinary session constitutes a peculiar and 
unprecedented meeting, but an analysis of financial improvements 
will not end the debate, National Assembly President Ricardo 
Alarcon said today. 
  In statements for PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon pointed out that 
the 
final resolution will serve as a foundation for State Council 
legislation. There is a consensus among the 551 assembly 
members, he said, regarding the contents of that document, which 
will outline the general guidelines and policy to be followed 
with regard to the measures that are undertaken. 
  The consultation process initiated four months ago with the 
participation of approximately 3 million workers, students, and 
peasants will not end, he said, adding that at the end of this 
month rank-and-file meetings will be initiated in the 
neighborhoods during which regional delegates will reflect on 
these complex economic issues with the people. Thus, the 
measures adopted and those about to be executed will continue to 
be debated in what Alarcon characterized as Cuban society's 
uninterrupted process of parliamentarism. 
  Alarcon added that the labor unions will soon initiate a 
series of assemblies at all the work centers, thereby 
reestablishing the examination of economic efficiency, increased 
production, and profitability. He said the Assembly members are 
more prepared now than they were in December, when the Assembly 
initiated the debate on financial reorganization. 
  I, especially, participated in over 50 meetings throughout 
the country and all the National Assembly members accompanied me 
and participated in the national debate, he said. 
  Alarcon described as very positive the results of the first 
day of sessions, at which over 30 deputies spoke outlining the 
paths that should be followed and the measures that should be 
implemented to resolve such a complex problem as Cuba's current 
financial imbalance. 
  According to figures provided by Jose Luis Rodriquez, 
minister of finance and prices, at present, there is a working 
capital surplus estimated at approximately 11.3 billion pesos 
(equivalent to dollars at the government exchange rate). 
  Cuba is also burdened with a budget deficit of approximately 
4.2 billion pesos, which we are trying to counteract by 
eliminating subsidies because of the losses suffered by 
unprofitable businesses, the selective increase of prices and 
rates, and a new tax system.

  [Text] Havana, 3 May (PL) -- The U.S. Government has 
impeded Cuban Foreign Ministger Roberto Robaina from 
participating in a panel discussion organized by a U.S. media 
company by not granting him the necessary visa on time. 
  Robaina was invited to visit the city of Atlanta by Turner 
Broadcasting Corporation [TBS], the consortium that operates 
CNN. The corporation invited Robaina to take part in the seminar 
it organizes annually. The seminar is attended by 
representatives of clients worldwide. 
  This information was confirmed to PRENSA LATINA by Cuban 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso, who explained that 
Robaina had planned to speak about the situation in his country. 
Alfonso noted that the list of guests included UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev. 
  The journalistic event began on 1 May. Robaina should have 
traveled on 29 April. Because of this, he requested the visa 
from the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba 25 [word indistinct] 
earlier. TBS executives also contacted the U.S. State Department 
about this matter. 
  Alfonso said, however, time went by without news on the 
granting of any visa, and on 28 April, faced with the 
impossibility of travel caused by the delay and a lack of 
explanation from Washington, the Cuban Foreign Ministry had to 
withdraw its passports from the U.S. Interests Section. 
  Curiously, the spokesman noted, the next day, in Washington, 
the U.S. Secret Service went to the Cuban Interests Section 
inquiring about bilateral cooperation to guarantee Robaina's 
personal security during his stay in U.S. territory. 
  There was never any answer to the visa request and no 
information was given to Cuba regarding a situation that 
prevented the Cuban foreign minister from attending a meeting to 
which he had been invited. 
  Alfonso said the U.S. Government's position represents a 
continuation of a policy through which it denies the principles 
of freedom of expression it claims to defend.

<F P=106> [By Elsy Fors] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- The Cuban parliament has 
displayed flexibility and economic realism without relinquishing 
social achievements in education and public health. After two 
days of discussions on the most burning economic problems, the 
special session of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [ANPP] drafted guidelines that will allow the 
government to immediately adopt tangible measures against 
economic imbalances and domestic speculators. 
  The ANPP's final resolution calls on the state to exert 
strict control over its expenditures and to oversee its public 
resources systematically. Figures from the Ministry of Finance 
and Prices reveal Cuba has a budget deficit of 4.2 billion pesos 
(official exchange rate is one peso per dollar). 
  The parliament voiced its "flat-out opposition to the 
unscrupulous activities of those who have become wealthy or who 
are trying to become wealthy at the expense of the majority." 
The ANPP instructed the government to take steps, even 
exceptional steps, to eradicate such activities. To that 
effect, President Fidel Castro forewarned of the confiscation of 
ill-gotten money and illegally acquired properties. 
  Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon, in one of his speeches 
considered by many observers as bearing an impressive 
ideological message, recalled the fate of the island being 
forged in Miami. He said wealthy emigrants and large 
landowners, whose properties were confiscated by the revolution 
in 1959, are promoting a return to Cuba to reclaim their 
properties and privileges. 
  In addition, there is another fact that discourages the 
adoption of neoliberal shock therapy in Cuba, namely, social 
deterioration triggered by such therapy in developing countries 
where it has been applied. 
  According to official opinions, social inequities being 
prompted by the economic reforms implemented in Cuba is a minor 
setback when compared to the consequences of the neoliberal 
policies imposed by such international financial organizations 
as the IMF and the World Bank. 
  On the other hand, the measures proposed by the Cuban 
legislature protect the fundamental achievement of providing 
free health care and education without failing to acknowledge 
that the island is becoming part of a world controlled by 
multinational corporations and by a market economy. 
  The adjustments proposed include price increases on selected 
goods and services, as well as the gradual implementation of a 
new and integral tax system that will offer lower-income sectors 
the greatest possible protection. The parliament also asked the 
government to study the possibility of changing the currency to 
complement the measures in due time. 
  The ANPP's final resolution states that the measures "will 
lead to the progressive surmounting of current adversities." To 
achieve this, the parliament exhorted the people to "intensify 
their daily efforts." 
  Some participants of the special session believe the final 
results will restore fiscal and financial order, which had been 
neglected during decades of integration into the economic system 
of former socialist countries. At the same time, the results 
will yield greater trust in foreign investments. 
  In short, although the fall of the Soviet Union made the 
island lose three-fourths of its trade and its main source of 
foreign aid, most deputies and economists believe the current 
independent development will be more advantageous in the long 
run.

  [Text] Havana, 3 May (PL) -- Cuba stated today that Nelson 
Mandela and his people constitute the reality of South Africa's 
dream come true: to have apartheid beheaded. 
  An editorial by the newspaper GRANMA, official organ of the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, salutes the 
electoral triumph of the African National Congress (ANC) in the 
South African elections which, with its victory, has crowned the 
process sealed in the fierce fighting of Cuito Cuanavale in 
Angola. 
  GRANMA says that, the historic battle and defeat suffered by 
the racist army in the face of the resistance of the Angolans 
and Cuban international fighters changed the correlation of 
forces in South Africa and led to the current triumph of the 
South African people. 
  Regarding the struggle and merits of ANC leader Nelson 
Mandela, the paper states that when he assumes his nation's 
presidency, the world will have occasion to render tribute to 
his wisdom, courageous revolutionary stance, and unwavering 
principles. 
  It can be seen in all its dimensions that the triumph 
corresponds to those who struggle and the example offered must 
be again appreciated. The value of this example is heightened 
at this shameful moment when so many have lowered their flags 
and have repented for what they once were, it states. 
  The newspaper criticizes the regime of racial discrimination 
that existed in South Africa, noting that capitalism and 
imperialism were responsible for instilling in that state the 
notion of superior and inferior races. 
  We are proud to have been and to continue to be close 
companions of arms of Nelson Mandela and of the South African 
people, the GRANMA editorial concludes.

  [Text] Havana, 3 May (PL) -- Colombian Foreign Minister 
Noemi Sanin began a visit to Cuba today at the invitation of the 
Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry to bolster bilateral relations 
and to sign cultural cooperation agreements. 
  Sanin was greeted at Jose Marti Airport in the capital by 
her 
Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina, Colombian Ambassador to Cuba 
Ricardo Santamaria Salamanca, and Cuban Ambassador to Colombia 
Jesus Martinez Beaton. 
  Just after her arrival in Havana, the chief of Colombian 
diplomacy laid a wreath at the monument of Cuban national hero 
Jose Marti at Revolution Square, and later she headed to the 
headquarters of the Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry to begin 
official talks. 
  Sanin's visit was preceded in the past few weeks by visits 
by 
the Colombian ministers of health, mines, and agriculture and a 
meeting here of a joint intergovernmental commission for 
economic and scientific-technical cooperation. This reflects an 
intensification in relations between Havana and Santa Fe de 
Bogota. 
  During her visit, Sanin will have a busy schedule of 
activities that includes a visit to the National Library to 
donate books and to the House of the Americas to donate several 
works of art.

  [Text] Bridgetown, 2 May (PL) -- Today, Fernando Ramirez de 
Estenoz, Cuban ambassador to the United Nations and first 
foreign relations vice minister, begins heading a UN mission 
before the World Conference of Small Island States meeting in 
Barbados. 
  Ramirez de Estenoz told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba was selected 
to preside over a special group, including Syria, Tunisia, and a 
UN official, to negotiate in the name of the UN's decolonization 
committee at the Bridgetown session. "It has to do with 
consulations on a very important and delicate topic, dealing 
with the colonial status of some member-countries of the 
alliance of small island states," the diplomat said. 
  Of the 41 members of the alliance, known as AOSIS, nearly 
one-fifth still maintain a colonial status. In the Caribbean, 
French overseas territories (Martinique and Guadeloupe), 
Montserrat, Anguila, Bermuda, Turks and Caicos, and the Virgin 
Islands have not yet gained independence. 
  One of the problems that makes the UN decolonization 
committee's work difficult is that in most of these territories, 
under colonial tutelage economic development prospects, future 
independence is unfavorable in the current international 
situation. 
  In Anguila and Bermuda, several plebiscites have resulted in 
majority votes against independence because the population 
considers survival in these small states unlikely without 
financial backing.

  [Text] Havana, 30 Apr (PL) -- Today, a Cuban assembly 
committee reviewed a bill on citizenship, [word indistinct], 
loss, and recovery as a preamble to the special session the 
island's top legislative branch will begin tomorrow. 
  Ramon de la Cruz Ochoa, chairman of the Constitutional and 
Legal Affairs Committee of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [ANPP], stressed the importance of the document under 
review, which paves the way for implementing of some of the 
agreements of the recently concluded meeting between the 
government and emigres. "The Nation and the Emigrants 
Conference," summoned by the Cuban Foreign Ministry, was held 
last weekend with the presence of more than 200 Cubans living 
abroad and broached many of those topics. 
  De la Cruz said citizenship constitutes the individual's 
legal and political link with the state and that it establishes 
reciprocal rights and obligations. He said the objective of the 
future law is [word indistinct], regulate the issuance of the 
appropriate documents that give proof of it. The analysis, which 
also served for a review of a bill on the organizing and 
functioning of the legislative branch, had [sentence incomplete

  Another aspect the committee reviewed was the drafting of a 
bill on the principles and norms to bring in close association 
different cities of the world and their Cuban counterparts, a 
sign, in the lawmakers' opinion, of the growing solidarity with 
the Cuban cause. 
  Meanwhile, the Health, Sports, and Environment Committee 
centered its debates on the medicine control program that will 
be implemented soon. Public Health Minister Julio Teja voiced 
his optimism that the measures adopted tomorrow will alleviate 
the current shortage of certain medicines and meet the people's 
needs. 
  The Education, Culture, Science, and Technology Committee is 
devoting today's work [words indistinct] to outlining the 
self-financing system approved to guarantee the continuation of 
the activities of that sector. Abel Prieto, president of the 
Union of Writers and Artists, [sentence incomplete as received]

  [Text] Havana, 1 May (PL) -- The current year will continue 
to be difficult for the Cuban economy, but some sectors' results 
show the first signs of recovery, Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of 
the Parliament's Economic Affairs Commission, said today. We 
cannot yet speak of short-term recovery, but we must refer to 
things that are going well and allow ourselves to anticipate 
good results, the deputy stated in a lengthy interview with 
Sunday's weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE. 
  Martinez also explained that the country is moving toward an 
economic model that, without abandoning the basic principles of 
socialism, will function without disregarding the market, with 
forms of private property and a strong presence of foreign 
capital. Martinez cited tourism, which has a 30-percent annual 
growth rate, as the first positive aspect of the island's 
economic performance, adding that it will shortly exceed the 
sugar industry as the main source of revenue for the nation. He 
also mentioned the growing production of petroleum, which is 
expected to exceed [word indistinct] 1.1 million tons produced 
last year. 
  There is an investment process of foreign capital in the 
area 
of petroleum, which shows interest in Cuba's petroleum 
potential, Martinez noted. He added that the fact that these 
companies challenge the blockade and U.S. threats demonstrates 
that there are reasonably good prospects for finding petroleum 
deposits. 
  He also explained that new forms of exploiting state-owned 
land, granted for the use of former workers, now organized in 
cooperatives, will permit a significant increase in food 
production. The measures the government will adopt to cleanse 
internal finances, he remarked, will have immediate positive 
results for the economy, although its basic effect will require 
no less than one and a half years to mature. 
  He said measures will undoubtedly have positive effects on 
the recovery, namely to return to the path of growth. Martinez 
added that by the end of the century, Cuba will begin overcoming 
this adverse situation and will do so by "not only returning to 
the path of economic growth, but achieving a qualitatively 
different economy." 
  The lawmaker affirmed the country will have greater levels 
of 
efficiency expressed in high worker productivity, as well as 
domestic and export-related productive efficiency. He said it 
must be an economy with a strong state sector that outlines the 
economic path and operates following decentralized 
administration mechanisms in which economic categories play a 
more important role than administrative mechanisms. Martinez 
said the model being designed will attach greater importance to 
the market and to a strong presence of foreign capital. 
  A sector of self-employed workers, which is expected to grow 
in the future, will coexist together with the guiding role of 
the state and a very important cooperative sector in 
agriculture, Martinez declared. He stressed that these changes 
will not alter the basic foundations of Cuban society, forced to 
make its way in a world governed by capitalism. 
  Our economy will continue to be socialist. This means that 
political decisionmaking will be central and politics will 
govern the economy, in that it is subordinated and directed 
towards the achievement of the social objectives of socialism, 
Martinez concluded.

  [Text] Havana, 29 Apr (PL) -- The National Union of Cuban 
Lawyers [UNJC] has demanded an end to the harassment in Miami of 
Cuban-born lawyer Magda Montiel, who is being harassed because 
she attended a meeting between the government and emigrants held 
in Havana. 
  "To witness a crime in silence is to commit a crime," Jose 
Peraza Chapeau, member of the National Executive Bureau of the 
UNJC, told PRENSA LATINA. Peraza Chapeau was speaking on behalf 
of lawyers, judges, district prosecutors, notary publics, legal 
counselors, and other UNJC members. 
  We demand her (Madga Montiel's) protection and the 
punishment, according to the law, of those who are violating her 
rights, states the text of a statement made available by Peraza 
Chapeau. 
  Montiel is being persecuted by groups of right-wing Cubans 
opposed to any normalization of relations with the island since 
she returned to Miami after attending "The Nation and the 
Emigrants" conference held last weekend at the initiative of the 
Cuban Foreign Ministry. 
  The anger of those groups opposed to any understanding with 
the Cuban Government was unleashed after a video showing the 
lawyer speaking with President Fidel Castro was shown on a Miami 
television station. The Cuban leader hosted a reception last 
Sunday for approximately 200 Cubans living in some 30 countries 
who traveled to Havana. 
  In statements to a Cuban radio station, Montiel said she 
felt 
like a prisoner, persecuted, and was forced to ask for police 
protection because of the endless number of anonymous 
threatening telephone calls and bomb threats at her office and 
her home. 
  In the UNJC's opinion, "U.S. authorities are obligated not 
only to give Montiel protection but also to take strong actions 
against the criminals who are threatening her, her children, and 
other family members, because the crime of threatening someone's 
life is covered in all modern legislation." 
  Likewise, the UNJC described as abnormal and highly unusual 
the fact that Cuban emigrant groups can attack and intimidate a 
U.S. citizen (although of Cuban origin) in her own country. 
"They are trampling on a U.S. citizen's rights in U.S. 
territory," Peraza Chapeau told PRENSA LATINA. 
  "Once again the concept of liberty is waved before us and 
juxtaposed with the negation of the sacred right to have one's 
own criteria and to fight for understanding and brotherhood 
between persons of goodwill," the jurist concluded.

  [Text] Havana, 28 Apr (PL) -- Vice Foreign Relations 
Minister Isabel Allende today said the harassment of Cuban 
lawyer Magda Montiel for attending The Nation and The Emigrants 
Conference in Havana is "totally irrational." 
  In exclusive statements given to a national television 
newscast, Allende said: "These actions warrant only repudiation, 
which is the only word I can use, because I see no reason to 
harass Magda Montiel in this manner." 
  She said this treatment is unbefitting behavior for 
civilized 
and normal human beings, adding that such treatment will fail to 
eclipse the results of "The Nation and the Emigrants" 
Conference, which took place on 23 and 24 April, thanks to local 
authority initiatives. 
  Allende pointed out: "I personally think such behavior can 
in 
no way prevent what was accomplished in the conference from 
materializing; I believe this conduct will shadow those who 
behave in such a manner." 
  Montiel and other citizens of Cuban origin who live abroad, 
mainly in the United States, are the target of aggression and 
harassment by extreme rightists in exile who oppose the renewal 
of relations between the island and its expatriate nationals. 
  The harassment of Montiel, an American citizen and former 
congressional candidate for the Republican Party, began upon her 
return from Havana, because Miami television stations aired 
footage showing Montiel talking with President Fidel Castro 
during a reception he held for conference attendees. 
  Isabel Allende recalled that members of the emigrant 
community, whom she called annexionist [anexionista] emigrants, 
tried to obstruct the Havana conference, which had been 
requested on many occasions by Cuban nationals living in many 
other countries.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article for PRENSA LATINA by Javier Rodriquez: </F>
"Cuba: The Permanence of a Conference"] 
  [Text] "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference recently 
held in Havana united officials, intellectuals, and analysts 
with more than 200 Cuban emigrants, and achieved its greatest 
accomplishment in a common determination: the consensus on the 
need to maintain contacts until their relations are totally 
normal. 
  Trapped in the web of the Cuban-U.S. dispute, used by 
several 
U.S. Administrations in their campaigns against the island, the 
emigrants witnessed in the past decades how their relations with 
their country of origin have became tangled and have felt an 
isolation that goes beyond the family circle. 
  The conference, convoked by the Cuban Foreign Ministry, also 
had the virtue of revealing the existence of groups of nationals 
who are located in dozens of countries on several continents, 
even though, due to its geographic proximity and that it is a 
historic path, emigrants have always headed for the United 
States as their first choice. 
  The people present at the conference held a wide range of 
political and ideological positions. They, however, concurred 
in rejecting Washington's economic and commercial blockade of 
Cuba. 
  The main topic of the previously agreed agenda was 
emigration 
regulations. The level of information, however, offered to the 
participants with regard to the country's economic, 
institutional, and cultural situation amply exceeded rigid 
models or undesired exclusions. 
  Four special interventions introduced very important 
explanations of further bilateral relations and also served to 
specify the level of participation the emigrants can have in the 
life and daily business of their own country. 
  Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government (parliament,) exhaustively explained, not 
only the operation of that government body, but also the truly 
participative nature of Cuba's current democratic system. 
  As an example, Alarcon described the people's recent debates 
on measures to reorganize the country's finances. He rejected 
the adoption of multiparty politics due to its divisive nature 
and the damage it could cause to the unity of the population in 
such difficult times. 
  Of great interest to all, according to what was said by 
several of the guests, was the panorama of Cuban cultural life 
portrayed by Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and 
Artists (UNEAC). Prieto called for maintaining Cuban culture as 
the central theme in every work, whether it belongs to an 
emigrant or not. 
  Vice President Carlos Lage examined the situation of the 
Cuban economy and said the efforts being made by the entire 
population, which can also include those who live abroad, will 
give Cuba the possibility of surmounting the crisis triggered by 
the U.S. blockade and the disappearance of the eastern European 
socialist bloc. 
  It fell on Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to announce the 
package of measures dictated by the government in its wish to 
contribute decisively to the normalization of ties with the 
emigrants, which is desired by all. 
  Truthfully, the measures corresponded, in some cases, to 
requests that had already been made by the guests. Robaina's 
announcement was received enthusiastically by the plenary. 
  The creation of a special department in the Foreign Ministry 
to handle emigration affairs, the authorization to allow 
emigrants' children to enroll in Cuban universities, and the 
elimination of the clause that sets five years as the minimum 
period between visits to Cuba by those who reside abroad were 
some of the measures. Also, the revocation of the requirement 
that those who come to visit relatives pay for a hotel room, the 
possibility of investing in sectors that have been earmarked as 
a priority by the Cuban Government, and the printing of a 
publication addressed to the emigrants abroad, completed the 
announcement. The main breakthrough, however, came just a few 
hours after President Fidel Castro received the conference 
participants at the Palace of the Revolution. 
  The participants met directly with parliamentarians to study 
the draft citizenship bill, with youth and women leaders, and 
later with the UNEAC board to study other levels of future 
participation. Those were the first steps in consolidating the 
endeavor that started with the conference. 
  The positive climate, which was witnessed by more than 150 
domestic and foreign journalists, was present in the opinions 
expressed by many of the participants in the conference, 
including those who, possessing a political position different 
to that of the Cuban Government, sought to contribute to the 
common effort. 
  Several analysts and media representatives have pointed out 
that confronted with such a reality, the attacks of the ultra 
conservative groups living in the United States turned out to be 
totally futile.

  [Text] Havana, 29 Apr (PL) -- Today, Zambian President 
Frederick Chiluba and his delegation travelled to the eastern 
city of Santiago de Cuba continuing his official and friendly 
visit to this nation. The Zambian head of state, whom his Cuban 
counterpart, Fidel Castro, invited to the island, will meet here 
with Zambian students majoring in many subjects. 
  Some 43 students from the African nation are studying in 
Cuba 
at university centers in the Provinces of Camaguey, Santiago de 
Cuba, and Villa Clara, and in the nickel-producing Moa 
Municipality. In the last 10 years, about 79 Zambian students 
graduated from college, and six finished their technical studies. 
  Chiluba has contemplated the possibility of strengthening 
bilateral cooperation in activities related to the sugar 
industry, agriculture, public health, and the pharmaceutical 
industry. One of the issues he analyzed during his stay in 
Santiago de Cuba is the ratification of an agreement on having 
Cuban technicians build a sugar mill in Zambia financed by 
Lusaka. 
  The guest and his delegation visited such centers of 
economic 
and scientific interest as the Carlos J. Finlay Biotechnology 
Institute and the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital, one of the most 
important hospitals on the island. They also visited an 
agricultural cooperative in western Havana Province and the 
Mario Munoz Sugar Mill, located in Los Arabos Municipality, in 
Matanzas Province. 
  President Chiluba, 51, is the leader of the Movement for 
Multiparty Democracy (MMD), winner of the 31 October 1991 
elections, and an heir of Kenneth Kaunda. 
  Zambia, which has an area of 174,000 [figure as received] 
square km, is the world's third largest producer and largest 
exporter of copper. The country has other resources such as 
precious and semi-precious stones, ferrous and non-ferrous 
minerals, and tobacco.

  [Text] Havana, 27 Apr (PL) -- Zambian President Frederick 
Chiluba visited places of economic and social interest in Cuba 
today to strengthen bilateral cooperation, he said. The 
president, on an official and friendly visit to our nation upon 
invitation from his Cuban counterpart, Fidel Castro, visited an 
agricultural cooperative in western Havana Province and 
"Hermanos Ameijeiras" Hospital, one of the country's most 
important. Cuban Health Ministry sources said 22 Cuban 
specialists render their services in that southern Africa 
nation, and we hope to increase that number. 
  The Zambian Government has stated its interest in reaching 
cooperation agreements in the sugar industry and its 
derivatives, the pharmaceutical industry, and the public health 
and sports sectors. 
  Local Foreign Ministry sources have announced plans for the 
construction of a sugar refinery by Cuban technicians, and 
Lusaka will finance all the operations. The exchange of trainers 
in several sport disciplines, such as boxing, soccer, and 
baseball, is also expected. 
  Chiluba was awarded the "Jose Marti" national order, the 
highest distinction granted by the Cuban Government, and he held 
official conversations with Fidel Castro, during which they 
discussed issues dealing with current international politics and 
the situation in Angola. 
  The Zambian delegation will leave for Varadero Beach, 
approximately 100 km east of the capital, tomorrow and will 
travel next Friday to the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba, 
where many young people from this African nation study.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Colonel Desire Bouterse, </F>
National Democratic Party leader in New Ground near Paramaribo; 
date not given: "Presidential Candidate Bouterse: `In Five 
Years, I Will Lay the Foundation Here for a Singapore'" -- first 
two paragraphs are ELSEVIER introduction] 
  [Excerpts] The talk took place on "New Ground," a neglected 
former Netherlands plantation, and a two-hour trip from 
Paramaribo over the Commewijne. This is where Desire (Desi) 
Delano Bouterse (48), who until 31 January of 1993 was the Army 
commander, spends a lot of time. The greeting is a bit stiff. 
This is a different Bouterse from the one at a meeting four 
years ago at the Het Park club in Fort Zeelandia, which at that 
time was the military headquarters which had a strong hand in 
Suriname's affairs of state. Back then he was a colonel, 
starched in his faultless uniform; now he is a country dweller 
in boots, shorts, and T-shirt. He has put on some weight. 
  Bouterse, the current leader of the National Democratic 
Party 
(NDP), sits down on a crude wooden bench underneath a tree. 
[passage omitted] 
  [ELSEVIER] Are things not going well with the Army? 
  [Bouterse] An army is a part of the community. At this time, 
the Surinamese community is showing all the signs of chaos. As 
the Army is a part of the unity, it too is showing the signs. 
In addition, it is being systematically cut back and stripped. 
Gorre is not in a good enough position to offer any resistance 
to this. For this reason, there is grumbling among military men. 
  [ELSEVIER] Would you happen to know any people who would be 
better in the post of Army leader? 
  [Bouterse] Ceder would be good. I am also thinking of 
Boerenveen, Christopher, and Slijngaard (Bouterse gives some 
names of high-ranking officers, all of whom have advisory staff 
functions in the entourage of President Venetiaan or Defense 
Minister Gilds). I hope that my naming these people will not 
have any consequences for them. 
  [ELSEVIER] Is the Army still in a position to carry out a 
coup? 
  [Bouterse] (Laughing) I do not think so. And I do not hope 
so, either. We have had a certain amount of developments in 
Suriname: two Army coups. I think that this was quite enough 
for the safe transformation of the young Republic. It has had 
its historic meaning. In the end, the political work must be 
left up to the politicians. We had already implemented this 
evolution. Now, the Army is being rapidly detached from 
politics, although here in Suriname each political party is 
still trying to have an influence on the Army. [passage omitted] 
  [ELSEVIER] How are things going with the NDP? Is it right to 
say that you would be prepared to cooperate with others in order 
to come up with a national approach? 
  [Bouterse] We definitely need that. There is a difference 
between podium talk and your responsibility. Our country is in 
a very serious situation and is going through a bad time. 
Economically, there is a wide open, chaotic situation. With 
every passing day, the people are finding it harder to make ends 
meet. President Venetiaan and the Front are governing on an ad 
hoc basis, letting things take their own course. People no 
longer believe in him. He offers no prospects. The solution 
lies in early elections. I think our followers are growing. We 
are prepared for full or partial power. 
  [ELSEVIER] What do you mean full? 
  [Bouterse] If we get the majority, if not, then we will work 
together with those people who accept a national approach, along 
the lines of a consensus model. 
  [ELSEVIER] What is the core of this contribution? 
  [Bouterse] People must be put back to work in this country. 
Authority and discipline must return. There must be a slightly 
military approach, with a slightly adjusted model of democracy. 
There should be a parliament, but not endless waffling. Let the 
representatives of the people meet every three months to discuss 
legislation, but do not let them mess around with plans that are 
never implemented. That makes me resentful. If they leave me 
in peace, then within five years, I will lay a foundation for a 
new Singapore here on this land, with these people, and with all 
the resources. We have wood and gold, but not yet the know-how 
and the money to use it for development. Other countries do. 
The thing to do now is to have the inventiveness to combine 
national interests with international interests, in an open 
manner, without engaging in backhanded methods, through a 
consensus. 
  [ELSEVIER] What stands in the way of this consensus? 
  [Bouterse] One condition is to have a national 
reconciliation. There are still a lot of hard feelings. The 
coups, the counter-coups: We must draw a line under all of 
this. One man says: "You killed my family." And the other man 
says: "You locked me up." We have black pages in our history, 
but if we keep looking back, then we will keep attacking each 
other. [passage omitted] 
  [ELSEVIER] People are saying that you want to become 
president? 
  [Bouterse] What shall I say? Everyone has been expecting for 
a little while that, given half a chance, Bouterse would become 
the new president. For me, however, this is not an end in 
itself. If I had wanted that, I could have done that for a long 
time. If the voters want it and the community requests it, then 
I will not shirk that responsibility. If I obtain political 
power, however, then people will know that it will call for a 
lot of hard work. That costs votes. I am not going to tolerate 
the fact that you have to wait two hours for passport control at 
the airport, that the streets are in shambles, that people do 
not show up for work, and things like that. 
  [ELSEVIER] Will you cooperate with the Netherlands as a 
friendly nation? 
  [Bouterse] Politics is a tough business, one in which there 
is no room for hard feelings. The history is there. We were a 
colony of the Netherlands; hundreds of thousands of Surinamers 
live in the Netherlands; and we have an international treaty. 
Of course, it is up to the Netherlands to decide whether it 
wants to cooperate with a Bouterse government. If not, then I 
am not going to go whining to The Hague. But we are looking for 
other countries to cooperate with.

  [Text] Madrid, 3 May (EFE) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
has said, "The aggression the Cuban people have suffered because 
of the U.S. embargo has been an encouragement for them." 
  In an interview published in the latest issue of the Spanish 
weekly LA TRIBUNA, the Cuban leader said: "The blockade has 
caused billions of dollars in losses to our country's economy. 
We estimate them at $10 billion." 
  Castro said, "If we have been able to resist for 35 years, 
we 
can certainly resist another 25," adding, "The United States and 
the industrialized countries have always dictated economic and 
trade policy to poor countries." 
  The revolutionary leader said he expects no significant 
change in U.S. policy toward Cuba, because "it has preferred to 
continue harassing the island with an economic boycott that in 
no way benefits the United States but, rather, seriously hurts 
Cuba's civilian population." 
  Castro said he believes "an end to the blockade would only 
help Cuba in terms of medical equipment and the pharmaceutical 
industry," because "the United States has increasingly less to 
offer Cuba." 
  As for payment of the foreign debt, the Cuban president 
said, 
"The debt should be forgiven because this would benefit the 
United States, international trade, and all other countries." He 
added, "I am certain that the U.S. foreign debt is larger than 
that of all Latin American countries put together." 
  Fidel Castro also said, "A nearly unanimous consensus is 
building on the issue of the foreign debt and the impossibility 
of paying it, particularly in terms of the unjust and 
intolerable demands imposed on Third World countries by 
organizations such as the IMF and U.S. banks." 
  The Cuban leader, 67, said he has no worries about his 
country's fate after he departs from the presidency because 
there are "many people prepared to ensure continuity in our 
country, a country that is developing day by day through the 
efforts of genuine Cubans."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Relations Ministry </F>
spokesman Miguel Alfonso by Barbara Bethancourt on 3 May; place 
not given; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Bethancourt] The U.S. Government has prevented 
Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina from participating in 
a television program to explain the island's current situation. 
Ted Turner, TBS [Turner Broadcasting System] president, invited 
Robaina to Atlanta to attend the show. Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Miguel Alfonso, please give us your report on the 
situation: 
  [Alfonso] As I said earlier, we received the agenda listing 
those invited on 7 March. The Atlanta conference was supposed 
to take place 1-5 May in Atlanta. As you know, we must forward a 
formal note to request a U.S. visa. The Foreign Ministry, on 4 
April, 25 days before Robaina's scheduled trip to Atlanta, sent 
the formal note. As you know, the U.S. Interests Section in 
Havana has established a certain number of days to submit an 
application prior to granting such a visa and those 25 days more 
than covered this restriction. The note containing pertinent 
information was delivered, and we began waiting to see whether 
or not the visa would be granted. 
  Cuban authorities learned that TBS and CNN officials had 
contacted the relevant authorities in the State Department. 
According to the information we have, TBS officials believed the 
visa would be granted. Time went by, and, as of 28 April, the 
day before Robaina was scheduled to leave for Atlanta, we had 
received no answer from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, 
which, as you know, is part of the Swiss Embassy in Cuba. 
  In view of this situation, the Foreign Ministry decided to 
withdraw the passports from the U.S. Interests Section because 
it had become impossible to schedule the trip. This is because 
Robaina was supposed to leave for Atlanta the next day. 
  In short, this is a situation I want you, the media, to 
examine. The media cannot overlook the fact that it was made 
impossible for a figure such as Robaina to speak before an 
important forum and have access to the international media to 
discuss Cuba's position. Robaina and a number of Cuban 
authorities have pursued this policy on a regular basis. I 
repeat, the media cannot ignore the fact that it is hard to 
believe all of this talk about freedom of thought in light of 
Robaina's inability to obtain an entry visa to attend an 
important television forum. 
  As you can see, there is no correlation between all of those 
ideas espoused by the U.S. Government, which claims to advocate 
freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, and the free flow of 
ideas, and this inability of such an important Cuban 
personality, like the foreign minister, to attend this forum for 
exchanging ideas because other people in attendance may have 
opinions that differ from Robaina's. This event was an ideal 
venue for exchanging ideas because we always believe that by 
exchanging ideas, we can better understand the opinions of 
others. This is the statement I have for you. 
  [Bethancourt] Did you receive any reply after you withdrew 
the passports? 
  [Alfonso] It was very interesting. As I already said, our 
authorities decided hours before Robaina's departure that there 
was no chance he would be able to make the trip. Therefore, the 
passports were withdrawn, and the very next day, 29 April, 
Secret Service agents from the State Department [as heard] went 
to our Interests Section in Washington, D.C., to coordinate ways 
to ensure Minister Robaina's safety during his visit to the 
United States. 
  This situation indeed deserves to be criticized, because as 
far as I know, communications between Havana and Washington were 
not interrupted on 28 April. This visit in Washington by Secret 
Service agents took place after we withdrew the passports the 
day before. Again, these agents went there the following day to 
coordinate ways to secure the personal safety of the Cuban 
foreign minister. There you have it. This is the only reply we 
have received. 
  [Bethancourt] Have you received any word from the U.S. 
Interests Section in Havana? 
  [Alfonso] We have received no reply or explanation 
whatsoever. The visa was not granted, considering we decided to 
withdraw the passports from the hands of the U.S. authorities in 
Havana. 
  [Bethancourt] We just heard Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Miguel 
Alfonso explain the reasons why Minister Robaina will not attend 
a television show he had been invited to in the United States in 
Atlanta.

  [Text] Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio 
arrived this afternoon in Havana at the invitation of Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez. Foreign Minister Sanin is 
accompanied by other officials from the Colombian Foreign 
Ministry and Government. 
  The goal of the two-day visit is to sign an education accord 
on 4 May and to ratify the work program of the Cuba-Colombia 
joint commission. The minister will also present a donation of 
books to the Jose Marti National Library, visit Casa de las 
Americas, and meet with Carlos Lage, member of the Politburo and 
vice president of the Council of State. 
  Minister Sanin held high-level talks this afternoon at the 
Cuban Foreign Ministry where she met for more than an hour with 
Foreign Minister Robaina and several Cuban vice foreign 
ministers in a relaxed and congenial atmosphere. 
  Regarding the condition of ties between Cuba and Colombia, 
Minister Sanin pointed out upon her arrival at Jose Marti 
International Airport that these were exceptionally healthy and 
were developing quite well in a climate of mutual respect, 
unhurriedly, and with respect for the sovereignty and decisions 
of each nation. 
  Regarding an issue of great importance for Cuba, the oil 
issue, which has caused numerous problems and impaired ties 
between Cuba and Colombia, Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin stated: 
  [Begin Sanin recording] Colombia sells oil to Cuba without 
reservation so long as Cuba pays according to the terms and 
conditions established by Colombia. If Cuba can meet the 
Colombian conditions, we have no problem selling it. We are 
therefore discussing credit and terms. [end recording]

  [Text] At the International Small Island States Conference 
being held in Barbados, the Caribbean group of Non-Governmental 
Organizations [NGO] has advocated promoting alternative 
development strategies as well as environmental education. The 
proposals of the Caribbean organizations include giving 
nongovernmental groups a voice in the decision-making process 
regarding sustainable development, and the ratification of 
Accord 169 of the International Labor Organization on the rights 
of indigenous peoples. 
  Other proposals include restructuring military budgets to 
allocate those resources to social services and environmental 
protection. The Caribbean group of Non-Governmental 
Organizations, which is holding sessions parallel to the Small 
Island State Conference, by consensus appointed the Cuban 
delegate as its spokesman.

country. It allowed everyone to acknowledge that it [words 
indistinct]. As it says in the gospel, all that is done on the 
sly, under cover, and in darkness will show up clearly in broad 
daylight. 
  All that blackmail [as heard] is aimed at influencing the 
perspective of the revolutionary movement in the country. It is 
the true means (?to help) the Haitian people rid itself of the 
terrorist Army. [words indistinct] one fights, one cries 
victory. Do not worry. The only solution is revolution. Down 
with the drug-dealing criminal Army! Down with Cedras' Army of 
zenglendos [Macoute thugs]! Down with the bloodthirsty 
U.S.-subjugated Army! Up with a people's and revolutionary Army 
in the country!

  [Text] The National Coalition condemns the new U.S. 
position on the Haitian crisis. The organization led by Carl 
Denis and Gerard Bissainthe denounces the presence of a U.S. 
warship in Haitian waters on 2 May. Let us listen to Carl Denis: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Reporter Francois] Carl Denis, 
you are a leader of an organization that stands for the defense 
of Haiti's national sovereignty. We noticed a statement by the 
White House today: that no option is excluded in the case of 
Haiti, not even the military option. How do you interpret such a 
statement? 
  [Denis] We interpret it as the United States having decided 
that in the case of a small country, particularly a small black 
country, it can afford to make mistakes it cannot make in other 
countries. No matter how strong it wishes to be, it cannot go 
into Bosnia-Herzegovina because it knows that it will be 
defeated. It also knows that it cannot go into Rwanda because 
they would not [word indistinct] because there, the armies are 
stronger. We think that President Clinton and the White House 
are acting thoughtlessly toward Haiti. We are indignant that 
following those statements, a U.S. warship is at less than 2,000 
miles [as heard] from our shores. The ship was there at 1000 
this morning. What did it come to do? It came to bring a message 
to our legislators so they do not apply articles of the 
Constitution that the legislators would like to adopt. Thus, 
instead of -- as the U.S. Government says -- it being the 
[Haitian] military who are putting pressure on our parliament, I 
see instead that it is the U.S. military putting pressure on our 
parliament so that [the legislators] do not work the way they 
should. We are very indignant about that. 
  [Francois] You therefore condemn all these actions? 
  [Denis] We strongly condemn the fact that Washington has 
stuck its nose into Haiti's affairs. We wish it would respect 
other countries, which are not its equal, but which have their 
own sovereignty, their own tradition. There was no reason for 
the crisis to have lasted so long had it not been for the 
harmful action of the international community. Finally, when you 
look carefully, the United States gives us two options: either 
we die under the commercial and economic sanctions that they 
impose on us, or they force us to accept a government that will 
kill us itself. You get to realize that the United States cannot 
be a friend to Haiti. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The international civilian mission sent a team 
of observers to Gonaives on 27 and 28 April to investigate the 
claim that numerous people had been killed by the Army in the 
Raboteau neighborhood. According to the military authorities in 
the city, the events were caused by a group of terrorists led by 
Arnault Mtayer, also known as "The Cuban" and an Aristide 
sympathizer. He was reported to have attacked the Raboteau 
outpost on 22 April to rouse the population to solidarity with 
the rebels of Borgne. These attacks reportedly forced the Armed 
to retaliate and to pursue the group of terrorists who were 
attempting to escape by sea aboard small craft. Military 
authorities pointed out that six persons died during the 
operation. 
  The mission has not been able to collect convincing 
testimony 
or evidence to corroborate the Armed Forces officials' version 
of the story. According to numerous pieces of information that 
agree, it seems that, to the contrary, Army members were at the 
root of the problem. As early as 18 April, two military 
personnel, accompanied by a local leader of the Revolutionary 
Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, fired shots at 
Mr. Mtayer's home, which they subsequently ransacked. They 
arrested his father, Ludovic Mtayer, 65. 
  On 22 April, soldiers in greater numbers invaded Raboteau 
early in the morning. They attacked and plundered about 10 
houses and assaulted their inhabitants before summarily 
executing numerous people, whom they had driven out of their 
homes, onshore and offshore in small boats. The victims 
included travelers. [passage omitted] 
  The mission determined that at least 12 persons had been 
shot 
to death by soldiers wearing tactical unit uniforms. At least 
one witness showed the observers mounds where six to eight 
persons were reportedly buried. According to concurring reports, 
bodies floating in the sea had been washed ashore. Members of 
the Haitian Armed Forces had prevented the families from burying 
them. 
  The observers reported that several people had been injured 
during the military operation and that most of them had gone 
into hiding, preferring to avoid hospital treatment for fear of 
recognition. 
  Finally, it appears that the Roboteau neighborhood, 
especially lower Raboteau, has experienced a massive exodus 
following these events. The civilian mission very energetically 
condemns the slaughter of innocent civilians in Raboteau, the 
extent of which surpasses all other indiscriminate attacks 
committed by elements of the Armed Forces since the arrival of 
the mission in Haiti. It therefore requests that the High 
Command begin a thorough inquiry to establish who was 
responsible for this horrible slaughter.

is alarmed by the numerous acts of violence perpetrated in the 
country. The president of this committee, Deputy Edmonde 
Supplice Beauzile, particularly emphasized the incidents that 
occurred in Borgne and Raboteau. She denounced these acts as 
serious affronts to human rights and launched the idea of 
forming an independent investigation committee to identify the

  [Text] The Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and 
Progress of Haiti, FRAPH, and three other political parties, 
including the Union of Democratic Patriots, the Liaison of 
Democratic Forces, and the Alliance for the Liberation and 
Progress of Haiti took positions. 
  First of all, FRAPH demanded the formation of an ad hoc 
government. The leader of and spokesman for this organization 
convened the legislators to an urgent meeting of the National 
Assembly to fill the executive vacuum before 9 May, the date of 
the closing of the current parliamentary session. Let us listen 
to Emmanuel Constant: 
  [Begin Constant recording] We firmly believe the nation must 
meet in national assembly so the executive vacuum can be filled 
as soon as possible; but in any case, before the parliamentary 
vacuum planned for 9 May. The Haitian nation must be endowed 
with an ad hoc government during this period of crisis, which is 
particularly exceptional. 
  The National Assembly has the duty to adopt a law of 
consensual policy, a sort of guiding plan for a provisional 
government in charge of managing the Haitian crisis, and able to 
integrate development projects using our own resources that will 
be proposed by legislators for their respective constituencies.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de las </F>
Casas, Chiapas; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Santoyo] Special Peace Commissioner Manuel 
Camacho Solis was scheduled to arrive here today, but this did 
not occur. As we reported this morning, the bishop of San 
Cristobal de las Casas reported yesterday that Camacho Solis was 
scheduled to arrive today because of a possible reply from the 
EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] on what could be new 
conditions or new efforts in the second phase of the peace talks. 
  Until now, the only thing we have been told at the 
archdiocese is that Manuel Camacho Solis' arrival has been 
postponed one or two days. His date of arrival has not yet been 
confirmed. Nevertheless, we have been told he will be here in 
the near future. 
  We are now waiting for the fulfillment of what Samuel Ruiz, 
bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, said would be the [word 
indistinct] reply by the EZLN. This is important because, with 
this reply, one might be able to get an idea about what the 
second phase of the dialogue will be like. Indeed, this 
dialogue is near at hand. 
  In another turn of events, in San Cristobal de las Casas, 
the 
nomination of Robledo Rincon as candidate for governor for the 
State of Chiapas has been accepted nonchalantly. This 
appointment is being seen here in a good light because Rincon is 
already a legislator who, as has been pointed out, has worked a 
great deal for the region. Little by little, he has toured the 
entire state and is familiar with its problems. 
  [Announcer Jose Cardenas from the Radio ACIR studios in 
Mexico City] Do you remember that it was none other than Senator 
Robledo Rincon, along with Heraclio Zepeda and -- if I am not 
mistaken -- anthropologist Andres Fabrega, who formed part of 
the first commission created following President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari's instructions on [16-second break in reception] 
conflict with EZLN. By the way, Robledo Rincon was one of the 
people closest to Luis Donaldo Colosio. This commission was to 
find a solution to this problem. This was the initiation of the 
dialogue [25-second break in reception] 
  [Santoyo, in progress] ...remember this because I was a 
witness during this very interesting stage. [26-second break in 
reception] here in Chiapas in favor of the peasants and Indians, 
but that respect for their traditions and customs also had to be 
taken into account. 
  Nevertheless, Senator Rincon indicated that the task was 
going to be very difficult. They were able to do this because, 
during the first days of January when this special commission 
was created, many meetings were held in the conflict zone, as 
well as in most tranquil municipalities. They toured the area 
thoroughly, listening to and trying to understand concerns. 
  I believe Robledo Rincon will base his political platform on 
the information he collected from the Indians and peasants 
during these tours. This will be very important in this state, 
where some politicians and some media have rightly pointed out 
that whoever becomes governor will not necessarily be hitting 
the jackpot. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Daniel Pensamiento] </F>
  [Text] Las Margaritas -- Mexican Army troops have occupied 
the three main access roads to the Lacandona jungle to prevent 
the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] from getting 
provisions into this region. Military personnel have set up 
heavy artillery and have dug ditches to prepare for and bolster 
surveillance in this zone. 
  Yesterday, military forces dismantled El Encanto camp and 
set 
up two checkpoints in the communities of Progreso and Gabino 
Vasquez, areas in which the Zapatists presumably obtain 
provisions and medicines. The Army also set up checkpoints 
along the roads leading to Progreso, Gabino Vasquez, and El 
Yalcob, which are thought to be the three main access roads into 
the Lacandona region. The Army still has no control over the 
Guadalupe Tepeyac buffer zone. 
  According to residents in the area, the military has been 
conducting ground-based reconnaissance missions at night. The 
residents also report that soldiers are restricting nighttime 
movements in the area. 
  Meanwhile, some 40 km away, the EZLN has its own checkpoint 
to limit access to the Lacandona jungle, where its forces have 
been hiding since 12 January when the cease-fire was declared. 
In a tour of this zone by EL NORTE, it was confirmed that the 
military is maintaining a state of alert, although the second 
phase of the negotiations on a possible peace agreement is about 
to begin. As part of the military strategy, the military is 
resurfacing the dirt roads that lead to the three Mexican Army 
checkpoints. 
  One military source pointed out that the troops remain 
restless because there is much movement of EZLN-linked people in 
this zone. He said: "This region is one of the most important 
sources of people for the EZLN, and it has been noticed that 
some of them are lurking around in plainclothes. Therefore, 
uncertainty reigns."

<F P=106> [Article by Roberto Garduno Espinosa] </F>
  [Text] The Attorney General's Office (PGR) has said the 
arrest of Carlos Resendez Bertolousi in Monterrey is one of the 
most important blows dealt to drug trafficking. Resendez was in 
charge of laundering the money the Tamaulipas 
Cartel made by selling drugs. The PGR added that the 
alleged criminal, who is linked to Juan Garcia Abrego, main 
Tamaulipas Cartel leader who is on the loose, was 
sent to the Topo Chico Social Readaptation Center in Nuevo Leon 
State. 
  A group of judicial policemen, led by Horacio Brunt Acosta, 
received a tip on 19 March and arrested Resendez as Raymundo 
Gumaro Garza Sanchez and Eliseo Hernandez, who had $110,000 in 
their possession. The two men said the money came from the sale 
of 50 kg of cocaine owned by Resendez. 
  The PGR based its investigations on reports by U.S. DEA and 
Federal Judicial Police (PJF). These reports indicate the 
following: "Carlos Resendez is a key and essential figure in the 
operational and financial organization owned by Juan Garcia 
Abrego, currently on the loose and alleged author of many 
crimes, including health crimes, arms warehousing, and fraud 
[usurpacion de funciones]. 
  The relationship between the two capos began in 
1982, when Resendez was a Tamaulipas Judicial Police chief. 
Upon meeting Garcia, he offered him and his relatives 
protection. Years later, as he left the Judicial Police ranks, 
Resendez "suddenly" became a prominent businessman in charge of 
a company called Autolineas Mavi, Inc. 
  Two large economic transactions cast a shadow over Resendez. 
On 19 May 1993, he made deposits of up to 5 million new pesos 
in the Banorte Bank, Account No. 1023597771, under the name of 
Nohema Quintanilla, whom the PGR believes is his mistress. The 
second incident was the confiscation of $432,000 from Cornelio 
Herrera and Adriana Castrocerio, who claimed the money belonged 
to Resendez. 
  These reports indicate that the Tamaulipas Cartel, 
in operation for the last 15 years, is a multinational business 
whose tentacles reach into the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, 
El Salvador, and Colombia. In the United States, the cartel 
operates in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, California, Ohio, New 
York, and New Jersey. In Mexico, the criminal organization 
operates in 23 states. In addition, six estates, businesses, 
and companies linked to Resendez have been located. They all 
are under different names. 
<H5>  The Steps of Resendez </H5>
  The PGR also detected the purchase of five 1994 vehicles 
from 
the Country Car Company, whose alleged owner is Garcia Abrego. 
Another case involves the hiring of a "large group of exclusive 
artists," who would presumably perform at his daughter Zulema's 
wedding on 15 May. The PJF learned Resendez introduced Ruben 
Ramirez to Juan Garcia Abrego to ensure that "Ramirez would 
become Garcia's legal representative in charge of recovering 
real estate and personal property owned by the Tamaulipas 
Cartel chief. 
  In late 1993, the PGR captured several cartel members and 
Garcia's henchmen, including Luis Medrano Garcia, Jose Medrano 
De la Rosa, and Adolfo De la Garza, whom the federal government 
will prosecute. Medrano De la Rosa is charged with murder and 
criminal association. 
  Our Monterrey correspondent, David Carrizales, reported that 
when Resendez was presented to the media, he admitted to being a 
friend of Garcia Abrego's, but said he is innocent of the drug 
trafficking charges. He added he is the victim of a vendetta by 
Eduardo Valle, private secretary of Attorney General Diego 
Valades Rios. Resendez is in the custody of the 6th Topo Chico 
District Court. Two arrest warrants on two associates of Garcia 
Abrego's are still pending.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Although new political forces have emerged, not one 
of them has been able to surpass expectations. According to 
last week's poll, the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] 
continues to be the foremost political force, while the PRD 
[Party of the Democratic Revolution] and the PAN [National 
Action Party] remain in second and third place, respectively. 
  ESTE PAIS, a monthly magazine run by journalist and 
political 
expert Federico Reyes Heroles, published the results of the 
latest weekly poll conducted in the cities of Tijuana, Mexico, 
Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Puebla. Some 320 people over the age 
of 18 were asked for whom were they going to vote. The results 
of the poll are as follows: the PRI's Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de 
Leon received 34 percent of the votes; the PRD's Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas received about 15 percent, much lower than what he 
received in mid-March; and the PAN's Diego Fernandez de Cevallos 
received about 12 percent. 
  The ESTE PAIS poll showed that the number of undecided 
voters 
is about the same as the number of Zedillo's voters; that is, 
undecided voters amount to about 33 percent. There could be 
many surprises to come. Other candidates garnered less than 5 
percent of the votes. As I say other candidates, I am talking 
about the ill-named second-rate parties. In short, this is the 
current political scene.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 3 May. 
  Marco Antonio Slim Domit, director of the leading financial 
group Segumex-Inbursa, has said the implementation of NAFTA will 
result in growth in the assembly plant industry. He said "30 
new industries have already opened this year, and it is expected 
140 other plants will open before the end of the year." This 
represents a 19.2-percent increase over 1993. 
  Industrial specialist John Christman has reported the 
industry "could be worth approximately $28.5 billion" by 
December. The big winners, he added, "will be the auto 
industry, textiles, and garments," the exports of which are 
expected to hit $20 billion by 1999. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO 
in Spanish 26 April 94 p 22) 
  Carlos Eduardo Represas, president of the Private Sector 
Economic Studies Center, has said economic growth and investment 
projects for 1994 have already been affected by interest rate 
increases and pressure on exchange rates. Following his 
participation in a seminar entitled Mexican Industrial Policy, 
he proposed the government devise a number of economic, social, 
and political measures aimed at restoring confidence. Represas 
denied, however, the current conditions forecast a drastic drop 
in the currency exchange rate. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in 
Spanish 27 April 94 pp 1, 31) 
  Herminio Blanco, under secretary for international trade 
negotiations of the Commerce and Industrial Development 
Secretariat, Secofi, has reported Mexican exports to the United 
States increased 23 percent during the first quarter of 1994. 
This, he said, "is a result of NAFTA." The assembly industry, 
for its part, increased exports by 28 percent during the same 
period. Blanco said Mexico deems workers' rights and the 
environment to be very important issues, but "we will never 
accept their being used for the imposition of measures for 
commercial protectionism." (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 
27 April 94 p 22) 
  Secofi Secretary Jaime Serra Puche has said foreign 
investments reached $5.22 billion during the first quarter of 
1994, 89 percent higher than the same period in 1993. During an 
impromptu news conference following his participation at the 
seminar on Mexican Industrial Policy, he said oil exports were 
20 percent higher in March and could reach 25 percent under 
NAFTA. He reported, however, foreign investment in general 
dropped approximately 50 percent in March with regard to January 
1994. While U.S. imports from other countries rose 11 percent, 
imports from Mexico grew twice as much. Serra Puche concluded 
generally speaking, "implementation of NAFTA and lower import 
tariffs have produced encouraging results for the country." 
(Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 7) 
  Imports of computer technology increased 28 percent, 
following the implementation of NAFTA and the lifting of trade 
tariffs. Mexican computer and software exports, meanwhile, are 
relatively low in comparison to imports. Industrial leader 
Antonio Medina Mora said the industry will require more 
financial support to reach its goals. Projections for 1995, 
under the present free trade market conditions, show $2 billion 
in sales. Software is expected to grow by 28 percent, services 
by 18.9 percent, and hardware by 16.6 percent. (Mexico City EL 
FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 26) 
  The financial group Asemex-Banpais has stated $4.95 billion 
was transferred out of the country during March. He added 
international reserves dropped to $24 billion compared to the 
$29 billion available in January and February. The main routes 
were through the Mexican stock market, with 36.24 percent of the 
total, and the currency exchange market, with 34.69 percent. 
Banking notes, negotiable documents, and open shares followed. 
The group noted, however, that "even if all economic agents 
were to trade in their pesos for dollars, the reserves would 
still be sufficient to cover the demand;" therefore, the 
document concludes, "there is no call for a devaluation of the 
peso." (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 17) 
  The Bank of Mexico has reported loans granted to the 
manufacturing sector dropped 3.5 percent during the first month 
of the year. The bank granted loans totaling 60.43 billion 
pesos in December 1993. That amount dropped to 58.17 billion 
pesos in January 1994; this, the report states, affected other 
areas such as insurance, accounting services, rentals, and other 
related activities. Credit requests from these fields dropped 
proportionally. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 
19) 
  The government and private sector's firm control over labor 
unions has prevented Mexican workers from freely and 
democratically organizing unions, while 5 to 6 million people 
are unemployed, and approximately 12 million have part-time 
jobs. This information was disclosed by the Authentic Labor 
Front, FAT, and corroborated by the Confederation of Mexican 
Workers (CTM). Furthermore, according to FAT, workers' buying 
power has deteriorated, and their meager participation in 
nongovernment unions proves there is a lack of freedom in that 
respect. (Paris AFP in Spanish 0943 GMT 28 April 94) 
  The National Chamber of Electrical Appliance Manufacturers 
[Caname] has disclosed the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) 
has substantially reduced its local acquisitions to control its 
budget and reduce its foreign loans, which dropped from 2.8 
billion new pesos in 1991 to 1.4 billion pesos in 1992 and 1.2 
billion pesos in 1993. Caname says that due to the problems 
that emerged with the implementation of NAFTA early this year, 
the CFE's local purchases totaled 132 million pesos, which is an 
insignificant figure. Meanwhile, CFE imports in 1993 totaled 
453 million pesos, down from 665 million pesos in 1992. (Mexico 
City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 April 94 p 32) 
  The Mexican Telephone System (Telmex) has reported the loss 
of 718.75 million pesos during the first quarter of 1994 due to 
fluctuations in the exchange rate and a substantial increase in 
interest rates in the United States over the past few months. 
In its quarterly report, the company has disclosed its net 
profits during the same period amounted to 1.850 billion pesos 
(approximately $560 million), 14.3 percent less than it earned 
in 1993. An EL FINANCIERO study indicates investors recovered 
some of their confidence, but the uncertainty of the past few 
months still had an effect; nevertheless, Telmex sales, up until 
March, totaled 6.630 billion pesos (approximately $2.09 
billion), 13 percent more than during the same period in 1993. 
(Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 April 94 p 10) 
  A report by the Indosuez Bank presents Telmex as the most 
attractive telecommunications company on the Latin American 
market. Indosuez says compared to other Latin American telephone 
companies in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Peru, Telmex 
offers the best value. The comparison was based on the 
macroeconomic conditions of each country, the possibilities for 
growth, corporate efficiency, debt, and the flow of funds. The 
purchase of Telmex shares was strongly recommended in the report 
because the company is rapidly replacing its old lines with 
digital equipment. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 
April 94 p 10) 
  In an immediate response to the reduction of treasury bond 
interest rates, the Mexican stock market closed with an increase 
for the second consecutive day, thus accumulating a two-day 
advance of 6.38 percent. On 27 April, the index of prices and 
quotations increased 48.65 points, 2.13 percent, closing at 
2,332 points and 78 trading units. Financial analysts have said 
the stock market is reacting favorably to the agreements signed 
by the economic secretaries and ministers of Mexico, Canada, and 
the United States to strengthen the currency. (Mexico City 
Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 28 April) 
  The Mexican Network of Action In Response to Free Trade has 
said the first quarter of NAFTA negatively affected Mexico. The 
agricultural and forestal sectors suffered adverse economic 
effects, the country's trade deficit increased by 20 percent, 
and there was an unexpected increase in imports of consumer 
goods. The group adds complaints of labor rights violations 
were also filed at the NAFTA Labor Commission based in Dallas. 
Network representative Bertha Lujan says her organization will 
demand the renegotiation of NAFTA. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in 
Spanish 29 April 94 p 59) 
  Today during a meeting with the leaders of small- and 
medium-sized businesses in Mexico City, Commerce and Industrial 
Development Secretary Jaime Serra Puche said Mexico's exports to 
the United States increased 22 percent during the first two 
months of 1994. He explained this is due to NAFTA and is very 
encouraging for Mexico. Serra Puche said that during the first 
quarter of 1994, foreign investment in Mexico amounted to $5.2 
billion, which will increase as Mexico increases its products on 
foreign markets. He added Mexico intends to strengthen trade 
with the Central American nations. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in 
Spanish 29 April 94 p 57) 
  A report by the Presidency of the republic indicates that 
thanks to NAFTA, nonoil exports increased during the first 
quarter of 1994, achieving a growth rate of 23.9 percent. 
Imports increased overall by 19.7 percent, surpassing overall 
exports, which increased by 17.5 percent. The report indicates 
the effect of releasing tariffs was reflected in the growth of 
bilateral trade with the United States, which increased 22.4 
percent, and trade with Canada, which increased 48.5 percent. 
Meanwhile, nonoil agricultural exports in January and February 
surpassed those of the same period in 1993 by $1.4 billion.

1993. Exports to the European Union increased by 20 percent, 
and exports to Central America, Costa Rica's third-largest 
trading partner, increased by more than 7 percent higher than

  [Text] San Salvador, 3 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Humberto 
Corado, Salvadoran defense and public security minister, said 
the second phase of Operation Fuertes Caminos, conducted jointly 
with the U.S. Army, could be suspended should legal action 
materialize. The minister added that President Alfredo Cristiani 
and the Armed Forces will accept a Supreme Court of Justice 
(CSJ) decision should it rule that the presence of U.S. troops 
in the country indeed violates the Constitution. 
  The first phase of Operation Fuertes Caminos began in August 
1993, but the Bar Association of El Salvador filed a suit in the 
CSJ, claiming the joint operation was unconstitutional because 
the presence of U.S. troops violates the Constitution. 
  The first phase of the operation ended in December 1993, but 
the CSJ has yet to make a decision. The second phase began on 1 
May with the presence of 400 soldiers -- U.S. engineers -- and a 
similar number of Salvadoran military personnel. 
  Official sources said Fuertes Caminos is designed to 
construct a number of structures, including schools, roads, and 
water wells, structures that will benefit about 50,000 
Salvadorans who live in rural areas. The projects are being 
carried out in the hamlets of Miraflores and San Juan Nonualco, 
La Paz Department, 5 km west of San Salvador. 
  The defense minister added that the projects will continue 
for as long as the CSJ fails to issue a ruling. The projects 
are scheduled to end on 20 August. The U.S. Government is 
financing Fuertes Caminos at a cost of $1.5 million. 
  It was reported in San Salvador that 1,147 tons of equipment 
and provisions to furnish the joint operation have been unloaded 
in the port of Acajutla, east of San Salvador. Corado pointed 
out that some of the equipment brought by the U.S. soldiers will 
be donated to the Salvadoran Armed Forces.

  [Text] Yesterday, Defense Minister Humberto Corado Figueroa 
said he was satisfied with the new Armed Forces Organization Law 
approved by the Legislative Assembly. 
  General Corado said, "it was essentially necessary to 
promulgate the new Armed Forces Organization Law" considering 
the changes in the nation's Constitution. The military leader 
explained that the military corps' former Organization Law did 
not agree with the changes and reforms being made to the 
Constitution, "so a new law is important and necessary." 
  According to the defense minister, the new Armed Forces 
Organization Law "authenticates, modernizes, and adapts" the 
military corps to the country's new modern times of peace and 
democracy. The former Organization Law went into effect in 
1961, but because of the country's social changes, new 
legislation was necessary to guide the military's future. 
  Concerning the Compulsory Military Service Law, approved by 
the Legislative Assembly and currently in effect, the defense 
minister said the military is still working on ways to make it 
effective. Corado Figueroa said that for this law to be 
effective, it will be necessary to set up an information system 
which permits access to information which determines which 
citizens are fit for military service. The ages established by 
the Compulsory Military Service Law range from 18 to 30 years. 
  The military leader also said that, for the law to be 
effective, it requires an infrastructure at a nationwide level, 
including recruitment centers to gather the necessary 
information on those citizens who will participate in a draft. 
Corado added that this draft will have exemptions as foreseen 
by the law, although he did not say who would be exempt, as well 
as different forms of military service -- some forms being 
permanent and full-time service with others being part-time and 
on weekends. The first compulsory military service draft has 
been scheduled to take place on 1 December 1994.

  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani has announced that a 
heightened struggle will be waged against crime throughout the 
country in response to attacks on National Civilian Police [PNC] 
members. According to Cristiani, the attacks are in response to 
the PNC's ongoing battle against organized crime. 
  The president said: With these attacks "criminals are trying 
to intimidate agents so they abandon the fight," but he warned 
that both the PNC and the government will continue the war 
against organized crime with greater vigor. Cristiani made this 
announcement at noon yesterday, just after he presided over a 
ceremony to commemorate the Santa Ana centennial, which was 
officially named a "Heroic City." 
  The government has said authorities "have taken steps to 
fight the gangs of kidnappers" who have spread terror throughout 
the Santa Ana region. As was previously reported, gangs of men 
dressed in olive green and armed with heavy weapons have set up 
various camps at the base of the Santa Ana volcano and continue 
to kidnap and extort money from farmers. A self-proclaimed 
"Commander Oscar" even sent threatening letters announcing the 
beginning of a new war in this area. According to Cristiani, 
the PNC has taken note of the complaints and begun 
investigations, and he added that the Army has begun patrolling 
the area. 
  Meanwhile, Cristiani also denied external pressure was 
exerted to reform the Constitution, as some jurists have 
claimed. According to the president, the reforms being made by 
the assembly are designed to modernize the state and modify the 
government's administration, specifically within the Supreme 
Court of Justice and the Arbitration Court. 
  On the other hand, Dr. Kirio Waldo Salgado, who was 
consulted 
yesterday in Santa Ana, believes "the Legislative Assembly is 
once again making the mistake it made in 1991." Our Constitution 
is being hastily reformed because of foreign pressure, while 
national interests are being neglected. Salgado charged that 
many decisions which hurt the people "are being adopted in a 
foreign embassy, which is bad." 
  On another subject, President Cristiani said he will meet 
with his Central American counterparts in San Jose, Costa Rica, 
on 8 May at President Jose Figueres' inauguration. There they 
will decide when they will hold the next summit, which Dr. 
Armando Calderon Sol will probably attend as president of El 
Salvador.

  [Text] Last night, the Legislative Assembly approved a 
series of constitutional reforms affecting individual rights, 
public health, economic order, and the judicial branch. 
  The reform of Subparagraph 2 of Article 11 establishes that 
a 
person has the right to a writ of habeas corpus when any 
individual or authority illegally or arbitrarily restricts his 
or her liberty. This is also applicable when any authority 
attacks the mental or physical wellbeing of those people 
detained. 
  Modifications to Article 17 state that no government branch, 
official, or authority may use expired procedures in pending 
legal cases or to start legal proceedings against individuals. 
  Regarding health, an amendment to Article 68 establishes 
that 
the Public Health Higher Council shall comprise representatives 
from the fields of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, veterinary 
medicine, clinical laboratory science, nursing, and psychiatry. 
Congress also reformed Article 120, which now reads: "All 
concessions granted by the state to exploit harbors, railroads, 
canals, or other public holdings require that terms and 
conditions be set while taking into account the nature of the 
projects and the investment required." 
  Regarding distribution of the state budget, the judicial 
branch will be entitled to an annual allotment of not less than 
4 percent of the overall budget. This includes the National 
Judiciary Council and the National Lawyers and Notary Public 
Council. The Prosecutor General's Office, the Attorney 
General's Office, and the Human Rights Ombudsman will together 
have an annual assignment of not less than 2 percent of the 
budget.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Magana from "The Newscast" newscast] </F>
  [Text] This Friday, Kirio Waldo Salgado, president of the 
Liberty and Democracy Institute, announced his opposition to the 
package of constitutional reforms that the Legislative Assembly 
is expected to pass within the next few hours. Salgado contends 
the amendments are being promoted as a result of pressure from 
abroad. 
  Salgado, a political analyst, announced his support for the 
president of the Supreme Court of Justice, who has already 
voiced his opposition to the constitutional reforms about to be 
passed by the Legislative Assembly. The reforms call for 
partial changes to the functions and characteristics of 
governmental bodies such as the Supreme Court of Justice. 
  [Begin Salgado recording] The Legislative Assembly is about 
to make the same mistake it made in 1991. Hastily, and because 
of international pressure, it plans to reform laws -- our 
Constitution -- while disregarding Salvadoran interests. It 
will yield to foreign pressure and play the game of the 
hegemonic power that governs us. [end recording] 
  Salgado argues that the deputies are making mistakes by 
heeding guidelines from the United Nations, hastily approving 
reforms, and ignoring the true needs of the people. 
  [Begin Salgado recording] I think it is the Salvadorans who 
must make our decisions, whether good or bad. The problem in El 
Salvador is that we have to live with decisions adopted not by 
the Salvadoran people but by a foreign embassy. [end recording] 
  Salgado has been a bitter critic of the U.S.-promoted 
constitutional reforms that will completely change El Salvador's 
justice system.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 5 May. 
  Jose Roberto Orellana Milla, president of the Salvadoran 
Central Reserve Bank, has described as positive the results of 
the privatization program of the country's banks and financial 
institutions. Regarding the sale of shares of the Atlacatl 
financial institution, he has said 25 percent of the shares were 
made available to small investors, 25 percent to Atlacatl 
employees, and the remaining 50 percent to investors who would 
like to obtain more than 100,000 colons. Orellana has announced 
that thus far five banks and four financial institutions have 
been privatized. (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 
GMT 26 Apr 94) 
  Central Reserve Bank stabilization certificates totaling 
93,715,226.72 colons were negotiated during the early morning 
stock market sessions. Stabilization bonds of the Bank of 
Guatemala and Emergency Coffee fund were also negotiated. 
Yesterday's total negotiations amounting to 109,613,305 colones 
showed an upward trend, compared with last month's operations, 
which did not go over the 8-million colons mark. (San Salvador 
LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 26 Apr p 14) 
  The Salvadoran Central Reserve Bank has confirmed that in 
1993 imports totaled $1.9 billion, an 11.9-percent increase over 
1992. Bank sources have said the increase was a result of the 
stabilized rate of exchange, the commercial opening, and 
facilities offered to industries. Exports showed a 21-percent 
increase compared to 1992. (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in 
Spanish 1800 GMT 28 April 94)

  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 3 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, 
Foreign Relations Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman said the 
Guatemalan Government is interested in resuming the stalled 
negotiations on the more than 150-year-old territorial dispute 
between Belize and Guatemala. 
  The negotiations were interrupted in the aftermath of the 
failed 26 May 1993 coup d'etat by former President Jorge 
Serrano, who recognized the Belizean state, a British colony 
until 1981, for the first time in Guatemalan history and 
established diplomatic relations. President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio upheld the Serrano's decision (1991-93), although many 
political sectors and citizens have demanded he change his 
position. 
  Today, Minister Vielman told foreign correspondents the 
following: "As the executive branch, we have no jurisdiction" in 
recognizing Belize as an independent state. She failed to say, 
however, whose jurisdiction such a decision would fall under. 
  She pointed out that the "Belize Council," a new council 
comprising lawyers and other experts on the subject, must deal 
with this issue. The council, which will serve an advisory 
role, will revise the previous legislation and will recommend to 
the government what to do next. The Belize Council, whose 
appointment will be announced next week, will make 
recommendations that will be reviewed by the executive branch 
"in accordance with foreign policies before acting upon them." 
  The foreign minister insisted this is a legal conflict, but 
said she trusts the territorial dispute will have a negotiated 
solution and avoid arbitration within the international courts.

  [Text] The body of a woman who appeared to be a foreigner 
and was accused of stealing children was found yesterday along 
the banks of the Cabus River in Malacatan Municipality, San 
Marcos Department. The body showed signs of bruises and machete 
wounds. The body of the woman, who was described as being about 
40 years old and 1.7 meters tall, was found by passersby who 
immediately notified police. 
  The regional judge and National Police arrived at the scene 
and determined that the woman had been murdered several days 
earlier. Because the body was already decomposing, they ordered 
an immediate burial. Her identity remains unknown. 
  Police report that an investigation has begun and that four 
individuals have confessed to killing the woman, who apparently 
was a foreigner. Those arrested were identified as Hector Perez 
Vicente, 21; Valentin Santos, 27; Jesus Martin, 20; and Roberto 
Perez. They confessed to committing the crime because the woman 
was allegedly involved in the theft of children at El Silencio 
ranch, San Marcos Department.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 3 
May. 
  Despite the purchase of electricity from Panama, electricity 
rationing in Tegucigalpa will be increased by 30 minutes this 
week. This is evident by the periodic outage report the National 
Enterprise for Electric Power, ENEE, has published. The report 
indicates the outages will be for periods of five hours. The 
ENEE has also announced outages on Sundays for San Pedro Sula, 
Villanueva, La Ceiba, Choluteca, and San Lorenzo, areas that 
previously had been unaffected. (Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO DE 
HONDURAS in Spanish 25 April 94 p 4) 
  Yesterday, the finance and public credit minister and the 
president of the Central Bank of Honduras announced a 10-percent 
tax on certain luxury items in order to combat a fiscal deficit 
that is approximately 12 percent. No date has been set yet for 
application of this tax. (San Pedro Sula TIEMPO in Spanish 26 
April 94 p 3)

  [Text] Managua, May 3 (CNA) -- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister 
Ernesto Leal Sanchez Tuesday [3 May] reiterated his country's 
firm support for the Republic of China's [ROC] bid to return to 
the United Nations [UN] . 
  Speaking at a news conference for the ROC press corps in 
advance of President Li Teng-hui's visit, Leal said that the 
international community can not deny the economic strength of 
the ROC and its huge foreign currency reserves. 
  He stressed that the road back to the UN will be difficult 
and fraught with obstacles, but the UN cannot continue to ignore 
the rights of the more than 21 million Chinese people living in 
Taiwan. 
  Leal also said that Nicaragua will strengthen its relations 
with other Asia-Pacific nations, and use the ROC to help in its 
efforts. The ROC left the UN in 1971 after Beijing assumed the 
China seat.

<F P=106> [Statement by presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo of </F>
the Solidarity Party during the final presidential "debate" 
sponsored by the Latin American Institute of Advanced Study and 
the Media Presidential Debate Committee; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Compatriots: In barely six days, the electoral 
process, which will decide on Panama's course for the next five 
years, will have concluded. During these past months, you the 
voters have been subjected to an ardent publicity campaign. All 
the media have broadly reported the struggle we have been 
engaged in to lead the government. 
  All of you have massively participated in the electoral 
debates. The rebirth of Panamanian democracy explains the 
media's all-out participation in the electoral process. It is 
regrettable, however, that some media, by offering biased 
information, have not maintained the objectivity they had 
promised to the community or their own code of ethics. They did 
not rise to the occasion in these historic moments. 
  Nevertheless, we, the seven candidates, progressed in our 
campaigns in a climate of broad liberties. We have undoubtedly 
been able to identify the problems the country is currently 
experiencing and the immense responsibility we will have to face 
in the near future. Unemployment, lack of health services, 
education, housing, public security, corruption, the lack of 
true and speedy justice, and environmental contamination are 
problems that have been clearly identified. 
  All the candidates have drawn up specific government plans, 
nevertheless, only one of us will be elected on 8 May to direct 
this nation's destiny. On 8 May, each and every one of us will 
be alone, one moment completely alone with our conscious 
deciding our future, that of our children, and our 
grandchildren. At that time, all the publicity campaigns, all 
the polls, and all the promises will be left behind. We will 
have before us a voting ballot. This nation's presidency will 
depend on the selection each of us makes. 
  I want to reiterate the overwhelming need for what from the 
beginning has been our slogan and the name of our alliance: 
Without a true union of everyone, it will be impossible to solve 
the serious problems we are facing. Without a true national 
consensus, it will not be possible to successfully face the 
future challenges. We strongly believe much more unites us than 
divides us. 
  There is a broad community of interests and goals that unite 
all Panamanians, however, these are not clearly manifested due 
to the pettiness of a few, by created interests, sterile 
disputes, the leaders' intolerance, the insolence and arrogance 
of the powerful. To overcome this situation, we propose to fully 
democratize the state and society. We are going to give the 
poor and anonymous Panamanians who struggle from day to day a 
place in society and new self-esteem. We are going to give the 
community the participation they deserve in the making of 
decisions. We are going to establish an impartial, independent 
justice that will guarantee a democratic social order. 
  In addition to struggling for consensus, we have developed 
in 
the political arena a new style, a style of decency, honesty, 
respect, and tolerance. We are not interested in arbitrary or 
demagogic positions. We reject dirty campaigns and personal 
attacks that weaken those who launch them more than their 
target. Our opposition is directed at the difficulties all 
Panamanians are experiencing that prevent our personal and 
collective achievement. We are not interested in highlighting 
the Panamanians' negative aspects, rather we are interested in 
highlighting the positive to construct a future. 
  To my colleagues in this struggle, Mireya de Gruber, Ruben 
Dario Carles, Ernesto Perez Balladares, Jose Salvador Munoz, 
Ruben Blades, and Eduardo Vallarino, my sincere congratulations. 
I am convinced that all of you -- despite the difference that 
separate us -- have known how to struggle to save Panamanian 
democracy. I invite you, once the election is over, to 
acknowledge with chivalry and generosity the victory of whomever 
is favored by the majority of the votes. I also invite -- 
following our example -- whoever wins to call for a true 
national consensus. Currently, this appears to be a desire that 
can be fulfilled as our initial proposal of national unity has 
been adopted as their own by each of the candidates. To have 
achieved this, fills us with patriotic pride. 
  Panamanians, I ask you for calm reflection before casting 
your vote. Think of who among the seven is better prepared to 
give you and your children an honest future with social peace 
and with hopes that can be achieved. Give me this opportunity 
to serve you. Thank you very much, good evening, and may God 
illuminate us all on 8 May.

<F P=106> [Statement by presidential candidate Jose Salvador Munoz of </F>
the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party during the final presidential 
"debate" sponsored by the Latin American Institute of Advanced 
Study and the Media Presidential Debate Committee; place and 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow citizens: To every thing there is a season 
and a time to every purpose under the heaven, Ecclesiastes 3:1. 
During the past three months, we have, in one way or another, 
witnessed or participated in the campaign to elect the new 
president of the Republic of Panama. During this time, we have 
seen and listened to, by virtue of multimillionaire political 
campaigns on television and other kinds, prepared statements, 
rehearsed poses and smiles, exaggerated promises, impossible 
assurances, election-time music, and the squandering of money to 
try to convince voters to favor one of the candidates. 
  This stage, however, has now passed. The time to vote has 
come. In my long years as a lawyer, I have found that there is a 
factor that is absolutely necessary to have a good, working 
lawyer-client relation. That factor can be summed up in just 
one word: trust. To have trust, we have to know the 
professional. We must know his expertise, character, knowledge, 
experience, and courage and we must be convinced that he is not 
going to betray our interests. To govern a country, we need to 
know the same things, not only of the presidential candidate but 
also of those who accompany him on his ticket. 
  Julia Suira is the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party's second 
vice 
presidential candidate. Julia Suira is an exceptional woman. 
She has dedicated 30 years of her life to the labor movement as 
a union leader in the clothing industry. She knows the intimate 
details of the Panamanian workers' toil, pain, sufferings, 
anguishes, and problems. With her, the Panamanian working class 
knows its interests will be protected, not betrayed, and that 
exploitation and abuses will not be allowed. 
  Dr. Rodrigo Bernal is our candidate for the first vice 
presidency. He is a medical doctor with 40 years of experience 
in his field. His colleagues acknowledge that he is a pioneer 
in his specialty and he has had a spectacular professional life. 
His experience qualifies him to help us solve the health 
problems we will confront beginning 1 September. Dr. Bernal is 
a trusted man. 
  I am a man who has practiced law for 34 years. My clients 
trust me. They trust me as all the people who have known me 
since I was a child do. My campaign manager and I have been 
friends for 43 years and I have never broken this trust. My 
first vice president and his brothers and I have been friends 
over 40 years and the trust has never been broken. All the 
people who approach me know my friends and clients trust me and 
that they will encounter generosity, affection, decency, and 
everything a man who can be trusted can offer. No one can say 
any of us has betrayed anyone. We give trust. 
  In past statements, I announced I would shakeup [revolcon] 
everything that was wrong in this country. There were people 
who laughed at this expression and others said it was an 
unpolished one. Although I have explained this before, I want to 
say that shakeup is a true Spanish word. According to the 
Academy of the Spanish Language, in its first use it means to 
roll over [darle la vuelta a uno] and in its second use to 
defeat the enemy [vencer al adversario]. And this is what its 
all about. We mean to shakeup and defeat everything that is 
wrong in our country. 
  The hour has come to shakeup our educational system because 
we have to improve our students' intellectual level and prepare 
them for the forthcoming century. The hour has come to shakeup 
public administration because it is necessary that we end 
corruption to make this a decent country so it can develop and 
be respected. The hour has come to shakeup the administration 
of justice because our judicial system has to be efficient, 
just, and expeditious. This will allow all our citizens to have 
confidence that the cases presented to the judicial branch are 
treated in accordance with the law. The hour has come to 
shakeup and defeat unemployment because we have to end poverty 
and underemployment in Panama. The hour has come to shakeup the 
health system because all Panamanians have the right to receive 
expeditious health services, not just when death is knocking at 
the door. The hour has come to shakeup everything that runs 
improperly in this country, in our Panama: garbage collection, 
street repairs, traffic chaos, prostitution, crime, drug 
trafficking, biased bidding processes, influence peddling, 
nepotism, lack of courtesy, lack of water, the high cost of 
electricity, in sum, all the things that need to be corrected to 
improve the catastrophic situation in which we find ourselves. 
The time for frivolities is over. There are six days to go 
before 8 May. We invite the Panamanians to start this shakeup 
on 8 May. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Statement by presidential candidate Eduardo Vallarino of </F>
the Christian Democratic Party, PDC, during the final 
presidential "debate" sponsored by the Latin American Institute 
of Advanced Study and the Media Presidential Debate Committee; 
place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow countrymen: Our country is facing one of the 
most critical moments of its history. Within the next five 
years, we must prepare ourselves to manage the Canal. We have 
already lost more than 15 years. We must also make good use of 
the reverted areas and goods so that these will generate 
opportunities for the country and its people. These areas and 
goods must not be used to enrich a few or to become a burden on 
the government. They must not become a source of shame for the 
Panamanians, as happened with the railroad and other 
installations. Likewise, we must consolidate our democratic 
institutions so Panamanians can live in an atmosphere of 
justice, have better opportunities for development, and enjoy 
true social peace. 
  In the international field, we must decide on our future in 
the face of the large economic blocs of countries that are 
becoming organized worldwide. The most important aspect is we 
must launch a true war against poverty and malnutrition, against 
the lack of health and education, as well as against the lack of 
hope, opportunities, and future for the most important thing 
Panama has: our children and youth. 
  This electoral process offers us a beautiful opportunity to 
solve these problems if we know how to act wisely. Fortunately, 
the campaign has been managed well. Fortunately, the campaign 
has been managed well, and it offers us an opportunity to show 
the world Panama's good face. Lately, Panama has been in the 
news only with reports on narcotics trafficking, money 
laundering, and gun running. This has done us great harm, and it 
affects the most humble Panamanians because it makes investments 
difficult. Therefore, this affects the creation of new sources 
of employment, which is what the people need. 
  So far, this has been a clean and peaceful electoral process 
that will give us the opportunity to show our good face and even 
serve as a good example for the entire world. It will be an 
opportunity to begin cleaning up once again the image of Panama 
and of the Panamanians, and to say that we are also serious 
people. 
  The only thing that has marred the electoral process has 
been 
too many polls that have apparently been made not to inform the 
people, but rather to misinform and to create an alleged 
polarization between certain candidates. It is a good idea that 
the Electoral Tribunal has just issued a decree regulating polls 
and even banning them as of tomorrow [as heard]. The good thing 
is that on 8 May, all polls will be at zero, and the only thing 
that will count will be the true will of the Panamanian people. 
That will be the only important and decisive poll. 
  Therefore, when you enter the voting booth, remember that 
you, and only you as the voter, are responsible for choosing the 
next president. At that moment, as a responsible citizen, you 
must forget all publicity and polls and vote according to your 
conscience for whomever you think is the candidate best prepared 
to serve the country. At that moment, you have our future and 
that of our children in your hands. You will be responsible for 
the kind of ruler Panama will have. It is my duty at this time 
to tell you what our candidacy has to offer you. 
  In the first place, I have the best academic and 
professional 
training of all the candidates. In addition, I am the only one 
who has true experience in the field of international relations, 
which are so important for Panama in the next five years. In 
the second place, I have devoted my professional life to 
activities that are directly related to the creation of sources 
of employment. This experience is important in view of the 
large unemployment there is in the country. I know how to 
create jobs, and that is what Panama needs now. No other 
candidate has any similar experience. 
  In the third place, I offer the testimony of a life of over 
35 years at the service of Panamanians by creating civic 
organizations and professional associations for solving 
education problems, preventing improper use of drugs, and coping 
with unemployment. I did not wait to become a candidate before 
I started working for my country. I have served my country with 
my work, at the service of the people, which is the most 
important thing our country has. That is my testimony, not just 
of now, but something I have done all my life. I want to do 
1,000 times more from within the government of this work that I 
have been doing as an ordinary citizen. 
  I also have a pact with the people which contains the 
answers to our country's main problems. I consider this a firm 
and serious commitment I have signed before a notary public. 
This commitment stems from my most intimate convictions. I 
highly regard my own signature a promise and much more. I am 
the only candidate who has had the courage and honesty to sign 
such a document. I have no personal commitments with anyone in 
particular, but rather with the people. There is no economic 
power supporting me, like those which have been supporting the 
governments for many decades. I am moved only by the sincere 
wish to serve my fatherland. 
  The presidency of the Republic is neither a carnival nor a 
picnic. It is something extremely serious. In such critical 
moments for our future and that of our country, you must decide 
who you want as president of the Republic. As a fellow 
countryman, I ask you to think during the next five days with 
your conscience about the seriousness of the commitment you have 
on 8 May and to decide wisely. I ask that you, with your vote, 
you give me the opportunity to do within government what I have 
been doing in private throughout my life: to work for Panama 
and for Panamanians. Thank you very much.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 5 May. 
  Paris AFP in Spanish at 1739 GMT on 26 May reports that 
during the first four months of 1994, the Panamanian Government 
netted $330 million in tax revenue, exceeding estimates by $9 
million, according to official sources. Alvaro Aleman, director 
of the revenue office, told newsmen that in the past few years 
state revenue figures have remained stable and no difficulties 
are foreseen in the immediate future. 
  Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish on 27 April 
reports Olga de Guizado, executive director of the National 
Banking Commission, has announced that the Panamanian banking 
center has 16 new banks with 26.078 billion balboas in assets. 
She said that although some banks had left the country, there 
are now 110 banks conducting financial activities, just as in 
1990. Compared with 1992, she noted that the banking 
institutions registered an increase of 3.044 billion balboas -- 
13.2 percent -- specifically stemming from internal and external 
deposits. Credits to the private sector also increased 24 
percent, as a result of credit activities in the commercial

<F P=106> [Relay from Potosi] </F>
  [Excerpts] Hilario Mamani was killed in a clash between 
peasants and military personnel dressed in civilian clothes. 
Moreover, three huts were burned. Commenting on this incident, 
Hector Hinojosa, member of the Potosi department Bolivian Labor 
Federation [COB] branch, said the following to this radio 
station: 
  [Begin Hinojosa recording, in progress] ....this time 
around, 
there were 20 passengers and (?combatants). It has been 
established that police and military personnel were planted 
among bus passengers. They used guns and tear gas against our 
fellow peasants in the towns of (?Quintapujio) and Lenas. [end 
recording] 
  Moreover, the (?Quintapujio) COB branch leader reported that 
they fear for the life of Domingo Vargas who was arrested by 
military personnel dressed in civilian clothes. He also 
reported that the following are reported missing: Francisco 
Cruz, Pedro Nina, Martin Machi, Apolinar Chanini, the brothers 
Zacarias and Celso Huanucu, and Bernabe Miranda. [passage 
omitted] 
  Speaking to this radio station, local Prefect Efrain Medron 
denied everything, adding that no one was killed. He said: 
  [Begin Medron recording] With great respect to all citizens, 
I want to assert that this report is absolutely false. This is 
a slanderous and cowardly statement. 
  This morning I met with the department police commander, 
(?who denied there were any arrests). He said there are no 
reports about this incident. [end recording] 
  During a telephone conversation with this reporter, the 
prefect invited the press, COB leaders, and the National 
Confederation of Bolivian Peasant Workers [CNTB], to head a 
committee -- which will also include a forensic doctor and human 
rights organization representatives -- to conduct the pertinent 
investigations and an autopsy. This investigating committee is 
reportedly leaving for the site this morning at 0900. 
  A COB plenum meeting has condemned the peasant massacre. 
Speaking after the COB department branch meeting yesterday 
afternoon, COB Branch Leader Jorge Solares said: 
  [Begin Solares recording, in progress] ....intensify the 
fast 
in all sectors. 
  2. To continue the indefinite general strike and street 
demonstrations. 
  3. To condemn the COB executive board for having called a 
recess precisely at the time when workers were rebelling in 
demand for the their rights. 
  4. To repudiate the repression to which workers and 
peasants are being subjected. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "Protected </F>
Markets"] 
  [Text] President Bill Clinton has one month, until 3 June, 
to decide whether to renew or remove most favored nation status 
for the PRC. He was counseled by the entire spectrum of the 
American foreign policy establishment not to spoil relations 
with Beijing. Not even for this reason did Clinton quit treating 
the PRC as a third-class world power, and submitted its leaders 
(in Beijing) to the humiliation of telling them how to treat 
common and political prisoners, workers, and travelers. In name 
of human rights, Clinton created an impasse. The Chinese cannot 
lose face, and the United States is ready to spoil 20 years of 
rapprochement with Beijing. Besides this, Clinton is not 
contributing to the human rights cause, as if he demands respect 
for the dignity of man he will not receive an answer, and if he 
lets the case pass without further development he will be 
consecrated not to be a champion of decency, but rather a weak 
and timid leader. 
  One of the great problems for the Clinton administration is 
that it has launched itself into a crusade to increase the 
economy and guarantee U.S. jobs without minding the rest of the 
world, on whom the trade guaranteeing American jobs depends. To 
this we must add that Clinton was elected by a party that is 
nothing more than a conglomerate of permanently conflicting 
trends. A Democratic president must implement policies of human 
rights, full employment, free trade, universal democracy, 
government incentives for the industry, etc., and still lead 
world affairs -- and all this within a highly ethical framework. 
Few presidents have managed to escape this complex position, 
and Clinton is no exception. Right now, in Washington and in 
other capitals, those harmed and the enemies shout: Hypocrisy! 
Allies and friends shout: Weakness! 
  It is difficult to reconcile what the Clinton administration 
says with what it does. Washington is engaged in a real trade 
war with Japan, which is, in fact, a closed market. One of the 
battle fronts is the semiconductor market. U.S. chip producers 
hold 43 percent of the world chip market and 20 percent of the 
Japanese market, while the Japanese hold 42 percent of the world 
market and 20 percent of the American market. Which market is 
closed to whom? 
  The U.S. Government has now decided to subsidize the flat 
computer screen industry with $1 billion. The pretext is that 
portable computers are essential for the U.S. Armed Forces, and 
the Japanese producers, who control this market, are reluctant 
to sell to the U.S. Defense Department. Thus an entire U.S. 
industrial sector will receive subsidies. These are not 
subsidies masked as military research and technological 
development, which afterwards return as products with civilian 
applications, as the U.S. Government has always done it -- but 
are direct subsidies for the installation of industrial plants 
and a marketing system. It is not the first time the 
electronics industry has received government aid. In 1987 the 
government carried out the multi-billion Sematech program for 
the development and consolidation of the chip industry. In those 
days the U.S. strategic defense really depended on imported 
chips, and the justification for government intervention in the 
economic domain could be swallowed. Now, however, the objective 
is simply trade: to increase the 3 percent U.S.-controlled 
market share of flat computer screens. 
  The Argentines are now feeling the sour aftertaste of 
retribution for having aligned themselves politically with the 
United States. Once described by the U.S. Government as a model 
example of trade deregulation, Argentina will now be included on 
the black list of the disgraceful Super 301, because it did not 
manage to approve an intellectual property rights law satisfying 
the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. It must be pointed out that 
the Argentine pharmaceutical industry is not big enough to 
affect the international business of U.S. laboratories. The 
U.S. policy now is to conquer every single inch of market, every 
available cent, always flying the most noble banners. Ecology, 
for example, has justified pressures on Brazilian shrimp 
fishermen to use contraptions costing from $100 to $500 each, 
which allow turtles to escape from the fishing nets. Is this 
concern for Brazilian turtles? Perhaps. The fact is that the 
United States is burdening Brazilian fishermen in the same 
manner it burdened them at the end of the eighties, through 
justified domestic pressure. Hypocrisy or weakness? Whatever 
it is, it could cost Brazil dearly.

  [Text] The Brazilian Government has decided to impose a 
27.19 percent "antidumping" surcharge on Brazilian imports of 
low-carbon ferrochromium alloy from Russia, Kazakhstan, and 
Ukraine, in accordance with Decree No. 233 dated 27 April and 
published in the DIARIO OFICIAL DA UNIAO on 28 April. The 
decision came in response to a complaint lodged by the 
Ferro-Ligas da Bahia Company (Ferbasa) with the Foreign Trade 
Secretariat in November 1992, on the grounds that these imports 
were hurting Brazilian production. 
  Ferbasa is the only Brazilian manufacturer of low-carbon 
ferrochromium alloy, and its factory in Pojuca, Bahia State, can 
produce 11,000 metric tons annually. Rising imports have since 
1990 been causing Ferbasa to sharply reduce its production, to 
the point of shutting down one of its furnaces. 
  Based on a preliminary investigation into "dumping," the 
Brazilian Government decided to impose in September 1993 a 
provisional surcharge of 18.97 percent. In accordance with the 
Finance Ministry decree, the prices of imported alloy from the 
above coutries are now 27.19 percent lower than prevailing 
market prices. The surcharge will be in force for five years.

  [Text] The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], the PFL 
[Liberal Front Party], and the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] have 
reached an agreement in Brasilia, formalizing an alliance to 
support the presidential candidacy of Senator Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso. The parties have yet to designate Cardoso's running 
mate, on the grounds that the alliance does not focus on 
specific names but on a program of government. 
  The presidents of the three parties reiterated that the 
alliance focuses on a program of government, not on names, 
adding that the starting point is the program of the PSDB. The 
PFL, however, made suggestions that will be included in the 
government proposal. 
  PSDB President Tasso Jereissati said the three parties have 
formed an alliance to provide conditions for governing the 
country. 
  Senator Cardoso said the alliance does not just seek to win 
elections but to implement a joint government, adding that he 
expects other parties to join the alliance. He said: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] I have talked a lot with [Social 
Workers Party President] Alvaro Dias and we might reach 
agreement, if not at a national level at least in several states 
-- like in Brasilia, where talks are on an advanced stage. I 
believe we will be able to do the same thing in other regions 
too. Alvaro Dias will run for the post of governor in Parana. 
I told him that my party has joined other parties that have 
their own candidates, thus I can continue to communicate and 
personally support him. [end recording] 
  After formalizing the alliance, the presidents of the PTB, 
PSDB, and PFL met at Senator Jose Eduardo Vieira's office to 
discuss the campaign strategy.

  [Text] Marcelo Pimentel, former Superior Labor Court, TST, 
president, is the new labor minister. This afternoon President 
Itamar Franco invited Marcelo Pimentel to head the Labor 
Ministry. Pimentel immediately accepted the position. 
  Marcelo Pimentel stood out in the TST for his frank dialogue 
with workers when decisions had to be made about collective 
bargaining accords, and as TST president. 
  Pimentel possesses all qualities President Franco wants in a 
labor minister. Franco wanted the labor minister to be well 
accepted by all labor unions. He will replace Mozart de Abreu 
Lima, who has been acting labor minister since Walter Barelli 
resigned to run in this year's general elections. 
  The date for Pimentel's installation as the new labor 
minister has yet to be set.

  [Text] Santiago, 3 May (EFE) -- Planning and Coordination 
Minister Luis Maira announced today that the Chilean Government 
will establish a cooperation program with Cuba and other 
Caribbean countries. 
  Participating in a seminar on strategic planning in 
international cooperation, Maira labeled such a program an 
"urgent need" despite the fact that from the political viewpoint 
the Chilean Government does not have among its short-term 
priorities the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with the 
Fidel Castro regime. 
  Bilateral links were broken in 1973 after the military coup 
headed by General Augusto Pinochet, who overthrew the socialist 
government of Salvador Allende. 
  Relations were resumed at the consular level in 1990, after 
the installation of the Patricio Aylwin administration. 
  Maira said that Chile, after surpassing the $3,000 per 
capita 
income level, has been excluded from the industrialized 
countries' financial cooperation aid list, and has entered a 
stage of transition from receptor to provider of this type of 
aid. 
  He said that within this context, Chile is beginning to be 
seen, especially in Central America and the Caribbean, as "a 
rich country." This has created a growing demand from that 
region for cooperation aid, which should somehow be arranged 
"despite the budget limits and restrictions" affecting the 
country. 
  "It is difficult to avoid these demands," said Maira, who 
added that the demands come mainly from Cuban and the Dominican 
Republic. 
  Maira said that in the case of Cuba it is necessary to have 
a 
growing degree of cooperation "on the basis of the progress and 
internal situation of Cuba and the presence on the island of 
several private Chilean companies." 
  Maira added that Chile is one of the Latin American 
countries 
with the largest investment programs abroad, especially in the 
region, and this should be taken into consideration in the 
government's action.

  [Text] Santiago, 2 May (EFE) -- Foreign Minister Carlos 
Figueroa said today that he does not reject the possibility of 
signing an economic agreement with the Republic of Croatia on 
improved conditions for investment, investments in social 
security, and the privatization process. 
  Figueroa made this statement after signing an agreement 
between the Chilean and Croatian Governments extending visa 
requirements for carriers of diplomatic, official, and special 
passports. 
  The agreement was signed by Foreign Minister Figueroa and 
visiting Croatian Vice President Mate Granic within the 
framework of the latter's three-day official visit. Granic 
arrived in Santiago on 1 May from Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
  Foreign Minister Figueroa explained that Chile will receive 
from Croatia training in the educational and technical 
professional fields. 
  He added that there are discussions under way on the 
possibility of establishing "joint ventures" with Chilean 
companies in the area of shipyards. 
  Furthermore, Foreign Minister Figueroa expressed his 
satisfaction that Croatia has achieved peace, which has enabled 
it to achieve political and economic stability. 
  He explained that the remaining conflict in the area 
occupied 
by the Serbs will be resolved through negotiations. 
  In addition, Croatian Vice President Mate Granic, who is 
also 
foreign minister, thanked the Chilean people for having been the 
first Latin American country to have recognized Croatia's 
independence, which was declared on 16 January 1992. 
  He added that 25 percent of Croatian territory is still 
under 
the domain of the local Serbs, who are supported and encouraged 
by the regime in Belgrade, an area protected by the United 
Nations. Nevertheless, Croatia has been able to achieve its 
political stability. 
  Granic said that his country seeks two basic objectives: 
first, to achieve the peaceful reintegration of the occupied 
territories and integrate them into the legal political system 
that is enforced today in Croatia; and second, to achieve an 
economic development integrated with the country's political 
system.

  [Text] Santiago, 1 May (EFE) -- United Labor Confederation 
(CUT) Chairman Manuel Bustos today asked the government to grant 
the labor movement a real chance of participating in the 
decisionmaking process of those measures that affect workers. 
  Addressing a CUT rally held to commemorate International 
Labor Day that was unable to attract a large audience -- it was 
attended by no more than 4,000 people -- Bustos said: "It is 
not enough for us to be questioned and to be heard if our 
opinions are not taken into account." 
  The majority of those who attended the rally are members of 
the unions dominated by the Communist Party [PCCh] who arrived 
at the rally held on Avenue General Velasquez, located in the 
western section of Santiago, after attending an unauthorized 
march in an area of Santiago. 
  The PCCh, which Bustos has charged is trying to divide the 
CUT, built its own podium, from which its leaders criticized the 
CUT leadership headed by Bustos. The PCCh leaders also charged 
Bustos with being a government tool and with disavowing the 
claims of Chilean workers. 
  This situation caused some minor incidents, unlike what 
occurred one week ago when a CUT congress ended with fist fights 
among representatives of different CUT factions. 
  In his speech, Manuel Bustos harshly criticized Education 
Minister Ernesto Schiefelbein, whom he charged with being 
responsible for a labor conflict with teachers, as a result of 
which 120,000 teachers will hold a national strike on 18 May to 
demand legal reforms and better salaries. 
  Labor Minister Jorge Arrate, who is a Socialist, addressed 
the rally on behalf of the government. He said that the 
government will not practice demagoguery or create "the 
illusion" of approving salaries higher than those allowed by the 
country's economic situation.

<F P=106> [Special report by Tomas Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] The 30 April deadline which the United States had 
suggested for Argentina to promulgate the law on pharmaceutical 
patents is now past, and the five committees that are studying 
the bill are nowhere near issuing a ruling. Argentina has thus 
been "included" on the list of nations that will be subject to 
economic punishment. 
  The five Senate committees have already held at least 18 
consultative sessions, which they resumed in April. Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella is expected to appear before the 
committees during the second half of May. The first phase will 
end a few days later, when Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo 
appears before the committees. 
  After that, the committees will be in a position to issue a 
favorable ruling despite the opposition of the Radical Civic 
Union (UCR) bloc led by Jose Genoud, one of the underwriters of 
an alternative bill which "is better suited to Argentine 
interests," as Genoud has repeatedly said. 
  Of the five committees that are looking at the executive 
branch's bill on patents, three are chaired by UCR senators. 
This, however, does not guarantee that the UCR will obtain a 
majority in the final vote, although it is a serious obstacle 
for the ruling Justicialist Party's desire to deal expeditiously 
with this matter. The Senate is not the only body that opposes 
the bill on patents in what is being looked on as undue U.S. 
interference in the matter. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's "message," to the 
effect that Argentina would not be allowed to join NAFTA unless 
the much-awaited law on patents was approved first, was received 
in the Chamber of Deputies like a bad odor. Before going into 
the interests at stake in this sensitive issue, let us take a 
look at the figures for the huge pharmaceutical market. 
  Argentina consumes $3 billion worth of medicines every year. 
Argentine pharmaceutical laboratories, which frequently copy 
formulas, receive $1.6 billion, and the foreign laboratories 
that own the patents keep the rest. Should the new law on 
patents be approved, this proportion will probably be reversed, 
which will significantly increase the price of medicines. 
  At one point, Pablo Challu, chairman of the Argentine 
Industrial Center of Pharmaceutical Laboratories [CILFA], made 
the exaggerated assessment that "medicines would go up 300 
percent," which prompted a swift rebuttal from government 
officials who labeled Challu's statement "sheer nonsense." 
  Rafael Flores and Felix Pesce, Justicialist Party deputies 
for Santa Cruz and Mendoza, lead the group of ruling party 
deputies who have been criticizing the bill of the executive 
branch. Pesce said: "We will pass a law that will serve the 
country's interests," and warned that "we should not play dumb, 
because there are powerful economic interests at stake.... A 
multimillion dollar business is involved." 
  Pesce rejected U.S. pressure on the grounds that "our 
Congress is an independent body which takes its own time to act 
in keeping with the people's will, which compels us to work for 
the common good without forsaking our convictions." Rafael 
Flores said: "We Argentines cannot allow health to be 
downgraded to the level of mere merchandise, because it is a 
social asset." 
  UCR Deputy Nicolas Becerra said "the United States must end 
its double extortion," and recalled that "a similar issue, which 
President Arturo Illia [1963-66] had to deal with, was the 
starting point of a tragic phase in Argentina." 
  The Socialists, led by Deputies Alfredo Bravo and Hector 
Polino, have submitted draft bills rejecting the Bill Clinton 
administration's interference with Argentina's law on patents, 
an interference "that we cannot endure silently," they firmly 
state. 
  The many voices raised in opposition are upsetting the 
administration, which is stuck in the middle and on the verge of 
being knocked out by its inability to comply with deadlines and 
to fulfill commitments as time runs out.

<F P=106> [Address by President Carlos Saul Menem at the opening of </F>
the 112th session of Congress in Buenos Aires -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I am glad that the opening of 
your ordinary sessions should be on May Day. Work, work, and 
yet more work is the key to building a great nation and a happy 
people. 
  Honorable congressmen, you have engaged in politics to seek 
the common good and to guarantee the people's endeavors through 
the rule of law. This is our challenge, a challenge that the 
three branches of government have taken up. This is our 
service, a service to the people whom we have just applauded. 
If we rise to the occasion, the people will thank us through 
their affection and adhesion, and future generations will recall 
our transit through our country's institutional life. If we 
fail to do so -- as someone said -- the people will unleash a 
thunderbolt of swift retribution. 
  Opportunities usually present themselves without much fuss. 
Let us not waste them. Now is the time. Let us turn politics 
-- this hard and lofty task -- into a space for convocation, 
integration, and proposals. The consolidation of our 
institutions, their regular operation, and the transformation of 
our economic system and its stability have paved the way for a 
historic 1994, which we, Argentines, are to witness at the 
threshold of the year 2000. This is the year of the 
constitutional reform. This amendment to the Constitution is 
underpinned by four central concepts that enable us to assert 
that this is indeed a historic year -- the consolidation of the 
democratic system, the buttressing of the independence of the 
judiciary, the strengthening of the federal system of 
government, and the promotion of Latin American and hemispheric 
integration. 
  Democracy is consolidated through an enhanced democratic 
system. The Honorable Congress enacted Law 24309 convening a 
Constituent Assembly to amend the Constitution, which the 
executive branch promulgated through Decree 2700 in 1993, and 
the people confirmed at the polls last 10 April when electing 
the Constituent Assembly members who will amend the 
Constitution. Our consolidated democracy will be strengthened 
with the amended Constitution because Argentina has changed and 
the Constitution must be updated. [passage omitted] 
  Having drawn our inspiration from the preamble of our Magna 
Carta, two constitutional presidents [Raul Alfonsin and Menem] 
took upon themselves a historical imperative with the 
responsibility the political management had conferred on them. 
Without giving up their struggle, they signed the pact this 
Honorable Congress ratified through the enactment of Law 24309 
convening the Constituent Assembly. As I have pointed out on 
several occasion, responsible leaders, good rulers, are guided 
in their actions by their concern for future generations rather 
than the forthcoming elections. 
  Honorable Congressmen, I reiterate, this is the year of the 
constitutional reform which we achieved thanks to the political 
stability that reigned throughout this decade in democracy. It 
is this stability of our institutions that enabled us to achieve 
economic stability -- the starting point for growth and social 
justice. This historic year, which will be characterized by a 
most modern political law due to the amendment to the 
Constitution, will also be a landmark year on account of 
economic growth and social justice. The amended Constitution, 
an Argentina that has taken off, and social justice are the 
banners of work that I put forth to the Argentine people and its 
representatives that are gathered here for consideration. 
  Honorable Congressmen, we have time and again said that the 
government is like an orchestra, which in order to perform well 
needs not only an appropriate coordination of the different 
musical instruments, it also needs each one to play the score 
given by the conductor. We all know that the first notes 
interpreted by our administration were in the area of economics, 
which were of course the result of deep political decisions. We 
could not set in motion the concert of development, production, 
and social justice -- a goal that our administration will never 
forsake -- without first putting our finances in order and on a 
firm footing. We have accomplished this with such great success 
that at present nobody even remembers the difference between the 
Argentine we inherited and the Argentine we have now. Stability 
-- a nearly chimerical dream in 1989 -- is now a reality that 
has so much been incorporated into our daily lives that it is no 
longer a novelty. 
  Our most bitter adversaries, even those who have reviled 
and are reviling the chosen economic path, talk about stability 
as a common good that must be protected, safeguarded, and 
respected. Regardless of the political opportunism that may 
exist in some, this is a good indication. 
  Stability belongs to all Argentine people because, even 
though it was achieved under this government's strategic 
leadership, it was made possible through the efforts and wisdom 
of our people who understood that there are no miraculous 
solutions, only work, work, and yet more work. 
  For example, it is no longer news that in the past 12 
months, 
from April 1993 to April 1994, the combined price-inflation rate 
totaled 1.3 percent. In 1989, it totaled more than 5,000 
percent. It is no longer news that the GDP grew 6.4 percent in 
1993 after investments recovered. Investments grew from 14 
percent in 1990 to 18.4 percent in 1993. It is no longer news 
that in the past three years the total GDP growth was about 26 
percent. Thus, our country has achieved the largest growth rate 
in the entire western hemisphere and ranks third in the world. 
And it is positive that all this is no longer news because the 
less the economic achievements are mentioned, the less they are 
discussed, and the clearer it is that we are on the right track. 
  I have not come to make significant announcements. What we 
did and what we will do are virtually included in this 
presidential message that you have. I have not come here to 
make significant announcements because the time for significant 
announcements in the Argentine Republic is over. 
  We are now going through a new stage that must be marked by 
an unswerving improvement of our political, economic, and social 
institutions. I urge the entire Argentine nation and its 
legitimate representatives to become involved in the successful 
completion of this stage. 
  It is true that the growth achieved has not equally reached 
everyone. We are aware that there are problems in the economies 
of various regions in our country. Nevertheless, it is 
appropriate to be very frank on this point. Farmers and 
cattlemen were hit between 1990 and 1993 by the worst 
international prices of the 20th century. We should not be 
ashamed to say this, even though now it is more comfortable to 
blame the government for all this. Our foreign trade has been 
badly deteriorated by international recession and the aggressive 
agricultural protectionism practiced by developed nations. 
  A gradual process of recovery of the prices paid for our 
products has occurred since 1993. We expect this recovery to 
continue unchanged as a consequence of the agreements achieved 
at the GATT and a growing belief in the absurd nature of 
protectionism, its high social cost for the poorest countries 
and regions, and its high fiscal cost for the nations that 
practice it. 
  The federal government is furthering a well-defined policy 
so that the fruits of growth may equitably reach all the regions 
of our country. First, this policy is included in the federal 
pact for employment, production, and growth, as it will be 
instrumental in reducing employers' social security 
contributions between 30 and 80 percent -- especially in the 
poorer provinces and those far from the federal capital. 
Obviously, Argentine provincial and regional growth will be 
greater if the federal pact is fully implemented in everything 
that pertains to deregulation, since it will enable a 
considerable reduction in labor and judicial costs. With regard 
to privatizations, it will prompt a reduction of electricity 
costs by up to 50 percent, among other things. 
  The investments being made in the provinces using domestic 
resources -- genuine resources -- are already quite significant. 
Investments will total 5 billion pesos this year. We intend to 
increase this by 300 million pesos in those provinces where 
increased private investment stemming from the full 
implementation of the federal pact makes new public works 
necessary. Within five years -- with the cooperation of this 
Honorable Congress -- national investments in the provinces will 
total 7 billion pesos. These investments will be financed 
through a deepening of the state reform and through loan 
agreements that are being negotiated with international 
organizations. To contribute to this task, I ask the Honorable 
Congress to speedily pass the bill establishing the national 
system of public investments. 
  Moreover, investments funded by the provinces' own resources 
may be increased by 2 billion pesos above that established in 
the program. To do so, provincial tax revenues and current 
expenditures should not increase more than those of the federal 
government, and provinces must adhere to the new pensions law 
and transfer the deficit of their pension funds to the federal 
government. [passage omitted] 
  The federal government will have a reviewed system of 
tariffs 
and refunds put together by 1 July. This system will come into 
force as of 1 January 1995 and will be instrumental in 
increasing between 5 and 10 percent tax rebates for manufactured 
agricultural and livestock products. To prevent any mistakes, 
the draft project will first be submitted to the National 
Economic Council for consideration. We will thus progress 
steadily toward realizing a dream the interior has cherished for 
decades -- to process the raw materials in the provinces. This 
will be buttressed with the extension of industrial productive 
centers, with the implementation of the Suppliers' Development 
Program, and with the consolidation of the successful Rural 
Change Program. 
  The deepening of the economic policy, the full 
implementation 
of the federal pact, and the public works under way will solve 
yet another great challenge of our times -- the creation of new 
jobs. We have created 280,000 new jobs per year over the past 
three years, but we must raise that number to at least 350,000. 
The contribution of this Honorable Congress -- by passing the 
new laws regulating labor relations in our countries -- is of 
prime importance. 
  Our determination to promote job-creation does not end here. 
In a little while, the executive branch will submit to this 
Honorable Congress a bill that will help to considerably 
increase the building and funding of housing for middle- and 
low-income families. This bill proposes the complete 
deregulation of the building of low-priced housing and more 
accessible financing. 
  We want to stress that we are going to come down heavily on 
tax evaders, especially on the payment of personal property and 
income taxes. 
  With regard to public spending, we will take advantage of 
the 
opportunity that will present itself with the constitutional 
reform to reduce the number of public agencies and finally do 
away with our bureaucratic government. One of the first tasks 
of the cabinet chief and ministers of state -- who following the 
reform should not exceed 12 -- will be to consolidate and 
streamline more than 20 top government agencies, including 
ministries, secretariats, and other bodies directly subordinate 
to the presidency. Their task will be to devise a more 
cost-effective and less cumbersome structure and to clearly 
define the functions and responsibilities of all officials to 
avoid superposition. This will help the government cut expenses 
by millions of pesos, which will thus be readily available to 
fund public investments and meet social needs. [passage omitted] 
  Honorable Legislators, the efforts and achievements in the 
economic sphere, I reiterate, primarily seek to generate funds 
which will be allocated for social needs. The truth is that so 
many pending needs have accumulated through the years that to 
palliate the most basic necessities of life, it is essential to 
implement small and daily measures, which if assessed in 
isolation sometimes fail to attract the attention of the mass 
media. 
  As men, Argentine, and Justicialists, we are concerned -- 
and so are our circumstantial political adversaries -- about the 
data stemming from the so-called map of poverty, even though all 
indicators show an ongoing enhancement of the quality of life of 
those living in abject squalor. As we have repeatedly said, our 
greatest efforts are geared to providing definite solutions to 
these chronic evils. We are well aware there are no over 
simplistic solutions to these problems. It is not a question of 
applying demagogic remedies, which only provide for bread now 
and bring about more hunger tomorrow. We must not -- because it 
is neither ethical nor moral -- use the hope of the neediest for 
political motives. We must not overcome poverty with charity. 
We want to wipe it out through social organization. The 
federal government is responsible for creating the economic 
conditions to eradicate marginalization, but the success of this 
endeavor requires the concerted action of all. We do not shrug 
our responsibilities. On the contrary, we are well aware that 
the key to this problem lies in the creation of new jobs and 
this is precisely what we are trying to do. 
  I would like to now turn to the main problems existing in 
the 
area of labor and social security, and the government's 
proposals to come to grips with them. To have an overall 
understanding of this issue, I will begin by making a 
categorical assertion: The Argentine labor relations system has 
not evolved at the same pace as domestic and international 
events. The prevalence of labor regulations, institutions, and 
behaviors, which go beyond what is reasonable, have much to do 
with the problems confronting us today with regard to jobs and 
working conditions. 
  Concerning the former, we are concerned by two things. 
First, our low employment rate. The importance of this is seen 
if we bear in mind that of 100 inhabitants who are in a position 
to work in Sweden, 70 have a job, whereas only 42 have a job in 
Argentina. How far we are from the goal that each one should 
produce at least what one consumes? 
  Second, unemployment, which strongly affects many of our 
homes. And even though the unemployment rate does not exceed 
average international unemployment rates, it is a factor that 
must be taken thoroughly into account. 
  On the other hand -- and I want to be very clear on this 
point -- we are not interested in importing the First World's 
flaws, but rather its virtues. The struggle against corruption 
therefore represents one of our administration's priority and 
irrevocable goals. 
  Yet another more significant point is that the Argentine 
economy, despite the record growth achieved during the past 
three years, has been unable to create enough employment. With 
respect to working conditions, the government's and society's 
concerns involve three other issues: 
  First, the lack of dynamism in collective bargaining. Trade 
unions and employers have not managed to find a way for the 
generalization, decentralization, and renewal of collective 
labor agreements, a situation that might be, at least partially, 
blamed on some legal obstacles and the shortcomings of the labor 
administration system. In this regard it is important to take 
as an example an agreement signed between SMATA [Trade Union of 
Mechanics and Related Automotive Transportation Workers] and 
General Motors. A practical and flexible agreement was reached, 
an agreement that benefits both sides. This type of responsible 
initiative, improving the legislation in this field, favors 
increased employment. 
  Second, the high rate of labor accidents. The number of 
labor accidents or illnesses is very high in our country. This 
is further aggravated by the fact that the prevention system is 
insufficient and the recovery system unsuitable, partial, and 
inappropriate. 
  Third, the excessive court involvement in labor conflicts. 
Years of state interventionism have prevented the development 
of independent practices for the solution of conflicts. This 
has resulted in an excessive, costly, and inefficient transfer 
of these conflicts to the legal field. 
  In a nutshell, the current labor system is seriously 
affecting our competitive possibilities, limiting our economy's 
ability to create jobs, and making impracticable the principles 
of solidarity, equity, and social efficiency. 
  These reasons actually explain my administration's firm 
decision to promote a substantial transformation of labor rules 
and practices, seeking to favor the creation of jobs, promote 
the competitiveness of our companies, and improve labor 
conditions. 
  Nevertheless, regardless of the emphasis we place on this 
effort, which is of a purely reformist nature, we will not 
successfully meet the pending challenges in the field of 
employment and competitiveness unless we are able to make a 
sustained and intelligent effort in the field of professional 
training. 
  It is necessary to admit that, for many years, we Argentines 
have neglected the task of training our workers, executives, 
managers, and employees. 
  I am sure that I am not exaggerating if I emphasize that our 
country's future and the future of those who inhabit it, 
economic growth, and social equity depend on the consistency of 
our efforts to make up for the time lost. 
  Therefore, right now we call upon all the social forces to 
establish the bases for a national professional training program 
that will meet the new requirements of the productive apparatus, 
and will be able to meet the professional training requirements 
of our young people and unemployed people as well as the 
permanent training of all those who are involved in the effort 
to produce goods and services. 
  Argentina today has the highest salaries in Latin America, 
and also higher than in some places elsewhere in the world. It 
also has the highest per capita income in Latin America. 
Professionalization is necessary in order to preserve these 
advantages. It is now time to make innovations in teaching 
techniques, to update our knowledge, and to place education on a 
level with the demands for new expertise and new jobs. [passage 
omitted] 
  I am saying, however, this as a man who comes from one of 
the 
provinces that has many natural limitations. Not all the 
problems that the interior has to face are the consequences of 
geographical disadvantages or of centralism. Some provinces 
have not yet completed their transformation processes, or in 
other words, their adaptation to changes. In this respect the 
national government is willing to closely cooperate with these 
provinces in order to revert the deficiencies they may have in 
their development. 
  I have also given instructions to the ministers to come up 
with solutions in accordance with the problems that have 
occurred in some of the regional economies due to the fall in 
the international prices of their products. We cannot leave to 
one side those Argentines who live in the less protected areas, 
while hoping that the local situation will be reversed. 
  The national government has thus drafted a series of actions 
with the aim of alleviating the most critical situations. Among 
these actions we must highlight the creation of the Social 
Development Secretariat, which will come directly under the 
executive branch. This secretariat's main objective is to 
guarantee that the social funds reach their appropriate 
destination. 
  In 1993, within the context of the Federal Solidarity 
Program, support was given to 98,194 families and jobs were 
found for 25,389 persons. We have also recovered the line of 
credit for housing. We are handing over the properties to the 
persons who occupy them, and are opening homes for children of 
the street. 
  With actions such as the implementation of vanguard 
legislation regarding the handicapped, the law on the womens' 
quota regarding jobs, and punishment for sexual harassment 
[applause], we have also advanced toward a more just society. 
  We have attacked the problems of the pensioners on three 
fronts. We have assumed the historical debt that the state had 
with the pensioners, thus overcoming an injustice that had been 
going on for a long time; we have give a huge push to social 
security benefits, both in the medical and social areas, 
increasing the former by 256 percent and the latter by 320 
percent during our tenure; and during the same period the 
allowed expense for each member of PAMI [Comprehensive Medical 
Assistance Plan] increased from 142 pesos to 551 pesos, which 
has indirectly been a great reinforcement for salaries and wages. 
  We have also implemented social security reform, to allow a 
definitive solution to this problem in the future. The 
administrators of pension funds will begin to work within this 
framework on 2 May. [passage omitted] 
  Honorable Congress, As I have been saying since the 
beginning 
of my tenure, and it is an expression we have listened to for a 
long time in Argentina, during all of the governments, I have no 
doubt that corruption is one of the scourges that conspire 
against social justice. 
  Corruption gives to a very few what should be given to many. 
It is a type of Robin Hood in reverse. Corruption is 
definitively an empire of bad habits and manners. That was the 
Argentine state. It was disorganized, without lucidity, 
bureaucratized, ready to carry out any kind of shady deal, 
mainly through the large state enterprises that had become a 
type of game reserve for the various levels of bureaucratic 
climbers. 
  As a structural answer for putting an end to this situation, 
we privatized enterprises and reorganized the state. We have 
said and demonstrated that we are not willing to stand for this 
type of scourge, with those who are corrupt. 
  But our efforts have not been sufficient. We will therefore 
continue to seek solutions that, with the help of the people, 
will allow us to definitely eradicate this tremendous scourge 
from the democratic life of this country. 
  The state belongs to everyone, and not, as was the case up 
until a few years ago, to but a few. To protect state assets is 
to protect every one of us. In a republic the most important 
guarantees come from an independent and agile judicial branch, 
as a slow judicial branch ends up in injustice. 
  The independence of the judicial branch, which will become 
even more strengthened with the constitutional reform, is 
guaranteed by the moral and professional qualities of our men of 
laws. But its agility is limited by serious problems of 
infrastructure. This factor must be overcome urgently, and 
therefore as I announced before this honorable Congress last 
year, the technical and financial feasibility studies have been 
completed for the new judicial city of Buenos Aires. 
  The old Puerto Madero Corporation, on the orders of the 
Building Infrastructure Commission of the national judicial 
branch, will within 30 days call for national and international 
bids for the financing, development, and administration of this 
judicial city. 
  The implementation of the procedural legislation, the 
positive results of this legislation now being observed, is 
another determining step to make the judicial branch more agile. 
  Messrs. Legislators, Nothing of what has been done will last 
without Argentina's real insertion into the world. Inward 
growth is not possible if there is no outward growth. 
  Honorable Congress, In the international context there are 
three areas on which we have focused Argentina's participation. 
In other words, on the political, economic, and ethical areas. 
  In the political sphere we have strengthened Argentina's 
presence while trying to do away with that image of 
non-commitment that we used for decades, and which isolated us 
from the great processes of history. 
  Without exaggerating, we can maintain that Argentina's 
biological clock was behind the times. For one cause or another 
it entered history 5 or 10 years behind the times. 
  A policy of permanent participation, of being an active 
protagonist, has allowed us to recover that inertia, and today 
our clocks tell the same time as those of the most important 
countries in the world. This achievement was based on a firm 
alignment with democracy, freedom, and human rights. 
  Argentina has placed itself in the vanguard of the fight 
against indifference, fully convinced that to look the other way 
has allowed the greatest horrors of this century. With this 
belief we have suggested the need for preventive diplomacy, a 
diplomacy that foresees conflicts in order to resolve them 
before they turn into confrontations. 
  We are not afraid to take action. Direct action, as has been 
proven by the more than 1,500 members that are today 
participating in UN Blue Helmet operations, while we understand 
that it is better to anticipate that than to succor. 
  In this respect, I wish to highlight the role of the Armed 
Forces, because they have undertaken a commitment and have 
complied with the nation's political desire of cooperating with 
international organizations. With efficiency and 
professionalism they were the noble ambassadors of this new 
Argentina. 
  The Argentine Army, Navy, and Air Force have demonstrated, 
as 
the security forces also have done, their full integration into 
the democratic way of life and the understanding of their new 
role looking toward the 21st century. 
  The drama of the former Yugoslavia, which I take as the most 
distressing example, is a slap in the face of all men and women 
who live on this Earth. The principle of nonintervention has 
ruled international relations for many years, but this was more 
in theory than it was real, as the violations have been 
systematic in modern history. At the dawn of the third 
millennium it is necessary that relations be made crystal clear 
and matters placed in their right context. 
  Human rights are, of course, more important than the 
principal of nonintervention, as man is more important than a 
border. This does not, however, mean a lack of respect for 
borders, which would lead to great chaos and the implementation 
of the law of the strongest. It means to give international 
organizations the prestige, respect, and necessary power to 
guarantee the rights of man. 
  In this respect Argentina maintains that the United Nations 
must be strengthened by making its General Assembly the world's 
parliament, and by making its General Secretariat its executive 
organ. 
  This is and will continue to be our country's position in 
all 
international forums, especially in the UN Security Council, 
where Argentina has been elected as a non-permanent member for 
the 1994-1995 period with the vote of 169 countries out of 175. 
  We understand that in a world that is being checkmated by 
the 
crisis -- the food crisis, the poverty crisis -- the fight 
against hunger is an obligatory crusade. We have therefore 
proposed, with very positive reception, the creation of the 
White Helmets, or International Organization of Volunteers for 
the Struggle Against Hunger. This initiative, which was 
submitted to the UN secretary general in November 1993, 
establishes that the White Helmets will channel the efforts in 
the struggle against hunger by optimizing resources and the 
necessary intelligence. 
  The transforming of the UN General Assembly into the world's 
parliament can thus be considered as the ultimate objective for 
the molding of that universality. The path toward this goal 
will be based on regional organizations. 
  The OAS, the European Parliament, and the various 
organizations for political rapprochement have been complemented 
with the creation of regional economic blocs, thus optimizing 
the productive and trade possibilities of nations. 
  Argentina plays a leading role in this process, following 
the impetus given to Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. 
Trade among Mercosur member countries has tripled. It is hoped 
that a united customs system will be achieved on 1 January 1995. 
An agreement was reached to establish a common tariffs system 
before this target date. 
  Argentine borders no longer represent a separation from 
brotherly countries, but unity for championing the interests of 
our nations. The great fatherland dreamed by Jose de San Martin 
and Simon Bolivar may no longer be a utopian goal in the 21st 
century. We endorse integration with our neighbors, but we also 
endorse integration with our other Latin American brothers and 
brothers from the entire continent. 
  Mercosur's success may be the proper path for the formation 
of a South American Free Trade Area. This proposal was 
well-received by various nations. The South American Free Trade 
Area, along with NAFTA North American Free Trade Agreement, must 
be America's pillar, an America in which free trade must become 
a reality from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. 
  Messrs. Legislators, Argentina has chosen the path of 
integration and peace, duly proving its true vocation with 
measures like signing the Tlatelolco Treaty on the prohibition 
of nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Nevertheless, a painful thorn still remains: the Malvinas 
Islands. 
  We have had a cooperative and pragmatic attitude toward the 
United Kingdom, reaching significant agreements in the field of 
fishing to preserve and rationally exploit fishing resources. 
  We have no doubts that with this cooperation policy, and 
with 
reason on our side, a fact that has become increasingly visible 
for the international community, the Malvinas Islands, through 
peaceful methods, will again become fully integrated into our 
country, which expects them like a prodigal son. [applause] 
  Honorable Congress, in this brief summary I have presented 
to 
you my administration's achievements in 1993 and the projects 
for the last year of my administration, running from 1989 to 
1995. 
  We are beginning the sixth year of the people's mandate with 
the same strength, with the same beliefs, and with the same 
hopes that we harbored on 8 July 1989. 
  Quoting Saint Paul, we have fought and have kept our faith 
alive. We have changed history, beginning with that saying: 
Argentina, arise and walk, and ending with this democracy that 
is standing and walking. 
  Our project is basically of a cultural nature. It has 
freedom of expression as an unswerving and irrevocable pillar of 
the change we have made; it has the entire country as the scene 
for our actions; it has progress as a guide for our actions; it 
has dissent as an example for our administration; it has our 
people's leading role as a custodian of the course taken; and it 
has respect for conflicts for which a solution is to be sought. 
  This is our cultural identity. It is the foundation of our 
national unity. 
  Messrs. Legislators, upon formally inaugurating the 112th 
period of legislative sessions, I, along with all Argentine 
people, urge you to remain true to yourselves, as there is not a 
single nation without hopes of grandeur. May God bless you. 
Thank you very much. [applause]

  [Excerpt] South Atlantic waters, aboard the icebreaker 
"Almirante Irizar," 1 May (NA) -- Tonight, President Carlos 
Menem emphasized that he does not harbor "the slightest doubt 
that within a very short time" Argentina will regain its 
sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. He made this remark 
during a meeting aboard the icebreaker "Almirante Irizar" with 
the relatives of seamen killed in the sinking of the cruiser 
"General Belgrano." President Menem thus appeared to be raising 
the bet on his most recent remarks on the Malvinas Islands 
issue, in which he indicated that the islands would again become 
part of sovereign Argentine territory before the year 2000. 
  The president made this remark before a group of 65 
relatives 
of seamen killed in the sinking of the warship "General 
Belgrano," which was torpedoed by the British nuclear submarine 
"Conqueror" 12 years ago. 
  In an emotional tone, Menem addressed the relatives of the 
"General Belgrano" seamen in one of the icebreaker's holds a few 
minutes after boarding the ship, within the framework of a 
tribute that the national government is paying -- for the first 
time -- to war veterans and relatives of the seamen killed on 
the "General Belgrano." The tribute in the South Atlantic 
waters is scheduled to end tomorrow. 
  The president arrived in Ushuaia, from which town the 
icebreaker was sailing, at 1735, and an hour later went to the 
naval base, where he boarded the "Almirante Irizar." 
  The president was joined by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella; 
Defense Minister Oscar Camilion; Army Chief of Staff Martin 
Balza; Navy Chief of Staff Enrique Molina Pico; Juan Paulik, the 
Air Force chief of staff; Tierra del Fuego Governor Jose 
Estabillo; and Public Function Secretary Claudia Bello. Bello, 
along with Jorge Baeza, the Defense Ministry military affairs 
secretary, organized the tribute, which was called "Operation 
Memorial." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Aboard the icebreaker "Almirante Irizar," 2 May 
(NA) -- President Carlos Menem has underlined that if the United 
Kingdom were to authorize Argentine citizens to travel to the 
Malvinas Islands, he would be "the first to visit" to pay homage 
to the soldiers who fell in the 1982 war. 
  The president voiced his willingness to travel to the 
islands 
for the first time while sailing toward the place where a 
memorial ceremony was held this morning, in honor of the members 
of the Argentine Navy who died in the sinking of the cruiser 
"General Belgrano." During a dialogue with the journalists who 
accompanied him on this voyage, Menem said that "if we were 
allowed to travel to the Malvinas I would be the first to go 
there." 
  In justifying today's homage, 12 years after the war was 
concluded, the president vindicated the war veterans and 
recalled that he felt "a sort of shame" at the end of the war. 
He noted that "the soldiers who had left to fight were welcomed 
back through the rear door, rather than in the manner they 
deserved." He went on to say that "it is the government's duty 
to remember those who fell in the sinking of the `General 
Belgrano,' as it allows their relatives to pay tribute to their 
beloved ones." 
  With regard to the War Veterans Federation's demand that the 
sinking of the "Belgrano" be declared a "war crime," the head of 
state stated that Argentina "has long considered it to be so. 
For us, it was a war crime. It was a ship that was sailing 
outside the exclusion zone with no purpose of engaging in 
battle, and the word was given to sink it. This was a highly 
irresponsible and irrational decision by those who were 
conducting the war from the British Empire," he said. 
  Menem advised that this tribute to the "General Belgrano" 
and 
its dead "should not be a matter for concern for Great Britain," 
as Argentina has decided to resort to "diplomatic means" to 
recover its sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. 
  Menem took advantage of this episode to once again label 
Margaret Thatcher's remarks in Chile "sheer nonsense." Thatcher 
said that the Argentines owe democracy to the British. "The 
United Kingdom should be applauding this homage to the heroes of 
the Belgrano," he remarked, remarking that "after the two world 
wars, they have gotten tired of paying tribute to those who 
fought for their country." 
  On the evening of 1 May the president dined with a group of 
relatives of the seamen who died in the sinking of the 
"Belgrano." At approximately 2200 local time, the sea was still 
calm and the temperature was 0 degrees Celsius, in contrast with 
the warm atmosphere that reigned inside the icebreaker. During 
the early hours of the morning, however, the icebreaker had to 
make its way through more turbulent waters, which made the 
passage difficult due to the constant movement of the vessel. 
  During the memorial ceremony on the morning of 2 May, the 
temperature was 1 degree below zero and it was snowing 
continuously, with strong gales and precipitation. Despite 
these weather conditions the ceremony took place on the landing 
deck. 
  Menem pointed out that "despite the fact that 12 years have 
elapsed, the memorial ceremony has reawakened the appreciation 
and memories of those who gave up their lives for the country."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 1 May (NA) -- A report submitted to 
the Chamber of Deputies on 1 May, in which the Ministry of 
Foreign Relations, International Trade, and Worship takes stock 
of the past year, states that the U.S. decision to authorize the 
sale of materiel to equip the Argentine Air Force constitutes a 
milestone in bilateral relations. 
  It further stated that "it implies an express 
acknowledgement 
of the trust that our country has managed to obtain thanks to 
its security policy." It added that "current cooperation 
between the two countries is characterized by mutual commitment 
to the regional control of weapons, nonproliferation, and 
participation in peacekeeping missions." 
  With regard to relations with Washington, the Argentine 
Foreign Ministry recalled Bill Clinton's remarks, on the 
occasion of Argentine President Carlos Menem's state visit to 
the United States, to the effect that "Argentina might join 
NAFTA in the medium future." 
  Also in the framework of relations with the United States, 
the Foreign Ministry pointed out that an agreement on the 
establishment of a fund for the Americas and a managing 
commission for childhood was signed between the two countries on 
27 September 1993." [no opening quotation marks as received] 
  As for relations between Argentina and the UK following the 
conflict over the Malvinas Islands, the official report stated 
that "on the occasion of the 161st anniversary of Great 
Britain's illegitimate occupation" on 3 January, Argentina 
"firmly reasserted that it will never renounce its rights over 
the islands." 
  To that effect the report went on to say that "it reiterated 
its adamant intention of continuing to make headway in its 
dialogue and negotiations with the UK, in order to strengthen 
mutual trust and enhance bilateral cooperation in the southwest 
Atlantic." The Foreign Ministry stressed that Argentina "has 
offered to the UK Government to clear the Malvinas Islands of 
the mines laid during the 1982 war." 
  The official report noted that, within the framework of the 
talks held with England and Northern Ireland during 1993, the 
parties discussed the implications of deep sea fishing for 
conservation, and reviewed the functioning of the reciprocal 
communications system. 
  As for fishing zones, the report added that on 7 May 1993 
the 
Argentine Government rejected "the extension by the UK of its 
alleged jurisdiction over the territorial waters of South 
Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands." 
  Argentina's incorporation into the UN Security Council on 1 
January 1994 was another subject broached in the report. It 
underscored the importance of Argentina's participation in 
conflicts like those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Middle East, 
Haiti, El Salvador, and Guatemala, among others. 
  Concerning Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the 
Foreign 
Ministry's report pointed out that trade between the four member 
countries added up to some $9 billion last year.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 1 May (NA) -- The Programming and 
Coordination Secretariat for the Prevention of Drug Abuse and 
for the Antinarcotics Struggle today released its annual report, 
which states that "the illegal drug trade has gotten worse in 
recent years." 
  Alberto Lestelle's secretariat reported: "Argentina could 
hardly remain unaffected by the worsening of the problem," as 
"one cannot delude oneself by downplaying the power of these 
organizations, which have considerable advantages over 
government organizations, financial power being one of the main 
ones." 
  It added that exchanging cars stolen in Argentina for drugs 
from Bolivia (cocaine) and Paraguay (marijuana) has "become 
another established criminal activity." The secretariat 
explained that "these two drugs are practically the only ones 
that circulate through and are consumed in Argentina." 
  According to the official report, "the deployment of drug 
trafficking cartels to Latin American Southern Cone countries 
constitutes a regional and national threat which could shortly 
lead to extremely dangerous developments." 
  The reported stated: "As the amount of drugs in transit 
increases, so will local consumption, as illegal operations are 
frequently paid for in drugs which must, therefore, be divided 
into individual doses and sold in the country of transit." The 
report also warned that "corruption, which is one of the 
inevitable consequences of the drug trade, tends to take 
advantage of Argentina's economic opening and market freedom."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 3 May (DPA) -- Colombian Foreign 
Affairs Minister Noemi Sanin today asked the U.S. Government to 
normalize judicial relations between the two countries. 
Judicial relations were partially suspended by Washington 
following a disagreement with Colombian Prosecutor General 
Gustavo de Greiff. 
  The request was made after the Colombian Government told the 
United States that "under no circumstance" can it accept that De 
Greiff be criticized by U.S. State Department officials, who 
have publicly stated they do not trust him and therefore have 
stopped sending to Santa Fe de Bogota evidence against drug 
traffickers. 
  Sanin, in statements to the press, indicated that Colombia 
and the United States should uphold together the struggle 
against the common enemy, drug trafficking, which gets an upper 
hand when judicial authorities do not cooperate. Colombia's 
rejection of criticism against De Greiff was included in a note 
sent by Sanin to the U.S. State Department. The U.S. State 
Department on 18 April sent a letter to the Cesar Gaviria 
government denouncing the prosecutor general's behavior. 
  Washington's protest was prompted by a letter De Greiff sent 
the U.S. judge in charge of the case of Colombian drug 
trafficker Dandenis Munoz. In the letter De Greiff said that 
Colombia had no pending charges against this criminal concerning 
the attack against an Avianca airplane, which killed 107 people 
in November 1989. 
  The prosecutor general's letter was sent at the request of 
Munoz's lawyer. Munoz is serving a six-year sentence in New 
York for using illegal identification. U.S. political and 
judicial circles believe there was "improper meddling" by De 
Greiff in the case. 
  The U.S. Government, through the State Department protest 
note, criticized De Greiff and cast doubt on his resolve to 
fight drug trafficking, thus increasing tension over the past 
few months between U.S. judicial authorities and the Colombian 
prosecutor general. 
  The quarrel began in 1993 when de Greiff said in a news 
conference in the United States that it would be good to develop 
ways to legalize drug trafficking in view of what he called 
"little interest" by developed countries to halt consumption and 
at the same time reduce the mafia's economic power. 
  When referring to the protest note sent to the U.S. State 
Department, Sanin said that despite the fact the Gaviria 
government has conceptual differences with de Greiff, it does 
not accept that the prosecutor general be cast under a bad 
light, especially on an international level. 
  "Colombia does not accept, under any circumstance, 
statements 
against the prosecutor general, who is an efficient and properly 
qualified person, committed to fighting crime and drug 
trafficking," the foreign minister said. 
  Likewise, Sanin's diplomatic note criticized the position of 
U.S. Senator John Kerry, who invited a criminal to a 
Congressional session, who accused the Colombian Government, 
politicians, and the media of having been "corrupted" by the 
mafia's narco-trafficking money.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 3 
May. 
  The Colombian fishing sector has established the Chamber of 
Fishing Industry [Camara de la Industria Pesquera], presided 
over by marine biologist Armando Hernandez Rodriguez. The 
chamber's board of directors includes representatives of the 
firms that catch, process, and sell 80 percent of the tuna, 
shrimp, and lobster produced in the country. Those firms are: 
Atunes de Colombia, C.I.; Oceanos, C.I.; Frigopesca, C.I.; 
Vikingos de Colombia; Compania Pesquera Colombiana; Frigogan; 
and Promotora de Pesca Colombiana. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 29 Apr 94 p 5b) 
  The National Administrative Department of Statistics, Dane, 
reported on 2 May a 2.37-percent inflation rate had been 
recorded in April, increasing the inflation rate to 11.92 
percent for the first four months of the year. The accumulated 
inflation rate for the past 12 months was 23.94 percent. The 
hike in the cost of living in April is due to the food, health, 
and housing sectors, the Dane report added. (Paris AFP in 
Spanish 0235 GMT 2 May 94) 
  Business leaders have reported the devaluation of the 
Venezuelan bolivar could prompt an increase in contraband to 
Colombia, because it has caused Venezuelan products to be more 
economical for Colombians. National production cannot be 
protected against increasing economic competition from Venezuela 
due to the commercial agreement signed between both countries; 
furthermore, the fall of the Venezuelan currency has also made 
Colombian products more expensive in Venezuela and could cause a 
decrease in Colombian exports to Venezuela. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT 2 May 94)

  [Text] Antidrug forces have concluded that the most 
powerful drug trafficking organizations operate at least 50 
illegal airstrips located in strategic spots in the nine 
Peruvian coca producing areas, which Interior Ministry analysts 
consider critical narcoterrorist areas. 
  Despite the arrest of Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, 
known as "Vaticano," drug trafficking in the Maranon River basin 
has not only remained active, but has also expanded because of 
the few antidrug operations and little infrastructure in the 
region, particularly in the departments of Cajamarca and 
Amazonas, which produce coca and poppies. 
  In recent operations, however, antidrug agents have seized 
large shipments of basic cocaine paste. The largest seizures 
were made in Piura Department, while 53 people involved with 
drug trafficking have been arrested. 
  Twenty illegal airstrips were spotted in the Huarmey sandy 
zone; in the Quiches, Chingalpo, and Siguas (Ancash) tablelands; 
in Imaga, Santa Maria de Nieva, Bagua, Rodriguez de Mendoza, and 
Chachapoyas (Amazonas); and in the valleys of Balbas, Celendin, 
Encanada, Chilete, and Tembladera (Cajamarca). 
  Analysts have said that because of the geographical features 
of the region in which the airstrips are located in the 
Cajamarca zone, only expert pilots flying planes fitted with 
sophisticated equipment can successfully land in the Chilete, 
Tembladera, and Encanada ravines. 
<H5>  In Alto Mayo Valley </H5>
  During the last couple of weeks, antidrug forces have also 
discovered that basic cocaine paste trafficking feeds mainly on 
the drugs coming from Alto Mayo Valley and going to Chiclayo, 
Trujillo, Piura, and Tumbes, especially by land and through the 
highway joining Moyobamba and the capital of Lambayeque. 
  According to the sources, the drugs are taken from Moyobamba 
to Rioja and from here to Bagua, where they are rearranged for 
continuing on their course to Jaen, Olmos, and finally Chiclayo. 
This way drug traffickers make sure that their merchandise 
cannot be easily discovered. 
  The sources explained that part of the basic cocaine paste 
is 
sold in small amounts in Chiclayo and Trujillo, and the rest is 
refined in laboratories operating in those places. The drugs are 
then taken to Ecuador. 
  On the other hand, an antidrug brigade has over the past two 
weeks been searching the region of Celendin (Cajamarca) and Luya 
(Amazonas), following an increase in the number of flights of 
small planes, presumably of Colombian origin. There is evidence 
that the drugs that are being sent abroad are produced by the 
organization of Elias Chavez Penaherrera, known as "Cristo"--one 
of "Vaticano's" brothers. 
  During the last operation in the zone, the police seized 
105.579 kg of basic cocaine paste. The larger seizures were made 
in Cajamarca and Lambayeque, where drug traffickers were found 
to be in possession of 20 automatic arms, three vehicles, and 
two houses where they were keeping 300 kg of coca leaves that 
were about to be processed. The traffickers also had other 
substances and plastic bags, which are used for their criminal 
activities. 
  Interior Ministry sources have said that drug trafficking in 
northern Peru continues to supply Ecuador, and that to this end 
it uses public passenger transportation vehicles and private 
vehicles as well.

  [Text] People got the impression that the mafias had 
reduced their activities in mid-February, after personnel from 
Dinandro [Antidrug Division], the FAP [Peruvian Air Force], and 
the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] seized 3.5 tonnes of 
cocaine paste in Boca Manu (Madre de Dios). 
  Recent intelligence reports, however, state that drug 
trafficking organizations are using new drug gathering centers 
in border districts, and have managed to get many miners who had 
been working on the banks of the Tambopata River to swap gold 
prospecting for the drug trade. 
  During operations carried out over the past few weeks, it 
became clear that drug traffickers have established their drug 
trade centers in the border districts of Inapari (Tahuamanu) and 
Santa Maria de Fatima (Tambopata), located 15 km from the 
Chiringayoc checkpoint. Army and police agents arrested 27 
traffickers here, among them Peruvians, Colombians, and 
Brazilians, and seized 1,051 kg of basic cocaine paste and 150 
kg of washed cocaine paste ready to be shipped to Brazil, from 
where the drug would be shipped to Colombia and the United 
States. 
  The arrested traffickers confessed that after the operation 
at Boca Manu airport, they had received orders from the bosses 
in the Colombian firms to move to the town of Diamante and were 
using the landing strip located near the old "Lagarto" naval 
base to ship the drugs abroad. Interior Ministry experts 
explained that the drug cartels, in their attempt to disperse 
and dodge the Army, Dinandro, and DEA operations, have decided 
to vary the centers to gather and ship drugs abroad and to seek 
new ones, thus dodging the authorities' surveillance and turning 
Madre de Dios into a key point for trafficking in cocaine paste 
and cocaine hydrochloride. 
  Moreover, drug enforcement forces continue to confiscate 
coca 
leaves in Cusco and Puno Departments. Traffickers have been 
transporting coca leaves in small quantities by train, truck, 
and bus from the growing centers in La Convencion, Amgaraes, 
Lares, Quispicanchis, and Inambari to the higher Puno provinces 
(Carabaya, Juliaca, and Sandia) where there are clandestine 
laboratories for manufacturing cocaine paste and cocaine. 
  Part of these drugs are smuggled out of the country across 
the Bolivian and Brazilian borders, while the rest is sent to 
Arequipa, Moquegua, and Tacna for domestic consumption and to be 
sold in Chile and Argentina. The cocaine hydrochloride is 
transported by "mules" traveling in public transportation 
facilities disguised as tourists going to Arica. 
  Some days ago Cusco and Puno drug enforcement forces seized 
one tonne of coca leaves being transported in regional buses, 
concealed under staple foods. According to Interior Ministry 
sources, a similar quantity (900 kg) of cocaine paste, 
manufactured in inaccessible areas in Juliaca, was seized in 
Arequipa and Tacna. 
  Intelligence agents agree that Arica has become one of the 
most important centers of the region for the "laundering" of 
narcodollars. There is proof that "mules" are paid to transport 
the drugs to Chile with modern vehicles, pickups, and other 
types of vehicles. 
  The organizations involved in illegal drug trafficking thus 
attract those who wish to become the owners of modern 
transportation means overnight, which they then give to third 
parties to run, as it is a fact that whoever engages in drug 
trafficking ends up dead.

  [Text] Lima, 3 May (EFE) -- About 55,000 state hospital 
employees today began a three-day strike to protest the 
"miserable" wage increase recently granted by the government. 
  Also 10,000 workers from the state oil company returned 
today 
to work after a 24-hour strike. 
  Consuelo Febrero, a leader of the hospital employees, said 
that during the 72-hour strike specially appointed personnel 
will take care of the emergency situations in the hospitals. 
  The strikers want higher wages, the release of the union 
leaders under arrest, and the state hospitals not to be 
privatized. 
  The workers said that Health Minister Jaime Freundt does not 
want to listen to their demands, and this is the reason for the 
strike. 
  In addition about 10,000 workers form the State Petroleum 
Agency returned to work today after holding a 24-hour strike. 
  According to union leader Miguel Freytas, the workers oppose 
the selling of the state oil enterprise to a private company, 
because the enterprise made a profit of $86 million in 1993 and 
profits may reach $200 million in 1994. 
  The union said it will call for longer strikes, and then for 
an indefinite general strike, to keep the State Petroleum Agency 
under state ownership and maintain the labor force of 10,000 
workers.

  [Text] Violent clashes between workers and police during 
the general strike ended yesterday with the provisional result 
of one peasant dead and some 30 individuals injured and bruised. 
According to several sources, this was the first general strike 
in the country in 36 years. 
  The three labor federations, CNT [National Workers 
Federation], CUT [United Workers Trade Union Federation], and 
CPT [Paraguayan Confederation of Workers], said the strike was 
"a total success," adding that the measure was respected by 80 
to 85 percent of unionized workers and employees. President 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy, Interior Minister Carlos Podesta, and 
Justice Minister Juan Manuel Morales said the strike was a 
"total failure." 
  Workers started mobilizing on the night of 1 May. 
Demonstrations became more serious during the morning when 
unionized workers occupied strategic points of access to the 
capital, Ciudad del Este, and Hernandarias, among other 
crossroads. 
  According to spokesmen for public transport companies, bus 
drivers halted most of the bus service in the capital and Ciudad 
del Este around midmorning because demonstrators were attacking 
buses. 
  The Army moved tanks from their base in Cerrito to the 1st 
Corp barracks. An armored helicopter overflew highways entering 
the capital and over Calle Ultima, alarming the population for a 
couple of hours. 
  Student Sebastian Larrosa was shot in the head and died 
instantly during the blockade and march on Highway 3, near 
Tacuara, some 200 km north of Asuncion, yesterday morning. ABC 
COLOR journalist Mariano Godoy was wounded in the back by 
another shot during the same demonstration. 
  Police Superintendent Pablo Villar, Public Relations 
Director, confirmed the death of the student following a clash 
with security forces. He also reported that six policemen were 
wounded during the clash. Peasants were dispersed with tear 
gas. Interior Minister Carlos Podesta emphasized that the 
peasant demonstrators used guns against the police first. 
  NOTICIAS reporter Celso Aguilera witnessed the incident and 
told radio stations that two peasant demonstrators were wounded 
in the forehead and the right arm, respectively. 
  Aguilera said: "An ABC COLOR colleague and I mingled with 
the 
peasants to take pictures but I withdrew from the area when I 
saw the police were going to use force to repress the 
demonstration. I saw the police turning their weapons on the 
peasants." Police Superintendent Villar said four policemen 
were wounded in the capital. 
  In Ciudad del Este, striking workers demonstrated through 
the 
city center and blockaded streets until they were repressed by 
the police. ABC COLOR, NOTICIAS, and ULTIMA HORA reporters and 
photographers were hit and bruised during the repression. Some 
500 strikers gathered in Pedro Juan Caballero. Liberal Party 
Mayor Filemon Valdez criticized them for their lack of numbers. 
In Encarnacion, the strike was 60 percent effective but there 
was no violence. 
  Transport Vice Minister Juan Wenninger said some 200 buses 
were damaged by stones thrown by demonstrators, adding that 
passengers were injured by flying glass. President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy, speaking in Uberaba, Brazil, where he is participating 
in a cattle fair, said: "The strike was a failure." According 
to the Federation For Production, Industry, and Trade (Feprinco) 
the strike was 50 percent effective. 
  Early on 2 May, students who joined the strike burned tires 
on Eusebio Ayala Avenue, outside the Asuncion National 
University university campus. 
  Army Communications Director Colonel Carlos Medina issued a 
message around noon yesterday saying that the Armed Forces were 
ready to support the police if they were overpowered by 
demonstrators. 
  The police fired into the air and used water cannons against 
demonstrators who tried to prevent the movement of vehicles in 
various points of access to the capital. Buses practically 
stopped operating after the initial confrontations. 
  CUT President Alan Flores asked workers demonstrating on 
Calle Ultima to move to the Fetraban [Bank Workers Federation] 
headquarters for an afternoon rally once the news of the 
peasant's death and the wounded in Tacuara became known. Flores 
characterize Wasmosy's government as "fascist" after witnessing 
what he thought was excessive police violence. "Only the 
totalitarian minds of people who understand state terrorism can 
accept the shooting of a fellow worker for the simple act of 
demonstrating," Flores said. 
  Secretary General Eduardo Ojeda said he regretted the 
incidents, adding that the protest was organized "to dignify the 
working class." Paraguayan Industrial Union President Arturo 
Jara Avelli blamed the violence on strikers and characterized 
their leaders as "union terrorists." 
  Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone reported that 
commercial activities dropped to 60 percent of usual levels. He 
added, however, that 90 percent of shops and industries opened 
their doors. Most parents in the capital and the interior of 
the country preferred not to send their children to school to 
avoid the risk of violence or for lack of transportation.

  [Text] The 290 kg of crystallized cocaine that National 
Narcotics Directorate (Dinar) personnel recently seized in 
Vallemi is allegedly linked to the ongoing exchange of 
Paraguayan cattle for high-grade Bolivian cocaine. Police 
sources released this information yesterday, adding that the 
backgrounds of several local cattle breeders are currently under 
investigation. 
  It is assumed that the cocaine is being brought into 
Paraguay 
and exchanged for cattle, preferably cows capable of surviving 
and reproducing in the Bolivian climate, so as to replenish 
Bolivia's cattle stock. 
  Drug enforcement agents arrested Paraguayans Victoriano 
Gomez, 41, ID card No. 2,919,135; and Juan Albino Frutos, 44, a 
tradesman born in Bahia Negra, ID card No. 1,788,598. The two 
were carrying 20 kg of crystallized cocaine en route to Europe, 
where the black market value of the shipment is over $20 million. 
  Initial reports indicated that the discovery and seizure of 
the narcotics was possible thanks to information that the U.S. 
Embassy in Asuncion supplied to Dinar. 
  According to rumors, the U.S. Embassy received encrypted 
information on this affair via satellite from the Department of 
State in Washington, following an investigation ordered by the 
Pentagon. 
  Reliable sources have indicated that the Clinton 
administration is closely following South American drug 
enforcement programs, especially in Bolivia and Paraguay, an 
area which is considered to be "of interest for the security of 
the United States." 
  It would seem that the recent seizure in Vallemi awakened a 
great deal of interest among Washington officials because the 
"cattle meat" connection is involved, sources close to the case 
said. Meanwhile, Dinar sources have been saying that the 
seizure in Vallemi was the result of patient investigations 
carried out in Fuerte Olimpo and Bahia Negra.

<F P=106> [Interview with Banking Superintendent Gustavo Roosen by </F>
Carlos Croes; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Many people asked me what was Gustavo Roosen's role 
as the president of the Republic's "super commissioner" for 
financial problems. I decided to ask Gustavo Roosen directly. 
This was how the interview developed. 
  [Croes] What has happened? 
  [Roosen] We thought that with peace in this large area, the 
others would ease up a bit, but this has not been the case. It 
did not work out this way. The situation has become very 
complicated. I hope my familiarity with the financial sector and 
the relations I developed as president of the Central Bank of 
Venezuela will allow me to find an agreement that will change 
our current image, which has been nefarious to the confidence of 
account holders and users of the intermediation system. This 
situation has led us to figures of such magnitude that it really 
should worry all Venezuelans. 
  [Croes] What is your role? 
  [Roosen] Look, basically, I would say I am a facilitator. 
The 
moment one thinks one has a task that is different from other 
government institutions, one is condemned to failure. There are 
four government tasks that have to prevail in time and two of 
them have been bolstered in the recent Bank Law: the General 
Bank Superintendency and Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking 
Protection Fund]. I would say the first point of agreement has 
to be with all sectors, including the financial ones in this 
case, to strengthen the government's supervisory ability, which 
has been the true cause of this problem. The second is a 
thorough reorganization of Fogade to allow it to capitalize 
appropriately, justify its accounts with the Central Bank, and 
balance those accounts in the public deficit. 
  [Croes] What does this reorganization imply? 
  [Roosen] The Public Credit Law has not been implemented. All 
the subsidies have been awarded through advances on future bank 
contributions. The Public Credit Law has to be implemented for 
Fogade to capitalize efficiently and for those documents to be 
placed in the banking sector. Those Fogade documents [words 
indistinct] in the system, will attenuate the impact of the 
advances made on the Central Bank where they appear as insolvent 
balances accruing interest. Fogade's financial structure now has 
to be reorganized with the help of experts and with a bit of 
backing by this superintendency. I also hope other Venezuelans 
of goodwill will help. In addition, the rest of the banking 
sector must lend its support by providing top-notch executives 
that will allow us to harmonize the administrative councils of 
the banks that are being subsidized. The reports on the 
distressed banks, which are to be issued by those councils, will 
determine if they are to be reorganized or liquidated. Up to now 
the group of people who have been helping in the Banco Latino 
case have dedicated entire days, the Holy Week holidays, and 
more to this endeavor. We have to strengthen this work with 
people from other banks as this will give the group a much more 
heterogeneous character. 
  [Croes] Now from the information that you have, do you think 
there are banks in this group that can recover? 
  [Roosen] I don't know because the information I have is very 
contradictory. From Fogade I received a report in the evening, 
and we were discussing these things at Miraflores. It is 
presumed these banks still maintain more or less 40 percent of 
their base of deposits. We believe this is not even true, based 
on comments in hallways, cocktail parties, and funerals, which 
is where people learn about things in Venezuela, but there is no 
accurate information. Therefore, any speculation on my part 
would be inappropriate. 
  [Croes] Don't the papers they have given to Fogade to 
support 
those contributions have important economic backing? 
  [Roosen] I cannot evaluate a situation based on assumptions. 
I am under the impression they have given out so many papers, 
they must be delivering papers that do not have a partial value 
of 100 percent. I personally think--my intuition tells me--I do 
not know today that the level of subsidies is such a number and, 
therefore, the disbursement of the portfolio should be so much. 
Already the loan portfolio that is most difficult to recover 
must be disbursed to Fogade as a guarantee. Thus, those holdings 
cannot have the same value as "top loan portfolios" ["lomito"]. 
By now, it must have different kinds of portfolios and that, of 
course, represents in the end a problem those banks will have to 
account for in their reorganization processes. Now, if the 
reorganization shows there is a possibility the bank will float, 
that it can be effectively managed, well, let us hope for this. 
However, I am afraid some of them will not have.... 
  [Croes] What is the solidarity agreement? 
  [Roosen] It is a solidarity agreement on the financial issue 
particularly. It must determine the support bases required from 
the rest of the banks; the intermediation mechanisms that could 
be used to replace the zero-coupon bond, totally or partially. 
What kind of cooperation will be asked from the rest of the 
banking sector in terms of human resources; what type of 
structure must we implement to organize Fogade financially; what 
kind of foreign support must we seek to give meaning to the 
spirit, purpose, and objective of the Bank Law regarding the 
supervision or autonomy capacity of the Superintendency. These 
would be needed bases to achieve consensus that could make 
progress tomorrow in a meeting with a group of bankers. This 
could perhaps crystallize Sunday in some kind of agreement 
establishing the intention to make specific things, restoring 
confidence, and ending this pattern that led us to a crisis. 
  [Croes] What specific things, for instance? 
  [Roosen] In addition to the reorganization of Fogade and the 
Superintendency, those specific things are the on-loan transfer 
of top-notch executives to create administrative boards at the 
assisted banks, the search for alternatives such as treasury 
bills to sell financial surpluses, the objective discussion of 
interest rates, the current margin of intermediation and how to 
tackle them. Others are the level of delinquent loan portfolios 
that may exist in a bank, in all banks, and what are the 
possible solutions. These should be the basis of the agreement 
to deal with the situation we are faced with today. 
  [Croes] Those banks have, in fact, undergone intervention. 
  [Roosen] Those banks, if you will, have been nationalized. 
They have not undergone intervention because, Carlos, that is a 
very specific legal word. 
  [Croes] Of course. They have been nationalized. However, the 
question I keep asking myself is if all of these banks are 
salvageable or if all of them are liquid? What are we going to 
do about this...are we going to continue spending money? 
  [Roosen] I cannot give you an opinion on something of which 
I 
am not aware. I am under the impression, if my intuition is 
accurate, that some of the banks might be salvageable through 
mergers, some of them may have critical assets of their own to 
survive and others may have no other alternative but liquidation. 
  [Croes] What is your perception of the system's situation in 
general? 
  [Roosen] My perception is that it is lethargic; on the one 
hand, you have subsidies [auxilios] and on the other, the zero 
coupon bonds, which have eliminated financial intermediation in 
the country. 
  [Croes] But what would the banks do without the zero coupon 
bonds? 
  [Roosen] I would prefer at any given time to seek a 
concerted 
effort regarding the issuance of treasury bonds that would give 
the state the liquidity to undertake public projects or pay 
debts so the economy will begin to move again, instead of 
uselessly sterilizing money at a rate of 54 percent at the 
Central Bank. 
  [Croes] Is that not what is currently saving those banks 
that 
are totally inactive because of the productive apparatus's 
recession? 
  [Roosen] Suppose for a minute that you could update all of 
the treasury bonds, which have fallen behind and that the banks 
agree to purchase the treasury bonds as a mechanism for 
placement of their excess cash; the treasury bonds are intended 
to foster investment or public spending, right? While the zero 
coupon bonds are intended by definition for sterilization at the 
Central Bank and will serve no purpose at all. 
  [Croes] This means you would replace the zero coupon bonds 
with the treasury bonds? 
  [Roosen] That is one example. 
  [Croes] Is the atmosphere within the government appropriate 
for that plan? 
  [Roosen] I believe so. 
  [Croes] Does the post of commissioner entail special duties? 
Are they established in any decree? 
  [Roosen] They are not established. I told you at the 
beginning of our conversation that in my opinion the 
commissioner should be a person who will facilitate the unity of 
the four state institutions that are in charge of financial 
matters, who will have a nonfinancial, nonbanker view of the 
interior of the financial institutions, who will attempt to 
achieve certain basic agreements...a course of action to regain 
confidence in the system. 
  [Croes] How is Banco Latino doing? 
  [Roosen] Very well. Truly very well. The final great test 
came on 20 April when, as you may recall, we opened the Liquid 
Assets Fund in which we had 147 billion bolivares in deposits 
and from which we expected a considerable flight of money 
prompted by uncertainty. Contrary to international experience, 
however, that was not the case. People came in to renew their 
accounts, they closed some of them, but the following day's 
compensation rates were quite modest compared to the withdrawals 
we expected. 
  [Croes] Have withdrawals by people who had less than 10 
million bolivares stopped? 
  [Roosen] That situation has totally normalized. 
  [Croes] What percentage of the deposits remains? 
  [Roosen] I cannot say exactly, but it is very high. I had 
even said publicly that international experience shows that up 
to 40 percent of the deposits would be lost. I do not have our 
figures but I would say that very little of the deposits were 
lost. 
  [Croes] When one sees, for example, a document from the 
General Bank Superintendency which states that there are 
subsidized banks that have lost 14 times their capital...how can 
a bank like that be saved? 
  [Roosen] No. I do not see how their current shareholders can 
believe so...unless these gentlemen are willing to bring in 14 
times their capital and reincorporate it here. I am looking at 
this from the viewpoint of something similar to what the Banking 
Superintendency did; the state takes over the losses, saves the 
shares that can be recovered, and then sells them. 
  [Croes] It would take the place of all the shareholders? 
  [Roosen] Of course, from my viewpoint that is an obvious 
condition.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pedro Paris Montesinos, president of </F>
Venezuela's Democratic Action, AD, by Carlos Fernandez, host of 
the program "24 Hours," at the network's studio in Caracas -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Fernandez] Yesterday, we learned of the general 
guidelines of the economic strategy President Rafael Caldera's 
government will apparently adopt. Initiatives that will dictate 
the government's actions in the next five years were outlined. 
That will be the first topic up for discussion with AD President 
Dr. Pedro Paris Montesinos. What is your initial opinion about 
what was learned yesterday and the promulgation of the law on 
concessions to which the Venezuelan president gave great 
importance and relevance? We welcome Dr. Pedro Paris Montesinos, 
and let us hear his opinion about this and many other topics. 
  [Paris] Thank you, Carlos. I am very pleased to be back on 
your program after being away for several months. We are here, 
and, as usual, we are prepared to answer your questions, which 
are always intelligently formulated, in fact, we briefly 
reviewed, on the government's behalf, the preliminary ideas 
outlined by Dr. Berend Roosen [chairman of the National Council 
for Commerce and Services] concerning a logical plan to resolve 
the country's prevailing financial crisis. We asked a party 
technical committee to make a thorough, reflective, and 
objective analysis of these proposals so we may officially issue 
our opinion on this matter. The committee is working, and I 
believe the CEN [National Executive Council] will receive a 
report from its members next week. 
  I believe it is timely and advisable for the government to 
define a coherent line of action, and I have said this to the 
media. We should have no contradictions on the decisions we 
adopt, because--far from helping to create confidence and 
dispelling the prevailing doubts and confusion among the 
Venezuelan people about this and other issues--we believe it 
would be positive to define all this. 
  [Fernandez] We might say some steps are being taken: the 
overall tax reforms and the Congress-approved laws the president 
of the Republic must now promulgate. 
  [Paris] Exactly. It was.... 
  [Fernandez, interrupting] Also, what the economy minister 
announced yesterday. 
  [Paris] Exactly. It was an AD initiative, meaning, to 
propose 
in Congress that the president of the Republic be given special 
powers so he could adopt emergency economic measures. This was 
defined through the government's own plan, and the government 
should issue those laws within this period, which is relatively 
brief, 30 days. 
  I was quite pleased to witness the signing of the document 
for the promulgation of the decree on concessions. It is quite 
thorough, and its outlook is very positive. The Concessions Law 
that was issued in the past and was still in effect mostly 
granted concessions on finished works, meaning, to manage what 
was already built rather than to build them, which is what the 
goal sought by a true concessions law should be. 
  I think the government's guidelines show it is fully aware 
of 
the country's needs. Because it lacks the resources to build 
these large-scale works on its own, it can facilitate things so 
they are built through concessions. For example, I have 
information the national railroad plan, which has an 
extraordinary outlook for the country's economic and social 
sectors, has received offers from qualified enterprises in the 
country and abroad to build different portions of the railroad 
in various regions of the country; in other words, they consider 
this as a very good opportunity to invest and make a good deal, 
not to mention the fact this would give the country what it has 
needed for more than 100 years--a railroad network. 
  [Fernandez] That is a good example of how the Concessions 
Law 
can be fully implemented. You talked about the need for harmony, 
the need to maintain firm, coherent criteria concerning the 
government's economic strategy to prevent contradictions in the 
future. This happened to Carlos Perez's government, whose 
ministerial team worked on its own and provoked contradictions 
with AD's sensibility and perception. I do not think the same 
thing will happen with the Caldera administration. There is a 
consensus within the National Convergence on its democratic 
actions, and the same goes for MAS [Movement Toward Socialism]; 
nevertheless, what is your opinion on a possible negotiation 
with Congress? 
  [Paris] Those negotiations would be difficult no matter how 
much goodwill to fully cooperate there is at Congress, as I 
believe there is. Negotiations would not be easy because 
political issues will, naturally, play a decisive role, and this 
somehow exerts an influence on any decision that may be adopted. 
  Pertaining to the AD, we have decided to follow a strategy 
which, although we will continue to oppose President Caldera's 
government, will allow the development of plans that benefit the 
country because we have always believed national interests are 
more important than the political interests of any party, 
institution, or group which would try to interfere in our 
economic and social development. We have said we are an 
opposition party, and we are proving that very objectively but 
very seriously. I believe Venezuela's situation is in no 
condition to be playing negative, petty politics that deny all 
the values.... 
  [Fernandez, interrupting] That is very important because one 
of the most fundamental issues now is the stabilization of the 
Venezuelan economy. By achieving good economic stability, we 
will obviously have political stability. 
  [Paris] Yes, if we do not resolve the country's economic 
situation, I believe the stability of the democratic system and 
the survival of democracy are in serious danger. 
  [Fernandez] AD is very clear on this issue and is willing to 
cooperate, of course, without losing its political or 
ideological principles or future electoral interests. 
  [Paris] Yes. I believe the party's leadership is aware of 
what we have on our hands. We know that if we do not act 
seriously and responsibly we run a very serious risk, including 
our party's survival, because the first decision a de facto 
government would make would be to disband all parties, as has 
always been the case. I do not believe there are any military 
coups that do not result in cruel dictatorships as has occurred 
in the past and worldwide. 
[Fernandez] Now that you are mentioning the electoral issue, 
elections were held recently in April. Elections were held in 
Lara State on 10 April, and there were also elections on 24 
April. The results were favorable for AD, thus ratifying 
confidence, either partial or whatever, in the party handling 
administrative chores. That did not occur in the mayoral race in 
San Cristobal, but that is another matter and another situation. 
How does your party feel about these victories? 
  [Paris] First, we regret we had to repeat an electoral 
process that AD had won in 1992. Due to things that occur in 
Venezuelan politics, the Supreme Court annulled the elections in 
Nueva Esparta and Lara and forced us to go through the process. 
We proved once again the AD is still a strong political force 
that will not disappear. No one can make it disappear because it 
is a result of a reality in this country. AD is a feeling that 
has been ingrained in the Venezuelan people for many years, 
since its founding. Be that as it may, despite so many attacks 
on AD and the errors AD has committed in various opportunities 
in the government, despite all these facts that might look 
negative, the result AD presents to the Venezuelan people is 
always positive. 
  [Fernandez] It is also important for an internal change to 
take place, not within the parameters of mere rhetoric, but, 
rather, a real change, because the victory in Lara, or Nueva 
Esparta, or any other victory merely as a result of a political 
situation does not mean AD is experiencing a new high or 
anything like that. 
  [Paris] We are definitely experiencing our best moment as a 
party, and we are suffering the results of so many things that 
have recently occurred and that in some way have undoubtedly 
affected AD's prestige and good image. We need to solve our 
problems. We have internal problems, and it would be silly to 
deny it, and these problems cannot be solved through shady deals 
or settlements. 
  I believe it is necessary to let the party rank and file 
state its views very clearly, very cleanly, without any 
interference, as to what it wants to do with AD, in what 
direction AD should go. I think it is advisable to carry out an 
ideological renewal, a revision of what we have done for the 
country, what we have done wrong and what we have done right, to 
gain the necessary experience that will allow us to redefine the 
party's future actions, as I believe we are going to, because 
internal elections should be held this year. 
  [Fernandez] Precisely. There are questions from our 
television viewers in Caricuao and Tucupido, Guarico State, who 
called our telephone numbers 793-1845 and 793-1634 to comment on 
this issue; that is, internal elections. 
  [Paris] I do not believe anyone in the party would dare 
propose at this time that we postpone the elections forever. 
They must be held this year because this term of the board of 
directors ends in November. The party's secretary general, Mr. 
Luis Alfaro, has said he wants to feel the satisfaction of 
having the party renew itself, change its board of directors for 
the first time when the board's term is up. Hopefully this will 
be carried out in.... 
  [Fernandez, interrupting] Claudio Fermin has already 
announced his plans. 
  [Paris] Claudio Fermin has already announced his plans, 
rightfully so, and other candidates may possibly arise. Other 
candidates may convince the rank and file of the need to change 
the party so it may truly become an instrument of change. 
  I think we have to organize the party's activities at the 
municipal level because it is from there, from the rank and 
file, from the local committees, from the Venezuelan 
neighborhoods and rural homes, where a movement for AD's renewal 
and change can arise. I sincerely believe in this and hope we do 
it this year to the satisfaction of the many party activists who 
are demanding it and who will not allow any further postponement 
of this issue.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 3 
May. 
  Finexpo (Venezuelan Fund for Export Financing) has reported 
the credits it has granted, through financial institutions in 
the importing countries, have had a substantial increase in the 
first three months of the year. It financed 113 export 
operations between January and March 1994, versus 75 in the same 
period last year. The amount of credits also increased by more 
than $11 million from January to March 1993 to almost $22 
million during the same period of 1994. The lines of credit have 
been used primarily by financial institutions in Ecuador (9), 
Colombia (22), Peru (7), Chile (4), Bolivia (2), Argentina (2), 
Mexico (3), and Paraguay (2). Finexpo Vice President Policarpo 
Rodriguez has asserted he is still waiting for the Venezuelan 
Investment Fund to approve a new line of credit for $90 million, 
$80 million to be allotted to mid- and long-term operations and 
$10 million to the Fund for the Special Political Risk 
Insurance. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in Spanish 29 Apr 94 
p 20) 
  Norys Aguirre, the newly appointed president of the Deposit 
Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund (Fogade) has met with 
economic media representatives for the first time today and told 
them the public credit law will be the legal instrument to 
obtain the necessary economic resources to recapitalize the 
private banks subsidized by Fogade. (Caracas Radio Nacional de 
Venezuela Canal Clasico Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 28 Apr 94)

<F P=106> [Closing address by President Fidel Castro at the special </F>
session of the National Assembly of the People's Government, 
ANPP, at the Havana Convention Center on 2 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] I am going to speak very briefly. Yesterday, I 
expressed some essential ideas on this issue. Today, we heard a 
brilliant exposition by Comrade Alarcon that should be 
considered a summary of what we have discussed here. I believe 
that now the most difficult part begins: the implementation of 
the recommendations and duties the National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP] has entrusted to the government. 
  I believe that what was agreed to here is coherent and it 
provides a broad, extremely broad, framework in which to make 
the most appropriate decisions. Logically, the most difficult 
part is the implementation. As I mentioned yesterday, all this 
requires a plan and time. Time does not mean that this will be 
left up to the Greek calendar, but a minimal time. Some of the 
practical applications of the measures discussed are 
complicated. Almost every organization involved in the 
implementation of these measures needs time. Even the comrades 
from the electric service, once it is decided whether to 
implement the principle of increasing electric rates, will need 
some time to implement them. 
  Anything having to do with the change of currency is a 
complex issue. This requires a lot of imagination, original 
thinking in order to implement any measures of this kind in the 
most frugal way possible. 
  This accord has the advantage of flexibility and a broad 
scope to allow the government to analyze and consult in order to 
take these measures -- not only the measures recommended here 
but also those whose adoption might be considered appropriate 
within these principles. We have to analyze well which measures 
from the relatively long list divulged by Comrade [Finance 
Minister] Jose Luis Rodriguez are truly appropriate . 
  I must repeat what I said yesterday: We have to act so we do 
not stop halfway down the road. We have to act decisively. We 
have to act so the problem is solved. The worst thing would be 
to leave things half solved. We must solve it completely, not 
only to guarantee recovery from the excess currency, but also to 
ensure progressive improvement in the situation until a time 
when we can say: This is it, the moment when we can be sure the 
problem is not going to replicate. It would serve nothing to 
have to meet here again, in one or two years, to say that we 
have a similar situation. 
  We have to figure out how to avoid that. Therefore, the 
measures taken ought to guarantee it. This is of the utmost 
importance. It is decisive. We must act serenely, thoughtfully, 
speedily; assume responsibility; be courageous; work, explain, 
and divulge. 
  I believe everything discussed here, without exception, 
ought 
to be divulged through radio, newspapers, and television in 
order to attain the people's understanding, or the greater 
possible understanding, of what has been said here by several 
comrades, and to continue explaining. The media have to help in 
explaining the importance of taking all these measures. The 
population has to understand. I am convinced the people are 
going to understand. 
  I believe the fact that many aspects of Cuba's history are 
well-known, or supposedly well-known, is no reason not to 
disseminate as widely as possible Comrade Alarcon's words before 
the recess. What he said, with great accuracy and clarity, is 
part of the ideological struggle we are waging. They want to 
bring capitalist prescriptions to Cuba. There are no such 
prescriptions: Even the developed capitalist countries have many 
problems they have not solved. What is reported in that magazine 
from Florida is evidence of that. Similar things can be said of 
the wealthiest capitalists countries. Their unemployment 
problems are appalling. They have a special situation where the 
economy is growing and the number of jobs, dropping. They cannot 
boast of being models to the world when that is the model they 
parade before the world. 
  We have the great merit of resisting and have time in our 
favor. We also know what is happening in the rest of the world, 
particularly in the Third World, and the dire crises into which 
neoliberal theories are dragging those countries. We do not have 
a smidgen of neoliberalism or capitalism. We are truly facing a 
world completely ruled by neoliberalism and capitalism. This 
does not mean that we are going to surrender. This means that we 
have to adapt many things to the reality of that world. That we 
are doing, but with much equanimity, without relinquishing our 
ideals, our goals. 
  I ask that you have complete trust in what the party and 
government do. They are defending, to the last atom, socialist 
ideas, principles, and goals. Even if we have to it under 
conditions as difficult as these. 
  I want to tell you that the world is in the hands of the 
multinational corporations; the world is entirely in the hands 
of capitalism, and it will last a relatively long time; and a 
revolution as pure as ours, as firm and committed as ours, is 
forced to take those realities and factors into account. 
  At times, I have talked about the fuel situation, where for 
us to be able to explore for fuel, to be able to use it -- if we 
find it -- we need to make agreements with multinational 
corporations, and we have to adjust ourselves to the interests 
of those enterprises, combining them with our own interests. But 
these are things that we would not have done if we had had the 
capital and technology to exploit those resources. 
  In other words, even though we have had to make concessions, 
we make the conditions... [pauses] the concessions that are 
unavoidable in order to survive and to be able to develop 
ourselves. Because we are not only talking about living in a 
world dominated and hegemonigized by capitalism and imperialism; 
we are talking about a world in which our country is blockaded 
by the world's most powerful economic, political, and military 
power. It carries out any action it wishes to block our economic 
work. 
  Despite this, I must also add, the number of foreign 
companies interested in dealing with Cuba increases. These firms 
are interested in Cuba's security and stability. I should also 
mention that we occupy one of the [pauses] an important place on 
the list of countries considered safe for foreign investments. 
The number of firms, I repeat, interested in dealing with Cuba 
is growing, despite enormous pressure by the United States. 
  Comrades, I must also say that our problems are not limited 
only to internal finances, excess currency, and the problems 
that this brings to our daily work. We must constantly face a 
great scarcity of resources, the problem involving the purchase 
of food for the population, the problem involving the purchase 
of medicine for the population, the purchase of fuel for our 
economy, the purchase of spare parts and all types of materials, 
so that our economy can remain in operation and so our plans can 
advance. 
  A comrade spoke of the very real situation we have, even 
with 
agricultural tools like plows. He was right when he said our 
industry can make plows. That is true. But each one of those 
plows requires a certain amount of steel of very different types 
that must be purchased for hard currency on the world market. We 
have been working without fertilizers. Many times we have been 
working without pesticides. Guaranteeing the fuel needed each 
day for transportation and agriculture is an agony. 
  With this I want to say to you that we are working under 
very 
difficult conditions. But we are not discouraged. We continue to 
struggle, invent, and work. We look for solutions. I can assure 
you that our country is facing these difficulties, which are not 
discussed every day, in an exemplary manner. 
  We could also say that many times our cane cutters have had 
to work barefooted. Many workers have had to carry out their 
tasks without proper clothing. The food that is given to the 
workers does not always supply the nutrition they need for the 
tasks they perform, despite the effort being made to increase 
food production and self-sufficiency. We cannot, for a single 
minute, forget the extraordinarily difficult conditions under 
which we are working. 
  I believe there was a reason that Alarcon mentioned 
Guaymaro. 
This is not only Guaymaro; this is the 10-year war in which we 
are trying, despite the many shortages and difficulties, to keep 
the population from being in need; to see that the population 
never lacks even recreation, when it is possible; that children 
and their mothers never lack essentials. 
  I believe our people are truly writing a page in history. I 
believe that what we have agreed to here is an example of 
courage, of awareness, of how we, without ignoring all the other 
things, dedicate ourselves to solving these problems because 
solving them helps us continue our struggle. We must keep all 
these things in mind. The enemy tries to plant discouragement 
and tries to dishearten our people. We must wage a parallel 
struggle to encourage, to strengthen them morally, to lift their 
spirit of combat. 
  Just look at the news we hear from all around the world on 
the magnitude of the ceremonies marking 1 May. There are places 
where, I was told, more than 100,000 people gathered to 
celebrate this day. We considered it an appropriate arrangement, 
instead of making the great mobilization of all these years and 
continuing the style of the 26 July festivities, to meet here 
and discuss these problems with which we are giving tribute to 
the working class because this is the Revolution of the working 
class. 
  We have met here precisely to adopt all those measures that 
will help save the Revolution of the working class. This does 
not mean that we will never again meet at the Plaza of the 
Revolution to participate in parades. As soon as circumstances 
allow, we will parade with even greater enthusiasm than ever. 
  I believe today we are doing the things that we should do 
and 
that we are doing them in the way that we should. The comrades 
of the government will not rest a single minute in drafting and 
implementing all the measures. They will not be able to do all 
of them at the same time, I repeat once again. It will have to 
be one measure today, another tomorrow, and then another, etc. 
We must follow the order of the simplest, then the more complex. 
  And the first one is going to come out, I believe, this very 
week. It is a Council of State decree-law regarding the 
confiscation of ill-gotten wealth. [applause]. 
  That decree-law has already been drafted and is being 
distributed to the members of the Council of State. It is that 
simple. It is seen as an expeditious method, without many 
complicated formalities. Now, I do not know where these money 
hoarders are going to put what they have because I do not think 
they will be able to get away so easily; they who have so 
notably and scandalously become rich from the people's sacrifice. 
  This reminds us of the first years of the Revolution, when a 
law was established to confiscate the ill-gotten goods of those 
who had grown rich during the tyranny. Later, each of the prices 
will have to be analyzed; they will be applied as soon as 
possible because calculations must be based on availability and 
different formulas. 
  There will always be doubts, one way or another, as to 
whether it would have been better to do it this way or some 
other. Because we must also act with a political criterion. We 
must also be tactful. Some things are not so difficult [pauses] 
so easy to apply. 
  When cigarette prices are changed, because we must change 
them...[pauses] Cigarettes can be one of the main sources for 
collecting money. We must consider how many we have; how many 
are in production; what do we will do about people with the 
standing quota, who are probably the older ones -- I believe 
they are 38 and older; and what we will do about those who have 
the new quota. 
  The treatment is not the same today, and it can it be the 
same. We must take into account what we will do with the amount 
that remains available. We must consider whether all the 
consequences would be greater or fewer if we liberate that 
product. We must look at it from the political standpoint. We 
must figure out the numbers. The collection will not always be 
exact. It could happen that, at a set price, those figures are 
not met because there was not enough money to purchase them 
among those interested in buying them. 
  That is why some of these decisions about what to do are 
unquestionably more complicated and there will always be 
opinions: some who will say it was better to do it this way, and 
others who will say it was better to do it another way. 
  It would be nice if a set price were later to be reduced. 
But 
all these phenomena must be studied because one must also 
consider the political sense of each of the things done. We must 
also consider salaries, incomes, and the salaries of retired 
workers, which usually is not too much. All these factors must 
be considered when a decision is going to be made on setting a 
price. 
  There are some areas where there is no alternative. For 
electricity, there is no alternative. Because consumption has 
increased tremendously. In Havana City it has increased 24 
percent. Comrade Marcos Portal explained this very well in great 
detail during his television interview. Many people have had to 
use electric stoves because we have lacked other types of fuel. 
Efforts are being made to find ways to redistribute the 
resources in such a way that they can use other fuels that would 
make that enormous use of electricity unnecessary. 
  A quota was established for the use of electricity. It was 
met, basically; but a moment came when it was no longer 
possible. Portal explained the problems we had with plants and 
maintenance. A special effort has been made and continues to be 
made and will continue to be made to increase production, 
improve maintenance, increase capacities in a way 
that...[pauses] But there is no way to satisfy a demand that 
increases 24 percent. I believe we can improve in some aspects. 
  We have gone through tremendous times of outages. Even 
broadcasts have been affected. One cannot be sure whether people 
are hearing them. They have to be repeated. If you want 
something to be heard, you have to broadcast it on Monday, and 
then maybe on Wednesday, and then maybe even on Sunday. Our most 
important sources of information are television and radio. But 
when there are outages, two or three times a week and sometimes 
even more, one cannot watch television. Often the radio cannot 
be used because there are no batteries. The newspapers are not 
enough. Communication today is a problem under the current 
conditions. 
  But I can assure you that no one rests a single moment in 
the 
search for solutions, economic solutions, in increasing exports 
and in the development of all the high priority areas despite 
the difficult conditions and the blockade. We are very aware of 
how difficult these times are. 
  These measures that we studied are precisely to help 
overcome 
these difficult times. That is what we should be doing. I am 
sure that is the way that the people of Guaymaro acted. Those 
who we know were not there did not hesitate to become combatants 
of the 10-Year War. If I am going to compare our current stage 
with anything, I will compare it with the 10-Year War. When I 
see all that the people...[pauses] Many of these people even had 
to fight barefoot, with scarcely any clothing. This does not 
mean that we expect people to cut cane barefoot or without 
clothes. We must do whatever is possible to [word indistinct] 
those resources among the workers. 
  We could even say that during that war Cubans fought without 
weapons. I am sure that those who have a great appreciation for 
the great merits of the people and the great value of history 
will agree with me when I can say that this struggle does not 
remind us of the Sierra Maestra or the Granma expedition; this 
struggle reminds us of the 10-Year War. It may be that, in the 
future, historians will find this epic as great as that one, 
because today we are confronting the hegemony of imperialism on 
the world level and the hegemony of capitalism on the world 
level. And under those difficult conditions we fight, defending 
our ideals, our cause, and our dreams. 
  We have demonstrated what many thought impossible. After the 
collapse of the socialist block and the Soviet Union, almost 
four years later, Cuba remains. The country they once called a 
satellite has today become a star of heroism, courage, 
independence, and light, capable of making history. When history 
is written, many will admire how this small country, here in the 
Caribbean, only 90 miles from the United States and with a naval 
base on its territory, had the courage, the integrity, and the 
spirit to wave the banners of independence and the Revolution. 
  After all these years of experience, we have the conviction 
that those banners will continue to wave and will be carried to 
victory. In conclusion, that is the reason I can say that some 
day, Alarcon, future generations will talk about this assembly 
as you spoke of Guaymaro and they will talk about our people as 
we have spoken here of the historic Mambis of the War of 1968. 
Thank you very much. [applause]

  [Text] San Pedro Sula -- Strong slogans against the Liberal 
government, critical of its maladministration, were chanted 
during the worker-peasant International Labor Day parade in this 
city. Throughout the 15 blocks covered by the parade and at the 
rally held at Francisco Morazan Civic Plaza next to the local 
stadium, workers and peasants directed their attacks against 
Carlos Roberto Reina's government, which they compared to that 
of Rafael Leonardo Callejas, for its actions that have 
impoverished the working class. 
  Slogans such as this were chanted during the parade: "Red 
Rooster [logo of the Liberal Party] you have shit on the 
people," "Blues and Reds, you have shit on the people," "There 
is no peace; beans cost more," "What good is the moral 
revolution if we are still on a pile of shit," "We are 
civilists, not militarists," "The Armed Forces are the people's 
armed branch, and the people are in power, ha ha ha," "The 
damned revolution brought us devaluation," "We must sell the 
F-5's so we can eat." 
  Before the 1 May rally began, demonstrators burned two 
coffins, one symbolizing mandatory military service, the other, 
the U.S. Government. They also burned effigies of the current 
president and the traditional party. 
  Contrary to other opinions, the worker and peasant leaders 
who led the parade, including Mario Quintanilla, Mauro Gonzalez, 
Victor Artiles, Efrain Aguilar, and Israel Salinas, said the 
goal of gathering 60,000 people was achieved. Although the 
number was not confirmed, the truth is the march covered ten 
blocks, causing the coordinators to be satisfied. 
  In their proposals, the workers described Carlos Roberto 
Reina's Liberal government as weak and devoid of a political 
definition as it approaches its first 100 days in power. The 
workers said the regime of the moral revolution must establish 
social justice for all Hondurans, which makes miserable the sad 
life of the majority of fellow citizens. [sentence as published] 
  Therefore, the workers, peasants, and professional 
associations demand the current government implement an 
emergency food and agrarian reform plan that will guarantee 
access to land for peasants, timely credit at low rates, and 
technical and state assistance to allow them to commercialize 
production. They also demanded the immediate suspension of the 
existence of the "ill-called Law of Agricultural Modernization," 
while a new agrarian reform law, which is consistent with the 
peasants' real situation and needs, is drafted. 
  They called for a general wage readjustment for all Honduran 
workers because current wages do not satisfy the basic needs of 
nourishment, health, education, housing, and recreation, in view 
of the monetary devaluation and inflation caused by the former 
government. 
  Concerning the health field, they said social security is a 
right of the people. They demanded, therefore, the government 
establish legal and financial mechanisms to expand the coverage 
and quality of the Honduran social security service. They asked 
for hospitals supplied with surgical equipment and the 
establishment of public health clinics. 
  On public housing, it was regarded as a natural right of 
human beings, not as merchandise for profit. They demanded an 
immediate revision of the social housing fund law. 
  The workers demanded President Reina establish a labor 
policy 
that would guarantee the freedom and autonomy of social 
organizations, labor unions, peasant, professional, indian, 
environmental, and youth organizations. They also demanded 
urgent approval of labor code reform, restructuring the Labor 
Ministry, and the teachers statute. 
  Concerning privatizations, they said the Honduran state must 
reserve for itself the direction and administration of strategic 
utilities such as water, electricity, and telephone service, 
provided it is for the betterment of its quality. 
  They demanded Congress urgently issue a decree on voluntary 
military service, social, educational, humanist, and democratic, 
with the respective rules in accordance with the law. 
  They demanded the electoral processes be totally trustworthy 
and called for institutions to divest themselves of sectarian 
political interests, which have made electoral functions corrupt. 
  On the crisis through which Hondurans live, the workers 
called for a real and effective process of social concord to 
unite the interests of all Hondurans, in search of a better 
future that will not benefit the powerful minority. 
  Regarding ecological and environmental aspects, the Honduran 
workers pronounced themselves against the installation of a 
refinery in Trujillo and the felling of trees. They demanded 
the government declare a one-year moratorium on lumber 
exportations. 
  For the organized classes that marched, grouped in the 
Regional Northwestern Coordinating Board of Peoples 
Organizations [consisting of the United Federation of Honduran 
Workers, the Confederation of Honduran Workers, and the 
Coordinating Council of Honduran Peasant Organizations] 
yesterday was a memorable date because in 1954, 40 years ago, 
the first banana workers strike in El Progreso gave birth to the 
Honduran worker movement.

  [Text] In a message to the public exactly one week prior to 
the elections, President Guillermo Endara asked the Panamanian 
people to remember the past and establish the difference between 
this democratic electoral campaign and past campaigns. "The 
Panamanian people must remember this campaign has been totally 
different from past campaigns; it is up to the people to ensure 
the example of this election will be repeated in every future 
election," Endara told LA PRENSA. 
  The president suggested that under no circumstances should 
the Panamanian people allow anyone to deprive them of the right 
to vote freely as citizens of a democratic government. Endara 
said he is pleased to preside over the first popular election in 
freedom and democracy. 
  Endara took office on 20 December 1989, when U.S. troops 
invaded the country and toppled the military regime of Manuel 
Antonio Noriega, who is serving a 40-year prison sentence in the 
United States on drug-trafficking charges. 
  "I cannot decide Panama's future. That is exclusively up to 
the Panamanian people, and I am therefore asking them to go to 
the polls and vote for the best candidate," the president said. 
  Endara reiterated he is pleased with his accomplishments as 
president and will surrender power to whomever wins the 8 May 
elections. "It will be my duty to surrender power on 1 
September to whomever wins the elections. Moreover, for the 
first time, immediately after the winner is named, I will offer 
him my support and an orderly transition period so that when he 
takes office he will be aware of all public affairs," the 
president added. 
  Approximately 1.5 million Panamanians will elect the new 
government that will replace Endara's on 8 May.

  [Text] Brasilia, 2 May (EFE) -- Brazilian presidential 
candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva today urged U.S. President 
Bill Clinton to invite his Cuban counterpart, Fidel Castro, to 
attend the "summit" of the Americas to be held in Miami on 9-10 
December. 
  Lula is the leading presidential candidate for the 3 October 
elections. He said Latin American governments should not 
consider Cuba's exclusion from the meeting "as a fait accompli." 
  Lula said the Brazilian Government should recommend that 
Clinton pick a city other than Miami to hold the "summit" and 
that Castro be invited to attend. 
  In remarks to EFE, the 48-year-old leader of the Workers 
Party (PT, socialist) charged that choosing Miami to host the 
meeting is "an act of provocation for Cubans." 
  Brazilian President Itamar Franco has announced that he 
would 
invite the winner of the 3 October presidential election to join 
his entourage to the "summit" of the Americas. 
  Lula said that, even though he has received no invitation, 
he 
would not attend the summit because one Latin American country, 
Cuba, will not be represented there. 
  Lula has voiced his opposition to the trade embargo that for 
three decades has been imposed by the United States on Cuba. 
  On previous occasions, Lula said that he is in favor of 
Castro's calling democratic elections in Cuba.

  [Text] Washington, 3 May (EFE) -- Chile will begin late 
this month preliminary negotiations for a possible bilateral 
trade agreement with the United States or for joining NAFTA, 
which is made up of the United States, Mexico, and Canada. 
  Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat announced today in 
Washington 
the beginning of the formal negotiations after meeting for one 
hour with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor. 
  After meeting with Kantor and other high U.S. officials, 
Aninat said: "We are very satisfied with the environment we 
found, because Chile will be the first country to negotiate an 
agreement with the United States." 
  Aninat disclosed that the official negotiations may begin in 
the middle of this year. 
  Aninat confirmed the will of the Bill Clinton administration 
to make Chile the first Latin American country to negotiate a 
bilateral trade agreement or even to join NAFTA. 
  Aninat reported that the purpose of the preliminary 
meetings, 
which will begin late in May among experts and will continue 
over the next few months, is to study trade issues, the 
treatment of investment protection, and foreign investment 
regulations both in Chile and in the United States. 
  Aninat also added that other technical meetings will be held 
in the next few months in Santiago and in Washington to study 
other issues, such as the protection of the environment, and to 
compare labor legislation. 
  Aninat said that on these issues Chile has no problems, 
because it already has legislation in force that is comparable 
to U.S. legislation. 
  Before the beginning of the formal meetings, which will 
probably begin in mid-September, Chile and the United States 
would like "to shorten the path" that may lead to an agreement 
to be signed in January 1995 "at the latest."

  [Text] Upon learning through CLARIN of [U.S. Trade 
Representative] Mickey Kantor's latest remarks, Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo sought a favorable aspect from the threat. 
Cavallo said: "U.S. Ambassador James Cheek told President Menem 
that President Clinton has decided not to include Argentina for 
the next 60 days on the list of countries that are likely be 
punished. Kantor informed me over the telephone of this 
decision." 
  Cavallo noted: "The news is not that we will be punished; 
the 
news is that any possible punishments will not begin on 30 
April, the move has been moved back by at least 60 days. This 
represents a positive, not a negative gesture towards Argentina." 
  Concerning the harsh description of "greatest trade 
pirates," 
the minister noted: "Countries that do not protect intellectual 
property are involved in a type of piracy. We must not be 
offended by these words."

  [Text] Lima, 2 May (EFE) -- Peruvian Justice Minister 
Fernando Vega announced today that he will not meet with the 
members of the Human Rights Commission of the New York Bar 
Association who are visiting Lima because, he said, "I don't 
discuss anything about Peruvian sovereignty or jurisdiction with 
foreigners." 
  A group of U.S. lawyers headed by New York Federal District 
Judge Jack B. Weinstein arrived in Peru to study the Peruvian 
judicial and penal system, especially aspects related to 
antiterrorist legislation. 
  Vega said he had received no request for a meeting from the 
U.S. lawyers, but had he done so he would "never" meet with them. 
  Vega told the media he knew the visitors had come to see 
Peruvian prisons, and in this regard he added, "I will send them 
pictures of the prisons." 
  The Human Rights Commission of the New York Bar Association 
will meet with Jorge Avendano, dean of the Lima Lawyers 
Association, with representatives of the Pro-Human Rights 
Association, and with the Human Rights Commission of Congress. 
  Avendano said the U.S. lawyers had contacted him, and they 
would meet in the Lima Lawyers Association headquarters on 5 May. 
  Avendano indicated that the visitors want to study the real 
situation of the Peruvian criminal justice system. 
  A few months ago, after paying a visit to the country, a 
delegation of jurists headed by U.S. lawyer Robert Goldman 
criticized Peruvian criminal legislation in a report that was 
rejected by government officials.

<F P=106> [Report by Monica Vecco] </F>
  [Excerpts] During a visit to the basin of the Pichis and 
Palcazu Rivers, LA REPUBLICA established that several groups of 
drug traffickers from San Martin and Ucayali, who managed to 
dodge repression by the security forces, now operate in the 
mountainous Pasco region. 
  Laboratories for the production of cocaine base paste, large 
quantities of precursors, groups of Colombian henchmen, and 
airstrips for the clandestine shipment of drugs dominate the 
region where three successive governments have unsuccessfully 
tried to execute a regional development program. 
  Dozens of Peruvian and Colombian "firms," most of them from 
Uchiza, operate in the Pichis-Palcazu region. The region is 
shared by the Colombian "Palenque," "Crespo," and "Palito" 
firms, and Peruvian traffickers Reynaldo Quiroz Ruiz, aka 
"Pacho," Luis Lopez Aguilar, aka "Somoza," "Cabezon," "Tio 
Rios," "Raymond," "Los Ayacuchanos," "Rene," and "Lucho Pelado." 
  "Lucho Pelado" comes from Tocache and heads a "firm" that 
purchases large quantities of cocaine paste. This firm operated 
in Uchiza, Aguaytia, and Zungaro, where it handled about 500 kg 
per month of washed cocaine paste. 
  Colombian drug trafficker "Crespo," who previously operated 
in Campanilla and Saposoa, is one of the largest buyers in the 
zone. He moves approximately one tonne of washed cocaine paste 
per month. 
  "Somoza," who operated in Sion and Juanjui, is one of the 
few 
to have a cocaine hydrochloride laboratory in San Juan town, two 
and one half hours up the Pichis River. 
  But the most powerful firm belongs to the much-feared 
Colombian trafficker "Palenque," who is responsible for an 
average of three 600-kg drug flights per week, that is, 
approximately two tonnes per week. 
  Three new "firms" started in the region about two weeks ago. 
Among them is "La Coneja," which used to supply precursors to 
the Cachique Rivera brothers in Aguaytia. The firm allegedly 
represents the Cachique Rivera brothers. 
  On 26 March, "Palenque," who is one of the cruelest 
traffickers, sent his henchmen to set fire to "La Coneja's" 
laboratory on the Palcazu River bank. About 15 neighboring 
houses also caught fire and were reduced to cinders. "La 
Coneja," who drives a late-model white Tercel along the dusty 
roads of Palcazu town, has been warned to leave. 
  Previously, "Palenque" opposed the entry of the Cachique 
Rivera brothers, who moved with their army of henchmen to 
Iscozacin, from where they currently make their shipments to 
Colombia. 
  The "colochos" (Colombians) hold the monopoly of the cocaine 
hydrochloride production and zealously defend it from any 
Peruvian "firms" that want to supply the Cali Cartel. The 
Cachique Rivera brothers are the only ones who have the mafia's 
authorization to produce cocaine hydrochloride. 
  In June and November 1993, joint DEA [Drug Enforcement 
Administration] and Navy forces used five gunships during 
operations in Palcazu and Puerto Victoria. On both occasions, 
the traffickers were warned and managed "to flee" in time. 
  LA REPUBLICA learned that some "firms" took refuge in Puerto 
Bermudez, where the Army's OR 34-A Oxapampa battalion is 
stationed. Some battalion officers reportedly receive 
"protection fees" to turn a blind eye to the traffickers' 
activities. 
  It is said that while Captain Marcos Rios Ruiz was commander 
of this Army base, between April and August 1993, drug planes 
were seen operating from the Puerto Bermudez commercial airport. 
A merchant who chose not to identify himself said: "Everyone 
knew this was going on but could say nothing out of fear." 
Civilians charged that the Army captain received "protection 
fees" to allow traffickers to operate. 
  Puerto Bermudez Mayor Evaristo Zumaran Cayata was also 
charged with cooperating with the "firms." The "Juana Corina" 
Mothers Club in Puerto Bermudez accused the mayor of "pocketing" 
$4,000 for every flight he authorized. 
  During a heated meeting on 2 January 1993, the mothers asked 
Zumaran Cayata "to say what happened to the money he received 
for signing permits. It was to have been used for local 
projects." Neither the mayor nor Judge Jorge Camacho, who was 
his aide and was also accused of corruption on the same 
occasion, answered. 
  Machinery belonging to Puerto Bermudez City Hall was used to 
improve the Gavilan airstrip that was administered by "Somoza" 
and hired to other "firms." Army Captain Carlos "Alex" Alzamora 
replaced Rios Ruiz. According to civilian sources, he allowed 
traffickers to set up a clandestine airstrip along a portion of 
the Marginal highway near the town of Gavilan, 7 km from Puerto 
Bermudez. 
  Some honest people of the region have stated that before 
Alzamora was replaced by Captain "Coyote" [not further 
identified] in December 1993, the number of "firms" increased, 
converting the peaceful town of Puerto Bermudez into a shelter 
for traffickers. 
  Last 24 March, a high-ranking officer from the Army 
Inspector's department arrived in a MI-17 helicopter to inspect 
the military units in Oxapampa. Just three days before, the 
newly appointed commander of Puerto Bermudez battalion, Captain 
"James" Becerra Luna, gave orders for the Gavilan clandestine 
airstrip to be mined and surrounded by barbed wire to prevent 
traffickers from using it. They only left one four-meter wide 
lane open for the circulation of traffic. Less than 150 meters 
away on the Marginal highway is a checkpoint where the Army 
permanently checks the circulation of vehicles and passengers 
from La Merced to the Pichis-Palcazu valley. 
  A month earlier, the FAP [Peruvian Air Force] placed 
concrete 
and steel blocs that were ripped out and only replaced after 
drug planes had been allowed to land. One woodcutter of the 
zone said: "The soldiers blocked the way when an aircraft was 
about to land." As soon as one landing strip is destroyed, the 
traffickers build another. 
  Some 3 km from Gavilan is the Cajonari airstrip and two 
hours 
up the Pichis River, the "Pacho" firm has a 900-meter strip in 
San Jose de Azupizu, from where an average of three aircraft a 
week take off. There are more strips along the Pichis River in 
San Juan (where "Somoza" firm has a cocaine hydrochloride 
laboratory), San Pedro, San Pablo, and Santa Isabel towns. The 
Cajonari and Lorenzillo Uno airstrips are located in the 60 km 
that separates Puerto Bermudez from Palcazu. 
  In the towns of Raya, Esperanza, Quirishiari (an indigenous 
Ashaninka Indian settlement), Siria, Lorenzo, Lorenzillo Uno, 
and Lorenzillo Dos, which are between Puerto Bermudez and 
Palcazu, there are large coca leaf plantations and laboratories 
where "Pepe," a chemist from Pucallpa, turns coca leaves into 
cocaine base. 
  There are airstrips in Puerto Victoria and Isla Codo, the 
latter is just one hour from Ciudad Constitucion, on the Pichis 
River. The Cachique Rivera brothers allegedly have a cocaine 
hydrochloride laboratory in Ciudad Constitucion. 
  In the town of Santa Rosa de Chivis, one hour from Gavilan 
by 
the Marginal highway, the traffickers have another airstrip. To 
build this airstrip, last September, the traffickers seized 
machinery belonging to the Pichis-Palcazu project and abducted 
one of the operators who was found only after two days of an 
exhaustive search. 
  Palcazu, 150 km from La Merced town along the Marginal 
highway, is the main drug center for the valley, which has many 
laboratories where merchants deliver the unrefined or processed 
drugs. Local inhabitants say it "is the center" where the main 
firms as well as henchmen, prostitutes, and terrorists gather 
after fleeing from Huallaga. 
  Palcazu bridge is one of the favorite places to close deals. 
This is where the merchants, who ride motorcycles or brand new 
pickups, bring their knapsacks containing their work tools 
(spoons and candles) to test how pure the drug is. In Puerto 
Bermudez, the drug is more pure, therefore, it costs more. 
Merchants pay up to $720 per kg of "base," while in Palcazu the 
price is $650. In Zungaro, Aguaytia, and Pucallpa "base" costs 
$520 per kg. 
  Approximately 7.5 kg of cocaine "paste" is obtained from 100 
square meters of coca plantation. About three kg of "base" or 
"washed paste" is obtained from 7.5 kg of cocaine "paste." About 
one kg of cocaine hydrochloride is obtained from one kg of 
cocaine "base." 
  The arrival of thousands of people and the circulation of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in the Pichis-Palcazu Valley 
seems to have brought the prosperity settlers expected from 
ambitious development projects. Prosperity is apparent. 
  Towns may lack water, electricity, airfields, sewerage 
systems, and telephones but just as in the Huallaga valley, 
trafficking has attracted many prostitutes, common criminals, 
and subversives who "escaped" from Huallaga. 
  The latest population and housing census shows that the 
population of Palcazu increased from 16,000 to almost 20,000 
people following the coca migration. [passage omitted] 
  But the most serious concern for farmers in the zone is that 
the wide area opened by traffickers in Pichis-Palcazu threatens 
the native forest of the high jungle region. Hundreds of 
thousands of hectares, where not even a single coca plant was 
grown, are now being destroyed. The rivers are beginning to show 
the first signs of contamination due to the indiscriminate 
dumping of chemicals used for making drugs.

currency. This is in concurrence with a document issued by the 
Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Venezuela on the need 
to maintain monetary stability. The exchange rate, however, 
closed yesterday at a purchase rate of 128.20 bolivares to the 
dollar and a selling rate of 129.50. 
  The bank's communique also lists the main points of the 
economic plan, as presented by the executive branch, under 
President Rafael Caldera's solidarity promise. The plan is based 
on five basic premises which are: The development and 
consolidation of macroeconomic management; the general 
dissemination of tax reforms, which is intended to gain 
permanent balance for the government's finances; national and 
foreign investment incentives; and consolidation of trade 
opening by way of integration agreements, among others. Based on 
the above, Grisanti says there is no reason for any speculation 
in the currency exchange rate. Here are a few of his statements: 
  [Begin Grisanti recording] For these reasons there is no 
justification for an increase in currency speculation which 
would be harmful to our national currency. The population can 
rest assured that the executive branch has taken, and will 
continue to take, necessary steps to maintain the economic 
balance and that the exchange rate will stabilize. [end

  [Text] On 4 May, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina signed the ratification 
of a cultural agreement, dating from 1978, between Colombia and 
Cuba, at the Cuban Foreign Ministry. Sanin and Robaina also 
signed an agreement that standardizes higher education diplomas 
and titles. 
  Before signing these agreements, Sanin visited Casa de las 
Americas, where she donated typical Colombian items to the Latin 
American art exhibit. She also met with Marcia Leyseca, vice 
president of Casa de las Americas, Pablo Milanes, Sintio Vitier,

  [Text] On 4 May, the newspaper GRANMA published an 
editorial entitled, South Africa: Triumph Belongs to Those Who 
Struggle, on the ANC victory in the South African elections. 
GRANMA highlights Nelson Mandela's words during his visit to 
Cuba: We are determined to have the people of South Africa forge 
their own future. When that moment comes, it will not have been 
solely through our own efforts, but also thanks to the 
solidarity, support, and encouragement of the extraordinary 
people of Cuba. 
  The editorial goes on to point out that the Cuito Canavale 
victory overturned the balance of power in South Africa, which 
resulted in consolidation, through the ballot, of the efforts 
cemented for years with blood. The GRANMA editorial pays tribute 
to Mandela's wisdom, revolutionary determination, and strength, 
noting that he and his valiant people are today the fulfillment 
of hopes and dreams.

<F P=106> [By reporter Juan Carlos Roque Garcia in Mexico City] </F>
  [Text] Cuba will pay part of its debt to Mexico with 
assets. This is a financial arrangement that combines the 
payment of debts with investments through the direct injection 
of fresh money, better known as the swap [preceding word in 
English] sytem. 
  This system is being applied to three investment projects in 
priority sectors in Cuba: tourism, cement, and petroleum, as 
reported by the Mexican press. 
  Concerning tourism and cement, the contracts have already 
been signed and are already operating. Approximately $50 million 
of the Cuban debt to Mexico was paid through this contract. It 
has to do with the Tuzpan Hotel in Varadero, where 50 percent of 
the shares were purchased through this channel by the DSC group 
from Guadalajara. The other is the Mariel Cement Plant, the 
operator and trader of which is the Mexican cement company, 
Cemex. 
  The Petroleum agreement will be signed in May, and according 
to the magazine PROCESO, a letter of intent was already signed 
between Mexpetrol [Mexican Petroleum Company] -- the principal 
shareholder of which is the parastate company, Mexican Petroleum 
-- and (Cubec), the Cuban distributor of crude oil. 
  This represents a joint investment of $200 million, to 
modernize and expand the refinery in Cienfuegos, the largest in 
our country. Cuba owes $310 million to Mexico. Through this 
procedure, the Cuban Government will pay another $50 million and 
will guarantee investment. 
  Mexico is the first country with which agreements of this 
type have been signed, which, according to local analysts, 
accords Mexico the status of a nation favored by the Cuban 
Government.

  [Text] Within the next few weeks, the government will 
implement the accord by the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [ANPP], which entrusts the government with 
implementation measures aimed at correcting national financial 
imbalances. 
  Among the measures, there is the introduction of a general 
tax system; reducing subsidies covering losses by enterprises; 
and increasing the price of certain utilities such as 
electricity, telephone, and public food services. 
  In the accord, the ANPP also highlighted that the government 
should study the appropriateness of implementing a change in 
currency and increasing the price of nonessential products such 
as alcohol and cigarettes.

  [Excerpt] Meanwhile, another force to be reckoned with at 
the conference [global conference on Sustainable Development of 
Small Island Developing States] is the Nongovernmental 
Organizations, or NGO's. The [word indistinct] has announced 
resolutions on Cuba and Haiti as well as the formation of a new 
organization, integrating NGO's in small island states. Margaret 
Harris reports: 
  [Begin Harris recording] Some of the most relentless attacks 
on positions of modern states against crucial, regional small 
island developing states have been by NGO's. Early today, [words 
indistinct] were resumed in a series of resolutions [words 
indistinct] the rights of SIDS [Small Island Developing States] 
over the use and control of their natural resources, and they 
rejected unilateral policies of some developed countries against 
small states. They objected to what was termed imposition of 
models alien to the history and traditions of the small states. 
  The NGO's, led by Pacific, Caribbean, and (Indian) 
representatives, asked the Caribbean Community to support the UN 
General Assembly in trying to end the blockade of Cuba. 
  The NGO's condemned Caribbean nations which directly or 
indirectly support the military regime in Haiti. Even today, 
they said, reports indicate that Haitians are [word indistincts] 
the bodies left in the street at the mercy of dogs. [passage

  [Text] The major political parties have not yet reacted to 
the possibility of a U.S. military intervention in Haiti or to 
the announcement of a total embargo, as advocated by the United 
States. The big parties, such as Movement for the Establishment 
of Democracy in Haiti, National Agricultural and Industrial 
Party, National Front for Change and Democracy, Assembly of 
Progressive National Democrats, and Nationalistic Progressive 
Revolutionary Party of Haiti refrained from reacting, at least 
publicly, to those two hot points in the news. 
  The first reactions, however, have arrived. Some small 
political formations strongly criticized the new U.S. initiative 
to increase the sanctions and brandish the threat of a military 
intervention. Among the major political parties, we have the 
reaction of Professor Hubert de Ronceray , MDN [Mobilization For 
National Development], who received those statements as a new 
demonstration of contempt, aggression, and injustice toward the 
Haitian people. No to American intervention! No to any new 
occupation of Haiti! 
  The people's anti-Aristide organizations quickly reacted in 
condemning the statements of the United States president. Let us 
listen successively to the statements by Hubert de Ronceray from 
MDN; Jude L. Jean-Jacques of AJEPOPOA, Haitian People's Power 
Youth Organization; and Frank Pierre of Capois-la-Mort: 
  [Begin recording] [De Ronceray, in Creole] MDN finds it 
strange that a great country, a strong power like the United 
States of America does not see any other kind of democracy to 
offer us, sees no other kind of democracy to offer a small, poor 
country like Haiti but hunger, injustice, and death. 
  It is a shame, a waste, for such a huge power to lower 
itself 
to the point of agreeing to kill more Haitians and to send its 
own children to die for a chicken-minded priest who performs 
democracy with necklacing, iron cuts iron, and decapitation and 
the burning of homes. 
  MDN reminds everyone that nothing will change with the road 
we have taken with Article 149. It means the formation of an ad 
hoc government, the holding of elections for other CASEC's 
[Communal Section Administrative Councils], other mayors, other 
deputies, other senators, another president. 
  [Jean-Jacques, in Creole] In the face of threats of 
intervention being sent by some American legislators and the 
State Department spokesman; in view of the arrogance of some 
diplomats or spokesmen in the country asking for military 
intervention in Haiti, we are asking the president of the Senate 
office, Bernard Sansaricq, and the president of the Chamber of 
Deputies, Robert Monde, to assume their responsibilities so that 
a state authority can be established and the country's 
Constitution respected; to manage the criminal, insane UN/OAS 
embargo and defend the country's security. Up with political 
stability! Up with democracy! Down with anarchy! Down with U.S. 
intervention! 
  [Pierre] We say no, no, no; this will not do. Those people 
should not confuse 1915 with 1994. In 1915, the United States 
landed in Haiti and killed our children, brothers and sisters, 
aunts, grandfathers and grandmothers; then in 1994, from the 
generation of the great Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Charlemagne 
Perralte, and the great independence hero Capois-la-Mort, we say 
no, it will not happen. We have the blood of those ancestors in 
our veins. We in Capois-la-Mort ask the Haitian Army to neither 
give in nor to second guess what they heard. They must stand 
firm so the parliament can become strong because the Haitian 
Army is responsible for representing the country and watching 
over lives and property in Haiti. [end recording]

  [Text] Any solution to the crisis lies in the 
implementation of Article 149, according to statements by 
Professor Hubert de Ronceray who rose up again on 3 May against 
the latest statement of the White House, which does not even 
rule out a military intervention in Haiti. De Ronceray thinks 
if Article 149 is implemented, all conflicts and all threats 
will end. 
  [Begin De Ronceray recording, in French] As long as the 
United States of America and the international community refuse 
to understand that the true enemies of democracy are illiteracy, 
hunger, unemployment, the lack of road and energy 
infrastructures, they will have no other alternative than the 
physical destruction of the Haitian people. As for those who 
deny us the right to resort to Article 149 of our fundamental 
charter to solve an internal political problem which is a matter 
of concern within our sovereign competence, we want to ask them: 
Since when have the Governors Island agreement and the New York 
pact taken the place of the 1987 Constitution? Facing this 
watershed, heavy with ordeals and humiliation for the black 
Haitian nation, the Mobilization for National Development [MDN] 
calls on all genuine sons and daughters of our country to keep 
cool and to serenely resist the new challenges of the 
international giants. [end recording] 
  This was a statement by Prof. Hubert De Ronceray, leader of 
MDN.

  [Text] On 3 May, the National Coalition [CN] met at 1500 at 
the Villa Saint-Louis Hotel where they passed a resolution after 
several rounds. The CN asks in the resolution... [pauses] they 
say they condemn the interference in Haitian affairs of foreign 
countries under the pretext of defending democracy and human 
rights. 
  Second [as heard], the coalition advises that it 
energetically rejects any foreign military intervention by the 
United States or other countries in Haitian territory. 
  Third, they say they are in solidarity with all [words 
indistinct] while acknowledging the need to work toward reforms 
to be made in the country. 
  Fourth, the coalition reaffirms its resistance against 
foreign invaders (?and is) sounding the trumpet to prevent 
(?them) from walking on Haitian soil. 
  Fifth, the CN calls on all staunch Haitian citizens to work 
to put the Haitian nation back on his feet so it can once again 
find its place among the nations as the beacon of the black 
world. 
  Sixth, they ask the Haitian parliament to issue a verdict as 
a matter of urgency and in a precise and categorical manner 
against military intervention and the members' presence of the 
UN/OAS Civilian Mission in Haiti. 
  Seventh, they ask the Haitian Armed Forces to assume their 
responsibilities so as to allow the civilian authorities to 
actually take the nation's fate in hand and to accompany the 
people on the road to development and democracy. 
  b) [as heard] They ask the Haitian Army to stop all 
terrorist 
acts being committed throughout the country against people's 
lives and properties so as to avoid the trap set by all the 
destabilization professionals. They also ask the Army to 
organize, within its constitutional authority, the defense of 
the country's territory. 
  Eighth, in conclusion, the coalition asks the 
parliamentarians and the other powers in the country to 
consciously and independently make the decisions that are 
essential today so a head of state and a competent and 
responsible government -- inspired by Article 149 of the 
(?Constitution) -- can be appointed at the head of the country. 
They also ask that the deterioration process of the country set 
in motion by the international community reach an end. The CN 
resolution was passed by vote on 3 May at the Villa Saint-Louis 
Hotel.

  [Text] PANPRA [National Progressive Revolutionary Party of 
Haiti], led by Serge Gilles, has recommended realistic 
compromises on a series of democratic stakes to assure social 
peace and the country's governability. PANPRA in its monthly 
bulletin calls on democratic forces to create an historic, 
centrist, pluralist bloc and a legitimate constitutional 
transitional government of broad concord to fight political 
violence. 
  The socialist organization points out that all of the 
conservative forces have mobilized into a paramilitary 
organization with declared political ambitions, FRAPH 
[Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti]. 
Enjoying great impunity, this organization has imposed a 
nationwide campaign of intimidation, backed by blind, monstrous, 
indiscriminate violence. PANPRA adds that the poorest supporters 
of the president-in-exile often must choose between enrolling in 
FRAPH or being unbearably harassed. 
  PANPRA further criticizes the attitude of the international 
community, which is showing its true colors by playing the 
humanitarian samaritan while reinforcing the embargo. It can be 
assured that if President Aristide ever returns, all that will 
be left for him to govern will be zombis, piles of garbage, and 
a desert country.

Lara, deputy attorney general of the Baja California Government. 
He is being accused of providing support and protection to drug 
traffickers of the so-called Tijuana Cartel. The investigations 
could implicate him in the recent assassination of Federico 
Benitez Lopez, who was public security director in Tijuana. 
  Diego Valadez, attorney general of the republic, reported 
the 
arrest of the deputy attorney general of Baja California, Sergio 
Ortiz Lara, who was charged with association with criminal 
intent, abuse of authority against the administration of 
justice, and assisting in the escape of prisoners. He is 
accused of sheltering drug trafficker Ismael Higuera Guerrero, 
alias El Mayel, who headed the Arellano Felix band in the 3 
March assassination of Alejandro Castaneda, commander of the 
Federal Judicial Police. 
  [Begin Valadez recording] The incidents we have pointed out 
have taken place within a context of violence ranging from the 
confrontation between drug traffickers at Cristine discotheque 
in Puerto Vallarta to the recent murder of the Tijuana public 
security director, Federico Benitez Lopez. [end recording] 
  Diego Valadez said that in this context, in the preliminary 
investigations initiated on 3 March, the authorities must 
determine if the late Benitez Lopez had information that could 
lead to the arrest of Ortiz Lara and other officials in other 
crimes such as possible participation in issuing credentials to 
well-known drug traffickers. As for reports on a possible link 
in this case to the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the 
attorney general of the republic said there is no evidence of 
that.

<F P=106> [Report by Elena Gallegos and Emilio Lomas] </F>
  [Text] At noon yesterday, making his first statements as 
National Public Security Coordinator, Arsenio Farell Cubillas 
said this new office has been created because emerging 
circumstances in the country make it necessary to strengthen the 
legal regime "essential for safeguarding public peace." 
  Farell met with the media in the Carranza Room of the Los 
Pinos presidential residence. He was accompanied by Attorney 
General Diego Valades and Federal District Prosecutor Humberto 
Benitez Trevino. Valades said the new office "is a noble 
project." Benitez commented this is an efficacious response to 
the people's rightful demand for security. 
  The coordinator discussed the need for citizens to cooperate 
with the authorities in preventing and fighting crime. He 
reiterated what was said Monday during the announcement of the 
creation of the new office, that it will establish avenues for 
communication with the Secretariats of Government and Defense, 
the Navy, the Federal District, and state governments in 
"working to safeguard public order." Farell said his office 
will try to forge links among security corps so that they become 
more effective in both preventive tasks and the fight against 
crime. 
  The coordinator said the most adequate course will be sought 
to determine the guidelines and actions that must be undertaken 
by offices directly or indirectly in charge of matters having a 
bearing on public security. 
  Referring to Valades and Benitez, who were at his side, 
Farell said both are "old friends who have told me they want to 
cooperate enthusiastically in this endeavor which will 
strengthen peace in Mexico." 
  Valades and Benitez spoke later, after being introduced by 
Jose Carreno Carlon, the director general of the Presidency's 
Public Relations Office. Valades said he will work 
enthusiastically on the mission the president assigned to Farell 
for the sake of the country's security. He noted: "As an aide to 
the president of the country, as a public official, a citizen, 
and an attorney, I am convinced of this project's worthiness and 
of the need for establishing efficient coordination mechanisms." 
  As Valades sees it, "no one better than an illustrious 
attorney, a distinguished public figure, an eminent teacher, and 
an outstanding Mexican could lead this coordination effort." He 
continued referring to Farell by noting: "He will have all my 
support and that of all officials in the Attorney General's 
Office." 
  Immediately thereafter, Federal District Attorney General 
Humberto Benitez Trevino spoke in more or less the same terms as 
Valades. He pledged to support Farell "so the people will have 
what they deserve and are demanding: more and better security." 
  Benitez Trevino said: "Our chief, President Salinas, has 
appointed Arsenio Farell, an exceptional Mexican, a man of law, 
an impeccable public servant, and an accredited university 
professor. He is the best guarantee that the inhabitants of the 
entire country will have the improved security which they are 
rightfully demanding." 
  Thus concluded the Public Security coordinator's brief 
presentation to the news media. Later, reporters received 
copies of the agreement whereby the new office was created, 
which was published yesterday in the DIARIO OFFIICAL DE LA 
FEDERACION [official gazette]. 
  The agreement establishes that it will be the coordinator's 
duty to: coordinate national public security actions established 
by the federal executive in accordance with applicable laws; 
establish mechanisms for the Attorney General's Office of the 
republic and the attorney general in the Federal District to 
adequately and efficiently fulfill their duties; and to propose 
pertinent measures and establish agreements with the state 
attorney generalships on national public security matters. 
  The presidential agreement also points out that the 
coordinator will propose and establish efficient and timely 
channels of communication between the aforementioned 
institutions to safeguard national public security; it will 
coordinate and follow up on the agreements that are reached by 
the National Security Cabinet, sending them to the president of 
the republic for consideration and to ensure their fulfillment. 
The coordinator will also carry out duties entrusted to him 
expressly by the federal executive. 
  Finally, the agreement establishes that federal 
administration departments and institutions will provide, in a 
timely manner, the coordinator with the information and support 
he may require to fulfill his duties.

  [Text] Today, the Mexican president said his government is 
duty-bound to guarantee that the law prevails. Democracy and 
law go together and cannot be separated, President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari said at Los Pinos presidential residence when 
he received the 1994 Norma Corona Sapiens Award, granted by the 
Association of Litigant Lawyers of Mexico for the Defense of 
Human Rights. 
  Salinas was decorated with the national award named after 
Norma Corona Sapiens, a lawyer from Sinaloa who defended human 
rights and who was murdered during her struggle against drug 
traffickers associated with policemen. As a result of her 
murder, President Salinas created the National Human Rights 
Commission, which he later incorporated into the Constitution. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] My government has assigned top 
priority to the defense of human rights under all circumstances 
and with all due authority. I have pledged to guarantee rule of 
law. [end recording] 
  Even though he admitted there is much more to be done, the 
president said Mexico's legal system is at the vanguard of this 
century. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] Fighting against criminal bands, 
particularly those of drug traffickers, is indispensable for 
guaranteeing the civilized coexistence of society. [end 
recording] 
  Maximo Carvajal, dean of the School of Law of the Autonomous 
University of Mexico, said the award was given to President 
Salinas for his work in defending human rights in Mexico.

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria said on Monday 
that the National Police [PN] will continue to function until 
the territorial and functional deployment of the PNC [National 
Civilian Police] is completed; the process, he said, could last 
into 1995. 
  According to the peace agreements, the PN must be dismantled 
by October. Nevertheless, Santamaria pointed out that a total 
demobilization may be delayed until December, depending on the 
PNC deployment process. He gave assurances that the FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] had agreed to this, 
but former guerrilla member Leonel Gonzalez denied the assertion. 
  [Begin recording] [Gonzalez] To extend the PN's existence is 
to lend institutional support to the crime problem. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is there a pact between the 
government and FMLN to postpone the PN's demise, yes or no? 
  [Gonzalez] Such a pact does not exist. There is no pact. 
[end recording] 
  The FMLN leader said this matter is among the issues most 
widely debated by both sides, but no specific agreement has been 
reached thus far. 
  The FMLN does not intend to reschedule the PN's 
demobilization and is thus requesting that the PNC be deployed 
more rapidly. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] What we have agreed upon so far 
is 
that the deployment must conclude by September. By September, 
approximately 5,700 troops must be trained and deployed. The 
deployment must conclude at latest in September or October and 
the PN must disappear. [end recording] 
  Gonzalez said the PN issue will be discussed in depth with 
UN 
mediation because the government intends to transfer 
approximately 1,300 PN members to the PNC in addition to the 
quota established in the peace agreements.

<F P=106> [Report by Mario Jovel from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The government has reacted promptly to differences 
within the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] 
legislative bloc. On Tuesday, President Alfredo Cristiani 
asserted that the differences among the various FMLN groups only 
confirm his prediction on the night of 24 April, when ARENA 
[Nationalist Republican Alliance] celebrated its presidential 
victory. 
  President Cristiani believes the differences that have 
appeared among the FMLN deputies because of the election of Ana 
Guadalupe Martinez and German Cienfuegos as Legislative Assembly 
vice president and secretary, respectively, simply confirm the 
divisions that have always existed in this political party, as 
was pointed out by his government and ARENA a long time ago. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] The FMLN is an association of 
five groups with ideological differences, which -- and let us 
put it this way -- got together to fight a war. Now that we no 
longer have a war and now that politics prevail, those 
differences have come out in the open. [end recording] 
  According to the president, the differences among the former 
guerrillas will increase in future debates at the Legislative 
Assembly, because there are different ideological positions 
within the FMLN. 
  Referring to the peace accords, Cristiani reiterated that 
the 
assignment of 5,700 PNC [National Civilian Police] policemen 
will conclude before October. He confirmed, however, the 
National Police's demobilization will take a bit longer. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] A great deal depends, of course, 
on the Public Security Academy's graduations. We cannot go 
faster than the academy that graduates the policemen. We 
believe, however, that the transition period will have to be 
extended at least six months. [end recording] 
  Cristiani admitted that there has been no agreement with the 
FMLN to extend the National Police's demobilization. According 
to the president, this is because the front has refused to look 
for alternatives with the government and Onusal [UN Observers 
for El Salvador] so that Calderon Sol's administration will not 
encounter public security problems. If no agreements are 
reached this month, the president-elect will be the one to 
decide whether or not the total demobilization of the National 
Police will be extended.

<F P=106> ["Urgent" press release issued by FMLN General Coordinator </F>
Shafik Handal in San Salvador on 3 May; from the "KL Radio News" 
newscast -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Regarding the events that have taken place at the 
first plenary session of the new Legislative Assembly, the 
general coordinator of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] informs the Salvadoran people and the general 
public worldwide that: 
  1. At several meetings, during which the Political 
Commission of the FMLN examined in detail the operational and 
organizational conditions of the new Legislative Assembly, the 
Political Commission unanimously agreed that the assembly's 
current internal organization imposes a presidentialist system 
[regimen presidencialista] that fails to proportionately reflect 
representation that characterizes this branch of state and that 
it obstructs the democratic fulfillment of parliamentary and 
legislative endeavors. For this reason, the commission agreed 
to seek a consensus with all political parties and their 
deputies to reform the internal organization and thereby 
democratize the Legislative Assembly, demanding, among other 
things, the formation of a board of directors that more 
accurately reflects the ratios achieve in the 20 March elections. 
  2. While we held these discussions, ARENA [Nationalist 
Republican Alliance] unexpectedly had the previous Legislative 
Assembly approve, at its final session on the evening on 29 
April, a reform of the regulation that set the number of board 
members at 10 and granted a double vote to the assembly 
president -- now a female president. ARENA has thereby seized a 
majority that the people did not grant the party by way of their 
votes. The reform states that under no circumstances can the 
opposition make decisions within the board of directors without 
the board's approval. This reform has worsened the assembly's 
presidentialist and antidemocratic nature. 
  3. This situation was exacerbated by the decision of ARENA 
and some of its allies to break away from the consensus achieved 
at Copaz [National Commission for the Consolidation of Peace] to 
reform the Constitution on those points recommended by the Truth 
Commission. The message was clear: ARENA has decided to exert 
its influence and turn its back on the commitments that emerged 
from the Chapultepec Agreement. 
  4. In response to this new situation, the Political 
Commission, expanded by the participation of elected FMLN 
deputies, decided by a majority vote not to participate in the 
Legislative Assembly's board of directors until its internal 
organization is reformed, and to announce that the FMLN will 
soon present a bill explaining this. In turn, the FMLN's 
Political Commission has abstained from approving any individual 
candidates or lists of candidates for positions within the 
Legislative Assembly Directorate. 
  5. Despite this situation, seven deputies from our 
legislative faction voted during the board elections at the 1 
May plenary and two of them, Ana Guadalupe Martinez and Eduardo 
Sancho, accepted the posts of vice president and secretary, 
respectively. 
  6. Consequently, we must make it clear to all that these 
deputies do not represent the FMLN as a faction or the FMLN 
itself in the Legislative Assembly's board of directors, and 
that none of their actions, opinions, or commitments are binding 
with the FMLN. In this way, the FMLN's representation has been 
usurped with the support of the ARENA deputies' votes. 
  7. The general coordinator of the FMLN is discussing this 
problem to the party's rank-and-file and factions to enable the 
FMLN to make relevant decisions. 
  8. The FMLN will remain faithful to democratic revolutionary 
ideology, popular interests, programs of democratization, and 
social justice, as outlined in the Chapultepec agreement and the 
FMLN's Charter, goals, and programmatic platform, and it will 
redouble its efforts to achieve their fulfillment. 
  [Dated] San Salvador, 3 May 94 
  [Signed] Shafik Jorge Handal, general coordinator of the 
FMLN

  [Text] Foreign Minister Gladys Maritza Ruiz de Vielman has 
said that Guatemala is waiting for the United States to 
establish the criteria for it and the other Central American 
countries to join NAFTA, which also includes Mexico and Canada. 
  She said Guatemala could easily meet any prerequisites those 
countries might impose in order to participate in the trade 
bloc, considered one of the largest in the world. She said it 
is plausible that our country could be given "parity" treatment, 
even though the criteria for eligibility to receive this 
preferential treatment has not been established, because 
Guatemala meets the technical and quality prerequisites to 
expedite its inclusion into NAFTA. 
  "Last month I was in Washington, and I held some talks 
regarding this possibility, which is why I am optimistic and why 
I believe Guatemala will be among the first countries to receive 
parity," she said. 
  She explained this procedure meant receiving the benefits 
derived from NAFTA, but she clearly stated this is a unilateral 
step taken by the United States and not by the other NAFTA 
members. 
  Ruiz de Vielman said there was no deadline set to achieve 
"parity." Everything concerning this issue is subject to U.S. 
approval, although she emphasized that the U.S. authorities are 
"very sympathetic" toward Guatemala's case. 
  At any rate, she said, in the future any negotiation or 
petition regarding NAFTA must be conducted on a regional, not 
individual, level in order to guarantee a swift and firm reply 
to Central American proposals.

agreement -- together with the one signed in Paris last 29 April 
-- constitutes a major step forward toward the clear 
implementation of the historic agreements reached in the city of 
Washington on 13 September 1993." 
  The official communique concludes by stating that "the 
Argentine Government wishes to once again underscore the courage 
of the Israeli and Palestinian leaders who, with discretion,

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 May (NA) -- The Buenos Aires 
delegates to the Constituent Assembly from the Radical Civic 
Union [UCR], Modin [Movement for Independence and Dignity], and 
the Grand Front (FG), today agreed "not to support the immediate 
reelection of the current Buenos Aires governor and vice 
governor, a decision which is meant, they said, to "comply with 
the responsibilities of their mandates." [quotation marks as 
received] 
  After the meeting among the leaders and delegates of the 
three political forces, which was held at UCR headquarters, they 
released a five-point document stating that the amendment of the 
Constitution "requires an effort by the political forces to 
attain a constitution that reflects the people's will as 
expressed on 10 April." 
  It also points out the need to "intensify democracy by 
strengthening the civic liberties, rights, and well-being of the 
inhabitants of Buenos Aires Province." 
  "In order to meet these objectives, we hereby request the 
support of all the political parties participating in the 
Constituent Assembly, and invite the Justicialist Party 
delegates to hold a joint meeting," the second point of the 
document states. 
  In addition it establishes that "in compliance with the 
electoral commitment assumed with the Buenos Aires public," the 
position of rejecting the possibility of reelecting the 
provincial governor will be maintained. 
  The FG, Modin, and UCR delegates also said that they "reject 
the introduction of any kind of subterfuge in the constitutional 
reform that seeks to alter the public's decision to oppose the 
immediate reelection of the current provincial governors." 
  Finally, the delegates maintained that the Constituent 
Assembly "must be carried out within a pluralistic framework 
that guarantees the openness of its decisions and of its 
expenses."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 May (NA) -- The Grand Front (FG) and 
the Socialist Unity (US) today agreed to create a Political 
Action Commission that will outline a program of cooperation and 
the election strategy for an eventual alliance, with an eye to 
the 1995 elections. 
  In addition, the leaders of the two coalitions decided that 
their members in the Constituent Assembly, which is to be held 
in the cities of Santa Fe and Parana, will work "together," and 
thus the two blocs will hold their first meeting in Congress on 
6 April. 
  The resolutions were adopted during a meeting at FG 
headquarters between the FG and the US. Attending for the FG 
were: Fernando Solanas, Carlos Chacho Alvarez, Patricio 
Echegaray, Marcelo Vensentini, Carlos Auyero, Anibal Ibarra, and 
Mary Sanchez; and for the US: Norberto La Porta, Alfredo Bravo, 
Hector Bravo, Guillermo Estevez Boero, Ernesto Jaimovich, Mario 
Mazitelli, and Jose Seoane.

  [Text] (NA-DYN) -- With only two days to go before the key 
gathering that will decide their party's future, Cordoba 
Governor Eduardo Angeloz announced after talks with Radical 
Chairman Raul Alfonsin yesterday that he will head a committee 
that will have the task of reorganizing the party following last 
month's defeat at the polls. 
  During the 45-minute meeting held at Alfonsin's Barrio 
Norter 
apartment, Angeloz -- one of the few Radical leaders to win the 
April 10 Constituent Assembly elections in his province -- 
confirmed that his delegates will attend Friday's National 
Committee meeting in Vicente Lopez. The body is scheduled to 
receive a final report from Alfonsin on the balloting, in which 
the Radicals trailed the ruling Justicialist Party by nearly 20 
percentage points. 
  Alfonsin needs the support of the pro-Angeloz delegates at 
the plenary meeting to face off the opposition of the so-called 
Group of 44 Radicals, who oppose the constitutional reform pact 
signed by Alfonsin and President Carlos Menem and are expected 
to question Alfonsin's leadership. 
  One of the anti-reform camp leaders, Senator Fernando de la 
Rua, told Radio 9.90 that he was "waiting for a change in the 
party's leadership." 
  Commenting on the Angeloz-Alfonsin summit -- originally 
scheduled to take place last week -- the senator said: "The 
most important result of the talks is that the reorganization of 
the party was discussed." 
  Another anti-reform Radical, Deputy Federico Storani, told a 
local news agency that he was "optimistic" that the meeting 
"will unlock" the internal conflict. 
  Angeloz, in turn, said that Alfonsin will continue as 
Radical 
head until the end of the Constituent Assembly, which will open 
in Parana and Santa Fe on May 25. 
  The governor announced that he will head a committee of 
"political action" which will start a round of talks with all 
the party's internal sectors. 
  Angeloz also met yesterday with the heads of the Radical 
Lower and Upper House caucuses, Deputy Raul Galvan and Senator 
Jose Genoud, in what is seen as the start of an attempt to 
resolve the party's internal crisis. 
  Angeloz admitted that he had a difficult task ahead and 
announced that he will remain in the Federal Capital to continue 
talks "to united and strengthen the party." 
  De la Rua meanwhile confirmed that he still hoped to be the 
party's presidential candidate in 1995. But he underlined that 
"it is not time yet to formally launch the candidacy." 
  In related news, the Radical Party Youth yesterday issued a 
statement demanding the resignation of the National Committee 
led by Alfonsin and holding it responsible for the April 10 
defeat.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 4 May (NA) -- The family of Army 
Commander Lieutenant General Martin Balza has received death 
threats in an anonymous message that demands that the death of 
conscript Omar Carrasco not be investigated, as "the Neuquen 
case is closed." 
  Pablo Balza, 23, son of the general, today found on the 
windshield of his car a typewritten note in which his father is 
threatened with death and which contained details about the 
family life of the general's children. [passage omitted] 
  Military sources state that this is not the first time that 
Gen. Balza and his family have received death threats.

  [Text] ANF -- At an international antinarcotics conference 
that has been under way in Quito, Ecuador, since last week, 
Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz said the Colombian cartels, 
and mainly the Cali cartel, are establishing themselves in 
Bolivia to produce cocaine on a large scale. 
  "We could be facing the imminent and increasing transfer of 
foreign criminal drug organizations to Bolivia," said Soliz, in 
a speech before the 12th International Drug Enforcement 
Conference (IDEC). 
  He said the drug trafficking organizations, and especially 
those from Colombia, are able to subjugate the most important 
indigenous organizations in gaining control over the entire drug 
circuit, from producing coca to cocaine paste, refined cocaine, 
and the export and marketing of pure cocaine. 
  He added: "The Colombian drug rings hope to establish their 
own supply system for the chemicals they need, as it is known 
that they want to complete the circuit by refining their own 
production." 
  Soliz said that to estimate the presence of illegal 
chemicals 
in Bolivian territory "is a frightening exercise, as the huge 
border regions shared with our neighbors are the natural habitat 
for unique species of animals and plants, with rivers full of an 
impressive variety of fish, and with fertile land suitable for 
all manner of cultivation." 
  Soliz added: "This entire habitat where ancient ethnic 
groups live, forming a natural ecosystem, alive and without 
contamination, is now in danger due to the voracity of drug 
traffickers and their suppliers of chemicals."

  [Text] After lengthy internal meetings and conversations, 
the PFL [Liberal Front Party] has designated Alagoas Senator 
Guilherme Palmeira as Fernando Henrique Cardoso's running mate 
for the presidential elections of 3 October. 
  The PFL also considered the designation of Senator Marco 
Maciel, but he declined. 
  The PFL informed Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the 
designation during a lunch. Cardoso was satisfied with the 
designation. He said: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] It is a good choice because we 
need 
someone from the northeastern region, with political experience, 
with well-known positions, and who will be accepted by the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. Guilherme Palmeira meets 
these requirements. In addition, he can help us a lot because 
he is a factor for unity within the PFL, and this is important 
for the electoral contest in the northeastern region. [end 
recording] 
  The PSDB is scheduled to hold its convention on 14 May in 
Contagem, Minas Gerais. The convention will formalize Senator 
Cardoso's designation as presidential candidate.

<F P=106> [Article by Edilson Coelho] </F>
  [Text] The principal national weapons manufacturers are 
looking abroad for an alternative to their low domestic sales. 
The main Brazilian arms industries -- CBC [Brazilian Ammunition 
Company], Taurus, Rossi, Boito, Urco, and Imbel [War Materiel 
Industry] -- which are currently earning $300 million annually, 
export about 75 percent of their production. CBC, which belongs 
to the Arbi and Imbel groups, is investing $2.7 million in a 
publicity campaign to promote its Pump CBC 12 shotgun. CBC 
expects to sell 9,000 of the shotguns this year, at a price 
between $400 and $800 each. 
  Domestic sales amount to nearly 220,000 units per year. 
Taurus and Rossi from Rio Grande do Sul sell mainly handguns 
and revolvers. They account for nearly 90 percent of legal arms 
sales. CBC believes it may double its domestic sales this year. 
The publicity campaign, which began in March and which will 
last until December, with striking adds that explain the 
product, is part of the sales support strategy. Distribution is 
the strong point of CBC. "We deliver our product within five 
days," says Operations Manager Marco Aurelio Salvany. CBC sells 
its products through 500 stores. 
  CBC turned to the domestic market after a restructuring 
process which combined productivity and a dollar price reduction 
of up to 54 percent. "We will expand domestically, taking 
advantage of our increased production capability," Salvany said. 
  CBC has invested $1.8 million in machinery, equipment, and 
new processes. CBC will invest $10 million in 1994 and 1995 to 
increase its ammunition production. 
  CBC is considered the largest Brazilian ammunition 
manufacturer with a production of 221 million cartridges in 
1992. It also produced a total 32,000 units of the Pump CBC 12. 
CBC sells ammunition in the United States under the trademark 
Magtech. It expects to manufacture 90,000 units this year, only 
10 percent of which will remain in Brazil. 
  With the recession at the beginning of the 1990's, other 
national manufacturers targeted the international market. As a 
result of large export operations -- mainly to the United States 
-- Taurus opened the Taurus International Manufacturing 
subsidiary which is responsible for 52 percent of its $51.2 
million sales last year. It produced 400,000 handguns and 
revolvers. Taurus is the third most popular handgun in the 
United States. 
  For Rossi, which was founded 105 years ago, selling abroad 
was a way to survive. Rossi's .38-caliber 5-shot revolver -- 
the main competitor for Taurus in revolvers -- is the company's 
best-selling product. It accounts for $30 million worth of 
annual sales. In 1989 Rossi adopted a Total Quality Program to 
improve productivity and to compete with the United States and 
Canada where it must compete with the famous Colt, Rugger, and 
Smith and Wesson revolvers. 
  "When the recession hit the United States we had good 
quality 
and the best market prices," says Rossi Sales Manager Paulo 
Schilling. He said that 60 percent of Rossi's production is 
exported. 
  The Boito company, a small hunting weapon manufacturer, is 
based in Veranopolis, Rio Grande do Sul. It has annual sales of 
$12 million and is also engaged in exports. Following the 
philosophy of its founder, Elias Ruas Amantino, the company has 
never produced the personal security weapons that could increase 
its sales in Brazil and in the countries to where it sends 95 
percent of its production. "We know we are losing an opportunity 
to make money, but we respect the principle established by our 
founder," says Commercial Manager Manoel Ruas Amantino. 
  CBC was founded in 1926 by the Matarazzo family to produce 
bullets for hunting weapons. The company currently belongs to 
the Arbi and Imbel groups. It is investing $10 million to 
transform itself into one of the most modern ammunition 
manufacturers in the world. With the purchase of new, totally 
automated equipment from Germany, Italy, and Belgium, CBC will 
soon be producing four cartridges per second. 
  "We will be able to modify our production at any moment 
without quality loss," says Operations Manager Marco Aurelio 
Salvany. Installed in Maua, greater Sao Paulo, the company 
manufactures from .22-caliber ammunition to projectiles for FAB 
[Brazilian Air Force] fighters. Of the $100 million CBC plans 
to earn this year, 88 percent will come from cartridge sales. 
  Beside the modernization project -- quality control will be 
computerized -- the CBC is linking its network of distributors. 
"The sales team will work on cellular telephone-linked notebooks 
[preceding word given in English]," Salvany says. Orders will 
be logged in the central CBC computer so as to inform the 
production line. "The saving of time is essential for 
competitiveness," he says. The idea is to deliver orders within 
24 hours. 
  Having conquered the Brazilian market, CBC intends to do the 
same abroad, where it has 45 distributors selling in 65 
countries. "We want to be among the main weapon and ammunition 
manufacturers in the world," Salvany said. 
  Report on the weapons market in 1993 
  Sales: $300 million 
  Weapons sold: 225,000 units in Brazil and 775,000 units 
abroad. 
  Regional participation in sales: Southeast (44 percent); 
South (16 percent); Center West (15 percent); Northeast (20 
percent); and North (5 percent). 
  Ammunition sales in Brazil: 97.9 million cartridges. 
  Ammunition exports: 114 million cartridges. 
  Companies: CBC (Sao Paulo); Rossi (Rio Grande do Sul); 
Taurus (Rio Grande do Sul); Boito (Rio Grande do Sul); Urco (Sao 
Paulo); and Imbel (Sao Paulo). 
  Jobs: 10,000 direct and indirect jobs 
  Most sold model: .38-caliber five-shot revolver (price: 
$250) 
  Investment to increase production: $10 million this year 
in CBC.

<F P=106> [Report by Lidia Reboucas in Sao Paulo] </F>
  [Text] Military research was one of the most controversial 
topics discussed at the International Seminar on the Evaluation 
of and Proposals for Scientific and Technological Development in 
Brazil, which was held in Sao Paulo. The seminar focused on new 
courses for scientific and technological development in Brazil. 
  Controversies erupted over maintaining a model inherited 
from 
the military period (which envisaged the creation of a large 
military power through a scientific and technological effort 
undertaken by the Armed Forces) and over discontinuing 
military-oriented projects. 
  Among the ongoing military projects that are worth 
mentioning 
are the AMX aircraft, the Brazilian Space Mission project (which 
totals $1.1 billion), and a nuclear-powered submarine project 
($900 million). 
  Geraldo Lesbat Cagnari Filho, director of the Group of 
Strategic Studies at Campinas State University [Unicamp], said: 
"These projects will provide the Brazilian military industry 
with great technological capability, and it will thus gain 
international standing." 
  This opinion is not, however, shared by some researchers, 
who 
find it necessary to make a comprehensive review of the benefits 
yielded by these military projects. 
  One who advocates this idea is Renato Peixoto Dagnino, of 
the 
technological department at the Unicamp Geoscience Institute, 
who believes that "the only benefits these projects will yield 
are academic ones, and not technological nor military." 
  The search for new sources of financing that are not closely 
linked to the government, and cooperation between the private 
sector and Brazilian universities in undertaking joint 
scientific and technological research, were also among the main 
topics discussed at the seminar. 
  Helio Barros, planning secretary at the Science and 
Technology Ministry, said: "The Brazilian Government is not 
planning to increase funds allocated for science and technology, 
which this year will stand at $900 million." 
  He added that this is happening because "the country's 
budget 
system does not envisage specific investments in this area, and 
thus the budgeted funds are not earmarked for any specific 
project." In the past two years only 40 percent of the approved 
budget has been disbursed.

  [Text] After returning from the United States, Finance 
Minister Eduardo Aninat said today that Chile hopes to sign a 
free trade agreement with the United States by March 1995. 
  This comment was made by Aninat after meeting with President 
Eduardo Frei at La Moneda at noon today. Aninat, who arrived 
back in Chile early this morning, met with President Frei to 
brief him on the results of his trip. In Washington Aninat met 
with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor, and the two 
agreed to start preliminary negotiations on 25 May, prior to 
beginning formal negotiations on a free trade agreement. 
  [Begin Aninat recording] We will not sign just any pact. We 
will sign a pact that is very rational, very coherent, in line 
with our economic policy, and suitable for Chile. In addition, 
before signing a pact we would discuss it with the political 
parties and, of course, with Congress. [end recording] 
  Aninat said that Chile has not yet decided whether to 
negotiate a bilateral agreement with the United States or to 
join NAFTA, which is also made up of Mexico and Canada. The 
importance of a free trade agreement with the United States lies 
in the fact that one-third of Chile's international trade is 
currently with the United States.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said today that 
Chile is putting the finishing touches on an agreement to link 
up with the Common Market of the South, Mercosur. 
  Figueroa explained that Mercosur is seen by the great powers 
and by international investors as one of the most interesting 
centers for investment. Mercosur includes the two largest South 
American countries, Argentina and Brazil, which are Chile's main 
trade partners. 
  [Begin Figueroa recording] In all of the bilateral meetings 
between the Mercosur country presidents and then President 
Patricio Aylwin, and now with President Eduardo Frei, the 
Mercosur countries' interest in having Chile become a member has 
been very clear. [end recording] 
  Figueroa said that the decision regarding Mercosur cannot be 
delayed. He explained, however, that Chile cannot join Mercosur 
as a member due to the high tariff rate of that common market. 
This is why, he said, the Foreign Ministry is preparing a 
formula to reach an agreement with Mercosur as a whole.

  [Text] The controversy on whether Carabineros Director 
General Rodolfo Stange will resume his post continues. Stange's 
lawyer has stated that the high-ranking officer has not 
requested leave, yet the defense minister has said he has 
already approved it. 
  Gen. Stange began his vacations on 8 April. His vacations 
end on 16 May. Stange's lawyer, Pablo Rodriguez, has said that 
Stange has not requested an extension. He added that the acting 
Carabineros director has submitted a written communication to 
the defense minister which states that Stange was to have taken 
two months leave if a military judge was appointed to 
investigate charges on military negligence. He said: 
  [Begin Rodriguez recording] As this is not the case, Gen. 
Stange will not submit any leave request. A request is uncalled 
for in compliance with Gen. Stange's original position. If a 
civilian judge is appointed to investigate the case, there is no 
legal, constitutional, moral, or ethical obstacles to prevent 
him from resuming his post. [end recording] 
  Defense Minister Patricio Rojas, however, said that Gen. 
Stange will not resume his post before July. 
  [Begin recording] [Rojas in progress]... This is the 
situation right now. His vacation expires on 17 May and from 
then on, he will start a 60-day leave permit that can be reduced 
or extended. 
  [Unidentified reporter] You have to authorize it. 
  [Rojas] I have already authorized it. He has requested leave 
and I have already authorized it. [end recording]

  [Text] Recently appointed Supreme Court Justice Eleodoro 
Ortiz has voiced his opposition to a possible law on divorce. 
  The new justice was a member of the Court of Appeals in 
Concepcion. President Eduardo Frei telephoned Judge Ortiz to 
tell him of his appointment as Supreme Court justice. Judge 
Eleodoro Ortiz has been on the bench since 1969, when he was 
nominated as appellate judge in Concepcion under President 
Eduardo Frei Montalva. 
  He believes the streamlining of judicial processes merits 
urgent consideration and that judges should be vested with the 
power of expeditiously passing sentence in less serious crimes. 
He believes the jurisdiction of military justice ought to be 
restricted and that the best guarantee for human rights is to 
facilitate access to the law by the widest sectors. With regard 
to a possible law on divorce, he categorically asserted: 
  [Begin Ortiz recording] The current system has come under 
fire because nullity suits are said to be a farce. Nothing will 
prevent this very farce from continuing unabated with the 
passing of a law on divorce. [end recording] 
  The new Supreme Court justice declined to comment on the 
mushrooming of schools of law in the country.

  [Text] The prosecutor general of the nation sparked a new 
controversy when he said that the war on drug trafficking is a 
failure. He is now confronting the Drug Police, and he has his 
own figures and balance. With the following figures Prosecutor 
General Gustavo De Greiff summarized, point by point, his own 
balance. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] Marijuana consumption has 
skyrocketed, while cocaine and heroin consumption has suddenly 
increased. What kind of success is this? Not even 10 percent 
of the drugs that reach the markets or are even meant to reach 
the international markets are seized. What kind of success is 
this? 
  The public force in Colombia killed Mr. Rodriguez Gacha, 
killed Mr. Pablo Escobar, extradited Mr. Ledher, imprisoned 
several drug traffickers. None of these events, however, has 
led to any variations in the illegal drug market. What kind of 
success is this? [end recording] 
  Once again, De Greiff has used these figures to support his 
proposal for studying the legalization of drugs in Colombia. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] I am not becoming an advocate 
for 
the legalization of drugs. Nonetheless, I believe it is a 
weapon that will destroy the wealth of drug traffickers. [end 
recording] 
  Predicting the United States will probably unleash a storm 
against him as a result of these statements, De Greiff warned 
that he is ill. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] I have a strange disease in my 
spine that does not allow me to bend before those who are 
powerful. [end recording]

fight refuted the prosecutor general's assessments. 
  [Colonel Jose Antonio Gallego, chief of the Narcotics 
Division] "I personally and professionally respect all 
observations made by the prosecutor general, but I cannot share 
that statement because it is very obvious that following the 
death of Gonzalo Rodiguez Gacha and Pablo Escobar, drug 
trafficking in Colombia was completely reduced to zero by the 
national government." 
  As for the increase in the amount of cultivated areas: 
  [Gallego] "That is not completely true because, as regards 
coca plantations, we have seen an increase since last year that 
is not more than 5 or 7 percent. The same is not true for 
marijuana or poppy plantations." 
  As for the small number of drug and money confiscations: 
  [Gallego] "We can say that we have confiscated plenty of 
drugs of different types in the country." 
  As for the small number of drug traffickers in jail: 
  [Gallego] "The National Police, alone, in the first four 
months of 1994, have arrested 450 Colombians and 42 foreigners 
involved in the trafficking of drugs." 
  As for the increase in drug consumption: 
  [Gallego] "An increase in consumption is relative. If it is 
indeed happening, it should not be in significant numbers 
because indicators show that, at this time, there is less 
availability of the substance than in previous years."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the 
Colombian Senate strongly condemned what it views as U.S. 
meddling in Colombia's judicial system. During a debate that 
lasted several hours, the legislative branch closed ranks around 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, whom the U.S. State 
Department has accused of acting independently in the Colombian 
Government's struggle against the mafia. 
  Senator Fernando Mendoza said the country to the north "has 
no moral basis for criticizing the Colombian authorities." He 
noted: "In Colombia, people die from drug traffickers' bullets, 
while in the United States people die as a result of overdose." 
  Senate President Jorge Ramon Elias criticized the position 
of 
Colombian Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez for maintaining a 
weak stand in the face of criticism from U.S. congressmen and 
U.S. officials in Colombia. Gonzalez, promoter of a bill 
calling for stronger penalties against the mafia, admitted that 
"the nation's sovereignty is being threatened not only by 
foreign pressure, which we must reject strongly and with 
dignity, but also by crime." 
  During the debate at the Senate session to which De Greiff 
was summoned, the senators discussed an eventual modification of 
the Criminal Procedure Code and, especially, the possibility of 
toughening sentences handed down on confessed drug-traffickers 
who surrender to authorities. 
  Liberal Party Senator Humberto Pelaez said the executive 
branch's proposal to reform penal legislation "is the result of 
U.S. pressure." Senator Maria Izquierdo, of the same party, 
cautioned that Congress will not make changes to this law. 
  The Criminal Procedure Code grants significant sentence 
reductions to drug traffickers who surrender to authorities, 
confess to at least one crime, and collaborate in the arrest of 
other criminals. The code also envisages releasing prisoners 
who spend six months in prison without being brought before a 
court. 
  Last Sunday, President Gaviria decreed, for the third time 
in 
the past two years, a state of internal disturbance, which 
enables him to issue or void public order decrees to prevent the 
release of more than 800 inmates, most of whom are accused of 
drug trafficking or terrorism. 
  According to U.S. congressmen and other U.S. officials, De 
Greiff has adopted a "weak" position in his negotiations on 
sentencing Cali Cartel and Medellin Cartel bosses. 
  De Greiff has denied the charges and reiterated: "I am not 
scared of a foreign power or pressure from organized crime." 
The prosecutor general quipped at the Senate's full session: 
"I suffer from a strange spinal disease that prevents me from 
bending down in front of the powerful."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Who Pulled the Trigger?"] </F>
  [Text] The general strike that paralyzed the country 
yesterday tested the mechanisms for coexistence that the entire 
Paraguayan people want and yearn for. An event that should have 
gone unnoticed -- because it is an unavoidable part of the 
political and legal system -- took on a tragic significance with 
the death of a young peasant and the unprovoked aggression 
against various journalists, including four Private 
Communication Network reporters. 
  One fact that encourages us to meditate was clearly visible 
at the end of the demonstration yesterday: Paraguayan democracy 
needs to mature. Intemperance, authoritarianism, arrogance, and 
resentment is still a very heavy burden on many fellow 
Paraguayans' minds. It requires only a spark, or the slightest 
encouragement, for these negative feelings to erupt in the most 
irrational way imaginable. 
  That is what happened yesterday with the consequences we 
must 
all regret today. We have said in this column that the strike 
was a right established by law and a legitimate weapon for union 
struggle. We have also said that the exercise of that right 
should never mean infringement on other people's right to go to 
their work places. Traffic interruption and the attacks against 
bus drivers are, without doubt, acts that we cannot in any way 
approve. 
  We also believe that the attack against journalists was 
totally unjustified. We must make here a basic analysis: If 
only one journalist had been injured we could have accepted it 
-- in a preliminary way -- as an unfortunate accident, something 
that could occur anywhere in the world. But we had several 
attacks and must, therefore, conclude that the incident was more 
serious, that journalists were seen as necessary targets of 
physical aggression for their responsibility in the events. 
  We cannot forget that for months the government has been 
formulating the odd accusation that it is the press which 
invents the problems. The president of the Republic has made 
this accusation on several occasions in the angry tone that has 
become part of his communication style. 
  And what is even worse, during a meeting between the 
president and political leaders at government palace we heard 
threats in a tone that Paraguayans are no longer used to hearing 
and which seemed taken from the last months of 1988. What was 
most serious was the fact that the president, forgetting his 
position as president, accompanied those threats in general 
terms against all those who use their legitimate right to 
dissent against the government. 
  If the president forgets that he is, first, the president of 
all Paraguayans and becomes incomprehensibly intemperate, it 
will be very difficult to expect common sense and rationality 
from modest police agents who receive orders from their 
superiors. Their reaction is no accident, but a true response 
to the message they heard at the highest levels. 
  We cannot expect too much from those who must stand in the 
front line if those responsible for governing the country single 
out the press as being responsible for all wrong doings and 
then, when the social conflict explodes, travel to a cattle fair 
abroad. They only act within the context of the ideas and 
opinions being aired at the highest levels. So we must ask: 
Who, in fact, pulled the trigger?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Edwin Britez: "The Last Hope Dissolved"] </F>
  [Text] Judge Jose Agustin Fernandez' decision to dismiss 
charges against General Lino Cesar Oviedo for his alleged 
violation of the Electoral Code reminds us of the kind of 
country in which we live. From time to time it is necessary to 
come to earth and look at ourselves in a mirror so as not to 
forget that despite the passage of time we continue to live in a 
country that has not changed. 
  Perhaps this is Judge Jose Agustin Fernandez's only merit, 
if 
we need to find a positive side to the decision. Or perhaps it 
is Electoral Prosecutor Carlos Aranda Daroczi's merit to remind 
us the kind of country in which we live because instead of 
formally filing charges against Oviedo he simply handed the file 
on the alleged crime to the judge. 
  The fact is that Army Commander Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo is 
free to continue participating in politics for as long as he 
chooses. Neither his natural Armed Forces commanders nor the law 
or ordinary justice can stop him. The truth is that the judge 
was the last hope. 
  Of course, we could not expect the present Armed Forces 
commander in chief [President Juan Carlos Wasmosy], for whose 
candidacy Oviedo worked without pause during the electoral 
campaign, to order his retirement for breaking a law. Neither 
could we expect Gen. Oviedo to get scared and request his 
retirement because of Rambo [Hermes Rafael] Saguier's protests 
or the reports presented by [Liberal Party leaders] Domingo 
Laino or Bogado Gondra. 
  We would offend the intelligence of Gen. Oviedo if we 
thought 
he would authorize an eventual entry of U.S. troops into the 
country at a time there was a possibility of retiring him and 
when the only ones who could control him were those in "Strong 
Roads 94-South." 
  Now that we can no longer object to the Army commander on 
political, legal, and least of all military grounds, we must sit 
down and mentally design policies for the 1993-98 period, with a 
military leader as the central axis of the transition to 
democracy. 
  Our reality for the next four years, even though it might 
hurt to admit it, will be one of a civilian government under 
Armed Forces tutelage. The country's rudder will be operated 
from the barracks for as long as the state apparatus continues 
as it is today. That is why there is resistance to reforming 
the state, the privatization program, judicial branch changes, 
and the appointment of independent-minded officials. 
  The current situation favors the unofficial handling of 
public affairs because institutions operate based on political 
loyalties and because these political loyalties are nothing else 
than blind obedience to the individual in command, never fearing 
the law, and least of all support for reasonable government. 
  Prosecutor Carlos Aranda discovered a single possible 
electoral crime in the files. He handed the judge the evidence 
of an act at the Interior Ministry involving Oviedo and the 
then-Colorado Party presidential hopeful Juan Carlos Wasmosy and 
his running mate Angel Roberto Seifart. During this act, Oviedo 
said the ANR [National Republican Association-Colorado Party] 
and the Armed Forces would rule for ever. 
  Let us remind ourselves of some data from the archives 
regarding military interference in politics, just to make the 
prosecutor and the judge blush before their 
friends: 

  -  "Laymen Club charges that the military are 
interfering in politics." (ABC COLOR 6 Jul 92) 
  -  Former President 
Gen. Andres Rodrigues votes in the internal elections of the 
Colorado Party. Gen. Oviedo justifies military men voting in 
the internal elections of the Colorado Party. (ABC COLOR 14 Aug 
93) 
  -  Current Colorado Party President Eugenio Sanabria Cantero 
reveals that the ANR consulted Gen. Rodriguez, who in turn 
consulted the Armed Forces about the Wasmosy-Seifart ticket. 
(ABC COLOR 7 Sep 92) 
  -  "Former Colorado Party Presidential 
candidate Luis Maria Argana urges his fellow party members not 
to be afraid of the military men currently in power." (ABC COLOR 
25 Oct 92) 
  -  "Frutos [not further identified] criticizes the 
generals who support the Wasmosy-Seifart ticket." He mentions 
Generals Oviedo, Marino Gonzalez, and Rodriguez. (ABC COLOR 21 
Nov 92) 
  -  "Lino Oviedo again meddles in politics in Fuerte Olimpo. 
Military man participated in a political rally organized by 
Wasmosy and Seifart." (ABC COLOR 5 Dec 92) 
  -  "Colorado Party 
internal elections. Oviedo gives his opinion before polling 
concludes. `The people can lump it if they have the desire to 
return to the past,' he said referring to Argana after 
announcing that he had voted for the Wasmosy-Seifart ticket." 
(ABC COLOR 28 Dec 92) 
  -  "The military men who participated in the 
ANR rally may be punished." (ABC COLOR 5 Feb 93) 
  Finally, after ANR's victory was made known on election day, 
Oviedo, who was still euphoric, stated that his remarks at the 
Interior Ministry during the election campaign were not made to 
"lift the spirit and courage of the Colorados, because his voice 
and vote respond to only one person." 
  The last hope of a military caudillo who would bow before 
the 
law has now vanished with Judge Jose Agustin Fernandez' 
decision. We must now resign ourselves to putting up with a 
military chief as the focal point of the transition to democracy 
in the 1993-98 period, and at the same time observe how the 
pieces are moved in a plan that contemplates the immobility of 
the state's obsolete structure so that it can remain at the 
service of those who seek continuity. 
  The background data showing that the law has been violated 
is 
useless, the law itself is useless when those who administrate 
it think more about the bench they sit on than the justice that 
concerns us.

  [Text] Stockholm, 3 May (EFE) -- It was disclosed today 
that Peruvian Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg has stated that 
the little attention paid to the problem of terrorism is the 
best sign that Sweden has changed its opinion on Peru. 
  At the end of his two-day visit to Stockholm, heading a 
Peruvian commercial mission, Goldenberg signed an agreement for 
the mutual protection of investments with Swedish Foreign Trade 
Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel, who hopes the Swedish presence will 
increase in Peru. 
  Bilateral trade currently leans in Sweden's favor. In 1992, 
Sweden bought foodstuffs, fruit, vegetables, and textile 
products from Peru totalling $8.7 million and sold machinery, 
vehicles, engines, and optical equipment to Peru worth $40.5 
million. 
  Goldenberg also met with Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha 
af Ugglas and with some 100 Swedish businessmen to whom the 
Peruvian delegation explained the economic, political, and 
social stability Peru currently enjoys. 
  Goldenberg told EFE that Peru "experienced the greatest 
economic growth in the continent" during 1993, which amounted to 
7 percent, while the population grew by just 2 percent, adding 
that in 1994 "we expect 5 percent growth." 
  Legislator Carlos Montoya and engineer Arturo Woodman, who 
are part of the Peruvian delegation, lectured at the Stockholm 
University's Latin American Institute on the subject: Peru, an 
Emerging Economy. 
  The Peruvian delegation met with representatives of the 
largest Nordic bank, the Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank (SE-Banken) 
to whom they explained the privatization of the Peruvian banking 
sector. 
  Goldenberg told EFE that the Peruvian Government "in the 
next 
few months will continue its privatization project" which 
includes two large banks, two insurance companies, several 
mining companies, and several hotel chains. Goldenberg also 
mentioned the constitutional reform that will allow Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori to run for reelection for another 
five years, adding, "this will not be the only change." 
  Goldenberg said the Constitution, "drafted by a Constituent 
Assembly, is the only one" in Peruvian history to have been 
"ratified by a popular referendum." This has never happened 
with any of the previous Peruvian constitutions. 
  Regarding the possibility of Fujimori being reelected for 
another presidential term, Goldenberg stated that Peru is "a 
full democracy," and reelection "is a mere possibility" about 
which the president "has not even stated his intention." 
  Unlike on other occasions, the subject of terrorism was not 
raised during his visit to Sweden. Goldenberg asserted that the 
problem still exists and mentioned the successful arrest of 
"Shining Path" leader Abimael Guzman. "without the firing of a 
single shot." 
  The Peruvian minister did not dismiss the link between 
terrorists and drugs, although he reiterated that coca 
production and consumption in Peru is an "ancestral tradition" 
of the people who use it in a "quite different way" from that of 
modern society. 
  Goldenberg requested "concrete support from the 
international 
community" to implement alternative plans, but "the consumer 
countries have not seriously tackled" the problem. 
  The visit was free of any incidents, although diplomatic 
circles feared action by some of the 2,500 Peruvians residing in 
Sweden, which prompted the tightening of safety measures around 
the Peruvian visitors. 
  The delegation included Lima Stock Exchange Director Jose 
Luque Otero and representatives of the National Industries 
Association and of the Chamber of Commerce. They will also 
visit Italy, Switzerland, and Austria to inform European 
investors about the Peruvian economy. 
  The visit of the Peruvian commercial mission ended with a 
meeting with the Swedish Riksdag's (parliament) Foreign 
Commission. They left for Milan, the second phase of the tour, 
this afternoon.

  [Text] Lima, 4 May (EFE) -- Six retired Peruvian Army 
generals have been brought before the Military Court for 
statements or publications considered "offensive" to the Armed 
Forces or an "insult to their superiors." Today, the Military 
Court Supreme Council will hear the charges against Generals 
Jaime Salinas and German Parra, who criticized the performance 
of General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, Army commander and commander 
of the Armed Forces Joint Command. 
  For Gen. Parra alone, the military prosecutor has requested 
a 
sentence of eight months' imprisonment. Salinas and Parra 
maintain that their comments were personal and were made in 
their capacity as civilians now they are retired. 
  The Military Court has sentenced Gen. Luis Cisneros 
Vizquerra 
to 90 days' imprisonment "for insulting his superiors." 
Cisneros was interior minister under the military government 
that ruled between 1968 and 1980. 
  Gen. Alberto Arciniega, who presided over the court that 
sentenced Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman to life 
imprisonment, in January 1993 was charged with offense and 
insult. He sought refuge in the Argentine Embassy because of 
these charges and then travelled to that country. 
  Gen. Jose Pastor Vives has been charged with insulting his 
superiors, and was sentenced to a provisional sentence of 60 
days' imprisonment. Vives was involved in the thwarted coup of 
13 November 1992, but was pardoned later on. 
  The trial of Gen. Sinesio Jarama began on 2 May. He is 
charged with allegedly insulting the Army as an institution. 
  Gen. Salinas, who was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment 
for having headed the aborted 13 November coup, is also being 
tried for offending the Armed Forces and insulting his 
superiors. Gen. Parra, former transportation minister during 
former President Alan Garcia's government (1985-90), is charged 
with offenses and insults. 
  Several constitutional experts have stated that although the 
Constitution establishes some political restrictions for 
military officers on duty, it is not the same for those who are 
retired and are regarded as civilians. 
  Raul Ferrera, former dean of the Lima Law School, stated the 
application of the military code contradicts the Constitution, 
which guarantees the right to an opinion of every citizen, 
without distinction.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ernesto Perez Balladares, Panamanian presidential </F>
candidate of the United People alliance, marking the conclusion 
of his campaign for the 8 May presidential elections, at the 
Cinco de Mayo Plaza in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] Friends: I am very proud to be standing on this dais 
-- the same spot where so many times I was at the side of our 
leader, Omar Torrijos Herrera. Viva Omar Torrijos! [applause] 
  Oh, how many happy memories bring back to me this Cinco de 
Mayo Plaza. I can recall the rally for what represented the 
culmination of our generational struggle -- the Canal Treaties, 
as notorious people have labeled the treaties that we know as 
the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. [applause] 
  I want to tell the spirit of Torrijos, who is here with us, 
this: Those of us who picked up your flag are here; those who 
gave your Panamanian flag the kiss of dignity and those who will 
not rest until we have the free, independent, and sovereign 
country you dreamed of are here. [Crowd chants: "Toro, Toro, 
Toro"] 
  Friends: In 1990, we initiated a substantial reorganization 
of our political movement -- the political movement of Omar 
Torrijos. We have come a long way. We have brought our original 
concepts back to our party. We have regained the love and the 
affection of the Panamanian people. Now we solemnly swear never 
to betray the goals marked by Omar Torrijos Herrera. 
  The campaign has been one of proposals and decency. We have 
not and will not hurt any opponent. We will never hurt anyone. 
We have already forgiven those who have offended and insulted 
us. Let them not be worried: People who are united do not have 
time for foolish retributions. [applause] 
  We are going to be the best government the Republic has ever 
had, because we have a historic commitment and vision. We also 
have a commitment to the children and the young people of this 
country. We, for their sake, will create the best government in 
the history of the Republic. [Unidentified supporter shouts: 
"Viva Toro Balladares! Viva Panama! Viva Omar Torrijos!" 
Crowd responds: "Viva!"] 
  This will be a government with no hatred and no discord; a 
government that will not return to past models; a government in 
which all Panamanians will feel they have equal opportunities; a 
government under which there will be no first class, second 
class, or third class citizens; a government under which the 
children of all Panamanians -- whether black, white, or Indian 
-- will have equal opportunities. [Unidentified supporter 
shouts: "Viva the Panamanian women, the youth, the children!" 
Crowd chants: "Toro, Toro"] 
  We are going to have a government that will respect the 
rights of all groups; a government that will properly appreciate 
teachers, because they deserve not to be mistreated or despised; 
a government that will not use the tools of the transportation 
workers to harass them; and a government that will be committed 
to opening the doors of the 21st century the way we Panamanians 
want them open -- through the efforts of the people and the 
government working together. 
  Recently, there was an incident in which a Public Force 
officer dressed as a civilian pulled out a weapon. We do not 
know what his intentions were. Today, while standing here, I 
want to tell Juan Bautista Zapata this: Regardless of your 
intentions, my family and I have already forgiven you. There is 
no problem. [applause; crowd chants: "Toro, Toro, Toro"] 
  Not only will we forgive him morally and spiritually, but I 
will also ask my party to withdraw whatever charges or lawsuit 
it filed against citizen Zapata. [Unidentified supporter 
shouts: "Long live Toro Balladares! Long live the PRD!"] 
  This is the type of government we will truly have: not a 
government of false pledges, hatred, or a return to the past, 
and not a government of old commitments. Instead, we will have 
a government that is looking to the future and committed to our 
children. We will advance toward this goal --- all of us, 
united -- because people who are united... [pauses] [crowd 
shouts: "Will never be defeated!"] 
  We will all go, together, and recover for these people their 
health, reopening health centers that have been closed; again 
stocking those health centers with medicine; providing dignified 
education for our sons and daughters; and building true homes 
instead of the dismal rooms -- rooms that insulted the dignity 
of the people of Colon. Friends: In sum we will work together 
as a country to recover our Panamanian pride and dignity, which 
has been trampled on by this puppet government! [applause] 
  I also want to tell you that this is hardly a sample of the 
total number of votes the United People have decided to cast on 
Sunday. There is no doubt in any of the polls that we lead the 
next closest candidate not simply by 4, 5, or 6 percent, but by 
thousands of votes more than anyone else we will get! [Crowd 
shouts: "Long live United People!"] 
  Shortly after Sunday, shortly after Sunday [repeats himself] 
we will truly begin the real work -- in other words, working on 
specific proposals with our elected community representatives, 
with our elected mayors, and with our elected legislators, all 
of whom will comprise a team that on 1 September will not have 
to sit down and carry out a survey at the provincial level, 
because we will already have it. We only have to implement the 
measures, solutions, and proposals that we already know of! 
[Unidentified supporter shouts: "You can feel it! You can feel 
it!" Crowd responds: "President Toro!"] 
  It is a young team and a team into which we want to invite, 
as my teacher Omar Torrijos did, all Panamanians, but most of 
all, those who have the greatest ability, without asking their 
surname or even taking into consideration their political 
affiliation, because this is what the homeland demands at the 
end of the 20th century. 
  Friends: I am aware of the capacity of our party's 
followers, and I know you will not be forgotten or cast aside. 
On the contrary, you must be our government's backbone, and you 
will be because you are the memory of Omar Torrijos Herrera. 
[crowd chants: "Toro, Toro, Toro"] 
  But in order to do all of this we must first get past 
Sunday, 
8 May. I want you to accompany me and the vice presidents in 
spirit because at 0630 we will be in line to vote so no one gets 
the idea they can scuttle our decision. Our vote must be first; 
our vote must be early -- one more early morning wake-up call 
for the sake of Torrijos and for Panama to overwhelmingly win. 
[applause] 
  I cannot fail to mention something very important: Our 
United People alliance comprises three parties. Regardless of 
your party affiliation, make sure your vote is an alliance vote 
from top to bottom. [applause] 
  Friends: On Sunday a new era for the Republic of Panama 
begins, and the end of the era of this century begins. Our 
commitment begins with those who will replace us on 1 September 
1999, which we hope will be other Torrijos followers. They will 
find a united country, an independent, free, and sovereign 
country, with an outlook toward the future; a country which will 
work with its children for their children and grandchildren; and 
a country, my friends, where everyone without exception can feel 
proud and full of patriotism and may sing that stanza of the 
national anthem, which I invite you to sing along with me: We 
have at last reached victory in unity! 
  A united people will never be defeated. Many thanks, 
friends. Push ahead so that victory is ours.

  [Text] A CID/Gallup poll one week before the general 
elections reveals that at "the last minute" there has been a 
"dramatic change" favoring Ruben Blades, the Papa Egoro 
Movement's presidential candidate. 
  The CID/Gallup poll indicates that Blades would win the 
presidency in the event of a last-minute coalition between 
Christian Democratic Party candidate Eduardo Vallarino, 
Democratic Alliance candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, and 
Change '94 candidate Ruben Carles. 
  If Carles were presented as the candidate of such a 
coalition, he would gain 22 percent of the votes, Blades 33 
percent, and United People alliance candidate Ernesto Perez 
Balladares 30 percent. 
  If Moscoso de Gruber were the candidate of such a coalition, 
she would obtain 23 percent of the votes, Perez Balladares 30 
percent, and Blades 32 percent. 
  If Vallarino were the presidential candidate, he would 
obtain 
9 percent of the votes, the PRD's Perez Balladares would 
maintain his 30 percent, and Blades would get 38 percent. 
  This poll, prepared exclusively for EL PANAMA AMERICA by 
CID/Gallup, was taken between 24 and 29 April to determine the 
Panamanian people's political preferences in the upcoming 8 May 
elections. 
  For this poll, 1,200 citizens were interviewed in 60 
different parts of the Panama City metropolitan area, Aguadulce, 
El Roble, Anton, El Valle, Portobelo, Baru, Dolega, San Lorenzo, 
Los Santos, Guarare, Atalaya, and other districts. 
  The poll reveals that most of people prefer Ernesto Perez 
Balladares and Ruben Blades; they obtained a 30 percent and 26 
percent support rating, respectively. 
  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber obtained 17 percent, Ruben Carles 
14 
percent, Eduardo Vallarino 2 percent, Samuel Lewis Galindo 1 
percent, and Jose Salvador Munoz 1 percent. 
  The poll highlights the fact that Ruben Blades' rating 
increased 14 points, but the Papa Egoro Movement candidate has 
relatively little support in the interior of the country. 
  CID/Gallup found that while Blades and Papa Egoro have 
improved their positions in the past 60 days, Perez Balladares 
is suffering a decline. Nevertheless, the latter continues to 
have the majority of support among Panamanians. 
  Of the people polled, the PRD registered a 26 percent 
support 
rating, Papa Egoro 21 percent, Arnulfist Party 14 percent, 
Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] 9 percent, 
Christian Democratic Party 3 percent, and Morena [National 
Renewal Movement] 3 percent, while 20 percent of those polled 
did not express a preference. 
  Other relevant findings in the poll show that nine out of 
every 10 Panamanians will vote and that a similar proportion are 
against a return of military personnel to power. 
  Some 87 percent of Panamanians "do not want any kind of 
alliance with military personnel to govern Panama in the 
future." Ernesto Perez Balladares, according to the CID/Gallup 
poll, is the candidate who would favor a new military force. 
  If one of the presidential candidates withdrew from the 
race, 
CID/Gallup determined that Blades would attract 50 percent of 
Perez Balladares' followers, 30 percent of those backing Mireya 
Moscoso de Gruber, 44 percent of the ones endorsing Eduardo 
Vallarino, and 31 percent of those who support Carles. 
  Carles would receive support of 34 percent of those who back 
Mireya Moscoso, 25 percent of Blades' followers, and 17 percent 
of Vallarino's backers. 
  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber would receive the support of 35 
percent of Carles' supporters, 24 percent of those backing 
Samuel Lewis Galindo, 20 percent of the voters who support 
Vallarino, and 17 percent of the Papa Egoro supporters. 
  The poll revealed that 41 percent of the Panamanians polled 
believe unemployment is the main problem facing the nation. The 
issue is followed by corruption with 20 percent, and drug 
trafficking with 11 percent. 
  Guillermo Endara was viewed favorably in the CID/Gallup 
poll. 
Endara "is improving in the eyes of his people, and he has not 
been evaluated this favorably since March 1991," the polling 
firm observed. 
  The president improved 28 points in one month, and, 
according 
to CID/Gallup, the broadcast of the documentary on the civilist 
struggle "has a lot to do with the positive change in his favor."

<F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A discharge will be requested for the National 
Maritime Service [SMN] policeman who was arrested for carrying a 
weapon and pulling it out of its holster during the United 
People [UP] alliance's musical event. Corporal Juan Bautista 
Zapata of the SMN is being held at the Homicide Division of the 
Judicial Technical Police [PTJ] and will be handed over to the 
Electoral Court. 
  The authorities are trying to determine Zapata's criminal 
accountability. He was arrested by police after he pulled out a 
gun during a UP musical event as UP presidential candidate 
Ernesto Perez Balladares was stepping down from a dais. Zapata 
said he drew his gun because he thought he was going to be 
attacked. To the police, this is a violation of the law. 
  [Begin PTJ Director Oswaldo Fernandez recording] The mere 
fact that he was attending a political event not in uniform 
constitutes a serious charge under our disciplinary regulations, 
but it will be up to his superiors to make any final decision. 
[end recording] 
  According to Major Santiago Fundora, director general of the 
National Air Service, Zapata not only faces a criminal 
investigation, but disciplinary sanctions as well. 
  [Begin Fundora recording] We are prohibited from attending 
political meetings and caravans. Therefore, regardless of 
whether his situation is clarified, he will be sanctioned with 
dismissal. He will be sanctioned with dismissal, because we 
cannot permit uniformed members to take part in one or another 
manner in political activities. [end recording] 
  UP presidential candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares canceled 
a 
series of electoral campaign activities scheduled for today as a 
security precaution in light of the incident that occurred 
yesterday on Balboa Avenue during the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] youth festival, when the SMN member was 
arrested with a gun. The PRD, whose presidential candidate is 
Perez Balladares, will close its electoral campaign tomorrow 
with an event at the 5 May Plaza.

  [Text] University of Panama business administration 
students closed the Transisthmian Highway for one hour today 
causing traffic congestion on adjacent roads. The student 
leaders reported that Arnulfist Party members threatened them 
with firearms because they had blocked the road. From 1030 to 
1145 [1530-1645 GMT] students closed the Transisthmian Highway 
to demand the inclusion of certain subjects in their curriculum. 
  [Begin unidentified student recording] We have taken to the 
street to protest a series of measures, the administration has 
taken against the students. Registration has been closed, there 
is no [words indistinct], we have no security at night, there 
are no lights, there is no air conditioning, and we need desks 
and classrooms. These are problems that the faculty is not 
resolving. [end recording] 
  The student leaders reported that three men and a woman in a 
green Mazda with license number 133088, displaying Arnulfista 
Party propaganda in support of Legislator Lucas Zarak, took out 
weapons and threatened the students if they did not allow them 
through. 
  [Begin unidentified student recording] Occupants of a car 
with propaganda flags and posters supporting Mr. Lucas Zarak of 
the Arnulfist Party pulled guns on us and told us they were 
going to go through anyway, and they threatened all of the 
students, even the girls. If it had not been for Public Force 
units, they would have fired their guns and wounded students. 
[end recording] 
  Several minutes later, Public Force units asked the students 
to end the roadblock, and after the university under secretary 
arrived, the students ended the roadblock.

    [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 19 April 
1994 reports on page 10 Sandinist National Liberation Front 
(FSLN) economist Alejandro Martinez Cuenca says in a commentary 
that compensation of former owners is the key to resolving the 
property issue. To this end, Martinez calls on the government 
"to act immediately to guarantee that more than 600-million 
cordobas paid out as bonds to former property owners retain 
their value." He suggests that the use of compensation bonds be 
expanded to include transactions taking place at state-owned 
banks, the customs office, and the income tax directorate. Bonds 
should also be used to complete the acquisition of shares for 
properties privatized by the National Corporation of the Public 
Sector begun in 1990. Martinez says that the government "should 
not delay taking action to guarantee the value of the 
compensation bonds."

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "180 Minutes of News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The extraordinary Council of Ministers meeting 
approved guidelines for the decree establishing taxes on bank 
debits which is scheduled to enter into effect on 9 May. The 
announcement was made by acting Finance Minister Luis Javier 
Grisanti who explained that the tax will be levied on all 
operations carried out by individuals or legal entities at the 
country's financial institutions. 
  The banks will act as withholding agents and will notify the 
financial authorities of the total amount collected, one day 
following the collection date. According to the decree, the 
states, municipalities, Central Bank of Venezuela [BCV], 
investment funds, the National Savings and Loans Bank, the 
autonomous and academic institutions, and foundations are 
exempted from paying the tax since these organizations are 
considered state institutions. Exempt operations also include 
those related to BCV's legal reserve accounts, operations 
between PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum] and the BCV, and those 
related to financial intermediation in mortgage banks as well as 
savings and loans banks. 
  Likewise, exemptions include all transfers related to a same 
account holder within the same bank institution, or between his 
deposit and his liquid asset funds. Diplomatic missions, 
consular and international organizations, and the personnel 
assigned to these offices are also exempt from paying the tax. 
  [Begin Grisanti recording] Article 13 of the decree law 
establishes a very important guideline whereby in those cases of 
bank accounts opened for payroll purposes, employers will not be 
allowed to transfer to the workers amounts paid as a result of 
the tax. In other words, anytime the payroll account is debited 
by the total wages to be paid to the employees, it has been 
clearly determined that the employer will deduct the 
corresponding amount. Of course, debits caused by the account 
holder after having received payment will be taxed. [end 
recording] 
  The acting finance minister stressed that because of the 
provisional nature of the tax, payment will not entail a 
decrease in the taxes to be paid the following year by taxpayers.

  [Text] The Central Bank of Venezuela has announced it will 
auction dollars starting on Wednesday to meet the high demand in 
the foreign exchange market. According to a communique from the 
bank, the measure is aimed at proportionately distributing among 
agents the amount of dollars at a carefully calculated average 
price. 
  The announcement also specifies that the amount of U.S. 
currency requested by agents must not exceed 10 percent of the 
amount sold the previous day. Banks and other operators may sell 
this foreign currency to the public for a profit that must not 
exceed the amount of 20 cents above the original purchase price. 
  Although the demand for dollars continued on Tuesday at a 
frenetic pace, the comparative level of the foreign currency's 
current price decreased. In fact, the dollar's price closed at 
128.50 bolivares in the banks and at 129.50 in the foreign 
exchange houses. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Venezuela 
continued to supply foreign currency to enable financial 
organizations to meet public demand. 
  According to business groups, the increase in the dollar's 
price will be reflected in product prices over the next few 
months. According to the Jose Bouza Izquierdo, chairman of the 
National Banking Council, citizens should not get nervous and 
make purchases that encourage an increase in the dollar's 
exchange rate, because the exchange market situation is 
beginning to stabilize.

  [Text] The historic global conference on Sustainable 
Development of Small Island Developing States [SIDS] continues 
to be plagued with controversy. One of the environmental groups, 
Greenpeace, currently attending the conference, says the SIDS 
conference is not addressing important environmental issues. 
Anna Toney, head of the Greenpeace delegation now in Barbados, 
spoke with Michelle Arthur about this matter. 
  [Begin recording] [Arthur] According to Miss Toney, the 
[word 
indistinct] conference is not adequately dealing with 
environmental issues. She says the real conference promises were 
made to host the conference on sustainable development [words 
indistinct], but what is happening is Barbados is another talk 
shop. 
  [Toney] Two years later, we come here to Barbados, and yet 
again a lot of rhetoric, and I really do believe that there be 
threats of environment [words indistinct] development are so big 
that they can no longer wait, so [words indistinct] action plan 
do germinate some of the issues with very much concern such as 
climate change, such as [word indistinct] (bleaching), fisheries 
and others. We really hope the developed countries will try to 
give in much more on the international side of the action plan 
because it is all very well to tell the small developing states 
what they should be doing at home when you know that they do not 
really have to contribute too much for the environmental 
problems they are now facing [as heard]. 
  [Arthur] The Greenpeace delegate is also concerned about the 
amount of paper and plastic materials used at the UN conference. 
She said the number of press releases and plastic cups and 
plates being used should be reduced. Greenpeace also plans to 
meet with the Barbados fishing community within the next few 
days. Miss Toney says there are many common problems facing the 
fishing communities all over the world. The Greenpeace ship is 
now docked in Barbados. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Without disclosing how many Salvadoran troops will 
be involved in the U.S. Army exercises dubbed Fuertes Caminos 
II, [Defense Minister] General Humberto Corado confirmed that 
they will participate. The defense minister also said that a 
considerable amount of the mechanical equipment used in the 
military exercises, which begin this month, will remain in the 
country after the exercises conclude on 20 August. 
Nevertheless, said the ranking military officer, the importance 
of the exercises is the work experience that our troops will 
gain. 
  [Begin Corado recording] Certain pieces of equipment will 
remain in the country, and some will be kept by the U.S. Army 
because they are quite expensive and can be used for joint 
exercises in other Latin American countries. However, we will 
have gained experience from working with highly skilled military 
engineers. As you can see, the projects completed during the 
first phase are of very good quality. In my opinion, the most 
valuable part of this experience lies in the knowledge our 
soldiers will gain from working with U.S. engineers. [end 
recording] 
  Gen. Corado explained that the Army's new organic law will 
broadly reconcile the role of the Armed Forces with the spirit 
of the Constitution. He said the internal readjustment process 
is growing increasingly positive. 
  [Begin Corado recording] I have been informed that [words 
indistinct] have been sent to the Supreme Court of Justice. As 
I already told the president of the Republic, we will adhere to 
any court decision that opposes the continuation of these joint 
exercises between the U.S. Army and the Salvadoran Armed Forces. 
However, as long as a resolution to that end is not issued, we 
will continue the operation until 20 August when the second 
phase ends. [end recording] 
  The defense minister argued, among other things, that the 
unconstitutionality appeal filed last year with the Supreme 
Court of Justice, which opposes the presence of U.S. troops in 
the country, is not hindering the military exercises. 
Nevertheless, if the Supreme Court decision favors the appeal, 
the exercises will be suspended within the framework of respect 
for the Constitution. For the time being, however, the 
exercises in El Salvador will continue, Corado said.

  [Excerpt] Tandil, 4 May (NA) -- In this city today 
President Carlos Menem presided over the ceremony commemorating 
the 12th anniversary of the Air Force's baptism by fire in the 
South Atlantic conflict, and once again harshly criticized 
"those who want to create a confrontation between the public and 
the Armed Forces." 
  In an impromptu news conference that he gave at the end of 
the ceremony, Menem emphasized that "certain interests" are 
trying to create a confrontation between the military and 
civilians. 
  He also insisted on stressing that "we have never had better 
relations with the United States" and said he believes that 
country will not apply sanctions if the pharmaceutical patents 
law is not approved. 
  In this respect he stressed that a measure of that kind 
"would not be suitable either for the United States or for 
Argentina." 
  In addition, the chief of state again criticized the mothers 
of Plaza de Mayo, saying: "I respect them about as much as they 
respect the president of the nation," and immediately asking: 
"Who is financing the many trips they make?" 
  Menem presided over the Air Force ceremony, which was held 
at 
the 6th Air Brigade based in this city, together with Army Chief 
of Staff General Martin Balza. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The PPS [People's Socialist Party] yesterday 
decided to support the candidacy of PT [Workers Party] leader 
Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. 
  The party made the decision during a convention held over 
the 
weekend in Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais). 
  The convention was attended by 74 of the 117 delegates with 
the right to vote. Of the 74, 69 voted in favor of the alliance. 
  There were four votes against, while one delegate abstained 
(he did not vote either for or against). 
  PPS Secretary General Francisco Almeida, 54, said the party 
will work to expand the front that supports Lula and 
"progressive parties." 
  The PPS does not want the campaign and Lula's program of 
government to become radical. 
  "We want a broad debate on the program. We will begin with 
the PT program, but it must be open to change, because new 
sectors should join in for the run-off election," he said. 
  The PPS will deliver its proposals to the PT in 15 days. 
  Of the PT factions, the PPS supports the one led by Sao 
Paulo 
Deputy Jose Genoino. 
  Almeida has said that the differences between the PPS and 
the 
PT "are not insurmountable." [passage omitted]

all appropriate investigations are under way and everything will

and we will respect their decision.

I think this will teach us to be a bit more mature. I never 
shut the doors to dialogue. I have always been open to 
dialogue. I will continue to wait for them to approach us. 
This is the best way to reach an agreement. You are all aware 
of the results of force. 
  [Reporter] Will the government convene a new meeting with 
workers to negotiate? 
  [Wasmosy] Of course. The government has repeatedly made that 
call. The negotiating table is open. 
  [Reporter] Do you think the result of the strike was 
negative? 
  [Wasmosy] You have already commented on the strike enough 
through the press. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Aristides Cajar Paez] </F>
  [Text] According to the latest poll conducted by the 
consulting firm of Dichter &amp; Neira/Louis Harris, presidential 
candidates Ernesto Perez Balladares and Ruben Blades are in 
first and second place, respectively, in electoral preferences. 
  Presidential candidate Perez Balladares of the United People 
Alliance ticket, ranks first with 33.3 percent. According to 
the same poll, presidential candidate Blades of the Papa Egoro 
Movement trails Perez Balladares with 24 percent while candidate 
Mireya de Gruber of the Arnulfist Party ranks third with 17.3 
percent. Meanwhile, presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles of 
the Change '94 Alliance ticket dropped to fourth place with 16.8 
percent of the electoral support. 
  Meanwhile, Mayin Correa, candidate for mayor of the 
municipality of Panama, obtained 44 percent of the electoral 
support among those polled in Panama City, followed by radio 
commentator Andres Vega Domplin with 26.7 percent, and first 
lady Ana Mae Diaz de Endara, who is in third place with 8 
percent. 
  This poll was conducted with the methodology of simulated 
vote-casting [votacion simulada] applied to a random sample of 
5,479 eligible voters chosen among the group that is most likely 
to vote nationwide. These subjects used ballots similar to the 
ones that will be used on the 8 May presidential and mayoral 
elections. 
  The nationwide poll was conducted by province between 30 
April and 3 May 1994. In order to guarantee the accuracy of the 
information, a pilot poll was implemented on 29 April. This 
poll was carried out in the homes of persons who interviewed 
face to face with the pollsters, and had an estimated 3-percent 
margin of error. 
  In addition to electoral preferences for president, this 
poll 
measured people's sympathy toward candidates for mayor in the 
municipalities of Panama and San Miguelito, and the political 
parties nominating the various candidates for these positions. 
  Perez Balladares received the highest support rating in 
Panama Province -- 35.3 percent of those polled, and 31.1 
percent in the rest of the country. Subjects ranging from ages 
30 to 39 (36.3 percent) make up his support base. 
  Meanwhile, Blades received support from 28.5 percent of 
those 
polled in Panama Province vis-a-vis 19 percent in the rest of 
the country. The age group backing Blades' presidential 
candidacy is that made up of 18 through 29 year-olds (33 
percent). 
  On 2 May, Blades concluded his electoral campaign with a 
concert staged outside the Rommel Fernandez Arena in Juan Diaz, 
while Perez Balladares will conclude his campaign today with a 
rally scheduled for this afternoon in the 5 May Plaza. 
  Mireya Gruber, who publicly expressed her dislike for 
electoral polls, will conclude her campaign activities on 6 May,

  [Text] On 3 May, during an unusual news conference that 
linked him with reporters in several parts of the world, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton upheld his position of not varying on the 
U.S. policy toward Cuba. In response to a question by a Cuban 
television journalist, Clinton reiterated his support of the 
Torricelli Law and stressed that he does not expect any change 
in that policy for now. 
  President Clinton, who has been labeled as indecisive, at 
another point in the news conference, acknowledged that the 
United States is incapable of solving the problems of the world 
and [words indistinct] only when U.S. vital interests are 
endangered. 
  Regarding Haiti, Clinton warned that he has not dismissed 
the 
use of force and insisted that the DPRK must allow full 
inspection of its nuclear program. However, he was less 
aggressive regarding Bosnia when he affirmed that Washington's 
goal continues to be a negotiated peace.

  [Text] U.S. President William Clinton gave a detailed 
explanation of the priorities of U.S. foreign policy during a 
journalists forum organized with CNN in Atlanta, Georgia. In 
this regard, Clinton talked about current areas of tension such 
as Bosnia, Rwanda, and Haiti. He also talked about the 
elections held in South Africa, among other topics. As for 
Haiti, Clinton said that Washington does not exclude the 
possibility of military intervention based on the facts that 
this Caribbean country is a separate case and that there is a 
need to stop the killings and restore democracy. 
  Clinton spoke in favor of not lifting sanctions on Serbia 
until the negotiations for a peaceful solution in Bosnia begin. 
As for Bosnia, Clinton announced new interventions by NATO 
planes if the Bosnian-Serb forces attack UN-protected territory. 
  The head of the White House saluted the agreement signed on 
Wednesday between the PLO and Israel and praised the results of 
the elections in South Africa saying it opens up the possibility 
of contributing to this country's development, which could be 
the key to the African continent because of its capability, 
according to Clinton. 
  As for Cuba, William Clinton reiterated his support for the 
trade and economic blockade of the island. Regarding the ties 
with the PRC in the last two decades, he said that Washington 
will work hard to iron out the differences between the two 
nations.

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betacourt; from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin arrived in 
Havana on an official visit today, immediately beginning talks 
with her counterpart and host, Roberto Robaina Gonzalez. When 
she arrived in the Cuban capital, Mrs. Sanin de Rubio spoke to 
Cuban and foreign journalists about the objectives of her visit 
and the outlook for bilateral relations. 
  [Begin recording] [Sanin] Since the reestablishment of 
relations, we have sought to obtain in-depth knowledge of our 
mutual circumstances. Therefore, we are going to address 
bilateral topics, exchange opinions and information on our 
respective countries, and review the bilateral agenda on 
commercial, cultural, and educational topics. There might also 
be an opportunity to talk with important Cuban personalities. I 
want to obtain in-depth knowledge of the reforms undertaken by 
Cuba in economic and political areas, because we all have great 
hopes that current problems will be overcome and there will be a 
greater opening at different levels as a result of Cuba's 
achievements and the reforms that have begun, based on Cuba's 
self-determination. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What are the most immediate trade 
prospects between the two countries? 
  [Sanin] Well, our overall trade amounts to $12 million. 
There are great opportunities. Colombian businessmen will be 
paying a visit. I am interested in speaking with the Cuban 
authorities about some points which are important to promoting 
greater Colombian investment in Cuba and improving trade. This 
brings development and opportunities. Many of our products can 
have a market here and many of your products can have a market 
in Colombia. I think we have to review certain conditions, such 
as the possibility of signing an agreement on investment 
protection. I also want to review with the Cuban authorities 
the possibilities for foreign investments. 
  [Reporter] Does Colombia uphold its decision to sell 
petroleum to Cuba? 
  [Sanin] Colombia will sell petroleum to Cuba without any 
problem as long as Cuba can pay within the terms and conditions 
Colombia establishes for the sale of oil. If you can accept the 
Colombian terms, we see no problem in selling it. The letter of 
credit and the terms are being discussed. 
  [Reporter] In your view, are relations with Cuba going well? 
  [Sanin] They are going well because they are developing with 
mutual respect for domestic affairs and with a great sense of 
cooperation and understanding. There is interest in all sectors 
of the two countries. 
  [Reporter] How much petroleum is being negotiated? 
  [Sanin] I do not have that exact information because the 
quantity would be established based on the terms and conditions. 
  [Reporter] What priorities or topics does Colombia, as 
host, have for the fourth [Ibero-American] summit? 
  [Sanin] Economic topics as a basis for political reforms and 
their sustainability, because economic and political reforms 
cannot be carried out without emphasizing social aspects. In 
addition to the extreme poverty of a large part of our 
population, Latin America's great problem is the inequalities in 
our societies. We are going to review the opportunities that 
integration provides for economic development and prosperity for 
our peoples, but always based on in-depth social reforms. 
  [Reporter] Will your visit lead to a possible visit by 
President Gaviria before (?the end of his presidential term)? 
  [Sanin] It is not scheduled. The president's agenda is 
already quite heavy. We had not [words indistinct] but in any 
case we will hold the Ibero-American summit in Cartagena and we 
will receive President Fidel Castro on 14 and 15 (?July). 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] expect an agreement? 
  [Sanin] The transaction is being carried out like two normal 
countries. There is talk of prices, duration, and guarantees. 
The duration is being discussed. You are asking for a longer 
duration than what Colombia is willing to offer and you are 
offering a guarantee different from the one we are accustomed to 
receiving. Nevertheless, it is a normal discussion in commercial 
terms. We want it to be a normal commercial operation and we 
are discussing it. Therefore, if we reach agreement, there is a 
sale, and if not, it will be like so many other commercial 
operations that are not carried through. It would not mean 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] [Passage indistinct] 
  [Sanin] That is what we want, that it be a step in the 
strengthening of relations, a sign of cooperation and mutual 
respect, and of my country's desire to learn up close about the 
reforms under way in Cuba. Everyone knows that Cuba is 
experiencing various difficulties, but we are very hopeful about 
the political resolve and President Fidel Castro's statements 
yesterday about this being the beginning and that you are 
willing to establish [words indistinct] reforms to resolve the 
island's problems. We have great hope that these measures will 
be effective. We respect that the reforms will stem from Cuba's 
self-determination and we hope that the political resolve that 
has been expressed will be clear and real. We all want the 
Cuban people to be prosperous, enjoy well-being, and be able to 
maintain the reforms the country has achieved in social aspects 
such as education, health, and other fields. [end recording] 
  The program for the Colombian foreign minister's 24-hour 
visit to Cuba includes meetings with Carlos Lage, vice president 
of the Councils of State and Ministers, and a working luncheon 
with Army General Raul Castro. In addition, she will visit the 
National Library and the Casa de las Americas to deliver 
donations of books and crafts. Along with the Cuban foreign 
minister, she will confirm the work program of the joint 
intergovernmental commission that was recently created and will 
sign an educational agreement. Before leaving Cuba, Mrs. Sanin 
de Rubio will hold a news conference.

has reiterated his government's respect for Colombia's 
self-determination, affirming that he does not interfere in 
Colombian internal affairs and saying that he does not support 
any guerrilla activities. 
  Early this morning, President Castro spoke for four hours 
with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio who arrived in Cuba 
on an official visit. Castro said that trade relations with 
Colombia are at their best level, adding: Our foreign minister 
reiterated that President Cesar Gaviria's government is willing 
to sell Cuba the oil it needs, as long as negotiations meet the 
demands of Colombian oil authorities. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, who accompanied 
Colombian Foreign Minister Sanin de Rubio, emphasized the 
changes made in Cuba's economy and said that the government will 
encourage the necessary changes, as long as they respect its 
autonomy, which, he said, is not negotiable.

  [Text] Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio this 
afternoon will conclude her visit to Cuba at the invitation of 
her Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina. Yesterday, Sanin met 
with Commander in Chief Fidel Castro. Reporter Roberto Cavada 
held a conversation about this with the Colombian foreign 
minister. 
  [Begin recording] [Cavada] In remarks to Radio Rebelde, Mrs. 
Sanin de Rubio referred to her meeting yesterday with President 
Fidel Castro. 
  [Sanin] It was very interesting, profound, and direct. We 
discussed many world, regional, and bilateral matters, as well 
as the set of problems affecting most countries, especially the 
most common of all, poverty. The meeting with Fidel was simply 
marvelous. 
  [Cavada] Did President Fidel Castro send a message to 
[Colombian] President Gaviria? 
  [Sanin] Only the regular greetings, and satisfaction over 
the 
development of relations between the two countries, in a most 
dynamic way, and in different areas. We had a very, very 
interesting and profound chat on political and economic matters. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Did he explain the changes taking 
place in Cuba? You have expressed great interest in learning 
about the changes ... 
  [Sanin, interrupting] He obviously explained the measures 
being adopted and the policies that are going to be developed. 
We had a very broad conversation. At 0200 in the morning we were 
still talking. 
  [Cavada] Could I say then that you are very satisfied with 
this visit to Havana? 
  [Sanin] Yes. We have fulfilled all our objectives. We are 
now 
closer, have gotten to know each other better, and have 
exchanged opinions. This visit was satisfactory from all points 
of view. 
  [Cavada] Thank you very much. [end recording] 
  The Colombian foreign minister at this moment is talking 
with 
Defense Minister Raul Castro, following a meeting with Cuban 
Vice President Carlos Lage.

<F P=106> [Interview with Broad Front presidential candidate and </F>
Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vazquez by unidentified BUSQUEDA 
reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [BUSQUEDA] You have said that the electoral 
"options" in November will be "between neoliberalism and 
democracy." What did you mean by that? 
  [Vazquez] A society can be individualist or collectivist. 
The 
first centers on a person's ego, and so society inevitably 
becomes egoistic. The other alternative seeks the common good 
for present and future generations. I think that is the key to 
the matter. The neoliberal concept points to an individualist 
society, with free competition, where "the best" wins. If we all 
participated on equal terms I could, perhaps if not accept it, 
at least analyze it. But not everyone starts from the same 
point. Some people start with an advantage and arrive first. 
This is tremendously unfair. Besides, individualist societies 
can lead to the concentration of wealth and power in the hands 
of very few individuals, who end up controlling the rest of the 
population. This system considerably weakens democracy. In this 
system the people do not govern. They are governed by a group of 
individuals who have concentrated strength, power, and wealth. 
This group has power and force because it has wealth. This is 
not democratic, and it materializes as a consequence of the 
neoliberal concept. On the contrary, societies working with a 
democratic, collectivist, socialist spirit tend to be a model 
like the one we have tried to implement in Montevideo, where we 
have tried to decentralize power, seek people's participation, 
and redistribute wealth to deepen democracy. This is why we 
think we will see a confrontation of two sets of ideas. On the 
one hand there are the liberal or neoliberal ideas--whatever you 
want to call it, it is the same thing--and on the other 
progressive, socialist ideas. That is the center of the 
confrontation. I do not think there are other options. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Who are the "socialists" and who the 
"neoliberals?" 
  [Vazquez] I do not want to characterize Uruguayans as good 
or 
bad. Some of us simply think in one way, and others in a 
different way. In the National Party the Herreraist faction, 
other related movements, and Gonzalo Aguirre all point to a 
neoliberal idea. I do not know what Carlos Julio Pereyra would 
do in government. All I know is that he has participated in the 
government with the ruling party, and has supported liberal or 
neoliberal ideas. The Colorado Party as a whole has neoliberal 
principles. All Colorado Party factions support neoliberal 
principles. Pacheco Areco, Jorge Battle, and Luis Maria 
Sanguinetti do so. 
  [BUSQUEDA] In your opinion, then, a vote for either the 
National Party or the Colorado Party suggests a vote for 
"neoliberalism," while the Broad Front alone supports 
"socialist" ideas? 
  [Vazquez] Yes, although it is not only the Broad Front that 
believes in alternatives to the neoliberal system. Many 
progressive groups within the National Party, the Christian 
Democratic Party, the Civic Union, and the PGP [Party of 
Government by the People], which do not want to join in a 
coalition with the Colorado Party, also have alternative ideas. 
[passage omitted] 
  [BUSQUEDA] Why do you think Cerro Largo Mayor Rodolfo Nin 
Novoa is the best candidate for becoming your running mate? 
  [Vazquez] I do not know if he is the best candidate, but 
from 
the point of view of an alliance, he has extremely important 
credentials. He was Cerro Largo's mayor during the previous 
period, and was reelected. There must be a reason. He could have 
chosen between the Cerro Largo city hall and a seat in the 
Senate. He chose to continue in a very difficult position, in a 
very poor department, with very few resources. This shows that 
he is a very serious politician. He also worked against the 
impunity law. Then he worked against the imposition of the state 
enterprises law, and on very important municipal issues. He 
defended the deregulation of services and functions, political 
decentralization, and people's participation. He has maintained 
really progressive ideas within his party, adopting clear 
positions. He recently said that he was willing to resign from 
the National Party if necessary to defend his political 
position. This is extremely serious and consistent. Nin Novoa's 
political behavior moves in a clearly defined direction, which 
must be respected. For all these reasons I think he is an 
excellent candidate for becoming part of a presidential ticket. 
  [BUSQUEDA] What will be the main issues in the campaign? 
  [Vazquez] We think the numbers have to add up, the accounts 
have to balance, but our ultimate objective is not balanced 
accounts but an improvement in people's standards of living. All 
issues that have something to do with human beings will be given 
priority. For instance, the issue of social security. There is 
no social security without solidarity. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Do you think the current social security system 
must be reformed? Or should it be left the way it is now? 
  [Vazquez] I think we have to improve the system, not destroy 
it. We must improve the system's administration and the 
collection and distribution of funds. But all improvements must 
be done without changing the state role, and insisting on each 
employee's work history. 
  [BUSQUEDA] How would you face the fight against inflation? 
  [Vazquez] The current government reduced the country's 
inflation rate, but we want to reduce it faster. At what cost 
and how is another matter, but inflation dropped. We also want a 
fiscal balance, such as that we achieved in the municipality. 
This shows that efficiency and the good handling of figures can 
also be achieved by groups that are not liberal or neoliberal. 
The difference is that progressive groups seek to benefit man. 
Figures are not the final objective. Now if you ask me what will 
be more important, or whether I will support and seek loans for 
bankrupt financial institutions and banks, the answer is no. 
That will not prevail in any way. 
  [BUSQUEDA] The state has more than 250,000 employees. Would 
you implement programs aimed at reducing the number of public 
employees? 
  [Vazquez] The number of public employees during my municipal 
administration dropped from 13,000 to 10,500. That was all right 
because there were too many employees. But I cannot give you an 
answer now about what we will do if we win the presidential 
race. If the situation in the national administration is similar 
to the situation we found at the Montevideo city hall, we will 
make adjustments. In Montevideo we had a significant number of 
administrative personnel and few people rendering services to 
the people, which is what the public needs. We spent more money 
in the area of services than in any other area. Perhaps the 
problem is similar at the national level. But we will see about 
that later. 
  [BUSQUEDA] How would you face the issue of privatization if 
you become president? 
  [Vazquez] Without prejudices. Private initiative can also 
generate jobs. If it is correctly handled it can also 
redistribute wealth. Private initiative is not a dirty word. We 
can say the same thing about "entrepreneurs" or "enterprises." 
  [BUSQUEDA] Will you speed up the devaluation of our currency 
if you become president? 
  [Vazquez] From our point of view it is clear that our 
currency is overvalued, and there is a clear increase in the 
import of luxurious items. This is the result of the free market 
concept. These kinds of policies inevitably end up benefiting a 
small group of people. This group handles large amounts of 
capital and treats Uruguay as if it were just a financial 
market. This path is not best for the public. On the other hand, 
it is true that inflation punishes most harshly the poorest 
sectors, and particularly those with fixed incomes. I think the 
goal is to reduce the inflation rate. We must change the concept 
that the country is just a financial market. We must produce and 
export more. Trade must be balanced, or it must show a surplus. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Yet exporters contend that as the dollar is 
cheap, 
their activity is not cost effective. If you are elected 
president, do you think you will have to implement some measures 
in the exchange system? 
  [Vazquez] In the exchange system, and in the country's 
system 
as well, because inflation is not the result of only one factor. 
At one time this administration argued that inflation stemmed 
from a fiscal imbalance. It therefore undertook a fiscal 
adjustment to roll down inflation. The fiscal adjustment had 
some measure of success, but inflation did not go down as much 
as expected. The administration resorted to other measures that 
were in obvious alignment with laissez-faire ideas. I think we 
have to seek a meeting of minds if we are to curb 
inflation--which weighs more heavily on precisely the 
neediest--through a different economic, political, and social 
concept. This cannot be achieved overnight, and the steps to be 
taken will be gradual. We are not proposing a radical change in 
policy, but rather a gradual one, trying to keep inflation under 
control but changing into a producer country through a major 
industrial retooling. 
  [BUSQUEDA] You said in Rivera last December that wealth 
ought 
to be "taxed" and redistributed. Are you considering 
establishing new taxes or increasing those that are already in 
effect? 
  [Vazquez] Tax policy should be changed, for example on 
landholding of unproductive large estates, or on those used for 
extensive rather than intensive agriculture. Taxes should be 
levied on the financial sector, and the country's production 
should be fostered by easing the tax burden on productive 
activities. Wealth should be taxed so that those who have more 
may pay more, changing the distribution of taxes. This change 
may allow us, for example, to reduce the VAT [value added tax]. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Will you encourage the elimination of bank 
confidentiality if you gain the presidency? 
  [Vazquez] Bank secrecy in Uruguay has led some international 
sectors to the opinion that Uruguay is a stronghold for the 
laundering of drug money. If Congress does enact such 
legislation, and the judiciary gives its okay, I believe that it 
would be quite appropriate to do away with bank confidentiality 
in some cases. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Referring to you and to the Broad Front's 
problems, Luis Eduardo Gonzalez, a sociologist, said in an 
article published in the MIAMI HERALD: "We have a jockey who is 
a real pro, but the problem is the horse." What is your opinion 
on this remark? 
  [Vazquez] The Broad Front is neither the pinnacle nor the 
ideal as a political party, but it is making much headway. The 
Broad Front has had internal problems, but over the last few 
months it has shown very significant coherence. First, it 
elected provisional authorities who are also empowered with 
significant decisionmaking power. Second, it proposed that the 
decisions of the second Broad Front Congress--held in August 
1991--concerning political alliances be firmly pursued. 
Third--and this is something that would have been unimaginable 
seven or eight months ago--it has been able to draft a framework 
program dealing with crucial issues such as the external debt, 
relations with the Armed Forces and the police, and the 
country's economic and financial policy. We will be able to use 
this program as a basis for our discussions with other political 
parties. Moreover, it has nominated its consensus candidates.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Katin] </F>
  [Text] Army Chief General Humberto Ortega will leave the 
military ranks and hand over his command on 21 February 1995, a 
source close to the presidential palace confirmed to BARRICADA. 
  Gen. Ortega's retirement was agreed on yesterday during a 
"top-level closed-door meeting" held at the Olof Palme 
Convention Center under tight security. Attending the meeting 
were members of the Executive Branch, the National Assembly 
Blocs Assembly, and the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] General 
Staff. 
  Among those attending were Presidency Minister Antonio 
Lacayo, Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta, National Assembly 
Representatives Luis Humberto Guzman, Sergio Ramirez, Frank 
Duarte, and Ivan Salvador Madriz. Also present were Gen. Ortega 
and the EPS top command. 
  Our source told this newspaper that President Violeta 
Barrios 
de Chamorro will announce the decision on an unspecified date. 
It is believed this could be on 2 September, during the Army 
Day celebration. 
  One of the participants of the meeting told BARRICADA that 
the points the Executive Branch brought to the fore were related 
to the Military Organization Code, the deadline for Gen. 
Ortega's retirement, and the situation of terror that exists in 
the country's northern region. That highly reliable source said 
Gen. Ortega seemed at ease when talking of his departure, "which 
will take place on 21 February 1995." 
  President Chamorro will announce Gen. Ortega's retirement 
and 
the name of his replacement, once the National Assembly approves 
the Military Code. "Chamorro may make the announcement on 2 
September during the Armed Forces anniversary, the source said. 
On that same date, President Chamorro announced Gen. Ortega 
would step down in 1994, prompting a violent reaction by the 
EPS, which was taken by surprise. 
  When asked by BARRICADA, Gen. Ortega said the topic of the 
Army had been discussed "very superficially" during the meeting, 
downplaying the importance of the matter. "These were general 
topics, first to work out final aspects of the law we have 
drafted and which will be in the Assembly in a few days. 
Second, we discussed the conflict in the north," the EPS chief 
stated. "The idea is to submit the bill for the consideration of 
the National Assembly so we can have a law based on a consensus 
between state branches within a sensible period of time," he 
added. 
  Deputies Roberto Urroz and Adolfo Jarquin of the Nicaraguan 
Democratic Movement and Social Democratic Party, respectively, 
felt this is positive solution to the existing problem. When 
commenting on the matter, Urroz said a source of tension will be 
eliminated and "once Ortega's replacement is announced, he will 
be the one to take over the reigns of the EPS."

  [Text] Caracas, 3 May (AFP) -- AFP correspondents have 
reported the Bomb Squad the Political Police [as received] 
(Disip) [Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services] 
and agents of the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) today at 1600 
(2000 GMT) defused a small bomb some 50 meters away from the AFP 
office in Caracas. 
  A police source told AFP the explosive device was planted 
inside a briefcase full of blank sheets of paper left in a 
building located on Urdaneta Ave. The officer added: "We have 
not ruled out that this is an action similar to the one that 
occurred in the Caracas subway on 2 May." 
  On the morning of 2 May, a homemade bomb exploded in a 
Caracas subway car, wounding five people. An unknown group, the 
Popular Liberation Front Urban Command [Comando Urbano del 
Frente de Liberacion Nacional], claimed responsibility for the 
attack. 
  In the early afternoon of 2 May, the Political Police 
reported it had identified two minors as the suspected 
perpetrators of the Caracas subway attack. The Attorney 
General's Office will prosecute their cases. 
  Anonymous calls to the PTJ on 3 May reported the planting of 
explosive devices in at least four places in Caracas.

  [Text] The Uruguayan Government has convened an 
extraordinary session of the OAS Permanent Council tomorrow to 
discuss possible military intervention in Haiti by the United 
States. This information was confirmed by Foreign Minister 
Sergio Abreu who, commenting on another issue, underlined that 
Uruguay has not adopted any unilateral position concerning the 
common external tariff. 
  During a briefing before the Senate International Affairs 
Committee this afternoon, Abreu pointed out that Uruguay's aim 
in convening an extraordinary session of the OAS Permanent 
Council is to find the means to prevent a unilateral decision 
that may affect the principle of nonintervention and harmonious 
relations in the hemisphere. 
  With regard to Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the 
foreign minister stressed that neither negotiations nor the work 
of task forces with other member countries have been suspended. 
He noted that all negotiations, whether with NAFTA or the EC, 
will be undertaken as a group. 
  Commenting on the situation in Haiti, Abreu said: 
  [Begin recording] [Abreu] Well, in view of the announcement 
made by the U.S. President concerning a possible military 
intervention in Haiti, the Uruguayan Government has decided to 
convene an extraordinary session of the OAS Permanent Council to 
exchange ideas on this situation, and perform what we consider 
an act of preventive diplomacy, i.e. to seek the necessary means 
and instruments to stave off a unilateral intervention that may 
affect the principle of nonintervention and the harmonious 
functioning of hemispheric relations. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Have you already discussed this 
issue 
with lawmakers? 
  [Abreu] Exactly, we have informed the International 
Relations 
Committee about this, in the first place, as it is not only an 
issue of prime importance but also pertains to the country's 
foreign policy. And above all there is the need to seek a 
dialogue that will enable parties to abide by the Governor's 
Island agreement on Haiti and to prevent unilateral measures 
that may affect what we believe is a principle that must be 
respected in a clear way and with no restrictions. 
  [Reporter] What conclusions have you derived from your 
meetings? 
  [Abreu] Well, we have discussed the Haitian issue with the 
Bolivian foreign minister, who presides over the ad hoc group. 
He entirely shares our views. We understand that this issue 
must be assessed [words indistinct] so that it can then be 
submitted to the OAS General Assembly, which will be held in 
Belem, Para State, Brazil, at the end of the month. We have 
also had a telephone conversation with the Brazilian foreign 
minister, who is at present in France, and with the Chilean 
foreign minister. We were all of one mind regarding our concern 
about and interest in warding off unilateral intervention. We 
therefore agreed to discuss this issue at the appropriate forum, 
which is the OAS, and above all to start working with a view to 
devising a solution which, I repeat, combines the interests of 
democracy and also full respect for the principle of 
nonintervention. 
  [Reporter] Did you discuss the Mercosur issue with 
lawmakers? 
  [Abreu] Yes, we have made it clear -- and it is very 
important for the press to record this -- that there is 
absolutely no unilateral proposal on the part of Uruguay 
concerning the common external tariff. We have not suspended 
negotiations, and Uruguay has not withdrawn from the task force. 
[end recording] 
  These were the remarks made by Foreign Minister Sergio 
Abreu.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel Castro to the First International </F>
Small Island Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, in 
Bridgetown, Barbados, on 5 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Mr. President, Your Excellencies: 
  The powerful are discussing the outlines of the new 
partition 
of the world. Poor and small countries are trying to figure out 
how we are going to survive in the upcoming decades. Since we 
are islands barely a few meters above sea level, we ask 
ourselves: What will happen when the water level rises? Will we 
be able to withstand the droughts, hurricanes, and other weather 
disasters awaiting us? 
  It is more than an issue of our cultural and human wealth; 
what is at stake is our very lives, our existence as nations. We 
are not responsible for this. Others colonized and exploited us. 
Consumer societies destroyed the environment; annihilated 
millions of plant and animal species; poisoned the seas, rivers, 
and lakes; polluted the air; saturated the atmosphere with 
carbon dioxide [as heard] and other noxious gases; tore apart 
the ozone layer; depleted oil, coal, natural gas, and solid 
mineral deposits of enormous wealth; cut down our forests, and 
ruined theirs. 
  What is our inheritance? Underdevelopment, poverty, 
dependency, backwardness, debt, and uncertainty. What are they 
talking to us about now? About sustainable development. Great. 
We believe in that. To that we aspire. However, is such 
development possible with immensely wealthy societies that can 
survive only on the basis of continuous growth and only at the 
expense of exhausting natural resources? 
  What do they need more wealth for? While Switzerland has a 
net per capita income of $34,000; Bangladesh, with over 100 
million people, and threatened with being swallowed by the sea, 
has a per capita income of only $210. The chasm between the rich 
and the poor grows larger everyday. Is this contrast the absurd, 
irrational example given to the peoples of the Third World? 
  The arms race continues. The weapons trade is on the 
increase. The most powerful nations sell the most weapons; they 
do not mind profiting from the death of others. Why should they 
care about the environment and the fact that islands are sinking 
underwater? To highly developed societies, the problem is not 
one of growth, but of distribution; not only of distribution 
among themselves, but distribution among all. The so much 
discussed sustainable development is impossible without a more 
equitable distribution among all nations. There cannot be 
sustainable development for a part of the world, and 
underdevelopment for the rest. Whether they like or not, mankind 
is today one large family and we will all meet the same fate. 
  Let deceitful words be used less, and let there be a change 
in philosophy since such a selfish philosophy has yielded only 
the catastrophes we endure today, and the worse ones we will 
endure tomorrow. 
  Let us hoist above our islands the banners of truth. The 
poorer and smaller we are, the more firm and courageous our 
words should be. Let us not resign ourselves to the sad role of 
those Roman gladiators who bid goodbye to their masters with the 
well-known, sad phrase: Farewell Caesar, those about to die 
salute you. 
  We ought rather to tell them: We will die if necessary, but 
not as slaves. We will die proclaiming that we will fight for 
our futures, that we will fight for our truth, and that our 
people, children, and grandchildren also have a right to live. 
Thank you very much. [applause]

  [Text] There cannot be sustainable development for a part 
of the world, and underdevelopment for the rest. This was said 
by Cuban President Fidel Castro on 5 May at the First 
International Small Island Nations Conference. In his address to 
the plenum of the summit, comprising approximately 50 
delegations in Barbados, Fidel pointed out that the problem of 
sustainable development will not be solved unless there is a 
more equitable distribution of the world's wealth. 
  Fidel added: We are islands a few meters above sea level. We 
ask ourselves what will happen when the water level rises, and 
whether we will be able to withstand the droughts, hurricanes, 
and other weather disasters awaiting us. Fidel also pointed out: 
We are not responsible for this; others colonized and exploited 
us. Consumer societies have destroyed the environment. 
  Commander in chief Fidel Castro today emphasized that while 
annual per capita income of Switzerland is $34,000; Bangladesh, 
with over 100 million habitants, and in danger of disappearing 
underwater, has a per capita income of barely $210. Castro said 
this during the 5 May session of the First International Small 
Island Nations Conference being held in Bridgetown, Barbados. 
  Castro added that the arms race continues, weapons sales are 
on the increase, the most powerful nations sell the most 
weapons, and do not mind profiting from the deaths of others. 
Why should they care about the environment and the fact that 
islands are sinking underwater? 
  All the heads of state and government present in Barbados 
are 
participating in today's meeting; they are scheduled, on 6 May, 
to approve a program for action on sustainable development for 
small island nations.

  [Text] Barbados Foreign Minister Branford Taitt stated to 
PRENSA LATINA that the presence of Cuban President Fidel Castro 
at the First International Small Island [Nations] Conference has 
greatly contributed to defining the objectives and strategies of 
the conference. 
  Following a brief meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto 
Robaina, Taitt said he had been excited to learn that Fidel 
Castro was to attend the Bridgetown conference. Taitt pointed 
out that Fidel Castro's address to the plenum was brilliant, and 
that he personally believes Castro's presence lends greater 
importance to the conference and contributes to defining 
fundamental elements in the strategies of sustainable 
development of the small island nations. 
  Taitt added that the process of integrating Cuba into the 
Caribbean Community's economic mechanisms would not suffer 
delays due to external pressures.

<F P=106> [By special correspondent to Barbados Gisela Bel Heredia] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina also held bilateral meetings with members of the 
delegations from Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, 
Barbados, and Guyana; and in all cases, the support of Cuba and 
the rejection of the blockade have prevailed. Likewise, the 
delegates conveyed positive expressions of support to Cuba's 
entry into the Association of Caribbean States. 
  At the conclusion of the first day of work by the 
highest-level members of the conference delegations, the path to 
the Declaration of Barbados and the action plan has been paved. 
These documents will be approved at the closing of the 
conference's debates. 
  The need to defend our natural resources and to establish 
policies to enhance the environment, and the quest for ways that 
lead to the survival of the small insular states are the main 
prevailing proposals in this conference. 
  According to the agenda, the first Global Conference on 
Sustainable Development will conclude tomorrow. This conference 
has been going on in the capital of Barbados since 25 April. 
Over the past two days, several chiefs of states and of 
governments have joined experts and active members of various 
organizations participating in this conference.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>
  [Text] Responding to a question asked by a Cuban reporter, 
President Clinton reiterated variations of an aged anti-Cuban 
policy of the Cold War. On the Global Forum program, which 
according to reports was viewed by more than 200 million people 
in different parts of the world, including the United States of 
course, Clinton backed the Torricelli Law and said that Cuba 
should assume the model of democracy that is pleasing to 
Washington, so that the United States can modify its policy 
toward our country. Up to a certain point his desire to secure 
the electoral votes of the State of Florida for his aspirations 
to be reelected as president weighs on White House decisions 
regarding Cuba. 
  Despite the previous points, which are a variation of the 
same issue, certain tones were observed in Clinton's answer to 
reporter Taladrid, of Cuban television. I believe that, despite 
all the boring anti-Cuba rhetoric that in fact violates 
principles of international rights, the UN Charter, and the 
reformed agreements of the General Accord on Tariffs and Trade, 
the anti-Cuba policy of the current U.S. Administration is not 
identical to that of the Republican decade. 
  Maybe, during his second and last term, Clinton will listen 
to the demands of important sectors from political, industrial, 
trade, and intellectual circles within the United States and 
decide to modify the conservative and outdated aspects of his 
predecessors' anti-Cuba policy. But the fact remains that today, 
taking into account the aforementioned tones, that the policy of 
imperial hegemony remains in force.

  [Text] Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin concluded an 
official and intense visit to Cuba, which included with a 
meeting with Cuban President Fidel Castro. Sanin described the 
meeting as frank, profound, and enriching for increased mutual 
understanding. 
  [Sanin] "President Fidel Castro's appearance was the same as 
always, because I have always seen him as dynamic, energetic, 
and in perfect health. We also had a long conversation and I 
believe that after we finished, he went on to other matters. 
Therefore, his health is perfect. I bear a message of friendship 
from President Castro to President Gaviria, which was the same 
message I delivered, as two countries that have full diplomatic 
relations." 
  During the news conference Minister Sanin responded to 
questions referring to the sale of Colombian oil to Cuba. 
  [Sanin] "This is merely a commercial issue, and it is being 
treated in that manner by Colombia and Cuba. We are discussing 
methods of payment, guarantees, and the time period." 
  Noemi Sanin spoke to reporters about her visit to Cuba 
during 
the news conference. 
  [Sanin] "It has been a very successful visit because we have 
completed the entire agenda. We have exchanged opinions, and we 
reviewed our new relations because it has only been seven months 
since they were reestablished. Nevertheless, we must stress that 
the relations are dynamic." 
  Minister Sanin also met with Revolutionary Armed Forces 
Minister Army General Raul Castro; Carlos Lage, vice president 
of Council State; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government; and other governmental 
officials. Foreign Ministers Sanin and Robaina signed an 
agreement in the area of education that standardizes higher 
education diplomas and titles. Furthermore, they exchanged the 
instruments of ratification for the cultural cooperation 
agreement signed in 1978 between the two nations. 
  Early, this morning, Sanin inaugurated the Colombian Hall at 
the National Library, which received a large donation of books 
on different topics. At the inauguration of the display, Sanin 
said: We want Cubans to get to know us better. She also took 
advantage of the opportunity to announce the creation of chairs 
on Cuba in several Colombian universities. 
  Noemi Sanin also visited the House of the Americas, which 
received a donation of Colombian art. During a meeting she held 
there with Cuban writers and artists, she recognized Cuba's 
achievements in the cultural and educational fields and called 
for greater bilateral exchanges in those spheres. 
  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin departed for Caracas 
earlier this evening, where she will participate in a summit 
between the presidents of Venezuela and Colombia.

  [Text] The two main parties that comprise the government 
coalition in Chile advocate official plans to increase ties of 
cooperation with Cuba. Gutenberg Martinez, president of the 
Christian Democratic Party, asserted that his organization has a 
positive view toward any effort that could signify solidarity 
with the Cuban people. 
  Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona expressed his 
belief that the upcoming Ibero-American Summit represents a good 
opportunity for Chile to substantiate its plan of cooperation 
with Cuba.

  [Text] Today, the newspaper GRANMA printed Decree-Law No. 
149 on the confiscation of goods and assets obtained through 
illegal enrichment. The document reflects the decision adopted 
by the Cuban parliament in response to demands by the majority 
of our people, charging the Council of State with adopting 
effective and exemplary measures against those who obtain 
illegal possessions as a result of theft, speculation, 
embezzlement, black market activities, or other forms of 
enrichment that negatively affect the most vital interests of 
our society. 
  The decree-law provides for the confiscation and 
expropriation by the Cuban State, without any right of 
indemnification, of goods and assets obtained by people who 
directly or through third parties illegally increase their 
possessions in amounts beyond their normal income. 
  The minister of finance will impose, through a resolution, 
the sanction of confiscation of goods and income in cases to 
which Decree-Law No. 149 refers. The Republic's attorney general 
will have the authority and legal faculties necessary to conduct 
investigations, and to substantiate procedures of confiscation, 
acting on his own initiative by virtue of any information 
obtained. 
  The confiscation process will be directed against property 
owners, holders, or bearers of goods and assets, including those 
of third parties who benefited from them and who fictitiously 
appear as their owners. The attorney general's office, according 
to the results of the preliminary investigations, through a 
resolution, can retain the goods and assets of the person 
affected, and take any precautionary measures necessary to 
guarantee the fulfillment of the law. 
  The attorney general's office will also determine any 
actions 
required by public officials, employees of any entity, or by 
administrative or public officials to substantiate the case, and 
to implement any preventative measures that it may determine. 
These actions must be executed within a specific period of time. 
  According to the decree-law, once the attorney general's 
office adopts the necessary preventative measures on goods and 
assets, he will immediately call for legal proceedings in which 
those actions must be substantiated, and where those affected 
can present documents to justify the legitimacy of possession of 
those goods. According to the result of the proceedings, the 
attorney general's office will adopt one of the following 
actions: 
  Prepare the preventative measures that correspond to the 
goods and assets in case of not having already done so, and in 
that case, to ratify or modify the established measures or to 
annul them; 
  Pigeonhole the case file and annul the preventative 
measures, 
granting the return of goods and assets to their legal 
titleholders and owners; 
  Present the records with the confiscatory claim to the 
minister of finance and begin penal proceedings independent of 
the confiscatory action, if the investigation determines the 
existence of a crime. 
  Decree-Law No. 149 establishes that its implementation will 
be retroactive, given social interest, public use, and national 
needs. All acts carried out in an attempt to cover up the 
illegal character of an acquisition of goods or assets to which 
the document refers, and all actions carried out to avoid its 
application are annulled and lose all judicial value. 
  The Council of Ministers is in charge of dictating 
regulation 
of the decree-law. All laws, decree-laws, decrees, and other 
legal dispositions that oppose the fulfillment of this 
Decree-Law No. 149 are abolished. Decree-Law No. 149 will become 
enforceable from the moment of its publication in the official 
gazette of the Republic of Cuba.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Luis Sexto from BOHEMIA </F>
magazine and guest Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE 
newspaper -- live] 
  [Text] [Sexto] The decree-law on confiscation of ill-gotten 
goods has just been promulgated. In other words, the crusade 
against the hoarders has just begun. 
  [Rodriguez] I did not like that bit about crusade because 
that might give the impression of a campaign, something here 
today and perhaps gone tomorrow. I seems to me that this is 
precisely an act of national defense, wholly unrelated to a 
crusade or campaign. 
  [Sexto] Then, do you believe the hoarders could reappear? Do 
you not believe that when the hoarders are crushed, and 
conditions are created so they do not reappear, this might have 
been a crusade, something we can file away in history as a gray 
period, a file on a social germ which arose before our noses and 
we rejected? 
  [Rodriguez] When a farmer cuts down weeds, he does so hoping 
they will never grow again. However, during the next planting 
cycle, he has to do it all over again. He has to weed the crops. 
  [Sexto] I believe that what has happened is that the 
hoarders 
have been allowed to flourish alone for too long because we 
lacked this legal tool made public today. 
  [Rodriguez] We can all remember that there was a program 
against hoarders. However, our legislation only allowed for 
crime that was proven and therefore, today's decree-law on 
confiscation of ill-gotten goods is a new tool because this is 
also a new phenomenon. 
  [Sexto] I used the term crusade in a semantic manner. The 
crusades of history were temporary, provisional processes; there 
was an initial boom that later faded away. Crusade has always 
been understood as the impetus of a certain campaign, action 
against specific phenomena, which later diminishes. What I mean 
is that Cuba, with this decree-law conducted as an act of 
national defense -- obviously, our society... 
  [Rodriguez, interrupting] Excuse me, but let us replace 
crusade with: we are defending the nation even more. 
  [Sexto] We are defending the nation even more. In other 
words, our country is confronting very powerful, strong, dire 
circumstances and hardships. Cuba needs above all to cleanse 
itself, to eliminate obstacles and roadblocks. Evidently, the 
proliferation, particularly during this time of crisis, of 
harmful, immoral, illegal elements was weighing down our people 
even further. It is one more element of deterioration and 
demobilization. 
  [Rodriguez] Not only that, they are corrupt and corrupting 
elements. 
  [Sexto] Corruptors and demobilizers. To date, there has been 
a certain impunity against [words indistinct] profiteering. 
  [Rodriguez] In addition, they promote crime. 
  [Sexto] I am not saying that that impunity was the result of 
laziness, carelessness, or indifference. I believe that under 
these dire circumstances, the nation has had to fight on many 
fronts. Therefore, in these periods of crisis, of shortages, 
these periods when self-confidence can be momentarily lost, it 
is logical for these manifestations of vice to proliferate and 
even increase because then the society is a medium for this to 
happen. I believe we are now reacting decisively, firmly, and 
physically. 
  [Rodriguez] Although we have semantic differences, in 
general 
we fully agree. I believe that the decree-law on confiscation of 
ill-gotten goods is today applauded by the great majority of the 
people. 
  Of course, those affected will never be able to applaud it. 
It is applauded above all because it responds to the clamor of 
the people. Recently, we spoke of the [words indistinct] and 
mentioned how far the workers' [words indistinct] reaches. This 
demonstrates that the Cuban Government does listen to its 
people, its workers; and acts on the basis of what the masses 
entrust it with. Therefore, the people do rule here. 
  [Sexto] That clamor was very natural because despite the 
difficulties the Cuban people confront today, despite the 
difficulties that relax or stretch morals and values because we 
are even under survival conditions -- and morals have a certain 
relativity, are not absolute, fixed; they move according to 
prevailing material conditions in human societies -- anyhow, 
that clamor is logical because despite the fact that our people 
have great ethical reserves, our people are sickened by 
injustice, reject being exploited. We have not been resisting 
exploitation for so many years on a whim. We have been defending 
independence and social justice. This is precisely why I feel 
this is deep within the Cuban national character. 
  [Rodriguez] There is also a practical consideration 
regarding 
the confiscation of ill-gotten goods. The people are concerned 
with how we are going to identify the hoarders. I think that we 
have to collectively participate in denouncing those who will 
quietly try to evade the law. 
  I believe that in the neighborhoods, it is very hard not to 
know who those people are, those people who accumulate goods 
illicitly; who live above the means of his neighbors; and in 
addition, who sneer at the community around them; corrupt the 
community around them; have a group of collaborators; and I have 
been told -- although I have yet to see this -- that some even 
have bodyguards, in addition to many cars, and a lavish 
lifestyle. 
  [Sexto] I do not think that it will be difficult to identify 
them because ostentation and vanity are inherent in this type of 
vice. Those who make money easily are given to vanity, luxury, 
ostentation; and I believe these are the marks each one of these 
hoarders leave on the rest of society. In other words, the 
product of their ostentation and vanity. 
  I want to [words indistinct] it seems to me because one 
speaks with people, people call, write. I believe we have to be 
careful in identifying the hoarders. In other words, our people 
have a high concept of justice, but that justice has at times 
deviated toward egalitarian stands which are unfair per se. I 
believe it is good to stress that this decree is aimed at those 
who have profited illicitly. We cannot put in the same category 
workers who having given their intelligence, hard work, 
brilliance, and talents, have attained a higher standard of 
living because they have had many sources of income, salaries 
that are the product of honest work. We have to be careful with 
this. Here we are always going to refer to those who have 
profited by exploiting the needs of others. This is what we have 
to reject, condemn, and repress. 
  [Rodriguez] I believe this warning you issue is very good 
because it has been said many times that hoarders are all those 
who have amounts of money and live above the means of the rest 
of the people. However, we have to acknowledge that there are 
people who have attained that money honestly. This decree-law 
very well specifies illicitly gotten goods because those 
attained through legitimate means -- for example, inheritances 
-- we have to point out that there are still families in Cuba 
who inherited money from their relatives from the capitalist era 
and are still living among us. Perhaps, they live in a large 
house, have a vehicle and a life-style well above that of the 
average people, but we cannot condemn them for having inherited 
that, or having obtained it through legitimate means. 
  [Sexto] Of course, no one in Cuba is, nor can be against 
people having what their work allows them to attain. In other 
words, if I am very intelligent and hard-working, no one can 
reproach me for my higher income or lifestyle, over those who 
are not equally intelligent of hard-working. I am personalizing 
this. I am not that intelligent, nor that hard-working. This is 
clear. The listeners understand that. I am giving an example on 
a personal level. 
  We have to be careful. In our society, work is the first 
duty 
of the citizen. It has to be a means for the citizen to hope for 
a better life as an individual. No one can condemn or reject 
this, nor harass anyone who is better off as result of his work. 
  [Rodriguez] We also have to discuss a concern that numerous 
listeners and JUVENTUD REBELDE readers have expressed regarding 
the emergence of new legitimate hoarders on the basis of 
self-employment because self-employment work yields fairly high 
dividends in certain highly demanded sectors. I believe this 
concern of the people ought to be the focus of that group of 
measures begin taken today by the Cuban Government because it is 
an issue to everyone, according to their work, but excesses are 
not good either. I believe that self- employed workers ought to 
pay adjusted taxes according to their income. This will avoid 
the appearance of excessive wealth because these people also do 
not report practically anything to the people. I am referring to 
the hoarders, the ones [words indistinct]. 
  [Sexto] Self-employment today in Cuba is as legitimate as 
collective, state, or social work. I also believe it is fair for 
these workers to pay an adjusted tax on their income. This is an 
effort to balance out the differences. Now, we have to remember 
that many of today's high prices are the result of the excess 
currency in circulation. In the same measure that the excess 
circulation diminishes, the prices will logically drop because 
the excess circulation affects every transaction in Cuba. 
  [Rodriguez] Also, in the same measure that the presence of 
products increases, a competitiveness will take place and 
self-employed workers who today make perhaps tens of thousands 
of pesos in a year, will not make such excessive amounts. 
  [Sexto] Of course, because all these exorbitant incomes 
correspond to economic conditions supporting them. However, this 
is temporary. In the measure to wh ich we overcome this 
situation, these prices will find their corresponding balance. 
  [Rodriguez] In addition to this, in the measure that the 
offering of products and services improves in the state stores 
and facilities, this will increase competition and lower the 
prices and participation of self-employed workers in production.

<F P=106> [Speech by Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez to the </F>
National Assembly of the People's Government at the Havana 
Convention Center on 1 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro; Comrade Ricardo 
Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [ANPP]; comrade deputies; and guests. 
  When we began the discussions of the problems related to the 
internal financial imbalance in our country during the last ANPP 
session in December 1993, we all knew that we were facing one of 
the most serious economic, political, and social problems the 
Revolution has ever faced throughout its history. However, our 
people have grown accustomed to these hardships and have 
demonstrated, since our fights for liberty, that there are no 
obstacles or difficulties that cannot be overcome if one acts 
with resolution, patriotism, and loyalty to principles. 
  Today we have come to this special ANPP session, in 
recognition of 1 May, supported by a massive discussion -- an 
example of the people's participation in decision-making, which 
allows us to count on the collective thinking of the grassroots 
and on their understanding of the solutions to these red hot 
problems. 
  Before beginning the debates, allow me to submit some 
principles, which in our opinion, must precede solutions to the 
internal financial imbalances. To do this, we will submit the 
ideas prepared by the Ministry of Finance, and the opinions on 
which we must meditate and work. These opinions stem from the 
workers' parliaments and from the opinions gathered from the 
Cuban Communist Party [PCC] cadres and partisans; and in 
general, from the opinions [words indistinct] by all our people. 
  First of all, we must stress the fact that the best 
technical 
solutions will be feasible only if we can also count on the 
patriotism and honor of our fellow citizens and on their 
willingness to do whatever might be necessary to save the 
Revolution. 
  These solutions also claim that the principles of social 
justice and solidairty must prevail. In our country, no one will 
be neglected. No honest worker will see his essential interests 
overlooked or sacrificed, and no neoliberal adjustment policy 
will be implemented in Cuba. 
  Moreover, we must realistically assume that the measures we 
might adopt will demand an undeniable share of sacrifice, which 
we must face with the wisdom of he who is the defender of the 
essential things that guarantee our economic stability and the 
Revolution's survival. 
  The current financial imbalance in the Cuban economy 
synthesizes an imbalance that for years has been growing in the 
areas of production and distribution. It is appropriate to 
recall that this phenomenon is found both in the monetary area, 
through excess currency; and in the fiscal area, through the 
deficit in the state budget. 
  The solution to this imbalance is found -- as repeated 
several times -- essentially and ultimately -- in an increase in 
supply of goods and services, stemming from an increase in 
production. 
  However, due to the impossibility of achieving this growth 
to 
the extent demanded in a short term, we must reduce the demand; 
we must quickly revalue the national currency to motivate work; 
and finally, we must achieve an increase in production and 
services. 
  The initial basis of a fiscal streamlining policy has 
already 
been adopted, with substantial reductions to the 1994 budget 
deficit, to which I will refer later. 
  We must also take into account the fact that monetary 
circulation in the country at this moment includes both national 
currency and freely-convertible currency. Both must be 
considered when analyzing these problems. 
  In terms of national currency, by the end of March 1994, the 
excess currency amounted to 11.636 billion pesos. Of this total, 
59 percent was deposited in savings accounts with the People's 
Savings Bank, and 41 percent was circulating among the 
population. Over the first two or three months of the year, this 
amount of currency in the hands of the people has been 
increasing, and if the necessary measures are not adopted to 
curtail this trend, we will reach a much higher figure by the 
end of the year. 
  The primary income source of our population shows that, 
according to the latest available estimates, 44 percent of 
workers earned basic salaries of up to 148 pesos monthly, while 
32 percent earned between 149 and 198 pesos. Moreover, pensions 
were set between 60 and 99 pesos for 62 percent of all 
pensioners. In general, also according to the latest available 
data, families considered low income represented approximately 
24 percent of the total number of families throughout the 
country. 
  This situation calls for income distribution with certain 
modification levels. Considering the existence of a previous 
redistribution process and the existence of a certain amount of 
freely-convertible currency which, since the decriminalization 
of the dollar last year, has been having an impact on, but not 
essentially changing, many of these realities. 
  Considering the adoption of measures to streamline the 
country's monetary-fiscal system in accordance with the analysis 
we have made at the Finance Ministry, and which we are 
submitting for consideration by the ANPP today, we believe that 
the monetary-fiscal process must also be closely related to the 
reestablishment of other policies, which are being adjusted in 
the country in the labor and salary areas. 
  In the entrepreneurial area, for the sake of achieving the 
greatest economic efficiency and production growth possible, we 
have followed the recommendations of the workers' parliaments 
where these problems were discussed. 
  Moreover, the streamlining of the monetary-fiscal system 
demands the adoption of a set of consistent measures, the 
overall effect of which must be clearly established. Thus, the 
order, the discipline, and the pace of implementation of the 
agreed-upon measures will yield gradual effects, which will be 
perceptible within a period of at least 18 months. 
  The measures adopted therefore demand a great deal of 
political authenticity and feeling so as to achieve the greatest 
support possible from all of our population at this moment. 
  Let us now talk about the measures we have been analyzing 
throughout this discussion process. First of all, the measures 
adopted to reduce the budget deficit represent an essential 
element in assessing the country's financial situation. We can 
therefore state that for the 1994 budget, our government has 
decided to reduce that fiscal deficit by approximately 1 billion 
pesos during the current year. According to the estimates that 
have not yet been concluded, this represents a 24-percent 
reduction of that deficit. As we also reported during the 
session held in December, the reduction of subsidies for losses 
also plays an important role because in the 1994 budget, losses 
amounted to 1.3 billion pesos. For this reason, we are seeking 
efficiency and productivity efforts by our entrepreneurial 
institutions. 
  Also, among the overall financial problems, and in light of 
the discussions of these issues in December, the amount of 
accounts receivable and payable in the country were mentioned. 
At that moment we provided the data for a representative sample 
of companies and institutions, which were samples of others up 
to the end of the sessions on 30 September. 
  We were later able to complete the data from the information 
provided by each central state administration organization and 
by the local ANPP organizations, reaching the end of last year 
with accounts receivable totaling 3,898,800,000 pesos, 97 
percent of which belong to the entrepreneurial sector. 
  These accounts were divided in the following manner: 41 
percent were due in 30 days, a payment period which can be 
considered normal; 28 percent fell due between 31 and 90 days; 
while 31 percent fell due after more than 90 days. As a general 
rule, the accounts to be paid in more than 30 days represented 
only 12.4 percent of the overall value of sales during the year 
to date. 
  An analysis made by the majority, not to say all the state 
companies and the local ANPP organizations, has led to a 
reduction of these bills during the first quarter of the year by 
11.3 percent, which represents the collection of 440 million 
pesos which were pending as of 31 December last year. 
  Moreover, accounts receivable in freely-convertible currency 
[words indistinct] have reached a surplus of approximately 
209,800,000 pesos. However, of this total, 47.5 percent is the 
result of operations in currency among national institutions, 
and only 52.5 percent was the net total to be paid by companies 
abroad. 
  Moreover, from this total, which can represent a net flow of 
the country's income, 73.9 percent were in a normal payable 
situation, and only 26.1 were in an unpayable situation. Thus, 
after these analyses we can say that it has been confirmed that 
there is no negligence in charging the debts in freely 
convertible currency and that the pending debts are part of 
normal situations in the country's income. 
  Lastly, taking into account the situation of accounts 
receivable and accounts payable, the problems analyzed for each 
organization, and with the purpose of preventing current 
problems and situations in the detected cases from being 
repeated, a set of measures has been adopted to guarantee an 
improvement of the situation and to see that such an 
accumulation of accounts receivable is not repeated in the 
future. These measures are already in the process of being 
implemented. 
  Concerning measures to encourage savings, a few minutes ago 
we said that approximately 59 percent of the excess currency in 
the country is deposited in savings accounts. Thus, it is 
essential to consider the measures to be adopted to see that 
that money remains in the banks. We have considered several 
alternatives, taking into account our current economic situation 
and being careful not to imitate formulas that in other cases 
would yield some results, but which in our particular situation, 
might not be the most suitable. 
  Thus, we have thought that a set of options could be 
considered, options which are not always or necessarily related 
to the increase in interest rates, because with the excess 
currency in the country, it is not always the case that an 
increase in interest rates would necessarily increase the 
motivation for savings. We must look for other alternatives. 
These other alternatives contemplate the possibility of relating 
savings accounts to specific ends, as some have mentioned here 
and in the workers' parliaments themselves, which might imply a 
freezing of funds for a given time with guarantees given by the 
bank for the saver, so that these funds can be converted into 
some type of special savings bonds. In due time we might also 
consider the possibility of having fixed-term savings accounts 
in foreign currency. 
  These measures, in addition to others that might be 
considered, can be a guarantee for freezing most savings 
accounts deposited in banks. These savings must increase, 
because it is good for the country to have increased savings. 
The measures we might adopt must preserve the mechanisms that 
will encourage savings and the people's savings bank, and we 
must also see that this amount of money is out of circulation as 
long as possible. 
  We have also considered the possibility brought up in the 
workers' parliaments of issuing public-debt bonds. This we can 
consider within the possibilities which have not been used in 
our country for many years but which represent a method employed 
by the state, and a method employed by other countries 
worldwide, to request a long-term loan from our people, a loan 
often payable in more than 10 years, perhaps in 15 or 20 years. 
This loan would help recover with different interest 
alternatives, or without interest, those bonds. We also 
considered the possibility of implementing other variables which 
would appeal to collective subscriptions to these bonds, to a 
movement of patriotic support for this type of debt emission 
which, I repeat, could also yield some results which would 
contribute to long-term freezing of those resources. 
  We must adopt measures that will promote better control of 
the circulation of freely-convertible currency in the country. 
This is a new phenomenon which we began implementing last year, 
and with which we do not have full experience concerning the 
implications and measures we must definitely adopt to achieve 
better control. But undoubtedly some of the ideas brought up in 
the workers' parliaments and other forums, and the ideas brought 
up by the people themselves, are being considered. An example of 
this could be, for instance, changing the currency for one that 
could play that role, a currency that could be called a 
convertible peso [peso convertible] or foreign exchange peso 
[peso-divisa] in the country. This is one of the possibilities 
and it offers a number of benefits because it places that 
monetary circulation under the direct control and sovereignty of 
the Cuban state. This is one of the options we must consider. 
  There are other measures intended to strengthen the state's 
policy to attract the freely-convertible currency through the 
dollar-collecting stores. It is worth repeating that the 
established policy seeks to obtain through high prices the 
highest profit levels possible from those currency holders in 
order to redistribute them equally among other needs the country 
has. We must work toward that purpose and we must also gain the 
understanding of the spirit of this policy because those high 
prices must lead us to understand the reason for implementing 
them. 
  There are other measures which imply the need to strengthen 
the circulation of the peso, and which in some way contribute 
toward compensating for the imbalance created when a 
freely-convertible currency is implemented in the country. Thus, 
the gradual increase in supply of national goods and services 
obtainable in pesos by selected sectors through the stores which 
exist, for example, in our Basic Cooperative Production Units 
[UBPC], the stores created for specific sectors, makes it 
possible, that with the pesos charged by the workers to those 
sectors, a related market is created to give an answer to the 
Cuban peso with a supply which is more or less limited at this 
moment but which can be expanded. This is a measure that will 
contribute toward gradually balancing the purchasing power of 
the peso. 
  Together with this, we must also implement, or study the 
implementation of measures that will provide incentives to the 
workers to increase the supply of goods and services available 
in the national currency in accordance with the country's needs. 
  Some decisions have been made recently, such as in the case 
of the workers involved in the generation of electricity, to 
implement a program of this nature. 
  To the extent possible, this could imply that, when we have 
more production, we can increase the free sale of certain 
products at prices which are in line with the current situation 
we have to face due to the financial imbalance prevailing in the 
country. The possibility of analyses or inventories which are 
still outdated, or some reservations in this distribution 
channel, have not been ruled out. 
  Among the services that could be supplied we can mention, 
for 
instance, the sale of personal, property, and civil 
responsibility insurance which has not been implemented in the 
country to this date. This is a type of mechanism we must 
consider and we must assess as a supplementary mechanism which 
helps protect the people from risk, without directly undermining 
the state's budget. 
  There are other types of measures, such as the advanced 
payment, with a certain level of discount, of the people's debt 
to the People's Savings Bank, debts stemming from personal 
credits or from credits granted for housing. We have made an 
analysis, for instance, that a reasonable discount rate for 
immediate or short-term payments could be granted, according to 
different combinations, and that this could yield between 350 
and 500 million pesos. This idea, if implemented, will surely 
increase the country's potential. 
  We must also consider measures for a selective increase in 
prices and rates. Comrade Ross has submitted several proposals 
collected from different opinions conveyed in the workers' 
parliaments, and we have been analyzing a set of those opinions 
which because of their economic importance, or because of the 
consensus level, are obviously measures that must be taken into 
consideration. 
  Thus, we have discussed the possible implications of the 
elimination of product subsidies, replacing them with subsidies 
to low-income people. This is a measure within our capability 
and which, if implemented, in a short term could yield some 200 
million pesos yearly. 
  The increase in prices of nonessential products: many things 
have been said about different combinations, but undoubtedly 
there is a major level of consensus concerning the adoption of a 
set of measures among which we can mention the possibility of 
increasing cigarette prices. 
  On discussing these matters on different occasions we have 
talked about this measure and that it implies some 
organizational rules. This implies a certain level of control of 
inventories in order to face a demand which has not been 
satisfactory for a relatively lengthy period of several months 
-- since last year -- and how to reach an organization of this 
measure so that this increase in prices will not become an 
additional channel leading to the underground economy and to the 
black market. 
  In our analysis we have realized that prices can be 
increased 
without necessarily eliminating the different distribution 
categories that now exist. That is, it seems advisable to 
consider the possibility of maintaining the distribution 
categories and to increase prices which, among other 
alternatives, could be established in this manner: for instance, 
we are considering the idea of increasing the price of a 
cigarette pack to two pesos in a regular distribution category, 
and to six pesos in the extra-quota category, and to 10 pesos in 
the unregulated category. 
  This, comrades, would probably yield an additional income, 
maintaining an organized distribution and a minimum inventory, 
of 1.954 million additional pesos yearly, if all those 
cigarettes are sold. That is, with or without these prices, 
these measures can yield an amount that is not inconsequential. 
But undoubtedly this is one of the most important measures 
concerning price increases, and cigarettes are not an essential 
article vital for the existence of man. 
  Prices of alcoholic beverages have also been considered, 
taking into account the same characteristics we mentioned 
previously in the case of cigarettes, and the production costs 
that must be considered before putting anything into effect. And 
considering the different categories, of rum and other alcoholic 
beverages, starting from prices in those three scales, for 
instance of 30 and 40... [changes thought] excuse me, from 40, 
30, and 20 [not further specified] for 750 ml bottles. In this 
scale, this increase in prices would provide an additional 
income of 328 million pesos yearly. This is another important 
element we must take into consideration within our analysis. 
  We have also analyzed the possibility -- and all these 
figures stem from an analysis of the production behavior this 
year -- of implementing this measure, not from the point of 
view of potential production, but of production that can be 
achieved. In the case of beer, for instance, and we cannot 
guarantee that it will be achieved, but if the minimum 
production of beer can be achieved every year, only by doubling 
the average price of the bottle of beer in the different 
categories, from retail to wholesale distribution, this could 
yield $135 million pesos yearly. This is a very small amount, I 
repeat, but still it yields some resources that cannot be 
rejected. 
  We also discussed a vehicular fuel price increase as one of 
the possible measures to be adopted, and according to different 
combinations of the premium gasoline, the regular gasoline, and 
diesel, taking into account what appears to be this year's true 
distribution -- which is less than last year, as you well know 
-- it could also yield, according to different combinations 
which in some cases would demand doubling or tripling the price 
per liter, some $80 million more, notwithstanding the reduced 
deliveries we are facing. 
  Concerning utility rates, and Comrade Ross already mentioned 
this, one of the services which has obtained the highest level 
of understanding has been the increase in electricity rates in 
residential areas. Recently, in a television program, our 
comrade [Basic Industry Minister] Marcos Portal explained that 
increasing the electricity rates at this moment is practically 
indispensable, not only to increase the country's income but to 
foster savings in electricity consumption. 
  In the analysis we have jointly made with our comrades from 
the Basic Industry Ministry in an effort to protect the 
low-level consumers, that is, those who consume up to 100 
kilowatts monthly, we have decided to maintain one of the 
variables: not to change the price of nine centavos per 
kilowatt, but increasing it in the other two levels: that is, 
from 100 to 300 kilowatts, and those above 300 kilowatts of 
consumption. These consumers will be charged higher rates, at 
least 20 centavos per kilowatt, and 40 centavos per kilowatt. 
This, in addition to exerting better control and a motivation to 
reduce consumption, could yield approximately 112 million pesos 
more yearly. 
  We have also considered the possibility of increasing 
nonurban transport tariffs, taking into account different 
alternatives and different proposals submitted by our comrades 
from the Transport Ministry, considering the increase in costs: 
fuel, et cetera. This, not to fall into excessive details, and 
if implemented in a short term, could also provide an additional 
income of approximately 100 million pesos. 
  Telephone rates were also mentioned in relation to the 
improvement of services. In this case we have been considering 
some alternatives to increase the telephone rates, not too much, 
but sufficiently only to cover costs and to reduce losses. This 
would yield the small amount of approximately 11 million [pesos]. 
  Other types of services to the people were also considered, 
namely the price of the workers' cafeterias. After thoroughly 
analyzing the proposals submitted by the workers' parliaments, 
we thought that this must be a decentralized decision. That is, 
a central organization cannot say that prices will be increased. 
However, if we manage to achieve -- and this is the calculation 
we have made -- that if the workers' cafeterias manage to cover 
their costs, or whatever the mechanism, in whatever period, and 
with the discussions in each workplace, the country would save 
and also collect an additional 100 million pesos yearly. This is 
the cost the government has to pay in terms of subsidies for 
charging prices lower than the costs. In some cafeterias this is 
not the situation, but in most of them food is sold at current 
prices. 
  We have also studied other services for the population, 
including something we have seen recently, something proposed by 
the Communications Ministry and which has been very little 
mentioned in our discussions: the postal services. 
  The country has for many years maintained the same rates, 
rates which have been unmovable for many years, but the country 
has to cover a loss of approximately 15 million every year in 
order to maintain those services without counting the 
expenditures in hard currency, because the international mail 
also affects us. 
  However, following a proposal we are studying with our 
comrades from the Communications Ministry, -- and this is a 
reasonable proposal -- we have realized that our rates are below 
the rate which is charged abroad throughout the world, and even 
though we are charging a lower rate, we will probably collect 
some 30 million additional pesos with a little increase in 
postal rates. 
  I am mentioning this case becase the service is so broad and 
today we could not discuss in detail all the points assessed, 
but we have found this proposal very interesting. 
  We have also considered the possibility of charging for 
those services that used to be free. It has been explained since 
the previous ANPP session how these measures can have a double 
objective. They can be adopted to increase income, and they can 
also be of educational nature. We have made a thorough 
evaluation of the range of services which are free of charge and 
which could be considered in this case. 
  We have also discussed matters with which we could agree, 
and 
matters with which we could not agree, at least in our opinion, 
but our intention has always been to evaluate almost everything 
proposed and which can be evaluated, because there are some 
matters that are impossible to evaluate. 
  However, we have considered some of these measures perhaps 
because of their economic importance or perhaps because they are 
feasible, namely those which could yield something additional. 
For instance, in the educational area we have taken into 
consideration those points which have been consistently 
mentioned in the workers' parliaments, such as charging for 
lunch served in boarding schools, at least a minimum rate, which 
in this case has been set at 35 centavos. This, according to the 
number of fees and the days of the week when the students eat in 
the schools, could yield approximately 29 million pesos yearly. 
  As you see, this is not a very high figure, but this is one 
of the areas in the area of education which it was believed 
could yield the largest amount of pesos, and it is one of the 
points we can consider. 
  We have also discussed the reduction of allowances granted 
to 
university students, although 20 percent of the population, 
which is the percentage of the population with the lowest 
income, would not be included in this reduction. That is, this 
measure would be implemented among those people not considered 
of lower income. Concerning the reduction of allowances granted 
to university students, excluding the foreign grantees who would 
not be affected, obviously, would yield some 17 million [pesos] 
should this decision be adopted. 
  School supplies distributed among students have also been 
the 
object of discussions in the workers parliaments. For the level 
of school supplies distributed at this moment we could obtain 
approximately 4.7 million pesos yearly by charging very low 
prices which would be accessible to the people. 
  Many proposals were submitted in the health area, and after 
analyzing them, we thought that not all of them were in line 
with the policy outlined by our revolution, concerning public 
health. But there was one which circulated with some force and 
some argument, concerning the free distribution of neovitamins. 
And how much could be collected if the people were asked for 
only the cost of that medicine? Well, this and other medicines 
which could be added would yield 103 million pesos yearly. 
  There are other proposals which we did not consider 
appropriate, such as charging something for ambulance services 
or other services which, although they do have a cost, we 
believe that, from our point of view, cannot be considered. 
  We also considered the possibility of charging fees for 
cultural and sports activities. One of the proposals which have 
received major support, according to the reports by the workers 
parliaments, is charging for a ticket for sports events. 
However, if we consider charging a reasonable entrance fee, it 
would yield approximately 4.5 million pesos yearly, but there 
are many who oppose this idea. 
  There are also measures related to culture. Charging 
entrance 
fees for artistic shows would yield some 4.8 million pesos, but 
excluding again the lowest income people, who make up some 20 
percent of the population. Thus, the reduction of subsidies, 
which is currently paid to some institutions, centers, and 
provincial councils for culture, could also yield some 11 
million pesos. 
  The other element also discussed in the previous assembly, 
referring to classes in preparation for sports events, was 
activities that can be organized during vacation periods to 
offer a recreational activity that might contemplate the 
practice of some sports, thus charging a modest fee during the 
school recess periods, during the school vacation periods. This 
would also yield some 15 million pesos yearly. 
  This means that in the field of free services there is a 
broad range of subjects to be discussed. We could spend hours 
here talking about this matter. We have only mentioned those 
which we think have greater possibilities of being approved and 
which could yield some relatively large amount of resources. But 
as you will see, these cannot be compared to other categories of 
measures we have to evaluate. 
  Measures for a gradual implementation of a tax system on a 
sector of the population: this is one of the most controversial 
measures, as it was explained here. The workers have expressed a 
clear position in the workers parliaments against the imposition 
of a tax on wages. We must remember, however, comrades, that 
income tax in our country not only affects the salary earners. 
We also have a tax on self-employed workers. The state is 
expected to collect this year 126 million pesos from this tax. 
Yesterday, during a meeting with the presidents of the 
provincial and administrative councils, we considered the 
implementation of this measure and the system of payment, and 
especially the manner of increasing the minimum tax installment. 
By December only nine municipalities in the country were 
implementing this measure, but today we can report that 76 
municipalities in 11 provinces have already increased those 
installments. In some cases, as in Holguin Province, these 
installments have gone up to 1,000 pesos monthly for certain 
types of employment. There are other tax installments amounting 
to 600 pesos and to 200 pesos. By the closing of the March 
report, Holguin was the only province that could talk about a 
per capita income resulting from the increased tax installments 
which are already being paid, and for this reason its income is 
higher. Holguin thus has one of the highest tax rates in the 
country. 
  This would be a type of tax which we must preserve and which 
we must increase as a regulating and an income element. These 
two elements must be maintained until we can get to the 
progressive tax on income. We are already preparing a proposal 
to be submitted to the government so that when the conditions 
are appropriate, it can be implemented. 
  I must also inform you that other rates and tariffs are 
being implemented, and not only the tax to be paid for the right 
to be self-employed, but we are also charging a tax for the 
right to use space and means. The marketing right is also being 
taxed in 77 municipalities throughout the country, which means 
that the self- employed worker carries out his activity outside 
the province where he was originally registered. These taxes are 
already in effect. 
  This means that we are beginning to implement a policy of 
tax 
on these workers' income. Today there are more than 153,000 
self- employed workers in the country, and it is appropriate to 
impose a tax policy on their income. And as you can see, this 
tax is not paid only on salaries but also on income. 
  We have been studying the possibility of reviewing the tax 
on 
the income of peasants and cooperative members. We must study 
and evaluate this because the CPA [Agricultural-Livestock 
Cooperative] is paying 5 percent over its net income while the 
peasants pay another 5 percent individually. However, we must 
still consolidate these taxes in accordance with the tax that 
the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] must pay. We are 
still studying these taxes. 
  We have also considered the possibility of charging a tax on 
foreign currency income. There are some people in the country 
who earn an income in foreign currency, not through salaries but 
through other payments. I want to explain that we are not 
thinking in this case of remittances, but of those people who, 
after being authorized, receive these payments for exercising 
certain activities compensated in hard currency, or which 
receive a bonus or an extra payment in foreign currency. This is 
another option we will probably analyze. 
  There is another thing brought up in the assemblies, such as 
the tax on properties which we have analyzed, that is, the tax 
on home ownership. Today most homes are owned, and this can also 
be considered in due time, concerning what kind of tax can be 
charged on home ownerships, and not only on homes but also on 
empty lots, and on a number of properties existing in the 
country, such as real estate. 
  The workers' possible contribution toward social security 
has also been analyzed. This possibility has been discussed 
taking into account the deficit existing between the 
contributions to social security and what the country spends on 
social security, a deficit which amounts to some 500 million 
[pesos]. We have been studying several options, different 
categories, and the different times when this could be 
implemented. This is one more of the measures we have in our 
arsenal to be considered. 
  And there are other types of taxes we must not forget, such 
as the tax on ground transportation, and according to results of 
the analysis, this could yield approximately 10 million pesos 
annually. Allow me to tell you also that this year there was 
better discipline concerning the payment of the tax on ground 
transporation. The people seem to have acquired some tax 
knowledge to such a point that we ran out of tax forms [laughs]. 
  There is a reaction to the payment of this tax. And we also 
have the tax on documents and the seal on stamps, and these 
together will yield 23 million pesos. 
  And we also have other types of taxes the state would like 
to 
implement. One of them could be the tax on aqueduct service, 
better known as the water bill. As you know, the country today 
has only one way of collecting these bills, and this is done 
through water meters, although this service is not extended 
throughout the country and we cannot think about this 
possibility today. We could consider a fixed rate for aqueduct 
service, and if only one peso were charged per person monthly, 
it would yield some 90 million pesos yearly, and thus we would 
be covering an important service which at this moment is 
receiving a minimal income by way of the water meters. 
  Fines for personal delinquency also increased this year. 
Violations of Decree 186 on special delinquency of self-employed 
workers have increased in several provinces. This income could 
amount to some 17 million pesos this year. Last year the fines 
dropped by a little more than 4 percent. During the first 
quarter ending this month fines increased a little more than 9 
percent. This means that there is still much to be done in this 
area, but we are working on it. 
  We have also considered the possbility of changing our 
money. 
We must put this measure within the arsenal of possibilities. As 
Comrade Ross said, there are many ways of doing it, there are 
many variables, and I can tell you that the variables that prove 
to be suitable might be implemented. This is not a problem we 
cannot solve, but we do have the obligation to take up this 
measure as a possibility. 
  So, comrades, we have tried to analyze all these problems 
with the sole objective of providing to our government and to 
you in this parliament, some facts which, once the causes of 
these problems and the possible solutions are known, will help 
us work toward the achievement of those solutions. But we do 
have to adopt the measures that will definitely guarantee an 
effective solution to the excess currency in the country. To 
achieve this we must understand that we must willing to do 
anything possible because this is the essential obstacle we are 
internally facing today in making our economy successful. 
  These measures would not be complete if we did not also 
demand, considering the sacrifice our workers are making, the 
repression of those who have accrued wealth illegally either 
through theft or speculation, taking unscrupulous advantage of 
the scarcity our people face to achieve their personal wealth. 
These deeds cannot and must not remain unpunished. 
  The process which will be implemented through the agreements 
adopted by this National Assembly will play a role which will be 
decisive in itself in accordance with the order and discipline 
which we might impose, without hastiness but with a sense of 
responsibility we must all share. The measures to be adopted by 
the government to implement these measures will also be 
decisive, keeping in mind that this will be a gradual process 
that will demand indispensable adjustments or changes to the 
extent that we keep advancing. 
  Starting from these discussions, we are certain that the 
vital interests of the people will be respected. We feel 
optimistic therefore, and in good spirits. We know that if we 
have resisted thus far, we will will not lack strength and 
intelligence to keep taking steps forward. 
  We believe that our people will have the great privilege to 
celebrate this 1 May as protagonists aware of their own 
solutions to the serious problems we are facing, certain of the 
victory with Fidel as leader as it has always been and as it 
will always be, because all Cubans will fight with him for this 
goal. Thank you very much. [applause]

<F P=106> [Address by Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the </F>
National Assembly of the People's Government, ANPP, to the 
special session of the ANPP, at the Havana Convention Center, on 
2 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] I believe that not only the discussion of this 
special session, but the entire national debate preceding it, 
have clearly confirmed the will of our people to persevere in 
their chosen path, to continue resisting and fighting to save 
our socialist revolution. I also believe that we have to be 
fully convinced that the only way out of the special period is 
the revolutionary, socialist, steadfast path we are undertaking. 
This way out, of course, demands effort, work, and sacrifice. 
However, that effort, work, and sacrifice are worthy. Comrade 
Estruch [Deputy Luis Estruch Lacano] pointed out several 
important things which serve to compare Cuba's situation at the 
time of the triumph of the Revolution with the immense 
transformation that has taken place, particularly, in comparison 
with the reality of today's difficult moment. 
  I believe that our people have confirmed their commitment to 
the ideals of socialism and their rejection of certain dogmatic 
ideas being forced upon today's world, and in Cuba's case, from 
abroad. Capitalism will not be Cuba's future because capitalism 
was its painful and sad past. Our people will never return to 
the past. 
  Listening to Estruch, I remembered certain elements which I 
believe our people remember and understand. Our people are a 
cultured, intelligent people, a well-educated people as result 
of all that effort alluded to by Estruch and other comrades. 
Since I agree with Estruch that part of this great battle for 
the national economy -- to correct our finances and stimulate 
the economy -- is also a political battle, it seems right to 
refresh our memory with some information which clearly 
illustrates the reality of that capitalist past, and also 
illustrates -- and we can not forget this because the special 
period irritates us, pains us, and causes daily difficulties for 
everyone -- that a special period, a difficult and anguished 
living, a true hell, was the life the immense majority of our 
men and women knew for most of Cuba's history until 1959. 
  I have here certain points of reference, not produced by us, 
by the revolutionary movement, but by unsuspected sources. This 
document, this book, was not published by the Revolution but by 
the Batista regime. It is the Population, Housing, and Electoral 
Census of the Republic of Cuba of January 1953. 
  This other book was not published by Cuban revolutionaries 
either. It is an official document of the U.S. Government from 
that period aimed at U.S. investors and includes a study of the 
Cuban economy conducted three years after the Batista census, 
and has among other things certain criticisms of results of the 
census. 
  In the study conducted by Batista's authorities, we see 
certain data which portray Cuba, as a country difficult to 
imagine for today's Cubans. The census partially covered the 
issue of housing. There were, nationwide, 1,250,594 houses 
ranging from the most luxurious mansions to the most modest 
shacks of the most humble of our peasants. I will give some of 
the data included in this report. Regarding construction, the 
authorities classified it in a list beginning with masonry, 
cement slab roof, and floors of a higher quality than plain 
cement construction. The list continued down to a humble thatch 
hut or something similar and earth floors. 
  In the Republic of Cuba, according to the 1953 census, 27.8 
percent of the houses were masonry and cement construction and 
32.2 percent were thatch and earth floors. Of course, in rural 
areas, there were more than double the amount in this lower 
category. However, in the urban areas, in our large cities, 10.2 
percent of the houses, according to the 1953 census, had earth 
floors and had no other material for roofs and walls than thatch. 
  The aqueduct reached only 35.2 percent of the houses and a 
little more than half the urban houses. Sanitary service was 
available to only 28 percent of the houses, including 32.8 
percent of urban houses. 
  The same happens here. They do a classification ranging from 
houses with indoor sanitary service to private latrines, and 
communal latrines, and ending with the no sanitary service 
category. Some 23.2 percent of the homes fell in this category. 
Some 45.6 percent of all the homes in Cuba lacked baths or 
shower facilities. Barely 48 percent of the homes had 
electricity. However, 75.2 percent of the homes nationwide 
lacked refrigerators, iceboxes, or any equipment to conserve 
food, including 62.5 percent of the urban homes. 
  The U.S. Commerce Department study confirms that the 
situation remained unchanged three years later. This is 
regarding housing. Regarding education, the 1953 census reveals 
that 23.6 percent of the population was illiterate. 
  With good reason, the U.S. Commerce Department study 
criticizes the accuracy of the Batista census regarding this 
aspect. First of all, it points out that the people who did the 
census simply asked the people if they knew how to read and 
write. Some 23.6 percent responded no. However, the American 
researchers pointed out that more revealing data is found in the 
census. Such as that illiteracy was much higher among 10- to 
14-year-olds, which was 31.8 percent; that 31 percent of the 
entire Cuban population had not had any formal education; and 
that only 11 percent had gone beyond primary school education. 
The Americans' conclusion was that true illiteracy was much 
higher than that reflected in the official Cuban census and that 
the republic was regressing given the extremely low school 
attendance level. For example, of 2,459,730 youths, individuals 
between 5 and 24 years of age, 1,619,535 -- about half -- did 
not receive any type of education in Cuba in 1953. From this we 
have to deduce that in any event, illiteracy would continue to 
increase if we interpret correctly the information provided by 
the Batista government. 
  In 1956, the Americans pointed out other important 
characteristics, we can even call them manipulations, of the 
1953 census. First of all, it was conducted in the month of 
January, in the midst of the sugarcane harvest, at the moment of 
the highest economic activity and thus the information on the 
workers, the poor would be higher than at any other time of the 
year. In addition, in the U.S. study -- Investment in Cuba, 
Basic Information for U.S. Businessmen, Commerce Department, 
Washington, 1956 -- the Americans point out that in that period, 
the first half of the decade of the 1950's, certain Cuban 
economic indicators had had their best performance in comparison 
with the republican period preceding it, and that the year with 
the highest per capita income, at the time, was 1952 -- the year 
before the census. 
  Those who extol the advantages of capitalism, and try to 
portray that system as every man's alternative, better not 
harbor any dreams because this American document explains that 
in 1952 Cuba attained a third of the per capita income of the 
states in the southeastern United States. There is something 
even more revealing, Cuba's best year in terms of per capita 
income, the apex of our capitalist development according to 
them, was equivalent to half the per capita income of 
Mississippi in its worst year. 
  In other words, according to them, when Cuba attained its 
highest point, it had reached half the level of the worst year 
of the poorest and most backward state in the United States, 
Mississippi. 
  What does this top year of capitalism reveal to us? 
Batista's 
census did not concern itself much -- and this was also pointed 
out by the Commerce Department study -- with unemployment and 
workers conditions. However, they missed certain indicators. 
They, for example, found out the number of weeks worked by the 
people covered by the census in 1952 -- the famous apex year of 
capitalist development according to the Yankees. Some 36.8 
percent of the Cuban labor force had worked every week in 1952, 
and the great majority of those who had worked or looked for 
jobs in that year of capitalist glory, 48.7 percent of the 
workers, had not worked even 10 weeks. 
  We would have to ask if it was a pure coincidence of history 
that at the time when the reality of our country was described 
in this manner -- poverty-stricken, lugubrious, painful -- by 
the Batista era census, Fidel Castro and a group of youths were 
preparing to assault the Moncada Barracks and rekindle the 
revolutionary movement of our people. Was it possible to 
continue in that lamentable, painful state of the better period, 
of the top development of capitalism in Cuba, when that was the 
best it did for our people? 
  Could anyone be surprised if in 1956, when the Commerce 
Department issued this study, Fidel Castro and his comrades were 
preparing to land in our fatherland and restart the postponed 
but never interrupted war of our people to put an end to that 
hell capitalism brought for the majority of our people? Can 
anyone think that this people could prefer that type of society 
which reserved for the majority ignorance, lack of education, 
poverty, and misery? 
  The 1956 study also covers other aspects of the economy 
which 
the Batista census had overlooked. In its analysis of our 
countryside, it reveals that less than eight percent of the 
farms occupied three fourths of the arable land in Cuba, and 
that less than half of one percent of those farms controlled a 
third of the arable lands. That is the phenomena of the 
latifundia. 
  This explains other data, other realities, which other 
entirely reliable reports also revealed at that time. I refer to 
a third document. This study by the Catholic University 
Association of Havana, which was not in any way a radical group, 
was conducted in 1957, a year after the U.S. Commerce Department 
study. They discovered, regarding the farmers' nutrition, that 
the percentage that eat meat was four percent; fish, less than 
one percent; eggs, 2.12 percent; milk, 11.22 percent; bread, 
3.36 percent; cornmeal, 7 percent; vegetables, zero percent. The 
Catholic group also researched the health conditions of our 
farmers and found higher percentages than those I just mentioned 
regarding food. Tuberculosis, 14 percent; typhus, 13 percent; 
intestinal parasitism, 36 percent; and malaria, 31 percent, 
among the people polled. 
  The highest percentage included in this document results 
from 
asking the peasants what they desire the most, what is most 
important for them, what they need the most. Some 73.46 percent 
responded with one word: Work. 
  Can anyone be surprised that our people were at this time, 
as 
the Catholic researchers were conducting this study, persevering 
in the struggle in the mountains and savannas to jostle free 
from that regime. Is that society really an alternative for 
anyone? Was it or was it not a special period without escape, 
hope, justice, or equality endured by those peasants demanding 
work, peasants pained by tuberculosis or malnutrition. Was this 
not a true hell into which the immense majority of our 
population was born, lived, and endured until death? Our people 
not only remember but also, because they are a knowledgeable, 
informed people, they know that millions upon millions of people 
in this world also endure special periods without equality, 
justice, escape, or hope. True hells are being experienced by 
the peoples in many parts of the world. 
  This U.S. magazine published by THE MIAMI HERALD features on 
the front page an issue of growing concern in the United States: 
what they call the homeless. People who as a result of 
capitalist measures have found it impossible to continue paying 
rent and have ended up on the streets, the only place available. 
This young woman on the front page with her two small daughters 
is not worried about her salary, taxes, or even the cost of food 
or salaries. The sign states that she will work for food. She 
offers her labor for food for herself and her two daughters. 
Poor woman, she is not thinking about how to pay for school 
uniforms for her daughters or their school breakfast or lunch. 
There is no school for those girls, nor is there a job for this 
woman. She is simply bartering her labor for food -- that is on 
the front page. 
  The inside, features a man whose sign reads: I am 74 years 
old and destitute. I am a homeless person but not a bum. I have 
worked since I was 14 years old. This is typical in capitalism 
where a man, after working for 63 years, has no other 
alternative but to stand on a city corner and beg. 
  There is something else that is very interesting. The text 
explains that in 1990, according to the U.S. Census Office, 
there where 228,621 homeless people. Certain liberal U.S. 
organizations, of course, say that this figure does not reflect 
the reality and that there were many more. However, I prefer to 
focus on another aspect of this issue. There were over 228,000 
homeless in 1990. In 1993, the same source, the U.S. Census 
Office, estimates there were 2 million homeless. In other words, 
between 1990 and 1993, according to their official data, the 
number of homeless -- people such as this old man, this young 
woman, these girls -- has increased tenfold. This coincides with 
these difficult years we Cubans call the special period. I ask 
myself: Is there a special period in the United States? Is 
anyone imposing a financial, economic, and commercial blockade 
on that country? Have the U.S. main trading partners 
disappeared? Have their markets collapsed? Has any madman, any 
Torricelli in this world, come up with a law to prohibit and 
obstruct trade with the United States? What explains that 
instead of improving, there has been a tenfold increase in those 
people experiencing the living conditions of a special period in 
the United States? 
  I also have here THE MIAMI HERALD edition of 20 March, right 
at the time we were in the workers assemblies discussing, 
analyzing collectively, and seeking means and ways to confront 
our difficulties. I want to give you the example of financial 
measures implemented capitalist style. 
  One day, a real estate company or some landlord of an 
apartment building in the United States decided there had to be 
a rent increase to improve the margin of profit and make the 
corporation more efficient. Was a workers assembly summoned? 
Were the tenants asked how much they ought to or could afford to 
pay? 
  This article describes how the measure was taken. It was 
simply this. [Knocks three times on the table] One night -- 
states one of the two boys interviewed -- there was a knock on 
the door and someone told mom that the apartment rent was -- it 
most be an extremely modest place because it has been a long 
time since you could find anything but a small room for this 
amount I am going to say -- $295 a month. This was the rent this 
humble working woman was paying. Someone implemented that 
measure [three knocks] and told her: From now on the rent is 
$325 and that is that. 
  She had no other choice, stated her son: Mom sat both of us 
down and told us that we were going to sleep on the streets 
because the rent had gone up. 
  Measures such as this one, by the thousands, are adopted by 
capitalism everyday, and these are the consequences, this 
picture. The boys showed the reporter their home. As you can see 
it is the underside of a bridge in Miami where they spent last 
winter. 
  The text of the article cites another interesting fact. Not 
about the homeless in general, but about homeless children in 
Florida in particular. The number of homeless children in the 
state, according to a study by a Florida university, was 50,000 
in 1993. This is three times the number of children in Florida 
living on the streets. [as heard] Are these children or are they 
not living in a totally unfair special period because it is not 
the result of any external factor upon that society but the 
intrinsic characteristics of that society which result in some 
living in opulence and dissipation while many others are denied 
the most essential rights. 
  Comrades, we face the challenge of being able to continue to 
resist, struggle, and make whatever sacrifices necessary to 
preserve a society incomparably superior to the one being forced 
upon us by those trying to turn into a universally mandatory 
dogma that truly abominable life style and forms of human 
interaction that ought to have been abandoned in prehistory. We 
have no other alternative but to save this revolution, this 
socialist endeavor, to overcome the current difficult period 
with a revolutionary spirit, the socialist way because the 
alternative is that past reflected by the Batista era census, or 
the Yankee study, or the Catholic University Association. That 
past is the present of hundreds of millions of people in this 
world, such as these Americans I have referred to. 
  Finally, I have another publication from Florida. There is 
great interest abroad regarding what happens in Cuba, regarding 
the result of our efforts, our struggle to overcome the special 
period. There are people, those who benefited from the misery 
and poverty of the majority of Cubans, those who never underwent 
any special period yet imposed it on the majority of the people 
in the past, who harbor dreams and believe the time will come 
again when they can return, regain their privileges, and once 
more impose on the majority of the people that past which shall 
never return. 
  I have here a copy of the SOUTH FLORIDA magazine which 
contains several articles in this regard. The man on the left is 
a former landowner. In the article he describes his mansion, of 
course, it had sanitary hook-ups, showers, electricity, and 
everything else. The mansion was so luxurious that he now 
complains that his backyard is no longer private [word play on a 
nursery rhyme]. It is filled with children playing, playing 
sports because his large mansion is today a large school. On top 
of this, he complains that there are even black and mulatto 
children among them, colored people that were not even allowed 
on the streets of his neighborhoods during the era of the 
Batista census. He explains their plans so that upon their 
return, once the revolution is defeated according to their 
dreams, that school will be turned into a private mansion once 
again. The name of the article is: This land is my land. 
  The article on the left [as heard] -- those with a good 
memory perhaps remember the Cuban Landowners Association which 
grouped the owners of the sugar mills. They have a group named 
the Cuban Landowners Association in Exile. In the article they 
explain their plan. They plan to retake their mills, to return 
the lands to the landowners, to once again place our peasants in 
the conditions which the Catholic Association mentioned, to make 
over 65 percent of the population hope for jobs. 
  We have to defend this project under the particularly 
difficult conditions this country faces because, without a 
shadow of a doubt, capitalism would mean a return to that past 
we knew. However, it would be amplified by the hate, ire, and 
fury which that minority would try to impose on our people, that 
minority which today dreams of returning and was responsible for 
making life for the majority of us nothing but a perpetual 
special period without hope or end. 
  Of course, in the workers assemblies, in every meeting 
held, and in this ANPP session the Cuban people are telling 
those people: You shall not pass. [applause] 
  Recently, our people commemorated the 125th anniversary of 
the Guaimaro Assembly, six months after the beginning of our 
first war of independence, six months after the beginning of the 
only Cuban revolution, the one begun by Cespedes and fulfilled 
by Fidel Castro, the patriots, the revolutionaries meet in that 
tiny town in Camaguey to find the indispensable patriotic 
consensus, to unite ideas and wills, to organize the struggle 
under the terrible and difficult circumstance faced by our 
people from the beginning. The Cuban patriots and 
revolutionaries met without relinquishing the machete, without 
relinquishing the struggle against Spanish colonialism, and as 
our people were also confronting -- as foretold by Cespedes -- 
the threat of the U.S. policy seeking to take Cuba over. 
Cespedes said that was the hidden agenda of their policy. 
  The Cuban people were capable of overcoming differences and 
putting, above all, the ideal of an independent and just 
fatherland, a fatherland rooted in human solidarity and equality. 
  Today, 125 years later, the Cuban people have recreated 
Guaimaro everywhere, have revived the spirit of our forefathers, 
and have been able to reason, discuss, and examine frankly our 
points of view to unite ideas and wills. We have not held 
academic debates, but fraternal discussions, and collective 
analysis in the midst of the struggle and on behalf of the 
struggle. 
  May Guaimaro's spirit live eternally among us. May we be 
capable of continuing, like Cespedes, Agramonte, and all the men 
of that generation, who sacrificed everything, that ideal of 
independence and justice. May we continue to develop our 
collective wisdom with the combat spirit of the men of Guaimaro, 
in the struggle and for the struggle. 
  I believe and am convinced that this is the required route 
for every patriot, and the route we will follow, and through it 
we will attain victory, despite everything, despite all the 
difficulties and sacrifices we might have to endure. Thank You 
very much. [applause]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon; from the "Evening </F>
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The fundamental working recommendations made by the 
Cuban Parliament to the Cuban Government will demand of the 
people significant sacrifices and a necessary belt-tightening 
once these become law. The recently concluded special session 
of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] 
outlined the policy to be followed by the executive branch in 
overcoming the serious budget deficit, which amounts to 4.2 
billion pesos, and the excessive money supply, which is on the 
order of 11.6 billion pesos. Among the suggestions made by the 
Cuban deputies are: selective raising of tariffs on nonessential 
products, elimination of certain [word indistinct], 
establishment of a tax system, reduction of subsidies for 
certain products, granting of subsidies to low income earners, 
and reduction in state allocations for unprofitable businesses, 
a measure already being implemented. 
  Cuba has been able to face the consequences of previous 
stages of the current crisis because even though the U.S. 
economic blockade existed, its effects were attenuated by the 
advantageous relations with Europe's former socialist countries. 
For many years, Cubans enjoyed the benefits of a just and equal 
distribution of health care, medical attention, and social 
security. Also, there has been equal distribution and subsidy 
of rationed products offered at extremely low prices. Access to 
some public services has continued to be free. With the 
disappearance of the former socialist bloc, the entire weight of 
the U.S. economic blockade has been felt. If we add to this the 
fact that credit is nonexistent and that this is an 
underdeveloped nation, we must conclude that Cuba now finds 
itself in a very adverse position which does not permit 
resorting to yesterday's solutions. 
  The Parliament recommended to the government fundamental 
guidelines for adopting in coming weeks and months a series of 
realistic measures consonant with the current situation. 
Perhaps after a reasonable period, preliminary reports will 
show positive results. Cubans understand the need for adopting 
this strategy, although not all of them are capable of 
specifically adapting to the stringency of some of the measures 
-- hence the importance of a process of popular discussions in 
the country that will seek consensus. Only at the end of the 
discussions, sponsored by the unions, did Parliament reach 
conclusions on recommendations to the government. 
  It was seen that premeditated solutions are difficult and do 
not have unanimous support. But solutions will never be 
proposed behind the people's back. Cubans with low incomes will 
not be neglected. At the same time, the 11 million inhabitants 
of the island will continue to enjoy the principal social 
achievements, such as education, health, and social security 
[words indistinct].

<F P=106> [Interview with reporter Luis Sexto, from BOHEMIA magazine, </F>
by reporter Osvalso Rodriguez, from JUVENTUD REBELDE, on the 
"Straight Talk" program on 3 May] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Rodriguez] This is Osvaldo 
Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE, and we are talking to Luis 
Sexto from BOHEMIA magazine. We are talking about freedom of 
speech in Cuba, today being international freedom of speech day. 
  Luis, I believe every time someone talks about freedom of 
speech, people think about the media, and we as a medium have 
the right to refer to that today, taking advantage of the fact 
that today the media belongs to us and the people. And I 
believe that we need to point out that the media in Cuba are in 
favor of the people and that the work we do is in favor of the 
people and national interests. I believe it is important to 
define it like this, in discussing this topic, because many 
times, people talk about freedom of the press and freedom of the 
press understood in traditional terms, where freedom of speech 
is to be able to use the media to oppose the decisions of the 
government. 
  Well, we would also have to look at up to what point they 
oppose government decisions and how many interests are combined 
for those decisions and that opposition. In Cuba, we have 
followed a policy, which I support and believe should be eternal 
as long as we have such a strong enemy like the United States, 
and it is that the media does not allow nor give any space for a 
criteria that goes against the popular majority and against the 
people, and against the government approved by the people. 
  [Sexto] The famous freedom of the press is one of the forms 
of freedom of speech. Sometimes freedom of speech is confused 
with the famous freedom of the press, and I believe that is not 
the way it should be. Freedom of the press, or the media, is one 
of the channels for the people to express themselves. Seconds 
ago, we referred to how, in Cuba, there are a series of 
mechanisms to facilitate and channel freedom of speech. 
  [Rodriguez] Do do consider yourself a free reporter? 
  [Sexto] I consider myself a free reporter to the point that 
I 
am not capable of writing or talking about something I am not 
convinced of. And I believe I have the right to tell the 
director of the magazine, when I am ordered to write a 
commentary on something I do not feel comfortable with, to get 
someone else to do it. That has been my norm as a professional 
during twenty years as a reporter. 
  [Rodriguez] That does not mean that there are some reporters 
who have written things they have not agreed with. 
  [Sexto] No, just like there are people who go to meetings 
and 
do not say everything they believe because they are cowards. 
  [Rodriguez] Just like there are people who have said 
something on the street and have been censured by someone... 
  [Sexto interrupting] By some citizen. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, by a citizen, who has censured him and has 
even denied him his right to have a different point of view. 
  [Sexto] Yes, he has been reprimanded verbally, right? He has 
responded to a determined expression. 
  Now, getting back to the media, the same happens with 
freedom 
of speech. The media cannot be separated from society. Freedom 
of the press cannot be separated from the determined society, 
from the classical structure of a determined society. The media 
is an instrument of the majority. No one should think that the 
media is a fourth power, as many have said and as many continue 
to believe. That is absurd. The media is always subordinate to 
the dominant interests in a society. But in our country, the 
media, which has its defects and problems, is subordinate to the 
interests of the nation, the interests of the people. That is 
the way it is. 
  Do you think it would be wise to give room for ideas of 
annexation in our media? Don't you think it would be suicidal to 
allow those who favor annexation to defend their point in our 
newspapers, especially during these difficult times that our 
country is facing? 
  [Rodriguez] I agree. I believe the opposition cannot have a 
voice in our media because the opposition already has a voice in 
the media of our enemies.

  [Text] The recently dedicated Maya Aqueduct will benefit 
more than 14,000 people, representing more than half the 
population of Maisi Muncipality, the easternmost point in Cuba 
and the main coffee producer in the country. Further details on 
this by reporter Leonel Perez Moya: 
  [Begin Perez recording] Using its own resources, at a cost 
of 
690,000 pesos, the revamped plant operates by gravity and 
replaces the old, inefficient installation that has been 
corroded by inclement weather. The approximate five km of 
conduits and pipes of various diameters, leading to the main 
duct, replaces the pumping system, with an annual savings of 590 
megawatts of electricity. 
  This inexpensive technology provides for a continuous supply 
of potable water to residents of Punta de Maisi on the 
easternmost point of the nation; to La Maquina, the center of 
Maisi Municipality; and to eight other populated settlements. 
Water is also carried to the largest coffee plant in the zone 
and to the family doctors' offices, to schools, minifarms, 
agricultural areas, and other socioeconomic institutions. [end

  [Text] The workers of the modern Antonio Guiteras Electric 
Plant in Matanzas City will stop work tonight, following 124 
days of continuous operation of the 130-megawatt unit, to 
conduct a three-day maintenance program on the boiler. This was 
announced by plant manager Jesus Valdez Torra, who added that on 
this occasion there will be no need for support from other 
organizations and that the plant workers will undertake the 
maintenance program without problems, given that all the 
required parts are at hand. 
  With the shutdown at the Antonio Guiteras plant, the 
National 
Electric System will reduce its electric generation capacity by 
10 percent. This will be reflected in a slight outage increase. 
However, as soon as the gas circulator unit of the boiler is 
repaired, which is expected to be completed by 8 May, the unit 
will be ready to produce the 330 megawatts it regularly 
produces, with low fuel consumption and the highest efficiency 
to date in the electric sector.

  [Text] Cuba's President Fidel Castro arrived in Barbados 
last evening to attend a high-level session of the United 
Nations Global Conference on Small Island Developing States, 
SIDS. As we hear from this dispatch by (Nublen Brewster), the 
arrival of this controversial leader has caused quite a stir. 
  [Begin Brewster recording] Scores of journalists waited 
outside the [name indistinct] Civil Airport from as early as 
1900. An hour and a half later, Cuba's President Fidel Castro, 
resplendent in his customary army green uniform, alighted from a 
Cubana airline. Flanked on either side by his personal 
interpreter and several [word indistinct] bodyguards, he greeted 
Cuba's resident ambassador, (Lazaro Cabeza), and Barbados 
Foreign Minister Bainford Taitt. 
  Then he spoke to an anxious press corps who struggled with 
Cuban and U.S. security guards to capture his first words on 
tape. Some of us were shoved, even trampled, as the security 
officials tried to keep voracious journalists at bay. 
  Speaking through his interpreter, [words indistinct], 
President Castro said he is pleased to be in Barbados again. He 
had stopped here more than 20 years ago while on his way to 
another [word indistinct] summit. He was then quickly escorted 
to a waiting Mercedes. We shadowed him and his interpreter to a 
plush [word indistinct] hotel. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Our reporter Edner Jean reports on the session 
held on 4 May in the Chamber of Deputies: 
  [Begin Jean recording] This session was held at a time when 
it was basically unexpected. It was only at 1900 GMT that the 
office of the Chamber was able to muster the necessary working 
quorum. Forty-two deputies from the Alliance, plus the 
socialists, participated together to open the session, BP-FNCD 
[Parliamentary Bloc of the National Front for Change and 
Democracy] having decided to return to its old empty-seat policy. 
  Deputy Vital Pierre Francois then proposed reducing the 
quorum to 39 deputies, which would have relaunched the 
controversy on the status of those elected on 18 January. After 
some thorny discussions, the assembly agreed that those 20 
contested deputies voluntarily refrained from participating 
since the signing of the New York pact. The concession, however, 
was made to list their names on the roll. Clearly, the office of 
the Chamber of Deputies keeps those contested deputies as a 
spare solution, which could be useful if and when necessary. 
  Then the key point of this session was addressed, the reason 
for which the assembly was convened: the development of the 
political situation and the means of filling the governmental 
vacuum. The socialists presented their analysis of the 
situation. According to them, Article 148 is presently 
inapplicable without the approval of President Aristide. Article 
149 is out of date and Article 111 is maladapted. Duly Brutus, 
spokesman for the socialist bloc, again recommended political 
compromise and sacrifice as a solution to the crisis. He asked 
President Monde to immediately consult with General Cedras for 
the purpose of convincing the Army's commander in chief that he 
should make the gesture that the international community is 
expecting of him, meaning to resign. This proposal raised a stir 
in the room. [passage omitted] 
  Deputy Joseph Lambert, one of the leading lights of the 
Alliance, proposed a resolution bill inspired by Article 111 of 
the Constitution, which will give the National Assembly the 
right to nominate an ad hoc prime minister until President 
Aristide decides to appoint another head of government. [passage 
omitted] 
  In reaction to the U.S. threat of military intervention as a 
solution to the crisis, Deputy Lambert proposed a second 
resolution bill, declaring the Legislative Palace the place of 
high resistance against foreign military intervention. This bill 
added that President Aristide is mandated to consult with the 
Haitian Armed Forces for necessary measures to safeguard the 
territory's integrity. If not, he will be accountable for this 
violation of our national sovereignty. These two bills were not 
voted on, however, because the quorum was invalidated. President 
Frantz Robert Monde planned another meeting for this Thursday.

  [Text] The president of the Chamber of Deputies has taken 
some new steps to disentangle the situation. Frantz Robert Monde 
wrote to the U.S. President and the UN secretary general asking 
them to try to convince President Aristide to nominate a new 
prime minister in Haiti. It is the latest attempt at mediation 
from the president of the Lower Chamber, who indicates in his 
letter that any failure of this initiative would lead the 
parliament to fill the state vacuum. Here is a summary of the 
letters of President Monde to U.S. President Bill Clinton and to 
the UN secretary general, with Clarence Renois: 
  [Begin Renois recording] It is a new approach by the 
president of the Chamber of Deputies. Frantz Robert Monde 
specifically addressed the president of the United States. He 
began by criticizing the attitude of the Democratic congressmen 
of the Black Caucus who, according to him, desire a solution to 
the Haitian crisis, even if it involves weapons and genocide. 
The president of the Chamber of Deputies also deplored to the 
U.S. president the behavior of President Aristide who, according 
to him, is trying to provoke an upheaval among the officers of 
the Haitian Armed Forces, and who stubbornly refuses to nominate 
a new prime minister because it would favor the application of 
the legislators' plan. 
  Frantz Robert Monde, in writing, called on President 
Clinton's wisdom and clear-mindedness avoid the influence of the 
Black Caucus Democrats who, he says, are exploiting Haiti's 
crisis to pursue and defend their own interests. Frantz Robert 
Monde also pleaded with the president of the United States in 
favor of a national solution to the Haitian crisis. Only 
negotiations among Haitians, and the unemotional support of the 
international community can save what can still be saved in 
Haiti. 
  The president of the Chamber also addressed the UN secretary 
general, soliciting his support in prompting Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide to nominate a prime minister. I call on your humanism 
and your high sense of morality, writes Frantz Robert Monde, who 
foresees, and I quote: If the United States does not succeed in 
convincing the president-in-exile to fill the political vacuum, 
the parliament will be left with a last resort, recognizing the 
persistent refusal of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to obey 
the Constitution's provisions. 
  Following the consultations in Port-au-Prince, here is now 
the president of the Chamber of Deputies involving himself in a 
new approach, this time with the international community, 
specifically the world's highest authorities in order to find a 
solution to the crisis. It is only after consultations with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali 
that Frantz Robert Monde will consider applying the articles of 
the Constitution to emerge from the political deadlock. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde is 
dismayed by the numerous steps taken by several U.S. sectors to 
find a solution to the Haitian crisis. In a letter to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, Bob Monde conveyed his disappointment 
with the Democratic congressmen's attitude of the Black Caucus, 
who want to impose -- even through genocide and force of arms -- 
a so-called solution to the Haitian crisis. 
  In his letter to President Clinton, the president of the 
Chamber of Deputies points out President Aristide's obvious 
tendency toward provoking an upheaval within the command staff 
of the Haitian Armed Forces by soliciting on the very day of his 
installation [7 February 1991] the dismissal of the entire 
military command of that time and by demanding five months later 
the resignation -- under pressure -- of the commander in chief 
of the Army, General Herard Abraham who was replaced by Gen. 
Raoul Cedras. Cedras was appointed provisionally, something 
that the Constitution does not provide for, Monde points out. 
  While looking for a solution that can put an end to the 
distress of the Haitian people before the accelerated 
deterioration of their living conditions, the office of the 
Chamber of Deputies initiated a series of consultations with the 
various sectors in order to fill the institutional vacuum 
created by the departure of Robert Malval, Bob Monde further 
states. It is no longer time for war, writes Bob Monde, but for 
peace, the noble objective for which the United Nations was 
created. 
  In conclusion Robert Monde says: I appeal to the wisdom and 
the clear-sightedness of the head of state of the most powerful 
country of the world so he does not let himself be influenced by 
those men who -- all things considered -- are exploiting the 
Haitian crisis, the anguish, and the misery of the Haitian 
people to seek and defend their own interests. Thus concludes 
the letter Chamber President Frantz Robert Monde sent to U.S. 
President William Jefferson Clinton.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 5 May (EFE) -- Haitian parliament 
President Frantz Robert Monde has asked the United States and 
the United Nations to pressure ousted Haitian President Jean 
Bertrand Aristide to appoint a prime minister, otherwise the 
deputies will fill the void in the executive branch. 
  Monde's request, contained in letters sent to President Bill 
Clinton and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, was 
disclosed in Haiti on Wednesday. This is one day after the 
United States presented the UN Security Council a draft 
resolution for a total trade embargo against Haiti to pressure 
the military to give up power. Monde indicated to Clinton and 
Butrus-Ghali that he favors negotiations between Haiti to save 
whatever is left of the nation. He also asked Clinton not to be 
influenced by members of what he called "the black caucus" in 
the U.S. Congress because they are defending their own interests 
through the Haitian crisis. 
  Meanwhile on Wednesday, a group of deputies analyzed 
President Clinton's warning to the military coupists to 
relinquish power. Duly Brutus, from the Progressive Nationalist 
and Revolutionary Haitian party, socialist in leaning, said the 
best way to avoid the loss of sovereignty is to request General 
Raoul Cedras, Armed Forces chief, to fulfill his promise to 
resign -- in keeping with the agreement signed at Governor's 
Island in New York in 1993. 
  Nevertheless, other deputies, such as Pierre Francois Vital, 
have proposed the appointment of a temporary prime minister by 
parliament until Aristide designates one, as provided for in the 
Constitution. 
  Legislator Joseph Lambert suggested Aristide be asked to 
order the Armed Forces to take a position to defend the country 
in light of possible U.S. military intervention. Lambert said 
that if Aristide does not issue this order, he will be blamed 
for the U.S. intervention and tried for it. 
  Senator Bernard Sansaricq reiterated his petition that 
Constitutional Article No. 149 be implemented, and that Supreme 
Court President Emile Jonassaint be appointed temporary 
president. 
  In addition to the critical political situation, two 
sympathizers of deposed President Aristide were arrested 
arbitrarily in Port-au-Prince at the end of April. The OAS-UN 
civilian mission, which is in Haiti supervising the human rights 
situation, denounced these arrests. 
  The international mission expressed "great concern" over 
these arbitrary arrests and the illegal detentions, and asked 
the Armed Forces to respect legal dispositions regarding human 
rights and the mental integrity of individuals. 
  The wave of violence heightened in the past hours when the 
body of Jean Verdy Bastien, head of a lottery company, renowned 
businessman, and owner of the "Celeste F.M" radio station, was 
found. Bastien, a wealthy businessman who was linked to 
political groups opposed to President Aristide, was shot to 
death in Port-au-Prince the night of 4 May. The motive for this 
murder remains unknown. 
  In April, five employees of another lottery company were 
also 
shot to death under circumstances still unknown. Today, local 
media reported that on 4 May, three bodies riddled with bullets 
were found in various areas of the country.

  [Text] Senator Bernard Sansaricq says he is against any 
form of armed intervention in the crisis. In the opinion of the 
president of the unofficial office of the upper chamber, who 
calls for the formation of a competent government aimed at 
getting the country out of the deadlock, the solution must be 
Haitian. The Clinton administration is divided as to the 
strategy to adopt concerning the Haitian crisis, according to 
Sansaricq, who claims Republican support for implementation of 
Article 149. The statements by former U.S. President George Bush 
bear witness to that. 
  Article 149 is the only solution to the crisis, according to 
Sen. Sansaricq, who condemns possible reinforcement of the 
sanctions on top of an already difficult situation. The embargo 
has already caused irreparable damage to the country: 50,000 
deaths, according to the Grand'Anse senator, who appeals to the 
conscience and patriotism of the Haitian head of state for the 
lifting of the sanctions. Let us listen to Bernard Sansaricq. 
  [Begin Sansaricq recording, in Creole] There may be a 
military intervention in Haiti. This has been requested by 
several U.S. senators and several members of the Black Caucus in 
the United States. It is with this objective... [pauses] For 
example, the recent visit to Haiti of Reverend Thomas Ferguson, 
who is a Black Caucus member from the Republican Party, clearly 
indicates that there are several sectors within the U.S. 
Government; there are sectors, especially the Republican Party, 
that support what we are doing in the Senate of the Republic. 
  President Bush made a statement yesterday. What he said was 
very eloquent. He told President Clinton: Let Haiti be Haiti. 
[previous four words in English] Let Haiti be what it is, let 
Haitians find the solution to the problem by themselves. Let us 
Haitians take the necessary steps to solve the problem by 
ourselves. [end recording]

  [Text] Federal Judicial Police [PJF] arrested an alleged 
drug trafficker in Tijuana, Baja California, for trying to take 
317.2 kg of cocaine base to the United States. The drug would 
have been worth $30 million on the international market. 
  The PJF conducted three operations in Guerrero, Morelos, and 
Tijuana, seizing approximately two kg of pure heroin. 
Operations in four other states resulted in the seizure of 62 
kg of ephedrine and 1,024 kg of marijuana. In other operations 
conducted in seven states, 31 alleged drug traffickers were 
arrested and 13 vehicles confiscated. 
  The Attorney General's Office [PGR] reported that PJF 
members, on duty at the checkpoint in (Precos) in Benjamin Hill 
Municipality along the Tijuana border with the Unites States, 
forced a truck driver who was hauling lumber to stop for 
inspection. 
  The policemen carefully checked the vehicle inside and out 
and discovered a false bottom in which they found dozens of 
packages wrapped in plastic. Upon removing the plastic, they 
found that the packages contained pure cocaine weighing a total 
of 317.2 kg. 
  Ramon Lopez Salazar, the truck driver, was taken to the PGR 
and charged with crimes against public health. The driver said 
he had picked up the drug in Ciudad Obregon, Sonora and was 
instructed to take it to the town of Progreso, Baja California, 
from where it would be smuggled into California in the United 
States. The PGR said that if the 317.2 kg of pure cocaine had 
entered the drug market, it would have put some 5 million fixes 
into circulation. 
<H5>  Seizures in Seven States; 31 Alleged Drug Traffickers </H5>
Arrested 
  The PJF has seized nearly 2 kg of pure heroin, 62 kg of 
ephedrine, and one ton and 24 kg of marijuana in various 
operations in seven states. Police arrested 31 alleged drug 
traffickers and confiscated 13 vehicles. 
  In Guerrero, the PJF found 810 grams of heroin hidden 
between 
shoe boxes and car tires at a residence in Petatlan 
Municipality. Additionally, they arrested brothers Bartolo and 
Alejo Villasenor and Valente Nunez Cardenas. In Morelos, four 
alleged drug traffickers in possession of 613 grams of heroin 
were arrested. 
  A woman was arrested at Tijuana International Airport for 
having three packages containing 590 grams of heroin adhered to 
her body. According to the PGR, the drug was detected by a 
"narcotics dog." The woman told personnel at the Federal 
Prosecutor's Office that she received the drug from an 
individual in Caleta de Campos, Lazaro Cardenas Municipality, 
Michoacan, who paid her 500 nuevos pesos to take it to Tijuana. 
  Another four people were arrested in various operations in 
Tijuana. Authorities seized a total of 62 kg and 460 grams of 
the chemical precursor ephedrine, 181 kg and 280 grams of 
marijuana, and two trucks from them. 
  Meanwhile, a truck driver transporting 274 kg of marijuana 
inside his vehicle was arrested at a residence located at the 
km-17.5 marker on the road to San Felipe Ensenada, Baja 
California. 
  The PJF apprehended a bus driver from the Omnibus of Mexico 
line and his escort on the Durango-Parral road in the town of 
Morcillo, Durango. The report added that 107 kg of marijuana 
was inside the bus. 
  An individual who was promised $2,500 to transport 150 kg of 
marijuana to Vallecillo, Nuevo Laredo, was arrested in Nuevo 
Laredo, Tamaulipas. Two people were arrested in El 
Precos,located at the km-163 marker of the Mexico City-Laredo 
road, Linares-Hualahuises stretch. Officials seized 121 kg and 
500 grams from these two individuals, who were accompanied by 
two children. 
  Several operations in Baja California Sur resulted in the 
seizure of 84 kg and 500 grams of marijuana and a vehicle and 
the arrest of three alleged drug traffickers.

  [Text] Mexico City, 5 May (EFE) -- Today, a source at the 
Attorney General's Office [PGR] reported that Mexican 
authorities have seized a little more than 400 kg of cocaine 
paste and confiscated an aircraft that flew from Cali, Colombia, 
to the Cancun International Airport. 
  The drugs were discovered in a building at the airport, near 
the aircraft whose range and speed, according to the PGR, make 
it ideal for transporting drugs. For this reason, the plane was 
confiscated and its two crewmen detained. 
  The authorities estimate that, considering price 
fluctuations 
and the quality of the drugs seized, the load would have yielded 
close to 6 million doses and would have had a market value of 
$50 million. The authorities said an investigation has been 
opened to determine the exact origin of the drugs and the 
involved of the plane's crew. 
  The PGR has reported that so far this year approximately 7.5 
metric tons of cocaine have been confiscated in various actions 
throughout the country.

  [Text] Mexico, Federal District, 4 May (EFE) -- Mexican 
Judicial Police have seized 5.8 tons of marijuana worth $36 
million, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office (PGR) 
reported on Wednesday. 
  The operation was conducted in La Paz, capital of Baja 
California Sur State, some 1,250 kms northeast of Mexico City. 
According to the information available, the seizure was made at 
a La Paz loading terminal during the inspection of a trailer 
that had come from the port of Mazatlan, Sinaloa State, one of 
the states with the highest incidence of narcotrafficking. 
According to the driver, the truck was bound for the 
California, (United States) border, where the drug would have a 
commercial value of $36 million. 
  The PGR is holding the truckdriver pending a decision on any 
penal action against him for crimes against the public health. 
It has also begun investigating the prisoner's plan and 
possible accomplices as well as the place of origin and the 
destination of the stupefacient.

<F P=106> [Message to the Nation by President Carlos Salinas de </F>
Gortari at Los Pinos Presidential Residence in Mexico City on 4 
May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow Mexicans: In recent months, Mexico has faced 
some events which have hurt us as well as others that have 
saddened and angered us. All of these events have shocked the 
Mexican people, and this is why I want to talk to you so we can 
reflect on this together and so I can convey my feelings to you 
about these events -- events that have forced us to come 
together and decisively act in favor of the nation. 
  I know the Mexican people are convinced that violence is not 
the way to resolve differences, remedy difficulties, or promote 
personal or group interests. The path we have embarked upon is 
one of dialogue and solidarity, and it is one that will not be 
interrupted. I am committed to complying with the laws and to 
fighting violence, specifically impunity, kidnapping, and drug 
trafficking. All of these forms of violence have caused great 
damage to other countries, and they seek to harm our nation as 
well. This is why this is the best time to reassert our 
commitment to Mexico. 
  To combat the threats of criminals and organized gangs 
against public security, I have created a Coordinating Board 
that falls within the jurisdiction of the president of the 
republic. Through this new organization, we will redouble the 
efficiency of the Attorney General's Office to fight crime. As 
head of this organization, I have appointed -- by virtue of the 
powers bestowed on me by Article 89 of the Constitution -- a 
very prominent and experienced jurist with a clear determination 
to implement the law. 
  In light of incidents that seek to generate fear and 
mistrust, the state's response is overwhelming. No one should 
question our firm resolve to enforce the law vis-a-vis criminals 
and gangs. The greatest problem, however, lies in existing 
divisions, baseless conjectures, and discouragement, which is 
precisely what the criminals want. Our response must be clear, 
firm, and committed or we will place peace and the de jure state 
at a disadvantage. In the face of rumors and uncertainty, we 
will brandish truth and information. 
  The government is adapting and will continue to adapt to the 
de jure state as the primary mechanism for justice and peaceful 
coexistence. We will continue waging a battle against gangs and 
drug trafficking in all forms and against impunity with greater 
strength and efficiency. We will also continue waging a battle 
with all the rigor of the law and the strength of our national 
unity against these criminals who constitute Mexico's true 
enemies. We also will make the greatest efforts possible in 
seeking a peaceful solution to the Chiapas conflict. We will 
keep our promises, and we will continue giving all our support 
to the peace commissioner. The murder of Colosio will not go 
unpunished. The special assistant prosecutor has my complete 
support to conduct a thorough investigation to enable the 
judicial branch to find those who are responsible. 
  We will continue legally and untiringly opposing those who 
stir up violence in Mexico. This campaign requires respect for 
decisions made by our courts, because only they can issue 
sentences and impose penalties on lawbreakers. Only our courts 
can punish those who violate our rights. Moreover, justice does 
not permit sentencing without due process or retaliation. 
  Fellow Mexicans, In light of the recent violent events, we, 
the Mexican people, cannot and should not forget the many 
positive events, actions, and circumstances that, in recent 
years, have transformed Mexico into a nation characterized by 
greater opportunities, international respect, and, in 
particular, greater justice for the Mexican people. This will 
undoubtedly be the best legacy we will be leaving for future 
generations. As a result, we must persevere with the changes 
proposed and keep making progress in the areas of respect and 
dignity of individuals, Indian groups, communities, and citizens 
in general. 
  In response to the question of what we will do, I believe 
all 
Mexicans are already doing something. For instance, we have 
intensified dialogue -- the one taking place between the 
government secretary and the political parties is a case in 
point -- and we will keep transforming our pluralism into 
strength and our differences into starting points for new 
democratic encounters. We will continue promoting closer ties 
between authorities and communities and work to reduce the 
pitfalls that those who oppose Mexico's progress want to 
exploit. We will consolidate our economic efforts to create 
more opportunities. We will continue implementing measures to 
accelerate the economic recovery and, in particular, we will 
continue investing, timely and efficiently, those resources 
earmarked for social expenditures. 
  These expenditures are the highest they have ever been. 
They are expenditures that support the people, communities, and 
families -- the most valuable things in our nation. I know the 
economic situation worries families. I will increase the 
determination and the efforts to open more economic 
opportunities that you need. There will be more actions in 
favor of the people's economy [economia popular]. To stimulate 
the countryside, we will continue providing direct support to 
Procampo [Program of Direct Support to the Countryside], which 
helps more than 3 million peasants who work the majority of the 
country's cultivated land. With Procede [expansion unknown], we 
will continue to issue the title deeds that hundreds of 
thousands of ejido holders demand and have a right to in the 
country. 
  To increase wellbeing, we will continue spending more -- 
more 
than ever before in our history -- on education. This year, we 
will invest more than 6 percent of the GNP, which is the highest 
proportion in the century, in favor of our children's education. 
We will continue to support our teachers with tangible 
measures. In the health sector, we are protecting more 
Mexicans, eliminating diseases that affect our children and 
vaccinating all of them. Above all, we are doing so with higher 
quality efforts and a sense of service. 
  We will build nearly 340,000 houses, a number that has never 
before been built in a single year and which is more than 
one-fourth of all the houses built in the past 60 years. We 
have expanded credit facilities for small and medium-sized 
businesses which create countless jobs and which are so 
important to us. We are doubling the number of scholarships, to 
reach the level of 200,000, for the training of workers and 
those who are unemployed at this time. In this way, 200,000 
Mexicans will obtain an income and improve their training and 
preparation to take advantage of the opportunities created by 
new jobs. We are strengthening the 130 regional solidarity 
funds to finance productive projects in approximately 4,000 
Indian communities. 
  Fellow Mexicans, We are going to continue working for 
Mexico, 
as is our duty, as is everyone's duty. We are mainly going to 
redouble public security, without limiting democracy or freedom. 
We will continue to oppose violence with the force of law and 
with the values that unite us and give us a future. In the face 
of attacks, we will employ unity, legality, and each 
individual's commitment to Mexico. In the face of injustice, we 
will employ the resolute action of the entire nation in favor of 
those who have less. In the face of insult, we will employ our 
essential unity as Mexicans. Who benefits from rumors? Who 
benefits from confusion? Certainly not the republic's 
institutions, not the country's democratic forces, not 
tolerance, and not those who peacefully struggle for justice. We 
do not accept the use of misinformation against Mexico. 
  No action can change our determined resolve to respect 
freedom of speech or criticism. An excess of this freedom will 
always be better than placing limits on it. I reiterate that we 
promote unity not to silence dissenting voices but, rather, to 
unite resolve to strengthen institutions in a harmonious 
alliance of all Mexicans. Of course, this is not the first nor 
will it be the last difficult period we will face. Still, the 
ties among the Mexicans are great and strong. Our determination 
to move ahead and resolve our challenges one by one remains 
firm. Our desire remains firm to continue as a whole nation 
progressing in peace, with freedom, and more justice. We will 
close ranks and redouble our steps; this will be our response in 
the face of attempts to block Mexico's progress. That is what I 
have heard from the voices of many Mexicans, legislators, 
different sectors, the various political parties, and the 
population in general in my regular tours throughout the 
country. I have in me all of the enthusiasm and energy to 
fulfill my duty of serving Mexicans. 
  Fellow countrymen, This is our most important and 
significant 
principle -- firm dignity and unalterable strength -- which make 
us proud as a people and defines us as a nation. Without a 
doubt, Mexico will come out stronger, with more freedom, 
democracy, justice, and reaffirmed sovereignty. This is what we 
will do because this is what we learned from the generations 
that preceded us, and because this is, without a doubt, the best 
lesson and example we can give our children and grandchildren. 
  Fellow countrymen, Viva Mexico!

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Flores in Baja California; from the "ACIR </F>
Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Unidentified announcer, at the Radio ACIR studios 
in Mexico City] At noon, we reported on a news conference by 
Sergio Ortiz Lara -- now under arrest -- a news conference he 
gave as the deputy prosecutor of Baja California, not as a 
prison inmate. Ortiz Lara was arrested last night on charges 
linked to drug trafficking, the 3 March shootout, and the 
release of two people involve in this shootout. He is also 
accused of administrative crimes. At 1400, Baja California 
Governor Ernesto Ruffo also held a news conference. Jaime 
Flores, can you tell us what he said? 
  [Flores] Governor Ernesto Ruffo's news conference ended not 
more than five minutes ago. He came from the capital to meet 
with the press and give his views on Sergio Ortiz Lara's arrest 
yesterday, as you have already noted. Mr. Ruffo said he 
considers the Federal Attorney General's Office as being 
completely politically irresponsible in the way it has handled 
these conjectures. Ruffo said the arrest is based solely on 
theory and not on hard facts. In a sense, he supports Sergio 
Ortiz Lara. 
  Ruffo has asked the federal government for more transparency 
and openness in its actions. He said that coordination -- as 
required between state institutions and the federal government 
-- must exist in incidents such as this. I questioned Mr. Ruffo 
during the news conference on the statements made this morning 
by Sergio Ortiz Lara. Ortiz Lara had indicated that these 
actions not only harm the Attorney General's Office, but they 
also harm other federal institutions and Ernesto Ruffo's 
government. In this regard, Ruffo said openness and 
transparency were needed, and he added that the government needs 
to avoid conjectures or empty theories because it cannot operate 
under such conditions. Ruffo said authoritarianism is not the 
way such issues should be handled. He added that on this 
occasion the authorities had fallen into authoritarianism. 
  In conclusion, he said -- after I had asked him whether this 
problem had become imminently political in nature -- that the 
current situation of confrontation will prevent democracy from 
progressing. The truth is that one must not act on conjectures. 
He said that soon he will try to meet personally with President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari and with Government Secretary Jorge 
Cartizo. 
  He also said that, from his point of view, there is no 
relation between Sergio Ortiz's arrest and the murder of 
Municipal Security Director Federico Benitez. As everyone 
knows, Benitez was gunned down last Thursday at La Mesa while 
travelling with this bodyguard in an official vehicle. The 
state governor does not agree with the Federal Attorney 
General's Office handling of Ortiz Lara's arrest. He said this 
action is based on conjectures and not on hard facts. 
  He also said the matter of Cristine's disco, which was 
mentioned by Attorney General Diego Valades, is nothing more 
than speculation because there is no specific information 
involving Sergio Ortiz Lara. 
  Unofficially, I would like to tell you that it has been 
learned that an arrest warrant has been issued against former 
Prosecutor Juan Francisco Franco Rios. As I already mentioned, 
he is considered responsible for having sold identification 
credentials to drug traffickers, in this case, to criminals who 
were killed at Cristine's during the shootout. 
  [Announcer] What party is Juan Francisco Franco linked to? 
  [Flores] Juan Francisco Franco Rios was, up intil two weeks 
ago, justice prosecutor. Of course, he belongs to the PAN 
[National Action Party] administration. This incident occurred 
barely one year after Ernesto Ruffo became governor. He has 
always been linked to drug trafficking matters. This 
information I am giving you is unofficial, although we will try 
to confirm it. A tight lid has been placed on this case. 
Deputy Prosecutor Sergio Ortiz Lara depended on former Justice 
Prosecutor Juan Francisco Franco Rios. This news is unofficial. 
It is very suspicious that just over a week ago, he left his 
post and now no one know his whereabouts. The current 
prosecutor is Pedro Vidal Rosas. 
  [Announcer] Furthermore, Jaime -- please allow me to make a 
comment and remind our listeners of this -- I read a report two 
weeks ago in which the governor of Baja California referred to 
rumors linking his brother to drug trafficking. He said that if 
this were true he would put his brother in jail. Now we are 
hearing that, according to investigations and the events of the 
past few days, there is an apparent connection between members 
of PAN -- and, remember, this assertion is not mine -- and drug 
trafficking, which has also been linked to the arrest of Baja 
California Assistant Attorney General Sergio Ortiz Lara. You 
also pointed out and wondered whether this is not becoming a 
political or partisan issue and whether both sides -- government 
officials and the PAN -- should be called upon to fully adhere 
to the law. 
  [Flores] Well, reporter Ana Patricia asked Mr. Ruffo about 
that very same thing. His answer was this: Oh, the famous 
Claudio. He said it jokingly; he was smiling and calm. He said 
the only thing he knows about his brother is that he owes a debt 
to the Finance Secretariat involving some property he owns in a 
small town called Rosarito, 30 km south of Tijuana. He says his 
brother Claudio Ruffo's problems are exclusively under the 
jurisdiction of the Finance Secretariat, to which he owes an 
unspecified amount of money, and he admitted that his brother is 
living on the other side of the border. He said, however, that 
he is not aware of any lawsuit against Claudio, adding that 
action should be taken against his brother or anyone else 
charged with drug trafficking. Ruffo added that he has 18 more 
months in office and that his goal is to combat crime. This is 
exactly what Mr. Ruffo said about his brother.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary </F>
Committee General Command of the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army from the mountains of southeastern Mexico in Chiapas State 
on 1 May] 
  [Text] Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee General 
Command of the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN], 
Mexico, 1 May 1994. 
  To the Mexican people: 
  To the peoples and governments of the world: 
  To the national and international media: 
  Brethren: 
  The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee General 
Command of the EZLN addresses the following message to you: 
  Today, 1 May 1994, we once again commemorate Labor Day. 
Throughout the world, rural and urban workers celebrate their 
rebellion against exploitation and reaffirm their hope for a 
more just world. In Mexico, Labor Day is a day of struggle. 
Since that day, when the bad government which now oppresses us 
from the Zocalo in Mexico City deprived the Flores Magons of 
their just aspirations, chains have been dragging down the best 
Mexican workers. False and corrupt leaders, some more than nine 
decades old, traffic with the Mexican workers' pain. They are 
the mainstay of the supreme government that is now peddling our 
history and our land for foreign currency. The workers struggle 
for organizational independence has exposed the triple alliance 
of bad government, corrupt leaders, and the rich and powerful. 
  The enjoyment of ill-gotten gains now has a new name tag. 
Another mask hides our pain from our own eyes, and a new name 
unites injustice, slavery, and usurpation -- neoliberalism. 
  The workers who build our country are bleeding from three 
wounds: they are bled by the powerful through unfair salaries, 
humiliations, and threats. They are bled by the traitors who 
run the government's large central unions through extortions, 
beatings, and death. They are bled by the turncoats who, in the 
offices they have usurped, draft the laws that their treachery 
dictates. 
  Thrice the worker dies in the mill of our nation's history: 
he dies of poverty because he is not justly paid for his new 
tasks. He dies of humiliation because his defiant words are 
silenced by the treachery of those who claim to be like him. He 
dies of slavery because the bad government ignores his will and 
his determination. 
  Thrice the Mexican worker fights on dirt and asphalt: he 
fights for justice to have bread and truth in his house and on 
his table. He also fights for the freedom of his words and deeds 
so his children will not inherit his shame. He fights for 
democracy because in his power to change matters lies his power 
to govern and uphold self-government. 
  The future we all want for our entire nation has three 
lives: 
The life of its own strength derived from those brothers whose 
work is recognized. The life of its hand in the hand of a 
peasant worker. The life of its embrace that encircles our 
entire people so that we can march together down a new and 
better path. 
  Thrice the faceless worker lives and dies. Faceless, 
uncleansed by the hunger that stains him. Faceless, prey to the 
treason that destroys him. And faceless because his will is 
unfulfilled. 
  Thrice he dies, thrice he fights, and thrice he lives. 
Thrice walks the faceless worker who creates the nation's 
wealth and makes it tangible, measurable, and changeable. 
  Brothers: 
  From a similar but different history, another faceless being 
looks on this day with hope: from the mountains in the farthest 
corner of Mexico, a faceless hope, whose step is merely a tender 
voice and fire, salutes the workers. 
  The false masks that are plundering us today must fall three 
times, the unjust labor and pay must fall. The treason that 
leaves us speechless must fall. And the government that breaks 
our resolve must fall. 
  Justice! Liberty! Democracy! These are the three keys to 
the three chains. Justice in the right to a dignified and 
well-paid job. Freedom in the right to organize ourselves 
independently of powerful men and their spokesmen. Democracy in 
the right to demand that the government must obey its mandate. 
  This is what we, the meekest people in these lands, are 
asking for. We want only this: three rights; three struggles; 
three suns. And one tomorrow: that of a new Mexico. 
  Mexican workers of the cities and the countryside, Let your 
voices be heard next to ours. Let your shouts be heard loud and 
strong throughout this land. Take this hand that your meekest 
brother offers you. Three forces should walk as one: the 
workers' force, the peasants' force, and the peoples' force. 
With these three forces nothing can stop us. 
  Already our blood is being lost in history. The brother of 
the industrial world cannot let his peasant brother die of 
shame. Let all people unite as one. May the curse that divides 
us never again darken our skies. 
  Listen to our voice although it comes from afar. Hail! You 
toilers of the sea and tillers of the land! The Zapatists join 
you in your struggle! With you, there will someday be a 
homeland and a future for us all. Without you, darkness will 
continue to rule these lands! Liberty! Justice! Democracy! 
  Respectfully: 
  [Signed] The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee 
General Command of the EZLN. General Headquarters; the 
mountains of southeastern Mexico; Chiapas, Mexico. 
  [Issued] 1 May 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Lourdes Sierra Arenas] </F>
  [Text] The Labor Commission for North America began 
operations with two lawsuits, one against a General Electric 
[GE] assembly plant and the other against the Honnewey [name as 
published] Company, both located in Chihuahua State. The suits 
accuse the companies of firing 110 workers for attempting to 
unionize and of not paying "back wages". 
  These are the first two cases that have arisen following the 
implementation of NAFTA. The two aforementioned companies 
violated the norms established in the Labor Agreement for North 
America signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, which 
acknowledges full respect and protection of workers rights and 
laws in each country, said Berta Lujan, secretary general of the 
Mexican Network for Action on NAFTA. 
  At a news conference, Lujan said the charges filed with the 
Commission, which is presided over by the labor ministers of 
each country, were presented in December and investigations are 
now under way to determine to what extent Mexican workers' 
rights were violated. The organization is expected to reveal 
the results of its study in three months. The plaintiffs 
responsible for taking this lawsuit to the trilateral 
organization headquartered in Dallas, Texas, are the United 
Electrical Workers and the Teamsters Union, who are supported by 
the Network, Lujan said. 
  The GE assembly plant fired 70 workers, while the Honnewey 
Company fired 40 workers. The charges were filed to obtain the 
workers' reinstatement, to force the payment of "back wages," 
and to demand respect for the right to unionize. 
  For their part, Andres Penaloza, Victor Osorio, and 
Alejandro 
Villamar, also members of the Network, expressed the need to 
include labor and environmental protection norms in the trade 
agreements Mexico is negotiating with Central and South American 
countries so there will be protection of natural resources as 
well as of workers rights. They believe that with the signing 
of these trade agreements, which in the case of Mexico and Costa 
Rica already has been signed, our country is looking for a 
solution for those companies that will not be able to compete 
against the United States. Markets will be won by "striking" 
and substituting small producers in those countries. 
  Within this context, Andres Penaloza, coordinator of the 
NAFTA Follow-up Commission, said the Network is developing 
several proposals for renegotiating NAFTA, which will be 
presented to the nation's presidential candidates.

    [Editorial Report] Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in 
Spanish 0000 GMT 26 Apr 94 reports that Labor Party [PT] 
presidential candidate Cecilia Soto explained her platform 
during Radio ACIR's "Panorama Newscast." She stated the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], National Action Party 
[PAN], and the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] "share 
the obsolescence and fatigue of the Mexican political system." 
Commenting on PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo's 
invitation to his PRD and PAN rivals to hold a debate, she 
regrets her exclusion and adds that it breaks slain PRI 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio's promise that the debate would 
include all candidates. When describing what her cabinet would 
look like if she were elected, Soto says the country must have 
"true" experts in their fields. She adds that her cabinet would 
include members of other parties and several women. On the topic 
of the Federal Judicial Police, Soto advocates abolishing this

  [Excerpt] We are going to repeat the communique sent to 
YSKL by the Salvadoran Revolutionary Front [FRS], which has 
issued death threats against former guerrilla commanders Ana 
Guadalupe Martinez, Joaquin Villalobos, and Eduardo Sancho. We 
will read the text of the communique and then we will have the 
reaction of former guerrilla commander Joaquin Villalobos about 
the FRS death threats. 
  This is the text of the communique: In view of the FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] actions in the 
Legislative Assembly, the FRS states: 
  1. The attitude of the deputies of the ERP [Peoples 
Revitalizing Expression] and the National Resistance in selling 
out to ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] in the first vote 
in the Legislative Assembly is a dishonorable action of high 
treason. 
  2. We praise the truly revolutionary attitude of the 
Communist Party, the Revolutionary Party of Central American 
Workers [PRTC], and the Peoples Liberation Forces [FPL] for 
refusing to share the Legislative Assembly's Board of Directors 
with the party of the death squads. It would be dishonorable 
and corrupt for any leader to try to sit on that board. 
  3. We believe the attitude adopted by these gentlemen at 
this 
time and all the repercussions of their treasons, such as the 
case of the El Espino farm, the purge of the Armed Forces, their 
rejection and insults against Marxism-Leninism and revolutionary 
ideas, are very grave offenses against the revolution and the 
unity of the revolutionary forces. 
  4. It is hoped that the FMLN leadership will adopt an 
exemplary revolutionary position and will punish this grave 
transgression in its ranks with the quick and final expulsion of 
the ERP and National Resistance leaders. If this is not done and 
the issue is treated lightly, revolutionary ranks would be 
corrupted and it would be guilty of complicity. 
  In view of the above, the FRS decrees the death penalty is 
applicable to the members of the leadership of the National 
Resistance and the Peoples Revolutionary Army, now called the 
ERP, led by Joaquin Villalobos, Eduardo Sancho, Ana Guadalupe 
Martinez, and the rest of the traitors. We announce that we 
have already ordered our commando units to execute the orders 
against all the ERP and National Resistance leaders. 
  [Signed] FRS, 5 May 1994 
  We have former commander Joaquin Villalobos on the line to 
give us his opinion about the death sentences issued by the FRS 
because of the position adopted by the ERP and the National 
Resistance on Sunday, when the Legislative Assembly Board of 
Directors was elected. The two groups supported the ruling 
ARENA in these elections. Good evening commander, go ahead: 
  [Villalobos] I have just learned of this. I can tell you 
that this is the result of the encouragement of fanatical 
positions. We have been insisting to other companeros that to 
use the word traitor, to make moral judgments, to polarize the 
situation as they have been doing, or to employ the type of 
attacks they have been employing would open the doors to a 
situation in which this type of thing would occur. 
  I do not know whether this comes from the left or the right. 
From wherever it comes, it is evidently something that has taken 
shape or is the result of political positions and the way in 
which the debate has been turned by the companeros of the FPL, 
PRTC, and the Communist Party. This is a very irrational and 
rash position of confrontation that runs counter to dialogue. 
All media have reported this as a very aggressive, 
confrontational, enraged, and angry position. Everyone saw the 
upside-down photographs, with the cross on the top, and the 
pamphlets decrying the traitors. For me, this threat is a 
logical consequence. Nevertheless, I tell you that we are not 
worried. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Guatemala City, 5 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Guatemalan 
Government today insisted [words indistinct] the warnings of 
danger to tourists who travel to the country because this might 
produce at least $5 million in losses this year. 
  The travel warning for Guatemala was imposed by the U.S. 
Government in response to a wave of violence in recent weeks. 
  Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys Marithza Ruiz de Vielman 
said the travel warning for U.S. tourists "does not help 
Guatemalan efforts to promote development, strengthen democracy, 
and move toward peace." 
  Ruiz de Vielman regretted she has not received a reply from 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to a letter sent by 
Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio on 15 April. In the 
letter, De Leon Carpio promised severe measures against those 
who commit violent actions and create a climate of instability 
for the population and especially for U.S. tourists. The 
president explained that Guatemala [words indistinct] tourists a 
year, making the tourist industry the second greatest source of 
foreign exchange for the country. 
  The greatest number of tourists come from the United States. 
Last year, 147,262 U.S. tourists visited Guatemala. According 
to Guatemalan Tourism Institute Director Bruno Mertins, that 
figure represents 26 percent of the total number of visitors. 
Mertins said that tourism produced [words indistinct] in 1993, 
$9.1 million more than in 1992, although the prospects for 1994 
are not very encouraging. Tourism revenue is only surpassed by 
coffee exports which bring $275 million annually in foreign 
exchange. This amount is only slightly higher than the 
remittance of money from Guatemalans living in the United 
States, which amounts to approximately $200 million. 
  Authorities say they are investigating the reasons for the 
attacks on U.S. tourists in March in Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa 
in the south, San Cristobal Verapaz in the north, and 
Huehuetenango in the west. 
  According to official studies in the tourism industry, which 
provides 70,000 direct jobs, this sector has been the one most 
hurt by the wave of violence. Mertins said that because of the 
violence AID suspended assistance it had earmarked for the 
tourism sector. 
  Hotels, travel agencies, and tourism operators are 
undertaking campaigns in various U.S. cities to counteract the 
negative reports as a result of attacks on U.S. tourists. 
  U.S. citizen Chris Halter, director of the Christian 
Foundation for Respect of Indians, said that if by 15 May the 
State Department does not lift the travel warning, he will go on 
a hunger strike in front of the U.S. Embassy. On 11 May, a 
group of Indians who are led by Halter and who earn their living 
from the sale of handicrafts will stage a march to the U.S. 
Embassy to protest the travel warning for U.S. tourists.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Alejandro Bolanos Davis] </F>
  [Text] Many of us have wondered, and still others continue 
to wonder, why Dona Violeta cannot get Humberto Ortega out of 
the Army. If she is president of the Republic, why is it 
impossible for her to remove him from office? 
  There are certainly many different answers to this question. 
I will give an answer that is based on the political 
Constitution that was tailor-made to suit the Sandinists' needs. 
  According to Article 144 of the Sandinists' political 
Constitution, the president of the Republic is the "commander in 
chief of the Defense and Security Forces of the Nation," but 
nowhere in the Constitution is there any other reference to 
these Defense and Security Forces of the Nation (FDSN). 
Therefore, the president of the Republic is the commander in 
chief of a nonexistent military force. 
  What does exist is the Sandinist People's Army (EPS), but 
the 
Constitution itself does not recognize it as the "Defense and 
Security Force of the Nation." Article 95 of the Constitution 
states: 
  "The Sandinist People's Army is a national force and shall 
protect, respect, and obey this political Constitution. 
  "The Sandinist People's Army is the military arm of the 
people and the direct heir of the National Sovereignty Defense 
Army. The government plans, organizes, and directs the people's 
participation in the armed defense of the fatherland through the 
Sandinist People's Army. No armed bodies other than those 
established by law shall exist in national territory, and the 
law shall regulate the organization of military forces." 
  The above makes it clear that: 
  1) The president of the Republic is the commander in chief 
of a nonexistent army, not of the EPS. 
  2) The EPS, the army of the Sandinists' party, is not the 
national army of Nicaragua, but it is a "national force" because 
it replaces the Defense and Security Forces of the Nation. 
  3) Only the EPS, the army of the Sandinists' political 
party, is allowed to exist in Nicaragua, and it is a national 
force because it has replaced the FDSN. 
  4) The EPS derives its power directly from the Army of 
Sandino, and arrogates to itself the exclusive power to organize 
the people's participation. 
  5) The EPS is independent of civilian power, in that it is 
not under the orders of the executive branch. 
  In short, the Sandinist political Constitution states that 
Dona Violeta cannot remove Humberto Ortega from office because 
she has no power over the commander of the EPS. 
  Antonio Lacayo, who devised and signed the famous Transition 
Protocol with Humberto Ortega, committing Dona Violeta's 
government to honoring the structure of the EPS and the 
Sandinist Constitution, complicated this situation even further. 
  In one paragraph, the Transition Protocol states: "Respect 
for the integrity and professionalism of the EPS and the forces 
of public order, as well as their ranks, personnel registries, 
and commands, in accordance with the Constitution and the laws 
of the Republic, is also the fundamental basis for the orderly 
transfer of government." 
  It is rumored that Humberto Ortega will retire from the EPS 
soon, but for reasons of political and economic convenience that 
have nothing to do with the executive branch. Before retiring, 
Ortega will make sure his successor is loyal to him and no one 
else, so that the EPS will continue to be an integral part of 
the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], a "national 
force." 
  Hence the urgent need for a constituent assembly to draft a 
new political constitution, with new deputies elected by the 
people, rather than partial amendments to the Constitution by 
the current Congress, with a majority of deputies favoring 
Sandinism. We will never free the country from the grip of the 
Sandinist military by merely amending the Constitution.

    [Editorial Report] Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish of 14 
April 1994 reports on page 4 that Sandinist National Liberation 
Front (FSLN) member Fernando Cardenal criticized the National 
Directorate (DN) for the actions it has taken since Chamorro 
took office. These include the lack of criticism of the pinata 
(the confiscation of property by FSLN leaders following the 
party's defeat in 1990). By not rejecting the pinata the DN was 
"discredited" in the eyes of the rank and file to the point that 
its subsequent actions were rendered ineffective. The DN also 
erred, Cardenal says, when it forced Sandinist Assembly members 
to elect the DN as a slate rather than by secret ballot prior to 
the first party congress in 1991, and when it refused to 
recognize the Assembly as the party's highest authority between 
congresses. Furthermore, the DN has ignored "the minimal and 
most basic ethical principles...and has been unable to prevent 
detractions, insults, and calumnies on the part of Sandinist 
militants." Cardenal refers to an interview by DN member Henry 
Ruiz who said in February that the FSLN secretary general makes 
decisions in lieu of collective decisionmaking by the 
Directorate so that "today there is no National Directorate but 
rather a leadership crisis." Cardenal hopes that his reflections 
will serve as a guide to participants in the FSLN extraordinary 
congress which will be held on 20 May.

    [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 15 April 
1994 on pages 1, 11 reports that FSLN [Sandinist National 
Liberation Front] leader Bayardo Arce no longer believes the 
FSLN will split at the extraordinary congress to be held in May. 
He says that, although he had noted in an interview he had given 
in March that a split was possible, the risk disappeared when 
the party united behind its opposition to the IMF agreement and 
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. Arce affirms that 
Sandinist factions also agree that the Sandinist Assembly is the 
party's highest authority between congresses and that candidates 
for the new National Directorate will come from the Assembly, 
which will be elected at the congress. The congress will also 
elect the secretary general and deputy secretary general, who 
will be chosen from the National Directorate. Arce believes out 
that fear of "caudillismo" will be laid to rest by "a clear 
definition of functions and collegial handling of 
responsibilities."

<F P=106> [Interview with FSLN National Directorate member Victor </F>
Tirado Lopez by Noel Irias; place and date not given; first five 
paragraphs are BARRICADA introduction] 
  [Text] Victor Tirado Lopez, member of the National 
Directorate of the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN), 
believes that economic issues are fundamental for the electoral 
future of his party. 
  He appealed for the formulation of economic proposals that 
go 
beyond momentary problems and set a course along which the 
Sandinists can take the country. 
  Regarding the internal situation of his party, Tirado stated 
that "the factions represent a more comprehensive 
democratization in the FSLN." 
  "No member of the National Directorate will remain aloof 
from 
these factions. Otherwise, we will be alone, isolated," he 
declared. 
  The Sandinist leader said that his participation in one of 
the factions of the FSLN will depend on how they deal with 
economic issues. 
  [Irias] Will the FSLN return to power? 
  [Tirado] Like all parties, we always aspire to take office, 
and to political power in general. The FSLN has great potential 
for running the Government of Nicaragua. 
  We need to meet a few requirements. To act as a 
revolutionary 
party that has committed itself to the defense of the workers' 
interests. 
  The current conditions are not the same as they were in 
1979; 
now there is a much wider array of parties in the opposition, 
contending with the FSLN to become the ruling party. 
  The FSLN will have to define three important strategic 
aspects of the current situation: the democratization of the 
country, the economic crisis, and the electoral processes. 
  Just as we accepted our electoral defeat and turned over the 
reins of government to the victorious political forces of the 
National Opposition Union (UNO), the FSLN must do its part and 
contribute to the democratization of the country and its 
institutions. 
  Above all, it must discuss and debate the great issues that 
we face today. The most important one is the country's economic 
plight. This issue is being discussed with a lot of limitations, 
without giving it the priority it deserves. 
  Elections are now replacing the armed struggle of the past. 
  Many countries all over the world are attributing to the 
electoral struggle the importance it deserves in the effort to 
continue changes that could not be brought about through armed 
struggle. 
  In Nicaragua, we must look at the electoral process in a 
revolutionary way; if we disdain it as an ideologized measure or 
procedure, we will not make any changes. 
  We must create a democracy in the country, expand it, 
participate in elections, make the institutions of government 
and civil society work. 
  Nicaragua is not an island; external influence plays an 
important role politically, economically, and socially. What is 
the worldwide trend that is taking place? 
  We have to look at it this way so that we can resolve the 
problems that have arisen, so that we can take office in the 
future and govern by national consensus. 
  No doubt about it, the market and competitiveness are the 
watchwords of the day. We must depart from that point to 
participate as a nation in this worldwide trend and improve the 
populace's socioeconomic conditions. 
  [Irias] What are the obstacles to the FSLN's assuming office 
again? 
  [Tirado] We face one obstacle: the economic crisis. You are 
not going to defend the workers' interests with alms. I think 
that defending the workers means creating jobs, training them, 
and giving them access to the resources generated by the 
production system. 
  If you want to govern, you have to solve that problem, not 
with populist measures, but with jobs, investment. 
  [Irias] What can the FSLN do right now to begin solving this 
problem? 
  [Tirado] We must begin by revising the government's 
macroeconomic policies; that is the responsibility of all 
political forces and economic sectors in the country. 
  We must seek a consensus to free up the economic mechanisms 
and revitalize production. 
  I think that it is in the legal, civic opposition that we 
have gained the least experience. It has not been a constructive 
opposition, which we said we would build when we lost the 
elections. 
  The FSLN's job is not to help solve short-term problems of 
poverty, but to contribute to a genuine change in the course of 
economic policy to open up new sources of employment. 
  The FSLN must take a serious approach to economic issues to 
set the country's economic course. 
  If the FSLN undertakes this task seriously, in the next 
elections we may not win in a landslide, but we will increase 
our percentage of the vote. 
  [Irias] What internal effort is necessary in the FSLN to 
regain its leadership? 
  [Tirado] We must establish leadership in the economic 
sphere. 
No leadership is capable of implementing all the economic 
measures that the trade associations are demanding of the 
government. 
  Next week the trade associations--coffee growers, 
stockmen--plan to stage a demonstration, calling for the 
discussion of macroeconomic policies. That is an effort at 
establishing leadership. No political party has taken the lead 
in this discussion. 
  No economic leadership--which is also political 
leadership--has emerged from within the FSLN. It is not a matter 
of wresting the leadership from the trade associations; it is a 
matter of using the legal and institutional means at the FSLN's 
disposal and sitting down to discuss the economic policies that 
are being called into question. 
  The Sandinist Front should provide an alternative for all of 
these demands. That is the kind of economic leadership that I 
think is most important. 
  [Irias] Do you agree with the existence of factions in the 
FSLN? 
  [Tirado] There has been a lot of talk here about the 
democratization of the FSLN. It is not just a matter of holding 
a congress to reelect our officials. 
  The factions represent a more comprehensive democratization 
in the FSLN. Some people get upset because these factions could 
lead to divisiveness. That is true, but the divisiveness is 
there whether or not there are factions. 
  Those who are in charge of these currents of opinion should 
bear in mind that political discussion should serve to 
strengthen rather than to widen distances. 
  Some people have legitimate aspirations, but that should not 
cause them to split away from Sandinism, because that would be 
counterproductive. 
  The factions will play an important role in the 
democratization of the FSLN, independently of the congress or of 
any other activity that might make the FSLN more credible and 
help it win the people's trust. 
  [Irias] It is said that the National Directorate agreed that 
its members would not be involved in any factions. Is that 
correct information? 
  [Tirado] There was no decision; it was left up to each 
individual. Each one was to gauge the consequences and decide 
for himself. I do not recall any clear-cut decision being made. 
The matter was discussed in a very limited fashion. 
  If this whole process is part of democracy, no member of the 
National Directorate will remain aloof from these factions. 
Otherwise, we will isolate ourselves. If this is aimed at 
democratizing the FSLN, what will Victor Tirado or Bayardo Arce 
do? Remain on the sidelines watching the action? 
  What will we do? I suppose we will take sides with one 
faction or another. Actually, right now individuals already 
participate as groups, classes, or social sectors. 
  The members of the National Directorate will have to decide 
to go with one of the two camps; otherwise, some will be left 
out. 
  [Irias] There has been speculation that you would sign one 
of 
the documents made public by the factions. Will you sign at some 
point? 
  [Tirado] My participation in particular--in a faction--will 
depend on whether they take up and discuss these economic issues 
and institutions. We must know where we want to take our country. 
  The issue that interests me is economics. I am not satisfied 
with political matters. This country's backwardness is an 
economic problem. 
  I think that the factions should discuss economic matters, 
add economic issues to their agenda. They should also add the 
issue of the Army. 
  [Irias] Will the FSLN regain its peasant face? 
  [Tirado] It lost the support of the peasantry over the 
economic issue. They turned their backs on us because of the 
price controls, expropriations, and distribution mechanisms. We 
did not use the market to help peasants develop. These measures 
caused the peasants to distance themselves from the FSLN. 
  The FSLN should participate in the responses to economic 
problems and attract undecided voters. The Sandinist Front must 
present an alternative beyond what is being discussed now. 
  In the discussion of the economic policies that are being 
applied, we can win back the peasant face of the FSLN. It is 
already happening. 
  [Irias] What are your personal aspirations? 
  [Tirado] I was thinking of beginning to write my 
autobiography while at the same time staying with the Sandinist 
Front. Thirty years in the FSLN, that has been my life. 
  I have to find a way of surviving, of earning a living. You 
always have to participate in political and social activities, 
in revolutionary activities. It is impossible to live in 
isolation. 
  I think that sometimes we Sandinists of this generation, who 
fought against Somoza and spent 10 years fighting against the 
United States, have turned positive things into obstacles to the 
organization and to society. We must make way for others, young 
people, the new generation that lived on the threshold of war 
and peace. 
  One generation has to replace the other so that we can 
resolve our conflict. I am in favor of having new young people 
with a different mentality come in. We cannot remain wedded to 
what we did in the past. 
  There is always a new alternative that we as a generation 
have not managed to reinvent. 
  [Irias] Do you think the current situation in the FSLN is 
being influenced by the differences between Daniel Ortega and 
Sergio Ramirez? 
  [Tirado] I do not think so. I think the media are largely to 
blame. When they personalize our leaders, the media take sides. 
They should be more objective. 
  I do not think it is a personal problem. I think everyone 
wants reform in the FSLN. 
  Individuals can also have aspirations; individual initiative 
is not a crime. I believe that these ideas should be channeled 
through the established mechanisms, that the bylaws should be 
allowed to function. 
  If the current mechanisms are not working, new mechanisms 
should be developed.

    [Editorial Report] Managua BARRTCADA in Spanish of 20 April 
1994 on pages 1 and 5 reports that Sandinist Youth (JS) members 
charge that the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN) is 
"divorced" from its youth members. In addition to the accusation 
that the FSLN "is turning into a party for the old," JS members 
say the party suffers from a lack of unity and democracy and 
"has lost credibility...due to the behavior of its leaders." 
Former JS leader Roberto Stuart points out that the party is no 
longer influential with young people because FSLN leaders "do 
not listen" to the ideas of others. Javier Cardoze, JS secretary 
in Rivas, warns that the FSLN will be hard pressed "to attract 
the youth vote in 1996." Youth leaders call for wider 
participation by JS members in decisionmaking activities and a 
higher standard of ethics.

<F P=106> ["Message" from Ernesto Perez Balladares, Panamanian </F>
presidential candidate of the United People alliance, in Panama 
City -- recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow citizens: I ended my political campaign by 
extending my family's pardon, as well as my own, to citizen Juan 
Bautista Zapata, because I believe reconciliation should be 
preached with examples, and because I do not want an incident 
that all Panamanians deplore to weigh heavily on my mind, or on 
the minds of those who will support me on 8 May. 
  Reconciliation is the main pillar on which our government 
program is based. It is impossible to link all of the social 
groups to the great enterprise of national reconstruction if we 
do not end, once and for all, the hatred and zeal for 
persecution that have poisoned our society. 
  The task of strengthening institutions so that no one feels 
excluded, while maintaining the rules of democracy, demands 
total dedication, and there is no time for fruitless reprisals 
or revenge. Likewise, there is no place for governments in which 
a single party monopolizes public functions. 
  Furthermore, I dare say better service is rendered to 
democracy if citizens who are not involved in political 
confrontations share the administrative responsibilities, 
particularly in posts dealing with the supreme task of managing 
justice. This is why I promised throughout the political 
campaign, which officially ends today, that before election day 
I would announce the name of the attorney general of the nation 
whom I intend to appoint from the lists I was given by the 
National Bar Association and the law school faculties of the 
National University of Panama and the Santa Maria La Antigua 
University. 
  A democratic regime must guarantee citizens the honest 
management of justice and an Attorney General's Office that 
separate itself from the passions and vicissitudes of politics. 
Therefore, it is preferable -- although the Constitution does 
not order this -- for the nation's attorney general not to 
belong to the president's party or that he share his political 
ideology. This guarantees that the post will never be used for 
political persecution or to harbor the crimes perpetrated by 
high-ranking public officials. As a citizen, I would not like 
to see investigations end at points at which they should start. 
Moreover, it would not be fitting that the state's immense 
power be used to initiate phony legal proceedings against the 
current rulers' political opponents. 
  Mercedes Arauz de Grimaldo, Wilfredo Saenz, and Jose Antonio 
Sossa offer these guarantees. They personify all of the virtues 
that should grace an attorney general of the nation -- 
education, experience, honesty, and, above all else, the desire 
to serve justice without seeking to figure prominently or to 
launch a persecution. Therefore, it is from these prestigious 
lawyers -- who will have to retire from active party membership 
-- that I will choose the nation's new attorney general and his 
two substitutes. 
  I am hereby fulfilling a campaign promise, and, with the 
same 
conviction, I reassert another equally important one -- to 
respect other people's opinions. Those who seek to rule the 
nation's destiny must be prepared to accept, with republican 
humility, criticism from any citizen -- no matter how severe 
such criticism might be -- and, moreover, accept those 
criticisms issued by the media. The media represent, in most 
cases, the eyes and ears of society. To disregard their appeals 
would show poor judgment, and attempts to silence the media run 
counter to the minimal standards of democratic coexistence. 
  With this pledge and this conviction, I want to start, along 
with all of you, a new era of hope and reconciliation. Thank 
you.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ruben Dario Carles, Panamanian presidential </F>
candidate of Change '94, marking the conclusion of his campaign 
for the 8 May presidential elections, at the El Panama Hotel in 
Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] [Shouting: "Chinchorro, Chinchorro"] Fellow 
citizens. I have dedicated my life to my fatherland. I have 
worked very hard in very important positions in the government 
and private sector to achieve the maximum development of Panama, 
with the purpose of improving as much as possible the living 
standards of all Panamanians. 
  The current campaign has been very difficult. On the one 
hand, I had to act as a retaining wall against the aspirations 
of those who served militarism, and, on the other hand, against 
those who know that we will not permit corruption in our 
government. The struggle has been hard and many times I have 
been misunderstood. I know my image on television has not been 
the best. I have been what advertisers call a hard-to-sell 
product. [laughter, applause] Nevertheless, after touring the 
entire country, and with the experience of many years of 
dedication, I know that with your resolve and faith we can build 
a better Panama. 
  Today I want to speak to Panamanian youths. I dedicated over 
30 years of my life to university teaching. I know -- I was 
also young -- that in the classrooms I saw the illusions 
reflected in my students' faces, their thirst for knowledge, 
their hope in the future, their desire to excel, and their 
desire to work. Today I want to say that, as president, I will 
work fervently for their hopes, for their future. [applause] 
  Panama must strive to have its children and youths not only 
educated but that the education imparted be top quality. 
Education must contribute to the overall development of 
individuals. A country's most important resource is its own 
people. As a teacher, and as an offspring of teachers, I also 
want to address the teachers. Education must be placed in the 
very best hands. Legal instruments must be adopted to guarantee 
the education sector the income, the job stability, and training 
of all those who have the dedication and aptitude to teach. 
Education is not a job, nor is it a profession. It simply is 
an apostolate. [applause] Just as one cannot learn with hunger, 
one cannot teach well if one is hungry. 
  Now I want to address the Panamanian women -- that woman who 
is mother and father at home and the family's only means of 
support. I want to speak to the housewife, to the professional 
woman. I, Ruben Carles, profess infinite faith in the 
Panamanian woman. My love for my mother and my wife, and the 
distinction I have afforded women in the companies that I have 
administered and in the public posts I have held are my best 
credentials. Our government will see to it that women occupy 
the posts they deserve in our society. [applause] 
  Today I also want to address the men in the countryside, 
many 
of who are here -- the farmers and cattlemen. The agricultural 
and livestock production in the country must not only be 
protected, it must be augmented and stimulated. As president, I 
tell the agriculture-livestock producer and 
agriculture-industrial producers that they will find in our 
government the most determined cooperation and protection, both 
for the domestic market as well as to promote and increase 
exports. [applause] 
  I also want to speak to the doctors, dentists, and all of 
those professionals in the field of health. We need a healthy 
population. A sick population is a living accusation against the 
state and government. A country, in order to prosper, needs to 
have a healthy population, both physically and spiritually. 
That goal will be a priority concern in our government. 
[applause] 
  Additionally, I have excellent running mates, individually 
and collectively better than those on any other slate. We have, 
and they are here, a team that understands all the peculiarities 
of the Panamanian situation, a team made up of workers, 
peasants, teachers, lawyers, engineers, architects, bankers, 
executives, businessmen, and clerks. I don't hide anybody in 
the closet. [applause] 
  I ask all the Panamanian people to have faith in the future. 
The government that will result from the victory of 'Change 94 
will be made up of men and women of this country, with the 
knowledge, capacity, honesty, experience, character, and vigor 
required from them by the current Panamanian situation. 
[applause] This team, which basically consists of yourselves, 
will be enriched by youngsters who are willing to participate 
and make contributions to the building of the country. 
[applause] The new government must immediately work to meet the 
most urgent needs of the population. It must promote the 
generation of new jobs, which will reduce the unemployment 
affecting so many families. To do this, we have concrete and 
realistic projects, with viable financing. Our programs do not 
include fantasies, poetry, novels, or songs. [applause] 
  Our government must create conditions to improve real 
income, 
permitting Panamanians to achieve a better standard of living. 
To that end, we must create the atmosphere of confidence that 
invites and attracts private investments, be it domestic or 
foreign. Panama needs in the near future a government that is 
capable and honest, not one just honest in words but honest as 
certified by a clean public and private life. [applause] It 
must be a government determined to make decisions, with the 
wisdom to ensure those decisions are wise, with the experience 
to ensure they are practical, with the moral integrity to ensure 
they are honest, with the character to ensure they are 
implemented, with the vigor to implement them without delay, and 
with discipline to ensure they are executed well. [applause] 
  And we are going to win. [applause] My conviction is 
supported by the fact the Panamanian people in these elections 
will not only elect the government that will govern their 
destiny over the next five years, but they will decide their 
future for the 21st century. We must enter the world of 
development, otherwise, it will take us many decades to achieve 
it and it will be the poverty-stricken people who will suffer 
the consequences of that failure. 
  Panama can achieve that development because our country has 
diverse natural resources and institutional opportunities. We 
only need to develop and take advantage of them to turn them 
into facts that the country's entire population can fully enjoy. 
We must also provide public services efficiently. The 
existence of adequate electricity, telephone, water, garbage 
collection, and security services are indispensable for new 
investments. 
  Deficient and costly public services hamper the overall 
development and well-being of Panamanians. We must effectively 
defeat crime and eradicate violence in our streets. We must 
protect the life and well-being of individuals and their 
properties. We must have zero tolerance for drug trafficking, 
distribution, and consumption. We must eliminate the impunity 
that prevails regarding these offenses. We must prevent and 
persecute money laundering. 
  The country demands security at all levels, everywhere, and 
in all activities. All of this will be accomplished if we have 
as our objective the benefit and well-being of the people of 
Panama. Also necessary are other transportation and port 
facilities that must be efficient and competitive. After the 
country elects our government on 8 May, we will immediately take 
measures to receive the Panama Canal efficiently. We will, 
however, steer the inter-oceanic region toward the creation of 
an international maritime center, and this must be accomplished 
prior to 31 December 1999. Thus, the country will truly receive 
the economic benefits from its extraordinary geographic 
position. The Panamanian state was created to serve its 
population and not to serve itself. The authorities should only 
be an instrument through which the state fulfills its lofty 
goals and duties. Our government will fulfill this mission. 
This is why victory will be ours if the Panamanian people have 
faith in God and the future. [applause] 
  Our government, which will also be the government of all of 
you, will be, as Lincoln defined it, a government of the 
people, by the people, and for the people. Thank you very much. 
[applause]

    [Editorial Report] Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish, on the 
back page of the front section of its 4 May edition, publishes 
an unattributed, four-color, full-page, paid advertisement that 
questions the background of members of the Papa Egoro Movement, 
including its presidential candidate Ruben Blades. The same 
four-color, full-page advertisement is published by Panama City 
LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish on page 18A of its 3 May 
edition and by Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish on page 
15A of its 4 May edition. 
  The upper left-hand corner of this advertisement features a 
four-color graphic of the flag of the Communist Party of Italy. 
Next to this flag, flushed right in the upper right-hand corner 
of the page, is a graphic of the Papa Egoro logo. Although the 
Communist Party flag features the words "Democratic Party of the 
Left" and a small graphic rendition of a red flag with a hammer 
and sickle -- none of which is found in the Papa Egoro logo -- 
the two graphics are similar in that both feature green trees 
against white, circular backgrounds inside large orange fields. 
Beneath the Italian Communist Party flag, the words "Communist 
Party, Italy" are published in boldface. Beneath the Papa Egoro 
logo, the words "Ideological Recognition" are published in 
boldface. 
  Immediately below the flag and logo, there is a box 
featuring 
three quotes attributed to Ruben Blades. The box reads as 
follows: 
  ```I have been charged with belonging to the left because I 
do not belong to the right.' 
  ```Che Guevara's project remains in effect.' 
  ```Another thing that remains in effect is the need for a 
change, because there should be a change, no matter where it 
comes from.' 
  ``Ruben Blades, (NOTIMEX) Chile'' 
  Under the box, there is a section headlined: "What Does Papa 
Egoro Propose?" This section of the advertisement reads: 
  "*`The first thing the new government must do is have its 
own 
currency' -- Raul Leis, ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin 
America] conference, University of Panama 
  ``* `Mandatory military service is required' -- Ruben 
Blades, 
TVN Dialogue 
  ``* 'Raise the Social Security quotas' -- Ruben Blades, 
ILDEA 
[Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies] 
  ``* `We will change the Assembly in order to rule' -- 
Fernando Manfredo, Youth '94 TVN'' 
  Under this middle section, there is a final section 
headlined 
"Who Is Papa Egoro?" This section of the advertisement reads as 
follows (all capitalization as published): 
  "PRESIDENT: RUBEN BLADES 
  ``FIRST VICE PRESIDENT: CARL NORDSTROM, former PRD 
[Democratic Revolutionary Party] member, architect of Noriega's 
mansions. 
  ``SECRETARY GENERAL AND SPOKESMAN: RAUL LEIS, member of the 
TENDENCY; activist in solidarity organizations with the 
Sandinist National Liberation Front and the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front in Nicaragua and El Salvador, 
respectively. 
  ``ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PARTY: CARLOS VALLE, 
Noriegista activist in San Miguelito. Charged with embezzlement 
of the state's sports organizations. Fired from IRHE [Institute 
of Hydraulic Resources and Electrification] in 1990 for 
participating in Eduardo Herrera's coup d'etat plans. 
  "NATIONAL DIRECTORATE ADVISER: DR. ROBERTO CEDENO, author of 
Ruben Blades' Marxist biography, Noriega's former doctor. 
Member of the Communist Party's Political Bureau. 
  "PAPA EGORO CAMPAIGN MANAGER: MIMI DE NORDSTROM, Noriega's 
secretary in G-2 [military intelligence], trusted translator at 
the Panama Defense Forces [FDP] headquarters under Noriega's 
regime. 
  ``PRESS CAMPAIGN MANAGER: REY BARRIA, ECLA employee. Served 
as leader of the PRD's TENDENCY coordinated by [former 
Legislator Luis] Lucho Gomez. Appointed by Noriega at Channel 5. 
  ``COURT OF HONOR AND DISCIPLINE: GUILLERMO FRANCO, former 
PRD 
member, G-2 informer. 
  ``COLLABORATORS: GUILLERMO TATO LEDESMA, former PRD member, 
commander in chief of the Dignity Battalions' An Eye for an Eye 
and a Tooth for a Tooth Operation in San Miguelito, Punta 
Paitilla. 
  ``GRACIELA DIXON AND EGBERT WEATHERBORN: Members of 
GUAYKUCHO [Left-wing student group named after the Guaymi, Kuna, 
and Choco Indians]. Accused by [former Colonel Roberto] Diaz 
Herrera of receiving -- along with RAMIRO GUERRA (lawyer of the

<F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Ricardo Ledezma, a member of Ruben Blades' campaign 
committee, has stressed that the leadership of the Papa Egoro 
Movement [MPE] is not under communist influence, nor does it 
maintain any type of relationship with Fidel Castro's Cuban 
Government. 
  Leo Gonzalez, a legislator for Molirena [Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement] stated that Fidel Castro's regime is 
allegedly coordinating and providing logistical support for 
members of the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] and PRD 
dissidents who joined the MPE. Gonzalez says he has sent 
documents attesting to this to Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino 
for verification and for an investigation. Thus far, the 
Foreign Ministry has said nothing. 
  Meanwhile, Ricardo Ledezma said the accusations are 
unfounded. 
  [Begin recording] [Ledezma] An accusation is filed when 
there is proof to confirm the accusation. We believe these 
accusations are irresponsible, particularly in the final stages 
of the electoral period. We are in the final week of an 
electoral period that has been rather calm. It is dangerous to 
make accusations like these without clear evidence. 
  [Unidentified reporter] MPE has not had contact with Cuba or 
any Cubans during this election? 
  [Ledezma, laughing] No, there has been no contact. I have a 
couple of Cuban friends who have resided in Panama for many 
years. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Ledezma, there have been reports suggesting 
that the Italian Communist Party's flag is very similar to the 
MPE's. 
  [Ledezma] That is another example of manipulation. It is 
obvious this is a campaign orchestrated by the traditional 
political parties to prevent the triumph of decency in these 
elections. That is obvious. These matters are highly 
manipulated. Take for example the flag issue; the fact there 
are trees in the Communist Party's flag and our flag is 
insignificant. It is as if I took the flag of any other 
political party and associated it with 1,000 symbols that exist 
in this world only because they have the same colors or similar 
elements. In other words, this is so childish that the people 
can clearly see it is a smear campaign. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994. 
  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential candidate for the 
Arnulfist Party (PA), said on 26 April that the constitutional 
articles on the creation and functions of the defunct Panama 
Defense Forces must be amended. De Gruber visited Betania 
Corregimiento on the morning of 26 April and stated: "When the 
president tried to reform the Constitution, various legislators 
erroneously tried to modify several articles. That is why the 
Panamanian people rejected the constitutional reforms." (Panama 
City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 26 Apr 94) 
  Ruben Blades, presidential candidate of the Papa Egoro 
Movement, MPE, said that the polls indicate he is tied for first 
place with Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, candidate 
Ernesto Perez Balladares. Regarding support for him in the 
interior, Blades stated: "I think we have more support in the 
interior than is reflected in the polls." MPE slate members 
said as part of their government program that no public 
employees will be dismissed. (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 Apr 94) 
  Government Minister Jacobo Salas said that the president 
guaranteed that the 8 May elections will be free. Salas 
explained that "violence will not be tolerated, regardless of 
where it comes from." Regarding the decree banning weapons 
sales, Salas said it will remain in effect until 31 March. The 
minister stressed that "it is the president's desire to hold 
free elections in which violence -- we are confident there will 
not be any violence -- must be repressed, regardless of where it 
originates." (Panama City EL SIGLO in Spanish 28 Apr 94 p 10) 
  Transportation sectors have endorsed the Democratic Alliance 
slate led by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. Some 52 taxi drivers' 
organizations in Panama Province met in a Panama City hotel to 
endorse the candidacy of PA presidential candidate Mireya 
Moscoso de Gruber. The transportation workers delivered Mrs. De 
Gruber a list of proposals to modify Law 14 regulating 
transportation. De Gruber promised to meet the transportation 
workers' requests and said: "When we are at the presidency, you 
will have a friend more than a president. You will advise me on 
how my government can work better for all of you." (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 29 Apr 94) 
  On the evening of 3 May, PRD presidential candidate Ernesto 
Perez Balladares met with farmers from Chiriqui Province in 
Boquete. Perez Balladares addressed farmers on the need to 
improve roads in production areas, erroneous government 
agricultural policy, and falling coffee prices. He told 
producers he will establish "adequate protection for the 
agricultural sector for crops such as potatoes, rice, beans, 
corn, and sorghum." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA 5 May 94 
p B7)

<F P=106> [Article by Orlando Mendiate] </F>
  [Text] Legislator Leo Gonzalez, vice president of the 
Legislative Assembly's Drug Affairs Committee, charged yesterday 
that Fidel Castro's regime is "meddling" in the Panamanian 
electoral process to favor and support the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD). 
  Gonzalez, who delivered some very compromising documents to 
Foreign Minister Jose Mulino, said that he received these 
documents on Sunday from a reliable source who has never failed 
him with information on drugs and narcotics trafficking. 
Gonzalez preferred to withhold the name, as this is very 
delicate information. According to Gonzalez, who did not 
disclose the full contents of the documents, there is 
information on high-ranking PRD leaders traveling to Cuba to 
meet allegedly with political and government figures of that 
island. 
  These persons -- Gonzalez added -- include PRD Secretary 
General Michel Doens, who traveled to Cuba at least five times 
between 1992 and 1993. Also included on the list are Ramiro 
Vasquez Chambonet, Nils Castro, and Luis Gomez. 
  The documents include a letter dated 12 January 1994 on the 
letterhead of Roberto Infante, acting Cuban consul in Panama, 
addressed to Cuban Foreign Minister. In this letter, the Cuban 
consul tells the Cuban foreign minister that he held meetings 
with "the boys from the eleven" [a reference to the PRD's flag], 
allegedly from the PRD. Infante told Robaina that in Panama 
"everything is progressing according to the strategy of the 
People to Power" [a reference to the PRD's campaign slogan], 
adding that everything is being done according to his 
instructions, and -- best yet -- to his wishes. 
  "The atmosphere is favorable to our friends, and the polls 
show it. Once again, we reiterated our solidarity and 
unconditional support," says Infante's note to Robaina. Infante 
added that an "expert from the eleven" will visit him and 
explain further on the advice and technical assistance they will 
need for the next game, that is, the 8 May elections. 
  "With regard to comments, I believe everything can be 
summarized in only one remark: The bull [reference to PRD 
candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares] is in charge of this farm," 
Infante says, adding that the necessary peons have been provided 
so that there will not be any interruptions in the scheduled 
activities. 
  Gonzalez, who is seeking reelection on the Morena Party 
[National Renewal Movement] ticket, said that he has the 
documents that prove his charges, and he is waiting for Foreign 
Minister Mulino to verify the authenticity of the documents. 
Gonzalez added that members from the PRD Tendency faction and 
Papa Egoro Movement are taking trips to Cuba to coordinate 
logistics support for these parties from Cuba. "This is a 
communist country meddling in the Panamanian elections," he 
emphasized. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Mulino said that given the 
importance of the issue and the seriousness of the alleged 
charges, he has initiated a "very careful" investigation of the 
case. Mulino said that he will not make any comments until he 
has analyzed and read the documents Leo Gonzalez gave him. "I 
do not know what decision I will make," the foreign minister 
concluded.

  [Text] Panama City, 4 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Miguel Martinez, 
charge d'affaires of the Cuban Embassy, stated today that the 
document on which a legislator based his accusation that Fidel 
Castro's government is meddling in Panama's domestic affairs is 
counterfeit. 
  The Cuban diplomat, who is his government's top 
representative in Panama, stated at a news conference that the 
document on which legislator Leo Gonzalez based his charges is 
"counterfeit, spurious, and prefabricated." 
  Martinez noted that the bogus document, which reached the 
Cuban Embassy through "a friendly Panamanian," was delivered by 
him on 25 April to Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos 
Cordero. He warned Cordero about the possibility that it might 
be used as part of "a disinformation campaign." 
  The document links ranking members of the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) and members of the Papa Egoro Movement 
with operations to exchange drugs for weapons in Cuba, 
legislator Gonzalez revealed. 
  Spokesmen for both parties noted that Gonzalez's charges are 
the result of his low vote expectations in the upcoming 
election, in which he is up for reelection and, according to 
political polls, could very well lose. 
  The Cuban charge d'affaires noted today that the document 
features forged signatures of Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina; Panamanian Consul Robert Infante; and Hector Hernandez 
Pardo, director of the Superior Institute of Foreign Relations 
of Cuba. 
  To enable reporters to confirm the forged signatures, he 
showed them official Foreign Ministry documents with the 
signatures of the officials, which were different from those 
contained in the controversial document. 
  "They do not match. They have been altered and forged," 
Martinez said, insisting that the Cuban Embassy "wants to 
resolve this matter." 
  "We have been and will continue to be objective, and we do 
not meddle in Panama's domestic affairs," the diplomat stated, 
describing as "irresponsible" the manipulation of such an 
"extremely delicate" issue that could affect relations between 
two states. 
  Miguel Martinez explained that the "counterfeit documents" 
were available months ago in the Panamanian capital, and he 
added that people whose identity he did not know were asking up 
to $20,000 to sell them. 
  Since the U.S. Army invasion on 20 December 1989, relations 
between Cuba and Panama have been maintained at a nominal level 
without any diplomatic representative at embassy level.

  [Text] PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] Secretary 
General Mitchel Doens has denied reports that his party is 
receiving support from the Cuban Government, as claimed by 
Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] legislator 
Leo Gonzalez. Doens said PRD members had previous knowledge 
about the document Gonzalez presented, which Doens described as 
a political gambit, and he announced that he will file slander 
complaints against the Molirena legislator in the Peace and 
Justice Commission and in the Electoral Tribunal. 
  [Begin Doens recording] The only thing I can say is that Mr. 
Gonzalez is a mouse who got caught in his own trap. A few weeks 
ago, we had this document in our possession because a friend in 
the government gave it to us. We immediately wrote a letter to 
the Justice and Peace Commission and delivered it to commission 
member Ms. Irene Perurena with the document Mr. Gonzalez 
yesterday brought to the Foreign Ministry. 
  Earlier, we talked with a top Cuban Embassy official to have 
him explain that document to us. We found the document to be 
completely false, considering it contains seven mistakes, 
including forged signatures of the officials who are allegedly 
in charge of directions at the Cuban Embassy and in Cuba. 
  Later, Cuban Charge d'Affaires Miguel Martinez delivered 
this 
document to the Foreign Ministry, before Mr. Gonzalez did, 
precisely because of the implications this could have on his 
diplomatic mission in the country. We can categorically say 
this is a political gambit that is part of the dirty propaganda 
tactics being used against our party. [end recording]

  [Text] Panama City, 4 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The Panamanian 
police confiscated from the "Cali Cartel" 900 kg of cocaine 
worth $36 million. The cocaine was going to be sent by land to 
Guatemala for shipment to the United States. 
  Idelfonso Suira, head of criminal investigations of the 
Judicial Technical Police (PTJ), confirmed today in a news 
conference the arrest of six Panamanians, four Colombians, and 
one Peruvian linked to the drug shipment, one of the country's 
largest. Authorities did not release the names of the persons 
arrested and who were placed in the custody of the Attorney 
General's Office. The authorities did say that the drugs 
belonged to the international gang known as the "Cali Cartel," 
because it is based in that Colombian city. 
  Suira said that the drugs, wrapped in red, yellow, and green 
1-kg packages, were seized in an auto repair shop in Panama 
City. The repair shop was preparing a false bottom in a vehicle 
to be used to take the cocaine to Guatemala. 
  The General Customs Directorate (DGA) reported that during 
the four years of President Guillermo Endara's mandate, the DGA 
alone seized more than 4.5 tons of drugs worth $230.7 million 
and 312 persons of various nationalities were arrested, 98 of 
them women. Some of the largest cocaine shipments, amounting to 
several hundred kg, have been seized in the Colon Free Zone, one 
of Latin America's largest free zones. Panama's security 
organizations publicly pledged not to allow the Colombian mafia 
or guerrillas to plant coca leaves in Panamanian territory, 
which, together with drug trafficking to U.S. markets, has 
become another threat to the country. 
  Last month brought to a close a long joint operation in 
Panama with the assistance of Colombia and the United States, in 
which several plantations in the Darien jungle in southern 
Panama were destroyed. The United States has warned of drug 
traffickers' interest in Panama due to its free zone, 
international banking center, and permissive corporate laws. 
Nevertheless, U.S. Government drug "Czar" Lee Brown, 
responsible for fighting drugs, said that the current Panamanian 
civilian government in 18 months has seized more drugs than 
during the 20 years of military dictatorship. In 1993, nearly 4 
tons of drugs were seized in Panama, mostly cocaine from 
Colombia, while in the two preceding years a total of only 3 
tons were seized. 
  Major Jose Rosas, director of the National Maritime Service 
(SMN), told ACAN-EFE that drug trafficking activity in Panama 
has dropped since 1993, at least with regards to maritime 
surveillance. In 1992, he said, packets of cocaine that were 
dropped into the sea from night flights fell like rain on 
Panamanian coasts. The increase in drug trafficking led the 
government to authorize the construction of several naval bases 
to resupply SMN patrol boats, both in the Gulf of Panama as well 
as in the western area bordering Costa Rica.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 May (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
today expressed optimism that the Argentine Congress will 
approve the law on pharmaceutical patents and thus avoid U.S. 
economic sanctions, but he made it clear that "we will not take 
a drastic position" over any congressional delay in approving it. 
  Menem noted: "One could either follow the European or the 
Brazilian models," adding: "One must not forget that the United 
States is not acting in the world alone, it is part of an 
interdependent world." 
  He noted that Washington is engaged in "the NAFTA process, 
which seeks to promote free trade, while we are within Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South]." He said there are many options 
available as far as approving this law is concerned. 
  Menem said: "We are committed to lobbying for the proposal, 
but we are not going to force lawmakers." 
  In remarks during the program "Controversy at the Bar," 
Menem 
joked with the actors and told producer Gerardo Sofovich that if 
he expected the president to defend him against the 
"aggressions" of his colleagues, he will have to pay him his 
"fees as an attorney." 
  Menem also described as "simple rumors" reports of federal 
government intervention in the Buenos Aires City Council and in 
the Tucuman Province Legislature. He also denied charges that 
he only grants interviews to "journalists who are my friends."

  [Text] Argentina and the Republic of Slovenia signed on 4 
May a bilateral agreement on cultural cooperation that will be 
retroactive to the date diplomatic relations were established, 
in April 1992. The agreement, which establishes the 
implementation mechanisms for cooperation and exchange in the 
spheres of culture, science, and education, was signed during 
the course of a ceremony that was held in San Martin Palace with 
the participation of Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella and Slovene 
Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle. This was Peterle's first 
activity after having arrived in the country. Today he is 
scheduled to meet with President Carlos Menem, and he will 
afterwards visit Congress, where he will meet with Justicialist 
Party Senator Luis Rubeo.

  [Excerpts] In a surprising interpretation of the case 
involving the finding of an arsenal in Buenos Aires Province's 
delta region, President Carlos Menem yesterday admitted that his 
life could have been in danger because he sometimes spends 
weekends on an island owned by Mario Falak, a friend of his, not 
far from where the arsenal was found. [passage omitted] 
  The government has minimized the possibility of an 
ultra-rightist terrorist organization from the very beginning. 
  The police have only charged Alejandro Suchsdorf, owner of 
the premises where the arsenal was found. Also involved in the 
case was Marcelo Schetino, driver and guard of Military 
Household Chief General Jorge Rearte. 
  Rearte is in charge of Menem's security. He said Schetino's 
record is unblemished. The justice department could not indict 
Schetino in this case and released him. Schetino, however, was 
arrested again when Susana Louzao accused him of having 
kidnapped her four years ago. 
  Menem said Schetino "confessed -- or at least suggested -- 
that the resources were part of the painted faced [carapintada] 
cause." He added: "The police are investigating" whether this 
individual is connected in any way with "those responsible for 
blowing up the Israeli Embassy." 
  "When the arsenal was discovered and I said that perhaps the 
carapintada rebels were involved, the people almost lynched me. 
We must thoroughly investigate because the arsenal was 
discovered on a stream that leads to a house of Mario Falak, a 
friend of mine," Menem said. [passage omitted] 
  The president told Radio America reporters that you can 
travel to the delta zone "by helicopter or boat," adding that 
"he (Sucksdorf) had missiles that could blow up a helicopter or 
a boat -- or even the president." [passage omitted].

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 May (NA) -- Reliable official 
sources have indicated that, during a meeting with Economy 
Minister Domingo Cavallo and Presidential Secretary General 
Eduardo Bauza, Tucuman Governor Ramon "Palito" Ortega allegedly 
tendered his resignation due to serious disagreements between 
him and the ruling-party's bloc in the provincial congress. 
  Government officials calmed the provincial governor, 
confirming their support for his government actions and 
promising that they would seek a solution to the crisis as last 
night similar reports noted that top-level government circles 
were drawing up a decree on the intervention of the Tucuman 
congress. 
  Official sources unofficially reported that Justicialist 
Party [PJ] provincial legislators have been urgently summoned to 
the federal capital to meet government officials within the next 
few hours at Government House to seek a "political solution" 
before implementing a federal solution. 
  Ortega yesterday received the support of President Carlos 
Menem and that of his high-ranking government officials over the 
"worrisome" opposition to his actions by the Tucuman PJ deputies. 
  Menem said: "We shall see what can be done, but the people 
have elected them to legislate and not to block the actions of 
those who are governing, as is happening in Tucuman." 
  Strongly supporting Ortega, Menem challenged: "It seems the 
vice governor Julio Diaz Lozano very strongly opposes the 
governor."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 5 May (NA) -- The PEN [National 
Executive Branch] has announced that the Constituent Convention 
will meet as of 0900 [1200 GMT] on 25 May. The executive branch 
asked the Entre Rios provincial government "to make all 
necessary arrangements for the meeting." 
  The call comes in Decree 657, which was published yesterday 
in the Official Gazette. The decree calls on "Constituent 
Assembly members elected on 10 April to meet in Parana, Entre 
Rios Province, at 0900 on 25 May 1994." 
  The decree is signed by President Carlos Menem and Interior 
Minister Carlos Ruckauf. It states that the call follows Law 
24309, which establishes that the Convention must open within 60 
days of the election. 
  The decree adds that the law declaring the need for 
reforming 
the Constitution "establishes that the Chamber of Deputies' 
internal regulation will regulate the Convention's operation" 
and that "due to the importance of the event, the opening date 
-- 25 May -- grants the occasion the necessary solemnity and 
importance because it coincides with another anniversary of our 
independence."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 5 May (NA) -- Cordoba Governor Eduardo 
Angeloz on 5 May denied that Senator Fernando de la Rua had 
rejected the proposal to join a UCR [Radical Civic Union] 
Political Action Commission, and stated that Raul Alfonsin's 
party "is, for the time being, not in a position to attain 
power." 
  Angeloz stated that "nobody has rejected the idea of sitting 
down around a table to discuss the UCR's future," although he 
acknowledged that "everyone is trying to talk it over with 
friends, and with the other members of their faction." 
  He added: "De la Rua asked for more information, more 
details. I told him all I could, and next week we will probably 
continue the conversation we started this week." [passage 
omitted] 
  Angeloz also denied having considered the possibility of 
becoming the UCR's presidential candidate for next year. He 
asked "what is the point of a ticket if the appropriate tool, 
that is, the party, has not been sharpened?" 
  He added that it is "much too early" to talk about an 
electoral alliance between the UCR and the Grand Front for the 
upcoming presidential elections. 
  "The Constituent Assembly is the first step that we must 
take 
to find out when the incumbent president will step down, when 
the elections will be held, and what it is that the people 
want," he said. 
  He concluded that he was "absolutely sure" that the people's 
interests were "different" from those of the politicians, and 
urged the leaders to "understand and grasp" what it is that the 
people want.

  [Text] Tandil, 4 May (NA) -- Air Force Chief of Staff 
Brigadier General Juan Paulik today said that it is 
"inadmissible to judge or doubt" the Armed Forces' "function of 
maintaining national sovereignty." 
  He said this today at the Tandil air base, during the 
commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the Argentine Air 
Force's baptism of fire. 
  President Carlos Menem attended the ceremony accompanied by 
Army Commander Lieutenant General Martin Balza and several 
government officials. 
  During the ceremony to commemorate the Air Force's baptism 
of 
fire in 1982, Paulik said: "Man and his instruction will forever 
be the marrow of military organization," despite the "evolution 
of scientific and technological progress." 
  "Technological progress will be of little use if the 
military 
career, the will to serve, the esprit de corps, loyalty, and the 
total conviction of our role as members of the armed branch of 
the nation is downgraded," Paulik said. 
  He added: "The current moment poses serious questions 
regarding the Armed Forces" but he considered that it 
"inadmissible to doubt or judge the function of maintaining 
national sovereignty." 
  The ceremony was also attended by former Air Force 
commanders 
Carlos Alberto Rey, Omar Graffigna, and Arturo Lami Dozo, 
Military Affairs Secretary Jorge Baeza, and union leader Diego 
Ibanez. 
  Brig. Gen. Paulik said the Air Force "has not given up the 
supreme mandate of acting as part of the military instrument at 
the service of the objectives of the National Government." 
  Finally, the Air Force chief paid homage to the pilots who 
fought in the South Atlantic war, describing them as "true 
examples of the duty of all Argentines, not just a few, to 
defend the motherland."

  [Excerpt] The heavy water plant located in Arroyito, 
Neuquen Province, the only one of its kind in the country, was 
shut down two days ago due to a fire that was quickly brought 
under control. There were no casualties. It is not yet known 
when the plant will be reactivated. 
  The fire, which occurred in a pipeline sector of the plant, 
has interrupted the long chemical process that will allow the 
plant to produce heavy water as of the beginning of 1996. Heavy 
water, which is used as a refrigerant for the turbines of 
nuclear plants, is currently being imported. 
  According to Fernando Huici, an engineer for the National 
Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA), the accident occurred due to 
"the failure of a support holding up part of a pipeline carrying 
a synthesis gas made up of hydrogen and nitrogen." 
  The official said "this gas, which has a temperature of 600 
degrees centigrade, ignites when it comes into contact with the 
atmosphere, and what we call the "blowtorch effect" occurred -- 
in other words, a small fire." 
  After stating that the plant's security has not been 
affected, Huici indicated that the plant's management has called 
in the Toese Company of Denmark, which installed the system, to 
carry out an inspection. 
  Although the official believed that "the plant will be 
running again" within the next few days, he lamented the 
interruption of the operation. "We were at a very important 
stage in the process," he said. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 5 May. 
  Central Bank President Roque Fernandez admitted today that 
local banks lost 5 percent of their capital because the prices 
of government securities on the international markets plummeted. 
Fernandez confirmed that Central Bank reserves total about $16 
billion. (Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2208 GMT 
21 Apr 94) 
  The Economy Ministry has reported that the government's 
primary surplus totaled 707.7 million pesos in the first quarter 
of the year. This sum is 217.3 million short of the targets 
established by the IMF for that quarter. (Buenos Aires NOTICIAS 
ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2128 GMT 29 Apr 94) 
  A Latin American Economic Research Foundation report notes 
that during the first quarter the industrial production rate 
grew 6.4 percent. (Buenos Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish 30 Apr 94 
Section 1 p 6) 
  Inflation for the year ended April 30 will be "slightly 
above 
4 percent," Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said yesterday. As 
to the retail price index in April, Cavallo's statement 
indicates that consumer prices last month went up around 0.3 
percent. (Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in English 4 May 94 
p 5) 
  In a communique, the state-owned Electricite de France (EDF) 
company announced that it had won a bid on the Rio Diamante 
hydroelectric complex in Argentina. This bid is part of 
Argentina's privatization drive in the electric production 
field. EDF joined an Argentine bank, the Bank of Galicia, for 
this bid. EDF's bid totaled $32 million. EDF will hold 51 
percent of the shares of the concessionary company. (Buenos 
Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 1459 GMT 5 Apr 94)

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 4 May (EFE) -- Five dead, eight wounded, 
and several "missing" is the preliminary result of the last four 
days of social conflict in the confrontation between the 
government and the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) who, backed 
by peasants, partially paralyzed the country with the blockade 
of roads seven days ago. 
  The talks between the government and the COB made great 
progress early this morning but later the rupture seemed 
imminent as a result of the insults against President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada by peasant leader Evo Morales during the 
negotiations. 
  "If Morales does not apologize" to the president "we will 
break off the negotiations" said Government Minister German 
Quiroga at Government House. 
  Meanwhile, the environment of violence in the rural area 
between the peasants who blockade roads and the passengers who 
want to get to their destination reached its highest peak when a 
group of peasants apparently caused a bus to fall into a 
500-meter cliff killing three people and wounding six. 
  Cochabamba Police Commander Mario Nunez said the bus 
accident 
that took place near Independencia is being investigated to find 
out who is responsible for it. [passage omitted] 
  Peasant Hilarion Mamani was killed by a bullet on 30 April 
in 
a confusing incident during a blockade of the road from Potosi 
to Sucre. The peasants asserted that an armed group of 
civilians broke up the blockade with shots and tear gas but the 
government denies any participation. 
  The peasant leaders of Potosi Department said that today 
they 
will march to Potosi to request the release of the peasants 
under arrest and to enquire about those missing. 
  Felix Santos, executive secretary of the General Trade Union 
Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia (CSUTCB), said the 
whereabouts of about 12 peasants of Potosi is unknown. 
  Another unidentified individual died during a clash between 
peasants who closed the road from Sucre to Cochabamba and a 
group of passengers desperate to get to their destination. 
  The Chuquisaca prefect (governor) admitted that some people 
were wounded but noted that no one reported any death during 
blockades in Chuquisaca Department, which is now isolated 
because of the official closure of roads and highways. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] members yesterday 
staged a protest demonstration in downtown Sucre. The 
demonstration, which was followed by a rally held at 25 Mayo 
Square, harshly criticized the government. 
  [Begin unidentified union leader recording] We want to 
repudiate the attitude of government officials in Potosi who 
fired shots at fellow peasants [words indistinct] as a result of 
which two peasants, one journalist and one union leader were 
seriously injured. [end recording] 
  Later the demonstrators headed for the police precinct 
building where they demanded the release of student leader 
Panfilo Lora. A clash almost ensued and this compelled the 
police to use tear gas to disperse the demonstrations. Here is 
what the local police commander said. 
  [Begin police commander recording] In view of the aggressive 
attitude adopted by the demonstrators, we had no other 
alternative than to restore order. [end recording] 
  After this incident, student leader Panfilo Lora was 
released. 
  [Begin Panfilo Lora recording] I was held incommunicado for 
five days, which is in open violation of the law. 
  Father Mauricio Tocardif, the general director of the Accion 
Cultural Loyola, has demanded that Bolivian officials conduct a 
full investigation into the death of reputed journalist 
Francisco Cruz, the organizer of the Hazlo Potosi program. 
  [Begin Tocardif recording] All sectors with the law in hand, 
must clarify this situation, find those guilty, and let the law 
decide what should be done. No one should take justice into his 
own hands nor adopt violent attitudes that do not lead to any 
positive or useful solutions. [end recording] 
  The government has reported that Potosi peasant Hilarion 
Mamani was killed by shots fired by a .22 caliber revolver which 
is not the type gun used by either the police or Armed Forces. 
  The official government report states that Mamani was killed 
during a clash among those setting up roadblocks.

<F P=106> [Report from Potosi] </F>
  [Text] The Potosi Civic Committee has decreed mourning at 
the departmental level and suspended all activities in view of 
the death of another peasant. After an exhaustive debate, the 
Potosi Civic Committee board last night decided to demand that 
the government investigates the violent incidents against 
peasants. They also demand that legislators summon the Justice 
and Peace Committee, and that the congressional human rights 
committee send representatives to Potosi to investigate the 
killings of two peasants. Moreover, people fear the fate of 11 
peasants who have been reported missing. 
  In view of this, mourning has been decreed at the 
departmental level and all activities have been suspended. The 
Civic Committee also summoned all citizens to attend the funeral 
procession today at 1600 at the general cemetery. 
  Peasant leaders also reported that peasants will march on 
the 
city. Cristobal Quiri, leader of the Potosi branch of General 
Trade Union Confederation of Bolivian Peasant Workers [CSUTCB], 
reported that peasants marching on the city will be arriving 
today at 1000 to demand the release of those arrested and to 
clarify the situation of the missing. 
  Francisco Cruz was one of those reported missing. He was 
found dead at the local morgue. The police found his body in a 
garbage dump in (Pacla-Pacla). Cruz's body shows signs of 
torture. Francisco Cruz was a member of a journalist union in 
his capacity as reporter [words indistinct]. In view of this, 
journalists have asked officials to perform an autopsy which 
will be performed today at 0800 at the general cemetery. 
Journalists will later stage a demonstration to protest over 
the constant harassments to which they are subjected at the hand 
of government repressive organizations, seeking to involve them 
in terrorism and rebellion. 
  The police found an unidentified body at a garbage dump. An 
anonymous call placed through the 110 telephone number reported 
the presence of an unidentified male body at a garbage dump. 
The forensic doctor determined the man died from alcohol 
intoxication. 
  Potosi Police Commander Colonel Roberto Foronda Franco said: 
  [Begin recording] [Forondo Franco] (?The body was not 
removed 
today) but on 1 May. At the time Forensic Doctor Ramiro Ruiz 
established that an unidentified male, about 35 years old, had 
died of alcoholic intoxication (?after he had) fallen off a 
cliff. It is presumed the man died about three days ago, that 
is, on 29 April. 
  After the local settlers informed the police, the police 
precinct sent [words indistinct] and the forensic doctor went to 
the site to remove the body. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What was the precise location of 
this 
incident? 
  [Forondo Franco] First of all I must specify that this 
[words 
indistinct] 72 hours before the police intervention. The body 
was removed from a large city garbage dump, about 5 km (?from 
the city) at a place called (Pacla Pacla) [words indistinct]. 
[end recording] 
  According to CSUTCB leaders, the unidentified body is that 
of 
Francisco Cruz.

  [Excerpts] The Bolivian Labor Federation [COB] and the 
government reached agreement before dawn today. The only 
pending issue is the approval by the COB plenum meeting of the 
agreement sometime this morning. 
  This means roadblocks will be lifted. This agreement must 
still be approved by the COB, the top-ranking Bolivian union 
central. We hope this decision will be made by noon today. 
Nevertheless, the final agreement was signed before dawn today. 
We will be confirming this report carried by the FIDES and 
JHATA news agencies. The following is a report by Nicolas [not 
further identified]: 
  [Nicolas] COB-government negotiations continue despite 
several stumbling blocks in solving the workers' demands and 
thus ending the social conflict. At 1930 yesterday, 
negotiations were suspended and a possible rupture seemed 
imminent following criticism by the executive branch against 
Coca Farmers leader Evo Morales [as heard] who said: 
  [Begin Morales recording] However, [words indistinct] when 
peasants are blocking roads, and workers are fasting and on the 
streets protesting against the government [words indistinct] on 
their day, 1 of May, the president was on vacation. This is all 
very fine, but he should have been heeding the problems of the 
working class on 1 May, Labor Day [passage indistinct] [end 
recording] 
  This term annoyed the executive branch very much. Government 
Minister German Quiroga stated that if Evo Morales did not 
withdraw his statement negotiations would be suspended. This 
prompted a reaction from labor leaders like Mine Workers Union 
leader Edgar Ramirez who said it was another way by the 
government to continue delaying negotiations. 
  [Begin Ramirez recording] The government has all along tried 
to win more time to surely adopt some measures. In the middle 
of an agenda on mining issues, the government suddenly asked 
Comrade Evo Morales to withdraw a statement he made yesterday. 
[end recording] 
  In view of this, the COB plenum summoned for 1500 yesterday 
was suspended until 0900 today. 
  As time passed, amid some confusion, the COB and Evo Morales 
sent a letter to the executive branch in which the coca farmers 
leader excuses himself and explains his statement. [passage 
omitted] 
  The letter was handed to the executive branch. In view of an 
almost unofficial excuse, the COB and the government resumed 
negotiations at 1930 to define some pending issues including the 
approval by coca farmers of the establishment of a ministerial 
committee on coca industrialization. [passage omitted] 
  It is expected the COB plenum meeting will solve the social 
conflict unleashed three weeks ago. 
  [Studio announcer] Here is a report by Jaime Murillo with 
Peasant Leader Felix Santos. The roadblocks must be lifted 
gradually. 
  [Murillo] COB leaders and government officials before dawn 
today signed some important documents. This means that the 
social problem currently affecting the country is about to be 
solved. I will now speak by phone with Felix Santos, a 
high-ranking leader of the National Confederation of Bolivian 
Peasant Workers [CNTCB]. He will give us a more detailed 
report. Good morning. 
  [Santos] Good morning to all Radio Fides listeners. We want 
to explain what is happening to all our comrades and to all 
those who are blocking roads. 
  Today at 0416 we solved all the issues raised by (?each 
member of) the confederation. In view of this, different CNTCB 
commissions have been dispatched to Chapare, Potosi, Chuquisaca, 
and Santa Cruz. They will be arriving at about 1030 today. 
These commissions have been instructed to inform the local 
CNTCB boards so that they may decide (?whether or not to lift) 
roadblocks. A solution will be achieved possibly by noon today. 
This was decided in this last-minute meeting between the COB, 
the government and the CNTCB. Agreement was reached during this 
meeting. However, until this decision is approved we will 
continue the roadblocks. According to reports I have, we will 
be in permanent contact with the grass roots to explain this 
agreement. The grass roots will be contacted to explain this 
agreement and the conflict will be solved. [passage omitted] 
  [Murillo] You have said the CNTCB executive board met after 
signing an agreement with the government. Does this mean the 
peasants support the agreement and the roadblocks will be lifted 
as of noon today? 
  [Santos] This will be done after we have contacted our grass 
roots. We have signed an agreement among coca producers and 
another understanding on the Potosi issue. [passage omitted] 
  Once the grass roots have discussed these agreements, they 
will inform their decision to COB by noon. Meanwhile, the 
roadblocks continue. 
  [Murillo] Have you discussed the deaths of some peasants 
with 
the government? 
  [Santos] Yes, a high-level commission has been established 
to 
investigate these killing and its members will be going to the 
sites later today. The commission comprises representatives 
from the Chamber of Deputies constitutional committee, 
legislators, human rights organizations, [words indistinct], the 
COB, the government minister and the CNTCB. This commission 
will go to Potosi to investigate. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After several weeks of negotiations, the government 
and coca growers have finally reached an agreement. 
  According to coca grower leaders, 80 percent of their 
demands 
will be honored with the signature of the agreements at dawn 
today. It is hoped, however, that these agreements will indeed 
be put into practice. 
  The negotiations with the government have resulted in one 
decree and two ministry resolutions. The decree establishes the 
equal participation of coca growers in the National Development 
Fund, Fonaral. One of the resolutions provides for the 
compulsory eradication only of new plantations; the second 
resolution, to be implemented immediately, provides for the open 
marketing and industrialization of coca leaf. The peasants, in 
exchange, have agreed to lift the road blockades. [recorded 
passage indistinct] 
  This morning the coca grower leaders traveled to El Chapare 
and the coca production areas to announce the agreement reached 
with the government and to suspend the pressure tactics, such as 
road blockades, adopted by the peasants.

  [Text] Although some sectors have reached an agreement with 
the government, the Bolivian Labor Federation [COB] says that 
there are still several pending issues. 
  The COB's nationwide meeting was supposed to continue today 
with the purpose of assessing the government's last salary 
increase offer, among other issues. However, at the request of 
the miners' confederation, who want to negotiate their demands 
with the government first, the meeting was postponed until 
tomorrow. 
  This morning the COB leaders said the agreement signed 
between the government and the coca growers does not mean that 
everything has been solved. The blockades have been lifted, but 
the hunger strikers continue their measures. Still pending are 
11 missing peasants, two deaths, 20 rural teachers under arrest, 
the miners' demands, and the request for a salary hike. 
  The COB has still not answered the latest offer by the 
government of a 9 percent salary increase. [recorded passage 
indistinct] 
  Although some sectors have accepted the government's offer, 
such as the health workers, the COB, during its meeting 
tomorrow, will continue to assess the 9 percent salary hike 
offered by the government. 
  La Paz teachers have organized a protest rally for this 
afternoon to demand the release of the 20 rural teachers under 
arrest.

<F P=106> [Interview with Carlos Miranda, national secretary of </F>
energy; place and date not given; first three paragraphs are 
PRESENCIA introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Confident that Bolivia's geography offers great 
advantages for natural gas, National Secretary of Energy Carlos 
Miranda is enthusiastic about converting Bolivia into a center 
to supply gas to Latin America's southern cone for the next 50 
years. 
  Not only is he responsible for hydrocarbons, but also 
electricity and other energy sources, like wind and solar power, 
which he believes should be the ones Bolivia uses most in the 
future. 
  At the same time, he is preparing to begin the process of 
privatizing the companies in this sector: YPFB [Bolivian 
Government Oil Deposits] and ENDE [National Electricity 
Enterprise]; to continue negotiations to build the gas pipeline 
to Brazil; to oversee compliance of the accords with Argentina; 
and to analyze the possibilities of selling gas to Paraguay and 
Chile. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Gas Routes </H5>
  [PRESENCIA] You have been one of the promoters of the 
project 
to convert Bolivia into a center for supplying gas to the 
Southern Cone. What is that project based on? 
  [Miranda] The vision that we have (I can no longer say that 
I 
have, for it seems that everybody has adopted this view) is that 
for natural gas, our geographic position in the center of the 
continent is an advantage. We are a sort of Latin American 
Tibet. To the west lie the Andes, a formidable barrier; to the 
north and east, the great green barrier of the Amazon forests; 
and to the south, thousands of kilometers of pampas. And we are 
right in the middle. 
  While we have blamed a large part of our troubles on this 
landlocked position, I believe we have a special edge for 
natural gas because on both coasts--that is, toward the Atlantic 
and the Pacific--we have two neighbors with structural energy 
shortages, which means that they are not expected to be able to 
provide all the energy they need for their own consumption. To 
the south is Argentina, the third or fourth leading consumer of 
gas in the world, proportionally: 40 percent of the energy 
Argentina and Brazil consume is gas. So we have two large 
potential markets and one large real market to the south. 
  That is the origin of the concept that Bolivia may become a 
gas supply and distribution center, for we also have Peru with 
large gas deposits in Camisea. Let me repeat this: our 
geographic position and those markets, plus the availability of 
resources, make those prospects possible. 
  How is all this taking shape? We are starting with Brazil. 
PETROBRAS [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] has submitted its 
engineering costs study to us. 
  [PRESENCIA] Is the engineering costs study for the gas 
pipeline from its border to Sao Paulo or does it include the 
entire pipeline? 
  [Miranda] It includes the entire pipeline. Actually, the 
study covers the gas pipeline for the Rio Grande (Santa 
Cruz)-Campinas-Sao Paulo-Curitiba-Porto Alegre line; this gas 
pipeline is not going to supply only Sao Paulo, but the entire 
Brazilian southeast. It opens up to us both the Sao Paulo market 
and the market in southern Brazil, its most productive area. 
  To the south, we have been supplying gas to Argentina for 
over 20 years. The result of our latest trip is that we now have 
a supplemental accord for hydrocarbons. We have worked out a 
great concept here: hydrocarbons and their by-products from 
Bolivia can flow to Argentina free of taxes and without any 
tariff or paratariff barriers, and vice versa. Our view is that 
while we are suppliers to Argentina, at some given moment we may 
also be purchasers from Argentina or transporters of Argentine 
gas to Brazil or other points. 
  [PRESENCIA] But by eliminating tariffs, are we not hurting 
ourselves, especially when acting as a distribution center? 
  [Miranda] No; we would be doing ourselves no favor if we put 
tariffs on gas that comes into Bolivia to be sent on to other 
markets. We want gas to flow through Bolivia "as fluidly as 
possible." 
  The gas pipeline system that we have now, as well as the 
projected system, are designed to create a large closed circuit 
on the Atlantic coast, where gas can flow in any direction. 
  [PRESENCIA] Give us an example of the advantages for Bolivia 
of transporting Argentine gas to Brazil. 
  [Miranda] Making maximum use of our infrastructure that has 
been built so that it can be expanded. 
  [PRESENCIA] Will a toll fee be charged? 
  [Miranda] Of course! 
  [PRESENCIA] Who will set the rates? 
  [Miranda] That will be determined at the precise time the 
operation is conducted. But such fees are a fully accepted 
practice all over the world. We also plan to go to Chile, and 
this gas from northern Argentina has to flow through Bolivia to 
enter Chile too. The Argentines are going to build a gas 
pipeline to Santiago. We plan to go to Antofagasta; it is my 
goal to have this circuit also completed by 2015 or 2020. 
  These are large markets; the gas will come from Bolivia's 
reserves, from northern Argentina, and from Comisea (Peru), and 
Bolivia will serve as the gas supply and distribution center. 
  [PRESENCIA] What does that mean in terms of volumes, 
dimensions, and money? 
  [Miranda] With what we have now, by using 3.4 trillion we 
can 
supply Brazil with 560 million cubic feet of gas per day. That 
means that if we have 10 times more, we can supply the entire 
system, in the long term, with 5.6 billion cubic feet a day. 
  [PRESENCIA] With our own reserves? 
  [Miranda] With our own reserves. 
  [PRESENCIA] What does that represent in time? 
  [Miranda] It will mean 20 uninterrupted years, and with the 
Bolivian reserves that may come to 33. If we add the reserves 
from northern Argentina in this integrated system, plus the 
Camisea reserves, we are talking about a gas pipeline system 
that could handle about 50 trillion cubic feet a day for 20 to 
50 years. 
  [PRESENCIA] What does this mean in terms of money? 
  [Miranda] We are getting into some very special calculations 
and speculations. We will say the following: the 215 million 
cubic feet that we now send to Argentina represents $100 million 
in revenues a year. So right away the Brazilian business will be 
more than $250 million a year. The problem is determining how 
much gas will cost in the long term. But at constant prices, we 
are talking about eight times what we can send to Brazil, that 
is $1.6 billion a year in 20 years, in a gradual process that 
will continue to grow. 
  Let us not forget that gas is the fossil fuel of the 21st 
century. The data show that everybody is trying to move as much 
toward gas as possible, because it is the least polluting fuel. 
Moreover, it has a stable and permanent supply. 
  To recap these ideas: our geographic position with markets 
around us, and natural resources in and near Bolivia (northern 
Argentina and Peru) make it possible to plan this large network, 
and in very conservative figures, we are speaking of this order 
of magnitude. 
  [PRESENCIA] Geologically, what will happen when this energy 
supply comes to an end? Will it be necessary to change the 
energy matrix? 
  [Miranda] Yes, but that is at least 50 years in the future. 
What happens to the other energy sources? That is why I speak of 
gas fundamentally as energy for export, for our most abundant 
resource is hydroelectric power. We should export gas and 
generate our own energy hydroelectrically to the greatest extent 
possible. 
  Let me point out that along with this gas production, we 
estimate that while we have 22 trillion cubic feet of gas still 
remaining to be discovered in the country, we estimate that we 
also have about 4 billion barrels of petroleum, so I am talking 
about another 40 to 50 years of petroleum as well. 
  We should not address the problem by asking what will happen 
when our petroleum or gas are depleted, for we are talking about 
a time frame of at least 50 years. That same situation is true 
all over the world. Everything now known about hydrocarbon 
reserves and consumption on a global level shows that up to 2040 
the figure is certain. From that point forward it is very 
difficult to foresee. 
  The image of a nonrenewable resource that is going to come 
to 
an end is relative, for at the same time a number of substitutes 
have to come in. Work is being done on other fuels like 
hydrogen, and others are being sought. But right now, in global 
terms, the world remains dependent on hydrocarbons as its great 
energy source, and in national terms, we are in the same 
position and have a horizon similar to the world position, 
perhaps a tiny bit beyond that. 
<H5>  Gas Pipeline Being Built </H5>
  [PRESENCIA] How are negotiations going for gas sales to 
Brazil? 
  [Miranda] This is the situation now. First, PETROBRAS has 
defined how it wants to bring the entire project to Porto 
Alegre. A very detailed engineering cost study has been received 
and the general feeling that we have, that they gave us, is that 
despite the World Bank's objections, the gas pipeline, first of 
all, is Latin America's biggest energy project, and that is 
extremely important. Second, it has such appeal to any investor 
that they are sure that despite the World Bank's objections, 
financing will be arranged at terms that are acceptable for the 
investor and for us (the producers and consumers). 
  Obviously, it would be easier with the World Bank, but the 
president of PETROBRAS told me that when they were going to 
build the Itaipu dam, the bank raised similar and many more 
objections, but they went ahead and built Itaipu, which is 
larger than the gas pipeline project, so he was quite sure that 
this project will go ahead. 
  [PRESENCIA] What might the problems be in PETROBRAS? There 
was said to be internal opposition to the project. 
  [Miranda] The problem is that PETROBRAS, constitutionally, 
holds a monopoly on the import and supply of hydrocarbons in 
Brazil. That led the World Bank to raise that objection. 
  The problem is in the hands of the Brazilian Congress. Until 
15 May, they are going to be reforming their Constitution and 
they are studying that and many other reforms. There is a strong 
inclination to take the monopoly on the import, transport, and 
marketing of hydrocarbons in Brazil away from PETROBRAS. 
  Where is it going to end up? We do not know, as this is an 
internal Brazilian problem. Some indications seem to suggest 
that PETROBRAS might retain a large part of its monopoly, but 
for gas it might no longer hold that monopoly. 
  If that happens, the financing problem would be much easier, 
because in the end, that will result in repayment guarantees for 
the loans they get to build the pipeline. With the monopoly, the 
view from outside is that PETROBRAS is not a sufficient 
guarantor, but if it loses the monopoly, those guarantees would 
exist. 
  So far, we know of three large consortia that would 
definitely like to compete to build the project. These include 
Enron, the BHP, Tenneco, and British Gas group, which has 
visited the country, and according to PETROBRAS, the French 
group TOTAL. 
  [PRESENCIA] Would this be with or without PETROBRAS as the 
majority enterprise? 
  [Miranda] Yes, it would be with or without PETROBRAS holding 
the majority. 
  [PRESENCIA] Is YPFB able to handle that job for the 
Brazilian 
part? 
  [Miranda] Yes, there would be no problem on the Bolivian 
side. 
  [PRESENCIA] Then why are you saying that the project will be 
built with private capital? 
  [Miranda] Because we decided that this project will be 
carried out fundamentally--not exclusively--with private 
investment. 
  [PRESENCIA] Why? 
  [Miranda] Because there is now no intention for YPFB to get 
involved in this type of investment. YPFB has no access to 
financing sources. One reason for its privatization is the 
closeoff of concessionaire multinational capital continuing with 
the state as a contractor. 
  [PRESENCIA] How much do you calculate will be invested on 
the 
Bolivian side? 
  [Miranda] About $450 million. Of that amount, half will 
easily be spent on materials and at least about $100 million on 
labor. 
  [PRESENCIA] And the Brazilian investment? 
  [Miranda] To Porto Alegre, about $1.6 billion. The total 
project is on the order of $2 billion. 
  [PRESENCIA] Does the Bolivian investment include the supply 
of gas to be exported? 
  [Miranda] No, that is another item. For the supply to the 
pipe, it is estimated--with a fairly good degree of 
precision--that we will invest about $700 million over the next 
10 years to develop fields, build feeder lines, and put a large 
plant in Rio Grande. 
  [PRESENCIA] To whom will the gas pipeline belong? 
  [Miranda] To the transporting enterprise, but our 
legislation 
will state that any gas producer, not just YPFB, may enter this 
pipeline. We have to see two things: that YPFB has the sales 
contract, it must provide; and the transporter will be the one 
that has the line and carries the gas. This line will be a 
"common carrier," so any enterprise will have the right to enter 
the line by paying its toll fee. All this, controlled by the 
regulatory agency, will be set up as part of the privatization 
process. 
<H5>  Argentine Compensation </H5>
  [PRESENCIA] Could you explain the contents of the agreement 
that has been signed in Argentina? 
  [Miranda] We have signed a three-year sales contract. We are 
going to increase the volume of gas a little. Before, we were 
selling 200 million cubic feet and we are going to raise that to 
215, and we are also increasing the "take or pay." 
  [PRESENCIA] What is "take or pay"? 
  [Miranda] These things are not absolutely precise; there are 
seasonal fluctuations in demand and other factors, so "take or 
pay" means that the purchaser is obliged to pay the seller for a 
minimum volume of what has been contracted, even if he does not 
take the entire amount. This is called "take or pay," meaning 
that even if you do not receive, you still have to pay. In the 
petroleum world, gas contracts are written with "take or pay" 
clauses of 80 or 75 percent. We got 92.5 percent. 
  [PRESENCIA] So if you do not use the gas, you pay us 92.5 
percent of what was agreed? 
  [Miranda] Of the volume of which we spoke. The previous 
contract had an 85 percent "take or pay" clause. 
  [PRESENCIA] What does Argentina do with that unused gas? 
  [Miranda] It puts it into its system, which it has to sell, 
and if not it will still have to pay for it. Fortunately, we 
have not had to use a "take or pay" with Argentina. They took 
everything we sent. We are now beginning a seasonal pricing 
mode: in winter it costs a little more and in summer a little 
less. The first year the price is going to be 1.05 [denomination 
not given] in summer and 1.10 in winter; the second year, 1.10 
and 1.15; the third year, 1.15 and 1.20. And the door has been 
left open so that in the future, prices can be set based on 
variations in fuel oil prices. But that is still a potential 
arrangement. 
  [PRESENCIA] The contract also includes the possibility of 
importing and exporting other by-products.... 
  [Miranda] Yes. As a consequence of the termination of the 
old 
arrangement and starting new accounts, it was agreed that 
Bolivian gas could enter the deregulated Argentine market 
without any tariff and that it would be treated like Argentine 
gas. In exchange, Bolivia also lowered tariff barriers on all of 
Argentina's petroleum by-products until the year 2002. 
  The change that has been introduced means that there is now 
no time limit, it is indefinite. So this creates a free energy 
market between Bolivia and Argentina, bearing in mind that we 
are becoming a gas distribution center. 
  [PRESENCIA] In those conditions, is it possible that 
Argentina may send us gasoline that is cheaper than YPFB's 
gasoline? 
  [Miranda] I do not think so, theoretically no. Do not forget 
that when we deregulate the market, which we are going to have 
to do in 120 days, we are going to enter a new system of setting 
prices in Bolivia. 
  There will no longer be transfers from YPFB to the Treasury 
(which come to 65 percent); instead, there will be the ICE 
[Specific Consumption Tax]. So from now on, it will be the 
company's efficiency that will enable it to obtain the lowest 
possible cost. Right now, we are bringing diesel fuel from 
Argentina which, since there is no ICE or transfer, is an 
excellent deal. But when we start the ICE system, we are going 
to have an intermediate import and export parity model that will 
make it almost a matter of indifference whether it is a Bolivian 
or imported product. 
  [PRESENCIA] Luckily, gasoline prices did not go up at the 
start of the year.... 
  [Miranda] That is part of the reason why. 
  [PRESENCIA] But will they go up automatically? 
  [Miranda] No, we do not expect prices to rise, because in 
this system what interests us most is that the ICE replaces 
YPFB's 65 percent transfer. It will be a tax in the full meaning 
of the word. Then YPFB will be able to compete perfectly. It has 
been hard to compete with YPFB, because all the pipelines are 
set up for domestic consumption, and bringing products in from 
other countries to Bolivia is difficult. We do not believe that 
will cause major disruptions; perhaps in some products there may 
be some things that do not work smoothly, but I do not think it 
will cause any problems for the Treasury. 
  [PRESENCIA] And for the citizens? 
  [Miranda] Or for the citizens, for if the YPFB product plus 
the ICE is too expensive, the imported product will take away 
its market. 
  [PRESENCIA] What does it mean that YPFB and YPFSA 
[Government 
Oil Deposits, S.A.] (of Argentina) can join in an association? 
  [Miranda] The association contract that has been initialized 
and that will take effect very soon is our first such contract 
in Bolivia. It means that YPFB signs an association contract 
with YPFSA of Argentina. YPFSA conducts the operation at its own 
risk, using its own resources. When there is commercial 
production, YPFB has the option of working in association or 
continuing with an operating contract like the ones we already 
have, and for everything that has been invested, YPFB only 
acknowledges the costs of commercially exploitable wells. 
  [PRESENCIA] One last issue with Argentina. They have made a 
payment to us of $84 million. Why? 
  [Miranda] Basically, they have given us $84 million, of 
which 
$50 million is fully and totally available, and $34 million is 
to be used for border development projects. 
  [PRESENCIA] Why are they making this payment? 
  [Miranda] Our proposal goes like this: "Gentlemen, as you 
are 
our sole gas market, you set the price (this is the truth; as we 
do not have anyone else to sell it to, they set the price), and 
as you put us in the position of keeping all of your economic 
activity balanced, you have to compensate us." That was the 
rationale behind that proposal. 
<H5>  We Are Changing the Nation </H5>
  Carlos Miranda was inevitably asked about the privatization 
of YPFB and ENDE, which are now under his stewardship. 
  In both cases, he expressed confidence that this process 
will 
move forward, although slowly. 
  He said YPFB's value is between $1.5 and $2 billion, but 
there are some variables that could cause its value to rise. 
  [PRESENCIA] Who will be the owner of the pipelines? 
  [Miranda] The party who privatizes it: the state is 
completely withdrawing. 
  [PRESENCIA] What does the clause in the Privatization Law 
mean, which says that hydrocarbon resources remain the "property 
of the state and are inalienable and nontransferable"? 
  [Miranda] That means that the state, when it privatizes or 
awards areas through contracts or licensing arrangements, is not 
giving away the reserves, which remain under its control. 
  [PRESENCIA] What does market deregulation mean for 
hydrocarbons? 
  [Miranda] Deregulation will be a gradual process. In a 
country full of ports it is very easy to do this; in Bolivia the 
process is quite complicated. At first, it will mean that YPFB's 
transfers will be compensated with both sales and production 
taxes, and that prices will not be set by decree, as they are 
now, but by the workings of supply and demand. 
  [PRESENCIA] YPFB now has contracts with a number of 
companies. Will the privatization process include them? 
  [Miranda] One issue that is being discussed is whether we 
will privatize YPFB by itself or with its contracts as well. If 
we take the first route, the companies will be able to sell 
their products. If we choose the second route, everything is 
going to pass through the hands of the privatized YPFB. 
  Those two positions both have their pros and cons. If we 
privatize YPFB with its contracts, we are replacing a public 
monopoly with a private monopoly. Of course, here the regulatory 
agencies will be greatly involved in order to avoid any unfair 
consumer practices. That is what concerns us. The other model 
will be simpler, as they will enter a full competition system. 
<H5>  Electricity </H5>
  Then Miranda explained the benefits of privatizing ENDE, 
even 
though the company now generates profits and performs a social 
function by undertaking unprofitable projects, especially in 
rural areas. 
  "First, ENDE is now a financially sound company as the 
Treasury has covered over $100 million of its debts. To continue 
expanding, ENDE is in the same position as YPFB. It would have 
to turn to external financing that is closed for this type of 
project, so the possibility of ENDE's expansion, not in the 
short term, as it has financing for the next two or three years, 
might be a problem." 
  He added that "the model is adjusted so that Bolivia can 
substantially increase the rate of growth of its Gross Domestic 
Product. That will present major energy requirements, as we will 
need energy in order to grow. ENDE can handle a growth of 3 
percent, but if we raise this rate to 6, 7, 8, or 9 percent, 
there will be big financing problems, and that is one of the 
fundamental reasons for privatizing ENDE." 
  "By privatizing ENDE--and we are quite sure about the 
model--we want to create the conditions for healthy competition." 
<H5>  Rural Electrification: the Third Arm </H5>
  Miranda explained that rural electrification is complicated 
"because the problem of rural areas is not simply electricity. 
In essence, it is a problem of poverty: of being able to bring 
energy in any form (electricity, LPG [Liquefied Petroleum Gas], 
kerosene, unconventional forms of energy), and then having the 
ability to pay for it." 
  To deal with that situation, his office is working on a plan 
to establish the DIFER [Office of Rural Energy Promotion], which 
will serve as a link between organizations like NGO's 
[nongovernmental organizations], foundations, and multilateral 
and private institutions, with municipalities, in order to 
finance specific projects in specific areas. 
  Local participation will be involved in that process 
because, 
with that, communities will be able to determine precisely what 
their needs are and develop appropriate projects, which will not 
necessarily involve electricity. 
  He made it clear that that plan "is outside the 
privatization 
plan, but it is not intended that the state will do everything, 
for that has been a failure." 
  Enthusiastically, he said this is "our third big plan and it 
is the one which presents the greatest challenges, because to 
set loose, absolutely in the hands of market forces, almost 50 
percent of the rural population would not be very prudent. We 
need to develop a system to give rural inhabitants access to 
energy." 
  He insisted that "this still needs to be worked out, for we 
have to coordinate this very well with all the social 
development programs. We have to recognize the problem of 
agriculture, the problem of energy for agriculture is the 
problem of poverty. This is a slow and complex process, but we 
are putting much faith in the process."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 5 May. 
  The Industry and Commerce Secretariat reported that non- 
traditional exports totalled $76 million in the first quarter, 
an increase of 72 percent compared with the same period last 
year, when it was $44 million. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 26 
Apr 94 p B5) 
  The Bolivian Central Bank, BCB, reported that the foreign 
reserve account registered a $18 million deficit in the first 
quarter. Income totalled $365 million, while expenses rose to 
$383.1 million. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 26 Apr 94 p 9) 
  The BCB reported that the debt owed to private banks dropped

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Trade Ethics"] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton is correct in promoting 
exports, which are responsible for 80 percent of U.S. economic 
growth and also for more than 12 million direct jobs. 
  But as a world trade leader and defender of ethical, free, 
and fair competition in international trade, the United States 
should be the first to observe the rules, and set an example of 
what it preaches. 
  Following the donation of $800 per ton of frozen chicken 
exported to Arab countries, the U.S. Government has now decided 
to grant a bonus, within the same system of subsidies (Export 
Enhancement Program), of $47 per ton to help sell 798,000 tons 
of wheat to the PRC. 
  The United States thus has no authority to demand within the 
GATT/World Trade Organization that developing countries (like 
Brazil, India, etc.) be condemned for "social dumping" for 
having lower salaries in their export production sectors than do 
the industrialized countries.

  [Text] Brasilia, 3 May (EFE) -- Official sources reported 
that the presidents of Brazil and Angola, Itamar Franco and 
Eduardo dos Santos, met today in Brasilia. They discussed the 
Angolan civil war and Nelson Mandela's election as the new South 
African president. 
  Dos Santos, who has been visiting the resort of Ilheus, in 
Bahia State, for the last 15 days, paid Franco a courtesy visit. 
The two presidents analyzed the political situation of the 
southern African countries and other matters of common interest. 
  A presidential spokesman said: "It was an informal meeting 
between the presidents of two friendly countries." 
  Franco and Dos Santos evaluated the electoral victory of 
Mandela and of his party, the African National Congress. They 
considered this victory positive from the political point of 
view of Angola and the other countries of the southern region of 
the African continent. 
  The two presidents also exchanged ideas about the first 
summit of Portuguese-speaking countries, which will be held in 
Lisbon in June. The summit will be attended by the presidents 
and chiefs of state of Brazil, Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, 
Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and Sao Tome and Principe.

  [Text] Brasilia, 4 May (EFE) -- Brazilian President Itamar 
Franco today praised his future South African counterpart, 
Nelson Mandela, for his victory in the recent elections and for 
his epic fight in favor of democracy and against racial 
discrimination. 
  Franco, who is 62, sent Mandela a 62-line message stating 
that his victory revitalizes freedom, and represents a sign of 
hope for humankind and a historic deed for South Africa that 
will have repercussions over the entire African continent. 
  Franco told Mandela: "The long epic battle Your Excellency 
and the African National Congress have fought against racial 
discrimination has been closely followed from this side of the 
Atlantic Ocean, with a profound spirit of solidarity." 
  Franco pointed out that the new political panorama will make 
it possible to promote bilateral relations and cooperation, the 
potential of which he considers to be unexplored. 
  In a note sent to current South African President Frederick 
de Klerk, Franco praised his stature as a statesman, which made 
possible the transition process culminating in the installation 
in South Africa of a multiracial democracy. 
  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim will represent the Brazilian 
president at Mandela's installation ceremony, which will be held 
in the South African capital on 10 May.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Celso Amorim today met French 
ministers and entrepreneurs in Paris. He said that the 
objective of his trip was to strengthen bilateral exchange in 
the areas of technology and trade. 
  From Paris, Minister Celso Amorim will go to Pretoria, South 
Africa, to represent President Itamar Franco at the installation 
ceremony of African leader Nelson Mandela next week. 
  The foreign minister said that Nelson Mandela's electoral 
victory has great political importance for the world. 
  [Begin Amorim recording] This opens important economic 
prospects for Brazil. Two months ago we already sent a 
commercial mission to South Africa. It also opens up broader 
prospects for cooperation with the African continent as a whole. 
  I believe that his election will also be important for the 
Angolan peace process, which is an important objective for 
Brazil. It will also contribute to consolidating the peacemaking 
process in Mozambique. [end recording]

  [Text] Brasilia, 4 May (EFE) -- Official sources reported 
today that the Brazilian Foreign Trade Secretariat will be 
investigating the alleged "dumping" (unfair trade practice) of 
sausage casings imported from Spain and the United States [as 
received]. 
  The case began following a charge presented by the U.S. 
Hoechst company against the Spanish company Viscofan. The two 
companies are competing in the Brazilian sausage casings market, 
which moves $10 million annually. 
  The investigation involves 2 million tons of this material 
imported in 1993. 
  The sausage casings manufactured in Brazil by Hoechst are 
more expensive than those imported from Spain by Viscofan, which 
has businesses in Germany and is looking at opening a factory in 
Brazil. 
  The Foreign Trade Secretariat will also begin an 
investigation by mid-May of wheat imported from Germany at 
subsidized prices. Argentina is the main wheat supplier for 
Brazil.

  [Text] If it is left up to the Military Police [PM] to 
investigate the connections between the illegal numbers lottery 
and international drug trafficking, District Attorney Antonio 
Carlos Biscaia may become frustrated. The investigations have 
stopped and, according to sources from the PM Secret Service 
(P-2), anyone who insists on investigating on his own could be 
punished. Authorizations for cars and agents necessary for 
operations that must be carried out in Bangu, Campos, and Angra 
dos Reis -- where there is a strong indication of links between 
illegal lottery kingpins and drug traffickers -- have been 
canceled. 
  Biscaia, who does not trust the civilian police, is unable 
to 
investigate any charges of drug trafficking links due to lack of 
support from the PM. The P-2 agents have not even analyzed a 
telephone book confiscated in an illegal lottery kingpin's home 
in Praca da Se, Bangu, which contains telephone numbers of the 
Cali cartel in Colombia, the main drug trafficking cartel in the 
world. According to secret service sources, the PM alleges that 
such operations are meant to politically harm former Rio de 
Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola and current Governor Nilo 
Batista. 
  The information leaked by an accountant for illegal lottery 
kingpin Castor de Andrade to the PM secret service -- which 
links Fernando de Miranda Iggnacio, Andrade's son-in-law, who is 
detained at a Polinter [Inter-State Police] precinct, with 
Colombian drug traffickers -- could also not be confirmed, 
because the P-2, with the dismissal of Lieutenant Colonel Marco 
Antonio Paes de Oliveira, has practically been dismantled. The 
most active P-2 agents were transferred to other units or given 
anticipated vacations. 
  According to the same sources, any evidence of the links 
between the illegal lottery and drug trafficking could 
strengthen the district attorney's position and, on the other 
hand, weaken the state government and PDT [Democratic Labor 
Party] politicians mentioned in the lists of the illegal lottery 
kingpins. 
  To worsen the situation, the Federal Police is on strike, 
and 
the information about passport numbers, and arrivals and 
departures from the country, cannot be checked out, not even by 
the prosecutors. For this reason, and to gain time, Biscaia is 
concentrating on the charges of active and passive corruption 
which require only the analysis of computer diskettes and 
accounting books confiscated from the illegal lottery kingpins, 
and which list the names of politicians, prosecutors, judges, 
journalists, artists, and athletes.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 5 May. 
  Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko on 29 April announced that 
Petrobras -- Brazilian Petroleum Corporation -- may no longer 
pass on the cost of oil importation taxes to consumers in the 
price of fuel. The taxes affect the importation of oil and 
by-products. Petrobras has so far paid a 38 percent tax on crude 
oil imports, which was passed on to consumers in the form of 
higher fuel prices. The corporation will now have to absorb the 
cost of this tax. (Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 30 Apr 
94 p 1) 
  The Institute of Nonferrous Metals has reported that in the 
first quarter of 1994 the production of nickel stood at 3,491 
tonnes, and that during the same period in 1993 nickel 
production stood at 3,915 tonnes. These figures show that 
during the first quarter of 1994 Brazilian nickel production 
dropped by 10.82 percent with respect to the same period in 
1993. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 3 May 94 p 14) 
  The last stage of the privatization of the National Iron and 
Steel Company -- CSN -- was concluded during the week ending 23 
April. The shares that still had to be sold, amounting to 9 
percent of the enterprise's capital, were sold in two auctions 
conducted in March and last week. The operation yielded $1.494 
billion. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 28 Apr 
94 p B4) 
  The average general price index stood at 40.91 percent in 
April. This figure stands almost 5 percentage points below the 
45.7 percent rate that was registered in March. (Sao Paulo O 
ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 1 May 94 p A14) 
  Professor Roberto Cavalcanti, of the National Institute for 
Advanced Studies, on 27 April submitted a research paper 
reporting that there are 39.2 million poor people in Brazil, of 
whom 21.7 million are in the northeastern region, and that there 
are 3.1 million poor people in the three southeastern 
metropolitan regions -- Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo 
Horizonte. Cavalcanti considered poor the members of a family 
whose monthly per capita income stood below $35, in values that 
were in force in 1990. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 28 Apr 94 p 10) 
  The balance of trade registered a $1.03 billion surplus in 
March. This figure is 31.97 percent lower than the figure 
registered in March 1993. Ailton Barcellos, executive secretary 
of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, on 27 April reported 
that exports in March 1994 -- which stood at $3.351 billion -- 
dropped by 4.67 percent with respect to March 1993. Imports, 
which stood at $2.321 billion in March 1994, grew by 15.99 
percent. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 28 Apr 
94 p B7) 
  On 29 April Petrobras began operating the 1,027 meter deep 
Marlim-4 oil well in Campos Basin, off the coast of Rio de 
Janeiro. This is Petrobras' deepest underwater oil well. The 
well is part of the Marlim Sur Master Project, in which $34 
million has been invested. Marlim-4 will produce 6,300 barrels 
per day at a cost of $3.45 per barrel. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 2 May 94 p 13)

  [Text] Lima, 5 May (EFE) -- Today, the Peruvian Army and 
police will start patrolling Lima and the port of Callao to 
prevent possible terrorist attacks, as the 14th anniversary of 
the day, 17 May 1980, the Shining Path began its activities 
approaches. 
  Last night, there were four attacks with explosives against 
the offices of the state company Electrolima [Lima Electric 
Power Enterprise] and three other attacks against the Credit 
Bank in Lima, which caused only property damage. 
  According to a military communique, a similar attack took 
place on 3 May in the Military Village of Chorrillos District in 
Lima, with no casualties resulting. 
  On 17 May 1980, one day before the general elections in 
which 
Fernando Belaunde Terry was elected president for the second 
time, a Shining Path group entered the small town of Chuschi, 
Ayacucho Department, and destroyed electoral material. This was 
the first action of the terrorist organization. 
  According to sources from the Counterterrorism Directorate 
(Dincote) cited today by LA REPUBLICA, there is the fear that 
the Shining Path may unleash a campaign of violence in Lima on 
orders from its current chief, Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias 
"Feliciano." 
  There is also the fear that the Shining Path will increase 
its activities in memory of the events of 6, 7, 8, and 9 May 
1992, when the security forces occupied the Canto Grande 
penitentiary in Lima after the terrorists took over the prison. 
  Meanwhile, hundreds of kilometers north of Lima in the 
jungle 
region of Huanuco Department, where a military operation against 
three Shining Path columns is being carried out, a captured 
terrorist, Ely Puertas, alias "Juan," revealed to EXPRESO the 
painful conditions of his colleagues. 
  Puertas says the "Mar Rojo Batallion" he belonged to has 300 
men, many of them civilians who were recruited under the threat 
of death. He added that the Shining Path members are hungry and 
thirsty, as they have only tubers and fruit to eat, and they 
want to take refuge under the repentance law, but the chiefs 
prevent them from doing so. 
  Today, the Peruvian Government extended the state of 
emergency for 60 days in four provinces of the southern Andean 
Apurimac Department "to facilitate the operations against 
terrorism." There are no civil liberties in the emergency 
zones, which are under military control.

  [Text] Lima, 5 May (EFE) -- It was officially reported 
today that a Peruvian military court has annulled the life 
prison sentence imposed in March on drug trafficker Demetrio 
Chavez, aka Vaticano, and has sentenced him to 30 years in 
prison. 
  The maximum sentence for Vaticano was commuted by the 
Supreme 
Court of Military Justice (CSJM) because although it believed 
Vaticano cooperated with terrorist groups, he never participated 
directly in murders. 
  The CSJM, which also sentenced Chavez to pay $50 million in 
compensation to the government, reported that it has been proven 
that Vaticano maintained close links with terrorists, and 
exerted influence on armed groups, especially the Shining Path, 
based on his economic power. 
  "That allowed the Shining Path to intensify actions in that 
zone (the Huallaga Valley) and in several other parts of the 
country, with the resulting selective murders," a document 
released by the CSJM states. 
  The document says Vaticano's influence reached, among other 
zones, the Cuchara Valley, where since 5 April security forces 
have been carrying out a great antisubversive offensive. 
  The Shining Path protected the illegal airports and the 
landings and takeoffs of the airplanes in which Vaticano had 
been sending drugs to Colombia since 1990, the document states. 
In exchange, the drug trafficker gave the Shining Path weapons, 
ammunition, communications equipment, and from $10,000 to 
$20,000 in cash for every airplane that took off with 500 kg of 
cocaine. 
  Demetrio Chavez was arrested on 28 February in Cali, 
Colombia, during an operation coordinated between the Colombian 
and Peruvian authorities, and expelled on the same day to Peru 
as an "undesirable."

  [Text] Lima, 5 May (EFE) -- Peruvian Economy Minister Jorge 
Camet left today for Washington, although his final destination 
is Paris where he will report to the World Bank Consultative 
Group on the progress of the government program against poverty, 
which is being financed by that organization. In 1993, the 
Consultative Group granted Peru aid worth $900 million to fight 
poverty, of which $500 million have already been disbursed. 
  In his stopover in Washington, Camet will meet with Manuel 
Estela, Peruvian delegate before the IDB [Inter-American 
Development Bank] and director of the National Compensation and 
Social Development Fund (Foncodes), who will travel with Camet 
to Paris. During the group's meeting on 9 and 10 May, the 
Peruvian representatives will explain how the funds provided by 
the World Bank are being used. 
  A study will also be made of a report prepared by an IMF 
mission which recently visited Peru to evaluate the degree of 
poverty, Peruvian financial needs, and the functioning of the 
government organizations in charge of the struggle against 
poverty. 
  According to an Economy Ministry source, the main goal of 
the 
Peruvian delegates will be to commit the group to act as a 
promoter of foreign investment in Peru, and especially 
investment for the social sector. 
  The Paris meeting will also be attended by World Bank 
directors; representatives of the governments committed to the 
aid approved last year, such as the United States, Japan, and 
Germany; and delegates from the IMF, the IDB, and the UN 
organizations linked to the struggle against poverty.

  [Excerpts] Santiago, 4 May (EFE) -- Today, some Chilean 
officials and congressmen predicted that complex negotiations 
are required if we are to either sign a free trade agreement 
with the United States or join NAFTA. They all, however, lauded 
the steps taken. 
  On 3 May, Chilean Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat and U.S. 
Trade Representative Michael Kantor agreed in Washington to hold 
preliminary talks by late May and formal negotiations 
tentatively by mid-September. [passage omitted] 
  Senator Sebastian Pinera of the rightist National Renewal 
Party (RN) said the step taken is positive, "and we now expect 
the United States to sit at the negotiating table and make it 
come true." Pinera noted: "There have been many words but few 
accomplishments," adding that "four years have passed since 
(former) President George Bush promised Chile would follow 
Mexico." 
  Juan Salazar, director of economic relations at the Foreign 
Ministry, expressed greater optimism, stating that "Chile is 
prepared" to start negotiations because it meets the 
requirements set by the U.S. Government concerning trade 
agreements. Salazar added that he believes there is a somewhat 
unjustified alarm in Chile about the U.S. requirements because 
the two countries already engaged in consultations and exchanged 
views on legislation, trade procedures, and the degree of 
economic opening. In remarks to the newspaper LA NACION, 
Salazar said: "Chile is at quite an advanced stage in these 
areas. This is why the United States puts us in first place."

  [Text] Santiago, 4 May (EFE) -- Today, Chilean President 
Eduardo Frei met with Inter-American Press Association [IAPA] 
President Raul E. Kraiselburd, who is an Argentine citizen, and 
with other members of the IAPA executive board. 
  The IAPA representatives reiterated to Frei their rejection 
of the requirement that every journalist have a university 
degree to be able to practice journalism in Chile. The 
requirement is included in the new press law proposal the 
executive branch has submitted to Congress. 
  IAPA, which represents owners of 1,300 print media 
organizations in the continent, has repeatedly criticized the 
above requirement through resolutions issued during its 
assemblies. 
  Kraiselburd handed Frei a copy of the Chapultepec 
Declaration, which outlines the IAPA position on freedom of 
expression adopted in a continental meeting held recently in 
Mexico. 
  Attending the meeting with Frei were IAPA directors Andres 
Garcia Lavin of Mexico, Roberto Pulido of Chile, Danilo Arbilla 
of Uruguay, Oliver Clark of Jamaica, and IAPA executive director 
Julio E. Munoz. 
  The IAPA directors are attending an international seminar on 
"Development of Mass Media and Democracy in Latin America and 
the Caribbean." It opened in Santiago on 2 May and is scheduled 
to conclude on 6 May.

  [Excerpt] General Ramon Vega Hidalgo, commander in chief of 
the Chilean Air Force [FACh], has said the institution is 
analyzing Russian aerospace technology and will possibly 
introduce it into the systems it currently possesses. 
  He pointed out that "together with the Russians, we are 
evaluating the possibility of introducing their technology into 
our national systems, and then establishing programs with them." 
He explained that it is a slow process. 
  Gen. Vega reported that for many years the FACh has been 
working on concrete technological programs with U.S. academies 
and universities, and training engineers in electronics, 
communications, and computing, as well as creating new systems 
for the institution. 
  At noon yesterday, the FACh commander in chief granted an 
interview to the media at the end of a ceremony celebrating the 
57th anniversary of the Air War Academy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santiago, 5 May (EFE) -- Chilean Senate President 
Gabriel Valdes will head the official Chilean delegation 
attending next week's inauguration of the leader of the African 
National Congress (ANC) in South Africa, Valdes himself reported 
today. The Christian Democratic Senator said he is very 
satisfied to represent Chile "at an historic event." 
  Valdes stressed the value of democracy, "which has given the 
black South African majority what they could not attain during 
so many decades of bloody fights," and also underlined the 
peaceful elections held last week. 
  The South African people have demonstrated "great devotion 
and respect in expressing their position through elections," the 
Chilean politician said, after which he spoke about the 
personalities of Nelson Mandela and outgoing President Frederik

  Mandela "is the hero of this historic moment," and De Klerk

they were awarded last year.

  [Text] Santiago, 3 May (EFE) -- Today, Argentine Ambassador 
to Santiago Eduardo Iglesias said his country will "warmly 
welcome" Chile's entry into the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur), which comprises Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and 
Paraguay. 
  During a news conference, the ambassador said the decision 
to 
join Mercosur is the exclusive decision of the Chilean 
Government, adding that if it wishes to do so, the Chilean 
Government can study this possibility without any haste. 
  Iglesias voiced satisfaction because he has found, as he put 
it, a new predisposition in the Chilean authorities regarding 
Mercosur, especially in Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat and 
Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia, and in Juan Salazar, the 
director of the International Economic Relations Department of 
the Foreign Ministry. 
  The ambassador said this after confirming that Argentine 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo will make an official visit to 
Santiago on 10 and 11 May, with the main objective of beginning 
"a new style of relations" with Chilean economic officials, 
which he referred to as "Dialogues of the Southern Cone." 
  During his visit, Cavallo will meet with President Eduardo 
Frei Ruiz Tagle. He will also deliver a lecture on the 
Argentine economic process and will hold working meetings with 
his Chilean counterpart Eduardo Aninat. Cavallo will also visit 
"Expomin '94" -- Latin America's main mining fair -- which will 
be held in Santiago next week. 
  Iglesias emphasized that Cavallo and Aninat have known each 
other professionally for 20 years, since the time they studied 
at the U.S. University of Harvard. He said he believes this 
will strengthen bilateral relations, "which are already 
extraordinary." 
  The ambassador added that at an economic level, 
Chilean-Argentine integration has had "fantastic" achievements, 
while bilateral exchange grew five-fold in four years, to $1.2 
billion in 1993. He noted that during the first quarter of 
1994, bilateral exchange grew by 15 percent with respect to the 
same period in 1993, adding that he expects it to reach 
$1.4-billion in 1994.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 5 May. 
  The Central Bank reported that the public sector's foreign 
debt was $19.628 billion through February, of which 64.4 percent 
corresponds to the nonfinancial sector and 25.5 percent to the 
financial institutions. The private sector's debt totalled 
$10.513 billion. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 13 Apr 94 p 7) 
  Budget Director Jose Pablo Arellano said public expenditure 
increased by almost 7 percent in 1993, with savings being 5 
percent of the GDP. He also said social expenses grew 9.5 
percent, and public investment 20 percent. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA 
in Spanish 21 Apr 94 Economic Section p 4) 
  Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia reported that foreign 
investment totalled $804.9 million in the year's first quarter, 
19 percent higher than in the same period of 1993. Mining 
received the highest percentage of the investment, with 66 
percent; services 20.9 percent; industry 7.1 percent; 
construction 2.9 percent; and agriculture 1.5 percent. 
(Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 21 Apr 94 pp B1-B12) 
  The Central Bank reported that the trade balance registered 
a 
$135 million surplus in the year's first quarter as compared 
with the $75.5 million deficit registered during the same period 
in 1993. Exports totalled $2.5254 billion and imports $2.3904 
billion. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 26 Apr 94 pp B1-B6) 
  On 3 May, the Comptroller General's Office established a new 
telephone tariff system which entails a 21 percent reduction in 
fixed monthly rates. This measure will particularly benefit 
those people living in areas surrounding large urban centers.

  [Text] Montevideo, 5 May (EFE) -- The Uruguayan Government 
has decided to unilaterally withdraw from negotiations to 
establish a Common Market of the South [Mercosur] common 
external tariff until Brazil, the largest Mercosur member 
country, clarifies the terms of its proposal to create a 
continental free trade zone. 
  Official sources advised the press of the decision today. 
The decision was made by President Luis Alberto Lacalle at the 
suggestion of Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas. 
  The minister argued that Uruguay must pay dearly for 
maintaining a very high external tariff and cannot permit other 
countries in the region to use the American free trade zone to 
allow products into Brazil "at a significantly lower cost."

  [Excerpt] Brasilia, 5 May (EFE) -- A Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry spokesperson told EFE today that Uruguayan Foreign 
Minister Sergio Abreu today guaranteed his Brazilian colleague, 
Celso Amorim, that Uruguay will not withdraw from the 
negotiations to establish the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur) import tariffs. 
  Abreu got ahold of Amorim in Paris, where he is on an 
official visit, and during a telephone conversation denied a 
report published in Montevideo claiming that Uruguay had decided 
to withdraw from the negotiations due to disagreements over the 
Brazilian initiative to create a free trade zone in South 
America. 
  The Uruguayan delegation today continued its participation 
in 
Mercosur's Common Market Group, the main technical level for the 
integration mechanism, which is meeting this week in the 
Argentine capital. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 5 
May. 
  The construction industry continued to enjoy a boom during 
the first quarter of the year, as shown by increased sales of 
Portland cement for public and private construction, which grew 
by 80 and 11 percent respectively. Sales of gas oil and fuel oil 
dropped by 24 and 56 percent respectively in the first quarter. 
This is an indication of the recession that has been affecting 
the Uruguayan industry for over a year. A 4.3 percent drop in 
the volume of milk processed at pasteurizing plants was also 
registered in the said quarter. There has been an upturn in 
livestock activities during this quarter, as wool exports grew 
by 27 percent and the number of cattle slaughtered increased by 
13.4 percent. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR in Spanish 21 Apr 94 p 9) 
  The executive branch decreed an average 9 percent increase 
in 
gasoline prices. The measure entered into effect at 0000 on 27 
April. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 27 Apr 94 p 1) 
  According to Uruguay's Merchant Products Chamber, the 
country 
exported 32.5 percent more wool during the period October 
1993-March 1994 than during a similar period last year. The 
country exported a total of 64,139 tonnes of wool, expressed in 
terms of dirty wool. Of this total the equivalent of 10,863 
tonnes was washed wool while 39,482 tonnes was industrialized 
wool. The main importers of dirty wool were the United Kingdom, 
the PRC, the Netherlands, Colombia, and the United States. The 
main purchasers of washed wool were Germany, Italy, the PRC, and 
the United States, and the main purchasers of industrialized 
wool were the PRC, Italy, Germany, and Hong Kong. (Montevideo EL 
PAIS 26 Apr 94 p 1) 
  There are two indicators of the good liquidity in the 
financial system at present. One is the considerable amount of 
overnight money deposited at the Central Bank on 25 
April--337.5479 million pesos, at an annual rate of 29 percent. 
The second is the great influx of money in the biddings for 
Treasury bills in pesos with a 63-day maturity, which exceeds 
100 million pesos every week. Interbank call money rates have 
also suffered the consequences of good liquidity, dropping to 31 
percent annually. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 26 Apr 94 
Market Indicators Section p 1) 
  The National Statistics Institute has reported that the 
unemployment rate in Montevideo dropped by nearly 1 percent in 
the first quarter of the year as compared with the corresponding 
period last year. It stood at 8.1 percent. This figure, however, 
does not represent a decrease in the number of people 
unemployed, but rather a decline in the working population. The 
retail sector is the most severely hit by unemployment, with 7.8 
percent, followed by industry with a 7.5 percent unemployment 
rate. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 27 Apr 94 p 
7) 
  Construction costs were up by 7.1 percent in March, thus 
registering a 9.5 percent increase so far this year. Over the 
last 12 months costs have edged up by 51.6 percent. (Montevideo 
EL PAIS in Spanish 27 Apr 94 Market Indicators Section p 1)

  [Text] Montevideo, 5 May (EFE) -- In Uruguay salary demands 
are leading to ever-increasing labor unrest, with indefinite 
strikes and the occupation of schools paralyzing public services 
and overshadowing the election campaign. 
  The third democratic Uruguayan Government to be chosen 
following the 12 years of the military regime (1973-1985) will 
be elected in this vote, which is scheduled for 29 November. 
  The conflictive situation has placed Luis Alberto Lacalle's 
government in a difficult position, due to a constitutional 
clause that prevents the party in power from using demagogic 
methods, and so does not permit salary increases for public 
employees during an election year. 
  The clause, which is traditionally respected by the 
government in power and by the labor unions, places obstacles in 
the way of any type of negotiation, and polarizes the sectors 
that are in conflict. 
  The problems originated with the settling of increases that 
had been approved last year, and their updating every four 
months based on the rate of devaluation and inflation. 
  The government has exerted strict financial control in order 
to maintain a fiscal balance, which seems to be far from what 
the public employees from some sectors, especially the judicial 
branch and the University of the Republic, expected. 
  The stoppages have increased, and the judicial branch has 
not 
functioned properly since it reopened after the yearly January 
vacation closure. 
  The employees are working "as a rule" no more than two hours 
daily, with continuous stoppages in order to participate in 
meetings. 
  A meeting has been called for today, and the employees may 
decide to call an indefinite strike "in view of the 
insensitivity of the Lacalle administration in not wishing to 
grant resources to the judicial branch to pay improved 
salaries," it was stressed. 
  In the university sector, seven colleges have been occupied 
for a week after professors, students, and officials called for 
an indefinite strike. 
  The government refuses to hand over fresh resources to the 
university, and has asked it to reduce expenditures, or at least 
make the students who can pay tuition fees, as has been 
authorized, and take deductions from wages for the days 
employees have been on strike. 
  The autonomous authorities of the university refuse to give 
up the traditional "free tuition" for higher learning. 
  The strike is also affecting Montevideo's main hospital, 
which belongs to the university, and scientific research 
institutes. 
  The conflicts have intensified as the political activities 
heat up in the search for votes in the national and municipal 
elections scheduled for November 1994. 
  The last two remaining ministers from the opposition 
Colorado 
Party left the cabinet on 5 May in order to participate in the 
election campaign: Industry Minister Eduardo Ache and Tourism 
Minister Jose Villar, who were replaced by Miguel Galeano and 
Mario Amestoy of the National Party (Blanco), which is currently 
in power. 
  Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle thanked a sector of 
the Colorado Party for its cooperation and "patriotism" in the 
government coalition, which was forged on 1 March 1990, but 
which slowly eroded after the resignations of two of the four 
opposition ministers in less than two years. 
  The opposition has begun to attack the government, accusing 
Lacalle of having started the election campaign early with tours 
in the interior of the country in an attempt to improve the 
government's image. 
  Lacalle's National Party is, for the first time in history, 
in third place in the polls, behind the Colorado Party and the 
leftist coalition Broad Front. 
  The president defends himself in stressing that his 
government has always been close to the people, and that he has 
taken on only those tasks that he promised to before becoming 
president.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace for the </F>
"Union Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] The situation recently provoked by the abrupt 
increase in the dollar's price, from 118 to 127 bolivares, 
prompted a meeting between President Rafael Caldera; Jose Bouza 
Izquierdo, chairman of the National Banking Council; and Berend 
Roosen, commissioner for financial reforms; as well as Andres 
Caldera, minister of the Presidency Secretariat, and Ciro Anez 
Fonseca, minister of agriculture and livestock. 
  The well-known banker attributed Friday's decrease in the 
rhythm of the devaluation, from 5 percent to 2.5 percent, to 
actions that were coordinated by the Central Bank of Venezuela 
and private banks. This has managed to positively control the 
dollar's exchange rate which has prevailed since last week. 
  [Begin Bouza Izquierdo recording] Nothing new or different 
is 
happening. The government has just ratified one more time that a 
foreign exchange control or a maxi-devaluation are not part of 
our current plans. I believe this is enough to believe we do not 
have to rush out and buy foreign currency with anguish, under 
pressure, or with nervousness. In fact, this only pushes the 
price upward and people who go to the parallel market will pay 
amounts that far exceed the foreign currency's real value. The 
banks are within the limitations that are characteristic of the 
operations we carry out, supplying the foreign currency that the 
Central Bank of Venezuela passes on to us. Our actions are 
within an absolutely regular scheme. I do not think we should 
feel concerned or nervous. That will only worsen the situation.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone from the "180 Minutes of News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Acting Treasury Minister Luis Javier Grisanti has 
said hasty purchases of dollars must be avoided, because the 
sale system at the Central Bank will offer greater transparency 
to the exchange market. 
  Regarding this measure, Segundo Melendez, leader of the MAS 
[Movement Toward Socialism] legislative wing, has termed the 
sale of foreign exchange as the most appropriate way to combat 
the escalation of the U.S. dollar. The MAS deputy explained the 
implementation of this exchange policy reveals the state has 
enough resources to solve the country's financial crisis. 
  Meanwhile, Henry Ramos Ayub, leader of the Democratic Action 
[AD] legislative wing, considered the sale of dollars by the 
Central Bank of Venezuela a necessary control measure, given the 
situation of collective irrationality. The AD deputy added 
exchange controls should have been established in the country 
long ago. 
  Jose Miguel Uzcategui, leader of the National Convergence, 
said the sale of dollars by the Central Bank is the most 
transparent exchange control that can be established. 
  In response to a poll conducted by Union Radio at the 
National Congress, most members of parliament agreed that the 
sale of dollars is a form of exchange control to contain the 
fears of citizens. In this regard, let us listen to Deputy Jose 
Miguel Uzcategui. 
  [Begin Uzcategui recording] All those authorized to carry 
out 
exchange transactions go to the Central Bank, which quotes a 
price, and based on that price they conduct the sale. This is 
the most transparent exchange control mechanism that exists in 
the world. It does not account for the abuses of rigid exchange 
controls that exist in Europe. These controls greatly limit the 
purchase and sale of foreign currency. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the lower 
chamber's Finance Commission, said the following. 
  [Begin Tarre Briceno recording] The first thing we must note 
is that there is no free sale of dollars. As a result, we are in 
the presence of a market subjected to some form of control. The 
sale mechanism is correct, because the demand will determine the 
value of the dollar within limited amounts offered for sale each 
day by the Central Bank. I think the closing of the market 
yesterday is more important than the dollar sale. By looking at 
how the day concluded yesterday, it appears nervousness is 
decreasing. [end recording] 
  Radical Cause Deputy Ali Rodriguez thinks the government is 
improvising. 
  [Begin Rodriguez recording] In any case, as we have stated 
systematically, we are responding to emergencies and we are not 
basing our response on a coherent strategic plan. I asked for 
the right to speak tomorrow at the Chamber of Deputies to 
discuss this crisis at the national level and its solution. [end 
recording] 
  In the meantime, AD thinks it is necessary to wait and see 
the results of this mechanism implemented by the executive 
branch.

  [Text] [words indistinct] today Thursday during student 
disturbances that took place a short distance from the 
Miraflores presidential building. 
  German Sotillo, a 16-year-old student, died after he was 
shot 
three times. According to students and professors of the Fermin 
Toro Secondary School, Sotillo was shot by a police officer who 
was riding on a water cannon that was being used to disperse the 
demonstrators. 
  The students were protesting against bus drivers who have 
been ignoring their right to preferential fares. The bus 
drivers, meanwhile, argue that since last year the government 
has failed to adequately subsidize the students' reduced fares. 
  [In a related 210-word, Caracas-datelined report, Madrid EFE 
in Spanish at 1550 GMT on 5 May quotes a police source saying, 
"the student was shot by unidentified individuals from a passing 
vehicle." Two other students also were reported to have been 
wounded by gunfire. After Sotillo was shot and killed, students 
threw rocks at police, who responded by firing tear gas grenades 
into the crowd to disperse the demonstrators.]

  [Text] Federal District Governor Asdrubal Aguiar has 
decided to retire the Metropolitan Police's Commissioners 
Command. When the governor explained the reasons that prompted 
his decision, he said the following: 
  [Begin Aguiar recording] I have adopted a decision, of which 
I have notified the Metropolitan Police Commander General, to 
retire all of the Metropolitan Police's High Command members who 
include eight general commissioners and six chief commissioners. 
  I consider this to be a sound measure for two reasons: On 
the 
one hand, it is essential to renew and revitalize the 
Metropolitan Police's actions; on the other hand, it is 
essential to allow some fresh air into its ranks. Moreover, the 
group of men who comprise the High Command, and who have 
rendered a valuable service to the Venezuelan Police and have 
exerted their best efforts in the struggle against crime, have 
been in active service for an average of 33 or 34 years. 
  I believe the time has come--and I instructed the 
Metropolitan Police commander general accordingly--for those 
eight general commissioners and six chief commissioners, a total 
of 14, to make way for the cadre of commissioners and inspectors 
who have graduated from the Metropolitan Police's University 
Institute. These men have received a refreshing education; they 
have new energy and vitality to prepare new plans and actions 
against crime in the capital of the Republic; and those who have 
rendered valuable services to the Metropolitan Police for 34, 
35, or 36 years should finally receive the retirement and rest 
they deserve. They should help us as much as possible on an 
advisory level which will enable them to cooperate in any way 
they can with the capital. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Central Bank Codirector Maria Mercedes </F>
Cuellar by Luis Alberto Lopera: "The Government Has To Tighten 
Its Belt"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Colombian economy is adjusting, as a result of 
which problems involving increased credit, inflation, and 
greater revaluation must be solved. 
  If the national government does not check public spending, 
the Colombian economy could face serious difficulties in the 
months ahead. 
  Measures adopted by the Bank of the Republic's board of 
directors guarantee that private spending will be checked 
substantially by controls placed on domestic credits and 
obstacles preventing businessmen from building up foreign debts. 
However, such measures will yield positive results only if the 
government does its part. 
  This warning comes from Maria Mercedes Cuellar de Martinez, 
codirector of the Bank of the Republic, who said that if things 
go well, the economy will return to normal performance in a 
matter of months. 
  In an interview with EL TIEMPO, the issuing institute 
official said that the restriction placed on credit is not as 
tight as it appears to be because growth in loans of slightly 
more than 30 percent a year is more than sufficient based on the 
anticipated growth of the economy. 
  She said the measures would not be revised for the UPAC 
[constant purchasing power unit] system because there has been 
some price speculation in the construction sector due to the 
fact that it does not have sufficient capacity to meet the 
demand that has emerged in recent years. 
  She also said the country cannot afford the luxury of 
maintaining an undervalued exchange rate, noting that an ideal 
devaluation would be between 12 and 13 percent rather than the 8 
percent to which it has fallen in recent weeks. 
  [Lopera] Why did credit shoot up and why did you take such a 
drastic measure to halt it? 
  [Cuellar] By mid-February, credit had quieted down and was 
growing in keeping with the anticipated parameter of 35 percent 
annually. This was an acceptable rate given last year's growth 
of over 50 percent. 
  During the last week of February and the early weeks of 
March, however, outlays of the financial system rose sharply. If 
things had continued as they were, we would have risen to a rate 
of over 60 percent or more for the year as a whole, an 
unmanageable figure. 
  That is why, following a great deal of discussion and 
analysis of what was happening, the board met and decided to 
control domestic credit and place restraints on the possibility 
of contracting debts abroad. 
  [Lopera] If businesses have gone so far into debt with 
international banks, why was credit growing so fast? Are these 
consumer loans? 
  [Cuellar] Financial credit is not only growing, but is also 
being democratized, which is very good for the economy because 
it shows that the reform of the financial sector is yielding 
results. 
  What is happening is that business has begun to redirect its 
efforts. Since the doors were opened last year for private debts 
abroad, the financial institutions had to go after other 
customers. 
  There is one very important additional fact however,. 
Businesses had previously set up chains of credit for others and 
we did not know how much interest they were collecting. 
According to reports from the Superintendency of Securities, 
enormous profits were made in this way, but the action of that 
middleman has now been curtailed. 
  [Lopera] Is it merely a problem of greater demand, or what 
is 
truly happening to the handling of the economy? 
  [Cuellar] What is happening is that the economy is adjusting 
and growth in credits is part of that adjustment. The problem is 
that while it is true that it is a very good process, the 
readjustment is happening too quickly and has generated other 
phenomena that we have to control, such as fast growth in means 
of payment (money in the hands of the public and current 
accounts). Monetary and exchange control is more difficult in an 
open economy. 
  [Lopera] What are these phenomena and how do you intend to 
attack them? 
  [Cuellar] Four problems have emerged. On the one hand, there 
is strong inflationary pressure, and the Bank of the Republic 
had to intervene with credit. That is a political and economic 
decision. Second, problems with the rate of exchange persist, 
and in the board's judgment we must protect Colombian exporters' 
ability to compete. 
  In addition, we have to begin to analyze why credit is 
growing so much: Is it because there is more income or because 
people are saving less? We now have evidence that the level of 
savings is dropping and that the financial system has more 
delinquent loans. 
  Fourth, there is excessive spending, both public and 
private. 
In the case of the former, the government is now pledging to 
postpone more spending, and temporary controls placed on credit 
will slow down growth in private spending. In order for the 
measures to function properly and be temporary, we must reduce 
spending on these two fronts. 
  [Lopera] But is that measure not very drastic and does it 
not 
cause many problems precisely at a time when the economy is 
being opened up? 
  [Cuellar] By law, monetary authorities cannot restrict 
credit 
for over 120 days (four months), but I do not think the decision 
implies any great restriction of the ministry in view of what 
the economy needs for good growth. Furthermore, borrowing abroad 
was not completely stopped, as some thought. 
  Postponing government spending is necessary because it rose 
11 percent in real terms last year. It is estimated that this 
year, there could be a nominal increase of 37 percent in the 
Central Government alone. 
  [Lopera] Finally, is the government cutting or postponing 
spending? What kind of an agreement did the minister of finance 
make with the board? 
  [Cuellar] The government could end the year with a fiscal 
surplus of 500 billion pesos, equivalent to 1 percent of the 
gross domestic product (GDP). Without counting revenue from the 
cellular telephone and privatizations, the economy could end up 
balanced. 
  An estimated 100 billion pesos of those resources would be 
obtained as a result of greater efficiency in collecting taxes, 
plus another 200 billion by cutting or postponing spending. The 
remaining 200 billion could be "saved" by certain problems 
anticipated for the months ahead. The first is the Medellin 
Metro. The second is the fact that since the Statute on 
Administrative Hiring has just been signed, the signing of a few 
contracts has been postponed. 
  [Lopera] And what if the some 369 billion pesos in 
postponements and cuts announced at the beginning of the year 
cannot be made? 
  [Cuellar] If the government does not make those cuts and 
postponements, the situation may become more complicated in the 
months ahead. Nevertheless, we must remember that it is easier 
to cut or postpone spending in the Central Government, which is 
not the case at the other two levels: the decentralized and 
local levels, which are more difficult to control. 
  [Lopera] Do you think that with the check on foreign credit, 
we can truly avoid a revaluation of the peso? How much of a 
devaluation should be made in order not to discourage exporters? 
  [Cuellar] The country cannot afford the luxury of 
maintaining 
an undervalued rate of exchange. While it is true that there is 
no problem in short-range terms, we cannot allow this to go on 
for long. The real rate of exchange is already slightly below 
100 points and the devaluation is at about 8 percent. 
  We hope that with reduced revenue in dollars and prepayments 
on the foreign debt that are being made, apart from greater 
control on the issuance of bonds in order to attract resources 
abroad, we will check the revaluation process. 
  The ideal devaluation rate would be between 12 and 13 
percent. 
  [Lopera] It is argued that money laundering has risen 
greatly. Is that already reflected in international reserves? 
  [Cuellar] I do not know where such stories start or how they 
can measure such money laundering. So far this year, 
international reserves have grown only by about $110 million. 
  [Lopera] When credit was closed, it was said that the 
measure 
was an alarm for the financial system because there are more and 
more delinquent loans. What can you tell us? 
  [Cuellar] That is true. Loans due and payable are growing at 
such an alarming rate that according to one FEDESARROLLO 
[Federation for Development] study, loans six months overdue had 
risen by 66 percent! The financial sector will have to be more 
careful in handling its portfolio in order to avoid a repeat of 
what the country went through in the early 1980's. 
  [Lopera] The construction sector and particularly the 
savings 
and housing corporations are very unhappy with the restriction 
on credit because they are the ones who will feel the effects 
the most. Do you expect to adjust the rules to facilitate their 
operations? 
  [Cuellar] What is happening in the construction sector is 
that it has been unable to meet the high demand. They do not 
have sufficient, which is generating some price speculation. 
Housing construction costs are among those that have risen the 
most since last year because neither the cementworks nor the 
brickyards are providing an adequate supply, and the producers 
of other types of goods are in the same situation. 
  If they cannot meet demand, they can perfectly well sell 
less 
without putting upward pressure on prices for such goods.

<F P=106> [Letter submitted to CAMBIO 16 by Gilberto and Miguel </F>
Rodriguez Orejuela] 
  [Text] Because of the media's attitude toward us, an 
attitude motivated by a need to create a stronger impact and 
sensation with the news, as citing specific names certainly 
draws a wider audience and increased circulation, this arbitrary 
and constant persecution and the sacrifice of our constitutional 
rights by people who would rather make news than present the 
news is becoming intolerable to us. We are, therefore, making 
the following remarks. 
  1. The dissemination of this large amount of news, most 
often 
at odds with reality, persistently ignores our constitutional 
rights contained in Articles 15, 20, 21, and 29 of the National 
Constitution. We have not waived those rights, and we will 
defend ourselves by using the instruments provided by law. 
  2. The essence of a democratic state of law is based on the 
fundamental rights of the individual. These pillars of democracy 
cannot be resigned or renounced. One such right is the right to 
information contained in Article 20 of the Constitution in its 
two major aspects: the right to inform and the right to be 
informed. We respect this important and universal principle, and 
we defend its historic and political raison d'etre. 
There can be no doubt that we have always greatly respected, as 
we shall continue to do, the oral, written, and television 
media, because of the convictions imparted to us by our academic 
and political background. 
  3. A free press, so cherished by democracy, must act 
responsibly (Article 20, second paragraph of the Constitution). 
The parameters of this responsibility are described in the 
Constitution. The right to information loses primacy when it 
clashes with individual rights; therefore, it must be exercised 
truthfully and impartially (Article 20, first paragraph) so 
these rights will not be damaged. 
  4. Most recently, all news reports on the antidrug campaign 
and the seizure of prohibited substances that create physical or 
psychological dependency have been accompanied by three 
references that have become a standard and mandatory feature: 
  4a. Ownership of the cargo seized, no matter where these 
substances were found in Colombia or elsewhere, is attributed to 
the "Cali Cartel." 
  4b. It is stated that the Cali Cartel is an organization 
created and run by the undersigned. 
  4c. The article is illustrated with photos of the 
undersigned, depending on the desired magnitude of the impact. 
  We dispute all of the above: there is no proof to support 
the 
constant linkage of our names with the criminal deeds reported 
in the news. Even worse, it can be corroborated by the news 
accounts themselves that the reported events have no connection 
to us, and our names, photos, and images were used improperly 
only to give color, illustrate, and capture the attention of the 
listener, reader, or viewer. 
  5. Neither of the undersigned has ever been convicted in 
Colombia or in any other country of the crime of drug 
trafficking. We have borne the legal proceedings against us both 
here and abroad with dignity, decorum, and respect for justice. 
  6. According to our Constitution, those who bear great 
responsibility to ensure the community's respect for the 
Constitution, that is, the National Government, particularly the 
Office of the Prosecutor General and the Office of the Attorney 
General, and what is known as the fourth estate (the media), 
must perform their duties and uphold the principle of the 
citizens' equality before the law (Article 13 of the 
Constitution). Therefore, it is clear that the guarantee of the 
presumption of innocence contained in Article 29 of the 
Constitution protects us, and no one can incriminate us, 
especially publicly. This is illegal when no charges have been 
proven against us in any court, nor has our guilt been 
established by a definitive court ruling (Article 29 of the 
Constitution and Article 2 of the Criminal Procedures Code), the 
only judgment that a state of law accepts. Otherwise, we may at 
some time take legal action. 
  Because of our respect for the law, when any of the media 
has 
proof of criminal activity on our part, including a definitive 
conviction, we will not oppose publication of that information 
with whatever publicity the media consider appropriate. But 
until that happens, we demand that our constitutional rights be 
respected and observed, by virtue of our status as Colombian 
citizens. 
  [Signed] Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, Miguel Rodriguez 
Orejuela, Cali

<F P=106> [Excerpts of interview with President Fidel Castro by </F>
Caribbean Braodcasting Union reporter Sharon Marshall, in 
Barbados, date not given, passages within quotation marks 
recorded] 
  [Text] During the interview granted to the Caribbean 
Broadcasting Union, Fidel discussed the results of the Small 
Island Nations Summit. 
  [Castro, in Spanish with simultaneous translation into 
English] "I believe this summit is a continuation of the Rio 
Summit. The Rio Summit was extremely important since it helped 
to build an awareness about environmental issues. Politicians 
are not usually very well informed about these matters. I 
believe that in Rio, for the first time, they faced up to the 
tragedy that environmental degradation means for the world. At 
that time, they were undergoing a learning process. 
  ``At this conference, I noticed an increased awareness among 
politicians, and more awareness among industrialized nations, 
more than in Rio, and within a short period of time. Since Rio, 
politicians from island states have of course been more aware 
than anyone else. I recall that members of our delegation had 
had contact with representatives from these countries, and they 
were truly distressed by future prospects.'' 
  Fidel also made reference to the historic victory of the 
South African people in the recent elections that brought an end 
to apartheid. 
  [Castro] "The work that took place helped preserve the 
independence of Angola, reaffirmed the independence of Namibia, 
and accelerated the disappearance of apartheid. I think it 
helped accelerate the process. Namibia, in any case, would have 
become independent sooner or later. Sooner or later, apartheid 
would have disappeared because apartheid was intolerable in 
today's world. The South African people, like the people of 
Namibia, fought hard and long, made many sacrifices, and 
attained their goals. I believe they had great leaders. They are 
a great, extremely courageous, hard fighting, energetic, 
intelligent, capable people. They have reached this point. 
  ``We have to study the period from after the end of the war, 
the period of the elections, and the extraordinary role played 
by Mandela -- his leadership talent, his wisdom. He was an 
unifying force, overcame every obstacle, and remained firm. He 
was flexible in achieving this political miracle, these 
elections in which everyone participated and which achieved such 
a resounding victory. It was a great victory for the people of 
South Africa, a great victory for Africa, for the world, and for 
the liberal movement. I believe we all now need to contribute to 
support harmony and peace.'' 
  Fidel reiterated the conditions necessary for the 
normalization of ties between Cuba and the United States. 
  [Castro] "First of all, for the blockade to end. It is an 
unfair, harsh, cruel blockade, which includes medicines and 
foodstuffs. It was imposed on Cuba 35 years ago. It is one of 
the longest blockades in history, and the most unjustified of 
all. 
  ``Second, for the United States to resign itself to the fact 
that Cuba is an independent, sovereign country. Third, respect 
for our people's right to choose the political, social, and 
economic system they believe most fair. These are the three 
essential factors. We do not have anything against the United 
States. We have not blockaded the United States. We do not want 
to change the U.S. social system; we do not seek to establish 
socialism in the United States. This, in any case, would be as 
complicated as establishing capitalism in Russia. They are 
similar things, given the characteristics of these countries. We 
are therefore not trying to rule the United States, nor diminish 
its independence one iota. It is not that we have a problem with 
the United States. It is the United States that has a problem 
with us.''

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with President Fidel Castro by </F>
station reporter Gisela Veleredia in Georgetown; date not given 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] In what was considered the most important aspect of 
the Cuban delegation's visit to Barbados, President Fidel Castro 
placed a wreath at the very place where a Barbados airliner [as 
heard] crashed in 1976. Several members of the Cuban fencing 
team died in the accident, along with other Caribbean citizens. 
The commander in chief, visibly moved, said he had thought 
about this moment from the time he decided to travel to 
Barbados. He also gave us his opinion on the decisions made at 
the First World Conference on Sustainable Development of Small 
Island States. 
  [Begin recording] [Veleredia] What do the expressions of 
solidarity you received from the Caribbean leaders at this 
conference mean for Cuba? 
  [Castro] Such expressions of solidarity and friendship have 
always been extremely important to us as this [words indistinct]. 
  [Veleredia] Did you think of this moment when you decided to 
come to Barbados? 
  [Castro] Yes, it was the first thing I thought about. 
  [Veleredia] Do you think that every Cuban who travels to 
Barbados thinks of the events that took place here? 
  [Castro] What is this place called? It is not very far from 
where the tragedy occurred. 
  [Veleredia] [Words indistinct] opportunity? 
  [Castro] There always is and there always will be. 
  [Veleredia] Could you comment on the other activities of the 
day in this first visit to Barbados? 
  [Castro] I have been able to do several things. I met with 
the media and had several other individual meetings. Later 
today I will visit the governor, who is the [word indistinct] 
and the minister of justice. 
  [Veleredia] [Words indistinct] 
  [Castro] They were very friendly toward Cuba. I expect to 
see a few other things and meet some of the country's leaders of 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Veleredia] Are you pleased with this first visit to an 
English-speaking Caribbean nation? 
  [Castro] Very pleased, but I have not really had a chance to 
get to know the people. I have only seen the streets and 
buildings. The people here are very warm and welcoming and very 
polite. I have been very impressed. 
  [Unidentified reporter] After meeting with the people of 
this 
island, do you still maintain that Cuba came to this forum with 
a broad based political commitment? 
  [Castro] Or course. You cannot come to this meeting or this 
country with any other idea. Contacts with these island nations 
were initiated in Rio de Janeiro. I felt the enormous concern 
these nations have about the changing climate and the rising 
waters. They are experiencing a dramatic situation. This is a 
matter of life or death to them. Any natural phenomenon would 
have the same effect on any country, but it has a greater 
importance for these people. 
  [Reporter] Even when many developed nations [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Castro] They have been absent, but I perceive a greater 
degree of awareness about these problems than there was in Rio 
de Janeiro. 
  [Veleredia] Do you think this meeting and your visit will 
pave the way for closer relations? 
  [Castro] The road is already being paved. Anything that 
works in that direction will contribute to closer ties. It is 
very important to talk with the leaders and learn what they are 
thinking. You know I did not miss a minute of the conference. 
[Words indistinct] I congratulate you because you were there 
all the time. 
  [Veleredia] The prime minister of Barbados said he would 
work to solve the differences that prevent Cuba from becoming 
part of the Organization of Caribbean States. What are the 
major differences? 
  [Castro] There are no differences between us. 
  [Veleredia] I meant the obstacles to Cuban integration. 
  [Castro] The ones that already exist and are known. [end 
recording] 
  The commander in chief defied the ridges and climbed down to 
the beach to allow the (?waves) to touch his feet, thus honoring 
the martyrs who died in Barbados. Today the commander was to 
continue his agenda here in Barbados, which includes a visit 
with Governor Nita Barrow.

  [Text] On 6 May at the first Global Conference on 
Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, 
President Fidel Castro said nongovernment organizations [NGO's] 
have become a very powerful force in international policy. 
  In an informal meeting with NGO representatives from the 
Caribbean, Pacific, Mediterranean, and Atlantic regions at the 
(Sherbon Center) in Bridgetown, Fidel Castro said these 
organizations are fully aware of policies concerning 
environmental and other matters. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, (Jean Franz), coordinator 
of 
such Caribbean organizations, recalled the support expressed for 
Cuba in the recently concluded forum of those organizations. A 
resolution was approved defending the Cuban people's right to 
choose its own model for alternative development and condemning 
the U.S. Administration for the economic and financial blockade 
against Cuba. 
  Fidel Castro expresssed thanks for the expressions of 
support 
and solidarity and added: We must change the negative 
environment the United States has created around Cuba with the 
blockade which prompts serious problems in the supply of 
foodstuff, medicines, and many other products essential to our 
development. 
  Fidel Castro received lengthy applause from the people when 
he said: We feel like friends, like brethren among you, and for 
this reason I am leaving this country and this conference with a 
feeling of joy. 
  Among other subjects discussed during the informal meeting, 
the Cuban leader joked about speculations on the state of his 
health which appeared in the local press and about which he was 
asked several times by reporters from a Miami television station 
who traveled to Bridgetown on learning of the Cuban statesman's 
presence in that capital. 
  You are continuously asking me about the state of my health, 
and whether I sat down before and after the speech at the 
plenary session. In fact, I can no longer do the many things I 
used to do in Sierra Maestra days, but I still walk a great deal 
and swim for several hours, Castro said. 
  In his final remarks, Fidel Castro underscored the 
importance 
of that meeting in organizing an action strategy to defend the 
islands from the serious problems that are threatening them, 
such as pollution, radioactive wastes, and climatic changes.

  [Text] Despite apparent positive signs, the bilateral 
relations between China and the United States today seem more 
clouded than ever. Diplomatic circles in Beijing said that they 
had evidently reached another crossroad in their relations, 
pointing out that the PRC lodged a strong protest to the United 
State's adoption of a congressional ruling that contains 
stipulations against China. According to reports, legislation of 
foreign relations for 1994 and 1995 assumes a position toward 
Taiwan and Tibet different from those included in the 
communiques signed by Beijing and Washington to regulate 
diplomatic relations. 
  Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei pointed out that 
the ruling was a deliberate attempt to frustrate reunification 
and that it goes against the commitment of recognizing only one 
China, which includes Taiwan.

<F P=106> [Speech by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban </F>
Workers Federation, during the morning session of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government in Havana, ANPP, on 1 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Comrade Alarcon, I would now like to present to the 
assembly a report on the results of the workers parliaments for 
consideration during this session's debates. 
  We meet here today to summarize the meaning and possible 
development of a democratic process capable of earning the 
prestige of being useful and of establishing itself as a 
feasible method for popular participation in the solution to our 
economic problems. 
  Above all, we face a promising, encouraging path that 
categorically confirms that the economic solutions demanded by 
pressing reality must be identified by the people as their own, 
based on the greatest possible consensus and in such a way that 
their reasons are understood, so that the gates can open for 
collective action on an efficient economy that ensures the 
preservation and development of our socialist society. 
  In looking at the results of the assembly process, the 
Parliaments in the Workplaces, which had the participation of 
approximately 3 million workers throughout the country who 
debated the economic problems of each center and added to the 
arsenal of ideas that could be activated to restructure internal 
finances, we express our profound joy that the workers 
throughout the entire nation, in all work centers, in the 
immense majority of their proposals demonstrated patriotism, 
honor, and the will to do whatever is required to save the 
Revolution, just as Fidel requested during his intervention in 
the last special session of the ANPP. 
  The labor union movement can take credit for having 
organized 
the workers parliaments, for having interpreted Fidel's thoughts 
and the conclusions of the fourth plenum of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] regarding the 
importance of avoiding a technocratic focus in the solutions, 
beginning from the point that without the understanding and will 
of the workers and the people, no problems can be solved and no 
measures can do any good. 
  In the short time between December and today, we prepared 
our 
cadres, we summoned the workers to hold the parliaments, and we 
held meetings with more than 80,000 labor union sectors, which 
had the support of the party and government, as well as the 
active participation of our deputies and the presidency of the 
ANPP. 
  We believe that the administration of the work centers, 
noticeably advancing with regard to their prior experience, 
decisively supported this process and became worthy of the 
workers' recognition, most of whom appreciated the quality of 
the report to the assembly and their cooperation, for a frank 
and realistic discussion on the problems of each center. 
  For 45 days, the country became an immense school on 
economics and politics, in which much was learned and during 
which it was realized that much remains to be learned, 
investigated, and renovated in the specific economic sphere of 
each work center. 
  The press has played a distinctive role, contributing with 
convincing arguments and with real reflection in the debates to 
enrich and stimulate the participation of the workers, who in 
this process came to a greater understanding of the complex 
situation we face and of the need to continue taking measures 
with the greatest care, without anxious haste, focusing on 
reactivating the economy, producing more and better with 
available resources under conditions of the blockade and special 
period. 
  Comrades, the work has just begun. Let us take heart in the 
fact that the workers considered these parliaments worthwhile. 
Above all, let us think of the long road ahead of us in all 
senses. An analysis of the innumerable suggestions made by the 
workers is not a one-day task. Today, we should confine 
ourselves to synthesis of the people's thought, which is 
essentially connected in economic terms with a more profound 
political and ideological culture, but which does not achieve 
the desired correspondence. 
  Let us make way for this synthesis and let us remember that 
the assemblies included points that reconfirm the wisdom of the 
collective intelligence and the provisions of immutable loyalty 
toward the Revolution and socialism, as well as indications of 
confusion; reminiscences of an economic mentality that should 
develop even further; and, in some respects, ideas that have 
nothing to do with today's efficiency reality. 
  The debates in the workers parliaments expressed a great 
coincidence that the enterprises should reach profitability 
based on efficient work and the proper use of materials and 
financial resources, without elevating prices, and placing 
emphasis on the reduction of costs. 
  In a great many meetings, the companies have been urged to 
seek and find alternative formulas to increase their income by 
means of a secondary, or side, production which, without 
detriment to the principal production, will result in greater 
exploitation of material and human resources. 
  The workers have underscored in many meetings the need to 
reduce subsidies to companies to the point of eliminating all 
but those that can be fully justified. 
  Another matter that was thoroughly analyzed in the meetings 
was cost reduction. At the same time, measures have been 
outlined so that workers will be able to participate in the 
analysis and control of expenditures, and so that this control 
will be resolutely carried out in those places where the 
expenditures are incurred but not the way it is done now, and 
that this situation be handled by exclusive areas that 
centralize the information and analyses. 
  We must note that in many places, the workers have learned 
that their respective companies have not been profitable. They 
have realized the amount of losses and consequent subsidies. So 
they voiced their complaints that positive actions must be taken 
concerning costs and expenditures of both the budgeted units and 
those conceived to attain revenues and profit. 
  Workers everywhere also noted the need for administrations 
in 
the future to provide systematic information on these aspects, 
to the workers, with the purpose of encouraging the struggle for 
efficiency and to facilitate the economic analyses in each unit. 
  One of the most often repeated proposals was that of 
improving human services in all centers. Likewise, there is an 
overwhelming consensus concerning the need to increase the 
control of state assets, with the dual purpose of reducing 
production costs and preventing the main sources from going to 
the black market and to criminal acts. 
  The workers have repeatedly called for improvement of the 
labor law in an effort to eliminate its paternalistic content 
and to adjust it to the needs of production and labor efficiency. 
  The subject of labor and technological and administrative 
discipline was discussed in several meetings and from differing 
points of view. The workers especially referred to the lack of 
administrative exigency and to the pernicious effect of the 
current system of medical certificates and reports. 
  In many thousands of meetings, the workers stressed the idea 
that an efficient increase in production and services is the 
essential way to stabilize internal finances and to achieve an 
adequate provision to the people. 
  The delicate and complex problem of the reorganization of 
personnel rosters and reinstatement of personnel was broadly 
debated. There was an overwhelming consensus on the need to 
adopt measures to improve worker productivity, to reduce costs, 
and to efficiently organize production. 
  In many places where there is an obvious excess labor force, 
the workers themselves, whose posts can be the object of 
rationalization, have called for the initiation of this process, 
confident that in the Revolution, they will find just solutions 
and that no one will be neglected; and that people will always 
work for the development of economically justifiable job 
opportunities. 
<H5>  Streamlining Internal Finances </H5>
  The issue of streamlining internal finances has gained major 
impetus in the discussions in the workplace parliaments, to the 
extent that these discussions developed. 
  The proposals to charge for services that are currently 
free, 
to change prices, to impose new taxes, and others, unlike the 
subjects related to economic efficiency, have prompted various 
reactions. However, it has been verified that the development of 
the debates has contributed to clarification and consolidation 
of the inevitable need to adopt effective measures to streamline 
internal finances. 
  One fact has been confirmed by this process throughout the 
country. It has to do with the overwhelming consensus among 
Cuban workers that education and health care in our society must 
remain free of charge, arguing that these are achievements of 
the Revolution and must be maintained. 
  However, in many places, the workers proposed charging for 
cosmetic surgery and similar services. Some have even proposed 
charging for dental care services. Others have proposed charging 
those responsible for traffic accidents and physical 
aggressions, feeling that they should pay for the medical 
assistance given to their victims. 
  Others have reaffirmed the proposal to pay for basic school 
supplies and uniforms, although others proposed the payment only 
in case of losses. To a lesser extent, workers proposed 
distribution of expendable material free of charge the first 
time, but selling it at accessible prices afterwards throughout 
the year. 
  Some parliaments proposed charging for school supplies at 
high school and university levels, while other parliaments 
proposed charging in accordance with the income of the student's 
family. Some parliaments proposed charging for university and 
postgraduate studies in languages and others are not considered 
basic education. Other parliaments proposed charging when the 
student abandons his studies, or when as a graduate he does not 
work in the field he studied. 
  Another proposal was that of charging at the semiboarding 
schools as in the case of childcare centers, as well as other 
free services in the education area, especially when there is a 
change in career or in lodging, and also for the food the 
students eat in boarding schools. 
  The workers also made repeated analyses of the possibility 
of 
charging for services which are not considered essential in 
other aspects of the country's life. In several meetings the 
workers underscored the idea that the state must consider 
maintaining some free services that are suitable; in other 
meetings, but in a lesser extent, the workers considered the 
possibility of eliminating all free services. 
  Among the free services not considered essential, to which 
the workers referred in the meetings, in addition to those 
already discussed and which have to do with health and 
education, are the following: charging for civil registery 
office services and for some spraying services; eliminating free 
delivery of products and foods to workers in certain places; 
increasing taxes on vehicles; charging modest prices for 
personal protection means, public bathrooms, and some funeral 
services; charging drug stores for the distribution of vitamins; 
charging cyclists for use of roads; charging tolls in tunnels, 
on highways, etc. 
  In several meetings the workers proposed charging for 
cultural activities, excepting entrance fees for children. In 
some parliaments the workers proposed charging tickets at indoor 
events and with professional artists. Workers also repeated the 
proposal to charge modest prices for sports events. Very few 
proposed not charging for these events. 
  Many parliaments also agreed on the need to charge for 
recreational activities. Workers proposed the need to increase 
these activities, especially for children and youth, proposing 
in some cases turning movie theaters into video arcades because 
the movie theaters are not being used. 
  The workers parliaments have also analyzed the use of prices 
to reduce excess currency in circulation. They proposed the 
direct sale to workers of products coming from the worker 
centers, charging for services such as state transport, 
including those with red license plates. The workers also 
proposed the use of vehicles from the different organizations to 
collect the money, incentivizing the driver with a percentage of 
revenues. 
  In general, there was consensus concerning the idea of not 
increasing transport tariffs, although some parliaments have 
proposed this. Among the proposals made we can mention that of 
increasing the prices of gasoline, lubricants, and accessories. 
  In many meetings the workers proposed eliminating alcoholic 
beverages, cigarettes, and tobacco in general from the ration 
book, selling them freely but increasing their prices. However, 
some meetings were against the increase in prices, or at least 
they proposed a moderate increase. Some also proposed keeping 
them in the ration book. 
  In other meetings the workers proposed maintaining the 
established cigarette quota but eliminating the additional quota 
and imposing a fixed price for those that are sold freely. Among 
the analyzed aspects we can also mention the alternative to 
encourage the formation of accounts for workers' and peasants' 
funds. The People's Savings Bank has also been urged to pay 
higher interest rates so as to foment savings. 
  Concerning prices in the foods area, the workers have 
proposed a revision, saying that prices must be in line with 
quality. There were also proposals saying that prices of some 
services are too high and that not all workers have access to 
those services. 
  Concerning the price of food in the workers' cafeterias, the 
workers also proposed a revision in order to adjust them in 
accordance with reasonable costs and the quality of the food, 
although many parliaments were against a readjustment of prices. 
  There were repeated proposals to charge for water, 
especially 
imposing a higher price on those who waste water. But there were 
many more proposals to raise electricity rates, especially for 
excessive use above a given quota. 
  Workers also agreed on an increase in telephone rates 
provided that service is also improved. There were fewer 
proposals not to charge for water or to increase the electricity 
rate. 
  There was an overwhelming consensus against the imposition 
of tax on salaries, although some parliaments were also in favor 
of a tax on salaries. 
  On several occasions the workers proposed the idea of 
subsidizing low-income families to protect them from price 
readjustments. 
  In many parliaments there were proposals to take into 
consideration the income of self-employed workers at the time of 
implementing the new tax. Other parliaments have directly 
proposed that high taxes be imposed on the income of 
self-employed workers. Some also proposed charging a tax on 
peasants in accordance with their income. 
  The complex [passage indistinct] in the workers parliaments 
where there were many proposals to implement them. Fewer 
proposals were against implementing them, arguing that the 
country is not prepared for this and that it would not resolve 
the financial problem. 
  There was almost absolute consensus in the discussions on 
the 
confiscation of the money and other resources of doubtful origin 
from all those who have accrued wealth illegally. 
  During the discussions the workers in different parliaments 
proposed the revision and amendment of the penal code, while 
others proposed the implementation of stronger punishments on 
those citizens who commit crimes, especially economic crimes. 
  We understand that the first duty of the union movement is 
to 
urge the workers to strengthen their fighting morale, to prevent 
them from becoming discouraged, to strengthen their confidence 
that we will be successful, and to assure that whatever we do 
will preserve socialism and its essential achievements. We must 
continue developing our awareness and spirit to understand the 
sacrifice that is implicit in these measures, which are 
inevitable to save what is essential. 
  Likewise, we must meditate on the great lines of action 
awaiting the unions. The Parliaments in the Workplace have 
demonstrated their validity as a method of rapport on the 
situation that is in the interest of the workers and 
administrative leaders for the study of basic problems and the 
collective quest for solutions, starting from the individual 
contribution and united with the administrations, the union 
organizations, and the political leadership. We must learn 
lessons from all this: the need to be more communicative and to 
maintain a continuous presence in the centers, to teach and 
learn, to learn how to establish a closer relationship with our 
union members, to convey the experience of how to solve the 
problems that are worrying the workers, to interpret them and 
help them find a solution. 
  Changing what has been achieved in the workers parliaments 
into a permanent style and method of union work implies, above 
all, the revitalization and perfection of the role of the unions 
which must use the authority bestowed upon them as 
representatives of the true owners of the means of production, 
and thereby to wage an ideological war against any way of 
thinking that could obstruct the country's development and the 
path to efficiency. To say it in another way: We must tirelessly 
fight against anything that affects the workers' interests, be 
it labor or technological indiscipline, lack of control, or the 
bureacratic web which delays the solutions of problems; favors 
apathy, idleness, irresponsibility; and does not concern itself 
when resources are lost or are insufficiently exploited. 
  The battle for economic efficiency is not just a temporary 
slogan under the difficult Cuban economic situation, but the 
central aspect for which the unions and our CTC must work. 
  In compliance with the workers' demands in several centers 
throughout the country, the CTC National Secretariat has decided 
to give a new profile to the Assemblies of Production and 
Service, replacing them by the Assemblies for Economic 
Efficiency which will pay special attention to these decisive 
objectives of our work. This objective is giving new life to the 
spirit of the workers parliaments in each task or union activity 
in which we might be engaged; that frank, critical, and 
self-critical analysis must prevail everywhere, seeking not 
justification where there is none but solutions that can be 
implemented with the presence and active participation of all 
those interested. 
  After verifying once again the workers' indestructible 
loyalty to the Revolution, and after verifying in dozens of 
thousands of meetings that the Cuban workers, above the current 
sacrifices and deprivations, are willing to fight with all their 
might to maintain the integrity of the fatherland and the 
achievements of socialism, we cannot but strengthen our 
commitment to Fidel and to the people, that the Cuban union 
movement will be, today and always, a bulwark of the 
revolutionary spirit, a tireless and tenacious force of the 
resistance and of the victory our people deserve. 
  Fatherland or death, socialism or death, we will win. 
[applause] 
  This has been our report, comrade president.

  [Text] Politburo members Carlos Lage, Jose Ramon Machado 
Ventura, and Ricardo Alarcon chaired a recent meeting with 
presidents of Administrative Councils where they analyzed the 
budget, self-employment, the local industry, and the illegal 
sale of vehicles and homes. 
  With regard to the national budget, it was determined that 
it 
has presented positive signs during the first two months of the 
year. Holguin was the only province to register an improvement 
in its own income. 
  The analysis on self-employment established that some 
craftsmen employ other people in their production, using energy 
and raw material of doubtful origin. It was also mentioned that 
in many cases it is not a craft activity, but rather an 
industrial activity. With the purpose of detecting any 
undercover illegality, the participants at the meeting agreed to 
review all licenses granted those calling themselves craftsmen. 
  Another important point of the discussion was the sale of 
vehicles received as incentives and the illegal buying and 
selling of homes. The analysis determined that intellectuals, 
laborers, cadres, and public officials have been involved in 
buying and selling cars and motorcycles. It was recalled that 
the state has a legal and moral right to appropriate these goods 
because their owners signed and accepted a contract stipulating 
that the state has preference over the vehicle when the owner no 
longer has use for it. 
  Regarding houses, its was also pointed out that the existing 
law, which states that the right to own real estate must not 
become a mechanism of gain or exploitation, is being violated. 
It was explained that rigorous action will be taken in the event 
of these illegal acts and that sanctions will be extended 
indefinitely and constantly reviewed to prevent future 
occurrences.

  [Text] On 5 May, GRANMA carries an article by Susana Lee 
regarding issues debated at a meeting of presidents of the 
provincial Administrative Councils and the Isle of Youth 
convened by the secretariat of the Council of Ministers. The 
issues discussed were the national budget, self-employment, 
local industries, and illegal sales of vehicles and houses. 
  It was announced that the budget showed generally positive 
signs in the first months and that if this were to continue, the 
deficit could diminish by 1 billion pesos in 1994 in relation to 
last year. 
  Regarding self-employment, it was decided to review all the 
licenses issued to artisans in order to detect any irregularity 
and act accordingly; to suspend licenses issued to artisans in 
plastic, and give these workers the option of rejoining local 
industries; and to leave in the hands of the Administrative 
Councils the option of extending or issuing the licenses deemed 
necessary. 
  The report on local industries showed that the drop in 
production this year is basically due to the reallocation of 
supplies to sectors with a higher popular demand, the fact that 
most local industry plastic product workers shifted to the 
self-employed sector, and a drop in basic resources. 
  An important discussion was held on measures implemented to 
confront the illegal sale and purchase of homes, as well as 
violations in the sale of vehicles given as incentives by owners 
who then disregard the state's first purchase option to buy 
them. The state has the legal and moral right to seize these 
goods given the fact that their owners, at the time of purchase, 
accepted a contract establishing the state's first purchase 
option for vehicles when the owner no longer wanted them. 
Regarding houses, on the basis of principles established in 
current law, under no circumstances can the personal house 
ownership right become a tool for profiting or exploitation. 
  It was stressed at the meeting that the law will be 
implemented vigorously and permanently and will continue to be 
modified to avoid recurrence in the future. 
  Politburo members Carlos Lage, Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, 
and Ricardo Alarcon chaired the meeting which included the 
participation of numerous ministers, other Communist Party of 
Cuba officials, cadres, and state and administration officials 
involved with the diverse issues discussed. 
  [Radio Rebelde at 1948 GMT on 5 May adds that Finance and 
Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez also participated in the 
meeting.]

  [Text] [Passage indistinct] President Aristide was ousted 
in a military coup in September 1991 and has been living in the 
United States ever since. [Words indistinct] an embargo against 
the Haitian authorities has failed to do little than hurt the 
people of Haiti, and they are fleeing their native country, 
flocking to the United States and The Bahamas. In fact, at this 
moment a session of the high-level segment of the UN global 
conference, Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham spoke of 
this influx of refugees, saying it is a burden for his country. 
  [Begin Ingraham recording] The Bahamas could be faced with 
large numbers of illegal Haitian immigrants who continue to pour 
into our country, creating excessive demands on our educational, 
housing, health, and welfare services, creating unregulated 
pressures on natural resources, including water, demands which 
we can ill-afford to meet. How can a nation of 280,000 people 
reasonably be expected to cope with the problems of millions of 
Haitians? Ill-equipped though we are to meet these demands on 
resources, The Bahamas is humane in its treatment of Haitian and 
Cuban shipwrecked persons. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan, while not an 
advocate of military intervention, believes there is no other 
solution to the Haitian crisis: 
  [Begin Jagan recording] I know what military occupation from 
imperialist powers has done to a lot of countries, but we have 
to look at the dialectics of the whole situation. First, 
Aristide was overwhelmingly elected by the people. Second, if he 
is not restored to power, it sends a wrong message to would-be 
dictators and military upstarts in different parts of the world 
because there is a movement throughout the world toward 
democratization and this can be endangered if Aristide is not 
returned to power. [end recording] 
  President Clinton has [word indistinct] the support of Ricky 
Singh, president of the Caribbean Association of Media Workers, 
a nongovernmental organization accredited to the conference. Mr. 
Singh says the U.S. threat can be avoided, but he pointed out 
that (the other way), Caribbean people, and especially 
journalists, have a moral obligation to [word indistinct] the 
Haitian people. 
  [Begin Singh recording] [Word indistinct] have to begin to 
interact with Haitian counterparts in terms of promoting a 
better understanding among the Haitian and the people of the 
rest of the Caribbean. There is a lot of ignorance abroad and a 
lot of prejudices among non-Haitian Caribbean people because we 
have [word indistinct] over the years all of the ugly 
caricatures of the Haitian masses. It is our problem that [word 
indistinct] ourselves from that process and beginning to relate 
more pragmatically and sensibly to the problems facing the 
Haitian masses. [end recording] 
  So it is now a question of wait and see, to see if the U .S. 
will indeed send its troops to Haiti and what will be the 
outcome.

  [Text] Jean-Bertrand Aristide solicits the renewal of the 
mandate of the civilian mission in Haiti. In a letter addressed 
to the UN secretary general, the Haitian president-in-exile 
asked for the renewal of the mandate of the International 
Civilian Mission in Haiti, according to the terms of reference 
already negotiated with Dante Caputo. 
  Referring to a deterioration of human rights and democracy 
in 
Haiti, Aristide hoped that the presence of the mission is 
contributing to an improvement in the human rights situation and 
helping create a favorable environment for political dialogue in 
the country.

  [Text] MNP-28 [National Patriotic Movement of 28 November], 
led by Dejean Belizaire, reacted to the threats of military 
intervention in Haiti and the total embargo planned against 
Haiti. Belizaire accuses the U.S. President of violating the 
national sovereignty of the Republic of Haiti. The former 
president of the National Assembly condemns the behavior of the 
international community, which is trying, he says, to impose a 
solution from the outside to a crisis that is above all, 
Haitian. It is up to Haitians to solve the problems of power and 
of the political regime in Haiti, stated Belizaire on this new 
twist in the political crisis: 
  [Begin Belizaire recording] Haiti is an independent, 
sovereign state, bound through mutual respect to cooperate with 
the other states in the hemisphere and with the international 
institutions. But it is up to Haitians and to Haitians alone to 
solve the problems of power and political regimes in this 
country. It is desirable under the exceptional circumstances of 
this crisis, however, that the opposing parties understand that 
in their search for a durable solution, they must be open to 
mutual concessions or to pay an unavoidable price. 
  Second, the institution of democracy in Haiti, as is the 
case 
for all countries in the hemisphere, will be the product of the 
economic, political, and social contradiction game, and of a 
long process. But it cannot in any way be imposed from the 
outside. The 19 years of U.S. military occupation, beginning in 
1915, only broke the dynamic struggle of the Haitian people for 
change, and interrupted the country's process of democratization. 
  Third, a total and complete embargo and military invasion as 
a means of solving the Haitian crisis is a monumental, gross 
mistake from which the international community must immediately 
dissociate in order to safeguard its distinguished image and the 
future of its relations with the Haitian people and with the 
authentic political parties, the only ones that are permanent, 
durable, and unfailingly attached to the fate of the sovereign 
Republic of Haiti. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The National Reconstruction Movement [MRN] of 
Rene Theodore has demanded the resignation of General Raoul 
Cedras as a way out of the deadlock. MRN leader Rene Theodore, 
former prospective prime minister, explained in a statement on 
Signal FM that the departure of Gen. Raoul Cedras is necessary 
to avoid a military intervention in Port-au-Prince: 
  [Begin Theodore recording] "Instead of speaking of military 
intervention, since the Haitian military institution is not 
hostile toward anyone, the foreign powers should carry out their 
commitment to bring military cooperation to Haiti to help 
discipline the Haitian Army, professionalize the officers and 
noncommissioned officers of the Haitian Army, and establish the 
police force provided for by the Haitian Constitution. They 
signed documents to this effect and they must fulfill their 
obligation." [end recording] 
  Theodore also calls on the sectors involved in the crisis to 
work toward a respect for legality and legitimacy. MRN demands 
the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to avoid the 
reinforcement of sanctions against the country. Theodore reminds 
parliamentarians of the difficult crossroads the country is 
facing: 
  [Begin Theodore recording] "[Passage omitted] It is very 
clear to everyone that the resolution of the crisis will begin 
with the resignation of Gen. Cedras. MRN demands the resignation 
of Gen. Cedras as the first step toward cancellation of the 
international community's actions and claims." [end recording] 
  This was Rene Theodore who has ended his silence, his long 
silence, to take a stand in favor of the return of President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

  [Excerpts] Rumors indicating that right-wing political 
leaders are ready to install a new government, challenging the 
United Nations and U.S. President Bill Clinton, are circulating 
in the Haitian capital. The British news agency, Reuters, 
reports that Haitian businessmen are worried that the extreme 
right is about to install a new de facto government. They report 
that they [not further identified] have asked for the return of 
Robert Malval as prime minister, a post he left with disgust 
last December. They believe that having a legitimate leader in 
this post could fill the temporal vacuum and reduce the 
necessity to fill it. 
  Someone close to Malval refused to confirm or to deny the 
speculation, stating that any approach might be be considered. I 
cannot reject that, this official said. Depending on how it is 
presented, Malval would have to wait and see of what the offer 
consists. [passage omitted]

sufficient to cover the repair fees, he added, so a lottery has 
been organized to help the administration with its undertakings. 
  Sampeur notes that at one time, the UN Development Program 
[PNUD] had drawn up a list [not further identified] to help the 
station, but this was destroyed in the crush of the 30 September 
1991 events. He nevertheless pointed out that this help will

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, 6 May (AFP) -- Justice 
Prosecutor General Arturo Becerra has reported the Chiapas 
Justice Prosecutor's Office has dispatched 60 policemen to the 
village of Bochil, where the presence of 300 armed men was 
reported several days ago. 
  Another group of policemen is already working in the region 
trying to determine the whereabouts of two inmates who on the 
morning of 4 May were broken out of prison by the group of armed 
men, who had their faces painted black and covered with 
kerchiefs. 
  According to Becerra, armed individuals with their faces 
covered, allegedly planning to release other prison inmates, 
have been seen near Bochil, a town of approximately 15,000 
residents located some 150 km north of Tuxtla Gutierrez. The two 
prison inmates were serving time for rustling. 
  The Zapatist National Liberation Movement started an armed 
uprising in this state on 1 January, suspended military actions, 
and is presently holding peace talks with the federal government.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Santoyo from Chiapas for the "ACIR Radio </F>
News" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner 
for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas; Samuel Ruiz, bishop of 
San Cristobal de las Casas; and members of the EZLN [Zapatist 
National Liberation Army] general staff issued a joint 
communique stating that consultations with the EZLN rank and 
file are continuing in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, the 
results of which will be disclosed in coming days. Here is Juan 
Santoyo with a report: 
  [Santoyo] Good afternoon. No major announcements followed 
the second meeting with Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis, 
mediator Samuel Ruiz, and the 10 members of the EZLN general 
staff. The parties merely pledged that they will make new 
contacts in upcoming weeks and that the EZLN will, in the coming 
days, comply with the 36 points agreed upon in San Cristobal de 
las Casas. At the meeting held in nearby Guadalupe Tepeyac, 
Monsignor Ruiz said the EZLN has resumed consultations for peace 
negotiations. Msgr. Ruiz also expressed concern over recent 
events that at any moment could hinder the peace process. He 
emphasized, however, that major difficulties have been overcome 
and current conditions are very different. Ruiz also referred 
to Camacho Solis' statements during the meeting with the EZLN. 
  [Begin Ruiz recording] Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis 
referred to progress in the EZLN's compliance with the San 
Cristobal commitments. He said the conditions are right for 
prompt compliance with those commitments. The key issue at 
hand, he added, is peace negotiations in Chiapas that restore 
tranquillity nationwide. The parties agreed to maintain contact 
in the coming weeks. [end recording] 
  [Santoyo] Following these comments on Camacho's meeting with 
the EZLN, Ruiz reiterated that the parties have agreed to meet 
again but gave no specific date. Camacho Solis, who was also 
asked about the meeting, said it took place at a location chosen 
by the EZLN near Guadalupe Tepeyac and that it lasted over six 
hours. 
  [Begin Camacho recording] The meeting was attended by 10 
representatives of the EZLN, and they also kept the area under 
very tight surveillance. Before the meeting, EZLN followers and 
ordinary citizens demonstrated to voice their views and 
political demands. Subcommander Marcos also attended the 
meeting. [end recording] 
  [Santoyo] Reports added that some residents of San Cristobal 
de las Casas, who were listening to Camacho Solis and Msgr. 
Ruiz, were somewhat disappointed because they thought more 
concrete agreements had been reached. Many residents expected 
to hear that a specific date had been set to sign a peace 
agreement. 
  [Announcer] Although no specific dates were set, this 
meeting 
with the EZLN in the Lacandon jungle was significant. For one 
thing, Camacho Solis stated that this consultation process among 
all the EZLN members in the area may set the stage for another 
meeting and a continuation of the peace dialogue. This 
opportunity is likely to arise once EZLN discussions on 
proposals and counterproposals to petitions made in the first 
phase of the peace talks conclude. 
  [Santoyo] Yes, those are the prospects, but we must also 
raise a point made by the EZLN members themselves. It is true 
that they have currently resumed their consultations, but they 
are also asking the entire country, including all peasant and 
social organizations, to conduct surveys on the 36 points agreed 
upon in San Cristobal de las Casas. The EZLN seeks to include 
those surveys in the second phase of the peace dialogue and use 
them to draft their response to the 36-point San Cristobal 
agreement. Many observers are following this situation very 
closely, basically because it constitutes an effort by the EZLN 
to make their internal consultations a national matter, which 
could cause some delay. 
  The EZLN is expected to give a definitive answer to the 36 
points in the coming days -- whether it agrees or disagrees -- 
and at that juncture set a date for the second phase. In 
addition, rumors have mushroomed here in San Cristobal since 
Msgr. Ruiz revealed a few days ago that he had plans to travel 
to Rome. When asked about this trip, his closest associates 
said they were awaiting a definitive answer following the 
meeting with the EZLN to know whether Msgr. Ruiz will leave 
tomorrow for Rome to meet with top leaders of the Catholic 
Church as well as to discuss the Chiapas situation. Msgr. Ruiz' 
trip to Rome has not been confirmed yet, but rumors are strong. 
Some say Msgr. Ruiz might return from Rome in 15 days when an 
answer is likely to be ready and the date for a second talk set.

  [Text] The 11th meeting of the Joint Mexican-EC Commission, 
held 28-29 April, agreed to establish a commercial subpanel that 
will review, among other topics, obstacles to bilateral 
relations -- specifically, bilateral market access issues -- and 
will explore formulas to enhance unity. 
  The Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat issued a 
communique announcing the creation of the subpanel. The 
communique added that in his speech in Brussels, Herminio Blanco 
Mendoza, under secretary for international trade negotiations, 
assessed President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's economic and 
social policy, which seeks to improve the distribution of income 
and combat extreme poverty. 
  During this meeting, Blanco Mendoza stressed the need to 
create jobs and raise the competitiveness of Mexico's productive 
sector. He said the government's efforts in these areas have 
gotten under way through the utilization of four complementary 
strategies. These strategies are: achieving macroeconomic 
stability; consolidating trade opening; deregulating various 
sectors of the economy; and expanding bilateral, subregional, 
and multilateral negotiations to open and reinforce markets. 
  Foreign Under Secretary Antonio de Icaza, in turn, noted 
that 
new circumstances were affecting Mexico and the world, and he 
stressed that Mexico was undergoing a deep-rooted transformation 
to adapt to the new situation. In this regard, it should be 
stressed that Mexico, besides being a founder of the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has joined the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and will soon join the 
OECD. In addition, NAFTA will provide Mexico with the means to 
consolidate structural changes and to achieve an efficient 
incorporation into the world economy. 
  In discussing the nation's recent evolution, De Icaza 
highlighted the national political agreement reached a short 
time ago and the different electoral reforms and other pacts 
that consolidate democracy and strengthen its institutions. 
  Juan Prat, general director in charge of North-South 
relations, noted that greater emphasis on economic cooperation 
constitutes a solution to the new situation in Latin America by 
encouraging activities of mutual interest that will reinforce 
regional reform.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Relations Secretary Manuel </F>
Tello and Navy Secretary Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo by reporters 
Elena Gallegos and Emilio Lomas; at El Zocalo on 5 May] 
  [Excerpts] Foreign Relations Secretary Manuel Tello and 
Navy Secretary Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo have seen "nothing odd" 
in the Mexican Government's purchase of riot gear. Tello, 
however, admitted that the purchase could be viewed as untimely 
"because society is very sensitive about it; it has exaggerated 
the issue." 
  The two officials spoke with reporters briefly at El Zocalo, 
following the ceremony to mark the 132d anniversary of the 
Battle of Puebla. [passage omitted] 
  [Gallegos] What do you think about the purchase of riot 
gear? 
  [Ruano] I see nothing wrong with this. It is not unusual. 
  [Lomas] How much equipment does the Navy purchase annually? 
  [Ruano] I have no idea. Do you know who can tell you? A 
high-ranking officer, like Admiral Perez Elias. 
  [Gallegos] What do you think of the presence of U.S. 
military 
personnel at the border? 
  [Ruano] Which border? Ours or theirs? If it is their 
border, it is their territory; should they be in Chihuahua or 
Coahuila, it would be wrong. 
  [Gallegos] Is this a provocation? 
  [Ruano] No, it is not. Am I provoking you when I am 
hammering a nail inside my home? I think not, but anyway... 
  [Gallegos, interrupting] Are they harassing us? 
  [Ruano] They have no need to harass us. You know that. 
There are many ways to harass.... Well, there is something we 
must take into account: By allowing illegal aliens to cross the 
border, we are causing trouble for them. Of course I agree with 
my fellow countrymen, but they (the Americans) have their own 
problems. Therefore, I believe the presence along the border is 
not affecting us. 
  Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello said in other countries, like 
France -- where he served as ambassador -- it is common to 
purchase riot gear. He insisted that society is very touchy 
today, and, in turn, people have exaggerated this issue.

<F P=106> [Report by Lourdes Edith Rudino] </F>
  [Text] The Prosecutor General's Office (PGR) has decided 
not to take legal action against Agriculture and Hydraulic 
Resources (SARH) Secretary Carlos Hank Gonzalez and his private 
secretary Juan Carlos Gomez Aranda because there is no evidence 
of the crimes alleged by the National Action Party (PAN) a few 
days ago. 
  Last night, Gonzalez himself reported that the charges 
against him are baseless because the only evidence offered by 
PAN was a photocopy of what is supposed to be a card belonging 
to Gomez Aranda. He said, however, that the document is only a 
blurred copy, which is no evidence whatsoever. 
  Gonzalez had previously been supported by the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI) through Fernando Ortiz Aranda, 
president of the National Executive Committee, who said there 
was no evidence that he had misused SARH funds or equipment to 
support PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo. The PRI 
leader referred to the charges against the SARH secretary as "an 
action seeking political sensationalism for electoral purposes." 
  The PGR said that, according to preliminary investigation 
No. 
2979/94, lodged at table 45 of the Special Prosecutor's Office 
for Crimes Committed by Public Servants [Fiscalia Especial de 
Delitos Cometidos por Servidores Publicos] and filed as case No. 
41/II/94, the Federal Attorney General's Office decided that 
there is no basis to the charges other than PAN's accusations, 
which makes the case "weak and unsubstantiated." 
  At a news conference, Gonzalez said Gomez Aranda did, in 
fact, work in support of Zedillo's candidacy, but did so outside 
his eight hours of SARH work and that the supplies were from 
Gomez Aranda's private office where certain communications 
originated. He said the report was simply an instrument to try 
to belittle "some people, basically me, and to see whether the 
embarrassment would generate a conflict within the PRI." 
Gonzales added that attempts were made to divide the party, but 
"they did not manage to and will not be able to." 
  Gonzalez explained that the funds used to pay for the 
pro-Zedillo advertisement that appeared in 10 Mexico City 
newspapers were from his personal funds and funds from five 
other persons, whom he did not wish to identify and who, as a 
group of friends, decided to invite 51 other persons to sign the 
advertisement. 
  Gonzalez said he had handed over as evidence in his defense 
a 
copy of check No. 222 from his personal account at the National 
Bank of Mexico (Banamex) for 236,144 pesos made out to Ferrer 
Publicity, the firm that contracted the advertisement. 
  He said he is not interested in countersuing the PAN, 
because 
"I do not like wasting time." He emphasized the difference 
between his role as a private citizen and his work as a public 
official, which does not prevent him from lending political 
support. Gonzalez added he will continue to support his party 
and candidate all his life. Even though the news conference 
lasted only 20 minutes, Gonzalez appeared nervous with 
reporters' questions.

<F P=106> [Report by Mario Jovel from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani today criticized death 
threats by a clandestine group against leftist leaders after 
noting that this attitude shows the lack of ability of certain 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] sectors to join 
the democratic system. Cristiani said the self-styled 
Salvadoran Revolutionary Front will be investigated and those 
responsible for the threats will be brought to justice. 
  According to President Cristiani, the FMLN's internal 
problems do not have to adversely affect the country's stability 
because it is a matter of differences within a political party. 
According to the president, the FMLN should divide itself once 
and for all into two parties to end the problem. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] If there really are people 
within 
the FMLN that are solving these types of problems with violence, 
they are demonstrating their lack of ability to join a 
democratic process and their lack of tolerance for differences 
of opinion. [end recording] 
  In addition, the head of state said labor code reforms 
created a tripartite commission that will work as an entity to 
advise the Labor Ministry. According to Cristiani, what remains 
to be done is to decide if the Forum for Economic and Social 
Consensus will continue as it is or if discussions will be 
incorporated at the Labor Council, which has been given a 
permanent mandate. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] Now that this council has been 
reactivated, we hope it can become a permanent council so that 
talks can be held here. I believe, however, that the decision 
will have to be made at the Forum for Concerted Effort. [end 
recording] 
  Cristiani also confirmed that an energy plan has been 
proposed to the Honduran Government, which is currently facing 
an electricity crisis. The president said this will not 
adversely affect the country and there will be no rationing. 
The proposal consists of an interconnection with Honduras 
because Honduras is the only country in the region that does not 
have an energy interconnection with El Salvador. It also 
includes the construction by both countries of El Tigre 
Hydroelectric Dam. The El Tigre Dam, with the waters of the 
Torola and Lempa Rivers, would increase the production of 
electricity by 150 megawatts for each country. El Salvador's 
three dams together produce 500 megawatts.

  [Text] Joaquin Villalobos and deputies Guadalupe Martinez 
and Eduardo Sancho, members of the People's Revitalizing 
Expression [ERP] and National Resistance [RN] factions of the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN], yesterday 
downplayed the alleged death threats issued by a ghost group. 
  The threats were made on Thursday night through a communique 
signed by the Salvadoran Revolutionary Front [FRS] and read on 
several radio stations. In the communique the FRS threatened to 
kill Villalobos, Martinez, and Sancho, whom it accuses of being 
"traitors to the revolution and to the spirit of the peace 
agreements." 
  According to the report, these leaders disregarded 
directives 
issued by the FMLN Directorate, resulting in division within the 
ranks of the former guerrilla organization. Martinez and Sancho 
accepted seats in the Salvadoran National Assembly Directorate, 
and five other deputies supported the candidacy of current 
Assembly President Gloria Salguero Gross. This decision created 
heated friction between 21 colleagues who won seats in the 
Assembly. 
  "I do not worry about anonymous threats; they are the result 
of the opportunity created by discrepancies within the FMLN," 
Villalobos said. The former guerrilla fighter denied that the 
charges are sponsored by members of parties that are annoyed 
with the RN and the ERP -- the Communist Party of El Salvador 
(PCES), the Farabundo Marti People's Liberation Forces (FPL), 
and the Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers (PRTC). 
  Nevertheless, he accused these groups of having discussions 
with the left in a "fanatical" way that may provoke violent 
actions. Villalobos, leader of what is now considered the social 
democratic current in the FMLN, stated that the communique might 
be the work of extremist left- or right-wing groups that 
"disagree with the debate currently under way." Villalobos 
issued an appeal to leading FMLN groups, urging them to stop 
signing newspaper communiques that predict expulsions and 
sanctions characterized by what he termed "fanatical attitudes." 
  Meanwhile, Deputies Ana Guadalupe Martinez and Eduardo 
Sancho 
said they are not afraid of their former comrades in arms and 
they consider the threats to be part of a psychological campaign 
launched by radical left- or right-wing groups. 
  Martinez considers an assassination at this point to be out 
of the democratic context that prevails in the country, saying: 
"I hope only a small group wrote the communique and published it 
in the media. If an assassination occurs, we would be returning 
to the past." 
  Referring to this, Legislative Assembly President Gloria 
Salguero Gross asked the FMLN to unite, work in harmony, and 
legislate in favor of the people. The deputy asked the people 
who sent the communique to "reflect," because "violence is no 
longer an option." 
  A similar statement was issued by Deputy Gerardo Suvillaga, 
who condemned the manifesto from the self-styled FRS, and he 
asked the FMLN to settle its disputes. Meanwhile, Defense 
Minister Humberto Corado said the anonymous communiques are not 
consistent with the new political reality, because "there are 
opportunities for any tendency to publicly state its position."

<F P=106> ["Press Communique" issued by the Political Commission and </F>
Deputies of the Peoples Revitalizing Expression and the National 
Resistance of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in 
El Salvador; date not given] 
  [Text] The deputies and members of the Political Commission 
of the FMLN, on behalf of the National Resistance, RN, and the 
Peoples Revitalizing Expression, ERP, hereby make it known that: 
  1. We regret the emotional reactions of FMLN comrades over 
the fact that a group of FMLN deputies exercised its legal right 
to nominate and be nominated for positions on the Legislative 
Assembly's Board of Directors. 
  2. It concerns us that offensive and fallacious attitudes 
are being fostered in the internal debate. There is talk of 
expulsions or punishment, impossible to apply to something that 
is legal and normal for any democratic party in the world. This 
attitude projects an image of the FMLN as an authoritarian party. 
  3. We appeal to the FPL [Popular Liberation Forces], the PC 
[Communist Party of El Salvador], and the PRTC [Revolutionary 
Party of Central American Workers] to remain calm and to 
seriously pursue a new internal agreement. This agreement 
should define the terms of the alliance between the two 
tendencies that throughout the FMLN's history have existed and 
that have had innumerable differences. The war is over. None 
of the currents can any longer be a political prisoner for 
attempting to maintain the image of a united party that has 
never really existed. The political identity of each tendency 
is as important as our alliance in facing the right wing. 
  4. We hereby suggest that there be a mature debate of the 
main points that differentiate us, such as the true or apparent 
acceptance of a market economy and private property, the 
struggle inside the system or control of the system, the 
validity or invalidity of Marxist-Leninist precepts, the 
acceptance that we are living a new reality in a developing 
democratic process while defending the challenging and 
confrontational manner of speech or political style. 
  5. We believe that the parliament's work is a matter of 
dialogue, negotiations, and agreements among political parties. 
This is why deputies are elected. This is why we never 
considered as negative the search for understanding that 
comrades in the FPL, PC, and the PRTC undertook with ARENA 
[Nationalist Republican Alliance] with regard to holding 
positions on the Board of Directors. We want to point out to 
you that it was a political error not to make proposals on the 
day established for this. Because of this, you projected an 
image of rejecting the system that was not positive while you 
lost the opportunity for the plenum to chose you. We always 
made it known to you that we would nominate candidates if we did 
not reach consensus on this point and if the majority tried to 
impose nominations on us. We have not acted behind anyone's 
back nor was there any need to reach agreement with anyone. We 
only nominated candidates according to the deadline, setting 
aside for subsequent discussion the problems of the Assembly's 
internal rules. 
  6. The RN and the ERP reconfirm their support for the left 
wing's renovation and modernization in keeping with the new 
realities of peace, thus effectively defending the popular 
interest. We reject challenging and anti-system attitudes that 
seek to soothe the ideologically conscious but that do not 
produce specific results for the people, while projecting a 
war-mongering and conflictive image that alienates the support 
of the vast majority. We favor strengthening our credibility as 
a political party that is satisfied with the rules of the game 
and that accepts and respects its adversaries. In this way its 
coming to power does not constitute a threat to any sector of 
Salvadoran society. 
  [signed] ERP and RN Political Commission and Deputies

<F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Eduardo Sancho and the rest of the ERP [Peoples 
Revitalizing Expression] and National Resistance deputies in the 
Assembly expressed their opinions on the other parties that 
still make up the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front), saying they are not political or mature. 
  [Begin Joaquin Villalobos, ERP secretary general, recording] 
The image of the FMLN that emerges is troublesome, because it 
depicts us as authoritarian, as calling attention to a deputy 
who dares to vote differently from the majority. Just imagine 
what would happen if in the United States the Republicans and 
the Democrats who always vote together were told that they would 
be thrown out of the party. Or say this were to happen in 
France or Austria or any civilized country. 
  We call on our companeros in the leadership of other 
organizations to reinitiate discussions to try and devise a new 
internal agreement that defines the terms of the FMLN alliance. 
There have always been differences in the FMLN. There are two 
persuasions. During the war the differences were not as obvious 
because we had to be united. Once the war ended and things 
opened up at the parliamentary level, we no longer had to accept 
circumstances where they could impose a majority or minority by 
three to two. Then differences became more noticeable. 
  It's no big deal; it's just democracy. That's what's 
happening. We think that political identity is as important as 
maintaining the alliance within the front. We think discussions 
should be held within the FMLN on the issues on which we differ, 
for example the apparent versus the genuine acceptance of the 
market economy and private property, the position on the 
existence of the Armed Forces, and the validity or invalidity of 
Marxism-Leninism, all of which are basic topics on which we have 
differences, not on other things. 
  It's as if it's a sin if there are talks with ARENA 
[Nationalist Republican Alliance] or if someone from ARENA votes 
for the FMLN or if someone in the FMLN votes for ARENA. That's 
illogical. Whoever cannot understand this should go back to the 
mountains. [end recording] 
  For his part, Eduardo Sancho said that at this time there 
cannot be two positions, noting that the party's political line 
needs to be defined because people want the country to be 
democratized and want the peace agreements to be fulfilled. 
  Both men described as irrational the possibility that the 
party might expel some members. 
  [Begin Villalobos recording] We do concede that this is an 
emotional issue. It isn't politically or legally rational. 
There is no basis for it. I think the problem is that it's 
difficult for fellow party members to accept the situation. 
  We took a historic step on Sunday. We sent an important 
signal to the majority of the people in this country. We are 
not happy with the changes in this country. They didn't want to 
accept that. This is the main point. What impact will this have 
on our international relationships with democratic parties that 
are used to these kinds of things? 
  One of these days we will see some FMLN member penalized 
because he voted differently. But this the most normal thing in 
the world. This is impossible, both politically or legally. 
There is no basis for this in the statutes. 
  We will not leave the FMLN just because we favor modernizing 
the left. We are the FMLN. We are not intellectuals. We did 
not study Marxism in Costa Rica. We went to the front to work. 
We learned in prison. We survived difficult situations 17 
times. We are all full-fledged members of the FMLN. We each 
have an I.D. and a historical identity. We who fought on the 
streets will now fight politically. We are proud of our past. 
In the name of the FMLN, I participated in the historic 
meeting. It was I who proposed this banner and this name. 
Eduardo and I made the most important proposals in the 
negotiations. You are familiar with the military strategy and 
know what everyone says about where it originated. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with General Luis Alonso Discua </F>
Elvir, commander of the Honduran Armed Forces, by Danilo 
Izaguirre; place and date not given; from the "Morning Paper" 
newscast--recorded] 
  [Text] [Izaguirre] We are talking with General Discua on 
Congress' most recent decision to turn the obligatory military 
service into a voluntary one. What is the Army commander's 
position? 
  [Discua] In the name of the Honduran people, I would like to 
congratulate the deputies, our people's representatives, for a 
decision yesterday befitting of the Honduran people, including 
the Armed Forces. A political decision has been made on this 
issue. We have always criticized the methods used in 
recruitment, because we regarded it as wrong. At that time we 
did not have the political decision President Reina made now to 
work on this aspect. I think his decision is right. The 
Honduran people have duties to perform. Now there is a political 
willingness to be carried out. 
  [Izaguirre] Do you people believe this decision is one made 
by the Armed Forces commander in chief, the president of the 
Republic, rather than by the Armed Forces as an institution? 
  [Discua] Correct. The Armed Forces are a nondeliberating 
body and as such obey the decisions made by the commander in 
chief, the president of the Republic. This position again 
establishes the fact we are a permanent, national institution; 
we are not a temporary institution. We are one of the columns 
of this country's democracy. At no time have the Armed Forces 
lent themselves to the promotion of internal disorder. We 
support the democratic system, just as we did during the past 
elections, and keep supporting it. The institution is permanent. 
  [Izaguirre] Does this mean no person or institution knocking 
on the Armed Forces' doors can possibly use them for personal or 
group gain because the Armed Forces have already defined their 
position on the role of the Armed Forces? 
  [Discua] The Armed Forces' new role has been clearly 
defined. 
Armed institutions in Latin America play a fundamental role on 
which the people's will rests entirely. This will is expressed 
in the free election of officials to govern the country in a 
democratic system. The Armed Forces will always stay alert. No 
individuals or groups will ever be able to thwart the role the 
Armed Forces play in the state. The Armed Forces are born with 
the mandate to defend the state's sovereignty and the people's 
rights and preserve internal order; this is the Armed Forces' 
clear and fundamental role. We have assumed another great 
responsibility, which we already had, according to the 
Constitution, concerning education. 
  [Izaguirre] I talked with General Humberto Regalado, who 
held 
the same post as you. I would like you to discuss the people's 
reports that the Army's recruitment is brutal. How are recruits 
treated? 
  [Discua] An armed institution must have soldiers that have a 
definite conviction. They must have an esprit de corps and a 
physical condition fit to deal with any situation that might 
arise. The Armed Forces have been trained to defend the country 
and preserve internal order. There is something taken for 
granted in the Armed Forces: discipline, loyalty, and respect, 
all of which must be strengthened. Character is formed by 
(?strict) discipline, such as the one we maintain. Recruitment 
in the past had some defects, because there was no political 
willingness. We now have a considerably updated and modern 
military service law. This law clearly defines how recruitment 
must be handled; unfortunately, there was never a political 
willingness to enforce the law. 
  [Izaguirre] There was a lack not only of political 
willingness but of a desire to obey the law. I understand that 
the state must advise the Armed Forces of those who must render 
military service. 
  [Discua] Correct. Serving in the Armed Forces is a duty 
clearly defined in Article 40 of the Constitution. To render 
military service is a citizen's duty. Details are now being 
clarified, but we had already typified them in the Military 
Service Law, which describes those who must render this service 
and the way this service must be rendered. Congress has now 
made the courageous decision of amending a Constitution article 
under the president's initiative. I think we are on the right 
track. 
  [Izaguirre] There is general concern among the people, and 
you are the person who can explain the truth to the Honduran 
people. This is their concern: What will happen in this 
transition period -- that is to say, the time that will pass 
before the amendment to Article 276 of the Constitution is goes 
into force? How will recruitment be conducted between now and 
the time the decree goes into effect? 
  [Discua] First, the Military Service Law is in effect. It is 
true that the reform has been approved, but it must be ratified 
by the second legislature. Therefore, the Military Service Law 
is in force. According to this law, it is the responsibility of 
the executive -- namely, the commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces -- to fill the vacancies in the Armed Forces. 
  [Izaguirre] Some people also say that this temporal gap will 
be used by the Armed Forces to forcefully recruit personnel. 
Are the Armed Forces planning to carry out forceful recruitment 
during this time? 
  [Discua] No, but there exists a constitutional duty to 
recruit, according to Article 40. In addition, the Military 
Service Law is in force. There are many procedures. I do not 
have a copy of the law with me at this moment, but the Military 
Service Law is clearly established and it remains in force. 
  There are drafts and boards. There is the Military 
Enlistment Board, comprising the government minister and the 
Armed Forces commander or his delegate. There are also 
departmental boards, governors, and regional chiefs. We also 
have mayors. We will issue draft documents to the approximately 
1.2 million citizens who, according to the Constitution, have a 
duty to serve in the military. Of this 1.2 million, less than 1 
percent will be recruited into military units, whose sleeping 
quarters, diners, and schools have been improved. The 
Constitution establishes this service as a citizen's duty. 
  [Izaguirre] When this proposal was presented, were the Armed 
Forces consulted on the economic repercussions of the proposal? 
It is one of the important factors in this issue. To make 
military service educational, voluntary, humanistic, and so on, 
money is necessary. According to the president, military 
service must be made attractive. Has this been discussed? Is 
the country prepared for this? 
  [Discua] The president of the Republic has been adequately 
clear on this situation. I think he has a clear, well-defined 
answer. We have a new role in education. Rather, we already 
had this role, but now it has been defined. We must contribute 
to education in the country. I want to tell you something, 
Danilo: We have always had secondary schools, trade schools, and 
primary schools. I want to make something clear once and for 
all. Adult Hondurans dislike attending school or studying. 
When we have recruits in our units, we must force them to 
attend secondary schools and primary schools. These recruits, 
however, do everything imaginable to avoid going to school. We 
see the results of this in the number of dropouts in primary and 
secondary schools.

<F P=106> [Report by Filadelfo Martinez] </F>
  [Text] Managua, 7 May (EFE) -- The Nicaraguan Government 
closed the chapter on negotiations with armed groups and this 
weekend sent a combined military force backed by aerial units to 
pursue "bands of criminals" responsible for robbery, cattle 
rustling, kidnapping, and rape. 
  Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta and Major General 
Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo, chief of the Sandinist People's Army 
general staff, met late this week to implement a joint Armed 
Forces-National Police plan to stamp out violence in rural 
areas. Soviet-made MI-17 helicopters are being used to 
transport troops and logistical supplies and to observe the 
movement of armed groups in the mountains in the country's 
central and northern regions in this operation against "bands of 
armed delinquents." 
  "The important thing in this case is the will of the 
Nicaraguan state to eliminate this cancer ("armed groups")," 
army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock told the 
local press. 
  Deputy Government Minister Joaquin Lovo stressed that with 
the 15 April disbandment of some 600 armed men who were led for 
two years by Jose Angel Talavera, alias El Chacal, the 
government closed the chapter on talks and negotiations to get 
the rebels to lay down their weapons. 
  According to this official, close to 500 of these men are 
involved in such actions "part time," since they spend some days 
working the land and other days breaking the law. 
  Lovo said the civilian population, chiefly farmers and 
peasants, "feels imprisoned by these bands," which operate near 
El Tuma-La Dalia, Pantasma-Muy Muy, Pantasma-Quilali, and Muelle 
de los Bueyes and use the names of various organizations for 
their criminal activities. 
  "This is no longer a matter of (rearmed) groups making 
socioeconomic and political demands but of strictly criminal 
bands, and we are hitting them," he noted. 
  Although a large-scale military offensive is under way, Lovo 
affirmed the idea is not to "exterminate" the groups but to 
capture their members for trial. That is why he asked the 
Supreme Court of Justice to send "auxiliary judges" to the north. 
  The deputy minister noted that Ciriaco Palacios, alias 
Charrito, who is heading one of the most belligerent bands, was 
given a job in the Special Disarmament Brigades (BED) with a 
salary of $500 following his surrender last year. 
  Instead of helping disarm civilians carrying war weapons, 
Charrito murdered a BED chief and stole a lot of rifles, 
according to the official. 
  Lovo said BED officials tried unsuccessfully to talk with 
Charrito on six occasions, so the authorities will not agree to 
meet with him now. 
  Charrito continues to seek a meeting with members of 
Cardinal 
Miguel Obando y Bravo's verification commission to present his 
conditions for surrender. 
  The former 3-80 Northern Front forces headed by El Chacal 
have organized an agricultural and livestock cooperative devoted 
to harvesting coffee and basic grains and raising cattle on over 
3,000 hectares in the north. A state bank granted these former 
rebels a $1 million loan to acquire the land. They have several 
years to repay the loan. 
  El Chacal voiced his concern over the lack of an agreement 
between the Government Ministry and the National Police for 500 
former recontras to take over police precincts in 13 northern 
municipalities, in accordance with the agreements signed with 
the government.

  [Text] Managua, 7 May (DPA) -- Charrito [Ciriaco Palacios] 
and Northiel [Wilfredo Gutierrez or Wilfredo Chavarria], two 
recontra leaders, have made death threats against Cardinal 
Miguel Obando y Bravo, Esteli Bishop Monsignor Juan Abelardo 
Mata, and parish priest Octaviano Rodriguez, Managua's morning 
newspaper LA TRIBUNA reported today. 
  According to the publication, the religious leaders were 
threatened because they favor the disarmament of the group of 
former rebels organized in the 3-80 Northern Front, which 
surrendered its weapons and returned to civilian society. 
  The bishop of Esteli, a city located more than 100 km north 
of Managua, said the armed groups "have been telling the 
peasants they are going to kill us because we helped El Chacal 
(Jose Angel Talavera, who was the leader of the 3-80 Northern 
Front) to demobilize." 
  The armed groups are being pursued by Army and police troops 
following an order by Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro to 
eradicate the armed gangs that have committed murders, 
robberies, and kidnappings. 
  Esteli Bishop Mata received death threats last year from the 
pro-Sandinist Peasant-Worker Revolutionary Front (FROC).

<F P=106> [Article by Noel Irias] </F>
  [Text] The majority of Sandinists interviewed by the 
Nicaraguan Studies Institute (IEN) believe that caudillismo 
exists within the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] and 
that the party has lost the support of part of its rank and 
file, according to a study entitled "The FSLN: A Study of Its 
Dynamics and Outlooks Based on the Opinion of the Rank and File." 
  The study is based on 191 in-depth interviews with FSLN 
militants and sympathizers in neighborhoods across the country. 
IEN Director Rodolfo Delgado reports participants were selected 
from lists provided by the FSLN Leadership Committees in each 
department. 
  The study's introduction reveals that, despite the loss of 
credibility, the FSLN has maintained a solid social base of 
approximately 23 percent of the population. 
  The document claims, however, this social base is not broad 
enough to win the elections in 1996, much less when the support 
is a mere 12 percent among the peasants and barely 8 percent 
among the majority of the uneducated poor. 
  According to the IEN's final report, 55 percent of those 
interviewed believe caudillismo exists within the FSLN. To them 
the term caudillismo means "a perpetuation of power that 
prevents the natural evolution of historical change." Forty-one 
percent of those interviewed believe that phenomenon does not 
exist within the FSLN. 
  Thirty-seven percent of those who believe caudillismo exists 
within the FSLN "see the danger of succumbing to a lifelong 
leadership." 
  "They believe caudillismo affects the image of the 
democratization of the FSLN, pointing out there should be more 
than one leader. The leadership should be broad and diverse at 
every level," the study states. 
  According to the study, there is agreement on the 
advisability of having the FSLN secretary general elected by the 
national convention from a list of candidates provided by 
members of the rank and file. 
  "They believe almost unanimously it would be advisable to 
elect the FSLN secretary general from two or more candidates. 
That would send a meaningful, democratic signal to the party 
and to the Nicaraguan people," the IEN report states. 
  Among the most disturbing aspects of the study is that 56 
percent of those interviewed believe the FSLN has lost popular 
support due to the crisis the party is experiencing, its neglect 
of the rank and file and the countryside, and the incorrect 
methods of struggle used, among other things. 
  Regarding the different political currents within the FSLN, 
the majority, 54 percent, believe these currents are hindering 
the FSLN's progress, and 44 percent believe they are the result 
of "a struggle for power." 
  Fifty-eight percent of those interviewed say they have no 
preference for any current, because they are interested in the 
FSLN's unity and principles, while "16 percent favor the 
Democratic Left, and 5 percent favor the Renovating Current." 
  The IEN questionnaire included the question: "Do you believe 
the FSLN has been involved in violent acts in the past three 
years?" Fifty-one percent answered "not as a political party, 
though some of its members have participated in violent acts." 
  Those interviewed believe "even though the government 
initiates institutionalized violence with its neoliberal 
policies, the FSLN cannot and should not respond with violent 
demands or protests that can lead to tragic events that affect 
the image" of the party. 
  The IEN study will be presented on 6 May at the Olof Palme 
Convention Center. Among those expected to attend the 
presentation are Mario Solorzano, Socialist International vice 
president, Daniel Ortega, Sergio Ramirez, Carlos Fernando 
Chamorro, Victor Hugo Tinoco, Orlando Nunez, and Oscar Rene 
Vargas.

  [Text] The change of command in the Sandinist People's Army 
(EPS) "will take time, perhaps months," Major General Joaquin 
Cuadra Lacayo, General Humberto Ortega Saavedra's virtual 
replacement, said yesterday. 
  Maj. Gen. Cuadra yesterday represented the EPS at an 
official 
function the National Assembly held in honor of Taiwanese 
President Li Teng-hui. Cuadra was accompanied at all times by 
Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock, Armed Forces public 
relations chief. 
  Days earlier, Wheelock also accompanied Cuadra when he held 
a 
news conference in Matagalpa to discuss military operations 
against criminal groups. Since then, the EPS chief of staff has 
been seen more frequently in public. According to the command 
roster, he is Gen. Ortega's virtual successor. 
  "In all armies there is a transition period in which the 
chief of a unit must turn over everything in order," Cuadra 
insisted. 
  We then asked the high-ranking EPS officer: "In the case of 
the Army, how long will this process take?" He responded: "It 
will be a prudent period of time, which will be very clear under 
the law... but do not worry, because you will learn about it in 
coming days." 
  Regarding the honors that Gen. Ortega might receive after he 
retires, Cuadra said this is not included in the Military 
Organization Law. Nevertheless, he said, "Gen. Ortega has made 
many contributions to the country and will continue to do so. 
Therefore he deserves society's recognition." 
<H5>  Lacayo: No More Tensions </H5>
  Meanwhile, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo admitted that 
with the recent agreement between the Army and the executive and 
legislative branches on the Military Code and the Army chief's 
departure, the dispute with the military command has "finally 
and completely" ended. 
  Regarding the date for Gen. Ortega's departure, Lacayo 
replied: "Ask BARRICADA." On Wednesday, 4 May, this newspaper 
reported that an agreement had been reached on the date -- 21 
February 1995 -- during a "secret meeting" on 3 May. 
  Ramiro Gurdian, president of COSEP [Higher Council of 
Private 
Enterprise], said he hoped that Gen. Ortega's departure would 
come sooner, but he added that the date announced "is good, 
because it removes tension from the political environment." 
  Minister Lacayo confirmed the existence of a comprehensive 
plan against the criminal groups, as was announced by Gen. 
Ortega. 
  "This plan has been in operation since 15 April. I said in 
Jinotega that once the last group of the 3-80 Northern Front was 
demobilized, there would be opportunity to fight with firmness 
and a strong hand those robbers who are attacking producers," 
Lacayo added.

  [Text] Major General Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo of the Sandinist 
People's Army (EPS) yesterday virtually proclaimed himself 
Humberto Ortega's replacement as head of the Army once Ortega 
goes into retirement. 
  "If contemplated in the legal mechanisms and if they propose 
my name to fill the post, I would agree to become Army chief," 
Cuadra responded to a colleague's question. 
  Yesterday Cuadra represented the EPS at an official assembly 
of the legislative branch in honor of Taiwanese President Li 
Teng-hui. At the end of the official ceremony, Cuadra declared 
that the military change of command process could last months. 
  Last week, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo and EPS Chief 
Gen. Humberto Ortega announced during a seminar on 
civic-military relations that both state branches had reached an 
accord on Ortega's retirement. 
  The accord establishes that this year the president of the 
Republic and the supreme chief of the Armed Forces will appoint 
a new Army chief, in accordance with the current Constitution, 
and Ortega will officially retire in February 1995. 
  "Every Army contemplates a transition process during which 
the head of the military unit surrenders everything in order," 
Cuadra reiterated. 
  Ortega's virtual replacement as head of the military 
refrained from commenting on aspects of the Military 
Organization Law but stated that his current chief made many 
contributions to society "and thus deserves its recognition." 
  Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo declined to comment on 
the date for Ortega's retirement. 
  Lacayo stated that the recent accord reached by the 
executive 
and legislative branches and the EPS regarding the Military 
Reorganization Law "ended the tension." 
  Regarding the constitutional reforms, the high-ranking 
government official said the executive branch had sent a 
proposal to the legislature, and six days ago the legislative 
branch made a counterproposal.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Victor Zuleta from Potosi -- live] </F>
  [Excerpts] Peasant Francisco Cruz Talavera, who was 
believed to be dead, came forth yesterday afternoon to explain 
that he had been mistaken for the person who was taken to the 
local morgue on 2 May. As is known, Potosi peasant federation 
leaders first insisted that the dead person was Francisco Cruz, 
whose name was among those who were reported missing on 30 
April. Francisco Cruz's relatives and friends were confused by 
the features of the face and body of the remains that were 
found. [passage omitted] 
  Dozens of people insisted that they could recognize the body 
as belonging to Cruz, as there was an extraordinary resemblance 
between our fellow journalist and the features of the body that 
was found. In view of this reasonable piece of evidence, the 
mass media reported Cruz's supposed death. 
  In his first statement, Cruz said he had been at the site of 
the roadblock until they were forced into the hills of (Ocoruru) 
on 30 October. He said he decided to leave for (Pisuri), his 
home town, because of security reasons and because his wife was 
about to give birth to their seventh child. 
  In view of persistent reports of his death, Cruz decided to 
leave for Potosi at dawn yesterday, marching along with others 
who cheered him. Radio [name indistinct], which like other 
media reported Cruz's death, considered it necessary to issue a 
bulletin which in its main points reads: We have been able to 
ascertain that Francisco Cruz is alive, and that he is in Potosi 
to clarify reports disseminated by the mass media. In view of 
this, and as we have publicly expressed our firm willingness to 
help achieve peace in the country, we are hereby issuing this 
explanation so that the truth can prevail, in compliance with 
the teachings of the gospel that the truth will make us free.
