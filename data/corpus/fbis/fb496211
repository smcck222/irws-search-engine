  [Excerpt] Yesterday, Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said 
high-ranking U.S. officials, including U.S. State Secretary 
Warren Christopher and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor, 
have "openly" expressed their government's interest in 
negotiating a free trade agreement with Chile. 
  An official Foreign Ministry note states: "This has been 
confirmed publicly and unequivocally on several occasions. The 
only points requiring definition are the methods to be used, the 
bilateral agreement, membership to the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA), and the date to officially begin negotiating." 
  The foreign minister thus answered a report that an 
unidentified Foreign Ministry official had mentioned 
difficulties in the negotiations, or that Chile is not a 
priority for the United States in the free trade agreement. The 
mentioned report says, among other things, that the United 
States has made environmental demands that Chile cannot meet. 
  Figueroa said: "I want to say that such a report is 
absolutely false because all the information we gathered through 
the Foreign Ministry, the public, and through several involved 
U.S. Government officials, shows that negotiations between Chile 
and the United States over a free trade treaty or over joining 
the NAFTA are open and ready to go." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santiago, 5 May (EFE) -- The Chilean Government's 
decision to sign a cooperation agreement with Cuba has been 
endorsed by the leaders of the governing Coalition of Parties 
For Democracy. Members of the rightist opposition voiced 
skepticism. 
  Yesterday, 4 May, Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa 
Serrano confirmed the government's plan to sign a cooperation 
agreement with Cuba though he reiterated that an eventual 
resumption of diplomatic ties with Fidel Castro's government is 
not on the list of subjects that the Chilean Government will 
assess in the short term. 
  Today, Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona said his 
party "enthusiastically supports" the tightening of friendship 
and cooperation ties with the Cuban people. 
  Christian Democratic Party [PDC] President Gutenberg 
Martinez 
asserted his party is in favor of cooperating with Cuba "from a 
solidarity viewpoint in view of the difficulties the Cuban 
people are enduring," adding that cooperation "should be granted 
without imposing any conditions." Martinez also upheld the end 
of the U.S. economic embargo on the island because, in his 
opinion, this might encourage the Cuban authorities to implement 
a greater economic and political domestic opening. Martinez 
will preside over a PDC delegation that will travel to Cuba this 
month. 
  Chilean Communist Party leader Carlos Toro asked Eduardo 
Frei's government for the immediate normalization of diplomatic 
relations with Cuba while Radical Party President Senator 
Anselmo Sule commented that there is a certain degree of 
cooperation with Cuba. 
  Sule mentioned a $10 million credit the Chile State Bank 
recently granted the Cuban Government to finance the purchase of 
Chilean foodstuff and added that Chile can cooperate with Cuba 
"in several aspects." Sule said that among the incentives are 
the activities that some Chilean companies are developing in 
Cuba, the extension of export credits to that country, and the 
promotion of social development actions on the island. 
  The rightist Democratic Independent Union (UDI), voiced its 
agreement with the establishment of a cooperation program "that 
does not encourage the perpetuation of the current Cuban 
regime." UDI Senator Beltran Urenda, member of the Senate's 
Foreign Commission, believes any aid for Cuba "should seek a 
change in the Cuba Government, a democratic opening." He said 
"any support" that may help Fidel Castro's regime to remain in 
power "is dangerous."

  [Text] Carabineros (Acting) Director General Fernando 
Cordero has assured that relations between Carabineros and the 
government are absolutely normal and that it is not possible to 
say whether there is a winner or a loser. 
  He made this statement during a rally held to pay tribute to 
Carabineros martyrs at the memorial on Alameda Avenue corner 
with Namur Street. Cordero said the tribute is paid every year 
to dead Carabineros and to Carabineros martyrs. The institution 
is commemorating its 67th anniversary. 
  He also confirmed that General Rodolfo Stange did not attend 
the ceremony and that he is spending his leave in southern 
Chile. Cordero reiterated that Stange's request for leave 
without pay for another 60-day period is consistent with a 
previous decision to facilitate the investigation by the judge 
probing the so-called slain people case. 
  Asked about the dinner hosted on 2 May by President Eduardo 
Frei for the high command, he replied it was a "very pleasant" 
and "very interesting" meeting, adding that relations between 
the government and the Carabineros "are appropriate for the 
government and for a state institution like the Carabineros." 
He emphasized that relations are absolutely normal. "We must 
continue to work. There are many things to do," he said. 
  Asked about the influence of the situation affecting Gen. 
Stange on the Carabineros, Cordero replied: "The institution, as 
such, has not been harmed at all. It is a state institution 
that must continue working." He admitted, however, that 
"obviously, there have been personal problems, 
misinterpretation, and things like that, but the institution 
remains absolutely sound, united and at work, and this is the 
most important thing." 
  As to whether the government had "won a confrontation with 
the Carabineros," Cordero replied that "it is not a point of 
winning or defeating anyone. We are a state institution at the 
service of society and we cannot seek to either win or lose 
against anyone. We are state servants."

  [Text] President Gaviria spoke and other reactions 
followed. The presidential candidates and the police 
counternarcotics director support Gaviria and agree that 
personal consumption should not be legalized. 
  [Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate of the Conservative 
Party] I totally disagree with the Constitutional Court because 
Colombia is invaded by drugs. We are a drug-producing and 
drug-distributing country. If we open the doors to personal 
use, it will be like offering incentives to increase drug 
addiction rates. The laws must be obeyed, but there has been a 
flaw in the Court. I think we must look for mechanisms that 
will allow us not to be permissive. That is where we must 
direct our efforts. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What are the good and bad aspects of 
this court decision? 
  [Pastrana] Personally, I do not see anything good about it. 
  [Enrique Parejo, presidential candidate for the Democratic 
National Alternative] I think the Court has made a serious 
mistake. The decision could lead to a considerable increase in 
drug use in the country. If running a red light and thereby 
endangering the lives and physical wellbeing of persons is 
subject to sanction even if nothing happens, that is all the 
more reason why the use of drugs should be sanctioned. 
  [Miguel Maza, presidential candidate of the National Civic 
Consensus] For me, it is a legal absurdity. It is impossible to 
conceive of the law as a cold summation of a series of norms 
that are totally alien from the wishes and feelings of a people. 
After carefully analyzing the clamor made by mothers, fathers, 
the clergy, and the government in expressing their opinions, the 
only thing left for these five magistrates to do is resign.

  [Text] Government, political, and church sectors have 
expressed opposition to the Constitutional Court's decision to 
legalize personal doses of certain drugs. The impossible seems 
to have occurred in Colombia: Everyone agreed on the same issue. 
  National Drug Director Gabriel Vega, presidential candidates 
Andres Pastrana [Conservative Party]; Ernesto Samper [Liberal 
Party]; Antonio Navarro Wolff [19 April Movement Democratic 
Alliance]; Miguel Maza [National Civic Consensus]; and Episcopal 
Conference President Monsignor Pedro Rubiano oppose the decision. 
  [Begin recording] [Vega] I heard the court president say 
these drugs are similar to alcohol, which is untrue. I asked 
him how a child of 11, 12, 13, or 14 could make a responsible 
decision concerning drug use. 
  [Pastrana] I respect the court's decision, but I disagree 
with it. 
  [Samper] The legalization or acceptance of a personal dose 
in 
a country such as Colombia, which is known as a producer and 
where one assumes large quantities of drugs are readily 
available, constitutes a dangerous step. 
  [Navarro] I sincerely do not like the decision because it 
will not resolve the problem and will create a debate that will 
confuse many. 
  [Maza] I cannot understand how a court of such importance 
can 
manage to pass such a legal atrocity, knowingly, because they 
must know this: They are creating many ills for Colombia. 
  [Rubiano] In view of this country's realities and people, we 
must keep the common good in mind. I wonder what good it can do 
the country to legalize drugs now. [end recording]

  [Text] Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta's strong 
opposition to the Constitutional Court's recent decision has 
apparently weakened the legal arguments supporting the approval 
of the personal drug dose. 
  [Begin Arrieta recording] I disagree with the ruling, which 
I 
think is capable of creating complex legal, moral, social, and 
international problems in the country. In terms of the law, 
such a broad interpretation of personal freedom could create 
distortions that have no place in this government. We will soon 
find ourselves debating other social issues, such as euthanasia 
or suicide. Let us keep in mind that personal freedom cannot be 
extended to a point at which it harms society. [end recording]

  [Text] The most tumultuous debate in recent times in 
Colombia was unleashed today after the Constitutional Court 
decided to legalize the personal consumption of drugs such as 
marijuana and cocaine. The debate has reached a point that, 
going against the tradition of not speaking publicly, the 
Constitutional Court justices who opposed the decision are 
expressing their dissent. Here is a report by Juan Roberto 
Vargas: 
  [Begin recording] [Vargas] Good evening. We are here with 
one of the justices who dissented from the majority decision 
adopted by the Constitutional Court yesterday to decriminalize 
the consumption of drugs, that is to say, the use of the 
infamous personal dose of drugs. Dr. Jose Gregorio Hernandez, 
why did you dissent from this decision? 
  [Hernandez] I disagree with the decision because I believe 
the standard, or standards, declared unconstitutional by the 
Constitutional Court were, in fact, not unconstitutional. Just 
the opposite is true. Far from violating the Constitution, they 
extended it. The advancement of personal freedom [libre 
desarrollo de la personalidad] has limits within the 
Constitution. These limits basically involve the well-being of 
others and the maintenance of juridical order. This is because, 
to the extent that a person who has consumed drugs acts under 
the influence of a substance that prevents him from being fully 
aware of the reality around him, he is capable of causing 
enormous harm, even committing crimes, which obviously would 
threaten public interest, harm society, and should therefore be 
penalized. 
  [Vargas] Thank you, Dr. Jose Gregorio. We should point out 
that this is the most significant and controversial decision the 
Constitutional Court has made. We must remember that the vote 
was 5-4 among the justices who decided to decriminalize personal 
drug use. The dissenting justices say this will have serious 
international repercussions as far as Colombia's image in the 
fight against drug trafficking is concerned. This will create 
grave legal problems because it opens the doors to the definite 
legalization of drug trafficking and will create serious 
psychiatric and psychological problems among the youths who 
consume these substances.

whether to accept or reject the legalization of drugs. Jorge 
Enrique Botero has the story: 
  [Begin recording] [Gaviria] The government is more convinced 
about the possibility of holding a plebiscite. 
  [Botero] Gaviria unexpectedly commented on the decision by 
the country's highest constitutional organization. 
  [Gaviria] Congress or the people should have discussed, 
analyzed, and voted on a decision such as this one; it should 
not have been a court decision. 
  [Botero] Gaviria said he will seek counsel to initiate the 
plebiscite process. 
  [Gaviria] We will have to decide along with the Electoral 
Tribunal and the National Civil Registry Office when to hold the 
plebiscite. 
  [Botero] The president added it is unlikely the consultation 
will be made during the 29 May presidential elections, but he 
hinted of a possible plebiscite during the runoff elections, 
should they be necessary. [end recording]

center during preparations to counterattack the rebels. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] The counterinsurgency operations of

reported that the insurgents dynamited four facilities, the 
Agrarian Fund, and some banks. So far, one policeman is 
reported dead. This newswoman was unable to reach Gachala 
because, in addition to the rebels' activities, the place is 
isolated as the result of a landslide on the road leading to the 
town. Counterinsurgency reinforcements continue to be 
dispatched to the area by air. The 13th Brigade commander, 
General Norberto Agra, is coordinating operations from Santa Fe

  [Text] Medellin, Colombia, 8 May (AFP) -- This Saturday in 
Medellin following the confiscation of explosives and ammunition 
and the arrest of 12 insurgents, Colombian Army and secret 
police foiled a guerrilla plot to sabotage the approaching 29 
May presidential elections. 
  The Medellin military command gave the details of this 
Sunday's joint operation, which they described as effective, 
against possible sabotage of the electoral process. The command 
also announced the arrest of the leader of the FARC 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] Bolivarian Militia's 
urban group and 11 other rebels. 
  The operation resulted in the seizure of 200 kg of dynamite, 
19 16-caliber cartridges, five rolls of slow-burning fuse, and 
882 9-mm bullets during a raid on a house in northeastern 
Medellin, Colombia's second largest city. 
  Military sources indicated that operations against FARC 
groups in the Medellin urban area are directed at preventing 
disruptions such as those that occurred during the 13 March 
legislative elections. The same sources also reported that 
there was significant property damage but no casualties during 
the March terrorist attacks against political party headquarters 
and the Venezuelan consulate in Medellin. 
  This Sunday, the authorities stressed that they intend to 
continue operations against subversives and explained that the 
arrest of 12 Bolivarian Militia members and the seizure of war 
material followed 90 days of investigations and intelligence 
work.

people have been arrested and 18 clandestine landing strips

communications system. 
  The first communications base was raided north of Cali. The 
Candelaria Limitada brick company was used as a front for the 
operation. The "National Newscast" has learned that alleged 
drug trafficker Diego Montoya Sanchez, alias Don Diego, owns the 
company. The authorities are currently pursuing Montoya. During 
the raid, the authorities located checking accounts, financial 
statements, seven hand-held communications radios, battery 
chargers, and batteries. They also found documents of (Acetel 
Limitada), another communications company, with the 
registrations for 20 hand-held radios and permits from the 
Communications Ministry. The authorities found copies of checks 
for over 500 million pesos. The Joint Special Command raided a 
second company, (Compania Conalviver), also north of Cali. The 
communications center had no permit from the Communications 
Ministry. The command seized four screens, monitors, 
communication radios, and other equipment. According to the 
state's intelligence corps, these communication companies cover 
the entire Valle del Cauca Department and serve as fronts for 
the Cali Cartel to make transactions and contact drug 
traffickers at the service of that cartel.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Carlos Arturo Angel Arango, president of the </F>
National Association of Industrialists, ANDI: "Economic 
Prospects Are Not Clear"] 
  [Text] The main forces driving 
growth are beginning to flag. It will not be easy to achieve 
results similar to those obtained in '93. 
  Last year was a good year for the economy, but the positive 
trend did not extend to all sectors. The foreign trade trend, 
inadequate saving, and declining production profits were the 
sore spots. 
  Nor are prospects for 1994 clear. Not only will the 
aforementioned factors persist, but the main forces driving 
growth are already beginning to flag. That being the case, it 
will not be easy to equal last year's results this year, whether 
in terms of growth, the industrial effort, price trends, or the 
exchange rate. 
  1. Economic growth: According to the DNP [National 
Department 
of Planning], the Colombian economy grew at a rate of 5.16 
percent in 1993. If one excludes coffee, the figure rises to 
6.46 percent. This is unquestionably a good effort, given the 
fact that it is the highest of the past five years. Furthermore, 
it was achieved in a context of low growth rates for the world 
economy and three years into the process of opening up the 
nation's economy. 
  The pattern is uniform if one proceeds by sector. Financial 
and personal services rose over 6 percent, electricity, gas, and 
water by 12.6 percent, and construction by 9.3 percent. 
Agriculture, industry, and mining were below the general average 
(2.7, 1.9, and .1 percent respectively). 
  Measures were recently adopted to restrict credit for the 
purpose of reducing liquidity and forcing a decline in overall 
demand. While this alternative does contribute to the 
anti-inflationary policy, it is disturbing in short-range terms 
that one would opt to limit demand instead of stimulating 
productive activity, given the existing productive capacity. 
  2. Manufacturing industry: According to figures supplied by 
DANE [National Administrative Department of Statistics], growth 
including coffee was 4.1 percent at the close of 1993 and 6.03 
percent without it. The trend was not uniform throughout all 
sectors, however. In fact, roughly 44 percent of our industrial 
production, which generates 36 percent of all manufacturing 
jobs, is currently at a standstill or deteriorating. It is 
important to stress the extraordinary effort of the equipment 
and transport sector (45.9 percent), which was largely 
responsible for driving industrial growth. If we exclude this 
sector from the total including coffee, growth falls from 4.11 
to a fairly unsatisfactory 1.8 percent. Nor did sectors linked 
to construction activity have a strong showing. 
  In 1993, problems of profitability arose related to the 
process of opening up the market. On the one hand, sectors that 
ship a large share of their production to the foreign market 
were affected by the slow rate of devaluation. 
  On the other hand, other sectors that focus more on the 
domestic market face competition from imports, both legal and 
illegal, competition that has prevented them from adjusting 
their prices based on cost trends. This is the case of tobacco, 
paper, rubber and rubber products, chemical substances, and 
professional and scientific equipment. Industry's prospects for 
1994 are uncertain, although there is good reason to be 
optimistic about certain sectors. In its Macroeconomic Plan, the 
DNP predicts growth of 4 to 4.5 percent in the industrial GDP, 
explained by the increase in the amount of capital accumulated 
and expansion in overall demand. 
  Factors that may stimulate industrial activity include the 
following: the foreseeable recovery of the world economy; 
moderation of inflationary trends; investments in development of 
the hydrocarbon sector; the vigor of public spending; growth in 
the construction industry, although at a slower rate than in the 
past; the anticipated expansion of regional markets as a result 
of integration; improved competitiveness resulting from 
decisions to convert and modernize production; and the 
availability of credit. 
  The uncertainty in question results from: rising production 
costs associated with social security; the drop in real wages 
and increasing difficulties faced by regional economies, 
particularly Venezuela; the expectation of a larger revaluation; 
the persistent replacement of national production by imports; 
and the declining vigor of the automotive sector. 
  3. Inflation: One has to recognize that the current 
administration managed to check the upward trend of prices since 
the latter half of the 1980's. Industrial prices have 
demonstrated behavior consistent with the goal of reducing 
inflation. This situation is in contrast with the evolution in 
goods and services provided by the government, which have stayed 
at a level far above the general average. The reduction in the 
general level of prices was achieved at the expense of 
agriculture. 
  For 1994, the government has proposed consumer inflation of 
around 19 percent. While this is a desirable goal, one does 
perceive any number of factors that could compromise its 
achievement. Topping the list is the fact that the agricultural 
sector will not continue to make a significant contribution to 
any reduction in the general level of prices. It is a fact to be 
taken into account when one considers that without the 
agricultural sector, the consumer price index has fluctuated 
about 25 percent over the past two years. At the same time, 
fiscal management and the control of those prices which the 
government does regulate will be fundamental if the goal is to 
be achieved. In this connection, one must recognize the 
government's commitment to adjusting rates to the anticipated 
rate of inflation. 
  In other words, the major responsibility for meeting the 
goal 
of inflation set clearly falls on the government's shoulders. 
This is particularly so when one considers the fact that in 
industry and agriculture as well, the margin left for raising 
prices has been cut, among other reasons, by exposure to foreign 
competition.

<F P=106> [Article by Hector Hernandez M.: "'94-'98: A More Open </F>
Market, But Implemented Better"] 
  [Text] The main business associations intend to tell the 
new president what our development priorities for the immediate 
future must be. The revaluation and lack of innovation are their 
main concerns. 
  Our country's best development option is to open the market, 
but major adjustments will have to be made by the next 
government, particularly in terms of implementation. 
  If we are to battle crime and guerrilla-backed violence, we 
shall not only be forced to consolidate justice, but to 
strengthen the government's ability to maintain law and order. 
Nor can the possibility of negotiating with armed groups be 
ruled out. 
  This the view which the country's main business associations 
take of national development priorities in the years lying 
ahead. By June of this year, the National Council of 
Associations (CNG) will have finished drafting a program 
containing proposals to be presented to the next president-elect 
on how to handle the country's economic, political, and social 
issues. 
  The DIARIO ECONOMICO obtained a copy of the second draft of 
the associations' program. In it, they express great concern 
over the process of revaluing the peso, a process that "may be 
stepped up in the future." 
  The associations believe that it is important for the 
government to intervene in markets, but solely for the purpose 
of correcting distortions. However, with respect to 
technological innovation and social management, they hint that 
it should take more direct action than it has heretofore done. 
  The program says that in the future, it will be of exceeding 
importance to use concerted action as a tool to consolidate 
democracy. It announces that business associations will 
participate in the various legally constituted councils and 
commissions in order to reach agreement with the government on 
such issues as maintaining high rates of growth and employment, 
lowering inflation, and achieving better planning. 
<H5>  Better Execution </H5>
  "In the debate on the future role of the Colombian 
Government 
and its priorities, rather than questioning its active role in 
areas such as infrastructure, education, science and technology, 
law enforcement, the adoption of market reforms, and the need to 
give top priority to reaching the poorest population groups, it 
would be more appropriate to question how this redefinition of 
the method and field of government action has been expressed in 
practical terms," one draft says. 
  Concerning the new system of overall social security, it 
states that an attempt must be made to apply it "as a key policy 
in order to provide stability for the model of development." 
  It admits that while so-called social spending as a 
proportion of the gross domestic product has gradually begun to 
climb again in the 1990's, "it is still below levels reached in 
the mid '80's and remains far below national needs." 
  This and other problems remain unsolved: inadequate 
execution 
of the budget and weak, uncoordinated social institutions, 
combined with a lack of coherent medium- and long-term programs. 
  With respect to how the exchange rate is to be handled, the 
production associations say, "it has been observed that because 
of its constitutional mandate to oversee the purchasing power of 
the currency, the new monetary authority (the board of directors 
of the Bank of the Republic) is not in a position to impede this 
process affecting the behavior of the production of salable 
goods. It will have to take an in-depth look at future trends of 
the macroeconomic variables having the greatest impact on the 
price of the currency and propose policies preventing any spread 
of the so-called "Dutch disease." 
  They agree that because of problems besetting agriculture 
such as climatic changes and sudden variations in foreign prices 
for agricultural products, subsidies must be instituted for the 
sector, but of a type that will not "weaken the ability to 
compete with other related activities, if one wants to avoid the 
cost of extending protection to the rest of the productive 
system." 
  The draft exhibits a tendency to give priority to the 
conservation of natural resources over their indiscriminate 
exploitation aimed at improving the economic situation. 
  "If it is to be consolidated in long-range terms, the new 
model of development will require policies making it 
sustainable. There is increasing awareness of the need to face 
up to the depletion of natural resources, put a stop to alarming 
pollution, and adopt a different type of urban development that 
will halt the decline in the quality of life in our cities and 
make it possible to accommodate the projected population 
increase without undue trauma." 
<H5>  Justice, Lack of Safety, and Violence </H5>
  In order to face the challenge of violence and crime, the 
National Council of Business Associations maintains that not 
only will it be necessary to consolidate justice as democracy's 
instrument par excellence for solving social conflicts, but also 
to strengthen the government's ability to maintain law and 
order. "Colombia is one of the most violent countries in the 
world and has in recent years been forced to face a resurgence 
of what experts call "organized violence," which is linked to 
guerrilla movements, drug trafficking, and organized crime." 
  The various methods "will therefore require complex 
solutions 
in terms of their options, including a possible attempt on the 
part of the government to engage in negotiations that might lead 
armed groups to disarm." 
  "In terms of daily violence," the document says, "in 
addition 
to strengthening the police, we must undertake more complex 
action aimed at countering its causes, which include a lack of 
flexible legal means to resolve conflicts, weapons possession, 
the use of alcohol and drugs, inadequate monitoring of the 
conduct of administrative officials, and the lack of educational 
and recreational facilities." 
  Finally, the business associations are not attacking the 
Gaviria government, but rather, trying to project their own 
model into the future.

  [Text] The Human Rights Coordinating Board has requested 
that the Red Cross Organization verify reports of alleged 
murders in the area where the Army is attacking the so-called 
"Popular Guerrilla Army," the armed branch of the Shining Path 
[SL], which is comprised of some 250 men armed with North Korean 
AKM rifles. 
  The Human Rights Coordinating Board, however, disclosed 
information according to which Army troops had allegedly 
murdered innocent people with no clash having taken place, but 
Rosa Mujica, board president, admitted that they lack 
information on the exact number of victims. The Coordinating 
Board nevertheless demanded that the military offensive be 
suspended. 
  EXPRESO yesterday interviewed Ernesto de La Jara, president 
of the Institute for Legal Defense, who went to the zone where 
the alleged massacre took place. 
  [EXPRESO] What did you see? 
  [De La Jara] I spoke to many locals. Even we were surprised. 
An incredible number of civilians have been massacred in a zone 
where there are no Shining Path members. We received the direct 
testimony of terrified people, who had managed to get away after 
many days. I have no political interest. We couldn't believe 
what they told us, we couldn't understand why this had happened. 
  [EXPRESO] Do you mean to say that the SL is not in that 
area? 
  [De La Jara] The SL is not in the zone where these people 
were massacred, that is, on the left margin of the Huallaga 
River, in front of Anda and Aucayacu, in the villages of Moena 
and Moyuna. The SL is further inland. The people are terrified 
of the SL. They want them to be completely wiped out. They 
say: "Go in and kill the SL members, but not us." Many people 
do not even belong to the zone; they come for the harvest season 
and leave. 
  [EXPRESO] Why would the Army attack a zone where there are 
no 
SL members? 
  [De La Jara] The head of the political-military front 
believes that all the people of that zone belong to the SL, 
because the SL has been through there many times. It is as if 
businessmen who have paid protection fees were members of the 
SL. We are talking about humble people with no resources... 
  [EXPRESO] Where have you been? 
  [De La Jara] We tried to enter the zone, but were not 
allowed 
to do so. But a priest, Father Gilberto Hume, did... 
  [EXPRESO] But who warned you? 
  [De La Jara] The people of the zone who managed to get away 
and come to Lima, people from the church. The bishop of 
Artales, Huanuco, has agreed to go now... 
  [EXPRESO] Don't you think the SL itself got you to go to the 
zone? 
  [De La Jara] The SL has been defeated; it is not capable of 
that. It is a matter of going to the zone to see and hear what 
the people have to say. Several witnesses have talked about 40 
or 50 people. Others say more... 
  [EXPRESO] But there might be SL members, there might have 
been a battle. 
  [De La Jara] But there have been no clashes... 
  [EXPRESO] How do you know? 
  [De La Jara] The witnesses, the peasants said so. They say 
that first they appeared with helicopters and machine guns. 
Later on, Army troops destroyed and burned the huts. Those who 
managed to get away by hiding were the ones who told us what had 
happened. 
  [EXPRESO] But it might have been SL members or people 
handled 
by the SL. 
  [De La Jara] It is a question of seeing and listening to 
them. They are humble people, in tears, terrified. They would 
have to have been very good actors. 
  [EXPRESO] The nucleus of the Popular Guerrilla Army is 
supposed to be there. 
  [De La Jara] Further inland, at a great distance. In a 
completely different zone... 
  [EXPRESO] They might have gone through that zone. What makes 
no sense is that the Army should have gone in to kill just for 
fun. 
  [De La Jara] I repeat, there have been no clashes. They were 
machine-gunned from helicopters. The plan was to kill everyone 
in the zone. We have the testimony of a great number of 
witnesses... Moreover, the way they kill people is atrocious, 
and this was said by several people: They rip babies out of 
pregnant women, they let people bleed to death, autopsies have 
been practiced. We do not even want an investigation. We want 
the operation to end. We have a copy of the testimony before 
the Huanuco prosecutor's office of a woman explaining how they 
killed her husband and eight peasants in front of her, and how 
eight members of the patrol raped her and 10 raped a 13-year-old 
girl. It is terrifying, unexplainable.

  [Text] Tingo Maria, 25 Apr -- General Alfredo Rodriguez 
Riveros, chief of the Huallaga Front, said that the bodies found 
buried in a grave in the Shapingo sector (Moyuna) yesterday by 
members of the Human Rights Commission of the Democratic 
Constituent Congress belong to two Shining Path "commanders" of 
a group that operates in this zone. 
  He said this was determined by the testimony of three 
repented Shining Path members who were under the command of one 
of them, and also from intelligence information. 
  Other military chiefs said the dead were known as "Comrade 
Mardonio" and "Comrade Abel" of the logistical and military 
commands, respectively, of the so-called 3d Batallion of the 
Moena-Moyuno People's Committee. 
  "Comrade Abel" supposedly is peasant Felix Loyola who, 
according to his wife and relatives, was a coca grower who had 
his farm in this sector and was shot by soldiers when he was 
leaving the area. 
  Gen. Rodriguez presumes that the bodies belong to some of 
the 
six terrorists killed by a militay patrol on 8 April in a clash 
in another sector of Moyuna, about three to four hours by foot 
into the jungle. 
  He said that all the information will be given to provincial 
Prosecutor Carlos Gonzalez Ortiz, who is investigating this case 
to gain more evidence to clarify the killings. 
  Regarding the bones found in the Carmen Alto zone (near the 
port of Moyuna de Anda), he said that according to preliminary 
information the bones have been there for several years.

  [Text] Montevideo, 6 May (EFE) -- Uruguay today implemented 
preventive diplomatic action against the possible unilateral 
intervention by the United States in Haiti which, in the opinion 
of Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu, would aggravate an 
already very serious situation in Haiti. 
  During a news conference for foreign journalists, Abreu 
stated that his country opposes any type of unilateral action in 
Haiti, and has called for rapid action by the OAS for an 
in-depth study of the crisis being experienced by the Caribbean 
nation. 
  The meeting that has been called for today in Washington by 
the Permanent Council of the OAS, at the petition of Uruguay, is 
the first concrete action to be carried out after reports were 
disseminated in the U.S. press regarding a possible unilateral 
U.S. military action. 
  Asked about the international community's possible lateness 
in acting against the problem that arose after the coup d'etat 
against constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is 
currently in exile in the United States, Abreu stated that 
Uruguay backs the Governor's Island Agreements that were signed 
in 1993, and does not want the situation to deteriorate. 
  OAS actions will be based on the latest reports and 
proposals 
made by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, whose 
members will once again visit Haiti to determine the seriousness 
of the deterioration of individual rights. 
  The Commission will visit the island between 16 and 20 May, 
and its members will meet with Haitian personalities and 
citizens. 
  The foreign minister stated that his country is promoting 
the 
"political receptiveness to beginning to work more profoundly 
for a diplomacy that attempts to prevent a unilateral armed 
action, which would cause a deterioration in the situation and 
would favor no one." 
  "Uruguay is a jealous defender of nonintervention, and is 
willing to work for and support all leads toward a solution," 
the foreign minister stressed. 
  Abreu acknowledged that up to the present time there has 
been 
no success, but he insisted that "armed unilateral intervention 
is not the solution." 
  The foreign minister reported that he has the support of 
Brazil, Chile, and Bolivia after rapid telephone conversations 
with his colleagues and with the Mexican Embassy to evaluate the 
matter and to prevent a possible unilateral armed intervention. 
  "Our country will support every lead toward a solution that 
is undertaken within the bounds of international law and by 
competent organizations," the minister said. 
  The Uruguayan foreign minister summed up his position by 
indicating that in view of the seriousness of the Haitian crisis 
it is urgent that it be "discussed within an atmosphere of 
preventive diplomacy." 
  "Uruguay does not support individual action, but does 
support 
multilateral action," he stressed. 
  Uruguayan diplomacy indicates that the reactivation of and 
new dimensions for the OAS will be a fundamental step in 
resolving the Haitian crisis. 
  "The principles of nonintervention and self-determination 
are 
not negotiable," the foreign minister insisted, in explaining 
how the work to promote "preventive diplomacy" will be carried 
out.

  [Text] Montevideo, 6 May (EFE) -- Foreign Minister Sergio 
Abreu has confirmed to foreign correspondents that his country's 
stance on Mercosur [Common Market of the South] is to 
consolidate it. He nonetheless conceded that "as in any 
integration process, the road is paved with difficulties." 
  He moreover pointed out that with regard to the 
controversial 
issue of duty free zones, his country "will neither change its 
position nor make any concessions, because the private sector -- 
the one that invests there -- needs clear and predictable rules 
of the game." Besides, he contended that it has been "proven" 
that for Uruguay "it is a very useful tool for achieving 
development." 
  Abreu denied that Uruguay will withdraw from negotiations 
over the common external tariff. Nevertheless, he acknowledged 
that one or two officials might have voiced their personal 
opinions, which do not reflect the government's official 
position. The government never "as an institution entertained 
the idea of leaving Mercosur, or voiced a desire to do so." 
  Abreu's remarks were made during a news conference, 
following 
the release of press reports on 5 May which, citing government 
officials, indicated that Uruguay had decided to withdraw from 
negotiations until Brazil had explained its proposal to 
establish a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA). 
  The foreign minister stated that "to date, Uruguay's 
strategy 
and position are clearly known to be in favor of the 
consolidation of Mercosur in all its manifestations." He 
explained that these consist of "the enhancement of free trade 
zones, which will have been concluded by the end of the year 
with the exception of the Treaty of Asuncion for Uruguay and 
Paraguay, and the definition of the common external tariff." 
  Abreu added that this will not necessarily entail 
establishing a customs union, "which needs other instruments for 
its creation, such as the system of origin, clear rules and 
regulations on exceptions in foreign trade, and also aspects 
that have to do with the settlement of controversies." He 
underlined that the countries are undertaking "a gradual process 
in a negotiation that is by no means easy." 
  The foreign minister reported that there is consensus 
between 
the four Mercosur partners -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay -- on 85 percent of the subjects pertaining to the 
common external tariff. Despite this, he noted that three major 
sectors "that are very sensitive to the two more developed 
economies, Brazil and Argentina, namely capital goods, the 
petrochemical industry, and computer science," are still pending. 
  Abreu said that Uruguay, like the other member countries, is 
studying the Brazilian proposal for creating SAFTA, which has to 
be improved to make it compatible with Mercosur's political 
projects and with the other integration endeavors. 
  Abreu believes that SAFTA "is Brazil's absolutely 
understandable reaction to NAFTA" in defense of South American 
trade. 
  Insisting on defending tax-free zones, the minister said 
that 
once the common external tariff is set "we will know what type 
of integration we want and what type of protection from third 
countries we will have." 
  Abreu considered the common external tariff to be "of prime 
importance, and it will affect the free zones, which Uruguay 
will not change." 
  The minister pointed out that the economies of some regions 
of the country need to be bolstered, and duty free zones are an 
appropriate means for doing so. 
  Brazil and Argentina have not accepted Uruguay's system of 
free zones, even though Abreu said that "there are different 
opinions" on it, though no "major opposition."

<F P=106> [Bulletin No. 2 issued by the Electoral Tribunal [TE] at the </F>
Atlapa Convention Center in Panama City; read by TE Press 
Secretary Doris Chong Guardia -- live] 
  [Text] Today, Sunday, 8 May, the National Vote-Counting 
Board will be installed at 1400 at the Atlapa Convention Center. 
  On 50th Street, a car carrying former Costa Rican President 
Rodrigo Carazo Odio collided with another vehicle, but there 
were no serious problems for the distinguished guest who has 
been invited here by the Electoral Tribunal [TE] as an observer. 
Carazo later met with ex-U.S. President Jimmy Carter. 
  In Bocas del Toro, a TE source reported that the process is 
proceeding smoothly at the province's 211 voting sites. This is 
one of the few provinces where there are no independent 
candidates. 
  As for Cocle Province, it has been reported that a phone 
call 
warning that a bomb had been planted was received at the 
Dominican Republic School voting site. The incident was handled 
by the Police Investigations Department, the Public Force, and 
the National Civil Protection System. The area was evacuated 
for 30 minutes. It was confirmed that the call had been a false 
alarm. In Colon, the 346 voting sites opened normally. Nothing 
unusual has happened in the province. 
  Our correspondent in Chiriqui reports that the voting is 
going smoothly and that the people are displaying a great sense 
of civic responsibility. In David, electoral officials 
penalized certain businesses which, in violation of the law, 
sold alcoholic beverages. Everything is normal in Herrera 
Province, it was reported at noon. A large voter turnout is 
reported in Los Santos Province. 
  In Panama Province, voters went to the voting sites in an 
orderly manner, particularly in metropolitan Panama. In Canita 
de Chepo, a candidate for representative was detained when he 
was caught with electoral material in a state-owned vehicle. 
The candidate also verbally abused the electoral official who 
questioned him. The vehicle was confiscated. Voting sites 1832 
and 1833 in Rio Iglesias opened to voters at 1300 after damaged 
ballots for corregimiento representatives were replaced. 
  The general consensus, at least in Panama City, is that the 
doubts on the use of the single ballot have been dispelled. The 
ballot is being used with no problem.

<F P=106> [Bulletin No. 3 issued by the Electoral Tribunal, TE, at the </F>
Atlapa Convention Center in Panama City; read by TE Press 
Secretary Doris Chong Guardia -- live] 
  [Text] The voting process in Bocas del Toro Province has 
ended, and everything is in order. As the voting process ended 
in Los Santos Province, we learned that the elections were held 
amid a peaceful atmosphere; however, minor incidents occurred 
and were quickly resolved. Several political party 
representatives, who arrived at the voting centers to cast their 
votes as they were closing, complained in Chitre, Ocu, and 
Parita Districts. They began complaining when voting table 
authorities enforced the guidelines for such cases. Due to 
technical problems at the relay station and despite great 
efforts made to reestablish communication lines with the San 
Blas Indian Reservation, we were unable to obtain details about 
the final phase of the voting process in this Indian region. 
  Meanwhile, in Darien Province, along the Colombian border, 
it 
was reported that the end of the voting process went smoothly, 
despite a six-hour delay at two voting tables in Rio Iglesias. 
This problem was solved, and lost time was recovered. In 
Cocle, it was reported that the voting process went as planned, 
but a couple of vote-buying incidents took place in Cabuya 
hamlet. The Anton municipal attorney is handling the 
investigations. There was a shortage of 20 presidential ballots 
at a voting table in Salineta de Nata, but Electoral Tribunal 
[TE] officials immediately supplied them. 
  Meanwhile, the Electoral District Vote-Counting Boards were 
set up at 1400 in Chiriqui Province, and the wait for the end of 
the elections began. Now that voters have finished voting, 
these electoral organizations have started performing their 
duties. 
  Most international observers invited by the TE came back 
from 
their tours of the many electoral posts in the countryside and 
concluded their observations in the metropolitan area, where 
they witnessed the end of the electoral process at several 
voting tables. 
  As we conclude this third bulletin, we inform the media that 
from now on the flow of information is in the hands of the TE 
information system, as announced by the honorable TE 
magistrates. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Electoral Tribunal, TE, from the </F>
Atlapa Conventions Center in Panama City; read by TE President 
Eduardo Valdes Escoffery; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] ...cast in the presidential elections, with only 
32,842 or 3 percent of the votes annulled. In other words, a 
turnout was 73.82 percent and the abstention rate was 26.10 
percent. 
  From the time the first results were issued representing 
only 
11.8 percent of the voting tables, the figures have always 
favored candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares of the United People 
alliance. 
  Here are the latest figures available: Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, 33.19 percent; Mireya Moscoso de Gruber [Democratic 
Alliance], 28.86 percent; Ruben Blades [Papa Egoro Movement], 
17.56 percent; Ruben Carles [Change 94], 16.36 percent; Eduardo 
Vallarino [Christian Democratic Party], 2.15 percent; Samuel 
Lewis Galindo [National Accord Alliance], 1.57 percent; and Jose 
Salvador Munoz [Doctrinaire Panamenist Party], 0.32 percent. 
  The Electoral Tribunal must clarify that according to the 
law, the National Vote-Counting Board must proclaim the official 
results of the 8 May 1994 elections for president and vice 
presidents of the Republic. Only 15 hours after the elections 
and the closure of the polls, we have managed to unofficially 
announce almost 90 percent of the results, which is 
unprecedented in the history of Panamanian elections. 
  At this time, the TE's main office declares a recess until 
1400 while the computer personnel continue to register the 
results as they are received from the 547 tables that have not 
yet been counted. 
  Issued in Panama City on 9 May 1994. 
  Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Lombana, president of the Panamanian </F>
National Vote-Counting Board, by Ciro Ortega and Alexandra 
Ciniglio at the Atlapa Convention Center in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] [Ortega] There has been word of a recess; what does 
this mean? 
  [Lombana] Good evening. We had called for a meeting at 2300 
today [0400 GMT 9 May], thinking that by then we would have 
figures for the first circuit -- namely 8-7 -- per Electoral 
Tribunal plans. Apparently there has been some delay in the 
electoral district vote count, and it is believed that it will 
be 0100 [0600 GMT 9 May] before it is ready. This means the 
National Vote-Counting Board has again gone into recess until 
that time. Likewise, we have reports that 8-8 and 8-9 will 
arrive about one hour after 8-7 is received. In other words, we 
have enough work for all the predawn hours. 
  [Ciniglio] Can you explain the difference between the work 
of 
the National Vote-Counting Board and the work in the press room 
with the unofficial results? 
  [Lombana] It is important to point out that the unofficial 
results released by the Electoral Tribunal, as the word 
indicates, are unofficial results. We, at the National 
Vote-Counting Board will receive the vote tally sheets covering 
the 40 electoral districts, which collect the results of the 
5,310 voting tables throughout the country. In the presence of 
and together with political party representatives to the 
National Vote-Counting Board, we will count and certify that 
what the vote tally sheets say agrees with what the voting 
tables received. 
  [Ciniglio] In view of the delay, when do you think the 
National Vote-Counting Board will proclaim the next president of 
the Republic? 
  [Lombana] We continue with our plan of four to six days. In 
other words, we hope to do our duty by Thursday or Friday.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Guillermo Endara by Dorita de </F>
Reyna at the Presidential Palace in Panama City on 8 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Reyna] Good afternoon, Mr. President. How do you 
feel today? 
  [Endara] I must say I am happy and proud to be a Panamanian. 
I am happy because when I went out to vote, I saw in the faces 
of the Panamanian people the same pride I felt. People feel 
proud of their democracy and freedom. That makes me very happy 
as president and as a Panamanian citizen. 
  [Reyna] What institutions do you think helped you in your 
democratic work? 
  [Endara] Many. I must mention the Public Force, in 
particular the National Police. Five years ago, this body was 
an Army with military training. Today, the police are 
performing their duties by helping voters cast their votes and 
preserve order. The Supreme Court of Justice has played a very 
important role, not just because it has remained independent of 
the executive branch. Not only that, when the executive branch 
overstepped its duties regarding rights -- thank God, it did 
very few times -- the Court ruled against us and we abided by 
its decision immediately because we know this Court is very 
responsible. I must also thank the Legislative Assembly. 
Although I do not enjoy a majority there, it has supported me 
when fundamental proposals, such as the Electoral Code, have 
been presented. In general, I must thank government and 
opposition parties because they handled the campaign very well 
and enjoyed democracy. 
  [Reyna] What advice would you give the candidate who comes 
out the winner, after all of the votes in the ballot boxes are 
counted? 
  [Endara] To protect these democratic institutions we have 
put 
to work during this brief period of time, he should protect and 
preserve them so they can mature. It would be criminal to let 
something so beautiful be ruined. I would say this should be 
the primary concern. 
  [Reyna] Mr. President, a message for the 18 countries of the 
continent of America who are watching us through Cadena Sur? 
  [Endara] I thank all Latin American friendly countries for 
the support they have given Panama in its struggle for democracy 
and freedom. We have always appreciated this support. We expect 
them to continue supporting us now that we live in freedom and 
democracy so this democratic experiment can continue and we can 
live in a free, democratic America.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Lombana, president of the National </F>
Vote-Counting Board, by Octavio Cogley at the ATLAPA Convention 
Center Election Media Center in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] [Cogley] In a few minutes, the National 
Vote-Counting Board will be installed right here in La Huaca 
Hall of the ATLAPA Convention Center. We are here with Mr. 
Roberto Alfredo Lombana, with whom we will be speaking about 
what is going to take place with the National Vote-Counting 
Board. Mr. Roberto Alfredo Lombana, this afternoon, in just a 
few minutes, the National Vote-Counting Board will be installed. 
The representatives of each of the political parties are 
already beginning to arrive. What will the board's main duty 
be? Basically, what is the National Vote-Counting Board 
responsible for? 
  [Lombana] Of course. The National Vote-Counting Board is an 
autonomous body appointed by the Electoral Tribunal [TE] and 
made up of representatives of the 15 political parties 
participating in the election process. Our responsibility lies 
in counting the 40 electoral districts covering the total number 
of votes of the 5,310 voting tables located throughout the 
country and to proclaim the president of the Republic. 
  [Cogley] With respect to the vote count, when precisely will 
the process begin? 
  [Lombana] If the TE continues on schedule as it has been 
operating thus far, we will be receiving the first circuit vote 
tally sheets at 2300 [0400 GMT on 9 May]. At that time we will 
also start receiving the other vote tally sheets. We expect 
that in four or five days we will proclaim the election winner. 
  [Cogley] How does the National Vote-Counting Board assess 
the 
work done by the TE? 
  [Lombana] It has been quite positive. We have received 
excellent support from the TE and they have helped us to 
organize this event to such an extent that today, at 1400 this 
afternoon, we will begin operations. 
  [Cogley] What can you say about the populations' 
participation? 
  [Lombana] I believe that we are not only witnessing 
admirable 
participation by the presidential candidates, but also from the 
population in general. The mood has been quite festive. 
  [Cogley] Thank you very much Mr. Roberto Lombana for your 
statements to Telemetro Panama.

<F P=106> [Interview with Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes </F>
Escoffery and Electoral Delegate President Juan Francisco de la 
Guardia by Octavio Cogley at the ATLAPA Convention Center 
Election Media Center in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] [Cogley] We are here with Electoral Tribunal [TE] 
President Mr. Eduardo Valdes Escoffery and also Electoral 
Delegate President Juan Francisco de la Guardia. Welcome 
gentlemen. We are witnessing the conclusion of the voting phase 
of the election process. I understand that only those voters 
who were in line when the voting process ended and those members 
of the various boards related to the election process will be 
allowed to vote from here on. Let us listen to Magistrate 
Valdes Escoffery comments on the significance of these 
elections, in which we have been able to witness that the 
Panamanian people have conducted themselves very peacefully, and 
that the elections so far have proceeded very normally. 
  [Valdes] Well, first of all, as Panamanians, we are really 
delighted with the degree of patience, tolerance, aptitude, and 
ability to fraternize with each other that the political 
adversaries have demonstrated. We have seen all of them in 
action. They have all been very cooperative. Men, women, even 
the children who had their own special elections. Even they had 
long lines at their respective voting centers. Incredibly, even 
senior citizens went to vote and where patient enough when their 
voting tables were not located on a ground floor. Some of these 
senior citizens even went to vote with their walkers. 
  Practically, no one has complained about the organization. 
We have received numerous congratulations. The mood has been 
festive and everyone has shared in this mood. This really has 
no precedence. We were just commenting that we would be waking 
up in a different country. I believe that we all feel the same. 
We must all feel quite delighted. Let us hope that those 
limited defects that took place in some areas were finally 
overcome and we will be able to implement whatever corrective 
measures the law specifies in a civilized manner as occurs in 
every election process. 
  I have been able to participate in numerous elections during 
the past year since we are currently undergoing a wave of 
democratic renovation. Even in Chile, a country with a very 
long cultural tradition, I was at a voting center where the 
voting table could open because the party poll representatives 
had not shown up. In Chile, party poll representatives hold 
their positions for a fixed period, and they had just had a 
turnover and the new representatives were not familiar with 
their responsibilities, and they were just discussing how to 
operate the voting table. In other words, every election 
process has some confusion. Let us hope that what we have all 
seen and shared today can be understood in the tolerant manner 
we have demonstrated so far. 
  [Cogley] Mr. Juan Francisco de la Guardia, do you agree with 
the statements by the TE magistrate? Has everything proceeded 
normally? Have there been any problems? You were responsible 
for coordinating everything related to the electoral delegates. 
In addition to that, you were also involved in supervising that 
the election process would proceed normally. 
  [De la Guardia] Not only has it proceeded normally, it has 
also been an extraordinary example of civic conscience by the 
Panamanian people. It was really amazing how the people showed 
up to vote beginning very early in the morning. The voting 
centers were crowded beginning at 0630 and 0700. It was 
incredible how the people went to their respective voting 
centers and how great was their desire to cast their votes. 
They were eager to express their opinion through their votes. 
This is the way we have always wanted it to be in our country. 
We have had an election festival. 
  [Cogley] Well, Mr. Magistrate President, thank you very much 
for your comments.

<F P=106> [Interview with Victor Borge, member of the Borge y </F>
Asociados Company, by Dorita de Reyna at the Telemetro Studios 
in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] [Reyna] After hearing the statement by the 
magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal [TE], Telemetro Television 
contracted the services of the Borge y Asociados company, which 
conducted an exit poll for us. We must clarify that these are 
simply projected figures. Mr. Victor Borge, could you tell us 
what an exit poll is? 
  [Borge] All day long we have conducted a poll at more than 
120 locations throughout the Republic. We have asked people who 
are leaving the premises after casting their vote who they voted 
for. The data collected has been sent via telephone and fax to 
our computer center, where it has been processed. This is the 
first projection of how people were voting all day long. 
  [Reyna] Throughout the entire country? 
  [Borge] Yes, throughout the country. 
  [Reyna] Would you then give us the results of your poll? 
  [Borge] Yes. Let's take a look at the graphs. According to 
this poll, candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party [PRD] is in the lead with 37.8 percent of 
the votes. Second place is close between Ruben Blades of the 
Papa Egoro Party, who has 23.4 percent, and Mrs. Mireya Moscoso 
de Gruber of the Arnulfista Party, with 22.4 percent of the 
votes. Next in line is Ruben Dario Carles, with 11.2 percent of 
the votes. 
  These figures have an error margin of plus or minus 3 
percent, so we cannot be certain whether Mr. Blades or Mrs. 
Moscoso de Gruber is in second place.

<F P=106> [Announcement by Panamanian Electoral Tribunal President </F>
Eduardo Valdes Escoffery from the Atlapa Convention Center in 
Panama City; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] ...beginning [words indistinct] this afternoon 
polling firms are authorized to release the results of the polls 
they conducted today, but obeying Decree No. 27 dated 12 April 
and Decree No. 40 dated 29 April 1994. Regardless of this, the 
Electoral Tribunal [TE] has the duty to caution citizens that 
these polls are based on approximations, which in turn are based 
on questions answered by citizens who voted and who have varying 
degrees of credibility. Even though the polls themselves may 
have been conducted with rigid scientific parameters, these are 
nevertheless only polls and are not based on true events. 
  Because of this, all polls have a margin of error, therefore 
there is no room for claiming victory. We also wish to caution 
that once this information is shared with the people, no person 
who may be favored by these polls may violate the TE's provision 
that states that all demonstrations, gatherings, and caravans 
are totally and absolutely forbidden, according to the law, 
until 1200 on Monday, 9 May 1994. 
  We reiterate it is absolutely essential that no one should 
celebrate any sort of triumph, because other groups could do the 
same and clashes between these groups could endanger the peace 
we have enjoyed all day long. Only the results released by the 
TE, which will be based on true election results from the voting 
tables and only the National Vote-Counting Board can, according 
to the law, release final and definitive official results. 
  The TE takes this opportunity to reiterate to the citizens 
its pledge to issue authentic and unquestionable results 
regarding the national elections held today, 8 May 1994. Many 
thanks.

<F P=106> [News conference by Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential </F>
candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, with 
unidentified reporters at the PRD campaign headquarters in 
Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] [Perez Balladares] Fellow citizens: According to the 
Electoral Tribunal's [TE] figures at 2243 this evening, 52.32 
percent of the polling tables have been tallied. This yields a 
total of 613,017 votes. A trend has prevailed since the tally 
began, and it has not changed. It signifies that we have won 
the 1994 elections. [crowd applauds, chants: "Toro!"] 
  The TE's figures coincide very well with our party's own 
figures. A large number of votes have yet to be tallied in 
Panama Province, where the advantage in our favor is greater, so 
all the analysts -- both ours and independent ones -- accept 
this trend is irreversible and, consequently, the winner is 
yours truly. [applause] Thank you. 
  I do not want to extend the wait any longer. I want to thank 
all the Panamanian people -- those who voted for me, of course, 
and those who opposed us, too -- for their civic-mindedness and 
for the behavior we observed throughout the campaign and today 
on election day. We now begin, as we have said, to build, 
united, without differences or political disputes, the nation's 
future, for the youth and the children. 
  Thank you, Panamanian people, for extraordinary and 
exemplary 
civic behavior. [applause] I also want in particular to thank 
the whole United People campaign team for work and deeds that 
seemed like a dream five years ago. We are determined to 
recover our national dignity, and we are doing it -- with your 
support, in the first place, and the support of all the 
Panamanian people. 
  We now begin a different phase. The elections are over 
today; electoral politics are over today. We now begin a phase 
that demands the best from all Panamanians to achieve what is 
still our goal: a free, independent, and sovereign country with 
equal opportunities for each and every one of us. Thank you, 
everyone, and we will continue to work, united, for the 21st 
century. Thank you. [crowd applauds, chants: "Toro!"] 
  [Reporter] Any names for cabinet members? 
  [Perez Balladares] No, not yet, 
  [Reporter] How do you feel to be the first president elected 
in this country in free and honest elections in more than three 
decades? 
  [Perez Balladares] Personally, I am extremely proud. I 
accept this victory with a great degree of humility because we 
have received a clear message from the Panamanian people, who 
want to leave the dark days behind, want to look forward with 
optimism, and want all Panamanians to join together to enter 
into what should be Panama's golden decade beginning with our 
government. [applause] 
  [Reporter] Are you ready to [words indistinct]? 
  [Perez Balladares] I do not have the slightest doubt: I am 
accompanied by very capable men and women. But we want to add 
more. We want this to be a truly representative government, a 
government based on an agreement among all Panamanians. 
Together we will be able to achieve this. 
  [Reporter] Are you going to work with [words indistinct] 
parties? 
  [Perez Balladares] We are now going to begin to form a 
government that we can feel proud of, one that will allow all 
Panamanians to feel that they are being worthily represented. 
  [Reporter] Does this mean that you would form your 
government 
with parties that have opposed you? 
  [Perez Balladares] Throughout my campaign I said that I was 
willing and hoping to form a government with the best men and 
women available, regardless of political persuasion, and I am 
now reiterating this following my victory. 
  [Reporter] What about the names in today's extra edition of 
LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA -- can you confirm if any of them are 
going to be members of your cabinet? 
  [Perez Balladares] Not yet, not yet. 
  [Reporter] How can you guarantee that you will be able to 
rule if you will possibly be facing a Legislative Assembly and 
most of the media in the hands of the opposition? 
  [Perez Balladares] I believe that the opposition they put up 
was during the electoral campaign. Now national goals should 
unite us. We now have other things, far more superior things, 
to bring us together. 
  [Reporter] Is it true that you already have received 
telephone calls from the Christian Democratic Party candidate 
and the Solidarity Party candidate? 
  [Perez Balladares] I hope that our opponents -- these two as 
well as the others -- will make their own statement. I would 
rather not say anything. I do want to take advantage of your 
question, however, to give thanks to those six candidates who 
accompanied us in this campaign because I believe that between 
all of us we have managed to, first, set the national goals, and 
then to carry out a campaign as we did -- with a few slip-ups, 
perhaps, but for the most part a high-level campaign. Thanks, 
then, to the presidential candidates. 
  [Reporter] Does your victory also include a majority in the 
Legislative Assembly? 
  [Perez Balladares] It is too early to comment on this. We 
are waiting for the results from the TE. 
  [Reporter] Do you have any idea, though, since you were 
asking your supporters to vote for the entire slate? 
  [Perez Balladares] I understand that our party received the 
most votes in the elections, but it is very difficult -- due to 
the system itself -- to know how many legislators won. 
  [Reporter] President Endara invited you to work with him. He 
is going to give you a status report on the presidency. Are you 
going to accept this invitation? 
  [Perez Balladares] Yes, of course. 
  [Reporter] When do you plan to meet with him? 
  [Perez Balladares] When he invites me to do so. 
  [Reporter] You speak of a policy of a free and sovereign 
country. When one comes to Panama one finds a dollar economy. 
What are you going to change? 
  [Perez Balladares] Sovereignty and the circulation of the 
U.S. dollar are not incompatible. Nowadays the majority of 
Latin American economies are dollarized economies. The only 
difference is that the dollar circulates in Panama as an 
international currency; it could be the dollar or any other 
international currency. Our complete and total sovereignty will 
be assured with the faithful fulfillment of the Torrijos-Carter 
treaties over the next five years. 
  [Reporter] Is this your commitment with the Panamanian 
people? 
  [Perez Balladares] Yes, sir. 
  [Reporter] What are your plans for foreign policy and for 
relations with the United States? 
  [Perez Balladares] I think that in the two cases there will 
be high-level policies, policies of respect in which each 
country will have to fight for its national interests and 
objectives. Sometimes they will be compatible, and sometimes 
they will differ, but there should be a lot of respect and lofty 
attitudes, as is called for in relations between grown-up 
countries and between peoples that share common interests. 
  [Reporter] What type of relationship will you maintain with 
the international financial institutions [IFI's]? 
  [Perez Balladares] The same relationship we have always had. 
I believe that these are necessary relations, and the IFI's 
help many countries to attain development goals that are 
necessary. It is a matter of being able to explain our national 
interests well and to obtain, via negotiations, agreements that 
are in keeping with our national interests. 
  [Reporter] Your opponents still hope that the results of the 
elections might change. 
  [Perez Balladares] I believe everyone will have hopes until 
all the votes are counted. That is why I said that these 
figures are not mine; they are TE figures. I also said that the 
analysts, not only our analysts but the independent analysts as 
well, say that due to the way the vote count is headed, because 
of the trend that it has shown from the very beginning, it is 
practically impossible for the final result to change. 
  [Reporter] How do you think the United States is going to 
react now that many people who were ousted from power thanks to 
the invasion are going to return to power thanks to the votes? 
  [Perez Balladares] Neither the United States nor I have said 
this. You are saying it. The party has returned to power. I 
was not in power during the invasion. Our party is a renovated 
party, as we have said on many occasions. In addition, we are a 
party that on several occasions, in practice, has given clear 
proof of internal democracy; a party that in any event 
represents the victory of democracy in Panama. I do not see how 
the United States can do anything other than applaud this 
democratic victory in Panama. 
  [Reporter] Do you believe militarism is completely ruled out 
in Panama? 
  [Perez Balladares] Yes, sir. There is no military here, nor 
any possibility of returning to any phase of the previous 
militarism. 
  [Reporter] What would you tell General Torrijos at this 
time? 
  [Perez Balladares] We have picked up your flag, kissed it, 
and continued onward. [cheers and applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential </F>
candidate of the Democratic Alliance, by Lyssette Condassin; 
place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Condassin] Dr. Arnulfo Arias [founder of the 
Arnulfist Party] became an immortal personality for Panamanians. 
You, in a certain way, also became a very important personality, 
not only because you are the first woman to compete in the 
[presidential] elections, but because you are perhaps very close 
to becoming the first woman president of the Republic. Dona 
Mireya, as a woman, how do you feel? What can you tell us? 
  [Moscoso] I feel very happy to see that the Panamanian 
people 
have given me support, affection. I have been walking for three 
months and wherever have I walked people have welcomed me with 
plenty of affection. They came out to receive me at their 
doorstep only to shake hands. Some wanted me only to touch 
their children and allow them to shake hands; others wanted me 
to bless them. I have received during these walks so much 
satisfaction from thousands of people. As a woman, this has 
been a challenge for me, but I am very happy with this challenge. 
  [Condassin] If you come to power, what would your first 
action be? 
  [Moscoso] If tonight or tomorrow I am declared president, 
the 
first thing I would do would be to call on all Panamanians, all 
parties, to join forces. My government will be of national 
unity. We want the Panamanian people, after 21 years, to be like 
a family; that we forget the past, the fights; and that this be 
a government of national reconciliation. 
  [Condassin] Well, Mrs. Mireya, we want to ask you just one 
more question because we imagine you are very tired. We want to 
know, did Dr. Arnulfo Arias ever give you any sort of advice on 
perhaps how to rule the country? 
  [Moscoso] [chuckles] Dr. Arias gave me plenty of advice. The 
truth is that he was a marvelous man; he was my best teacher. 
Today we have remembered him very much. I believe that 
wherever Dr. Arias is he must feel very proud of what I have 
done for his party and what I am doing for the people. This is 
work that he was not allowed to complete and I know I will 
complete for him. 
  [Condassin] Did you, while you were his wife, ever imagine 
that you could be president of the Republic of Panama? 
  [Moscoso] Never. He was this country's leader; he was 
president five times, elected by the people's will. I was only 
his companion; I was his wife, but I never thought I would 
attain this position. I am in this position because God has 
placed me on this path, but I never imagined. 
  [Condassin] Dear viewers, Arnulfist Party members have a 
very 
positive attitude. Even though results are still not official, 
these results greatly favor this party, according to the 
Arnulfists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Democratic </F>
Alliance presidential candidate, by journalist Barbara Bloise in 
Panama City; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Bloise] ...figures the Electoral Tribunal [TE] has 
revealed so far and what you have been saying in various 
statements? 
  [Gruber] Yes. We are comparing the figures we continue to 
receive with the figures the TE is giving on television. We see 
we have more or less the same figures, but we still lack many 
figures, above all from the countryside. We only have figures 
from the cities, which is what has been shown. 
  [Bloise] What guarantees do the women, above all, have in 
your government if you win the presidency? 
  [Gruber] Look, as a woman I believe women should be granted 
greater participation, so women would have equal participation 
with the men in my government. I do not want to imply that men 
would not participate, but we would.... [changes thought] We 
will certainly try to make sure that women have a major role in 
my government. They will. 
  [Bloise] The Arnulfist Party has always stood out as a 
nationalist party that is deeply rooted among the people. What 
will be your position concerning a renegotiation of the military 
bases? 
  [Gruber] We have said my government will hold a referendum 
and the Panamanian people will decide whether the military bases 
will remain beyond 1999. If they decide yes, then we will ask 
the United States to renegotiate these bases -- provided the 
United States also wants this. 
  [Bloise] Under what conditions would these negotiations be 
carried out? 
  [Gruber] We would first have to talk with the Americans. 
That is what I can tell you. 
  [Bloise] What will be your government's position regarding 
the foreign debt? 
  [Gruber] We know we have a commitment, and the debt must be 
paid. My government will not say it will not pay. We have this 
commitment, and we will fulfill this commitment, too. 
  [Bloise] How will you feel concerning results.... [changes 
thought] What will be your position concerning the results of 
today's elections? 
  [Gruber] How can I feel? We know the results will be known, 
perhaps in the early morning hours, and we also know the results 
will be in our favor. Therefore, we will feel happy, and we 
feel happy about the support the Panamanian people have given 
us. We have a commitment to the Panamanian people, so we will 
wait for the results. It is only a matter of a few hours. 
Thank you. [Crowd chants "Mireya!"]

<F P=106> [Interview with Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Democratic </F>
Alliance presidential candidate, by unidentified reporters at 
Democratic Alliance headquarters in Panama City on 8 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Moscoso] We have just seen on television the 
results announced by the Electoral Tribunal [TE], but we still 
have to wait for the figures from the National Vote-Counting 
Board. However, I have noticed -- as I mentioned on several 
occasions -- that polarization has occurred between the 
Arnulfista Party [PA] and the Democratic Revolutionary Party 
[PRD]. The data we are seeing tonight confirms this once more. 
The data likewise confirms that the fake polls that were being 
announced were in fact rigged, and that they were aimed at 
building up two candidates. We can see whose figures are very 
low, while the PA figures are competing with the PRD figures. 
  [Reporter] Do you believe the PA is going to win? 
  [Moscoso] Of course we are going to win. 
  [Reporter] If you lose, will you concede defeat? 
  [Moscoso] Pardon me? 
  [Reporter] If the PRD happens to win, will you concede 
defeat? 
  [Moscoso] First, I believe that I am going to win. If such a 
possibility exists, however, what we want is a calm and peaceful 
country. I believe that Panama experienced 21 years of 
uncertainty, so if the PRD wins -- if the TE and the National 
Vote-Counting Board confirm this -- we will recognize its 
victory. 
  [Reporter] The Christian Democratic Party [PDC] candidate 
has 
conceded defeat. 
  [Moscoso] He already has? 
  [Reporter] Yes. 
  [Moscoso] I had not heard that, but I think that it is still 
too early to recognize the victory of another candidate. 
  [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya. If you win the elections, what would 
be your government's number one priority? 
  [Moscoso] I have already said that if an announcement is 
made 
tonight that we have won the elections I will call for national 
reconciliation by all Panamanians, all political parties, 
including the PRD, the good people who are in the PRD too. This 
would be my priority. 
  [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya: According to the figures being 
provided by the TE, the PRD is currently in the lead. On what 
do you base your optimism? How do you plan to take the lead? 
  [Moscoso] There are many votes still left to be counted, 
especially votes from the interior of the Republic, and I am 
leading there, in the interior. 
  [Reporter] There is a forecast of [words indistinct]. 
  [Moscoso] No, not yet. I think that should be left up to the 
TE. 
  [Reporter] The TE maintains its ban on mobilizations and 
demonstrations until the final official returns are in. 
Regarding the activities under way by both the PRD and the PA, 
isn't this a violation of the TE rules? 
  [Moscoso] No. I think they are doing the right thing. If 
results are announced now by anyone other than the TE, it would 
be premature. People would take to the streets. We have to 
wait for the results to be announced by the National 
Vote-Counting Board. If the results that are announced now are 
not the same as those that are going to be announced by the 
National Vote-Counting Board we might find ourselves in a huge 
bind. I think it is best for us to wait. I agree with this. 
  [Reporter] Due to the heated emotions of both PRD and PA 
sympathizers, don't you think this is inadvisable? As the 
evening wears on, people get more keyed up. In the event of a 
defeat, wouldn't these people take to the streets denouncing an 
alleged fraud? 
  [Moscoso] For the first time in many years, we have a TE 
that 
everyone knows is made up of very honorable persons. I believe 
that now in Panama no one is going to scream fraud. We are not 
going to do this. I don't know if the PRD would scream fraud if 
they were to lose. Perhaps so, but there is not going to be a 
fraud. These elections have been clean, honest, and whoever 
wins will be the president of Panama. It is true that right now 
our fellow party members are there, downstairs, but they are 
dancing, they are calm. Instead of taking to the streets, I 
would rather they stay here than go out on the streets late at 
night. That would be dangerous.

<F P=106> [Interview with Juan B. Chevalier, spokesman for Panama's </F>
Arnulfist Party, PA, by an unidentified reporter at PA campaign 
headquarters in Panama City on 8 May--recorded] 
  [Text] [Chevalier] I believe Balladares' recent 
announcement proclaiming victory is a bit premature, because to 
announce victory with merely half the votes counted is somewhat 
hasty. I believe there are still half of the votes left to be 
counted. A runner can still get tired halfway through the race. 
  [Reporter] What can you say about the vote count, which is 
taking place at the Atlapa Convention Center? 
  [Chevalier] I believe the election has been a demonstration 
of true democracy. The people have voted freely and elected the 
winner, but we still do not know who the winner is. 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion on the election process? 
  [Chevalier] It is an irreproachable process. Panama has 
given the world an example of how an election process should be 
carried out. The people have voted with a civic spirit, and 
their decision has been respected so far. 
  [Reporter] Do you believe the PA will triumph in these 
elections? 
  [Chevalier] What's that? 
  [Reporter] Do you believe the PA will emerge the winner in 
these elections? 
  [Chevalier] Of course. I have always said the elections were 
between this country's two largest parties. I have always 
maintained that the struggle was between the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] and the PA. Certain sectors went around 
talking about other candidates who I personally believe should 
not have participated in the elections. The results so far have 
proven me right.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Such as which candidates? 
  [Chevalier] You know perfectly well to whom I am referring. 
Please do not ask me foolish questions. [laughs] 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] ...a reconciliation? 
  [Chevalier] I do not believe.... [pauses] I have always said 
we can be adversaries but not enemies; these are two different 
concepts. 
  [Reporter] Don't you believe that with the two parties 
claiming victory this could lead to violence and intolerance? 
  [Chevalier] I do not believe this could be the case, because 
we are all willing to accept the final verdict, but the votes 
must first be counted. I believe it is a bit hasty to proclaim 
victory in the middle of the race. That is all I wanted to say, 
and I reiterate it. I believe it is a bit hasty; moreover, the 
Electoral Tribunal has been stating that candidates should not 
make victory statements and that they should wait until the 
National Vote- Counting Board announces who won; therefore, to 
claim victory halfway through the vote count is comparable to 
making excuses beforehand.

<F P=106> [News conference by Ruben Blades, presidential candidate of </F>
the Papa Egoro Movement, with unidentified reporters at the 
Seaside View restaurant in Panama City -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Blades] I thank everyone for their presence 
here. I think the best way to handle this conference is by my 
answering questions. 
  [Reporter] Your opinion of the Electoral Tribunal's first 
results? 
  [Blades] Although the Electoral Tribunal's results, which 
place us in third, are preliminary, we have no reason to doubt 
the figures. 
  [Reporter] How do you correlate this report with the opinion 
poll results released a few days ago? 
  [Blades] We have always said that we had a job to do 
regardless of the results of the polls. Let us wait until the 
final results are released. 
  [Reporter] Do you still have the faith you had spoken about? 
  [Blades] I will tell you something. We have been ranked 
third. But in relation to whom? Two groups with tremendous 
general experience. They are people with great resources and 
experience in and from government offices. I think Papa Egoro 
Movement [MPE] did an excellent job, regardless of the final 
results. [applause] Had I been advised, before the beginning of 
the campaign, that the movement would occupy third place as part 
of the defense of a different option, I would have participated 
all the same. [applause] 
  I will not accept any results until the final figures are 
given. If Dr. Perez Balladares wins, rest assured that the MPE 
will endorse this decision of the Panamanian people and that we 
will hand over to him our whole program and our position. 
Because this is not an issue among parties, but one that 
involves the whole country. We never took an antagonistic 
position. Some people ask me whether we will become opposition. 
I have answered that we would constitute a group of proposals, 
something we have always been. We will not change this 
position. Nor will we reject the results of the people's will. 
  [Reporter] In other words, the party will keep going. 
  [Blades] We will keep going with all of the Panamanian 
people. [applause] We will not shift our position. We started 
this political work because we have always believed there must 
be a different alternative. In the national political system, 
we have found plenty of selfishness and division. Regardless of 
the future political panorama, the country can rest assured that 
everything we said we said from the heart and will do. Papa 
Egoro will not vanish. Many parties, created just to have 
access to the distribution of power, will disappear. We did not 
create our political party with this purpose in mind. We will 
keep working, we will not vanish. I wish to take this 
opportunity to congratulate all of the MPE members who have 
worked to create this movement for more than three years. There 
are many heroes, men and women. There was a time when it 
appeared impossible to have an alternative outside of the 
parameters used by traditional parties. Party members did 
everything possible to contribute their faith and hope to this 
movement. Rest assured that this quota of hope and faith will 
flourish and grow. No one is defecting. The party is not for 
rent or for sale. The party will not quit. [applause] I also 
wish to tell everyone that I am very proud of belonging to the 
movement. 
  I believe that the work we have done has set new parameters 
in national politics. This is the first time that a political 
party has been formed without having been founded on ideological 
or economic terms or without pressure from certain national 
[?groups] or sectors. This is the first time that this has 
occurred. I think we have altered all the parameters of 
national political conduct. 
  On the personal level, I am very happy that I participated 
on 
behalf of a party that always presented its position in decent 
terms. We never attacked anyone; we never insulted anyone, even 
though there were campaigns against me, my wife, and my family. 
We never stepped back from the threshold of decency and did not 
fall prey to the temptation of returning insult for insult. We 
are not going to do this now either. 
  The person who obtains the majority of votes, and in this 
case it might be the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] and 
Dr. Perez Balladares, can be completely certain that the MPE 
will accept this popular dictate. As I said earlier, we are 
going to present our programs to improve any proposal they might 
have. I would like to say in passing that our proposals were 
the best. [unidentified voice says: Right on!; followed by 
cheers and applause] We are going to present our plans to 
improve theirs. They can be completely certain that we are not 
going to become an obstacle out of selfishness or pettiness. I 
would like the other political parties in Panama to not react in 
the traditional manner, and to refrain from attempting to block 
initiatives that are going to benefit the country. 
  [Reporter] You have said that you are going to wait for the 
last vote to be counted to recognize.... 
  [Blades, interrupting] Not necessarily the last vote. 
  [Reporter] Do you think you could surpass that figure? 
  [Blades] Let me tell you something: there are still many 
votes to be counted. I am not saying that we are going to wait 
in order to offer our support. We already are supporting the 
winner. I simply believe that we should wait for all the 
figures out of respect for the Electoral Tribunal [TE], and 
because this is the right thing to do before conceding, so to 
speak. However, I am already taking a step forward, and am 
saying we are going to support whoever wins and will not place 
obstacles before his government. We ask the same from the other 
political parties. We are not like the other political parties, 
and that is why we are asking them to do this. We are asking 
the traditional political parties to please refrain from trying 
to hinder the work of whoever wins. The work of that government 
will be done for the good of the country. 
  For basic reasons, not because we are in third or fourth 
place, we are going to wait for the TE to make its announcement, 
and we will accept their decision. Right now, as far as figures 
are concerned, everything indicates that Dr. Perez Balladares 
has won the elections. I congratulate him, the PRD, and the 
country because the electoral process was carried out honestly. 
Everyone came out and voted. We supported that and support the 
actions of the Panamanian Government, which represents Panama, 
not a party. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Blades, for some time the MPE held second 
place behind the PRD. Many people believed that the MPE would 
be the winner and that it would be able to beat the PRD, a 
traditional party. What happened? Was there some sort of 
strategic mistake for the 94 elections? 
  [Blades] No. I believe there were a number of factors. On 
the one hand, economic problems kept us from launching our 
campaign earlier. Many people on the streets told us: If you 
had started your campaign earlier, perhaps you would have had a 
chance. This argument is not a solid argument, however. We 
would not have been able to do this because we did not have the 
economic means, on the one hand, nor the organization that we 
needed at that time. 
  Additionally, we did not have a list of candidates. Any 
group that begins, and begins broke and in a decent manner, and 
I am going to repeat this over and over again -- in the history 
of Panama there has never been a party like the MPE. 
[unidentified voice says: "Never!"; followed by cheers and 
applause] 
  Within that reality, within that reality [repeats himself] 
we were never able to have a greater presence in our country's 
rural areas -- given the lack of resources, organization, and so 
on -- and we needed that. On a personal basis, everyone ganged 
up against us. Let us call things by their name. The 
partocracy [partidocracia] ganged up against us. A very 
negative campaign was launched in recent weeks and, perhaps, it 
yielded certain results. On a personal basis, we simply 
accepted that as a test. We overcame that and we continued with 
our efforts. The movement does not end. That is the good news 
for the Panamanian people. The struggle continues. [applause, 
shouts] 
  Second, I will tell you something. In the event, which 
apparently occurs now, we lose the elections, in 1999 no one 
will beat us. [applause, shouts] [chanting: "Ruben! Ruben! 
Ruben"] This does not mean I will necessarily be the candidate 
in 1999. That is something the national convention and the 
national reality will decide, but I think the MPE and its roots 
of decency are deeply planted. We will settle the situation of 
slanders and other issues in the courts; and that begins 
tomorrow. [applause, shouts] 
  [Reporter] Against whom will you file the lawsuit, Mr. 
Blades? 
  [Blades] What? 
  [Reporter] Against whom will you file the lawsuit? 
  [Blades] We will file the lawsuit against the persons who 
used false information to denigrate persons and ideas. 
  [Reporter] What party is involved? 
  [Blades] This is not a matter of parties, this is not a 
matter of parties. [repeats himself] I previously said totally 
absurd and groundless accusations have been issued. We will not 
do this in terms of a vendetta, only because we believe the 
conditions should be given in our country to clearly tell the 
whole nation you cannot say a person is something he is not. 
  [Reporter] In what way do you feel offended? 
  [Blades] Look, it was said here that I was a gringo. 
[unidentified woman laughs] It was said here that my diploma was 
forged. [unidentified woman says: It was said he never attended 
the university.] My mother, may she rest in peace, was attacked 
here. My wife was attacked here. Well, that... [pauses] she 
deplores it but we have discussed that issue and, well, such is 
life. Anyway, people have said things that are not true. 
Groups.... [pauses] persons within our group have been accused 
of being members of a national organization -- I was accused of 
being an employee of the government. In other words, a series 
of accusations have been made and we will prove in a court of 
law that they are false; and the people who published that will 
pay [words indistinct]. [applause, shouts] 
  [Reporter] What will Ruben Blades' future be while this 
happens? Will you remain in Panama? Will you continue to sing 
and feature prominently at international level? 
  [Blades] Well, since you did not give me the job of 
president 
[laughter heard in the background] I have to work any way I can. 
I have not worked for eight months. A lot of emphasis was 
initially placed on the fact that I am a singer; and many people 
in the media asked me: Well, will you stop singing? I always 
asked them: If I were a painter, would you ask me to stop 
painting? If I were a poet, would you ask me to stop writing? 
That is part of an erroneous perception that an artist can only 
play a superfluous role in our society. 
  This singer, because that is what I have always been and I 
feel very proud of that, is a singer who has placed his role as 
an artist, and his condition as a Panamanian, in a prominent 
place at the world level [applause, shouts] and I continue to do 
this in the measure of my possibilities. I feel absolutely no 
shame about this. I believe that, quite the contrary, we have 
given Panama a very positive image, and we have always continued 
to extol the role of music as a means of communication. 
  The real question is whether I will stop taking part in the 
political process and the reply is no. This is a categoric no. 
We will continue our work; the MPE will not disappear, and it 
will not disappear because it represents a banner of national 
decency. We are not going to leave, we are not going to allow 
other people to usurp what the people have given us. Something 
else I want to say today is that in every tour people would say 
to us.... [pauses] right, Ricardo [Bermudez]? Do not deceive 
us, do not deceive us. You can be completely sure that this was 
never our intention. The other thing people would say is we 
will not see you again. We said we will return regardless of 
whether we win or lose. The country can be totally sure that I 
am going to return to all the places I visited to thank everyone 
for all the support they gave us and to tell people that we will 
continue to work and toil. [applause] 
  I believe this exercise has been very positive for the 
country. I would like, please, for things to be seen in their 
proper context. We have struggled with what we call vernacularly 
the bullies [mayullones] in politics. [chuckles] We faced some 
bullies and we fought clean. The bullies delivered low blows, 
below the belt, but we did not fall. [applause] 
  This is not the right moment, on national network, to call 
attention to these sorts of things, but we do need to say this 
at the party level. Do you know what it takes to organize a 
group in three years and that this group suddenly becomes the 
second or third political force without resources or alliances? 
[applause] What we simply did was to give shape to a national 
thought and feeling. People want something different. I hope 
and everyone hopes that the next government leads us in 
resolving problems. Again, with all respect, and with our 
current position as a political party of national importance, I 
ask, please, that traditional political parties not interfere 
negatively in the work of the elected government. We must move 
ahead; we have no more time to lose in more fights, more 
insults, more slander. Now we all have to work, time is running 
out. The country needs immediate replies. We will continue to 
contribute things. It is important that this be clearly 
understood. I ask, please, all political parties. It is very 
important that we now concentrate on the task of governing the 
country, especially with the National Assembly. 
  It is important that we cast aside party rivalries; the 
personal and selfish aspects so obvious with the country's 
traditional political class. The MPE will not hinder the 
national work because we are part of this work. I ask the other 
parties to please not hinder the work of the national 
government, whatever the party. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ricardo Bermudez, second vice presidential </F>
candidate of Papa Egoro, by Lorena Castillo and Ariel Rosas at 
the Papa Egoro headquarters in Panama City on 8 May -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Castillo] The party leaders are assessing the 
Electoral Tribunal results. We will talk with Bermudez, Papa 
Egoro candidate for vice president. Mr. Bermudez is here with 
us. 
  [Bermudez] The party is just as glad as it was at the 
beginning. I think we did a very productive job. I wish to 
mention that only close to 43 percent of the voting sites have 
been accounted for. There is still nothing final. No final 
conclusion can be made before we have the final election 
results. It would be venturesome for any political party to 
claim victory without first having the total vote count. I wish 
to stress the need to remain as civically aware as we were 
today. This has been an extremely pure and beautiful election. 
But we should not jump to any conclusions before all of the 
voting sites have been accounted for. 
  [Rosas] We understand that you talked with candidate Ruben 
Blades, who is in the headquarters making assessments. What 
does Blades think? 
  [Bermudez] Blades has been in touch with us during his tour 
of the city. He should be arriving here any minute now to make 
remarks on the party position. 
  [Rosas] The figures indicate it is very difficult for the 
party to improve its situation. Do you think Papa Egoro will 
eventually improve its position before the million vote figure 
is reached? 
  [Bermudez] Since the beginning, Papa Egoro was a bastion of 
the party. We still do not know what percentage of the figures 
released represent Panama City. May I insist, however, 50 
percent of the votes are still to be counted. We should not 
jump to conclusions at this time. 
  [Rosas] Polls were conducted in the past few months among 
the 
several political parties. How do you correlate past polls with 
the figures released by the Electoral Tribunal? 
  [Bermudez] May I reiterate that the Electoral Tribunal has 
not yet released the final figures. Still 50 percent of the 
vote must still be totaled. Regarding the national polls, it is 
worth noting the movement's progressive geometrical growth in 
the past one and one-half months. I am sure that, once all the 
votes are tallied, the movement's position will be seen much 
more clearly.

<F P=106> [Statement by Ruben Dario Carles, Change `94 presidential </F>
candidate; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Those of us here make up the best presidential 
slate, and you know it because I have insisted that, 
individually and collectively, we are the best option for the 
country. In view of all the announcements recently made and the 
statements recently released, we must make the following 
observations. We already talked with leaders of the Molirena 
[Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement], Morena [National 
Renewal Movement], and Civic Renewal Party. Paradoxically, we 
the democrats make these statements, convinced that we will 
accept the results released by the National Vote-Counting Board 
as definite and fully valid. 
  Although many people never believed in elections, nor 
respect 
public opinion, we say here that we will accept what the 
Electoral Tribunal [TE] has to say. We must also say that, 
according to the information already released by it, 48 to 50 
percent of the votes have yet to be counted. In light of this 
situation, it would be irresponsible to declare any party or 
group of parties the winner. It would be even more 
irresponsible to declare an individual the winner when all the 
information has not yet been released. We know for sure that 
the information so far released by the TE lacks the foundations 
to give an opinion due to the relative importance of certain 
provinces and electoral districts in terms of number of voters. 
Thus, I believe in a country where an urban, suburban, or rural 
vote is relatively significant because of the many interests of 
its sectors. 
  I refuse to say that this or that slate won in Chiriqui, 
Veraguas, or any other province. We will accept the TE results 
when all votes have been counted. We will also subject our 
approval, as far as the results are concerned, to the honest and 
fair counting of votes for legislative, mayoral, corregimiento 
representative, and councilmen candidates. I repeat: About 48 
to 50 percent has to be taken into account properly. These 
votes represent an enormous difference for the future of our 
country. 
  As I said before, those who are here with me and those who 
are running with me are the most capable people. Our plans are 
the best ones. We also offer the best options for legislators, 
mayors, and corregimiento representatives. I refuse to say that 
a specific person is the winner, because giving opinions on a 
process that is still incomplete would be absurd. 
  Regardless of the results, the country will have as a future 
reference the fact that we offered the most capable people to 
rule. Those of us who will stay here because we live here and 
who have fought for justice and democracy now have the authority 
to become the opposition. [applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with Guillermo Quijano, vice presidential </F>
candidate for Change '94 coalition, by Axel Rivera at the 
coalition's campaign headquarters in Panama City--live] 
  [Text] [Rivera] Mr. Quijano, will you tell us how you feel 
about this process. How are your spirits? 
  [Quijano] First, I want to say one can say the process has 
been clean, clear, precise. The Electoral Tribunal has shown 
great honesty in this electoral process, something of which all 
Panamanians should truly feel proud. I hope Panama will 
continue to hold elections such as today's. 
  Regarding vote counts, I believe these results include 
approximately 40 percent of the cast votes. What we do not have 
is an idea of what sectors these results cover. In the 
particular case of Panama City's, I believe we have results from 
sector 8-7, partial results for 8-6, but I do not know whether 
there have been any results for 8-8 and 8-9, where Change '94 
held much hope. The same goes for the interior of Panama 
Province--western Panama, sectors 8- 1, 8-2, 8-3, 8-4, and 8-5. 
This also holds true for the Republic's countryside. 
Information has been released on the provinces' urban areas and 
not from the rural sectors. We will have to wait another hour 
or so until we have a higher percentage of results to allow us 
to announce some kind of decision. 
  [Rivera] Can we interpret that you still believe Professor 
Carles' trend may continue to increase? 
  [Quijano] It is possible rural sectors and other Panama 
Province sectors may begin to make a difference in the final 
result. It is too early to make any prediction. What viewers 
can be sure of is that if Change '94 is not the winner we will 
recognize the victor, because up to now the elections and vote 
count have been clean and honest. 
  [Rivera] Even if the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] is 
the winner? 
  [Quijano] No matter who the winner is. I believe the only 
way Panama can grow politically is by having those who lose 
recognize the triumph of the winners. If we win, we also hope 
the PRD recognizes our victory. 
  [Rivera] The latest provincial figures indicate that 
Professor Carles lost in Cocle Province, his home province. How 
do you explain this? 
  [Quijano] The reason is that the only votes counted so far 
are from the urban sectors of Penonome and Aguadulce, where most 
of the voters are public workers and where a high percentage 
belong to the PRD and another high percentage belong to the 
Arnulfist Party. We now have to reach into the countryside, 
Toabre, Tambo, El Roble, all rural sectors in Cocle Province, 
where we are strong.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eduardo Vallarino, presidential candidate </F>
for Christian Democratic Party, PDC, by unidentified reporter on 
8 May; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] For several hours, we have been reporting 
on this electoral process, which represents an important 
landmark in Panama's political history. Mr. Eduardo Vallarino, 
now that several hours have passed since the end of the 
elections, we would like to hear what you have to say about the 
election results. 
  [Vallarino] Panama's elections have been extremely pure and 
transparent, very civic, very enthusiastic. Panama is the winner 
in these elections. It is evident that we did not fare as well 
as we would have desired. Panama has attained a great victory, 
however. 
  [Reporter] What message do you have for the Panamanian 
people, although the final results are not yet known? 
  [Vallarino] I think the results are indeed known. They are 
determined by a number of factors which I think are 
irreversible. Although the official results are not yet known, 
it is clear that the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] won 
the elections and that Perez Balladares has won the right to 
become president. What message do I have for the Panamanian 
people? Simple: We will have a new president, elected by a 
considerable number of Panamanians and whom we all must support. 
We will become the opposition, a responsible one. 
  [Reporter] We have talked with Christian Democratic Party 
candidate Eduardo Vallarino.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eduardo Vallarino, Christian Democratic </F>
Party, PDC, presidential candidate, and Rene Orillac, PDC first 
vice presidential candidate, by Lucy Molinar at the Atlapa 
Convention Center in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] [Molinar] At this time, we are here with one of the 
presidential candidates and his first vice president. Mr. 
Eduardo Vallarino just arrived a few minutes ago at the Atlapa 
Convention Center, and we would appreciate hearing his first 
statements, as well as those of his first vice presidential 
candidate Rene Orillac. Mr. Vallarino, it would seem that the 
initial results will remain unchanged despite the optimism you 
expressed earlier. What can you now say to the country? 
  [Vallarino] Well, at this time I can say that I would like 
to 
congratulate the country. I congratulate the country because 
the elections have been a significant accomplishment for Panama. 
It has been possible to present Panama's positive image to the 
world, as I have said on several occasions. I would also like 
to say that, according to the results disclosed by the Electoral 
Tribunal and what we have been receiving throughout the country 
from our own party, we are completely certain that Mr. Ernesto 
Perez Balladares is the winner. He is the president-elect of 
the Republic, and we publicly extend our congratulations. 
  [Molinar] Mr. Vallarino, can we take a look backwards, or 
would you just like to look to the future? 
  [Vallarino] As you wish, forward or backwards [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Molinar] Then let's do both. Some time ago there was talk 
about the possibility of an alliance, because it was impossible 
for you to proceed on your own. You have seen that you received 
less than 5 percent of the votes. Why then maintain the 
alliance? [as heard] 
  [Vallarino] This alliance did not come about because of our 
doing. We tried everything to create an alliance to present a 
better offer to the country, which meant an alliance. On two or 
three occasions, I publicly said I was willing to give up my 
candidacy, to decline my candidacy.... 
  [Molinar, interrupting] Was that a genuine offer or just.... 
  [Vallarino, interrupting] Of course it was a genuine offer, 
we never aimed to mislead.... [pauses] I do not accept your 
questioning my statements. 
  [Molinar] No, I am only asking, Mr. Vallarino. 
  [Vallarino] Okay, let's take it easy. Our offer was a real 
offer. I am not lying. It is absolutely true. If the alliance 
did not come about, is it simply because there was no similar 
willingness from the others. 
  [Molinar] Mr. Vallarino, on the other hand, thinking now of 
what will take place in the future. Since I believe your party 
will now become an opposition party, what type of political 
position will the PDC adopt? 
  [Vallarino] That is a decision to be made by the party's 
political committee. You are once again putting words in my 
mouth. 
  [Molinar] I am not putting any words in your mouth, I am 
simply asking what position your party will adopt. 
  [Vallarino] Please do no attempt to put words in my 
mouth.... 
  [Molinar, interrupting] I am simply asking what position the 
PDC will adopt from here on. 
  [Vallarino] That is a decision that will be made by the PDC 
Political Committee. 
  [Molinar] Mr. Orillac, how do you feel at this time? 
  [Orillac] I feel quite satisfied, having participated in an 
election process that has demonstrated that we Panamanians are 
also capable of doing positive things. This election process 
has been positive for all. It has been crystal clear, and the 
result is clear. The message to the world is that Panama can do 
positive things. 
  [Vallarino] If the trend witnessed so far continues and the 
PRD [Revolutionary Democratic Party] emerges as the winner, what 
can you say about the possibility of some PDC members becoming 
part of the government they plan to form? 
  [Orillac] Well, I believe that will be a decision to be made 
by the party in due time. The party's political committee will 
have to meet and evaluate the possibility. At this time, we do 
not rule it out or acknowledge it. 
  [Molinar] Thank you very much, Mr. Orillac.

<F P=106> [Interview with Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential candidate </F>
of the Solidarity Party, by unidentified reporter at Solidarity 
Party headquarters in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Here we are at the Solidarity Party 
headquarters to interview Samuel Lewis Galindo, Solidarity Party 
and National Unity Mission [MUN] presidential candidate. Mr. 
Sammy, we already have the partial results of these presidential 
elections; what do you think about them? What is your first 
impression? 
  [Lewis] I believe there is a seemingly clear trend favoring 
Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic Revolutionary Party; 
however, as far as I know, the Electoral Tribunal [TE] has not 
yet released any official figures. Let us wait for some 
tangible information to ensure that we can conduct a final 
evaluation of the election results. It seems that the trend is 
indeed favoring Ernesto Perez Balladares. 
  [Reporter] The TE magistrates have reported that the process 
seems to have evolved smoothly. Has any candidate of your party 
or of the MUN complained? Have you heard anyone complaining? 
  [Lewis] We do not have any significant complaints, because 
the electoral process evolved normally. This situation must 
make all Panamanians proud, because we are displaying a great 
sense of civic responsibility. We have wisely exercised the 
right that democracy bestows upon us. This is indeed 
strengthening the incipient democracy we Panamanians have. 
  [Reporter] Are you going to promote consensus with all 
political parties regardless of who is elected president? 
  [Lewis] I will extend my warmest congratulations to the 
candidate elected through popular vote, because all Panamanians 
must join the winner and support him to ensure that we reach a 
consensus that could not have materialized before the elections. 
I trust that whoever the winner is, he will honor his 
commitments, because all the candidates talked about national 
consensus. I repeat, we hope the winner will honor his 
commitments to the Panamanian people. 
  [Reporter] Thank you very much. This was Solidarity Party 
presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo from his party 
headquarters. He has been following the elections through 
Telemetro Television Network.

<F P=106> [Interview with Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential candidate </F>
of the Solidarity Party, by unidentified reporter at the 
Solidarity Party headquarters in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Here we are the headquarters of the 
Solidarity Party, which is part of the National Accord Alliance, 
which along with the National Unity Movement [MUN] nominated 
Samuel Lewis Galindo as their presidential candidate. Mr. Lewis 
Galindo, the Electoral Tribunal [TE] has already released 
unofficial results. According to TE results, as 35 percent of 
the votes has already been counted, you are in sixth place. In 
view of this situation, what are your first impressions? 
  [Lewis] Undoubtedly, there is a clear trend favoring Ernesto 
Perez Balladares; should this trend continue, he virtually will 
become the next president of Panama. 
  [Lewis] You were always optimistic as the polls were being 
conducted. At times, you even said you were going to give the 
country a surprise. What do you have to say now? 
  [Lewis] Simply put, I failed to surprise the country. 
  [Reporter] What information have you received at the party 
level? 
  [Lewis] The information we have corresponds to or goes 
beyond 
that of the TE. I currently believe that the percentage margin 
of difference between the votes for Perez Balladares and Mireya 
de Gruber will continue. 
  [Reporter] According to the figures you have here in your 
party's headquarters, what will the percentage difference 
between the two candidates be? 
  [Lewis] I believe their difference will fall between 8 and 
10 
percent. 
  [Reporter] Finally, you always said you were interested in 
participating in another government should you fail to be 
elected. Do you still think so? 
  [Lewis] I believe it is too trivial to say that I am 
interested in participating in another government; I have no 
interest in being a member of another government. I have said 
it would be favorable for the country if whoever reaches the 
presidency calls for a national consensus. This does not mean 
that one is part of the government; it means one agrees with a 
national development plan; that is, one must support some issues 
that go beyond the interests of one's party. For instance, we 
want to fight unemployment; we want to address the foreign debt; 
we want to coordinate how to manage the Panama Canal and its 
surrounding areas. In short, there are positions that go beyond 
the interests of any political party. All Panamanians must heed 
the call made by whoever reaches the presidency. This is 
something completely different from what you just asked me. 
  [Reporter] Would you care if the Democratic Revolutionary 
Party [PRD] reaches the presidency? 
  [Lewis] Why should I care if the PRD wins? Should the 
sovereign people choose the PRD as the country's next 
government, I believe we all must accept their decision. We 
fought so hard to have a democracy, and we must now respect the 
ruling of democracy; we must accept the sovereign resolve of 
these people. 
  [Reporter] Should the situation be different, would you 
remain in the political arena or would you attend other 
activities? 
  [Lewis] I believe we have achieved many things in these 
elections. In a year and a half, we have founded a party, which 
will be more solid than ever, because it has already experienced 
an electoral campaign. The party will be strengthened by its 
large representation in the many electoral organizations. That 
is, we will have a large number of legislators and corregimiento 
representatives. The party will be well represented. 
  [Reporter] We are grateful that Samuel Lewis Galindo spoke 
to 
us.

<F P=106> [News conference by Samuel Lewis Galindo and Ernesto Perez </F>
Balladares, presidential candidates of the National Accord 
Alliance and the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, 
respectively, with unidentified reporters at PRD headquarters in 
Panama City; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Lewis Galindo] ...all of us, the six losing 
candidates, have won because we contributed to raising the civic 
level of Panamanian politics and, through our efforts, we have 
strengthened the incipient Panamanian democracy. It is now up 
to Dr. Perez Balladares to reinforce this democracy and set in 
the future an example similar to the one set by President 
Endara, for whom I publicly express appreciation. 
  [Perez Balladares] I also wish to join Mr. Galindo in this 
recognition because it is reality and represents truth. We have 
held very pure elections in Panama, despite some minor 
incidents. I acknowledge President Endara's efforts. I also 
make a public pledge that the 1999 elections will be at least 
this honest. I will not intervene in the 1999 elections. The 
Panamanian people can rest assured that on 1 September 1999 I 
will hand over office to whoever wins the elections. In the 
next five years, we expect to improve democracy in Panama, which 
starts today. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Lewis Galindo, do you acknowledge Dr. Perez 
Balladares' victory? 
  [Lewis Galindo] Definitely. Our reports, which are ahead of 
the Electoral Tribunal's results, indicate that Dr. Perez 
Balladares has won by a wide margin. For this reason, I have 
come to congratulate him in the name of my party. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Perez Balladares] The same message we have been 
transmitting 
throughout our campaign. It is a message of reconciliation, of 
national unity, the message that 8 May, election day, will be 
over in a few minutes. When this day is over, we will turn a 
glorious page with the beginning of a participative democracy, 
which we all now pledge to perfect. In addition, I am inviting 
all of my adversaries to unite with us in a single purpose so we 
can attain the national objectives, for which we intend to 
struggle in the next five years. 
  [Lewis Galindo] I am very pleased by Dr. Perez Balladares' 
remarks on the day of his victory. This reassures the 
Panamanian people that all of the electoral promises made by the 
now victorious candidate will be fulfilled. The Panamanian 
people should be pleased with this and should stay alert to make 
sure he keeps his word. 
  [Perez Balladares] I would like to add something else, which 
I think is very important. As we have said before, our 
government will be one without hatred or resentment, without 
revenge or grudges, without a return to the past, but with its 
eyes set on the future for our young people and children. 
Thanks. [applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino by Jenia </F>
Nenzen at the Telemetro Television studios in Panama City -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Nenzen] Thousands of international observers from 
all over the world have arrived in our country to closely follow 
this historic electoral process. Foreign Minister Jose Raul 
Mulino is here to talk a bit about this. We welcome him to our 
studios on 50th Street. 
  [Mulino] Thank you. 
  [Nenzen] Mr. Foreign Minister, you have had very close 
contacts with the international observers who arrived in our 
country. What were their expectations of this electoral process 
before arriving in Panama? 
  [Mulino] Yes, Jenia. I have talked with many international 
observers from different groups and with different levels of 
importance in recent days. When they came to Panama they 
thought they would find things that are quite different from 
what they actually found. They thought they would find a 
difficult electoral process with some degree of violence; and 
they had doubts about how things would go; but many of them were 
able to witness how the different candidates ended their 
campaigns. Likewise, they have talked with many Panamanians 
from different political groups; and all of them, without 
exception, coincide on various issues. 
  First of all, there has been a very high voter turnout. This 
was something we were able to confirm today at the different 
polling places. Second, the honesty with which this process has 
been carried out and the way the elections have ended today 
without any doubts. People have participated; they have voted; 
no one was afraid of being insulted or having their vote 
ridiculed. Moreover, the confidence that the different 
political groups have given the Electoral Tribunal has been 
reasserted by all the candidates and all the political parties. 
I believe that, as Panamanians, we should feel quite satisfied. 
We should feel quite pleased with the high degree of maturity 
we have demonstrated up to this point in an electoral campaign 
that everyone foresaw as being much more difficult than it has 
been. 
  Furthermore, it is important to emphasize, and I am pleased 
about this as foreign minister of the Republic, that our country 
behaved marvelously in the eyes of the world, meaning as a 
country that has matured; a country in which citizens have 
civically exercised their rights; and, above all, a country that 
has decided -- because the polling places have already closed -- 
to elect its leaders with freedom, without fear. This is quite 
different from what we experienced in 1989. 
  In addition, I think it is important to emphasize and 
acknowledge the role of those who deserve it. First of all, the 
three Electoral Tribunal magistrates and the organization they 
have led. I think the country can sleep peacefully tonight 
after its hard work. Second, the pledge acquired and fulfilled 
until now and, I am sure, until the end of the process, by the 
president of the Republic. I think his figure and name will go 
down in history as the president who respected the people's 
will; and as the president of the Republic who, after many 
decades, lead an electoral process without flaws, without 
doubts. I am sure he will turn over power on 1 September, as he 
has said on many occasions, to whoever the Panamanian people 
elect today. 
  [Nenzen] Does this mean you believe the honesty of this 
electoral process will help counter the international criticism 
of our country? Do you think this criticism will be eclipsed by 
the honesty of this electoral process, which has been truly 
historic? Is this what the international observers will report 
to their respective countries? 
  [Mulino] That is right. In fact, I have asked them to do so, 
not only in my role as foreign minister but also as a 
Panamanian. The main results of their work should be that 
tomorrow they tell the world, without beating around the bush 
and with realism, what they have seen and what they have 
observed in these elections. I believe this will tremendously 
help to favorably and positively depict Panama at the world 
level. Obviously, as we conclude our term, we also see with 
great pleasure how we leave Panama -- once more in harmony with 
other free nations; without diplomatic or political problems 
with any country in the world; and, above all, respected, 
because we have consistently stated and implemented the 
democratic principles of liberty and respect for human rights 
that we have professed in our various efforts throughout the 
world. 
  [Nenzen] To conclude, Mr. Foreign Minister, what message do 
you send the community in general? There are observers in 
Panama; the eyes of the world are on our country. What should 
the people's behavior be when the winner is announced? 
  [Mulino] I think that is the culmination of this entire 
process. When the Electoral Tribunal announces who has won the 
elections, the six losers must immediately go and congratulate 
-- without problems -- the candidate who won. I believe this 
will confirm Panamanian democracy and, evidently, when the new 
president of the Republic is sworn in for the next five-year 
constitutional term on 1 September, he is duty bound to lead the 
country democratically. I think this is what the Panamanians, 
regardless of the electoral preference they exercised today, 
will demand from the next president. He must lead the country 
with the same degree of liberty and the same sense of democracy 
that President Guillermo Endara has done in this harsh, complex, 
and many times misunderstood political transition. 
  [Nenzen] Yes. The next president of the Republic, the 53d 
president, must maintain and improve our country's international 
image, aside from meeting most of our people's needs. 
  [Mulino] That is correct.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Vice President Guillermo Ford by </F>
unidentified reporter on 8 May; place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] The people's decision is final, according to Vice 
President Guillermo Ford. Panamanians must respect the people's 
decision. 
  [Begin recording] [Ford] The elections have been a model of 
civility and have displayed a great sense of homeland. The 
international community should respect the Panamanian people. 
Most important now are the results and the Panamanian people 
abiding by the majority of the Panamanian people's will. 
  [Reporter] Do you think the political parties will accept 
the 
people's decision? 
  [Ford] All of the parties and all of us politicians must 
abide by the National Vote-Counting Board's decision, which I am 
sure will be endorsed by the various officials of the Catholic 
Church, as well as by international observers. The question is 
not whether we wish to accept the decision of the majority of 
the Panamanian people -- we must. 
  [Reporter] What do you think about the young people who have 
gone out into the streets, each in his own party's name, to 
celebrate? 
  [Ford] Inasmuch as it is celebration, I praise it; 
nevertheless, I hope such a celebration will not lead them to a 
confrontation, because we will not permit that. I am asking the 
young people and every Panamanian citizen to behave themselves. 
Let's wait for the final results to decide the next Panamanian 
president. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by James Aparicio] </F>
  [Text] Panamanian President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares 
has revealed that the Ministries of the Presidency, Education, 
Agricultural Development, Health, and Foreign Relations, as well 
as the posts of comptroller general and attorney general, will 
be offered to political figures who do not belong to the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). 
  In an exclusive statement to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA Perez 
Balladares said that PRD members might occupy the Ministries of 
Housing, Public Works, Labor, Commerce and Industry, Planning, 
and Government and Justice. 
  Current Electoral Tribunal Magistrates Eduardo Valdes, 
Dennis 
Allen, and Guillermo Marquez will remain in their posts, since 
they are considered responsible for the holding of the most 
important elections ever in Panama's political history. 
  Sources told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that Jose de los Santos 
Chen Barria, a member of the opposition Christian Democratic 
Party, might be ratified as comptroller general, and Oswaldo 
Fernandez might be retained as director of the National Police 
if he is not ratified as a Supreme Court justice. 
  Perez Balladares refused to confirm this possibility, 
however. An investigation by LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA revealed that 
the Foreign Ministry might be offered to industrialist Gabriel 
Lewis Galindo; the Education Ministry to Stanley Muschett, 
president of the Justice and Peace Commission; the Agricultural 
Development Ministry to Carlos Souza Lennox, former president of 
ANAGAN [National Cattlemen's Association]; the Presidency 
Ministry to Raul Arango Gasteazoro; the Health Ministry to 
Carlos Garcia de Paredes; and the Commerce and Industry Ministry 
to Felix Gonzalez, a PRD leader in Chiriqui Province. [as 
published] 
  PRD Under Secretary General Mitchel Doens might be appointed 
government and justice minister, and Christian Democratic 
legislator Jose Antonio Sossa might be appointed attorney 
general. 
  Two women will be appointed to cabinet posts in the Labor 
and 
Planning Ministries, but Perez Balladares did not reveal their 
names.

  [Text] Caracas, 6 May (AFP) -- Several bus lines and the 
Caracas subway, which carries 1 million passengers daily, 
suspended operations for several hours today after students took 
to the streets to protest Thursday's killing of a fellow 
student. To prevent acts of vandalism, hundreds of police 
officers were deployed along the city's main streets. 
  Nevertheless, an official VENPRES report indicates that 
students from the Santos Michelena and Rafael Urdaneta high 
schools unleashed their anger on the San Jose police station, 
throwing stones and bottles that destroyed glass doors and 
windows. 
  Thursday morning, student German Sotillo Rodriguez, 17, died 
from three gunshot wounds during disturbances staged by students 
from the Fermin Toro High School near the Miraflores 
presidential palace. The students were protesting a refusal by 
city bus drivers to honor preferential student fares. 
  Authorities have confirmed that the student was killed by 
Raul Izea Bohorquez, a metropolitan police officer, who will be 
turned over to the courts.

  [Text] Caracas, 6 May (NOTIMEX) -- A demonstration by 
students who were protesting the death of one of their 
classmates yesterday overshadowed the nine-hour meeting held by 
the presidents of Venezuela and Colombia. 
  Barely two blocks away from Miraflores presidential palace, 
Fermin Toro High School students who were holding a vigil for 
slain student German Sotillo, whom police shot to death, became 
too excited and clashed with the public security forces. 
  Presidents Cesar Gaviria and Rafael Caldera had to meet 
exclusively at Miraflores and not at the Foreign Ministry, where 
the signing of a joint document had been scheduled. 
  Even though the authorities were able to momentarily 
dissuade 
the demonstrators, who were protesting because bus drivers were 
not accepting preferential fares for students, clashes became 
more intense during the afternoon, when Sotillo was buried. 
  Following the funeral at a cemetery in this capital attended 
by approximately 5,000 high school students and people from 
various social organizations, violence returned to the streets 
of downtown Caracas, but there were no reports of casualties. 
  The Judicial Technical Police, in a last-minute report, 
stated the officer who fired the shots that killed Sotillo and 
wounded three other students confessed and was immediately 
arrested so that homicide charges would be brought against him. 
However, that announcement was unable to calm the angry 
students, whose protests spread to at least three other high 
schools in this capital. 
  In view of the prevailing tension and following the 
transportation sector's announcement to increase general bus 
fares, the students, including university students, announced 
that more protests were planned.

  [Text] Students who today accompanied the body of slain 
student German Sotillo Rodriguez to the Southern General 
Cemetery staged a march on (Baral) Avenue. 
  [Begin recording] [La Corte] As I said earlier, there were 
disturbances on (Baral) Avenue, but they were efficiently 
controlled by state security officers. 
  Students from the Fermin Toro High School burned a cargo 
truck with license plate 109ADS. With me now is Colonel Augusto 
Vera Lozada, chief of staff of Command No. 5. He will explain 
how the riots were controlled. Good afternoon, commander. 
  [Vera Lozada] Good afternoon. Our forces have been deployed 
to downtown Caracas to prevent violence; it is not our intention 
to harm anyone. We are trying to provide security to prevent 
the recurrence of incidents, and we will try to restore 
transportation in this sector. 
  [La Corte] I have been told of attempts to loot stores in 
this area. Is that true? 
  [Vera Lozada] No. So far nothing like that has happened. A 
(?truck) was burned in front of Fermin Toro High School, but the 
situation is under control. 
  [La Corte] Thank you, Col. Vera Lozada, who has informed us 
that the disturbances have been controlled, although a few 
students remain inside the school. However, the National Guard 
and the Metropolitan Police have surrounded all adjacent 
streets, including (Baral) Avenue and University Avenue, to 
guarantee the public's safety. The situation is virtually under 
control. [end recording]

  [Text] Caracas, 8 May (AFP) -- Caracas police units have 
been placed on alert and will be deployed in the streets on 
Monday to prevent potential disturbances in light of the 
complete work stoppage by 35,000 transportation drivers in the 
Venezuelan capital, it was reported this Sunday. 
  The transportation workers' show of force will effect 4 
million Caracas residents, and it is possible that drivers in 
the countryside affiliated with the sole union of small 
transportation vans and buses (interprovincial vans and buses) 
will join the strike. 
  The drivers demand a readjustment in fare prices and the 
immediate payment of government commitments owed them since 
December under a subsidy agreement for student bus tickets. 
  Meanwhile, Sucre Municipality -- the second largest 
municipality in the capital -- prohibited public demonstrations 
and suspended all classes in its jurisdiction. 
  Political analysts recommended canceling classes throughout 
the capital to avoid disturbances such as those that occurred on 
Thursday, when a police officer killed student German Sotillo 
with three gunshots. 
  Deputy Transportation Minister Francisco Urdaneta met with 
transportation workers the previous evening and promised to pay 
the subsidy debt in full as of next week. The drivers, however, 
did not accept the offer and stated that the final hour had 
arrived. 
  Newspaper sources reported that given the looming difficult 
situation, an emergency unit was organized in Sucre Municipality 
by the Caracas Metropolitan Police, the Judicial Technical 
Police (PTJ-detectives), the Directorate of Intelligence and 
Preventive Services (Disip), and Civil Defense. 
  Their spokesmen assured that the officers of these police 
units are on a state of alert and are studying strategies to 
prevent street disturbances.

  [Text] [words indistinct] today Thursday during student 
disturbances that took place a short distance from the 
Miraflores presidential building. 
  German Sotillo, a 16-year-old student, died after he was 
shot 
three times. According to students and professors of the Fermin 
Toro Secondary School, Sotillo was shot by a police officer who 
was riding on a water cannon that was being used to disperse the 
demonstrators. 
  The students were protesting against bus drivers who have 
been ignoring their right to preferential fares. The bus 
drivers, meanwhile, argue that since last year the government 
has failed to adequately subsidize the students' reduced fares. 
  [In a related 210-word, Caracas-datelined report, Madrid EFE 
in Spanish at 1550 GMT on 5 May quotes a police source saying, 
"the student was shot by unidentified individuals from a passing 
vehicle." Two other students also were reported to have been 
wounded by gunfire. After Sotillo was shot and killed, students 
threw rocks at police, who responded by firing tear gas grenades 
into the crowd to disperse the demonstrators.]

  [Text] Federal District Governor Asdrubal Aguiar has 
decided to retire the Metropolitan Police's Commissioners 
Command. When the governor explained the reasons that prompted 
his decision, he said the following: 
  [Begin Aguiar recording] I have adopted a decision, of which 
I have notified the Metropolitan Police Commander General, to 
retire all of the Metropolitan Police's High Command members who 
include eight general commissioners and six chief commissioners. 
  I consider this to be a sound measure for two reasons: On 
the 
one hand, it is essential to renew and revitalize the 
Metropolitan Police's actions; on the other hand, it is 
essential to allow some fresh air into its ranks. Moreover, the 
group of men who comprise the High Command, and who have 
rendered a valuable service to the Venezuelan Police and have 
exerted their best efforts in the struggle against crime, have 
been in active service for an average of 33 or 34 years. 
  I believe the time has come--and I instructed the 
Metropolitan Police commander general accordingly--for those 
eight general commissioners and six chief commissioners, a total 
of 14, to make way for the cadre of commissioners and inspectors 
who have graduated from the Metropolitan Police's University 
Institute. These men have received a refreshing education; they 
have new energy and vitality to prepare new plans and actions 
against crime in the capital of the Republic; and those who have 
rendered valuable services to the Metropolitan Police for 34, 
35, or 36 years should finally receive the retirement and rest 
they deserve. They should help us as much as possible on an 
advisory level which will enable them to cooperate in any way 
they can with the capital. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone from the "180 Minutes of News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Acting Treasury Minister Luis Javier Grisanti has 
said hasty purchases of dollars must be avoided, because the 
sale system at the Central Bank will offer greater transparency 
to the exchange market. 
  Regarding this measure, Segundo Melendez, leader of the MAS 
[Movement Toward Socialism] legislative wing, has termed the 
sale of foreign exchange as the most appropriate way to combat 
the escalation of the U.S. dollar. The MAS deputy explained the 
implementation of this exchange policy reveals the state has 
enough resources to solve the country's financial crisis. 
  Meanwhile, Henry Ramos Ayub, leader of the Democratic Action 
[AD] legislative wing, considered the sale of dollars by the 
Central Bank of Venezuela a necessary control measure, given the 
situation of collective irrationality. The AD deputy added 
exchange controls should have been established in the country 
long ago. 
  Jose Miguel Uzcategui, leader of the National Convergence, 
said the sale of dollars by the Central Bank is the most 
transparent exchange control that can be established. 
  In response to a poll conducted by Union Radio at the 
National Congress, most members of parliament agreed that the 
sale of dollars is a form of exchange control to contain the 
fears of citizens. In this regard, let us listen to Deputy Jose 
Miguel Uzcategui. 
  [Begin Uzcategui recording] All those authorized to carry 
out 
exchange transactions go to the Central Bank, which quotes a 
price, and based on that price they conduct the sale. This is 
the most transparent exchange control mechanism that exists in 
the world. It does not account for the abuses of rigid exchange 
controls that exist in Europe. These controls greatly limit the 
purchase and sale of foreign currency. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the lower 
chamber's Finance Commission, said the following. 
  [Begin Tarre Briceno recording] The first thing we must note 
is that there is no free sale of dollars. As a result, we are in 
the presence of a market subjected to some form of control. The 
sale mechanism is correct, because the demand will determine the 
value of the dollar within limited amounts offered for sale each 
day by the Central Bank. I think the closing of the market 
yesterday is more important than the dollar sale. By looking at 
how the day concluded yesterday, it appears nervousness is 
decreasing. [end recording] 
  Radical Cause Deputy Ali Rodriguez thinks the government is 
improvising. 
  [Begin Rodriguez recording] In any case, as we have stated 
systematically, we are responding to emergencies and we are not 
basing our response on a coherent strategic plan. I asked for 
the right to speak tomorrow at the Chamber of Deputies to 
discuss this crisis at the national level and its solution. [end 
recording] 
  In the meantime, AD thinks it is necessary to wait and see 
the results of this mechanism implemented by the executive 
branch.

  [Text] This afternoon in Barbados, Cuban President Fidel 
Castro stated that nongovernmental organizations [NGO's] have 
become a powerful force in international politics. Fidel is 
participating in the First International Small Island Nations 
Conference on Sustainable Development, and met in Bridgetown 
with NGO representatives from the Caribbean and Mediterranean 
Seas, and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. At the beginning of 
the colloquy, (Jean Preanch), spokeswoman for the Caribbean 
organizations, stressed the support to Cuba that was 
demonstrated in the recently concluded NGO summit, which 
rejected the U.S. blockade against Cuba. 
  Fidel applauded the manifestations of support and solidarity 
and received tremendous applause from the crowd when he stated: 
We feel among you that we are among friends, brothers. This is 
why I leave Barbados and this conference very happy. 
  In his closing statements, Castro stressed the importance of 
the Barbados summit for organizing an action strategy to defend 
the islands from serious, looming problems such as pollution, 
radioactive wastes, and climate changes. 
  This afternoon, Fidel met behind close doors with the other 
15 heads of state in attendance to ratify the final version of 
the Barbados Resolution and the action plan that will close the 
meeting.

  [Text] For some, one of the highlights of the SIDS [Small 
Islands Developing States] Conference is the attendance of 
Communist leader Fidel Castro, one of several leaders who graced 
the conference with his presence. For journalists, on the other 
hand, it represented an opportunity to quiz the leader about 
whom so much has been spoken, and even speculated, the most 
recent being rumors of ill health. This was clearly not the case 
as President Castro appeared full of spirit and [words 
indistinct] with a little difficlty and requiring some 
assistance, was able to handle even the toughest flight of steps. 
  The man often described as a recluse was more than eager to 
chat with members of the press at one of the many social 
functions which characterize [word indistinct] of this nature. 
Among the questions posed to the Communist leader was the 
Haitian crisis, and the role of the democratically elected 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Speaking through an 
interpreter, Castro was of the opinion that President Aristide 
should return to Haiti and continue to fight for his rightful 
place. 
  [Begin recording] [Castro, in Spanish with 
passage-by-passage 
translation into English] [in progress] .....the man leading his 
country because to reinstate him through that would make him 
lose his political stature. Aristide must return, as if for the 
first time, through victorious elections. 
  [Unidentified reporter] In Cuba, will there be diversity? 
  [Castro] You are the only one who knows.... [end recording]

  [Text] A U.S. invasion of Haiti would be a gross mistake. 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's latest threats to invade Haiti to 
dislodge the military somewhat contradict the modern dictum of 
respect for others. The Haitian military continues to control 
power and prevent constitutional President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide from returning home. The events in Iraq, then Panama, 
and now Haiti clearly demonstrate the United States has become 
the international police force that tightens the reins of anyone 
who steps out of line. 
  The case of Panama was very denigrating and offensive to the 
dignity of the Latin American nations. The invasion of Panama 
City by forces stationed in the Canal Zone destroyed the humble 
buildings of many poor neighborhoods and ended the lives of many 
Panamanians. The wounded and disabled survivors, who still 
suffer the traumas of the massive attacks by U.S. gunships, 
continue their plight from door to door demanding a modest 
compensation that would allow them to continue surviving and 
rebuild their poor huts, which U.S. artillery flattened. 
  The same could occur in Haiti; this is very disturbing, 
because thousands of Haitians will lose their lives, huts, and 
belongings if an invasion of the island does in fact occur. We 
do not know, however, what kind of reaction to expect from an 
angered people as patriotic as the Haitians. We believe a U.S. 
invasion of Haiti would not be the picnic Panama was. The 
Haitians will set a high price to their defeat. It will 
undoubtedly be a massacre that will in no way benefit the image 
of the powerful nation of the north. That does not matter. 
Clinton has already said: The Haitian military can vary this 
situation today if they wish; otherwise, they must face the 
consequences. The Haitian military must understand the grave 
nature of this decision and try and find a negotiated way out, 
while saving face and avoiding any signs of surrender. 
  The Haitian people do not deserve to be massacred. They have 
already suffered so much that there are no more tears left to 
cry; this means nothing to Clinton. He wants to restore 
democracy by fire and force, because they are the world's 
policemen, and they say God gave them that power. Meanwhile, 
all the other Latin American Nations, in their roles as 
observers, have simply said go right ahead.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- General Reynaldo Andino Flores, 
defense and public security minister, has said the Armed Forces 
are permanent despite the adoption of the voluntary draft. He 
has said: "We are accustomed to obeying," and he added this 
decision will have many benefits, because it conciliates the 
Honduran family. 
  He has also said this is what the people have wanted. The 
government and Congress have approved it unanimously; therefore, 
the military organization expresses solidarity with this new 
arrangement. 
  Andino has said the reduction in the number of military 
personnel is the responsibility of Congress, which has the power 
to do so, but he added the military institution could recommend 
a specific number, "because we are supposed to know the Army's 
needs." 
  As for the Armed Forces' future, Andino has said the future 
will be brighter, because if the voluntary draft is good for 
Honduras, it is also good for them. 
  Andino has said approval of the voluntary draft shows once 
more that "political power has always been above military power."

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella by </F>
Mauricio Carvallo in Buenos Aires -- date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Carvallo] Would you say that the [Falklands] 
islands will belong to Argentine again before the year 2000? 
  [Petrella] I believe that during the past few years, we have 
witnessed more dramatic changes in the world than actual 
possibilities that Great Britain will transfer the Malvinas 
Islands' sovereignty to Argentina. We have the examples of 
South Africa, the Middle East, the changes taking place in 
Russia, in the former Yugoslavia. The changes the world is 
experiencing are so unpredictable and fast that something like 
that could happen. 
  Argentina does not want to rush things, however. Since 1983 
and 1990, when relations with Great Britain were restored and, 
especially, with President Carlos Menem's administration and the 
implementation of Domingo Cavallo and Guido Di Tella's foreign 
policy, what has changed is our concern over the islanders' 
interests. In the past, this aspect was not taken into account 
as much as it is now. 
  [Carvallo] In what sense? 
  [Petrella] Democratic Argentina realizes that the islanders 
have their own identity, that the islands' society is no longer 
the pastoral nor isolated society it was before 1982. To a 
certain degree, the war, with all its terrible aspects, brought 
an economic well-being the islanders did not enjoy before. 
These facts must be taken into account in a negotiation. In 
fact, during all our meetings with the British and the 
islanders, we have fully respected their interests. We believe 
the islands will gradually grow closer to us through dialogue 
and the fact that Argentina continues to grow and is predictable 
from the political viewpoint. In addition, the Southern Cone 
offers a climate of harmony, cooperation, friendship, and 
firmness regarding our claim. 
  [Carvallo] But are the islanders aware of that? 
  [Petrella] There are concrete signs that lead us to believe 
that our policy has prompted a debate on the islands. If you 
read the PENGUIN NEWS (local daily) as carefully as we do, you 
will notice that the islanders discuss a relationship with 
Argentina. Naturally, it is not always fully positive. They 
argue and say rude things about us, but at least we are again a 
subject of their discussions on the future of the islands, in 
which Argentina is always mentioned. [passage omitted] 
  [Carvallo] Can you assure that Argentine will never again 
resort to the use of force? 
  [Petrella] Definitely. First, because it is not ethical; 
Second, because it does not generate solutions; and third, 
because we appreciate and need our relationship with Great 
Britain and Europe, which is almost the same thing. These are 
three very pragmatic and clear reasons that are by no means 
idealistic. When we talk about ethics we are not talking about 
idealism. We are talking about something very sound and very 
special: force does not yield solutions. It is a `boomerang' 
because in the long run it would affect our relationship with 
Great Britain and Europe. Only recently, Argentina overcame the 
U.S. and European embargo that followed the war. This problem 
has still not been solved with Great Britain who still refuses 
to sell us spare parts and military equipment. This is very 
complicated because most of Argentina's military equipment, 
traditionally was British. [passage omitted] 
  [Carvallo] It has been said that the islands have about 50 
percent more oil than what Great Britain can extract from the 
North Sea... 
  [Petrella] The two companies that have prospected for oil, 
with the purpose of finding someone interested in buying their 
study, might say that. No one has bought that study although 
the British say a phantom Argentine enterprise did but I do not 
know for sure. 
  Argentina does not want to hasten a debate that not only has 
an ecological aspect but also a very important personal aspect. 
Everyone knows that it takes a lot of people to exploit a single 
oil well and this will definitely change the islanders way of 
life which we consider sacred and something that must be 
preserved. [passage omitted] 
  [Carvallo] It is quite surprising that Argentina, through 
you, should say that it is not particularly interested in any 
oil there might be on the islands... 
  [Petrella] I am not making an official statement. It is a 
comment to a journalist who works for EL MERCURIO, from Chile, a 
friendly country... I am telling a friend that Argentina could 
not care less about the oil on the Malvinas because it has 
plenty of its own and because the oil price is not going to 
increase. When Russia floods the world with its oil, a very 
strict cartel will have to be created to prevent prices from 
dropping. 
  [Carvallo] Some believed oil could cause new tensions in the 
South Atlantic. 
  [Petrella] Between 1971 and 1982 we gave oil to the islands. 
Therefore, oil is not the problem, the problem has to do with 
the jurisdictional and legal aspects of the UK's unilateral 
exploration and exploitation in the Malvinas. This territory is 
in dispute and we cannot remain indifferent to unilateral 
actions. This is why we are seeking cooperation. 
  [Carvallo] To define sovereignty? 
  [Petrella] That is the question. We must generate a common 
space. We have already made a clear proposal regarding the oil 
to a high-ranking official. We proposed creating a joint 
authority to assign exploitation areas according to a practical 
criteria. All this must be done under the sovereignty 
"umbrella" that was created to enable these moves without either 
of the two parties acquiring better accumulated rights. 
  [Carvallo] In the meantime, Argentina is telling oil 
companies that it will oppose oil exploitation without its 
approval. 
  [Petrella] Of course. We have told them that any investment 
will encounter legal problems..., but I cannot say what we are 
going to do. We are warning the companies that this territory 
is in dispute, when there are so many other places in the 
world... We cannot or should not approve the exploration and 
exploitation of resources in these areas until that dispute has 
been settled or until the involved parties have agreed to 
tolerate each other. [passage omitted] 
  [Carvallo] Islands Governor David Tatham said to me: Why so 
much interest in a joint oil exploitation with Argentina when 
there is also Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil. What would your 
ministry say about this? 
  [Petrella] The dispute is with Argentina. Brazil, Chile, and 
Uruguay, as well as the rest of the countries of the hemisphere, 
have recognized our rights. The UK could, obviously, contact 
whichever country it wished if a dispute, recognized by the 
United Nations, did not exist. 
  [Carvallo] What do you expect from Chile then? 
  [Petrella] Solidarity. That contact with the islands be made 
considering Argentine interests in any negotiation. That Chile 
maintain the magnificent commitment undertaken by President 
Patricio Aylwin to back our rights. We regard this as one of 
Chile's greatest acts of friendship throughout our common 
history. 
  One of the main objectives of President Menem's foreign 
policy, implemented by Foreign Minister Di Tella, has been to 
maintain the best and most cordial relationship with Chile. And 
this not only because of cultural reasons but for economic and 
strategic reasons. 
  [Carvallo] Chile, however, is in the uncomfortable position 
that whatever it does may affect its optimum relationship with 
the two countries in dispute. 
  [Petrella] Argentina's stance on the UK has been to say that 
it must play a constructive role in the Southern Cone. In other 
words, it can no longer speculate on differences between 
Argentina and Chile, as in the past when some were more obvious 
than others, because there was usually mutual distrust. This 
must no longer exist. Argentine-Chilean integration must 
progress. 
  This is why any British Government gesture that may affect 
the Argentine-Chilean relationship is considered discouraging in 
Argentina. We have told the British this many times and we are 
certain we have the support of the Chilean Government. 
  [Carvallo] What has Great Britain done lately regarding 
Chile 
that may discourage Argentina? 
  [Petrella] There were three episodes. One was the British 
Government invitation to Chilean legislators to visit the 
Malvinas. This, in itself is not especially sensitive but the 
second episode -- proposing that they set up a Chilean consulate 
on the islands -- is. That would really be complicated. The 
third -- the donation of an aircraft -- is obviously a symbol of 
the conflict. Since Argentina overcame the conflict, it caused 
no more problems but many believe the British should have known 
the effect this could have caused. Anyway, the 
Argentine-Chilean friendship is very strong now. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Carvallo] Argentina and Chile also have their own 
territorial conflicts. What outcome due you expect from the 
controversy over Laguna del Desierto? 
  [Petrella] We hope our representatives will be able to 
convince the arbitrators of our rights. I believe, with all due 
respect for Chile and the arbitrators, that our attorneys have 
good grounds and are eloquent enough to explain them. 
  [Carvallo] Chile has grounds, probably even better ones. 
Therefore, how sure can Chileans be that Argentina will not 
declare any ruling on Laguna del Desierto not in its favor null? 
  [Petrella] Today's Argentina is not the Argentina of the 
past. Nor is the current relationship between Chile and 
Argentina the same as in the past. I think this answers your 
question.

  [Text] La Paz, 7 May (EFE) -- Today, the Bolivian Labor 
Federation (COB) and the government signed an agreement to end 
several weeks of stoppages, hunger strikes, violent 
demonstrations, military deployments in the streets, and 
roadblocks on all the country's highways. The COB, however, did 
not want to include the government's last wage offer, which the 
COB considered unsatisfactory, in the signed agreement. 
  The government's pledges not to raise the price of fuel and 
to guarantee job stability for public employees are among the 
highlights of the agreement signed early this morning. The 
government also pledged to build 10,000 "social interest" 
housing units for low-income families. In exchange, the COB set 
aside all pressure tactics, which have paralyzed the country for 
several weeks and placed it on the brink of a state of siege. 
  As for the wage demands, the government offered to raise the 
national minimum wage from 160 bolivianos a month ($34) to 190 
bolivianos ($41). It also offered a 12-percent raise to health 
workers and teachers, a 9-percent raise for those earning less 
than 1,000 bolivianos a month ($216), and a 6-percent raise for 
those earning more than that. The COB turned down those 
proposals as its wage demand is based on a national minimum wage 
of 400 bolivianos ($86) a month. The average wage for teachers, 
for example, is currently 350 bolivianos a month ($75). The 
government plans to implement the new salary rates even though 
the COB turned down the wage offer. At the conclusion of 
negotiations with the government, the COB warned that a new 
social conflict may flare up in a few days over the education 
reform bill.

  [Text] Attention: Tonight, the Constitutional Court 
declared that so-called personal drug doses are not illegal in 
Colombia. For example, arrests such as that of Carlos Sosa, who 
was taken into custody by police for possession of a marijuana 
joint, will no longer occur. From now on, individuals may 
legally possess the following amounts for personal consumption: 
20 grams of marijuana, 1 gram of cocaine, 5 grams of hashish, 
and 4 grams of methacholine (metacualona).

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by President Cesar Gaviria before </F>
his departure for Venezuela with unidentified reporters on 6 
May; place not given; from the "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Santa Fe de Bogota -- President Cesar 
Gaviria Trujillo has rejected the legalization of the possession 
of drugs for personal consumption as ruled by the Constitutional 
Court. He said the decision may encourage drug addiction. 
Criticizing the top constitutional court's ruling on the free 
development of personality [desarrollo de la peronalidad], he 
said that if this view is to become the norm, it should have 
been done through a decision by the Congress of the Republic or 
by referendum. Gaviria added that [words indistinct] 
implementing this rule, one should study the possibility of 
amending the Constitution to limit the individual's right to 
develop the personality. This is what the president said, 
noting that he respects the Court ruling but does not agree with 
it. 
  [Gaviria] The government will abide by but does not agree 
with the Constitutional Court's ruling to legalize drug 
consumption for various reasons. First, the government believes 
this will encourage an increase in drug consumption in Colombia, 
thus seriously undermining the tranquillity of the people and 
family development. It could also significantly increase crime 
and violence. The government does not believe this issue should 
become an aspect in the development of the individual's 
personality. Carrying that view to an extreme may have 
exceedingly undesirable effects, so I hope the Court will 
explain this in the ruling to be announced to Colombians in a 
few days. The Constitutional Court must clarify a number of 
aspects so Congress can at least regulate them in a statutory 
law. This must not turn into an absolute right because that 
would lead us to absurd decisions. The Court must make it clear 
that the use of narcotics by minors and adolescents must be 
limited or banned at the very least. Also, the Congress, or the 
Court, should be able to avoid or limit consumption in schools 
and universities. I would also say that the Court should make 
it clear....[pauses] It should at least give Congress the 
option of banning drug consumption in public places. If 
possible, it must also ban drug consumption by women who are 
pregnant or nursing. The free development of personality ought 
not lead to babies with birth defects caused by drug 
consumption. We must not say that we cannot control such things 
on account of the principle of development of the personality. 
That would lead to absurd situations. 
  It must also be clear that drivers or pilots cannot take 
drugs. No one could live in this society if that were allowed on 
the grounds that it is personality development. As president, I 
would say that free development of the personality cannot mean 
that Colombia is unable to campaign against drug abuse because 
that would hamper the development of the personality. We would 
become a society that regards drug consumption as desirable and 
advisable. We may almost have to encourage it, something that 
greatly disturbs the government. The government has taken 
other considerations into account. True, some U.S. states and 
European countries have legalized drug consumption. Those 
decisions, however, have had controversial results. I 
understand that consumption has increased in the countries where 
drugs have been legalized. 
  Aside from that, the legislatures have made those decisions 
following a very broad public debate. I do not know if 
countries or states allow the personal use of hard drugs like 
cocaine. I do not have that information. I have not heard of 
that because the extremely high level of addiction makes us 
quickly realize that it is not a matter of personality 
development but of a simple addiction or illness. 
  If we turn this into a personality development issue, that 
means we cannot force people to undergo treatment. I do not 
know of any country in the world that has reached that extreme. 
  I return to the same point. I think the ruling must allow 
Congress to pass a law governing all these aspects. I would 
also say that the countries that have taken these steps, as I 
said before, did so after a broad discussion and based on a 
political decision made by Congress or the citizens. I think 
that if this option were to be pursued, it would have to be 
discussed by Congress or made by decision of the citizens in a 
popular consultation. 
  I would even understand if the Court stated that this cannot 
be considered an offense or violation, but Congress' authority 
to make decisions of this type in a governing law must be 
preserved. If that is not possible, I hope the Court's ruling 
will allow Congress to establish restrictions on all I have 
said. I would go even further. I think this possibility must be 
examined in case it is decided that the state will be unable to 
establish those restrictions. We would then have to think about 
amending the Constitution to place limitations on the right of 
autonomy and the development of personality. We could even ask 
citizens in the near future if they agree with a change of this 
nature in the Constitution by way of a referendum. 
  As time goes by, I hope to say more about this issue. I 
really hope the Constitutionality Court will clearly establish 
that no abuses will be committed and that limitations will be 
established within this decision, with which the government does 
not agree. As I said before, I, as head of the government, will 
abide by this ruling as we are mandated to abide by the 
Constitutionality Court's rulings. I believe, however, that the 
promulgation of this law as the development of individual 
personality could have serious and dangerous implications for 
Colombian society. [Words indistinct] I hope the Court's ruling 
at least allows Congress, through a governing law, to place a 
series of limitations on that decision by the Court. Otherwise, 
there may be very grave implications for this society. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, will the government take immediate 
action to overcome this impasse, taking advantage of the state 
of internal disturbance? 
  [Gaviria] No, no, no. We are not going to resort to the 
state of internal disturbance to respond to a Constitutionality 
Court ruling. We are forced to wait for the Constitutionality 
Court's ruling to analyze its scope and implications. Only then 
will we decide what to do regarding limitations on said 
decision. We hope we can resort to Congress to establish 
something that the Constitution and the very Court rulings have 
established; that is, that the law have reasonable limitations. 
We are living in a state of law, so it must be possible. I 
cannot imagine the Court granting the absolute right to consume 
drugs in Colombia. This could also lead to unreasonable 
situations. 
  If no limitations are set, it is possible that suicide and 
even abortion could be legalized. No! Personality development 
has clear limitations. In Colombia and all civilized societies, 
there are limitations. The Court has declared legal mayoral 
decrees establishing limitations on alcohol consumption, so I 
cannot understand how the Court deems it reasonable to establish 
limitations on alcohol consumption but not on drug consumption. 
I go back to another absurd point, which I hope the 
Constitutional Court ruling will clarify. This may mean that 
medical prescriptions for drug consumption cannot be written 
because they limit the development of personality, and people 
have the right to consume any drug with any number of effects. 
This is incorrect, and I hope the Court clearly establishes the 
capacity and right of society to set limitations in this 
instance. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, could the Court ruling, at some 
point, support the prosecutor general's proposal to legalize 
drugs and [words indistinct] international level? 
  [Gaviria] I cannot answer that question. You would have to 
ask the prosecutor general directly. You would have to ask him 
if the elimination of sanctions on drug use is part of his 
proposal or if he believes the legalization issues must be 
studied further. Only the prosecutor general can answer those 
questions. 
  [Reporter] The U.S. Government protested Colombia's 
decision on the media. Is there any official statement on that 
yet? 
  [Gaviria] No, I think it is irrelevant. It is a domestic 
matter. I was not talking about international consequences, and 
I am not going to. I think we must discuss this here and now as 
a domestic issue; as a Colombian issue. 
  Again, I sincerely appeal to the sensibility and maturity of 
the Constitutionality Court and hope it does not make this an 
absolute right. If they do, it could lead us to truly absurd 
and dangerous situations. I hope we do not go so far as to call 
this an absolute right of an individual in the development of 
his or her personality that allows no limitations. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, the country's coffee growers have 
asked the government to study coffee prices on the local market, 
given that the price on the international market has surpassed 
the one-dollar mark. Will the government entertain their 
petition? 
  [Gaviria] The treasury minister, who is authorized to make 
such decisions, has the full support of the president and the 
government and therefore speaks on behalf of the government. He 
will establish the government's position on this as soon as 
Jorge Cardenas Gutierrez, president of the National Federation 
of Colombian Coffee Growers, returns from abroad. Cardenas must 
first present his report before the federation's National 
Commission to explain the perspectives and projections in this 
field, after which the National Commission will discuss the 
issues. The minister will discuss his position with the coffee 
growers and the National Commission. They will analyze their 
options and reach the most beneficial decisions for the 
federation and for the community in general. I am quite sure 
that it will be possible to find an agreement with the coffee 
growers at the National Commission, as we have hundreds of times 
before. 
  [Announcer] That was President Cesar Gaviria before leaving 
for Caracas, Venezuela for a first visit with President Rafael 
Caldera. This is the president's first meeting after being 
elected OAS secretary general.

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] A veritable powder keg was set off by the 
Constitutional Court's decision to legalize personal drug use. 
President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo was the first to express his 
rejection, stating very strongly that he does not agree with the 
decision. The Court, in view of the avalanche of criticism by 
presidential candidates and by the population in general, 
defended itself by saying that a mountain is being made out of a 
molehill. 
  The government and the Constitutional Court had a difference 
of opinion regarding the impact of the decision to legalize the 
personal consumption of drugs. The president says it is 
dangerous, while the Constitutional Court says the government 
and the Congress have ways to cope with the situation. 
  [Begin recording] [Gaviria] First, the government believes 
this will encourage an increase in drug consumption in Colombia, 
thus seriously undermining the tranquillity of the people and 
family development. It could also significantly increase crime 
and violence. 
  [Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango Mejia] That is 
a 
respectable opinion, which I do not share. The Constitutional 
Court has exercised its legitimate function of interpreting the 
Constitution. It has determined that a norm is contrary to the 
Constitution. 
  [Gaviria] It must also be clear that drivers or pilots 
cannot 
take drugs. No one could live in this society if that were 
allowed on the grounds that it is personality development. 
  [Arango] Regarding alcohol, a person can imbibe liquor, but 
he could commit a crime if he infringes upon the rights of 
another person in a criminal way. [end recording] 
  Finally, the court president said it was contradictory to 
authorize personal drug consumption and punishments for it at 
the same time.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with President Guillermo Endara by TVN </F>
News Director Luz Maria Noli in Panama City on 8 May -- live] 
  [Text] [Noli] We have President Guillermo Endara on the 
telephone line. Go ahead, Mr. President. 
  [Endara] Thank you very much, Luz Maria. I am calling you to 
report that I have just made a decision, along with the minister 
of government and justice. I have decided that public workers 
will be excused from duty tomorrow until 1230. I just signed a 
decree stating that the public sector will not work tomorrow 
morning until 1230. This will allow workers to participate in 
the vote-counting process. 
  I also want to take this opportunity to ask the private 
sector, particularly the National Council of Private Enterprise, 
Panamanian Chamber of Construction, Chamber of Commerce, 
Industrialists Association, and all Panamanian businessmen to 
follow suit. We ask them to allow their workers to report for 
duty tomorrow at 1230. Why? Because I think the people, in 
addition to witnessing the voting, must witness the 
vote-counting process. The vote-counting process must be 
absolutely aboveboard, and I want the people to see how their 
votes are counted. 
  What we are experiencing today in Panama is something we 
have 
not seen for years. This opportunity will not present itself 
again for another five years. Therefore, I ask the private 
sector to excuse their employees from duty until 1230 tomorrow. 
It is worthwhile for the Panamanian people to see how their 
votes are counted, and it will allow us to know for certain who 
the real president of Panama is. I will relinquish power to 
that future president of Panama regardless of who he may be, but 
I want all the people to witness the vote-counting process. 
  I thank you very much, Luz Maria, for allowing me to inform 
public workers of a decree issued excusing them from work until 
1230 tomorrow. This will allow Panamanians to witness how their 
votes are counted. They must go to their voting tables and see 
how their votes are counted. 
  [Noli] Thank you, Mr. President, for choosing TVN to make 
this announcement.

  [Text] Today, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro is completing 
the second day of his official visit to Barbados on the occasion 
of the Global Conference on Small Developing Island States. 
Reporter Ruben Pino will give us further details on this. 
  [Begin Pino recording] The plan of action and the Barbados 
Declaration were finally approved today after an extensive 
workday of this First Global Conference on Sustainable 
Development of Small Island Developing States, during which the 
floor was given to the 13 speakers who were unable to speak 
during the previous session. 
  Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, who yesterday afternoon 
presided over the final part of that top-level meeting, also 
joined the roundtable meeting of chiefs of states and of 
governments, who held a meeting behind closed doors as of 1130 
this morning. 
  During the final day of sessions in the (Cherbun) Center, 
Commander in Chief Fidel Castro met with Lloyd Erskine 
Sandiford, President of the Global Conference and Prime Minister 
of Barbados. Sandiford said his country is continuously working 
for everything related to the Caribbean and outside the region, 
seeking Cuba's full integration into the American system in an 
effort to overcome the current differences. The Barbadian prime 
minister added that Cuba as a Caribbean nation plays an 
important role in the development of the region and of the 
hemisphere. 
  Likewise, the Cuban president said he was impressed by the 
independent position the Carribean region adopted throughout its 
history concerning Cuba, and expressed interest in tightening 
relations within the context and objectives of the Association 
of the Caribbean States. 
  Fidel Castro also stressed the delegates' contribution to 
the 
debate, adding that Cuba will work for the implementation of all 
the decisions adopted by the conference in its plan of action. 
  Late this afternoon, Fidel Castro also held a meeting with 
approximately 100 representatives of nongovernmental 
organizations [NGO's] who participated in the Conference of 
Small Island Developing States. 
  During this meeting, (Jian Frenz), coordinator of 
nongovernmental organizations from the Caribbean, briefed the 
Cuban president about the resolutions adopted by the 
participants of that forum in support of the Cuban people's 
right to their development, and against the U.S. blockade. In 
this exchange of ideas, the commander in chief expressed his 
recognition of the growing power of the NGO's and the important 
contribution they have made in creating an awareness of the need 
to take care of the environment, an awareness he did not 
perceive among politicians during the Rio de Janeiro summit. 
  Fidel Castro also expressed thanks for the solidarity and 
support for the Cuban people, and underscored the contribution 
of the government representatives during the forum paralleling 
the global conference. He added that the influence of good ideas 
can be felt everywhere, and also within the NGO's. You are 
leaving us a valuable experience and for this reason, the 
feelings of dignity, independence, and honor are present in each 
of you, and they are part of the great battle you are waging.

  [Text] Today, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro placed a 
wreath at the spot where a Cuban plane crashed in 1976, victim 
of a criminal sabotage. Outstanding sportsmen who were returning 
home bringing many trophies for the fatherland died in this 
accident. 
  In Bridgetown, our top leader assessed some aspects of the 
Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island States 
with the local and foreign press. Conference special 
correspondent Gisela Bel Heredia has provided a portion of the 
news conference granted by Fidel Castro in Bridgetown: 
  [Begin recording] [Heredia] Do you feel satisfied with this 
first visit to a Caribbean state? 
  [Castro] Yes, very much so. And now I would like to know 
this 
island better because during the days of the conference one gets 
to know only the streets and buildings. But the people are very 
friendly, very educated, and hospitable. I am taking home a very 
good impression of them. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Would you ratify the idea that Cuba 
has attended this forum with a very broad political commitment 
with the people of this island? 
  [Castro] Of course. It could not be otherwise. It could not 
be different. These contacts began in Rio de Janeiro with the 
group of island states, and I was able to perceive a great 
concern conveyed by all those countries, namely over the 
climatic changes and the increase in water level. The situation 
of these islands is very dramatic. It is a situation of life or 
death because a phenomenon of this nature is much more serious 
for them more than for anybody else. 
  [Reporter] But many developed nations have been absent or 
are 
absent from this conference. 
  [Castro] Yes, they were absent, but I have noticed a little 
more awareness concerning this problem, more than what I saw in 
Rio de Janeiro. 
  [Reporter] Do you think this conference of the Caribbean 
states will pave the road for closer relations? 
  [Castro] Well, the path was being paved, and we hope it will 
contribute to a tighter relationship. It is very important to 
get to know the leaders, to become aware of their way of 
thinking, and as you know, I was not absent a single minute from 
this event. I do not know whether you have been here all this 
time and seen everything. 
  [Reporter] Yes, we have been here. The Barbadian prime 
minister has said he will try to overcome all differences 
seeking Cuba's integration into the organization of Caribbean 
states. What are those differences? 
  [Castro] He was not referring to differences between us; 
between us there are no... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] No, but to some obstacles that 
could 
exist in... 
  [Castro, interrupting] The obstacles are well known. [end 
recording] 
  The Cuban president today held a meeting with Governor 
General Nita Barrow, sister of the late Barbadian Prime Minister 
(Harold) Barrow. Fidel said that for him, it was a commitment to 
make this visit because the current governor general is the 
sister of the former president who had excellent relations with 
Cuba. Today, he has scheduled meetings with reporters from the 
regional news agency CANA and from the Caribbean Broadcasting 
Union [preceding words in English] television station which 
transmits for the entire area. 
  Today, Fidel Castro is scheduled to visit the Rainbow 
Warrior 
boat of the ecologist group, Green Peace. This boat has anchored 
at Bridgetown port with an onboard fair on sustainable 
technology in environment preservation. 
  Bridgetown, capital and main port of the Barbados islands, 
with a little more than 20,000 inhabitants, has just been the 
place of one of the most important meetings this year for the 
not very much publicized alliance of small island states. 
  The first Global Conference on Sustainable Development of 
Small Island States, which concluded its sessions yesterday, 
approved its plan of action and the Barbados declaration as the 
guide for sustainable development of the smallest islands. 
  But can there be sustainable development in one single part 
of the world, and development in all other countries? And can 
there be such development in extremely wealthy societies which 
believe that only by growing will they survive, and which can 
grow only at the cost of all its natural resources? Why do they 
need more wealth? President Fidel Castro referred to these 
questions in the speech he delivered at the conference held at 
the (Cherbrum Center) in Bridgetown. 
  From the very beginning, Fidel said the poor and the small 
countries always try to know how are we going to survive in the 
next decades, while the powerful nations discuss ways for a new 
distribution in the world. For the super developed societies, 
the problem is not to grow but to distribute, and not only to 
distribute among themselves but to distribute among all. 
  The Cuban president then said that sustainable development 
is 
impossible without a more just distribution among all nations. 
Whether we want it or not, today, mankind is a single family, 
and we will all have the same fate. We must use less deceitful 
words and change the current philosophy because this selfish 
philosophy has only served to cause the catastrophies we are 
suffering today and the worse ones we will suffer in the future. 
  Shortly after the Cuban president's speech, Barbadian 
Foreign 
Minister Branford Taitt told Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina during a bilateral meeting that no foreign pressure can 
prevent the Caribbean community from taking the necessary steps 
to reinstate Cuba into the economic mechanisms of the Caribbean 
Community and into the future Association of Caribbean States. 
  He also said that Fidel Castro's speech to the plenary 
session of the conference was brilliant. He added that his 
presence in Bridgetown has enhanced the conference and has 
helped to establish fundamental elements in the strategies for 
sustainable development of small islands. 
  Expressions of solidarity were also conveyed to Roberto 
Robaina during bilateral meetings. Robaina said: We hope and 
wish that ties will be strengthened between Cuba and the rest of 
the Caribbean islands, and we can cooperate to help Cuba 
overcome its current problems.

  [Text] The following is the first official bulletin issued 
by the Electoral Tribunal [TE] on the development of the 8 May 
elections: 
  The first report was received from the Veraguas Provincial 
Directorate, where 535 voting tables have been set up. 
Provincial Director Gilberto Estrada reported that the 
elections began normally with good voter turnout, who said they 
wanted to vote quickly. Only one voting table reported problems. 
Two officials scheduled to be present at a voting table at the 
Juan Demostenes Arosemena School did not show up, so they were 
replaced at 0830. The voting table is now fully staffed. The 
10 electoral delegates are all performing their assigned tasks. 
A candidate for representative in Veraguas Province was caught 
in a government vehicle that was loaded with campaign 
propaganda. He was detained. 
  In Concepcion Bugaba District, Chiriqui Province, one person 
was caught distributing ballots outside a voting site. This 
person has been remanded to the appropriate authorities. 
  Reports received at 0900 indicate that the voting process is 
proceeding normally in Bocas del Toro Province, with 212 voting 
tables; Cocle Province, with 410 voting tables; Chiriqui 
Province, with 830 voting tables; Herrera Province, with 281 
voting tables; Los Santos Province, with 248 voting tables; 
Panama Province, with 2,290 voting tables; and Veraguas 
Province, with 135 voting tables. 
  The sources reported that a vehicle rented to the TE was 
involved in an accident near Colon. The driver, Roberto 
Salcedo, was admitted to the Amador Guerrero Hospital for 
observation. 
  We have reports that a heavy rain has been falling in Colon 
since early this morning. The weather is clear throughout the 
rest of the country. 
  The sources consulted all stressed the large voter turnout, 
especially in Herrera, Los Santos, Panama, and Veraguas 
Provinces. The sources also stressed the order and discipline of 
the voters at the various voting sites, especially in Panama 
Province, where there are 2,290 voting tables, 45 percent of the 
country's total number of voting tables. 
  This has been the first official bulletin issued by the TE 
on 
today's elections. We will have more reports for you in the 
next few hours . Thank you.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Rafael Caldera and Colombian </F>
President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo with domestic and foreign 
reporters, moderated by Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, chief of the 
Venezuelan Central Information Office, from the Ayacucho Room of 
Miraflores Palace in Caracas--live relay] 
  [Text] [Alvarez] Let's begin with Mr. Luis Eduardo 
Maldonado, representing Colombian radio stations. 
  [Maldonado] President Gaviria, you are about to complete 
four 
years in office. How are relations with Venezuela? Are they 
better off, the same, or worse, and in what area? 
  [Gaviria] Before answering your questions, I want to 
reiterate what I said this morning: The Colombian president's 
happiness in coming here with all the Colombian cabinet members 
-- an unprecedented action in Colombian politics -- to express 
to President Caldera and all the Venezuelan people our 
solidarity, and our willingness to continue working in the area 
of integration, which has been so fruitful and positive. 
  During this special working session held today with 
President 
Caldera and all the members of his cabinet and Venezuelan 
officials, we discussed all the areas which advanced during the 
last few years. We discussed how close the relationship has 
become and how much we have advanced in trade and in many other 
aspects. We discussed how useful the mechanism of the 
negotiation and integration commission has been. We also 
established new goals and objectives. We reviewed progress in 
many positive aspects and how new problems have appeared, some 
of which are growing problems; but this is normal in a 
relationship, one sharing a 2,200 km border, that has advanced 
so much. 
  Our government's assessment of relations with Venezuela is 
that the integration process has been very fruitful and 
positive. We -- Colombia and Venezuela-- have the most 
advanced commercial and integration process in the developing 
world today. We must continue to further that process. We must 
continue to resolve controversies and problems. We must resolve 
together the problems we are facing and open new possibilities 
for integration. 
  [Alvarez] Lucy Faustino, representing Venezuelan television 
stations. 
  [Faustino] My question is addressed to the Colombian 
president. One week ago you told an international news agency 
the following, and I quote: We are always going to have 
problems in relations with Venezuela. The important thing is to 
deal with the problems patiently. In light of those words, 
which can somehow be interpreted as an unrealistic definition of 
the coexistence of binational relations, how can Venezuelans 
interpret your words? Can we expect effective results from this 
summit to overcome those problems you addressed? Can you 
briefly summarize those problems you deem most important? 
  For Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, I would like to 
know 
if you agree with your colleague's view, and do you term it 
optimistic, pessimistic, or realistic? 
  [Gaviria] I think it is unrealistic to think we will only 
advance in positive aspects. We have made significant progress 
regarding trade over the past years, and we are reaching the $2 
billion figure in trade. We have made significant progress 
regarding investments, and it is public knowledge how Colombian 
investments have increased in Venezuela and vice versa. We have 
progressed in transportation, physical integration, and our open 
skies policy. 
  The negotiation commissions have done a great job and have 
advanced in designing proposals and solutions in the area of 
basins, immigration, river navigation, and border delimitation. 
In all these aspects, an important and interesting job has been 
done, but, obviously, the border is a long one. Exchange brings 
about new problems. The greater flow of people brings new 
problems. The immigration issue remains unresolved, and it has 
even been complicated furthered by kidnappings and car thefts. 
One can even say certain problems -- drug-trafficking problems 
-- have worsened. Regarding this, there is a new relationship 
between the Armed Forces, particularly since 1988, which is 
helping to resolve these problems. 
  We must be realistic. We have made significant progress, but 
we still have problems that must be dealt with. We cannot rip 
our clothes apart, nor can we cry out every time there is a 
conflict, every time an incident occurs. 
  We all have to try and pay attention and resolve such 
incidents, conflicts, and problems, within the framework of this 
relationship. This is a relationship between sister nations, 
nations that have found integration, nations that have found the 
developing world's most advanced system of integration. By the 
same token, we must realize that because of this, we will never 
have a relationship free of conflicts or incidents. What we 
have to do is face them constructively and positively, without 
making a big deal out of every incident; that would be a mistake 
of which our children and descendants would never forgive us. 
They will never forgive us if we try to turn each small 
incident into a conflict. 
  [Alvarez] So we do not create any bad habits. I believe that 
later we should ask President Caldera to answer that same 
question, when he answers another question. William Parra, 
representing Colombian television. 
  [Parra] Colombia has stood out among the nations of the 
world, because it has paid the highest price in the 
anti-drug-trafficking fight; unfortunately, there is news 
regarding Colombia's proud struggle. The Constitutional Court 
has decided to legalize a specific drug dose for personal use. 
What is the Colombian president's response to the 
Constitutional Court's decision, especially in light of the 
unanimous rejection expressed by Colombian sectors? There is 
even a letter from the business associations stating that if 
Colombia and the government want to hold a referendum to reject 
the court's decision, they are willing to pay for all the 
publicity. What is the Colombian president's response to this, 
and what kind of image does this create abroad of the country's 
anti-drug-trafficking struggle? 
  [Gaviria] I gave a full response to that before I left this 
morning, but allow me to explain something quickly now. We will 
abide by the Constitutional Court's decision, but we do not 
agree with it. We do not agree because of the serious effects 
it could have on Colombians' health. This can create violence. 
We do not agree with the rationale behind the decision, which 
says this is something concerning the development of one's 
personality. We are highly concerned with this, and we must 
wait for the ruling to be handed down. The decision was mad, 
but the ruling has not been issued yet. We hope the Colombian 
Congress will be able to issue a law establishing limits, which 
is required for such a decision. I am referring to the limits 
that should be established for consumption by children and 
teenagers, consumption in schools and public places, preventing 
drivers and pilots from using drugs, and all these other normal 
restrictions any community must impose when taking such a step. 
  There should be clear provisions for people to be able to 
appeal for and receive medical treatment for drug consumption. 
I do not believe the Colombian community or society can in any 
way accept drug consumption as something good or as something 
against which it cannot fight. The president has also said that 
in countries or in U.S. states where this decision has been 
adopted, this has been a decision made by citizens or their 
representatives. This should not be a judicial decision but, 
rather, a decision of the Colombian parliament, the Colombian 
Congress, preceded by a public discussion on the implications of 
such a decision, such as health and family considerations; in 
fact, I have mentioned the possibility of a referendum, for 
which our Constitution provides. 
  [Alvarez] Miss Paola Badaraco, representing Venezuelan 
newspapers. 
  [Badaraco] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Together with 
the question asked by my colleague from your country, I would 
like to know or advise you that in Venezuela, a judge from the 
state of Tachira has just released 32 people implicated in the 
laundering of drug money. Do not both of you, the two 
presidents, fear that the struggle against drugs could founder 
in light of such decisions by the judicial branch? Thank you. 
  [Gaviria] It would seem to be a question for... [pauses] 
That 
is news to me. Well, yes. What Colombia's Constitutional Court 
decided in principle -- I say in principle, because only an 
announcement on a decision has been made, not a ruling -- is to 
eliminate sanctions or penalties for personal drug consumption. 
They invalidated the provision stating that personal drug use 
was a violation of Colombian legislation. 
  The president of Colombia's Constitutional Court clearly 
said 
that this does not mean that drug trafficking will now be legal. 
The sanctions set forth in our codes for drug trafficking and 
drug production remain unchanged. This only refers to the 
elimination of penalties for personal drug use. As far as I 
understand, the court invalidated the articles establishing 
arrest for this type of violation. 
  This in no way weakens the struggle against the drug cartels 
or drug traffickers. I am sure Colombian society would never 
take such a step, much less at the international level. 
  [Alvarez] Maria Elizabeth Vargas, representing Colombian 
press. 
  [Vargas] Good afternoon, Messrs. Presidents. How does the 
recent devaluation of the bolivar affect bilateral agreements, 
and what kinds of agreements were reached? 
  [Gaviria] I would say this is basically a question for the 
Colombian president -- a question on how decisions adopted by 
Venezuela regarding its currency can affect the agreements we 
have signed. Today, for the first time, the economic cabinets 
of both countries held their meetings, despite the fact that 
they had a framework for solutions within the bilateral 
integration agreements. They held the first meeting today and 
reviewed the situation, and let us say they did so within the 
terms of the agreements of the two countries with other regions 
and with the G-3 [Group of Three], of the agreements with 
Central America and the need to boost these accords, of the 
agreements with the Caribbean, and also a review of the 
macroeconomic situation. We are alert, and we are keeping 
abreast of what is happening. Colombia, obviously, is not going 
to make any decision. 
  Colombia hopes to assimilate the exchange rate decisions 
made 
by the Central Bank and the Venezuelan Government. We hope 
these economic decisions adopted by President Caldera's 
administration will in no way alter our integration process. We 
do not plan to adopt any measure to affect that integration 
process. 
  We trust in this process and have found Colombia's 
participation in this process to be enriching. We hope to 
contribute to help Venezuela overcome its recent economic 
difficulties. For this, President Caldera, his government, and 
the Venezuelan people can count on our full support. 
  [Alvarez] Representing international news agencies based in 
Venezuela, Mr. Roberto Cienfuegos. 
  [Cienfuegos] Good afternoon, Messrs. Presidents. 
Representatives of your governments and of Mexico are meeting 
today in Santa Fe de Bogota to analyze the future of the G-3. 
My question is this: When do you plan to culminate the free 
trade agreement that you proposed? Also, excuse me, but this 
question is being asked throughout the region: Will President 
Gaviria, when he assumes his post in the OAS, commit his efforts 
toward Cuba's total reintegration into this organization? Thank 
you. 
  [Gaviria] I will respond regarding the G-3. The will of the 
two economic groups of both countries -- the one expressed by 
all members of the economic cabinets -- was clear-cut in wanting 
to culminate the G-3 agreement soon and to proceed to sign it. 
  We all agree that the G-3 is very important and serves as 
the focal point of economic integration with the Caribbean, 
Central America, and a large portion of South America. Also, we 
hope the few differences we still have can be resolved promptly. 
Negotiations are taking place in Santa Fe de Bogota today, as 
one journalist has already noted. We hope that the process can 
be finalized. 
  Today, President Caldera and I are hoping -- and we have 
already taken steps to place the telephone call -- to call 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas to reaffirm our political 
commitment and our wish to finalize the G-3. The ministers of 
the two countries have made this recommendation to us, and we 
have accepted it. As soon as this news conference is over, 
President Caldera and I hope to talk to President Salinas. 
  As for Cuba, I would simply like to make a very broad 
statement, because I cannot take action on this issue without 
the mandate of the organization after I have assumed the post of 
secretary general. I think all Latin Americans, without 
exception, believe... [pauses] We want Cuba's reincorporation 
into the inter-American system. Nevertheless, we also want 
political and economic changes to take place in that country, 
making this reintegration possible. All of us want democratic 
progress in Cuba, as well as progress toward a market economy. 
I think all of us in general agree on using diplomacy to 
achieve these ends. 
  [Alvarez] Here is Raul Gutierrez, on behalf of 
Colombia-based 
international correspondents. 
  [Gutierrez] Mr. Caldera, the thorny issue in relations 
between the two countries is the border dispute. Looking ahead 
to when President Gaviria steps down, are you considering the 
possibility of direct talks within an international court or the 
termination of this border dispute? 
  [Caldera] Venezuela has been in favor of the idea of 
dialogue. There is no reason to interrupt it. The talks held 
between the commissions appointed a few years ago have explored 
many paths toward resolving this dispute. Many steps have been 
taken toward understanding and recognizing the importance and 
significance of demarcation. We have agreed on the need for a 
global approach. This is not the only country, not the only 
problem, and should not be considered a thorn in anyone's side. 
  As President Gaviria has said, there naturally will be 
problems between two countries with such a long-lived border -- 
countries that feature so many various interests. There will be 
more problems in the future. Nevertheless, there are no 
differences that cannot be resolved through dialogue, and there 
is no dialogue that cannot lead to a solution, especially when 
there is an awareness of the need and the willingness to become 
integrated. 
  [Gaviria] I would briefly like to reiterate what I told the 
negotiating commissions this morning. The Colombian Government 
has complete confidence in the mechanisms on which Colombia and 
Venezuela have agreed to resolve this and other problems between 
the two countries. Here, I am talking about direct dialogue and 
negotiations, as well as the negotiating commissions themselves 
-- mechanisms that we regard as adequate for resolving not only 
the border dispute, but also the problems of immigration and 
river navigation, problems shared by the two governments. 
  The political forces of both countries have been represented 
in this process of negotiations and talks. We believe these 
mechanisms are proper and appropriate, and we also believe that 
the overall approach has made it possible to make great progress 
in the resolution of common problems and to take positive steps 
in the economic, physical, and cultural integration of the two 
countries. 
  [Alvarez] The final question of this news conference will 
be asked by Mr. Jose Lugo, who is representing the Venezuelan 
radio stations. 
  [Lugo] Good afternoon to both presidents. This question is 
for Mr. Gaviria, and here I am departing a bit from the area of 
bilateral relations. 
  Considering the support extended to you by the U.S. 
Government in your bid to become the next OAS secretary general, 
what position will you adopt, once you are in that post, 
concerning the announcement of an intensification of the 
blockade against Haiti and the possibility of a military 
invasion of that Caribbean island? 
  [Gaviria] I have decided not to play the role of OAS 
secretary general until after I am sworn in. I do not intend to 
express any OAS-related views until I assume the position. 
Currently, I am the president of Colombia, and I will not 
express any views on any issue except as president of Colombia. 
I will express those views at the appropriate forums, the OAS 
and United Nations, if those topics are discussed there. As 
president of Colombia, however, I believe that I speak for my 
country when I say that all of us truly yearn to see the full 
restoration of democracy in Haiti through the appropriate 
mechanisms. 
  [Alvarez] Thank you, Messrs. Presidents, for your presence 
at 
this news conference, and thanks to all of the journalists of 
Colombia and Venezuela.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Yesterday, upon announcing the 1994 
budget proposal, Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero stated that 
from now on, the government will have the moral authority to 
demand that other sectors of society, like businessmen and 
workers, make sacrifices to enhance the anti-inflation policy. 
He said: "We are cutting beyond the meat; we are already 
reaching the bone." Having said this, Ricupero harshly 
criticized the health sector, which is pressing for more funds 
and is increasing its expenditures. Ricupero warned that social 
security and health expenditures are endangering the budget 
balance. 
  After stating that the government is firmly committed to 
balancing its public accounts, the pillar on which the success 
of the economic plan is based, Ricupero said: "These expenses 
are jeopardizing the government's projects. There are no funds 
left for other sectors." Planning Minister Beni Varas, who 
charged the health sector with poorly managing its resources, 
made a similar criticism two weeks ago. 
  Despite acknowledging the hardships and difficulties that 
the 
health sector -- hospitals included -- is experiencing, Ricupero 
blamed previous governments for the worsening of the delay in 
transferring resources. Ricupero said hospital expenditures 
today exceed the overall spending of the government apparatus. 
  Ricupero added: "In March, we transferred 589 billion 
cruzeiros for health expenses while overall state expenses 
totaled 530 billion cruzeiros. This fact was worrisome because 
health expenses are increasing geometrically." He noted that 
President Itamar Franco ordered the Applied Economic-Social 
Research Institute (IPEA), which is linked to the Planning 
Secretariat (Seplan), to verify health accounts to determine 
what problems are occurring there. 
  Ricupero reported that thus far this year, the government 
has 
disbursed only 23 percent of the one-twelfth portion of the 
budgeted amount that can be used prior to congressional approval 
of the budget. "This represents less than one-fourth of what we 
could disburse," he said. "The public sector is making its 
contribution to economic stabilization," he added. 
  In the draft budget submitted to Congress, the government 
reestimated its revenues, bringing them up to $98.725 billion 
this year. In the previous proposal, revenues had been 
estimated at $88.7 billion. Estimated expenditures were also 
changed from $88.6 billion to $98.723 billion. Thus, the 
government expects to close 1994 with an operational surplus 
(revenues less expenditures, including payments on interest on 
the foreign debt) of only $2 million. The economic team 
believes it will obtain a primary surplus (revenues less 
expenditures) of $7.7 billion, which would be equivalent to 1.7 
percent of the gross domestic product. 
  Government economists regard the budgetary balance as a 
basic 
condition for the success of the plan. The team believes that 
upon the elimination of the public deficit, one of the main 
causes of inflation -- the issuance of both currency and bonds 
for the financing of current accounts -- will disappear. 
Ricupero said: "We are proposing a budget that would prevent 
the public sector from affecting the country's economic 
performance."

<F P=106> [Article by Aziz Filho] </F>
  [Excerpts] Workers Party [PT] presidential candidate Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva has adopted a more radical style against 
neo-liberalism. In Rio de Janeiro on 5 May, he promised that if 
elected, he will create a "strong government" to intervene in 
the economy, not to nationalize it, but to control the market 
and the strategic sectors and to fight tax evasion. 
  Lula plans to review the privatizations conducted during the 
administrations of former President Fernando Collor and 
President Itamar Franco, to change the concession system for 
radio and television stations, and to create a state-owned 
educational television network of very high quality. Lula said 
the constitutional reform failed because "no one was able to 
make lazy congressmen vote." 
  Addressing Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc. workers at the 
Brazilian Press Association, Lula said he wants "a strong 
government, not a weak and fragile one. He wants a government 
capable of intervening in the social and economic areas." He 
criticized the current administration for "not having the 
courage to fight the financial system, the oligopolies, and the 
cement cartel." Lula said a strong government would fight tax 
evasion, expand and reorient the domestic market, and seek 
social justice. [passage omitted] 
  Lula tried to calm entrepreneurs' fears about the socialist 
profile of his party. He pointed out that the government 
program approved by his party members does not force him to 
declare a moratorium on the foreign debt, but to maintain 
suspension of payments as a weapon to be used depending on the 
creditors reaction to the negotiations he plans to conduct. He 
gave examples of how the government can intervene in the 
economy: by stimulating the establishment of leather industries, 
clothes manufacture, toys, and school materials in small urban 
nuclei, "thus creating a bond between the citizen and his native 
region and preventing the poor in the northeastern region from 
moving to the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo shantytowns where 
they become totally destitute and miserable."

<F P=106> [Article from "Castello's Column" by Marcelo Pontes: "Lula's </F>
PhD and the Others' Sins"] 
  [Text] Five years after his 1989 election defeat, but 
principally following his trips around the country, Workers 
Party (PT) candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva is now more 
mature and better prepared. 
  Lula is no longer the threat that led [Sao Paulo State 
Federation of Industries President] Mario Amato to predict, 
during the last elections, a flight of businessmen from the 
country if he won. Yet there is also no guarantee that, once 
elected, Lula will become a traditional president, like all the 
others. 
  He begins by saying that he will not govern the country from 
Planalto Palace but he will be a field president, travelling the 
country, getting closely involved while solving the people's 
problems, and governing, together with his cabinet, in the 
field. Naturally, there is some electoral rhetoric in this. But 
beyond his promise of a new governing style, we have seen that 
Lula's trip around the country has made him a candidate apart 
from the rest. 
  He did not begin campaigning with a government model 
prepared 
by experts in the great urban centers in mind. He comes from 
the interior, heading for Brasilia with his heart and mind on 
problems that are simpler and more important for the small 
communities, for the humblest groups of professionals. 
  This union leader, who 15 years ago raised the conscience of 
the Sao Paulo industrial belt metal workers, found during his 
tours in the interior that 300,000 babassu nut harvesters in 
northeastern Brazil, a group larger than the Brazilian 
automobile industry workers, work under subhuman conditions. 
  Lula speaks of a farming cooperative in Telemaco, Borba, 
(Parana), or of the peasants in Mirandiba (PE) [Pernambuco) or 
in Nova California (AC) [Acre], like Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
speaks of the Cavallo Plan in Argentina, or of the stages of an 
economic stabilization program. 
  Naturally, the intellectual education of the two cannot be 
compared. Fernando Henrique is a professor with a PhD from the 
Sorbone University. Lula, who barely reads and writes, has 
gained a PhD on Brazil. It would not be surprising if, once 
elected with this curriculum, Lula ends up being a simple 
councilman, or a super mayor. But equally, nothing guarantees 
that Fernando Henrique's respectable curriculum and that of his 
not-always-respectable allies will ensure that he wins the 
elections. At least the coarse curriculum of Lula is more 
useful in obtaining votes than the text books of Fernando 
Henrique, mainly because this is a country of illiterates. 
  Beside truly representing Brazil and maintaining a 
continuous 
line of political consistency -- Lula arrived in migrant worker 
trucks to become a factory worker in Sao Paulo, lost a finger 
while working on a power lathe, defied industrialists and 
generals, broke with labor union taboos, resigned his deputy 
mandate disgusted with Congress, and began smoking expensive 
cigars without losing his custom of drinking sugar cane brandy 
like a farm hand -- Lula's current main campaign asset is the 
sins of his contenders. 
  Orestes Quercia, considered the probable winner of the 
internal PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] elections, 
received a setback that will be very hard to overcome: the 
attorney general is charging him with violating Law No. 171 on 
fraud, in a case of importing weapons from Israel to equip the 
Sao Paulo police when he was governor. Jose Sarney, who expects 
a miracle from the PMDB machinery, is Lula's ideal contender and 
the PT's best way to approach the PFL [Liberal Front Party], 
which has joined Fernando Henrique. Leonel Brizola is 
practically ignored by one third of the national electorate -- 
22 percent in Sao Paulo, and 11 percent in Minas Gerais. 
  Fernando Henrique is experiencing a delicate moment. As 
finance minister, he obtained an economic miracle: he created 
two inflations: one in real cruzeiros which he doubled from 20 
percent to 40 percent; and another in URV [Real Value Unit] 
which is expected to reach 2.62 percent in April or 5.86 percent 
in a hypothetical calculation since January. Fernando Henrique 
depends on the success of the implementation of the new 
currency, the real. It is still doubtful if eventual success in 
curbing inflation will allow him reduce the distance between him 
and Lula. 
  As a candidate, Fernando Henrique has still not left his 
office. Although he allied with the PFL, he has faded and 
obtained no gains. It took too long to reach the alliance. He 
lost some colleagues in this effort. In the process to choose a 
running mate for his ticket, an Alagoas senator, he ended by 
dividing the very party bloc he wanted to add to his own. 
Fernando Henrique runs the risk of being abandoned by the urban 
educated middle class that did not approve his alliance with the 
PFL and of losing the rural PFL followers if he does not quickly 
put out the fire in his alliance. In all, he is doing favors for 
Lula which the best campaign strategists would be unable to 
predict. 
  If all this were not enough to allow Lula begin to show a 
winning profile for the first voting round -- even the numerous 
factions in his own party, including the most radical ones, 
suddenly seem to have been pacified -- there still floats in the 
air the Ayrton Senna effect. The feelings awakened by Senna's 
example must be channeled somewhere.

  [Text] Manaus -- The Army has increased the number of 
officers and noncommissioned officers who will be trained at the 
CIGS [Intensive Jungle Guerrilla Warfare Training Course] in 
Manaus from 150 to nearly 350. In addition to increasing by 
more than 100 percent the number of personnel who will be 
trained annually in antiguerrilla warfare and jungle survival, 
the leading military training school in this area, which was 
created in 1964, has increased the number of courses from three 
to seven. 
  CIGS Commander Luiz Roberto Fragoso Peret Antunes is a 
42-year-old lieutenant colonel. He reports that the students 
are trained to fight in an area of 1,500 square kilometers of 
jungle located between the municipalities of Manaus and Rio 
Preto. He adds: "Instructors show them how to take advantage of 
the flora and fauna of the jungle and to take precautions 
against its natural dangers." 
  For over 30 years, CIGS has also trained 184 foreign 
servicemen. Attending a course that started yesterday are two 
students from Argentina, three from Ecuador, two from Paraguay, 
one from Guyana, two from Uruguay, three from Mexico, and five 
from France. According to Peret, they learn "only general rules 
about how to operate in the jungle." Strategic information on 
how to fight in the jungle is given only to Brazilians.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 5 May. 
  According to information published by the DIARIO OFICIAL, 
Central Bank profits reached $20.1 billion in 1993. According 
to Getulio Vargas Foundation economist Rubens Cysne, real 
profits amount to $4 billion, as the so-called inflationary tax 
of $16 billion, which the productive sector transfers to the 
banks because of inflation, must be deducted from the original 
figure. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 2 May 94 
p 11) 
  After registering record sales in March, when 118,000 units 
were sold, the Brazilian automobile industry registered a 25 
percent drop in April, when 94,000 vehicles were sold. This 
number includes imported cars. In April, Volkswagen sold 33,000 
units, Fiat 25,000, General Motors 21,000, and Ford 13,000.

  [Text] Havana, 7 May (PL) -- Today, the Cuban Government 
acclaimed the National African Congress' [ANC] electoral victory 
in South Africa and said the end of apartheid constitutes a 
landmark in the struggle against imperialism, racism, and 
colonial domination. 
  In an official statement, the Cuban Government stated the 
election results end an arduous process of negotiations between 
South Africa's leading political forces, a process that will 
pave the way to racial equality, freedom, and justice for the 
South African people. 
  The statement also said the end of apartheid befits the 
process of profound transformations that took place in the 
African South Cone following the battle of Cuito Cuanavale in 
Angola, which effected a change in the correlation of forces in 
that region of the world. 
  In the same document, Cuba also stated it is willing to 
establish diplomatic relations with South Africa, to which Cuba 
offered cooperation and support in the new stage of 
reconstruction and consolidation of national unity. 
  The Cuban people, the note added, have made the South 
African 
people's cause their own and, together with all progressive 
forces, bids the new government success in the complex and lofty 
tasks that lie ahead.

  [Text] Havana, 7 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President Fidel 
Castro praised Cuba's contribution to the independence of 
several African countries and said apartheid was bound to 
disappear in South Africa sooner or later because it was 
unsustainable in today's world. 
  In a statement to Barbados' CBU [as received] Television 
that 
was broadcast today by Cuban television, Castro said: "The 
effort made (by the Cuban fighters) helped safeguard Angola's 
independence and hastened the independence of Namibia and the 
elimination of apartheid." 
  Castro also extolled the sacrifices made and the struggle 
waged by the South Africans and the Namibians to reach their 
objectives, saying: "Sooner or later, Namibia would have been 
independent, and apartheid would have disappeared anyway." 
  Castro praised African National Congress leader Nelson 
Mandela (who won the elections). He mentioned Mandela's 
leadership capabilities and wisdom, which allowed him, the Cuban 
leader said, to remain firm but at the same time flexible to 
reach "this political miracle," which I view as a very great 
victory for the people of South Africa, the world, and the 
progressive forces. 
  The Cuban leader has been in Bridgetown, the capital of 
Barbados, since 4 May. He went there to participate in the 
high-level sessions of the first World Conference on the 
Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which concluded 
yesterday. 
  When asked about conditions for normalizing relations 
between 
Cuba and the United States, first, Castro cited the end of the 
economic blockade Washington has imposed on Cuba for more than 
30 years, a blockade he characterized as hard, unjust, and cruel. 
  Second, the Cuban leader also believes it is necessary for 
the White House to understand Cuba is an independent and 
sovereign country. Third, the Cuban people's right to have the 
political, economic, and social system they consider best must 
be respected. 
  Saying it is not Cuba who is besieging another country and 
that Cuba does not want to change the social system or install 
socialism in the neighboring nation to the north, Castro 
affirmed: "We have nothing against the United States." 
  The Cuban president praised the recently concluded 
conference 
in Barbados. In his opinion, it made politicians and 
industrialized countries aware of the need to prevent the 
degradation of the environment.

  [Text] Accra, 8 May (PL) -- Tonight, Ghanaian President 
Jerry John Rawlings greeted Cuban President Fidel Castro, who 
arrived in this capital at 1030 on a service stopover en route 
to South Africa, where he will attend the inauguration of Nelson 
Mandela. Rawlings expressed his satisfaction at receiving the 
Cuban leader and viewed his visit here as official despite its 
brevity. 
  Castro is accompanied by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; 
Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government; and Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of 
environment, science, and technology. This same delegation 
participated in the First World Conference on Sustainable 
Development of Small Island States, which ended on 6 May in 
Bridgetown, Barbados. 
  Speaking to reporters before leaving for Barbados, the Cuban 
leader considered it a political miracle that Mandela managed to 
conciliate the different ethnic forces in his country in such a 
way that the first interracial elections were successfully held 
with the triumph of Mandela's party, the African National 
Congress (ANC). 
  "Mandela is the perfect man, the only who with the talent, 
necessary wisdom [word indistinct] current political moment in 
South Africa," the Caribbean statesman stated. 
  "Cuba's commitment to Africa is a historic one." We do not 
want to speak of our contribution to the South African people's 
cause, because they -- the ANC and Mandela -- have made the most 
important contribution. 
  Nelson Mandela will be inaugurated this coming Tuesday, 10 
May, during a ceremony in Capetown, which will be attended by 
many heads of state and government from all parts of the world.

  [Text] Pretoria, 9 May (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
arrived today in this beautiful capital, in which Afrikaners 
have kept themselves segregated for decades from natives, to 
attend the inauguration of Nelson Mandela, the first black 
president of South Africa. 
  The Cuban delegation, headed by Castro, was one of the most 
eagerly awaited here. The African people believe that Cuba, 
particularly Fidel, had to participate in the celebration of 
Mandela's victory, according to opinions expressed yesterday 
during Castro's brief stopover in Accra, the capital of Ghana. 
  During his brief visit, Castro had a friendly meeting that 
lasted until the late hours with President Jerry John Rawlings, 
who welcomed Castro at the international airport in this capital 
and invited him to the presidential residence, where they 
discussed matters of common interest, particularly within the 
African context. 
  Tomorrow both Rawlings and Castro will participate in the 
ceremony during which outgoing South African President Frederik 
de Klerk will transfer the government to President-elect Nelson 
Mandela. It will be a momentous ceremony not only in the 
history of this country but for the entire black continent as it 
marks the end of apartheid. 
  "We have a moral and historical commitment to South Africa," 
Fidel Castro said before traveling to Pretoria accompanied by a 
high-level delegation that includes Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina; National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon; and Rosa 
Elena Simeon, minister of environment, science, and technology. 
  "Fidel Castro's presence at Mandela's inauguration is not 
merely a matter of protocol," Foreign Minister Robaina told 
PRENSA LATINA today. "We want to show that Cuba's ties with the 
people of South Africa and of this continent were forged in the 
struggle for independence and strengthened by the blood shed by 
hundreds of Cubans who fell fighting against the same forces 
that the ANC now defeated at the polls," he added. 
  Mandela's ANC won the 27 April elections and will create a 
government of national unity in which de Klerk will be the 
second vice president. 
  In Fidel Castro's opinion, "the most difficult task for 
South 
Africa begins now, but Mandela is the perfect man for the job 
because he has the wisdom and talent that the political climate 
demands."

  [Text] Pretoria, 9 May (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
told PRENSA LATINA today that to attend Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration for president of South Africa is a historic 
experience for the peoples of Cuba and the world. 
  Castro made the remark as he boarded an airplane in Accra, 
the capital of Ghana, after a 12-hour stopover en route to 
Pretoria, where the first black president in South African 
history will take office on 10 May. 
  "I am very pleased to have stopped over in Ghana and to have 
met with the Ghanaian people," said the Cuban leader, whom 
Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings welcomed last night at 
Katoka Airport. 
  Concerning his meeting with Rawlings, a longtime friend, 
Castro said he was very pleased, although the meeting was very 
brief, because Rawlings was also traveling to South Africa. 
  Castro's trip to South Africa is an important, historic 
event. Mandela was in jail just five years ago for trying to 
eliminate the system of apartheid and when Cuban troops were 
fighting in southern Angola against the South African Army.

  [Text] Pretoria, 9 May (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
reiterated to antiapartheid leader Nelson Mandela the Cuban 
Government's resolve to establish diplomatic relations with the 
South African state and to cooperate and support it in this new 
phase. 
  In a message released in Pretoria by the Caribbean 
delegation, Castro told the South African president-elect of the 
Cuban people's joy over the establishment of a multiracial and 
democratic government in South Africa. 
  The Cuban head of state said in brief statements to PRENSA 
LATINA he wishes Mandela peace, harmony, and unity in the great 
task he must fulfill as of tomorrow when, during a solemn 
ceremony, he takes the oath as president of South Africa. 
  Castro had earlier expressed joy at being in South Africa 
for 
Mandela's inauguration. The two men will meet for the first 
time in Pretoria tomorrow, during the solemn ceremony. 
  Castro added this is an important day: "It is an opportunity 
to experience an event of historic importance for the peoples of 
Cuba and the world," he said. 
  The Cuban president is one of 42 heads of state who have 
announced they would attend the event, which will also be 
attended by many well-known figures. 
  The Caribbean statesman arrived in Pretoria by highway from 
Johannesburg, where he arrived on Monday on a flight from Accra, 
where he spent a 12-hour technical stopover en route from 
Barbados. 
  Castro was welcomed in Ghana by his friend Ghanaian 
President 
Jerry John Rawlings, who within the past few hours also traveled 
to South Africa where the presidents of Nigeria, Angola, 
Zimbabwe, Sudan, and Palestine have already arrived. 
  A source close to the Cuban delegation disclosed Castro has 
already received several requests for interviews and meetings 
from heads of state and government, and from journalists who are 
in South Africa. 
  Among the earliest requests were those from the presidents 
of 
Sudan, Nigeria, the PLO, and South African television stations. 
  It is expected the period following Mandela's inauguration 
will be one of intense work for Castro, the source added. 
  The Cuban high-level delegation is lodged at the Arcadia 
Hotel and consists of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Ricardo 
Alarcon, president of parliament, and Environment, Science, and 
Technology Minister Rosa Elena Simeon.

<F P=106> [By special correspondent Maria Elena Gil: "Robaina Believes </F>
Cuban Assistance to Small Islands a Commitment of Honor"] 
  [Text] Bridgetown, 5 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that Cuban 
representatives have come to Barbados to reaffirm a commitment 
of unity, show support for small island states, and point out 
the lack of understanding others have shown for the problems 
experienced by the small countries. 
  He said: "We are not the ones experiencing the greatest 
difficulties. Cuba is not only interested in resolving its own 
problems, but it is also interested in devising common 
strategies for cooperation among all the members of AOSIS 
[Alliance of Small Insular States], which includes the small 
islands of the Caribbean, the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, 
the Mediterranean, and Oceania. 
  The Cuban foreign minister is one of the participants in the 
high-level sessions of the First World Conference on the 
Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which is being 
held in Bridgetown. 
  Robaina believes the presence here of a high-level Cuban 
delegation headed by President Fidel Castro and also including 
Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban parliament, and Minister 
Rosa Elena Simeon, represents a continuation of the policy Cuba 
maintains toward the Caribbean and the rest of the island states. 
  He added: "Cuba has the commitment of honor of joining 
efforts with small island states threatened by natural 
catastrophes as well as by a hostile economic environment. Our 
place is at [words indistinct] depend on many resources or a 
large amount of land, and we have to use our creativeness to 
ensure the wellbeing of our people." 
  Cuba has significantly contributed to the various seminars 
of 
the governmental meeting and to the parallel meetings held by 
the Nongovernment Organizations [NGO]. 
  At these meetings, Cuban delegates will speak about measures 
to combat natural disasters, technology for sugar-industry 
byproducts, the maintenance of agricultural production, and 
environmental protection and biodiversity. 
  At the conclusion of yesterday's NGO session, the 
representatives recommended to the chiefs of state in charge of 
ratifying the Barbados Declaration that they include in it a 
call to the United States to obey the UN resolution that demands 
the lifting of the economic blockade on Cuba. 
  Eight chiefs of state and government will speak at today's 
morning session, including Cuban President Fidel Castro, and 12 
environment and development ministers, in addition to Assistant 
Secretary of State Timothy Wirth, who at the last minute 
replaced U.S. Vice President Al Gore, whose participation in the 
event had been announced.

  [Text] Bridgetown, 4 May (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel 
Castro is leading his country's delegation to a summit that will 
approve important documents on sustained development for small 
island states, among which Cuba is the largest in size and 
population. 
  The arrival of the Cuban president and a high-level 
delegation of Cuban Government officials in Bridgetown today 
increased attention on the first general conference on the 
sustained development of small islands, organized by the AOSIS 
[Alliance of Small Insular States], which belongs to the Group 
of 77. 
  The Cuban delegation comprises Ricardo Alarcon, president of 
the National Assembly of the People's Government; Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina; Ecology Minister Rosa Elena Simeon; 
and others. 
  The Barbados summit is scheduled to approve a declaration 
and 
an agenda for the sustained development of these small 
countries. It also will review proposals from a meeting of 
nongovernment organizations (ONG), which is holding 
complementary meetings with the conference. 
  The high-level meeting, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, 
will close the discussions which began on 25 March at the 
Sherbourne Center in Bridgetown, during which the participants 
considered the most desirable guidelines needed to face the 
effects of climatic changes in the states participating in the 
forum. 
  The other 10 heads of state and government have already 
arrived in Bridgetown to hold an informal AOSIS summit in 
addition to the official discussions.

  [Text] Bridgetown, 6 May (PL) -- Nongovernment 
organizations (NGO) have become a very powerful force in 
international policy, Cuban President Fidel Castro said today 
during the first World Conference on the Sustainable Development 
of Small Island States. 
  During an informal meeting with Caribbean, Pacific, 
Mediterranean, and Atlantic NGO representatives at the 
Sherbourne Center in Bridgetown, Castro said these organizations 
did know about environmental policy and many other fields. 
  "Perhaps roles will be switched one day; perhaps the NGO's 
will organize a world conference, and the presidents will hold 
like forums," Castro said to the audience's delight. 
  At the beginning of the dialogue, Caribbean NGO Coordinator 
Joan French cited the support for Cuba during the recently 
concluded forum these organizations held. 
  On that occasion, they issued a resolution to defend the 
Cuban people's right to choose their own development model and 
to condemn the U.S. Government for the economic and financial 
blockade against the island. 
  Castro appreciated the expressions of support and solidarity 
and said "we need to change the negative atmosphere the United 
States has created around us with the blockade, which is causing 
us serious supply problems in the areas of food, medicine, and 
many other products that are fundamental for our development." 
In this regard, he said, your support fills us with enthusiasm 
because we not only need physical strength, but also moral 
strength. 
  "Many people have approached us to tell us marvelous things 
about the Cuban revolution, Che Guevara, things that demonstrate 
a spirit of justice, freedom, and dignity that are present in 
many delegations to this island conference." 
  Castro drew a great round of applause when he said: "I feel 
as if I am among friends, among brothers. That is why I will be 
leaving this country and conference with great joy." 
  During the discussion of another topic of the informal 
meeting, the Cuban leader joked about speculations regarding his 
health, speculations that appeared today in the local media and 
which journalists from a Miami television station who traveled 
to Bridgetown last night insisted on asking him. 
  "They are constantly asking me about my health, if I sat 
down 
before or after the speech delivered during the plenary session. 
Actually, I can no longer do the things I did during the days of 
Sierra Maestra, but I still walk around much and swim for 
several hours," Castro said. 
  In his final statements, the Cuban head of state talked 
about 
the importance of the meeting to draft an action strategy to 
allow for the defense of the islands from the serious problems 
threatening them, such as pollution, radioactive wastes, and 
climate changes. 
  Castro will meet with the 15 other heads of state present 
here at a round table behind closed doors this afternoon to 
discuss the latest version of the Barbados Declaration and the 
action program that will be the basis of this world conference. 
  The meeting began in the capital of Barbados on 25 April 
with 
the attendance of delegations from 21 countries, which are 
members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).

  [Text] Bridgetown, 6 May (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel 
Castro and Barbadian Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford agreed 
today to express their mutual desire for integrtation in the 
Caribbean as a requirement for the development of small islands. 
  During a private bilateral talk, Sandiford told Castro 
Barbados is willing to work hard inside and outside the 
Anglo-American community to guarantee Cuba's full integration 
into the inter-American system. 
  Sandiford and Castro met briefly during a recess of the 
final 
sessions of the first World Conference on the Sustainable 
Development of Small Island States. The Cuban and Barbadian 
foreign ministers also attended this meeting. 
  Sandiford said Cuba has a pivotal role to play in developing 
the Antillean region and the hemisphere. He added Barbados 
would help facilitate Cuba's full integration into the community. 
  Castro replied the independent position Barbados has 
historically assumed regarding the Cuban cause impressed him 
very much. Castro also expressed his confidence bilateral 
relations will become closer, particularly in the context of the 
future Association of Caribbean States, which will be 
established in Bridgetown next July. 
  Sandiford thanked Castro for the Cuban delegation's 
participation in the conference. The conference concludes today 
in Barbados. 
  Cuba attended the high-level conference with the largest 
delegation among members of the Alliance of Small Insular 
States. Members of the Cuban delegation included Fidel Castro, 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, National Assembly President 
Ricardo Alarcon, and Environment, Science and Technology 
Minister Rosa Elena Simeon, among others.

Fidel Castro tossed a floral wreath into the waters of Cross Bay 
to honor the martyrs who died when their Cubana de Aviacion 
plane crashed off the coast as a result of terrorist sabotage. 
  It is a very special moment for me, Castro told PRENSA 
LATINA. From the very beginning, when this trip was planned, I 
decided to come here and make this offering to the martyrs of 
Barbados, Castro added. 
  Visibly moved, Fidel Castro walked along the shore for a few 
minutes and overlooked the horizon where 18 years ago the 
flaming plane fell with its 73 passengers. 
  Eleven Guyanese, six Koreans, and 56 Cubans, including the 
entire Cuban National Youth Fencing Team, which had just won the 
Central American and Caribbean championship in Caracas, were on 
that Cubana de Aviacion flight. 
  After his visit to Cross Bay, President Castro told PRENSA 
LATINA that he was very pleased with his first visit to this 
English-speaking Caribbean country. They are a warm, friendly, 
and very educated people, Castro said. 
  Regarding his meetings in the past few days with other 
Caribbean leaders who also attended the recently concluded World 
Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island 
States, Fidel Castro said he received numerous expressions of 
solidarity from the Caribbean heads of state. The entire 
Caribbean is in favor of Cuba's integration to the region, 
Castro said. 
  Today, the Cuban president met with Governor General Nita 
Barrow, sister of the late Barbadian Prime Minister Erroll 
Barrow. Just before his meeting with Nita Barrow, Castro told 
PRENSA LATINA: It is my duty to meet with her because the 
governor general is Barrow's sister, and he maintained excellent 
relations with Cuba. 
  Castro's Saturday agenda includes meetings with 
correspondents from CANA and the Caribbean Broadcasting Union 
who report and broadcast to the region. 
  Fidel Castro will also visit the "Rainbow Warrior," a 
Greenpeace ship that docked at the port in Bridgetown with an 
exhibit on board on environmental protection technology. 
  Cuban President Fidel Castro arrived in Barbados on 4 May to 
attend the conference. He is accompanied by Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban 
National Assembly of the People's Government; and Rosa Elena 
Simeon, minister of environment, science, and technology.

  [Text] Bridgetown, 6 May (PL) -- The Barbados Declaration 
was ratified today at the conclusion of the First World 
Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island 
States. The participating governments committed themselves here 
to implementing, by way of a new action plan, the 
recommendations contained in the Agenda 21. 
  The document adopts the goals outlined in the Agenda 21 of 
Rio de Janeiro '92 in the paragraph dedicated to small islands 
on specific policies, actions, and measures to be carried out at 
the national, regional, and international levels in favor of 
sustained development in these territories. 
  The declaration says the survival of small islands is 
threatened, as well as their human and natural resources and 
cultural heritage. It adds that plans for sustained development 
should continue, giving full attention to the special needs of 
women, children, youth, and indigenous peoples. 
  It reaffirms the sovereignty of island states over their 
natural resources and their responsibility in preserving their 
sea and coastal resources, as well as their biodiversity and 
national ecosystems, through international cooperation. 
  The document stresses the special role to be played by 
nongovernmental organizations and the importance of their 
cooperation with governments to implement the Agenda 21 and 
action plans at the national, regional, and international levels. 
  It notes that because of their size, small islands have 
particularly vulnerable economies that depend on scarce 
resources and world trade, without any means of influencing the 
latter. 
  Based on these considerations, the 17 heads of state and 
governments committed themselves to formulating and implementing 
policies for sustained development that will include social 
progress, health, and environmental protection, mobilizing all 
resources available for improving the quality of life. 
  They agreed to promote regional and subregional cooperation 
among the small islands and the international community. They 
also agreed that the international community should cooperate in 
the implementation of the action plan to provide new and 
additional funds in accordance with the [words indistinct] 
facilitating the transfer of technology, protecting intellectual 
property in developing countries, and promoting commercial 
agreements that will not be discriminatory against them. 
  The Barbados Declaration makes the international community 
responsible for the protection of small islands to minimize the 
negative effects of natural disasters on their frail ecosystems 
through multilateral cooperation. 
  In the document, the small islands commit themselves to 
eliminating or reducing negative patterns of consumption and 
production and to promoting adequate policies for democratic 
development. 
  Rosa Elena Simeon, Cuban minister of science, technology, 
and 
environment and member of the delegation accompanying Cuban 
President Fidel Castro, described the Barbados Declaration and 
the joint action plan as positive, specific, and of great social 
content.

  [Text] Panama City, 6 May (PL) -- Today, Cuba reiterated 
its respect for Panama's internal affairs after reporting that 
attempts had been made by some progovernment political sectors 
to implicate representatives of the island in a foiled effort to 
adversely affect opposition contenders in the electoral campaign. 
  Miguel Martinez, Cuba's acting charge d'affaires in this 
capital, said in statements [words indistinct] during a meeting 
he held yesterday with him. 
  Martinez said he asked to meet with Mulino following the 
publication of an alleged report from the Cuban Embassy on 
activities to support the opposition Democratic Revolutionary 
Party [words indistinct], a favorite to win next Sunday's 
elections. 
  Our position is to state very clearly that it is a false 
document. Cuba has not been involved in, nor will it be 
involved in the electoral campaign, and it will not support any 
of the parties participating in the same, Martinez asserted. 
  Martinez said he told the Panamanian foreign minister of his 
concern because irresponsible actions of this kind could 
endanger relations between the two nations. 
  The incident has been widely publicized since last Tuesday, 
when progovernment Legislator Leo Gonzalez held a surprising 
news conference and said he had documents implicating Cuban 
diplomats in alleged illegal actions, although he refused to 
provide details on the origin of his information. 
  The head of the Cuban mission here explained that the 
existence of the reports, which are completely false, was 
reported to him by a top Panamanian official, Antonio Dominguez, 
director of the National Immigration Department. 
  Dominguez even told the local press he had received an offer 
from persons he did not identify who wanted to sell him the 
documents for approximately $20,000. 
  Meanwhile, Martinez indicated that since he learned of 
[words 
indistinct] to manipulate in a specific manner the Cuban 
position, he presented the Foreign Ministry on 26 April with 
evidence showing the falsity of the alleged official Cuban 
documents. 
  [Words indistinct] cited the cheap forgeries of diplomats' 
signatures and a word choice and style completely different from 
the Cuban style, even the use of typical Panamanian expressions 
and phrases.

  [Text] Havana, 4 May (PL) -- Today, Cuba and Colombia 
signed agreements to broaden their bilateral cultural and 
educational cooperation at the closing of Colombian Foreign 
Minister Noemi Sanin's visit to this capital. 
  Sanin and her Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina signed and 
exchanged documents that ratified the existing cultural and 
educational agreement and signed another agreement by which the 
two governments agreed to recognize higher education studies and 
degrees earned in the two countries. 
  PRENSA LATINA learned that Juan Luis Mejia, director general 
of the Colombian Institute of Culture, will travel to Havana to 
sign a program that will establish the specific activities to be 
developed in the cultural area. 
  The ceremony took place at the Cuban Foreign Relations 
Ministry shortly after the visitors met briefly with Marcos 
Portal, basic industry minister, and Conrado Martinez Corona, 
director of the National Sports, Physical Education, and 
Recreation Institute. 
  Among the activities of the Colombian foreign minister were 
a 
working breakfast with Jose Ramon Balaguer, member of the 
Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, and a visit to the 
National Library and the House of the Americas. 
  During these two visits, the minister donated books and 
artwork from her country in the company of Cuban Culture 
Minister Armando Hart. 
  As part of her tight schedule in Cuba, Sanin also met with 
Vice President Carlos Lage; parliament President Ricardo 
Alarcon; and Abel Prieto, president of the National Cuban 
Writers and Artists Union.

<F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 4 Apr [month as received] (PL) -- Cuba and 
Colombia have seen a significant increase in bilateral actions. 
With the latest agreements signed, these actions will increase 
further, mainly in trade, cultural cooperation, and science and 
technology. 
  Two recent examples are Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi 
Sanin's visit to the island and today's signing of documents 
authorizing the recent resolutions of the mixed commission that 
met in this capital last month to establish new cultural and 
educational agreements. 
  In the first semester of 1994, a monumental effort by the 
two 
Latin American countries led to a decision to work together on a 
number of projects in public health, cattle and farming, energy, 
and cultural and educational exchanges. 
  Likewise, in the metallurgical, the iron and steel, 
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and construction materials 
industries, common interests were found which could result in an 
important increase in the total volume of bilateral trade. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Jesus Martinez Beaton, the 
Cuban ambassador in Bogota, referred to current negotiations on 
the eventual supplying of crude oil to the island, as well as to 
increasing trade between the two countries. 
  Martinez said that following the agreement under which 
Colombia would accept Cuban products in payment for a debt of 
approximately $40 million, a list of products was exchanged upon 
which broader future trade relations could be based. 
  Martinez said the possible sale of Colombian hydrocarbons to 
Cuba is being studied, as are methods of payment, shipment, and 
other issues common to trade negotiations. This was confirmed 
by Foreign Minister Sanin upon her arrival in Havana. 
  The ambassador was optimistic about advances in Colombian 
and 
Cuban trade relations and emphasized visits to Cuba in recent 
months by the South American nation's ministers of mines and 
energy, health, and agriculture, the result of which was the 
signing of trade agreements in each area. 
  In the case of Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo, it 
was revealed recently that during his stay in Havana an 
agreement was reached on joint ventures in fishing, 
phytosanitation norms, biological control of plagues, and the 
marketing of veterinary and farming products. 
  Another result of the conversations held by Ocampo was the 
decision by a delegation of Colombian sugar cane and coffee 
growers associations to visit Cuba in June to discuss joint 
ventures with their Cuban counterparts. 
  Ambassador Martinez said that this month a large delegation 
of Colombian investors will visit Cuba for a first-hand study of 
areas for possible joint ventures with the Caribbean state.

Aeronautics Institute described as an "act of air piracy" the 
hijacking to Miami of a Cubana de Aviacion flight (CUB-9100) 
with several passengers on board. 
  In a press note released in this capital, the institute said 
the passengers of the hijacked plane, which was covering the 
Havana-Nassau route, were transported to their destination from 
that U.S. city. 
  The official note said the AN-24 airplane returned to Havana 
with the rest of the crew, and confirmed that the plane was 
hijacked yesterday by pilot Basilio Garcia Breto.

  [Text] Washington, 3 May (PL) -- Today, U.S. President 
William Clinton cited world security, economic reactivation, and 
favoring democracy among the priorities of U.S. foreign policy. 
Appearing on a televised conference organized by CNN at the 
network's Atlanta headquarters, Clinton referred to the current 
areas of tension, specifically in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Haiti, and 
the South African elections, among other topics. 
  He said the possibility of military intervention in Haiti 
must not be ruled out, although, according to him, the United 
States is doing everything possible to avoid having to resort to 
that option. 
  Obviously justifying a possible decision of that sort, 
Clinton said Washington will not meddle in the affairs of other 
countries, but Haiti is a "case by itself," he explained. He 
said U.S. policy consists of doing everything possible to stop 
the killings and to restore democracy in Haiti, noting that that 
position will be rigorously upheld. 
  Regarding events in Bosnia, the U.S. President said Atlantic 
Alliance aircraft will intervene if the Serbs resume aggressions 
against the UN-protected territory, in an action seeking to halt 
the war and promote negotiations, he said. He came out against 
lifting the sanctions imposed on Serbia until such time the 
efforts for a peaceful solution begin. 
  He hailed the negotiation process between Israel and the 
PLO, 
which secured an agreement on Palestinian autonomy over Gaza and 
Jericho. He said that assistance to the tune of $2 million, 
which he considered a good figure to start off with, will be 
sent to Jericho. 
  Asked about the results of the South African elections, the 
number one resident of the White House assessed the possibility 
of aiding the economic development of that country, which 
because of its capabilities hold a key role on the African 
Continent. 
  He formally announced that $5 million will be sent to 
Rwanda, 
but did not say if the measures applied to Somalia will be 
feasible for Rwanda. 
  Regarding the Middle East, today, Clinton said there are 
more 
possibilities of peace to guarantee the territorial integrity of 
Lebanon and to rid it of terrorism. 
  Asked about North Korea, Clinton stressed that "we want to 
have open and friendly relations with Pyongyang and want it to 
have a constructive relationship with South Korea." He 
reiterated that Washington hopes North Korea will respect its 
commitments in matters of nuclear proliferation and noted that 
the solution is now "in the hands of Pyongyang." 
  After making a brief analysis of ties between China and the 
United States over the past two decades, he said that this 
coming month, Washington will work arduously to smooth out 
differences between the two nations. In this sense, he 
mentioned the human rights situation in China, a topic of 
dispute between the two countries. He hailed the UN Security 
Council statement on making peacekeeping operations more 
effective and less costly.

  [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban Deputy Foreign 
Minister Isabel Allende said the number one priority of her 
country's government is to have the embargo lifted. She said 
the embargo imposed by the U.S. Government violates 
international law. 
  During a meeting with 142 U.S. citizens here visiting as 
members of the 25th contingent of the Venceremos Brigade, 
Allende said: "Voting against the embargo means voting for 
adherence to international law." 
  Allende explained Cuban diplomacy's main goals and 
underscored the Cuban Government's efforts to survive despite 
the crisis, adapting to new global realities while keeping the 
achievement of the past 35 years in sight. 
  Referrring to the people's right to free education and 
health, a home, and defense of national sovereignty and 
independence, she said: "Cuba must adapt itself to the world, 
seek ways to survive. We must and will change but while 
preserving the basic achievements of socialism." 
  Pointing out the negative effects of U.S.'s coercive 
measures, she said nine out of 10 business deals with foreign 
enterprises fail because of Washington's pressures. But she 
sounded optimistic because the embargo has been rejected twice 
by the United Nations. 
  In this connection, the deputy minister said another of 
Cuba's priorities is stimulating foreign investment, not for 
business' sake alone but to help spread a true image of the 
local situation so as to offer incentives and guarantees to 
foreign investors. 
  She also said Cuba saw the effects of the embargo alleviated 
by the country's ties with the now defunct Socialist bloc and 
the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, ever since 1989 Cuba has lost 
three-fourths of its most important markets and outside sources 
of financing, to all of which is added the aggravation of the 
embargo via the Torricelli amendment. 
  Among the Foreign Ministry's most immediate goals, Allende 
mentioned working so Cuba can never again be accused of human 
rights violations. To this end, the issue must be 
depoliticized. It is necessary to show that the embargo is the 
first and foremost violator of human rights. 
  Attention to emigration, agreed upon during the recent 
conference between the government and expatriates, is another 
priority, designed to depoliticize ties with this sector, 
keeping it separate from disagreement with the United States.

  [Text] Havana, 5 May (PL) -- Today, the daily GRANMA 
carries a decree-law empowering the government to confiscate 
goods "resulting from theft, speculation, and diverting 
resources," as was announced over the weekend during a meeting 
of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]. 
  Decree-Law No. 149 establishes the "confiscation and 
appropriation by the Cuban State, without any right to 
compensation, of goods and income acquired by persons who have 
increased their assets through the black market or the illegal 
purchase or sale of goods and products. 
  The legislation seeks to stop money hoarders, called macetas 
here (from the Spanish word mazo that means wad, referring to 
the wads they hoard by exploiting the shortage of goods and 
services caused by the economic crisis Cuba has been 
experiencing since early this decade). 
  The measure is part of an economic reactivation plan that 
was 
outlined during an extraordinary meeting of the ANPP held last 
weekend. The plan also seeks to eliminate an excess of currency 
of over 11 billion pesos (equivalent to the dollar at the 
official exchange rate) and a budget deficit of over 4 billion 
pesos. 
  The decree-law, which contains nine articles, orders the 
confiscation of ill-gotten goods from the "owner or holder" and 
the investigation of owners and those who appear to be covert 
owners. 
  The Republic's Attorney General and Finance Ministry will be 
the institutions tasked with conducting the investigation and 
confiscation [words indistinct] according to the law that voids 
the legal force "of actions taken to hide the improper nature of 
the acquisition of goods and income" in question.

<F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 5 May (PL) -- Cuba took a new step today in 
its national offensive against any type of criminal activity by 
enacting the decree-law that calls for the confiscation of goods 
and assets obtained through illegal enrichment. 
  The official provision, which was published this morning in 
the newspaper GRANMA, reflects the decision adopted by the 
National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament) [ANPP] 
this month, charging the Council of State with adopting 
exemplary measures against those who acquire property illegally. 
  Popular protests, staged by worker meetings throughout the 
country, and popular condemnation reported by the media demanded 
stiff sanctions for speculators and those responsible for 
exploiting state funds. 
  Also, it was demanded that money hoarders [macetas], 
individuals who, through their participation in illegal ventures 
and black market activities, get rich and negatively affect the 
interests of society in general, be dealt with sternly. 
  The decree-law provides for the confiscation and 
expropriation by the Cuban State of the goods and properties, 
without any right of indemnification to persons who, directly or 
through third parties, increase their possessions illegally in 
amounts beyond their normal income. 
  The confiscation process will be directed against property 
owners, holders, or bearers of the goods and assets, including 
third parties who benefited from them and who, in a simulated 
manner, appear to be owners. 
  One of the articles states that any resolution of this type 
cannot be appealed and will be turned over to the public 
prosecutor, who will determine what measures will be taken to 
confiscate goods or properties, provided sufficient elements are 
available following the pertinent investigations. 
  Among the final provisions is the determination that the 
decree-law's implementation will be retroactive, given its 
relation to social, public, and national needs. 
  One of the most obvious expressions of the criminal acts 
that 
will deserve sanction is the illegal sale of houses and 
vehicles, an action which has been detected of late and was 
denounced during the ANPP sessions and in worker meetings. 
  A recent meeting of the presidents of the Provincial 
Administration Councils, local power organizations, concluded 
that hundreds of vehicles and thousands of motorcycles, which 
were sold as incentives to manual and intellectual workers, 
wound up in the hands of money hoarders through illegal 
operations. 
  The illegal sale of such vehicles was carried out, 
disregarding the initial sale contracts signed, which 
established that the state has the right of preference to buy 
them if the owner decides to sell. 
  Similar instances occurred with many homes, violating the 
existing principle that the right of personal property does not 
authorize its use as a means of enrichment because the country's 
objective is to satisfy family needs, providing a home to 
whomever needs it. 
  With the decree-law, the government also responded to the 
reiterated demand of the people that harsh penalties be meted 
out to black market speculators, who sell staples at exorbitant 
prices, many times obtaining the products from cooperatives or 
state entities. 
  It was explained that investigations will be carried out by 
competent organizations before the established sanctions are 
applied in order to prevent injustices. It was noted that, 
above all, the people must remain watchful in the process to 
combat criminal actions.

  [Text] Havana, 5 May (PL) -- The positive signs following 
implementation of the Cuban budget during the first months of 
the year will make possible a reduction of the current deficit, 
which amounts to 1 billion pesos (the official exchange rate is 
one peso per dollar), should these indicators remain the same. 
This statement was included in an analysis Finance and Prices 
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez presented to the recent meeting of 
the presidents of the Provincial Administration Councils 
[Consejos de Administracion Provinciales], the local 
authorities' administrative institutions. 
  Rodriguez told the Chamber of Representatives, which opened 
its session in this city, efforts at the provincial levels are 
being made to contribute to the reduction of the national 
deficit, which was estimated at 4.2 billion pesos in late 1993. 
  The minister said this encouraging sign is based on the 
implementation of the budget during the first part of the year. 
He added the budget includes more revenues, less expenditures, 
and a 6.1-percent reduction in the estimated budget deficit. 
  Rodriguez also praised the aggressive efforts by the 
provincial and national cities regarding collections and 
payments because these efforts allowed for a reduction of 440 
million pesos in accounts payable of the first quarter of 1994. 
  The finance and prices minister said [words indistinct] to 
prevent past financial irregularities, for instance, the 
noncollection of debts, from happening again in the country.

  [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Cuba is preparing to exert 
itself to the utmost and achieve better results in the current 
sugar harvest, within the framework of a national effort the 
priorities of which also include placing the economy on sound 
footing. 
  The immediate goal of that effort, according to an editorial 
published today by the weekly TRABAJADORES, is to combine during 
May and June the cutting and processing of all the available 
sugar cane with a sowing effort that has been termed colossal, 
as well as to carry out extensive cleaning of the sugar cane 
fields before spring. 
  In an effort to use existing manpower to its maximum 
capacity, men and machinery will be transferred from various 
provinces to other territories so that they can complete the 
harvest in their places of operation, to cutting down and 
processing all of the sugar cane. 
  The newspaper, published by the Central Organization of 
Cuban 
Trade Unions [CTC], explained that this will be a concerted 
effort among forces and teams that have achieved the highest 
yield and discipline. It will include tens of thousands of 
workers, while other contingents will devote themselves to 
sowing, fertilizing, and manual cutting. 
  The newspaper tells the country that it is necessary to win 
in the current sugar cane harvest and adds that the goal is to 
surpass the last harvest's production by several thousand tons, 
thus starting the agriculture industry's recovery. 
  Decisions on these matters are occurring at the same time as 
deputies of the National Assembly of the People's Government 
(parliament) are discussing the general guidelines of a package 
of measures designed to end the country's financial imbalance 
and decrease the amount of excess currency in circulation, thus 
restoring the value of salaries. 
  TRABAJADORES says that, aside from being the country's 
leading source of revenue, sugar production is also a measure of 
the country's heartbeat. The current sugar harvest is vital to 
halting what it terms the depression afflicting the national 
economy. 
  It added: This will be an indicator of Cuban capacity for 
countering enormous shortages and difficulties that now exist. 
  Within this strategy, Cuba intends to have within the next 
few years the necessary raw materials to achieve former levels 
of sugar production. But in 1994 it defines its eventual 
success only as a harvest which surpasses that of 1993, which 
was 4.2 million tons. 
  The state of mind which prevails among workers who 
participate in the sugar battle is at its highest, the CTC 
publication's editorial concludes.

<F P=106> [Interview with PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo </F>
Ponce de Leon by F. Orgambides in Mexico City; date not given: 
"They Will Not Succeed in Destabilizing Us"] 
  [Text] Days ago, the Mexican press obtained a photo of 
Ernesto Zedillo shining the shoes of a boy in Guadalajara. The 
item formed part of the electoral campaign, but the aptitude 
with which he wielded the brush showed that the candidate was 
quite an expert in the profession. It happens that Ernesto 
Zedillo, a doctor in economics from Yale University, did indeed 
take to the streets as a shoeshine boy to help finance his 
studies. 
  The interview with EL PAIS was held in Mexico City at the 
headquarters of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the 
organization that has governed Mexico for the last 65 years. In 
this building, there are still photos of the late-lamented Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, most of them draped in black crepe. 
  Zedillo, despite the coldness of the surroundings, put our 
interview on an informal plane, admitting his love for rock 
music and revealing to me the many friends he has in Spain, from 
the worlds of politics and business. Identified with President 
Salinas de Gortari, the man who initiated the modernization of 
Mexico, the PRI candidate at the elections of 21 August is very 
sure he will win. He respects, although he is not yet worried 
about, his most immediate rival, the already historical leader 
of the opposition, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. 
  [Orgambides] Many things have occurred in Mexico since 
January: guerrilla warfare, kidnapping, and a crime shrouded in 
mystery which led to the death of your friend Colosio... 
  [Zedillo] It is true that Mexico is experiencing 
unprecedented events and that all have one thing in common: we 
do not know who is behind them. We are very concerned by that, 
but I am extremely confident that, as time passes, these things 
will become more clear and, as a result, people will regain 
confidence. Despite this, this concern has not prevented our 
country from making progress. 
  [Orgambides] While each of these events pretends to be 
different from the rest, it would appear that the objective is 
the same in each case: to destabilize the government. 
  [Zedillo] I cannot say for certain that there is a 
conspiracy, but many Mexicans have the feeling that someone is 
trying to destabilize the country. Now, I can confirm that they 
will not succeed in destabilizing us. Isolated events cannot 
affect a country as strong as Mexico. 
  [Orgambides] You belong to the generation of change, the one 
that started the transformation of Mexico. Will this continue 
if you become president? 
  [Zedillo] The country, because of its problems and 
circumstances, needs to continue with its transformation. I 
have already said that my government will combine continuity in 
certain areas with strength and renovation in others, and change 
where required. We cannot use a single adjective to 
characterize the political intentions of my future government. 
What is clear is that we will place particular emphasis on 
macroeconomic stability and we will strengthen our social policy 
to make it more ambitious. I also plan to undertake major 
reforms in the fields of justice and national security. 
  [Orgambides] Do you think that there is a degree of contrast 
between a conceptually old party like the PRI and you, the 
technocrats, who have faced up to the modernization of Mexico? 
  [Zedillo] The PRI has an enormous capacity for change and 
one 
of my internal messages was that the party should be seen as an 
organization that is already fully competing with the other 
political forces in the country. Times have changed since the 
PRI dominated Mexican political life and could win without 
making much of an effort. Now, as far as we are concerned, we 
have to do it by sheer hard work, day by day, because Mexico is 
more involved, more diverse, and more demanding. 
  [Orgambides] Do you mean that the reform the PRI needs will 
come about in the short term? 
  [Zedillo] Reform must be a constant process. I am sure that, 
given the way circumstances are changing, the PRI will be able 
to renew itself to lead the way in the progress Mexico is making 
on the democratic level. 
  [Orgambides] Now you, and before you Colosio, promised clean 
elections. What are you going to do to ensure this? 
  [Zedillo] Many things. Firstly, we are encouraging our party 
to establish a consensus for better election legislation. 
Second, we have requested real action to be taken, such as the 
external auditing of the electoral roll. We are working in 
tandem with the rest of the parties to ensure that there no one 
has any suspicions about the election officials. Mexico will 
have an institutionalized electoral organization in which the 
PRI will be one more voice, and an electoral roll comparable 
with the best in the world. The Mexican voters, on the other 
hand, will for the first time have to turn up to federal 
elections with an identity document bearing their photograph. 
  [Orgambides] There is a problem of credibility in Mexico. 
What would happen if you win the elections and a major section 
of the population does not believe it? 
  [Zedillo] Credibility has to be built up in a progressive 
way. We do not have to wait until 21 August to see for ourselves 
what has already happened and I am sure we will win the majority 
of the vote. I have publicly encouraged the media and 
independent organizations to carry out opinion polls that, over 
the coming months, will show the electoral preferences of the 
Mexican people. As a result, on the day of the elections, 
people will see that a lot of effort and the progressive 
accumulation of preferences have worked in my favor. 
  [Orgambides] President Salinas has said many times that 
Mexico has already changed its mentality, but we see that the 
people lately have lost their illusions. 
  [Zedillo] We can make out distinct moments in our country's 
recent history. With President Salinas, we have witnessed a 
major process of national renewal that led to the reawakening of 
hope in the Mexican people because the country's serious 
economic problems have been resolved. Now Mexico is going 
through a worrying time because of the violent events that have 
occurred in the last four months and over which the government 
has had no control. If one thing is really clear at the moment 
it is that the people want social peace and Mexican unity. The 
PRI can guarantee them that. 
  [Orgambides] They say that you, Salinas's men, paid so much 
attention to macroeconomic issues that you forgot that there are 
16 million people in Mexico living in extreme poverty. 
  [Zedillo] That is not true. Six years ago, the country's 
most serious problem was the risk of hyperinflation. This would 
have caused the contraction of the economy, the destruction of 
work, and, above all, it would have had a very negative effect 
on the poor. The first problem was how to eliminate our foreign 
debt and thus the lack of control over public finances. 
Salinas, when he promoted his policy of stabilization and 
economic modernization, also set out an extremely ambitious 
social policy. I know that for sure because, as the then-Plan 
and Budget Secretary I had to balance the national budget and at 
the same time increase by 100 percent social expenditure in real 
terms. 
  [Orgambides] Are you afraid of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas? 
  [Zedillo] Absolutely not. I am very confident that I will 
not only beat him but I will also beat all the other candidates. 
Everyone aspiring to the presidency deserves my greatest 
respect, but I sincerely believe that the majority of the 
Mexican people will vote for me. 
  [Orgambides] What if they do not accept your victory? 
  [Zedillo] That is not my problem. The main thing is that the 
election must be clean, every vote must count and count well. 
The people will decide. In any case, I am confident that 
Cardenas and the other candidates will respect the law. 
  [Orgambides] These days, Mexico is a trading partner of 
Canada and the United States. Do you think that this new 
relationship could entail some cultural damage? 
  [Zedillo] The reciprocal influences on the cultures of other 
countries is an inherent phenomenon of communication. The North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will not make this 
situation any worse. As Carlos Fuentes would say, it is the 
North Americans who should be concerned by too great a Mexican 
influence. 
  [Orgambides] In recent years, Spain and Mexico have enjoyed 
excellent relations. What plans do you have in this respect 
when you become president? 
  [Zedillo] Spain is a very special country for Mexico. The 
Spanish and Mexican peoples identify greatly with one another. 
The members of my generation are very gratified to see that our 
foreign relations -- as well as extending into North America -- 
are drawing increasingly closer to Spain. Thus I propose, when 
I am president, not just to ensure closer relations but also to 
strengthen these ties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Efrain Goldenberg by Sara </F>
Gandolfi in Milan; date not given: "Shining Path Is Alive, But 
We Will Make It Repent" -- first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA 
SERA introduction] 
  [Text] Peruvian President Fujimori is launching "operation 
smile." The objective: getting Europeans to forget the 
authoritarian winds which blew across Peru and to relaunch the 
image of a Peru where there is still everything to gain. 
Freshly appointed Prime Minister Efrain Goldenberg will reap 
the first fruits today, with the signing of a framework 
agreement with our government to promote Italian overseas 
investments. "We offer total economic and social stability, 
with no bureaucratic barriers, and no prohibited sector," 
Goldenberg promised, reeling off the figures of Peru's 
ultra-liberal rebirth: Inflation has shrunk from 7,650 percent 
in 1990 to 20 percent (forecast) this year, and in 1993 GDP 
growth reached 7 percent, "the highest figure on the American 
continent." Not to mention the grand privatization plan. Peru 
is selling everything, from telephones to airlines. Within the 
year, it will also be auctioning its little jewel of the Andes, 
the miniature train which runs from Cuzco to Machu Picchu, 
passing alongside the peaks of the Cordillera. 
  [Gandolfi] The economic framework is rosy, but the 
international community is concerned at the military's influence. 
  [Goldenberg] The president, as the Constitution states, is 
the supreme head of the Armed Forces. He carries out this duty 
in complete freedom, as he has demonstrated several times since 
1990. I can assure you that in Peru, the commander in chief is 
Fujimori. 
  [Gandolfi] But your predecessor is said to have resigned 
over 
concessions made to the Armed Forces, in particular the decision 
to have the officers involved in the assassination of nine 
university students and a Lima professor tried by a military 
court. Do you feel that you are in a difficult position? 
  [Goldenberg] No, military courts are part of our legal 
system. In the case in point, three powers of state were 
involved: Congress, a sovereign Congress elected by the people, 
which issued a law; the executive, which did not place a veto; 
and finally the judiciary, which is autonomous and independent, 
and which decided the case should be tried by the military 
court. Three powers of state could have changed this decision, 
but none of them did so. For you, does this make the system a 
ward of the military? 
  [Gandolfi] Peru will manage, therefore, to convince the 
United States, which has threatened to block economic aid, that 
Fujimori will respect human rights? 
  [Goldenberg] It is not our problem to convince the United 
States, nor any other country. We are acting in the sole 
interests of Peru. When it comes to human rights, the state 
guarantees these fully. In Peru, there has been a single major 
violator of human rights, and that has been terrorism. The two 
movements which have done everything possible to destroy Peru, 
which are responsible for the death of 27,000 people and for 14 
years of terror. In the state's counteroffensive, there have 
been sporadic cases of violation by the police. But every time 
such a situation is reported, it is investigated, it is judged, 
and the culprits are severely condemned, as in the case which 
you referred to earlier. 
  [Gandolfi] Fujimori has succeeded in capturing Shining Path 
chief Abimael Guzman, but the guerrilla war continues. How will 
you defeat them? 
  [Goldenberg] They are not guerrillas. They are terrorists, 
criminals of the worst kind. In Peru, the witness protection 
program has been a big success. It allows everyone who want to 
stop being a terrorist and to collaborate with the forces of 
justice to reintegrate into society. In recent months, more 
than 4,000 former terrorists have come forward. This is a major 
success. There are still active terrorists, and we are 
combating them with all the weapons which the Constitution 
allows us to use. Massive military and police operations are 
under way in the northeast, in zones dominated by drugs 
trafficking where there is a strong terrorist presence. There 
are at least several hundred of them. 
  [Gandolfi] Guzman has repented and is providing information? 
  [Goldenberg] He is not part of the witness protection 
program. It is not a pardon for someone who has been captured 
and condemned. 
  [Gandolfi] Rumors are going around that one of Fujimori's 
opponents in the 1995 elections will be former UN Secretary 
General Perez de Cuellar. Does this worry you? 
  [Goldenberg] As far as I know, neither de Cuellar, nor 
Fujimori has announced that he is standing. De Cuellar is an 
illustrious Peruvian, who is entitled to put himself forward 
just like many others. 
  [Gandolfi] Would he make a good president? 
  [Goldenberg] No comment.

  [Text] Quito, 5 May (NOTIMEX) -- An Andean Group 
presidential meeting scheduled for late May in the Ecuadoran 
city of Cuenca has been postponed until next year, official 
sources reported today. 
  Jose Vicente Maldonado, the Ecuadoran minister of industry, 
commerce, and integration, said that the foreign ministers of 
the Andean Group (Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and 
Venezuela), will study a new date for the summit. Maldonado 
ruled out that possible differences among group members, 
especially on trade issues, were the reason for postponing the 
presidential meeting. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Diego Paredes confirmed the 
suspension of the Cuenca summit and added that it will take 
place in "the first half of 1995." He said that the Andean 
Group presidents are interested in directly promoting 
subregional integration, but the meeting in Cuenca was postponed 
due to various commitments they have in the coming weeks. 
  The presidential meeting in Cuenca, third most important 
city 
in Ecuador, would have been held on 26 May, on occasion of the 
25th anniversary of the signing of the Cartagena Agreement that 
gave birth to the Andean Group.

  [Text] The Paraguayan Government -- through the National 
Antidrug Secretariat (Senad) -- is coordinating drug enforcement 
in the Southern Cone. This was announced on 6 May by Brigadier 
General Ramon Rosa Rodriguez (retired), the Senad executive 
secretary. He highlighted the key aspects that Argentina, 
Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Bolivia, and our country will consider 
in fight against trafficking. 
  Rodriguez said: "The first measure we took was to open a 
channel of international communications in the Southern Cone. 
We have thus adopted a positive line of action to 
internationalize the struggle against trafficking." 
  He expounded the plan of action followed by Southern Cone 
countries as of the 12th International Conference on Drug 
Control held in Quito, Ecuador. 
  On that occasion, Rodriguez was elected drug enforcement 
coordinator for the Southern Cone. 
  "We will take positive lines of action. We attended a 
meeting sponsored by the OAS in Mar del Plata [Argentina] three 
months ago and, in my view, the presentations by the different 
representatives were lacking in strength," he said. 
  "It all ended in expressions of goodwill, brotherhood, and 
the like. Now, through the communications channel, we have 
established an action mechanism. Any Southern Cone country will 
now have recourse to another by fax, telephone, or other 
mechanism at hand to ask for help or to exchange information," 
he explained. 
  The plan's second point deals with the furthering of the 
regionalization process by member countries. Rodriguez noted 
that "Southern Cone countries have pledged to participate in 
joint operations at least once a year." 
  "This does not mean that we will work in other countries. 
Each country will pursue an established and coordinated task 
according to its possibilities," he said. 
  Rodriguez added: "We are interested in two things: 
Marijuana, 
our number one problem, and cocaine, which we must combat on 
account of an international commitment. We can now receive 
direct aid -- without much red tape -- through the 
communications channel. This means that aid must be granted to 
any country in the region that requests it." 
  Another subject Rodriguez broached pertains to the legal 
framework, which in his view, partly favors drug enforcement and 
partly does not. 
  "This is quite a broad subject. The seizure of 2 kg of 
cocaine from some Japanese citizens, who offered police 
personnel a $10,000 bribe and were released by a judge from the 
Caaguazu area after a week in jail, is just one example," he 
noted.

  [Text] The traditional disagreement between neoliberals and 
ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean] 
members has become a thing of the past. ECLA, which also 
promoted protectionism and questioned economic opening, is now 
speaking the language of deregulation that all Latin American 
countries now use. 
  Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos said this during 
the closing of ECLA's 25th period of sessions in Cartagena. 
According to Santos, "today ECLA regains its relevance by 
tuning into contemporary trends and tackling issues that are 
part of the economic and political agenda in each and everyone 
of our countries." 
  In the official's opinion, ECLA thus regained its influence 
over Latin America during the Cartagena meeting. "In grasping 
the urgency of incorporating our countries into major 
contemporary trends of commerce and heading with renewed energy 
into the struggle against poverty, ECLA is again feeling the 
heartbeat of major Latin American issues," he said. 
  In his opinion, the new ECLA faces the challenge of 
establishing economic guidelines in order to avoid at all costs 
continuing conditions that could foster violent social 
confrontations. The minister indicated that there are three 
priority topics on the agenda of all the Latin American and 
Caribbean countries: begin integration and productive 
modernization, and forge links between all social topics and 
policies. 
  He thinks that the region now faces the challenge of 
emerging 
from a dangerous dilemma: it cannot compete with high production 
in terms of its labor force (like China, India, and Pakistan), 
neither can it compete in terms of the sophistication of its 
products, since it lacks design and high tech capabilities. 
  "If we do not overcome this dilemma, we will continue to 
lose 
importance in the world market," Santos noted in disclosing that 
Latin America's participation in total worldwide exports has 
gone from 7.7 percent in 1960 to 5.5 percent in 1985 and 3.7 
percent in 1992. This is a matter of raising the countries' 
productivity by incorporating the most advanced processes and 
systems. Once greater value-added status is achieved, the 
economy becomes less vulnerable to the fluctuations of 
international markets. 
  "We cannot choose a strategy of competing with low wages at 
the expense of the impoverishment of our peoples or at the 
expense of artificially stimulating an undervalued exchange 
rate, which ultimately constitutes another reflection of the 
same impoverishment," the foreign trade minister indicated. 
  Santos feels that to achieve modernization it is necessary 
to 
have policies within companies and through government action to 
create the adequate infrastructure, in addition to seeking 
greater efficiency in the financial market and making a big 
effort in education and training projects for the labor force. 
Area countries also have to strive to make multilateral 
agreements adjust to the idea of establishing a hemispheric free 
trade zone. 
  Santos reported that at the end of the incumbent 
government's 
term Colombia will have free trade agreements with 22 countries. 
He pointed to the open integration approach through which they 
have been reached, namely, allowing other countries to join. 
  "The Free Trade Agreement (TLC) can become a tool for 
regional integration," Santos indicated, referring to its 
characteristic as a broad agreement that includes topics other 
than commercial ones and that allows new countries to join. The 
big task of the area countries is to include social topics in 
the processes of economic opening and modernization. 
  "The challenge that emerges in this process of change is 
establishing this new relation with the rest of the world in 
order to become a true source for growth and well-being," Santos 
noted. The idea is for the benefits of the new economic model 
to be distributed equitably. 
  According to the foreign trade minister, "ECLA's overall 
approach, which establishes that it is impossible to separate 
economic and social policies, and its insistence on the 
importance of the concept of equity when discussing economic 
transformation, is precisely the kind of balance we want to 
reach in Colombia."

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Gisela Bel Heredia via </F>
telephone from Accra, Ghana -- live] 
  [Excerpt] Good morning from Accra, Ghana, to all our 
listeners. I want to tell you that Commander in Chief Fidel 
Castro will be leaving for South Africa this morning to 
participate in the inauguration of President-elect Nelson 
Mandela tomorrow. 
  Fidel Castro arrived in Accra at 2230 and was welcomed by 
his 
friend Jerry Rawlings who gave him a hearty, friendly embrace at 
the foot of the stairs as Castro deplaned at the international 
airport. Castro and Rawlings then left for Rawlings' guest house 
and had a long talk there, during which they discussed bilateral 
and international matters, as well as Cuba's current situation. 
I believe that because of the two presidents' admiration for the 
South African cause and for President-elect Mandela, South 
Africa is also a main point of their conversation. 
  Relations between Cuba and Ghana have been very close over 
the past few years, especially since Jerry Rawlings' has been in 
office. Rawlings has visited Cuba twice: in 1979 to attend the 
sixth summit of the nonaligned countries and again in 1989, when 
he carried out a broad program of activities that included 
participating in the 26 July celebrations in Cienfuegos Province. 
  The two countries have also adopted, at different 
international forums, common positions on just causes, when 
firmness and willingness were indispensable, for facing up to 
great enemy pressures. 
  Here in Ghana, Cuban cooperation has been noted in the 
spheres of health and education, among others, which strengthens 
our relations and spirit of cooperation. Also, dozens of young 
Ghanaians are studying in Cuba. 
  Presidential delegation members Roberto Robaina, Ricardo 
Alarcon de Quesada, and Rosa Elena Simeon met with Cuban 
personnel here and learned about their work in Ghana. Also, the 
delegation members reported on the main activities taking place 
in our country. 
  We are now ready to leave for Pretoria, South Africa, where 
the Cuban delegation is to participate in Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration. Many officials here in Ghana said Fidel could not 
be absent from such a significant event in South Africa. The 
Cuban ambassador to Ghana told us this, and that the presence of 
the Commander in Chief in South Africa is greatly appreciated.

a message to Mandela. The text of the message highlights the 
happiness of the Cuban people with the creation of a democratic, 
multiracial government headed by an antiapartheid leader. Castro 
expressed Cuba's willingness to establish diplomatic relations, 
as well as to assist and support the Government of South Africa 
during this new phase.

  [Text] Havana, 8 May (EFE) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
said during an interview with a Barbados television station: "I 
get a kick out of all those rumors about my health; they are 
constantly killing me." The interview was broadcast in its 
entirety today by Cuban television. 
  Jokingly, Castro remarked: "The day I die, my enemies will 
miss me because they will not have anyone to struggle against, 
while my friends will not believe I have died because there have 
been so many false reports of my death before." 
  Fidel Castro, responding to a rumor 15 days ago that said he 
was ill, asserted that his attendance at the conference in 
Barbados on the sustained development of small island states "is 
the best demonstration of my good health." 
  "If one has the capacity to listen to 100 speeches, it is 
because one is in good health because if something can kill you 
it is 100 speeches," the Cuban leader commented in the same 
humorous tone. 
  In addition, Fidel Castro ruled out, for the time being, his 
retirement, "because in difficult times my retirement could 
appear to be a desertion and I am not a deserter." Castro noted, 
"While the people demand I fulfill specific responsibilities, 
regardless of my wishes, I will have to do so, and if I have to 
do this until my last day, I will do it. I have the right as 
anyone else to do as I please with my life. I would like to have 
the right to retire, but one does not retire when one wishes."

<F P=106> [Interview with Commander in Chief Fidel Castro by Caribbean </F>
Broadcasting Union reporter Sharon Marshall in Barbados, date 
not given; Marshall in English with simultaneous translation 
into Spanish; Castro in Spanish with simultaneous translation 
into English -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Marshall] Comandante, your presence here in 
Barbados is an indication of the importance you attach to the UN 
Global Conference. Now that it is over, how would you evaluate 
its success? 
  [Castro] I believe this conference is but the continuation 
of 
the Rio de Janeiro conference. The Rio conference was extremely 
important because it helped build an awareness about 
environmental issues. Politicians are not usually very well 
informed about these issues. I think that for the first time in 
Rio, politicians faced up to the tragedy that degradation of the 
environment means to the world. I would say they were in the 
process of learning at that time, but at this conference, I 
would say there was a greater awareness among the politicians as 
well as a greater awareness among the industrial nations, more 
than in Rio, and in a rather short period of time. 
  Of course, the politicians from the small island states were 
more aware than anyone else at the Rio conference. I remember we 
had acted as contact between members of our delegation and 
representatives of those small islands. They were truly 
anguished over the future prospects for their islands because of 
climatic changes, warming of the atmosphere, the frequency of 
hurricanes, and drought. All these are real phenomena that we 
are witnessing, and they constitute a question of natural life 
or death for these nations. I was able to perceive in Rio that 
they needed something, they needed to strive to obtain some hope. 
  Because they are isolated, these countries also have many 
economic problems. They are small countries, although they have 
large areas of sea. Communications are very difficult. It takes 
over 20 hours to travel from Samoa, near New Zealand; or from 
here to Barbados. It takes over 20 hours of flight. Maritime 
communications are very complicated. They do not have 
communication -- practically none. If a natural phenomenon 
occurs, it is a national disaster. It is not like a hurricane 
hitting Florida. A strong hurricane can hit Florida, but the 
rest of the country is enormous. It does not ruin the country. 
But to a small Caribbean island, a hurricane can mean ruin. 
  To this, we can add the fact that since that hurricane that 
I 
said hit Florida, insurance policies have been going up to 500 
percent. A very adverse combination of factors have been 
affecting these small island states. Moreover, their waters are 
being polluted. They are polluted by petroleum residues spread 
by tankers, and by solid and nuclear wastes. If the Third World 
has a tragedy, the tragedy of these small island states is three 
times greater. This was reflected in the conference. Each and 
every one of them raised its own problems with great 
seriousness. It was really dramatic in some cases the way they 
described their problems, such as with St. Kitts and Nevis, the 
Marshall Islands, and other islands. They said that if the sea 
level rises only three meters, the islands will disappear. They 
addressed the conference with great sincerity and great passion. 
I think they reflected the hope that the world will take care of 
them. I think this conference was very successful, both the 
Barbados Declaration and the action plan. There was a very 
strong appeal, and I observed among the industrialized nations a 
greater awareness, a growing awareness, more than I could 
perceive in Rio. I could perceive some changes in the positions 
of the United States, positions they did not hold in Rio. In 
general, the donor countries have demonstrated more 
understanding. For this reason, I believe a step forward has 
been taken, and this conference will be of great benefit to the 
small islands. 
  [Marshall] But a great deal has been said about the fact 
that 
the industrialized nations, the donor countries, were not highly 
represented. How optimistic are you that small countries will 
get the kind of financial assistance they need to improve their 
situation? 
  [Castro] To the extent that we work, to the extent that we 
denounce all these problems, to the extent that we act upon 
these issues in international forums, and to the extent that we 
try to bring public opinion over to our side, we shall get more 
help. 
  The industrialized countries, as a rule, have not been very 
generous. The famous percentage of gross product they were to 
contribute to development has never been met. There are a few of 
those countries that take more generous positions, countries 
that have provided up to 1 percent of their Gross Domestic 
Product for assistance, but the richest and the more powerful 
ones have not. 
  We must continue striving with the United States and 
hammering on these issues, especially concerning pollution in 
general, and environmental problems because these are not just 
imaginary threats. These are real threats. Our own generation is 
already witnessing how the environment is changing, how the 
waters are warming up, how hurricanes are more intense, droughts 
more intensive. We are all witnessing this. Scientists have 
mathematically proven that this is a reality. But there is 
selfishness. 
  I would like to say something else, if I may. I would say 
that selfishness is intrinsic to the system, to the system that 
is prevailing in the world today, known by the name of 
capitalism. I hope to be forgiven for using this word. This is 
an time of euphoria, but those immensely rich countries are 
doomed to grow. If they do not grow, they fail, they cannot 
survive. But if they grow, they deplete the natural resources of 
the world, and those countries that are just now beginning to 
grow are posing a greater problem because they are not 
increasing the number of jobs. 
  Many of those countries need to grow at a rate of 4 percent 
annually in order to create one job. That is why I consider it a 
system with no future. How can the matter of sustainable 
development be explained if the underdeveloped nations need to 
grow, have the right to grow, while the overindustrialized 
countries do not need more wealth than they already have. What 
they need is to redistribute what they have. We need to defend 
the concept of redistribution of wealth in the world because 
when you think of it, Bangladesh has over 120 million 
inhabitants, and in 20 more years, will have 200 million. It is 
one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and 
with very low land. What will happen to Bangladesh if the sea 
level rises? But there are small nations like Switzerland -- I 
have nothing against Switzerland. It is a country with very 
positive attributes, but it has a gross per capita income of 
$34,000, while Bangladesh has approximately $210. Switzerland 
has a gross per capita income 200 times that of Bangladesh. 
  Why do such wealthy countries need to continue growing? Why 
must the philosophy be one of continuous growth rather than 
better distribution? Why not distribute the wealth of the world 
in a better way, since the world is one big family? Why do they 
not distribute it among the countries that need to develop? They 
cannot continue with this insane race toward development because 
in addition to depleting the natural resources of the world, 
they will also deplete the resources of mankind. Cooperation is 
needed more than ever, and that is something that should be 
said. In the few minutes that I used for my address, I mentioned 
that problem because the differences between rich and poor are 
increasing. For 40 years, we have heard talk about narrowing the 
gap, but that gap has grown; it has widened. 
  It was believed that with the end of the Cold War, the arms 
race would disappear. But the arms race goes on. The great 
powers continue producing sophisticated weapons, and the weapons 
trade continues to grow. The United States has become the major 
weapons exporter in the world. Everyone is manufacturing and 
selling weapons. So wars occur, and the United Nations has to go 
play the role of international policeman and put out the fire. 
Is it not absurd that on the one hand, the United Nations is 
playing the role of world policeman, while on the other hand, 
the weapons trade continues to grow? How can this absurdity be 
explained? 
  These are very serious problems on which we must work 
because 
it is not one single problem. There was no mention of education 
in the world, about famine in the world, about the millions of 
children who are dying every year from curable diseases. 
  Nevertheless, I can assure you that the assembly was very 
successful; it was a very fruitful conference, and Barbados 
certainly played a brilliant role in the organization and 
development of the conference. Barbados deserves the success it 
has experienced at this conference. 
  [Marshall] Your presence here in Barbados is seen as an 
indication of the importance that Cuba attaches to closer 
relations with the rest of the Caribbean. What hopes do you 
harbor for the Association of Caribbean States? 
  [Castro] My presence here is due to several factors. First, 
we had contact with the small island states. I realized how 
anguished they are. They were able to hold an international 
conference to broach these issues. We are also an island nation, 
vulnerable to a significant portion of the problems threatening 
all of us. 
  Then, the prime minister extended an invitation to me, so I 
felt it was my duty to attend this conference. That is why I 
came. I am interested in ties with the Caribbean. It is logical, 
natural. We appreciate that the Caribbean countries were the 
first to breach the blockade against Cuba. These were Guyana, 
Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados. I cannot forget that 
these were the first four countries to challenge U.S. pressures 
and reestablish ties with Cuba. I admire the spirit of 
independence shown by Caribbean countries, I admire their 
efforts towards integration. I like these countries with which 
we share blood and solid historic ties. This is why I felt it 
was my duty to modestly contribute to the conference. 
  Regarding the Caribbean states, we have a need to come 
together. We are stronger if we unite. Divided into dozens of 
small nations, we will not be able to have an influence in the 
world. Through cooperation, integration, we will be able to play 
a role in the world, to the benefit of our countries. 
  [Marshall] Some people argue that Cuba has only turned to 
the 
Caribbean because of the fall of the Soviet Union. How would you 
respond to those charges? 
  [Castro] Go figure. After all these things we have been 
talking about. Relations were reestablished with the Caribbean 
15 years before the collapse of the Soviet Union. We established 
very close ties with Jamaica when Michael Manley became the 
prime minister of Jamaica. We had relations with Guyana since 
Cheddi Jagan, before Forbes Burnham. First there was Cheddi 
Jagan. Then with Burnham, ties developed a great deal more. We 
have had relations with Grenada. We have ties of one kind or 
another with almost every country and have always cooperated 
whenever we could. When they breached the blockade, they 
established ties with Cuba, many years before the collapse of 
the Soviet Union. I have visited several of these nations a long 
time ago -- Jamaica, for instance. 
  Once, I came to Barbados. We were en route to a Nonaligned 
Countries meeting in 1973, 21 years ago. A group of Caribbean 
leaders also traveled on the same plane that has brought us from 
Cuba: Burnham, Barrow, and several other leaders. I believe 
Bishop was also among them. It was a time when no one would have 
dared dream of the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
  So here we are. We have worked with the Caribbean for many 
years. Besides, the Caribbean could not replace the socialist 
bloc, nor our economic relations with the USSR. We are small 
countries. Our ties are historic, cultural, moral; not 
commercial or of an economic nature. Of course, the economy and 
commerce can profit from our relations. A statement of that kind 
is unsubstantiated, however. 
  We also established ties with Africa a long time ago and 
participated actively in Africa's struggles against colonialism 
and neocolonialism. We also fought and cooperated to the maximum 
for the independence of Namibia. We cooperated in the struggle 
against apartheid. Cuban blood was being shed for a long time in 
Africa. We have very strong ties of brotherhood, and they are 
much farther away than the Caribbean. At that time, the USSR and 
other countries existed. Our relationship ties with the African 
nations existed, however. We have ties with Vietnam, the PRC, 
the Middle East, Arab nations, with India, and many others. 
  Given that the United States has always tried to isolate us, 
we have expanded our ties with the rest of the world. Our 
doctors, engineers, and workers have served in dozens of Third 
World countries. We were president of the Nonaligned Countries 
movement in 1979, a long time before the disappearance of the 
USSR. No one developed ties with the Third World more than we 
did. No one has fought for the interests of the Third World at 
the United Nations more than we. No one denounced unequal trade, 
foreign debts, nor the injustices against the Third World as we 
did at every turn. This was the role of Cuba since the triumph 
of the Revolution. We feel truly proud and pleased at having 
discharged that role that no one can deny. 
  [Marshall] You mentioned Morris Bishop. What do you think of 
Bishop and what he was trying to accomplish in Grenada? 
  [Castro] I loved Bishop as a brother. His death and 
disappearance pained and pains me. Bishop was an extraordinary 
man. He was a very honest, noble person. He wanted to do the 
best for his country. We did everything we could to cooperate 
with him. Since it is a small country, we could cooperate. I am 
speaking of Bishop, the person. He had the backing of an 
organization, a party. They divided and we have always condemned 
the attitude assumed by Bishop's adversaries within the party. I 
do not want to overstate my criticism because these are people 
who are in jail, and a basic sense of chivalry forces me to be 
cautious with my words. We strongly condemned however, with the 
utmost irritation, the death, the assassination of Bishop. I 
keep and shall always keep a great memory of him as an 
exceptional, extraordinary man. I should not be the judge of his 
mistakes because we all make mistakes, but I can assure you that 
Bishop tried to do the best he could for his country. That is my 
opinion. 
  [Marshall] April 27 was a great day in South Africa. Some 
people would argue that without Cuba's intervention in the 
liberation struggles in southern Africa, that day would not have 
been possible. Are you proud of the role Cuba has played in 
Africa's liberation struggles? 
  [Castro] That is a delicate subject. We should not be the 
ones speaking about this. We felt, out of our own conviction, as 
a matter of doctrine and revolutionary passion, a great 
solidarity with the whole of Africa and a deep hatred for the 
slavery and historic crimes committed against Africa. All of our 
nations experienced this. Out of a spirit of solidarity, we 
fought and worked for Africa. We gave then all the help our 
small country could provide. We did not have much money, but 
many patriots. 
  When South Africa invaded Angola, we did not hesitate to 
send 
our troops to fight against the racist South African invaders. 
This took place in 1975, almost 20 years ago. Cuba, over 10,000 
km away, sent troops. It was the only country to do this when 
the South Africans were advancing on Angola. The Angolan people 
had just attained their independence and were weak. They fought 
courageously. We fought together, Cubans and Angolans. We 
managed to halt the advance of the South Africans and later push 
them back to the Namibian border. 
  Of course, later on, we began to withdraw, and South Africa, 
with the support of the West, organized counterrevolutionary 
guerrillas and subversive plots. When it felt at its most 
powerful and when the Cuban presence was smaller, it expanded 
its attacks on Angola. We spent 15 years in Angola. I believe it 
is great proof of our loyalty to the Angolan people. 
  That was the reason for our differences with South Africa -- 
our support for Angola. In 1975, we were able to reestablish the 
borders. Years later, as a result of South Africa's actions, the 
situation became complicated once more. This forced us to 
reinforce Angola. More recently however, in around 1987, the 
South Africans launched one of their largest attacks, using 
planes, tanks, and modern artillery. A very difficult situation 
was created. We had two choices -- to withdraw or to reinforce 
our presence. What we did was to play all our cards. We 
reinforced our troops, and then the Cuito Cuanavale battle. 
Angolans and Cubans waged a very difficult battle. In that area, 
we had few communications options. We wanted to halt the South 
Africans there however. 
  What happened in Cuito Cuanavale? Cuito Cuanavale is to the 
east. The communications are very poor there. We did not want to 
wage the decisive battle there, but to resist and keep Cuito 
Cuanavale between us and the Angolans. The Angolans are 
excellent soldiers, outstanding battle comrades. There, we 
managed to halt the South African offensive. Then we organized a 
thrust to the west, where we had better communications. From 
Cuba, we sent every supply required to master the situation. 
  Think about it. Angola is farther from Cuba than Moscow is. 
The flight between Havana and Moscow takes 14 hours. From Havana 
to Luanda, it takes almost 16 hours. Do you know how many men we 
sent? Over 50,000 troops, a small country like Cuba. This does 
not demonstrate our military might, but our moral force, our 
spiritual power. In that struggle, Cuba played all its cards. We 
advanced to the west and got closer to the Namibian border. The 
situation of the war changed. We did not want the war to be 
decided, however, by a large battle at an elevated cost in human 
lives on both sides. The appropriate conditions were created for 
negotiations. We supported the negotiations. Diverse countries 
also supported the negotiations, the South Africans were willing 
to negotiate, and that is how the implementation of Resolution 
435, the independence of Namibia, was achieved. 
  Logically, all those political and military events also had 
a 
bearing on South Africa. I believe, in answering your question, 
that the efforts made helped maintain Angola's independence, 
accelerated Namibia's independence, and also accelerated the 
process of the disappearance of apartheid. It helped. It 
accelerated the process. Anyhow, sooner or later, Namibia would 
have been independent; sooner or later, apartheid would have 
disappeared because apartheid was unbearable in today's world. 
The South African people, like the Namibian, fought long and 
hard, made many sacrifices, and met their goals. 
  I believe they had great leaders. They are a great people, a 
very courageous, militant, strong, intelligent, resourceful 
people. They have achieved this victory. We have to study the 
period following the war, and the time of the elections, the 
extraordinary role played by Mandela -- his leadership, and 
wisdom. He was capable of uniting, overcoming every obstacle, 
remaining firm while resilient, to attain this political miracle 
in which everyone participated, the elections, in which such a 
resounding victory was attained. 
  This was, first of all, a great victory for the South 
African people, a great victory for Africa, the world, and the 
liberal movement. I believe that now, we all have to contribute 
to upholding harmony and peace. We all have to work and struggle 
so that the emerging multiracial state is successful and 
prospers, so that everyone finds safety, and South Africa 
embarks on the long road towards development, a road on which it 
could get very far. 
  South Africa has great natural resources. It is a very 
wealthy nation; yet there is much poverty among most of the 
population. I believe South Africa is destined to play a 
decisive role in Africa. I am convinced they chose the right man 
for that job, a man with talent, wisdom, and patience. I am a 
great admirer of Mandela. Next to everything they did, Cuba's 
modest contribution is nothing but a grain of sand in that 27 
April victory. 
  [Marshall] I would like to turn to your relations with the 
United States. What conditions are necessary, in your opinion, 
for improvement of that situation? 
  [Castro] If we are going to talk seriously, first of all, 
for 
the blockade to end. It is an unfair, harsh, cruel blockade, 
which includes medicines, and foodstuffs. It has been imposed on 
Cuba for 35 years. It is one of the longest blockades in 
history, and the most unjustified of all. 
  Second, the United States must resign itself to the fact 
that 
Cuba is an independent, sovereign country. 
  Third, respect for our people's right to choose the 
political, social, and economic systems they believe most fair. 
These are the three essential factors. We do not have anything 
against the United States. We have not blockaded the United 
States. We do not want to change the U.S. social system. We do 
not seek to establish socialism in the United States. In any 
case, that would be as complicated as establishing capitalism in 
Russia. They must be similar things, given the characteristics 
of each of those two countries. We are therefore not trying to 
rule the United States nor diminish its independence one iota. 
It is not that we have a problem with the United States. It is a 
problem the United States has with us. 
  [Marshall] Cuba recently introduced some economic reforms, 
such as the legalization of foreign currency. What success do 
you believe that has had? 
  [Castro] Success does not come easy. There are very strong 
U.S. pressures. The U.S. blockade is international; it bans not 
only trade with Cuba, but pressures, with all its economic and 
political might, all countries that want to trade with Cuba. 
They try to sabotage and block every economic endeavor Cuba 
conducts abroad. Under those conditions, it is always much 
harder to introduce certain changes and initiatives. Despite all 
that however, we are getting along and there is a growing number 
of people in the world who dare to challenge the influence of 
the United States. We could move much faster without the 
blockade. 
  There have been dramatic changes in the world. We do not 
want 
to relinquish our ideals, do not want to abandon our political 
system. We wish to preserve our Revolution, our independence, 
and the accomplishments of socialism even under the present 
difficult conditions. Sometime ago I used this example: You are 
aboard a ship and the ship breaks apart and sinks. That is what 
happened with the socialist bloc and the USSR. Thus, one has to 
adopt measures, find a lifeboat, find an inner tube or a piece 
of wood, to try to make it ashore. That is what we are doing. 
When the socialist bloc and the USSR vessel sunk....[pauses] The 
entire ship, however, did not sink. The PRC is still a very 
powerful vessel; Vietnam is a very strong vessel; and other 
countries. 
  I give you this example because we are not planning to 
relinquish our ideals. We would rather drown. We prefer to 
perish in our struggle to make it to shore than to renounce our 
ideals. This is what we are doing. The USSR disappeared four 
years ago and Cuba is still standing, alone, confronting, like a 
little David, a colossal giant. There we are and there we are 
planning to remain. Dead or alive, we shall still be there. And 
if our generation is not be victorious, future generations will 
make it. I have absolute certainty, however, that our generation 
will be victorious. 
  [Marshall] Sometime ago you hinted that you might retire. 
How confident are you that the Cuban youth will choose a path 
you would approve of? 
  [Castro] I think you are refering to a question by Sawyer, 
an 
American journalist, who asked me if I was planning to run in 
the next election, and I told her that I wish I would not have 
to, I wish that that would not be necessary. I also said I was 
willing to negotiate everything but the Revolution and Cuba's 
independence. I said that. This was the context in which that 
issue arose. I belive that I have, like any other human being, 
the right to do with my life as I please. I have been a 
revolutionary to this day. I would like to have the right to 
retire whenever I wished. However, we do not retire when we want 
to, but when we are allowed to retire. In other words, we are in 
the government not for the pleasure of being in the government, 
but because it is imposed on us. If we were in normal times, 
everything would be easier. In difficult times, to retire would 
be tantamount to defecting, and I am not a defector, nor will I 
ever be one. As long as my comrades in the party and the 
government, as long as people demand that I discharge certain 
responsibilities, regardless of my personal wishes, I will have 
to fulfill what I am told to do. What I wish for already is 
something else. Government work is very hard, very difficult, 
very bitter, very tense. I do not believe many people want to 
voluntarily take up that job. That work must simply be 
undertaken as a duty. If they demand that I be there until my 
last day, I will do so. If at any time I am given the 
opportunity to regain my freedom, then I would not miss the 
chance to do so. 
  I want to stress that if I can tolerate my work, it is 
because I share it; it is very widely distributed. No man alone 
can do the things you need to do in a Revolution. Tens of 
thousands of people work, more or less in a coordinated fashion. 
A great part of our work is to coordinate and help to coordinate 
work. Not to do the work of others. Work in Cuba is shared. Many 
people do their parts. I also do my small share. In the world, 
there is a trend to believe that there are providential 
individuals who can do everything themselves. Individuals, 
however, can do very little as a person. I truly believe that my 
contribution is modest, and one could say, my work in Cuba is 
basically symbolic. 
  I try to fulfill my role as well as possible, however. 
Recently, as you know, they began to spread rumors abouth my 
health. They have me dead every so often. I do not know who the 
people are who are wishing for my death so intensely. I am 
convinced that the day I am dead, my enemies are going to miss 
me. Do you understand? They are going to find themselves with 
nothing to do. My friends, however, are not going to believe I 
am dead because I have been killed so many times. Yesterday, at 
the conference, certain journalists from Miami kept asking about 
my health and my thoughts on what the local media said about my 
health. To tell the truth, the day before yesterday, I worked 14 
hours. Yesterday, I worked another 14 hours. 
  I listened to every minute of every speech. If someone can 
listen to over 100 speeches, that is ample evidence of good 
health. If anything is able to kill someone, it is 100 speeches 
in a row. [chuckles] The conference has therefore been the best 
evidence of my good health. 
  I do not truly concern myself with that type of propaganda. 
It does not bother or stress me. Rather, I take it with a dose 
of humor and laugh at all those rumors. I already know that I 
will have two great advantages the day I die. What I told you: 
The sorrow of my enemies and the skepticism of my friends. 
  [Marshall] Many years ago, you made a famous speech in which 
you said: History will absolve me. At this distance, in the 35th 
year of the Revolution, do you think it has? 
  [Castro] History is very capricious. You should not believe 
that history is the best judge. I do not know if, on the final 
judgment day, justice will be met, but in this world, it does 
not work that way. What I meant to say was that the ideas I was 
defending were just, and that even under those very difficult 
conditions, in a prison, and being tried, I was sure that it 
would not be those judges, but history that would absolve me. 
  You are asking me a very personal question: What do I think? 
In general, what happens when people die is that they are 
forgotten. Only their closest relatives remember them. Time goes 
by. Many people, however, have lived worrying about history and 
glory. He who has read a little something about world events 
knows that in the end, all the glory of the world -- as Marti 
said -- fits into a kernel of corn. 
  I do not think any glory lasts over 2,000 years except that 
of Christ, or Julius Caesar, or Charlemagne, or other 
personalities from antiquity. No history, however, has lasted 
over 5,000 years. No history has lasted over 10,000 years. No 
history will last 1 million years. No history will last 1 
billion years. When the sun goes out, what history will be left? 
Why worry then about history? I do not worry much about history. 
I ask myself: What is my duty? What should I do? To be honest, 
in my opinion, that worth much more than anything else. To be 
modest is worth more than everything else. To enjoy the 
privilege of having been born to do good is the greatest glory 
anyone can enjoy. This is why I am not thinking, like others: 
what is going to be said about me? What has been said to date is 
enough for me. Some good things and many bad things. In the end, 
people will have to acknowledge that we were steadfast, defended 
our beliefs, our independence, wanted to do justice, and were 
rebellious. 
  David is remembered because he fought against Goliath. 
Cubans 
will be remembered, who are an even smaller David against a much 
larger Goliath; will have to be remembered at least as much as 
David is remembered. 
  If movies are made someplace other than Hollywood, or the 
United States, perhaps a few good movies will be made about the 
Cuban Revolution. [chuckles] 
  [Marshall, in Spanish] Commandante, thank you very much and 
good luck. 
  [Castro] Thank you.

  [Text] Nigerian Ambassador to Havana Y. Alhassan stated 
today in Havana during a news conference that his government 
will maintain its peaceful policy, but will be firm against any 
attack from the Republic of Cameroon. 
  The Nigerian ambassador provided broad information on the 
border conflict between the two countries in the Bakassi 
peninsula zone which has always belonged to Nigeria, as 
confirmed by several treaties, although Cameroon is now 
expressing some designs on this territory. 
  The ambassador added that the strengthening of Nigerian 
forces, to maintain order in that region, has been 
misinterpreted by the neighboring country, which conducted three 
military attacks in February 1994. He added that Nigeria will 
never be the first to attack, but that its armed forces are 
prepared for anything.

  [Text] The Cuban delegation to the Latin American seminar 
on communications media that is taking place in Chile has urged 
media from the continent to report truthfully on the Cuban 
situation. 
  The UPEC [Union of Cuban Journalists] members submitted a 
document to the participants, stating that the main cause of the 
distortion of our country's image is the result of 
miscommunication imposed from abroad. 
  Regarding that isolation policy, the document underscores 
violations in the issuance of visas to travel to the United 
States, which prevented Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina from 
attending a forum recently held by the CNN network in the City 
of Atlanta. 
  The document, submitted by UPEC vice president Jose dos 
Santos, includes an addendum of newspaper articles prepared by 
Cuban reporters from various media on freedom of expression and 
other subjects being discussed in the seminar in Chile.

  [Text] A fee will be charged for the use of underground and 
surface water, through motors and other agricultural implements, 
by the cooperative and farming sector, as part of the measures 
to correct the national financial imbalance. 
  Orlando Lugo Fonte, president of the National Association of 
Small Farmers [ANAP], in a meeting with Villa Clara municipal 
ANAP representatives, clarified doubts and read part of the 
resolution issued by the Cuban Water Resources Institute. Lugo 
Fonte pointed out that the fee for the right to use the water 
will be determined case by case, and will be announced shortly 
in the monthly Farmer's Pride and Honor assemblies, which are 
redoubling their efforts against illegal sales of agricultural 
products.

  [Text] The Antonio Guiteras Electric Plant in Matanzas, 
currently undergoing maintenance, will come on line on 7 May 
before the peak hours of electrical demand. This information was 
reported by plant manager Jesus Valdez Torra. 
  Valdez Torra advised that since 5 May, maintenance has been 
conducted around the clock to conclude repairs to the boiler, 
the gas recirculation system, the generator, and other auxiliary 
equipment. The approximately 120 maintenance workers of the most 
efficient plant in the country are working hard to promptly 
conclude repairs following 124 days of continuous operation. To 
date, the plant has produced approximately 500,000 megawatt 
hours for the National Electric System. It easily fulfilled the 
first quarter's program and by December would have produced over 
2.2 million megawatt hours.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 27 April and 6 
May: 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2220 GMT on 27 April reports that 
workers from Camaguey, in preparation for the harvest, have 
repaired blades for cane combine-harvesters, thus saving more 
than 78,000 pesos. Innovators from Camaguey machine shops are 
overcoming limited resources to repair water pumps and other 
equipment in homage to all workers on 1 May. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 27 April reports that the 
Camilo 
Cienfuegos cane cutters brigade, which has only 10 workers, has 
cut 1 million arrobas of sugarcane in the municipality of 
Calimete, Matanzas Province. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 28 
April 
report that the Baracoa forest brigade, Guantanamo Province, has 
cut 1,200 cubic meters of costly hardwoods. This is not an easy 
task but the workers' willingness surmounts all other things, 
one of the workers said. The brigade will cut an additional 
1,200 cubic meters by 1 May and intends to cut 5,000 cubic 
meters this year. 
  Radio Reloj at 1400 GMT on 28 April reports that the 
cultural 
magazine LA GAZETA DE CUBA is circulating again in an expanded 
64 pages. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2220 GMT on 28 April reports that the 
tomato harvest has "successfully" concluded in Pinar del Rio, 
particularly at Los Palacios Complex where 632,162 quintals have 
been harvested. This is approximately 20,000 quintals more than 
in 1993, although 150 fewer caballerias were planted. Over 70 
percent of the province's tomato harvest was distributed locally 
and in Havana; the rest of the harvest was allocated for 
industrial use. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 29 April reports that the 11 
torula factories of the Sugar Industry Ministry have produced, 
to date, over 43,000 tons of animal feed, or 50 percent of the 
production goal of 1994. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 29 April reports that Cuba's 
largest factory for producing plastic containers was inaugurated 
today. The plant is a joint enterprise established between the 
Spanish firm, (Guimar), and (Biofan). It will produce 60,000 
containers daily with 49 models ranging from 50 milliliters to 
30 liters, which will guarantee the containers needed for many 
exported products. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 30 April reports that Cuba is 
reactivating cigar exports, its seventh main source of income, 
thanks to western credits, mainly from French and Spanish firms. 
The hope is to increase production next year and market Cuba's 
36 name brands in Europe. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 3 May reports that 5,897 
caballerias of sugarcane were planted between January and April, 
meeting the goal despite the "tense" situation with the sugar 
harvest. Camaguey exceeded its goal by almost 300 caballerias, 
followed by Matanzas, Villa Clara, and Ciego de Avila. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 on 4 May reports that workers of the 
gas plant in Cardenas, Matanzas, have produced 2500 bottles of 
methane gas to replace the acetylene used in the steel industry. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 4 May reports that milk 
production has improved in Ciego de Avila Province during the 
first quarter. Dairy farms produced 500,000 [unit not specified] 
more than in the same period of 1993. This production, while 
still low, reached a rate of 3.2 liters per cow by the end of 
March against last year's 2.6 liter per cow. Steps have been 
taken to begin the installation of minidairy farms in Basic 
Cooperative Production Units to provide better care for cattle 
during the current conditions of shortages in feed and other 
resources. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 5 May reports that by the end 
of 
April Matanzas workers have extracted more than 270,000 tons of 
oil from the Varadero deposit. This production surpasses by 4 
percent the established objective, which by the end of December 
contemplates production higher than 800,000 tons, with an 
additional 30,000-ton commitment to the commander in chief. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 5 May reports that San Juan 
Municipality, Pinar del Rio Province, harvested 20,000 quintals 
more tobacco this year in comparison to the same period of 1993. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 0000 GMT on 6 May reports that Pinar 
del Rio Province showed a 40-percent increase in weeding tasks. 
More than 250 caballerias are being prepared for the coming 
planting season. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 6 May reports that during the 
first four months of the year, workers throughout Cuba weeded 
62,000 caballerias, planted 5,900 caballerias, and maintained an 
intense effort in the current sugar harvest. 
  Radio Progreso at 1100 GMT on 6 May reports that Francisco 
Linares, minister of labor and social security, announced there 
are more than 151,130 licensed self-employed workers in Cuba. He 
stated a decree will soon to be issued regulating infringements 
by people of that sector.

  [Text] The historic UN Global Conference on Sustainable 
Development of Small Island Developing States, SIDS, came to a 
close in Barbados at the weekend. The conference has received 
mixed reviews, with the majority of participants describing it 
as having achieved its objective. Among the persons giving the 
conference a plus is Cuban President Fidel Castro, who has 
described it as an important step forward. President Castro's 
comments came shortly before boarding his Cubana aircraft to 
return home. (David Hinckson) tells us more: 
  [Begin recording] [(Hinckson)] President Castro said he was 
feeling very pleased at having been able to get to know 
Barbados. He responded to the question of Cuban interests and 
mutual organizations. He repeated his wish for Cuban 
participation in the Association of Caribbean States. 
  [Castro in Spanish with passage-by-passage translation into 
English] At least we hope to be part of the Association of 
Caribbean States, and we will do everything that will help to 
integrate Cuba into the Caribbean Association so we are part of 
the [word indistinct] region. We have many common interests, so 
it would be very useful, I think, for everybody that Cuba 
integrates through all the [word indistinct]. 
  [(Hinckson)] The Cuban leader also defended his opposition 
to 
military intervention as a solution to the Haitian crisis. This 
[word indistinct] course of action, he said, would affect the 
prestige of exiled leader Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  [Castro in Spanish with passage-by-passage translation into 
English] We would like Aristide to go back to the presidency of 
Haiti, following an absolutely fair situation, absolutely fair 
[repeats] elections. If that country were to be invaded in order 
to return Aristide to his position, Aristide's prestige would 
suffer a great deal because he would be [pauses] his stature as 
a politician would be very much diminished.

  [Excerpt] The seventh session of the legislature ends on 9 
May, and it looks as if this session's final meeting will be 
stormy. National Assembly President Firmin Jean-Louis has 
convened the legislators for 9 May at the Haitian legislature to 
conclude the seventh legislative session but Bernard Sansaricq, 
who claims he is president of the National Assembly, has also 
convened the legislators. Here is a report on this situation by 
Leontes Dorzilme. 
  [Begin recording] [Dorzilme] The parliamentarians of the 
45th 
legislature must meet in national assembly on 9 May in order to 
close the seventh legislative session. The president and 
vice-president of the National Assembly, respectively Senator 
Firmin Jean-Louis and Deputy Robert Monde, officially convened 
this meeting on 6 May. Today, 9 May, eyes remain glued on the 
Legislative Palace where there is much disagreement. 
  Will the elected representatives of the National Front for 
Change and Democracy agree to sit down with the parliamentarians 
elected on 18 January 1993, who are themselves very determined 
to attend the meeting convened by the office presided over by 
Sansaricq? Who will the real president of today's session be? 
No one knows. We have received two convocations in our 
newsroom, issued by the two -- antagonistic -- offices of the 
Senate of the Republic. There is a slight nuance, however: 
Chamber of Deputies President Monde and Jean-Louis, president of 
the official Senate Office, are expecting the members of the 
45th legislature at 1100, while Sansaricq is expecting them at 
1200. 
  One cannot anticipate which side Monde -- who is torn 
between 
two forces and who, according to what he himself has said, will 
cooperate with whichever Senate Office is operative -- will 
support. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Edner Jean -- live] </F>
  [Text] There is a state of uncertainty in the parliament. 
This session of the National Assembly is submerged in confusion 
and uncertainty. This session, which should close the seventh 
session of the 45th Legislature, has not yet begun. On the 
contrary, consultations are being held by the political blocs in 
the Chamber of Deputies, the president of which, Frantz Robert 
Monde, is meeting right now with the president of the regular 
Senate, Firmin Jean-Louis. [Jean] The meeting between the 
president of the regular Senate, Firmin Jean-Louis, and the 
president of the Chamber of Deputies has just ended. It is still 
not known what they discussed or what decisions were made on 
holding of this National Assembly. Frantz Robert Monde has just 
come out of this meeting and invited the deputies to meet with 
him immediately in the Diplomatic Room for an important 
communication. Right now, consultations continue within the 
political blocs. The socialist bloc is consulting with its 
members in camera. The Parliamentary Bloc-National Front for 
Change and Democracy deputies and senators are dispersed. They 
are not being consulted. The senators led by Bernard Sansaricq, 
however, are also consulting with one another. 
  Preparations continue for this National Assembly, and the 
question remains: Will this seventh session be closed because of 
the insignificant number of deputies -- about 30 at the moment. 
Thus, there is no quorum; the roll has not been called. 
Meanwhile, reporters are there, waiting for the show to begin.

  [Text] PANPRA [Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary

parties to meet immediately to analyze the latest situation. 
  [Begin Gilles recording in Creole] I would like to send this 
call to all political leaders, especially the moderate ones; all 
Haitian political leaders; all Haitian political parties that 
belong to the center. This does not mean that I exclude the 
others, but I think the moderates can understand me better. They 
must meet, they must discuss, they must issue a statement in 
which they clearly express their position to the international 
community. I am also calling on the social sectors, all the 
labor unions, to put their heads together to find a consensus, 
to express their position, and to make the international 
community know that if the new sanctions are applied, the 
Haitian people will disappear. 
  Finally, my call goes out to General Cedras and President 
Aristide to do their best, to make all possible and imaginary 
concessions in order to solve the problem within the framework 
of the parliamentary plan. I believe it is possible. [end

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Cabinet Lengthens Supervision of St. </F>
Maarten"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The island of St. Maarten is to remain 
under supervision. At Minister Hirsch Ballin's proposal, the 
cabinet agreed to lengthen the current supervision arrangement 
to 1 September of this year. 
  The decision gives the new Pourier government of the 
Netherlands Antilles, sworn in on 31 March, the time to set up a 
new administrative structure for the island. 
  The reason the government was put under supervision was the 
financial and administrative mismanagement suffered over the 
past few years under the leadership of local leader C. Wathey. 
Wathey is the suspect in a criminal investigation into fraud 
worth millions surrounding the enlargement of the airport and 
harbor on the island.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Gaona and Georgina Tristan] </F>
  [Text] In the final stretch of Carlos Salinas de Gortari's 
term as president, his political and social finishes [cierre] 
are viewed by the government itself as "unstable," while his 
economic finish is "threatening." 
  A "confidential" report by the Attorney General's Office 
[PGR] entitled "Mexico, Picture of Violence," which was 
completed one day before Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination, 
states that Salinas' administration has been the most turbulent 
administration in the past 36 years. 
  The 46-page document states that Adolfo Lopez Mateos' 
administration had an "unstable" social finish, but it was 
politically and economically "stable." Jose Lopez Portillo's 
political and social finishes were "stable," but his economic 
finish was "unstable." Miguel de la Madrid's were economically 
and socially "stable" but politically "unstable." 
  Meanwhile, the report states that in view of the upcoming 
federal elections on 21 August, it is important to protect 
citizens nationwide through the presence of public security 
forces. 
  There is evidence of a serious political schism within 
Salinas' inner circle, a schism which is not only personified by 
Manuel Camacho Solis and his supporters, but which the 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas has used to 
his advantage. 
  The report points out that the Chiapas rebellion and the 
death, violence, and political persecutions it prompted dashed, 
among other myths, the fallacy that Mexico's social peace was 
the envy of many countries in the world. Still, in his final 
State of the Nation address, President Salinas pointed out: "I 
hereby reiterate that Mexico is moving forward confidently and 
calmly with the help of its Armed Forces." 
  The reality experienced by the Mexican people, at least over 
the past 10 years, shows the exact opposite to be true. 
Although its origins were diverse, the myth of social peace 
that the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] had boasted 
about has led to a climate of violence in many parts of the 
country, the PGR report added. 
  The Zapatist revolt revealed a threat that has always 
existed 
as well as proving that social tensions can erupt at any time in 
any part of the nation. They are likely to occur in the wake of 
years of extremely poor economic and social conditions, 
repression, and a lack of mechanisms to participate in politics. 
  Other forms of violence are not simple possibilities, they 
are tangible realities. For example: 

  -  Political violence 
that the state's repressive apparatus -- namely, the Army, state 
and federal police, and judicial institutions, as well as the 
so-called "white guards" of the paramilitary corps -- exercise 
against dissidents who oppose the government, the official 
party, and regional leaders. 
  -  The violence that has been 
unleashed as a result of the war between the various cartels 
fighting over drug production, marketing, and distribution in 
Mexico. 
  -  The violence displayed by numerous gangs of former 
police officers and criminals who have turned kidnapping and 
robberies into their favorite means of obtaining million-dollar 
profits, without ever worrying about whether or not they will 
have to murder their victims. 
  The report acknowledges that political violence seems to 
have 
unleashed its fury in the southeastern part of the nation. This 
region, which has only been thrown the leftovers of the nation's 
economic modernization policy, stands out, because the states 
that comprise it -- Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Puebla, and 
Veracruz -- feature the largest concentrations of poverty and 
abandonment, the worst education and health services, and 
populations predominately comprising peasants and Indians. 
  Together with this area, in states such as Mexico, Hidalgo, 
Morelos, Michoacan, and Tlaxcala, social tensions and political 
confrontations have often turned into political demonstrations 
against the authorities, local leaders, and police. The 
demonstrations have invariably been repressed by the "forces of 
order." 
  The electoral frauds, political challenges, seizing of 
mayoral offices, violent evictions by way of the police, 
arbitrary arrests, and the murder of activists and sympathizers 
of political parties that oppose the PRI have created a vicious 
circle that makes it very difficult for the authorities to 
respond without violence and in accordance with the law. 
  The document notes that one of the main ingredients 
contributing to this climate of violence and social instability 
is the lack of credibility in election results. 
  Tabasco looms as the state first in line on the list of 
electoral risks for "radical changes." Conflicts, in the 
meantime, are possible in the states of Oaxaca, Veracruz, and 
Yucatan as a result of the prevailing social, economic, and 
political situation. "The worst-case scenario, in terms of 
elections, exists in Guerrero and Michoacan, where prospects for 
August are not very encouraging." 
  The document mentions some regions where the PRI 
presidential 
candidate will face difficulty in winning votes in the upcoming 
federal elections: 

  -  Baja California, the first state 
governed by the opposition (PAN) [National Action Party], could 
very well represent a vulnerable region for the PRI candidate, 
although there is a good chance there will be votes to favor the 
candidates of that party for deputy and senatorial posts. 
  -  In 
Chiapas, with a population of more than 3.2 million people, the 
events early this year gave rise to a certain political anarchy 
and opportunism on the part of some political parties, labor 
unions, and government, student, and peasant sectors which 
openly declared support for the demands made by the EZLN 
[Zapatist National Liberation Army]. There were those, in fact, 
who even proposed Subcommander Marcos as a candidate for 
governor of this state. 
  The current situation makes it difficult to define the 
attitude of the people toward the PRI. 

  -  To a great extent, 
Chihuahua represents the largest number of votes for the 
rightists (PAN). The degree of PRI penetration is limited in 
the elections for deputies and senators, just as it is for local 
legislative representatives in some municipalities of less 
importance. 
  -  In Guanajuato, with virtually 4 million inhabitants, 
49 percent of people of voting age, and in one of the three 
PAN-controlled states, there is a minimal degree of conflict. 
It has not been ruled out, however, that there may be 
vulnerable areas or possible postelectoral conflicts. 
  -  Guerrero, 
one of the areas in which the FDN [National Democratic Front] 
won the elections by a majority in 1988, is one of the most 
vulnerable electoral regions for the PRI. This is where Procup 
[Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union Party], the 
Progressive Party of Guerrero, and the Guerrero Civic Party have 
the greatest penetration. 
  Some business groups also play a decisive role: Ruben 
Figueroa Alcocer, Israel Soberanis Nogueda, and Max Tejeda. The 
Catholic Church also maintains a great deal of influence here. 
  This is a state that has a climate that could engender 
conflicts that are not only social, but also political-electoral 
in nature. 

  -  In Jalisco, civilian society is very upset over 
the negligence with which public officials are carrying out 
their work, both at the state and municipal level. Jalisco 
could represent a favorable vote for the PRI candidate, but not 
for the party's senatorial and deputy candidates. 
  -  In the state 
of Mexico, with more than 9.8 million inhabitants, social 
sectors are disgruntled, above all among PRI militants, as is 
evidenced by the occupation of mayoral offices, the blocking of 
highways, and frequent demonstrations. The climate is ripe for 
political and social conflicts. 
  The regions most vulnerable for the PRI are Valle de Chalco, 
Chimalhuacan, Nezhualcoyotl, Los Reyes la Paz, Tejupilco, and 
San Mateo Atenco. 
  To a great extent, the power the PRI still holds is 
attributable to the aid the National Solidarity Program has 
earmarked to traditionally overlooked areas; this, in turn, has 
favored the PRI. 
  Meanwhile, the PAN comprises people from the middle-high 
class. Proof of this is in the zone in which the PRI has not 
been able to win one position [casilla] in several elections. 
It (PAN) is the third political force. 
  As far at the PRD is concerned, its focus of action and 
penetration lies mainly in areas most unprotected and forgotten 
by the authorities. 

  -  The PRD's main bastion is Michoacan, 
where 17.5 percent of the working population comprise artisans 
and laborers and 33.7 percent of the population are farmers. 
  This is the state with one of the greatest risks of 
political 
upheaval by way of post-electoral protests and demonstrations. 
For the election of deputies, senators, and president of the 
Republic, this state is one of weakest in terms of PRI 
support.Morelos, where the rural vote is decisive, does not 
represent an area totally opposed to the PRI. Nevertheless, the 
PRD's influence among the Morelos peasants cannot be 
dismissed.268460096n Nayarit, there is a possible majority vote for the 
PRI in the election for president of the republic, but this does 
not hold true in the election of deputies and senators.Nuevo 
Leon is a state in which there is no immediate climate for 
political conflict. Nevertheless, there is a certain level of 
discontent among lower social classes, teachers, and some labor 
groups. The PRI is strong in this region.2000060100axaca, as other 
states in the nation, has been fated by several administrations 
to economic, social, and political backwardness. Therefore, the 
state's serious economic inequalities, extreme abandonment, and 
poverty are a fertile ground for the rise of political groups 
linked to the defense of human rights. 
  This region is ripe for post-electoral conflicts. 

  -  In San 
Luis Potosi, where there is strong PRD influence, there a 
political and social explosion is waiting to happen. This area 
is very weak in terms of PRI voters, particularly in the 
presidential elections. 
  -  Tabasco, which in the past three years 
has become totally polarized as a result of the diverse 
political, social, and economic problems, is susceptible to 
political and social conflicts. This region is vulnerable for 
the PRI. 
  -  In Yucatan, there are approximately 400,000 unhappy PRI 
members; therefore, there exists a climate ripe for political 
conflicts. This could be a stumbling block for the PRI and help 
the PAN in the federal elections, particularly with regard to 
the federal deputies and senators.

<F P=106> [Report by Gabriela Hernandez] </F>
  [Text] Ciudad Victoria -- Yesterday, Tamaulipas Attorney 
General Raul Morales Cadena assured Juan Garcia Abrego's gang, 
known as the Matamoros Cartel, has shifted its center of 
operations to Monterrey. "In fact the Matamoros Cartel no longer 
exists in Tamaulipas; it has transferred to Nuevo Leon," the 
attorney general said. "In Matamoros, the Garcia Abrego gang 
has been totally dismembered. Even the PGR [Attorney General's 
Office] is looking for them in Monterrey instead of Matamoros 
because it is known that they have transferred to that city." 
  Garcia Abrego, leader of the Matamoros Cartel, is one of the 
drug traffickers most wanted at present by Mexican and U.S. 
authorities. His gang has been accused of over 60 homicides and 
is known as one of the Cali Cartel's leading connections in the 
cocaine trade. 
  The attorney general said that only third-rate drug 
traffickers remain in Matamoros, where violent drug-related 
incidents are growing less frequent. "In Matamoros," he said 
"all that is left are memories of the Oliverio Chavez Araujo 
gang; what we have now are third-rate drug traffickers who are 
struggling for territory." 
  He pointed out that the special operations initiated last 
year by the PGR forced the gangs to flee to other cities where 
it would be more difficult to identify them. "The PGR has 
continued its operations and investigations in Matamoros," he 
said, "but we presume that Garcia Abrego's center of operations 
is now in Monterrey." 
  Morales Cadena believes that the Matamoros Cartel 
transferred 
to Monterrey and is operating in that city because several of 
Garcia Abrego's top lieutenants have been spotted there. Jose 
Carlos Resendez was arrested in Monterrey last week; he is 
considered one of the Matamoros Cartel capo's money launderers. 
  The attorney general also said that last week a residence in 
the Del Salle neighborhood in Monterrey was seized from Raul 
Valladares del Angel, who is believed to be one of Garcia 
Abrego's partners. Valladares del Angel has been a fugitive ever 
since he escaped from jail in Cameron County, Texas, last year. 
  The attorney general explained that the transfer of cartel 
operations is evident in the Matamoros homicide rate, which 
dropped 50 percent during the first quarter as compared to the 
same period in 1993. "Most significantly, 60 percent of the 
homicides perpetrated on the border used to be drug-related, but 
thus far this year we have only discovered drug connections in 
four murders," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Ismael Romero] </F>
  [Text] The National Action Party [PAN] says a transition to 
democracy and a state of law demands transformation of the 
presidential institution. Consequently for the next six-year 
term, PAN is proposing a government platform to limit the 
executive's powers and an ample and in-depth reform of the 
Constitution and bylaws regarding at least 50 key areas of 
national aspects. 
  If Diego Fernandez de Cevallos wins the 21 August 
presidential elections, he will stimulate during his first 100 
days of government great respect for the separation of branches 
and the federal pact, and he will encourage through the proper 
legislative channels a reform of the fundamental Constitution 
articles, such as 27, 123, 115, 4, and others, as well as of 
basic laws, such as the Labor Law, the Law on the Congress of 
the Union, the Law on the Responsibilities of Public Officials, 
the Law on Foreign Trade, Energy, and National Fund for Workers' 
Housing. 
  In addition, and as part of an in-depth administrative 
reform, he will take firm steps to reinforce the executive, 
legislative, and judicial branches, unincorporate the national 
railroads, dissolve the Agrarian Reform Secretariat, and create 
a national ombudsman's office for general rural development, a 
general judicial council, a federal education council, and a 
national housing committee. 
  Regarding human rights, PAN and its candidate suggest 
reorganizing the national commission in charge of protecting 
personal rights. PAN and its candidate have also outlined the 
following government programs and plans: a national plan to 
lower the level of poverty; a national housing plan; a national 
plan for a balanced regional development; a new fishing 
strategy; and a national program for the industrial and 
commercial development of goods and services, among others. 
  The PAN government proposal is included in its 1994 to 2000 
political platform in which the party and its candidate propose 
four great challenges and five commitments "in view of the 
national situation, full of uncertainty and injustice." 
  The challenges are: to stimulate the country's general 
development to improve the lot of 40 million poor Mexicans; to 
develop and reinforce national culture in a world inclined to 
globalization; to abolish the sociopolitical system of abuse, 
oppression, and impunity that has been imposed on Mexican 
society; and to establish a system of freedom and full social, 
civil, and political rights. 
  The commitments are: to create a state of law; to establish 
a 
training-education system in the country; to develop a humane 
and modern economy; to provide the social and environmental 
conditions to give the Mexican people dignity and a high 
standard of living; and to practice an active international 
policy, aimed at the national common good, which stimulates the 
universal common good. 
  For PAN, "it is not hatred, overflowing revengeful passions, 
a single-minded obsession to seize power, or the perversion of 
politics and corruption but, rather, respect for humans and love 
of the homeland and its virtues, and what can inspire programs 
to solve the country's problems." 
<H5>  Genuine State of Law </H5>
  The result of an in-depth and extensive consultation among 
its more than 140,000 active members, PAN's proposal states that 
for the Mexican people the political system of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI] has reached "a dead-end" due to its 
marked corruption and simulation of legality. For this reason, 
this system cannot work in a state of law. 
  Human and political rights are violated; the Presidency 
remains an "irresponsible" institution; the legislative branch 
does not perform its proper functions; the judicial branch is 
not autonomous; there is a "suffocating" centralism; there is no 
democratic electoral system; dehumanization, depersonalization, 
and depoliticization are reinforced through formal and informal 
educational systems; crime and corruption worsen. 
  In sum, due to a lack of a state of law, the Mexican public 
administration is plagued with corruption. As a result, the 
public administration constantly affronts the people. 
  The party believes the creation of a state of law should 
quickly be based on the following fields: political ethics; 
structure and form of the Mexican state's organization; how the 
people can participate; education and the formation of a 
democratic culture; civil security; and the fight against 
corruption. 
  The strategies and guidelines PAN is proposing are aimed at 
protecting man's rights, given he is conceived until he dies. 
For this purpose, PAN will insist on the need to reform Article 
4 of the Constitution and establish that every human being, due 
to his dignity, shall enjoy legal protection from the moment he 
is conceived. PAN's proposal will reject the legalization of 
abortion and suggest dispatching adoption procedures 
expeditiously. 
  If he wins the presidential elections, Fernandez de 
Cevallos' administration will call a nationwide human rights 
conference aimed at revising the Constitution and laws and 
adjusting our national legislation to the international human 
rights framework, thus eliminating all reservations or 
incompatibilities with international human rights treaties and 
pacts signed and confirmed by Mexico. 
  Fernandez de Cevallos' administration will strengthen and 
fine tune the government bodies created for the protection and 
promotion of human rights and will promote legal reforms to 
eliminate the authorities' influence on the labor unions' 
internal affairs, their records, changes in leadership, and 
right to strike. Other reforms will be made to guarantee 
respect for "broad" rights, such as calm, public peace, life in 
a healthy atmosphere and public decorum. 
  The Constitution will be subjected to further reforms to 
limit the powers of the federal executive branch and to 
eliminate its "metaconstitutional powers." For example, the 
"secret allotments" granted the executive will be reduced. 
  The Congressional Organic Law and corresponding Internal 
Regulation will be reformed to dignify the legislative branch 
and expand its powers to include, among other things, the 
investigation of serious and specific cases through special 
commissions. 
  The judicial branch's autonomy will be respected, and a 
general judicial council will be created to execute a system of 
legal guarantees for appointments and impartial promotion for 
members of that branch, and to resolve complaints by individuals 
concerning the administration of justice. 
  PAN will also offer political decentralization and respect 
for federalism. Thus, institutions and municipalities will be 
granted powers that have been inappropriately assigned to the 
executive. 
  Decisionmaking will be federalized, and to this end a 
Federal 
Tax Council and a contingency fund will be created to provide 
timely help and resources for states and towns affected by 
natural disasters or acute economic problems. 
  Municipal life will be respected and reforms to Article 115 
will be promoted, thereby making it possible for municipalities 
to impugn laws and actions by state or federal authorities who 
violate their autonomy, deny, or withhold resources from them, 
and so that town councils can come together under the 
proportional system of representation with a dominant majority. 
The democratic formation of metropolitan councils will be 
promoted in cities and conurbations. 
  The federal government led by PAN will take "firm steps" 
toward definitively establishing the legal foundations for fair 
competition for power. To this end, it will seek to establish 
actions for relief pertaining to electoral matters; to guarantee 
the impartiality of the electoral authorities; to punish 
behaviors that violate freedom and the secrecy of the vote; to 
establish equality in competition; to foster and regulate public 
debates between candidates and prohibit all parties from using 
the fatherland's colors and symbols on their emblems. 
  Meanwhile, in addition to demanding the abolition of the 
party-government system and guaranteeing equitable, honest, and 
democratic elections, PAN will propose constitutional and 
regulatory reforms to establish referendums, plebiscites, and 
popular initiatives at the federal, state, and municipal levels. 
  Freedom of expression will be protected and respected as a 
natural right and not as a state concession. The system of 
discretional concessions for radio and television stations that 
is in place will be replaced by a regulatory system of 
authorization. 
  To guarantee citizens' security, constitutional and legal 
reforms will be pursued to make the Attorney General's Office 
autonomous; security and police corps will be reformed; the 
Ministerial Police Force will be created; a national security 
program will be designed; a national registry for police data 
will be established; and citizen public security councils will 
be formed. 
  A federal code of administrative procedures will be created 
to reform the public administration. The Comptroller General's 
Office will perform internal public administration tasks, and 
the Chamber of Deputies Finance Accountancy [Contaduria Mayor de 
Hacienda de la Camara de Diputados] will conduct audits. The 
law on the responsibility of public workers will be made 
stricter and more effective, and the National Human Rights 
Committee will be authorized to receive complaints about 
government officials who adversely affect the rights of 
taxpayers and public service users. Likewise, the law will be 
amended to recognize the state's civil responsibility toward 
citizens and provide for their indemnification when required. 
<H5>  New Relationship With The United States </H5>
  On the international front, PAN believes that Mexico does 
not 
have an overall political strategy to face the challenges posed 
by the new world order. Mexican foreign policy has been 
fashioned according to the regime's interests, not to encourage 
and defend national interests. This has resulted in the 
adoption of "shameful" positions with tragic results for the 
country. 
  There has been a heavy bias toward the U.S. option, which 
prevents greater and more effective international pluralism. 
World changes have heightened the Mexican political regime's 
internal decadence, thus diminishing the country's negotiating 
capacity and the honorability of its foreign policy. 
  PAN, therefore, includes in its government program a new 
foreign policy that will not be just a trade proposal. The new 
foreign policy will encourage review and renewal of diplomatic 
practices and will respond to national interests. It will be an 
active foreign policy not just a defensive foreign policy. 
  PAN will struggle to become multi-directional and pro-Latin 
American. It will fight for overall reform of all multinational 
organizations, the formation of a world parliamentary assembly, 
a Latin American community of nations, and a Latin American 
parliament. 
  In terms of Mexico's relations with the United States, PAN 
believes they must be renewed based on five points: respect 
between two democratic states, trade association, recognition of 
socioeconomic differences, coordination in the solution of 
conflicts, and vigorous defense of migrant Mexicans. 
  PAN argues that Mexican diplomacy will no longer be an 
opportunity for prizes, political sinecures, or a pretext to 
send adversaries into exile. The Mexican foreign service will 
become professional and specialized. 
  Lastly, with a PAN administration, constitutional reforms 
will be sought to broaden the foreign policy powers of the 
Chamber of Deputies as well as to create a legal framework that 
will allow control over economic and noneconomic aspects of 
NAFTA and which will protect national interest. PAN will oppose 
any NAFTA renegotiation that could reduce opportunities and 
benefits.

<F P=106> [Article by Jesus Sanchez] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chis. [Chiapas], 5 May -- Tense 
and anxious cattle owners, tradesmen, and businessmen have asked 
presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo to strive for a vigorous 
legal recovery that will allow peace negotiations to end the 
"painful path" that let impunity reign over justice. 
  Although the presidential candidate acknowledged that the 
conflict "has placed injustice above justice," he praised the 
resumption of the negotiations between the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN), whom he called for the first time by its 
real name, and Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. 
  Zedillo's proselytizing campaign in Chiapas was used to 
support the gubernatorial candidate of the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party], Eduardo Robledo Rincon. The security 
surrounding the candidates was low-profile. They visited a 
radio station in Tapachula and attended a rally along with 
fellow PRI members. Later, he attended a feast at the 
Montecarlos Room of the Flamboyant Hotel. 
  A communique signed by Manuel Camacho Solis and Bishop 
Samuel 
Ruiz was made public in San Cristobal de las Casas, which is 
less than three hours from Tuxtla. The communique announced 
that the negotiations will resume. 
  The cattle owners were expecting a strong response to their 
demands. Alberto Marin, president of the Northern Zone Cattle 
Owners Union, told reporters that cattle owners will hand 
Ernesto Zedillo a document stating that nothing tangible has 
been done so far to honor the commitments made during the 16 May 
[as published] meeting with the Army chief to solve the problem 
of 150,000 hectares in the municipalities of Altamirano, 
Ocosingo, and Margaritas. 
  The cattle owner leader said: "Nothing has been done." He 
added that economic losses in the region affected by the armed 
conflict amount to 300 billion old pesos [currency as 
published]. He added that it is still a delicate situation and 
that 30 percent of the state's livestock owners are virtually 
idle, a situation that sooner or later will prompt the import of 
not only meat and milk but also corn. These comments flew from 
one table to another as the meal in honor of Ernesto Zedillo was 
being served. The cattle owners could barely taste the chicken 
breast with vegetables that was being served. 
  The claims of those who are on the other side of the Chiapas 
conflict were harsh. Gonzalo Lopez Camacho, president of the 
Center Zone Cattle Owners Union, noted Zedillo's views on lack 
of security and said that Chiapas cattle owners have travelled a 
painful road full of offal, assaults, kidnappings, and 
robberies. This situation requires agreements that, in addition 
to reaching peace, "will fairly recognize the efforts made by 
the state's productive sectors" to ensure the forces hampering 
production will wane. 
  The cattle owners representative supported Eduardo Robledo's 
candidacy. He said Robledo will reestablish the rights of the 
Chiapas residents without controversies or violence. He 
insisted, however, that the despoiling attempts against the 
patrimony of many Chiapas residents are in the hands of 
"intellectually deprived individuals who are currently hiding 
behind impunity." 
  Francisco Gutierrez, leader of the National Association of 
the Processing Industry, made a rough estimate of 
underdevelopment in Chiapas, to which he added the expectations 
of movements that sow division and violence. He strongly 
criticized the federal government for its mismanagement of the 
state developmental process and insisted industrialists need 
security for their families and assets. 
  Tradesmen leader Walter Leon said they are tired of hearing 
promises and are no longer willing to live with the dream that 
Chiapas residents are potentially rich although they live poorly. 
  The Chiapas production sectors waited until Zedillo spoke. 
They showed no sign of being overwhelmingly jubilant. He said: 
"I know that the conflict has unfortunately piled injustice upon 
injustice. I hope tolerance, dialogue, and reconciliation will 
prevail to ensure that the final results of the negotiations 
will fairly meet legitimate demands. The agreements must also 
be fair to ensure that those who obey the laws, but whose 
personal lineage and patrimonial integrity have been affected, 
will be respected." 
  Zedillo then talked about the upcoming resumption of the 
peace negotiations and pointed out that the institutions have 
shown determination to reach an agreement to enjoy a lasting 
peace once again. He added: "As a candidate today and as 
president tomorrow, I am determined to honor all the commitments 
that our patriotic President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will make 
in the name of peace." 
  Very early in Tapachula and through the XEKQ radio station, 
Ernesto Zedillo sent a message to the EZLN and said: "We want 
peace to be signed and will honor the commitments made during 
the process to ensure that Chiapas residents and all Mexicans 
will learn that peace is the road to follow." 
  Some observers who are closely following the Zedillo 
campaign 
said he sounded different from the PRI candidate because he was 
heard through the local sound system sometimes saying "Shapas" 
and "Shapas residents." Perhaps, there was something wrong with 
the sound system. The PRI ceremony had a second meaning in 
Tapachula: to see Zedillo supporting Eduardo Robledo. 
  Amid rattling noises and cheerful slogans such as "You are 
on 
the right track, Zedillo; you are on the right track," Chiapas 
PRI President Gerardo Pensamiento delivered a speech different 
from those he usually makes. At the beginning of the speech, he 
said: "You are among Chiapas friends, who are asking you not to 
make more commitments; we are merely asking you for what we have 
already been promised but which have never been honored." 
  At the Tapachulas Country Club, the delivery of caps and 
t-shirts commanded the attention of the attendees for a long 
time. Security agents drove reporters away. When ordered to, 
two agents virtually flew to the dais to switch the microphones 
that Zedillo would use. 
  Igor [not further identified] led a horde of reporters who 
wanted to make sure they would have access to the pro-Zedillo 
ceremony, but a Staff agent stopped him and they verbally abused 
each other. Those Tapachula residents who witnessed the 
incident said: "If this is what they do to the media, what will 
they do to us?" 
  Zedillo and Robledo embraced, and their followers filled the 
square. Robledo stressed that Chiapas demands a political 
proposal that will not blame anyone or seek revenge. He said: 
"I came here to defend those colors that have already been 
whitened; the colors of personal resentment are among them."

  [Text] Mexico City, May 6 (AFP) -- The Mexican Government 
has resigned its membership in the Group of 77 (G-77), which 
unites all developing countries, as a result of having recently 
joined the OECD, a Foreign Secretariat spokesman said. Mexican 
Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello sent a letter to G-77 President 
Mohamed Salah Dembri informing him that Mexico will no longer 
participate in those mechanisms in which developing countries 
define their position vis-a-vis the industrialized nations, the 
source added. 
  In his letter, Tello emphasized that Mexico's entry into the 
OECD, known as the rich countries' club, "does not mean we will 
dissociate ourselves from the problems of the developing world" 
and will continue to work to increase "the advantageous, frank, 
and meaningful relations of cooperation among this group of 
nations." 
  The same source said the letter was sent "three weeks ago" 
but was only revealed today, after EXCELSIOR published its 
contents. Mexico was admitted into the OECD in April and became 
the first Latin American country to join that organization.

<F P=106> [By Cristina Hasbun de Merino] </F>
  [Text] San Jose, 7 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Salvadoran President 
Alfredo Cristiani said today that Central America is en route to 
political stability and that he believes that with the change in 
governments in the area the integration process will receive new 
impetus. 
  In a statement to ACAN-EFE, Cristiani said that Honduras, 
Costa Rica, and El Salvador "have consolidated their 
democracies" with their recent electoral processes and that the 
countries that still "give reason for concern" are Guatemala and 
Nicaragua. 
  Notwithstanding, the Salvadoran president emphasized that 
last year Guatemala was able to solve, "within the framework of 
constitutional legality," the self-inflicted coup of Former 
President Jorge Serrano Elias, after which Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
became president. 
  Cristiani, who signed peace agreements with the former 
Salvadoran guerrilla forces in January 1992, is confident that 
the peace negotiations to end the armed conflict in Guatemala, 
which dates back to 1960, will end successfully and emphasized 
that "the science of peace is patience." He emphasized, 
however, that it is difficult to predict when the government and 
the Guatemalan guerrilla forces will sign a peace agreement, 
because "negotiations are sometimes slow and difficult and one 
cannot be hasty in something so delicate." 
  With respect to Nicaragua's political situation, Cristiani 
said "there are still some details" to clear up, but "little by 
little the Nicaraguan people are overcoming their problems." "I 
believe Central America is headed toward stability; there are no 
destabilizing elements," stated Cristiani, who on 1 June will 
turn the presidency over to President-elect Armando Calderon 
Sol, leader of Cristiani's own right-wing Nationalist Republican 
Alliance party. 
  Cristiani is confident that changes in Central American 
governments will give new impetus to the region's integration 
process, which in recent months have become bogged down due to 
the general elections being carried out in most of these 
countries. 
  He said that, since the beginning of the integration 
process, 
governments of different ideologies have participated and made 
satisfactory headway, and that, because of this, he does not 
believe there will be any delay in this issue as a result of the 
administrative changes going on in El Salvador, Honduras, Costa 
Rica, and, just around the corner, in Panama. 
  Cristiani said he spoke of this with Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina, and with Costa Rican President-elect Jose 
Maria Figueres, who will be sworn in on Sunday, adding: "The two 
are willing to continue the integration effort." In El 
Salvador's case, the president said his party's policy "is in 
favor of integration." 
  Cristiani admitted that the major advances in the Central 
American integration process have centered on economic issues, 
but he did not rule out that in the coming years the social 
aspect might climb higher on the agenda. In addition, the 
president believes it improbable that his country's peace 
process could suffer a setback as a result of the internal 
crisis of the former rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front (FMLN), because the five groups that comprise the FMLN 
signed the accords that put an end to the 12-year war. 
  Cristiani believes the differences that arose within the 
ranks of the FMLN one week ago are "logical" given "their 
different leftist ideologies," which may have united them for 
the armed struggle but could lead to their break up in the 
political arena. 
  "The only problem I consider delicate is the internal 
threats 
that could deteriorate into violence within the FMLN, but the 
government will be ready not only to try to prevent this, but, 
in case violence does occur, to apprehend those responsible and 
put them where they belong," Cristiani said. 
  A clandestine group of dubious ideology threatened the life 
of various former FMLN commanders, including Joaquin Villalobos, 
for having "betrayed revolutionary principles" by negotiating 
with the government on the make-up of the Legislative Assembly 
Directorate.

  [Text] San Jose, Costa Rica, May 7 (CNA) -- President Li 
Teng-hui of the Republic of China [ROC] said here over the 
weekend that the ROC would actively participate in international 
affairs as a sovereign nation. 
  Li, who is now on a official visit to Costa Rica where he 
participated in the inauguration of President Jose Maria 
Figueres Sunday [8 May], made the remarks during a news 
conference held following a breakfast meeting with Figueres. 
  The ROC is a sovereign nation and the world should recognize 
that China is divided and ruled by separate governments, Li said. 
  Under the existing situation, the ROC has two courses of 
action, Li said, including the promotion of substantial 
relations with other nations and improving cross-Taiwan Strait 
relations. 
  "Developing mutual understanding between the two sides of 
the 
Taiwan Strait is important," he emphasized. But it is necessary 
for the ROC to enter the international community as a sovereign 
nation, he added.

  [Text] In his 10th report to the UN secretary general, 
Diego Garcia-Sagan, director of the Human Rights Division of 
Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] noted "a slight 
improvement" in the human rights situation, compared to the 
critical problems noted in recent months. Nevertheless, 
Garcia-Sayan revealed that arbitrary executions and threats of 
arbitrary execution still represent the largest number of 
reports received by Onusal. 
  Between November 1993 and February 1994, the Human Rights 
Division received 35 reports of arbitrary executions and 12 
threats of arbitrary execution. Onusal does not rule out 
political motives in some of these cases. 
  Regarding the death of Francisco Garcia Veliz, leader of the 
FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], the report 
says that investigations have not progressed enough and that 
they apparently have reached "a stalemate" as a result of 
limited sources of information. Velis' autopsy revealed that he 
was a drug addict, so no one knows who would benefit from the 
crime. 
  Garcia-Sayan said Onusal's Human Rights Division is 
continuing its investigation and does not rule out any 
hypothesis, "even though a political motive seems most probable." 
  Likewise, he says that "the police's inability to capture 
the 
culprits and the Judicial Branch's inability to prosecute them 
still represent the basic reason for the high percentage of 
rights violations, particularly with the status of impunity, 
which is still very critical." 
  Garcia-Sayan said the various organized groups of criminals 
who operate in the country comprise former Armed Forces members 
and former FMLN fighters. Referring to the violent actions 
carried out by these groups, he said that they possibly involve 
crimes resulting from "a settling of accounts" with "private" 
political components and that this could be a result of the war. 
  The number of death threat reports received by Onusal rose 
to 
77, which is the highest registered level in 1993 and 1994. 
Some of the cases were a result of the electoral process. The 
report adds that the Judicial Branch and the National Police are 
still the institutions most frequently mentioned by Onusal as 
responsible for human rights violations in the country. Other 
reports received during that period involve mistreatment and the 
state's legal duty to investigate and prosecute.

  [Text] The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) 
has been trying to fill National Civilian Police (PNC) positions 
with undeclared members of the former guerrillas, according to 
the retiring deputy police commissioner. "The FMLN would 
thereby maintain its rear guard in the organization," said Major 
Oscar Armando Pena Duran, who explained that his appointment to 
the PNC was negotiated with the FMLN. "My incorporation was 
negotiated with the FMLN in exchange for some tests for 
mid-level commanders at the Public Security Academy... so that 
their mid-level commanders could join the PNC. It was decided 
during the peace agreements," Pena Duran said. 
  The officer, who is retiring from the Army, explained that 
the FMLN plans failed with regard to incorporation in the Drug 
Trafficking Executive Unit (Unidad Ejecutiva Antinarcotrafico) 
and the Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions of the PNC. 
Pena Duran denied that his resignation was a result of pressure 
and said that he decided to resign because he is suffering from 
an ulcer, for which the doctor recommended a period of absolute 
rest. 
  The first to celebrate Pena's resignation, however, was FMLN 
Coordinator Jorge Shafik Handal. PNC Director Jose Maria 
Monterrey announced that Jaime Vigil will be appointed acting 
deputy police commissioner. Pena Duran worked as deputy 
director of operations in charge of the following divisions: 
public security, criminal investigations, narcotics, weapons, 
explosives, environment, finance, traffic, and borders. 
<H5>  Monterrey's Resignation </H5>
  Meanwhile, PNC Director Monterrey said he would tender his 
resignation when the new government is sworn in so that 
President-elect Armando Calderon Sol can decide who will be in 
charge of the police organization. It was also reported that 
Mr. Monterrey has expressed his intention to return to private 
business and that the new government's advisory team is looking 
for someone to replace him.

  [Text] Mexico City, 9 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) today in Mexico City 
dismissed the possibility of an immediate cease-fire 
declaration, thereby rejecting the position of the organized 
business leaders and Guatemalan Army. To attach utmost 
importance to their position is to reduce the negotiation "to a 
simple laying down of weapons by the URNG, without having 
resolved any of the causes that generated and perpetuates the 
armed conflict," the guerrillas said. 
  The Coordinating Committee of Farming, Commercial, 
Industrial, and Financial Associations and Guatemalan Defense 
Minister Mario Enriquez said last week that there must be a 
cease-fire before the peace dialogue resumes. 
  In a communique broadcast in Mexico City, the URNG General 
Command insisted that "a cease-fire declaration at this time 
will not resolve this problem," referring to the situation in 
the Central American country. The Guatemalan guerrillas also 
reiterated that the creation of a Truth Commission "is not only 
essential but unpostponable in view that it is a substantial 
component of eradicating impunity." 
  The government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and the 
URNG are scheduled to meet in Oslo, Norway, at the end of May. 
In March, they agreed that in the meeting they will discuss the 
establishment and operation of this commission. 
  The release of the rebel document coincided with remarks by 
De Leon Carpio, who in San Jose, Costa Rica, viewed as 
inadvisable the creation of the commission because it might 
deepen wounds and hinder the peace negotiations. For the URNG, 
the president has "only one choice" and that "is to fulfill and 
enforce the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and give 
concrete signs of wanting to achieve progress in the 
negotiation." 
  The government and the URNG have been engaged in a process 
of 
talks aimed at ending an armed conflict that, according to 
humanitarian organizations, has left about 175,000 dead in 34 
years.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 7 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today appointed lawyers Acisclo 
Valladares as the new attorney general and Ranses Cuestas as the 
new prosecutor general. Valladares is reassuming the post he 
held during the government of overthrown President Jorge Serrano 
(1991-1993). 
  Before swearing in the new officials, President de Leon 
Carpio explained that the new attorney general will serve as an 
adviser and consultant to state institutions. 
  Valladares left office in 1993 after being suspended. At 
that time the courts charged that Valladares had refrained from 
bringing fraud charges against his brother Luis Domingo 
Valladares. 
  Presidency sources told ACAN-EFE that Cuestas, a lawyer with 
30 years experience, has never held a public office. 
  Valladares and Cuestas will assume the offices Telesforo 
Guerra Cahn held simultaneously. The attorney general was 
chosen directly by the president while the prosecutor general 
was chosen from among six candidates presented by a nominating 
committee headed by the Supreme Court of Justice.

  [Text] Yesterday, in an appearance before the Congress of 
the Republic, Foreign Relations Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman 
confirmed that Guatemala still maintains its territorial claims 
over Belize and plans to allow the people to voice their opinion 
on the issue by means of a referendum. 
  During a meeting with the Foreign Relations Committee, the 
minister explained that no unexpected readjustments to the 
guidelines of the dispute with the Belizean people are expected 
to take place during her term as minister and that they are 
prepared to resort to any legal means in order to resolve the 
dispute. 
  As established by the Constitution, after the Belize Council 
has been established, one of the points to be put on its agenda 
will be to request the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to call the 
Guatemalan people to a referendum so they may voice their 
opinion on the issue. 
  Even though the minister indicated that the Belize Council 
will be directly responsible for negotiating the territorial 
dispute, she also explained that at any given moment it could 
request mediation by the international community, which has 
expressed interest in the problem. 
  In addition, the United Nations will be made aware of the 
objectives sought by the proviso submitted a few months ago. 
  With respect to the extradition of [former President] Jorge 
Serrano Elias, the minister indicated that the court responsible 
for the case has not yet forwarded any [extradition] request to 
the Foreign Ministry. 
<H5>  Belize Council To Be Established in 10 Days </H5>
  The foreign minister stated that the Belize Council will be 
established in no less than 10 days. She also abstained from 
identifying the candidates selected to become members of the 
aforementioned council and indicated that there are still talks 
to be held with some of them in order to confirm their 
disposition to participate. 
  According to the foreign minister, a preliminary list of 
candidates has already been discussed with President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio, and, if there are no objections, she would proceed 
to forward invitations to the citizens named as possible council 
members.

  [Text] Henry W. Anderson, Belizean ambassador to Guatemala, 
yesterday said his government is prepared to begin negotiations 
on the territorial dispute with Guatemala; adding that a 
commission has been created for this purpose and only the final 
details must be settled. 
  The Guatemalan Government has recognized Belize's 
independence; therefore, we have accepted the fact that a border 
dispute prevails between the two countries, a situation we hope 
will be handled cordially, he said. Regarding the 
organization of a Belizean Council, the ambassador said this is 
considered positive because it is a sign the Guatemalan 
Government is prepared to begin negotiations to settle the 
dispute. 
  Belize is interested in establishing trade, cultural, 
and sports relations, not only with Guatemala but with all of 
Central America; and that is one of the reasons that prompt us 
to be prepared to negotiate what is negotiable, Anderson 
said. The ambassador also said he cannot release the names of 
the persons who make up the Belizean commission that will 
participate in the negotiations, because he does not have them. 
  He also referred to the role played by the media in the 
case, 
which is important, to establish the objective atmosphere 
necessary to settle relations between the States of Guatemala 
and Belize. The diplomat added that Belize's recognition as an 
independent state by the media, and the illustration of this on 
the region's maps, will represent a great step forward.

  [Text] Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger reported 
that during the first working meeting between the Taiwanese 
president's delegation and the Chamorro cabinet officials from 
both nations acknowledged the economic progress made in four 
years of government with the support of the Republic of China 
and the pardoning of 75 percent of Nicaragua's debt. 
  This working meeting was attended by the minister-president 
of the Council of Economic Planning and Development, the 
president of the Federation of Industries and Chambers of 
Commerce, and the minister-president of the Central Bank of 
Taiwan. 
  Social Action Minister William Baez, the Central Bank 
president, the foreign relations minister, and the economy 
minister represented Nicaragua. 
  Among the topics discussed were the structural adjustment, 
economic stabilization, foreign cooperation, continued support, 
and the market economy. 
  Kruger affirmed that a document pardoning 75 percent of 
Nicaragua's debt with Taiwan and outlining cooperation for the 
1994-96 period will be signed today. The cooperation accord 
will be defined in this second round of meetings. 
  Social Action Minister William Baez said the meeting was 
fruitful because the economic cabinet was able to explain the 
problems with the debt payment. He added that the Taiwanese 
officials expressed their firm interest in continuing to support 
Nicaragua. 
  Baez asserted that the issue that most impressed the 
Taiwanese delegation was the 20-percent growth in the 
agricultural sector, a figure they considered very high.

<F P=106> [From the "Extravision" newscast; passages within quotation </F>
marks are recorded] 
  [Text] The Government Ministry will ask the National 
Legislative Assembly to expedite approval of the draft narcotics 
law. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta today announced that 
the U.S. Government will contribute $100,000 to the fight 
against drug trafficking. He also announced that the Nicaraguan 
Government will present a formal request to the United States to 
open a DEA office in the country. [Sandinist] Deputy Doris 
Tijerino, chairperson of the Legislative Assembly drug 
committee, recently warned of the danger that such a move would 
represent, saying that opening a DEA office in Nicaragua would 
be an affront to national sovereignty. 
  Minister Alfredo Mendieta rejected drug trafficking charges 
against members of the National Police [PN], calling the 
incidents a campaign to discredit the institution. Today he 
denied that any high-ranking PN officer was involved in drug 
trafficking and affirmed that there are political motives behind 
the accusations. 
  [Mendieta] "I strongly deny that the PN, as an institution, 
could be involved in any way. I strongly reject any implication 
of involvement by PN Brigade Commander Fernando Caldera. I 
think it is all politically motivated. Although this may 
surprise the media, I think there are some politicians behind 
all this, as I have said from the beginning." 
  Commander Roger Ramirez said that he has done nothing 
illegal, much less behind the backs of the PN commanders. He 
was referring to his 25-percent partnership in a hotel on Corn 
Island, which represents a $55,000 investment. He said he 
received the money as compensation from the Government Ministry. 
Mendieta confirmed Ramirez' statements. 
  [Mendieta] "We have no evidence indicating that Commander 
Ramirez was ever involved in drug trafficking or any other 
drug-related crime. We are aware of Mr. Ramirez' investments, 
and he has told us that these funds came from payments made by 
the Government Ministry during his transition and in 
compensation for injuries sustained in the line of duty." 
  The government minister today strongly criticized those who 
want to discredit the PN. 
  [Mendieta] "You cannot implicate an institution such as the 
PN, which has demonstrated a high degree of efficiency in the 
fight against drug trafficking. Furthermore, we believe it is 
even more dangerous to implicate certain individuals who are in 
fact involved in drug trafficking." [sentence as heard] 
  Commander Roger Ramirez stated that he has the full support 
of Brigade Commander Augusto Fernando Caldera as well as of his 
commanding officer, Lionel Espinosa, both of whom are well aware 
of the fact that he requested his discharge for family and 
health reasons. Ramirez said he has no enemies in the PN ranks. 
  [Ramirez] "If there is any kind of ill will over this whole 
matter, as some newspaper reports indicate, I do not think it is 
coming from the PN. Then again, I cannot say that for a fact, 
because one minute you think you have friends, and the next they 
stab you in the back." 
  Ramirez said his conscience is clean. 
  [Ramirez] "I think there are some people interested in 
discrediting me simply because I tried to maintain a 
professional image within the institution in accordance with the 
ground rules the government set forth for the institutions that 
make up the Armed Forces. In the end, I have a clean and 
peaceful conscience." 
  Commander Roger Ramirez presented documentation for his 
partnership in the Corn Island hotel and for his bank accounts 
and bank deposits, which total less than $12,000. 
  [Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish on 2 May publishes a 
475-word report on pages 1 and 8 stating that "EL NUEVO DIARIO 
has learned that PN Brigade Commander Caldera forced Commander 
Roger Ramirez to resign." The report goes on to say that "our 
sources assured us that Ramirez was found to have a checking 
account with a $240,000 balance, which he could not explain," 
adding that the "DEA advised Caldera that the funds were from 
drug trafficking activities." The report warns that "the 
entangling nets of drug trafficking are gaining ground in 
Nicaragua," pointing out that "one high-ranking officer has 
become addicted to cocaine" and the identity of another, "known 
as the `narco-policeman,' will soon be released."]

<F P=106> [Report by Noel Irias] </F>
  [Text] In a summons that exceeded all expectations, an 
assembly of more than 600 Sandinist professionals and 
technicians was held yesterday to discuss the FSLN [Sandinist 
National Liberation Front] congress, the crisis within this 
organization, and its possible solutions. 
  Most of these professionals did not participate in the rank 
and file discussions of reforms to the party statutes. 
  Generally speaking, the participants who spoke called 
themselves members of "no particular current" or "dispersed 
Sandinists." 
  Speaking on behalf of the Majority current, Carlos Fernando 
Chamorro said it was necessary to create spaces to allow a 
regrouping and political expression of dispersed Sandinists. 
  Chamorro said professionals and technicians should "be 
viewed 
in the Sandinist ranks as individuals that have the right to 
speak and to decide, not as instruments of a group of 
enlightened." 
  Upon explaining the position of the current of which he is a 
member, Chamorro insisted "the renovation of the FSLN must 
continue; it must go beyond Congress." 
  Among those present, attorney Gonzalo Carrion and 
sociologist 
Luis Mora expressed their opposition to the currents. In 
particular, Luis Mora harshly criticized the Majority's position. 
  Prominent businessman Jose Dolores Gomez said he is strongly 
"opposed to a continuation of the same leadership in the FSLN." 
  Angela Rosa Acevedo and Mayra Pasos insisted women should 
have more opportunities for power within the party. 
  Silvio Prado proposed to declare a permanent session and 
establish communication networks as part of the current 
political debate in the FSLN. 
<H5>  Delegates From the Leftist Current Did Not Attend </H5>
  The results of a poll among the 216 participants has 
revealed 
that most of the participants believe it is necessary to change 
the name of the National Directorate, to legalize currents of 
opinion, and to establish a single category of FSLN members. 
  Most participants also expressed their support for the civic 
methods of protest, territorial election of Sandinist candidates 
to public office, and power quotas for youths and women. 
  According to Dr. Alejandro Martinez Cuenca, who organized 
this event, the original idea was to hear statements from two 
representatives of each current and then hear the proposals of 
participants, but the delegates from the Democratic Left did not 
show up. 
  Martinez explained Julio Lopez Campos and William Grigsby, 
spokespersons for the Democratic Left current, and Conapro 
[National Confederation of Professional Associations] President 
Felix Contreras were convoked to participate in the debate. 
  Both Martinez Cuenca and moderator Mario Flores expressed 
regretted over the nonparticipation of the delegates of that 
current. 
<H5>  Henry Ruiz: The Most Popular Candidate </H5>
  The organizers of the event circulated a survey on the main 
reforms to the FSLN's statutes and on the candidates to the 
highest positions of leadership within the organization. 
  The participants filled out 477 answer sheets, and by the 
time we went to press 216 sheets, namely, 45 percent, had been 
processed. These partial results were presented by Martinez 
Cuenca. 
  According to 47 percent of those whose replies were 
processed, the possible candidates to the FSLN leadership would 
be, according to the number of votes, Henry Ruiz, Sergio 
Ramirez, Dora Maria Tellez, Daniel Ortega, Doris Tijerino, Luis 
Carrion, Mariano Fiallos, Monica Baltodano, Tomas Borge, Daniel 
Nunez, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, and Fernando Cardenal. 
  In addition, Alejandro Martinez, Victor Tinoco, Carlos 
Tunnermann, Mirna Cunningham, Alejandro Serrano, Leticia 
Herrera, and Vilma Nunez appeared on the survey. 
  Approximately 40.3 percent of those polled said the highest 
FSLN post should be occupied by Henry Ruiz, 18.1 chose Sergio 
Ramirez, and 17.1 percent preferred Daniel Ortega. 
  Regarding the second highest party position, those polled 
preferred Henry Ruiz, with 14.4 percent, Dora Maria Tellez, with 
13 percent, and Daniel Ortega, with 12.5 percent. 
  The assembly was presided over by Alejandro Martinez Cuenca, 
Ernesto Medina, rector of the Unan [National Autonomous 
University of Nicaragua]-Leon Branch, Dr. Edgar Morin, attorney 
Linda Baez, architect Mario Flores, Ramiro Bermudez, and Dr. 
Benedicto Meneses. 
  Medina closed the assembly by reflecting upon the issue of 
tolerance within Sandinism. 
<H5>  JS [Sandinist Youth Association] To Hold An Assembly </H5>
  In addition, Larry Astorga, JS spokesman, reported yesterday 
that group will hold a forum on 13 May to discuss and approve a 
proposal of policies for the sector the FSLN must include. 
  They will also discuss a proposal of political positions of 
the JS on the FSLN, Astorga added. 
  Meanwhile, the Sandinists grouped in the university 
organizations will hold a similar working session on 17 May.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tomas Borge, member of the FSLN National </F>
Directorate, by Noel Irias on 29 April; place not given] 
  [Text] [Irias] What are the political tasks facing the 
Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN]? 
  [Borge] We could say that we are placing all our hopes on 
the 
FSLN coming out of the congress united, unified, and ready to 
prepare a strategic plan for the new situation that will emerge 
with the Congress. 
  The Sandinist Congress represents the culmination of one 
phase and the beginning of another during which we must persuade 
the Nicaraguan people that we are the best choice for governing 
the country and finding solutions to the many problems and 
demands that have proliferated in recent times. 
  [Irias] Is there a threat of division in the FSLN? 
  [Borge] In all the departments, the rank and file is 
demanding unity. Any attempt to break this unity will clash 
with the iron will of the Sandinists. 
  The struggle must be directed against divisionist maneuvers, 
if they ever appear, and against attempts to deform the FSLN and 
create a different party. The struggle must be directed at 
preventing an FSLN sector from installing a different tent and 
waging a struggle against the Sandinist Front. 
  The majority of the Sandinists favor unity. This explains 
why an overwhelming majority does not favor endorsing tendencies. 
  Tendencies can produce division. However, I favor free 
debate within the FSLN. Nevertheless, I think that debate must 
take place within the party's confines. 
  We must try to avoid division. Some months ago several 
companeros who belong to a specific tendency asked me to run for 
secretary general of the FSLN. 
  I told them: "I do not belong to your tendency. Why are you 
inviting me to be your candidate when you have your own cadres?" 
They insisted on their offer for some time. 
  I saw that as a cheap political maneuver aimed at dividing 
the historic cadres of the FSLN, specifically speaking: to 
produce a confrontation between me and the secretary general of 
the Sandinist Front. 
  I did not fall for that. It was wrong, incorrect, and 
opportunistic. Had I run for secretary general, I would not 
have been the candidate for unity, as I could have been 
ticketed, but the candidate for division. 
  [Irias] Are you saying that if Henry Ruiz were to run as 
candidate for secretary general of the FSLN he would be creating 
conditions that would lead to division in the FSLN? 
  [Borge] What I say about myself perhaps could be said about 
another person, but as everybody knows, I prefer not to mention 
names. I am mentioning mine so that my case can serve as an 
example of what may happen to other companeros. 
  [Irias] What kind of leadership does the FSLN need? 
  [Borge] I have always favored collective leadership. Some 
reason that the collective leadership was weakened by the 
current historic situation. In wartime, power and leadership 
must be centralized. 
  In my opinion, the collective leadership should cover a 
broad 
spectrum. 
  The limitations placed on the National Directorate as leader 
of the party resulted from a collective decision. The 
Directorate decided to centralize authority in the government, 
in particular, and those who are now criticizing this decision 
are the ones who endorsed it then. 
  The Directorate handed its authority over to the government, 
to the executive, and no one protested at that time. 
  In existing circumstances we need as secretary general of 
the 
FSLN -- without detriment to the collective leadership -- a 
companero with historical authority, one who has already 
demonstrated unselfishness, the ability to go evereywhere, and 
the firm decision to lead. 
  The FSLN rank and file has already chosen this cadre. 
  On the other hand, everybody has the right to aspire to a 
position in the Directorate for the sake of collective 
leadership and shared authority, without detriment to the 
establishment of hierarchies. I favor the FSLN having a 
president and a secretary general. 
  The presidency, a position to which I aspire, should be 
considered a representative of the FSLN, a companero and close 
adviser to the secretary general, and his substitute. 
  Why do I seek this position? It is not because of any 
craving for personal ambition or fame, which I do not need, but 
because I believe that in this way I would be better able to 
contribute to a revolutionary leadership, in addition to 
historical reasons. 
  [Irias] Aren't you afraid that your statements on eventual 
candidates for the post of secretary general could increase the 
contradictions surrounding this debate? 
  [Borge] I hope there is no internal division over this 
problem. This is why I reported that an effort was made to lure 
me in the same way that others have been courted in the search 
for a secretary general. 
  I am mentioning this example to invite militants and leaders 
not to do anything that would contravene the FSLN's internal 
unity. 
  [Irias] Would you support Commander Daniel Ortega as 
candidate for the post of secretary general? 
  [Borge] I have said that I prefer not to mention names, but 
I 
will in this case say that I believe that in the framework of a 
collective leadership, Daniel Ortega is the most suitable person 
for the post of secretary general. 
  I have been very critical of Daniel Ortega, much more than 
others in the National Directorate and in private. 
  This critical posture has yielded fruits in recent times. I 
have found Daniel receptive to criticism. I never sweet-talk 
him, as some people who now criticize him and challenge him did 
in the past. 
  I will never stop being a critic, an adviser, and a 
nonservile supporter. I will always tell Daniel Ortega the 
truth as I see it. 
  Of the current cadres, he is the companero most inclined to 
criticize. In addition, with the undue will to accommodate him 
that we demonstrated in the past, we gave him the intransigent 
and authoritarian image he now has. 
  I think this is over. Vertical leadership is not possible 
now. I think that because of his experience, backing, and open 
ears, the person most suited to be FSLN secretary general is 
Daniel Ortega.

  [Text] Daniel Ortega Saavedra, secretary general of the 
FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], said yesterday he 
does not plan to occupy the presidency in 1996. He also said he 
will support a candidate who does not belong to his party, but 
who supports the Sandinist program. 
  In his statements to La Primerisima radio station, Ortega 
hinted that he will not accept Sergio Ramirez as the FSLN's 
official candidate and confirmed he will support a candidate 
with no FSLN ties. Ortega and Ramirez are the leaders of two 
divergent currents that are vying for the leadership of the 
FSLN. The statements by the current FSLN secretary general 
tacitly rule out possible support for Ramirez if he decides to 
become his party's presidential candidate as he has publicly 
said. 
  In his visit to the radio station, which shares his 
political 
views, Ortega pointed out he would like to be reelected 
secretary general, adding that it is unhealthy to have several 
candidates vying for this post. The FSLN leader said: "Several 
candidacies are unhealthy for a revolutionary party; it would be 
as though discord were being sown." Such a comment differs from 
the results of a poll of Sandinist followers conducted by the 
Nicaraguan Study Institute (IEN), which shows that a large 
number of FSLN members believes there should be two or more 
candidates for the post of secretary general. 
  Henry Ruiz, who has more votes than Ortega to occupy this 
high leadership post, on 2 May agreed to vie for leadership of 
the FSLN, which is experiencing one of its worst crises just 
before its 20 May Special Congress. 
  The IEN poll also reveals that the FSLN electorate 
represents 
only 23 percent of the population: 12 percent in the rural area 
and 8 percent from those who never attended school. [figures as 
published] In addition, the poll shows that a large number of 
Sandinists believes a dictatorship exists within the party.

<F P=106> [Report by Edgardo Barbena S.] </F>
  [Text] Five percent of FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation 
Front] militants nationwide have participated in prior "ad hoc" 
congressses or assemblies to discuss the documents of May's 
congress, thus reflecting the disenchantment of the 
card-carrying members, according to FSLN Deputy Sergio Ramirez. 
  Speaking on the Radio Sandino talk show "Face to Face" 
["Frente a Frente"], Ramirez discussed the hot topics of the 
Sandinist debate and cited specific examples of what happened 
during the last FSLN Congress. 
  Approximately 3,000 FSLN members participated in the 
discussion of the documents at the 1991 Congress in Masaya, but 
at the most recent congress the number of participants did not 
even reach 400, a situation that was similar nationwide, 
"meaning the militants do not feel attracted to the party 
positions." 
  "As long as those positions are not made accessible, all the 
people, mostly the young, and not just its militants will move 
away from Sandinism," the FSLN bloc chief told the radio 
station. He also cited the scarce participation of young people 
in party meetings. 
  More than 300,000 young people will vote in the 1996 
elections, so Ramirez used Radio Sandino's microphones to send a 
message of hope and dreams to adolescents who were born not 
knowing of the Somoza period and who will vote for the first 
time that year. 
  Sergio supported consolidating the unity of the FSLN and 
said 
the existence of currents within the FSLN "are mere indications 
of trends of thought, AND WHENEVER SOMEONE TALKS OF DIVISION 
AMONG THE CURRENTS, THIS IS A TIMID ATTEMPT TO HIDE THE SUN WITH 
ONE'S FINGER." [upper case as published] 
  The currents are not going to cause nor are they causing any 
division. "Division is caused by the unfit leadership of a 
party that has to win the elections," the Sandinist bloc chief 
said in fielding questions by station listeners, including by 
those who said they were "anti-Sandinists to the death." 
  During his appearance, Sergio Ramirez made an extensive 
analysis of what the concept of "vanguard" (call it National 
Directorate) was during the past decades, chiefly during the 
Somozist dictatorship, when the militants were totally hemmed 
in. "But now we do not have an armed party but, rather, a 
political party that needs to open up to society to win over the 
support of the thousands of people who will have to vote." 
  It is contradictory, therefore, that a party that wants to 
win should be closed, given that in order to win it has to do so 
in terms of the number of votes, not the quality of the votes, 
Ramirez said, explaining this entails an opening in the FSLN and 
the end of categories, "because nobody likes to be discriminated 
against, to be second- or third-rate militants, or to see some 
on the first or second floor while others are out on the street." 
  The view that the FSLN should continue to be ruled by a 
historic National Directorate that used military means to fight 
the dictatorship is inappropriate, "and that is why we need to 
create a new party based on massive affiliation that needs to 
have a national council of directors and not a historic National 
Directorate, because that structure corresponds to a phase 
superseded within the FSLN." 
  "Face to Face" host Orlando Gomez mentioned that 10 hours 
earlier Rene Vivas had said in the same radio station during the 
program "Eco News" that the proposal of a Sandinism ruled by the 
majority "is a trend that tends to make the FSLN shift to the 
right." 
  Commenting on Vivas' remarks, Ramirez said "I do not believe 
this is an ideological problem but, rather, a political 
problem," and if one is proposing democracy within a party and 
the proposal is regarded as a shift to the right, it seems to me 
this creates unnecessary confusion." 
  Talking about those who use insult and slander as weapons to 
disqualify others within the Sandinist debate, Ramirez said that 
was a mistake, because whenever there are insults, slanders, and 
disqualifications," that means someone ran out of arguments, and 
that is serious in a political discussion." 
  "I believe the party members are interested in hearing a 
discussion of ideas, although they may be contradictory, because 
we can reach through ideas new elements "that give us new unity 
within the party." "If I get called a rightist for expressing 
an idea, then the person on the other side already lost the 
discussion," Ramirez said, citing something Unan [National 
Autonomous University of Nicaragua] President Mariano Fiallos 
had said some years ago about two people who were holding a 
discussion. When one of them lost the argument, he said: "The 
truth is I will not continue to argue with you, because you are 
really ugly, and that is how the discussion ended." 
  The easy thing to do to downplay the political debate 
pertaining to the FSLN's future "is to simplify it by saying it 
is a struggle among individuals, and a struggle among 
individuals is not valid when dealing with matters as important 
as the ones we are experiencing within the FSLN." 
  This is a matter of positions "such as mine in favor of the 
overall renewal of the FSLN so that it will become a viable 
party in the face of society, attract voters, and cease to be a 
minority party, which is what it is following the 1990 
elections, so it can allow us to gather the different social 
groups of the many people who did not vote for the FSLN in 1990. 
[no closing quotation mark as published] 
  Sergio said the FSLN must proselytize, and "we must not be 
afraid of the world electoral proselytism, because we cannot 
return to a government through any means other than an election. 
To win the elections we need votes, and we will not win votes 
if we continue to isolate ourselves from society." 
  Topics such as relations were broached during the program. 
Ramirez said "this offends some within the FSLN ranks who claim 
to be anti-imperialists and yet have 10-year visas to enter the 
United States, whereas "some of us have trouble getting a visa 
for just one occasion." 
  Those irked by this topic, including people who have been 
born in, lived, and studied in the United States, "are the ones 
who do not accept the humble anti-imperialism that some of us 
Sandinists have shown during our work for national sovereignty." 
The FSLN deputy affirmed he is neither morbidly anti-imperialist 
nor a royalist [principista]. In conclusion, the Sandinist 
leader called on the members of his party to gain stature in the 
debates and not fall for provocations. To those who side with 
any line of thought, he said "the only advice I can give you is 
not to stop thinking. Never imagine others can think for you; 
do not mull over what others have mulled over before." 
  "What a person must not do is allow someone else to tell him 
what he should think. Do not allow someone to play cassettes in 
your head, because human beings are not tape players," Ramirez 
said.

<F P=106> [Part I of two-part article by Alejandro E. Martinez Cuenca] </F>
<H5>  [5 Apr p 7] </H5>
  [Text] As the month of March drew to a close, we once again 
saw the public agenda marked by debate on the economy. 
  Nevertheless, the most striking thing that happened all 
month 
long was a sinister and unnoticed circular that the recently 
appointed board of directors of the National Development Bank 
(BANADES) sent to all producers enjoying access to that 
institution's services. The circular in question stated that 
effective 31 March, two options were being presented for all 
credits heretofore contracted for: either seek the protection of 
clause on the maintenance of value at an annual rate of 14 
percent or, if the producer did not respond in writing before 
the fateful date in question, continuation of his credit without 
any maintenance of value, but at a new rate of interest that 
would no longer be 17 percent annually, but rather, 29 percent 
and subject to quarterly review! 
  After doing a lot of addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division, those who received the circular were surprised to 
see that no matter which of the two options offered by BANADES 
they chose, their individual situation would tend to get worse. 
They naively wondered whether the bank had not perhaps made a 
mistake because they were asking for help, not for their 
situation to get worse! 
  If, with a rate of 17 percent they were already on the brink 
of the abyss, either one of the two options now being presented 
to them was actually only asking whether they preferred to 
plunge to a valley a thousand meters below them or land in a 
rocky river 2,000 meters down! In either case, they would fall 
and be killed, no matter what! 
<H5>  Borrow 100 and Give Back 200 </H5>
  If the bank loaned a specific producer let us say 100,000 
cordobas in 1992 to make some improvements in his plan of 
production, a loan to be paid off in five years with a one-year 
deferment, the fateful notice informed him that, effective 31 
March, instead of repaying 167,997 cordobas for the 100,000 that 
the bank had loaned him in 1992, he now had the option of paying 
192,000 if he did not apply for the clause on the maintenance of 
value, or 196,000 if he did, in which case the reward would be 
that his interest would be lowered from 29 to 14 percent. 
  The lack of logic in the "logic" had peaked. The producer 
had 
merely to pick the type of terrain on which his dead body would 
finally rest! 
  In the meantime, the government insisted there was no other 
alternative because otherwise, it would have to grant subsidies 
or report losses causing it to fail to meet its commitments. 
Both government and private bankers backed the state's logic, 
arguing that it had to build up its capital and could not absorb 
losses incurred by keeping that body now on the brink of the 
abyss alive. 
  After all, for the "efficient" government technocracy and a 
few of those bankers, fate had decreed that death would indeed 
occur and they thought this was just fine. After all, they do 
not think the "productive" sector knows how to work, is 
inefficient, and lives off the trough, having started to do so 
long before 25 February! It has always done so, failing to pay 
back debts or its taxes and diverting securities. 
<H5>  Confidence? </H5>
  The logic that arises out of an understanding of the 
phenomenon of Nicaragua is that there are several reasons why 
the productive sector is broke. The undeniable fact is that it 
is broke and will require a great deal of effort and support if 
it is to become a driving force of the Nicaraguan economy. 
  In addition, an atmosphere of confidence must be created in 
the country in order to make it possible for the measures which 
the government is taking to yield fruit within an as-yet 
undetermined length of time. 
  And yet, what the circular did was to attack both premises, 
officially confirming that not even the government or its 
institutions have confidence in themselves. 
  If the producer in our example, which might be one of those 
affected by the new provision, is involved more in domestic 
production rather than in activities strictly aimed at exports, 
his calculations are in cordobas rather than dollars. He takes 
in and spends cordobas. Under the new BANADES policy, this same 
producer is being asked--if he does not opt for maintenance of 
value--to pay, rather than 67,997 cordobas in interest in six 
years (which is already killing him!), the sum of 92,000 
cordobas in six years, while also amortizing the 100,000 loaned 
to him. 
  If this producer should opt for the 14-percent rate, his 
interest payment will go from 67,997 to 69,354 cordobas. 
However, the principal he has to amortize would go from 100,000 
to 127,064, meaning that he would end up paying a total of 
196,419 cordobas. 
  In both cases, the bank and the government deplete the 
producer's capital! 
<H5>  [6 Apr p 9] </H5>
  [Text] In drawing up the table below, we based our figures 
on the assumption that during the 1994-1998 period, the policy 
of devaluation would continue as it has worked so far, with a 
slip of 12 percent in the rate of exchange annually. This would 
mean that, on 31 March of every year, the rate would be 7.28 per 
dollar in 1995, 8.15 in 1996, 9.13 in 1997, and 10.23 in 1998. 
  If the government had confidence in the soundness of its 
policies and we turned the payments into dollars based on the 
previously mentioned rates, the bank could even lower the 
17-percent interest rate without any maintenance of value and 
still recover the entire loan of 100,000 cordobas granted 
(equivalent to $20,000). This would be logical if what one 
wanted to do were to recapitalize the productive sector. For 
this precise purpose, the government takes in enormous amounts 
of foreign aid in gifts and on extremely soft terms. 
  As a result of the BANADES board of director's circular, a 
producer loaned the equivalent of $20,000 in 1992 is now being 
asked to pay, instead of the $22,037 that he would have to pay 
if the interest rate stayed at 17 percent and without any 
maintenance of value, the sum of $25,000 without applying for 
any maintenance value and nearly $25,200 with it. 
  In other words, there was no need to change the terms of the 
credits since, as demonstrated here, neither the government nor 
the bank lost anything based on the situation existing before 
the circular. 
  By its own action, BANADES has made it clear that: either 
they are not confident that the rate of exchange will behave in 
this manner--in which case it would be introducing a factor of 
great instability that attacks its own logic, by encouraging the 
people to doubt the magnitude of future devaluations--or the 
government and its institutions have truly not understood the 
meaning of the need to capitalize the sector called upon to be 
the driving force of the Nicaraguan economy. 
  If the priority is to save the productive sector, no one is 
asking who will pay for the medicine. After all, if we seek such 
a reply, we might come to the tragic conclusion that if this 
government cannot, then the best thing for it would be for the 
patient to die and get it over with! Which is unacceptable and 
demonstrates an absolute lack of logic. 
  If our producers have no capital left, the government must 
make a commitment to contribute to their capitalization. This 
cannot be done based on short-term planning or within the 
framework of an account-based, strictly commercial vision in 
which everything must come together simultaneously and without 
giving time a chance to do its work. It may be that today, 
applying medicine implies having to leave an account receivable 
for a later date in exchange for curing the patient. 
  This would be the most logical thing of all and yet they are 
asking precisely the opposite. What the notorious BANADES 
circular does is merely give them a choice of what type of bed 
their falling body will finally come to rest in, rather than the 
prospect of life and progress! 
<H5>  Finally, Some Advice </H5>
  Before choosing your final resting place, dear producer, I 
would advise you to consider the following: 
  1--The credits that you have received do not necessarily 
have 
the same makeup and structure. Consequently, analyze every 
credit individually before choosing a single option from those 
offered to you by the bank. You will find that no single rule is 
the best for all cases, except the rule telling you to get out 
of all the credits you can as soon as possible. 
  2--If your credit has at least five more years to run and 
amortization is set up to be accelerated in the final years, it 
will then be to your advantage to choose the option of not 
maintaining value even if you have to pay 29 percent in interest 
annually. However, if your amortization schedule is uniformly 
prorated, it may be more advantageous to choose the option of 
maintaining the value at 13 percent as your final resting place. 
  In either case, neither of the options is a good one, but 
one 
can at least choose the lesser evil!

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ricardo Alvarado N.] </F>
  [Text] No one doubts that industrialization may be the only 
option for achieving economic development; we cannot pin all our 
hopes on the primary sector (agriculture, livestock, etc.). 
There is no question that if we want to achieve a higher 
standard of living, we must build a sufficiently vigorous and 
original industrial network to take advantage of the country's 
natural advantages, and consequently, to contribute effectively 
to the growth of the gross domestic product [GDP]. 
  Thus, it is antitechnical and even counterproductive to 
expect that exporting a few nontraditional agricultural products 
or enthusiastically supporting the assembly line industry 
[maquiladora], especially if there is no accompanying transfer 
of technology, is the way to assume responsibility for integral 
development, a responsibility that we as a nation must assume 
for the benefit of present and future generations. The assembly 
line industry and feeble primary-sector exports are mere 
bandaids that temporarily and partially alleviate the crippling 
problems of hunger and unemployment. 
  A multitude of diagnoses show that the industrial sector in 
Nicaragua is going through a crisis, moving ever closer to 
extinction. Its share of the GDP has fallen from 31.8 percent in 
1978 to 17 percent in 1993, and its annual per-capita GDP income 
is now three times smaller than it was. And regardless of the 
many different controversies that may arise concerning the 
positive or negative aspects of the historic Common Market and 
the catalytic cotton parameter [as published], the fact is that 
in those years Nicaragua's industrialization process was 
experiencing tremendous growth; and in spite of the "import 
substitution," which has such a bad reputation among certain 
economists today, the existing industrial system provided a 
solid foundation of support for the country's economic 
development. 
  To be sure, adjustment policies have a direct and indirect 
impact on whether an industrialization process moves forward or 
backward. Yet it is clear to everyone that poor countries such 
as Nicaragua are meeting with mathematical precision all kinds 
of requirements with respect to eliminating subsidies and 
throwing the doors wide open to outsiders, knowing that no rich, 
developed country would destroy itself with the same 
restrictions. Quite the contrary, in those countries 
protectionism, tariffs, and technical regulations zealously 
guard the safety of the productive apparatus. 
  There are examples galore, and the adjustment program was 
not 
born yesterday, even in Nicaragua. Overcoming the adjustment 
successfully depends on the capacity, leadership, and creativity 
that the government must display to be a reformer without being 
an exterminator. It is not a question, therefore, of repeating 
the well-worn excuse that the government, in keeping with its 
neoliberal facade, should not intervene. Of course it has to 
intervene, and it should intervene, but as a genuine 
facilitator, promoter, and leader, not as a caudillo. 
The policies of the World Bank and the IMF may be inflexible, 
some might say brutal, but the government should not blame its 
"limitations" on external conditions. Rather, it should be 
sufficiently capable and intelligent to respond efficiently to 
its role as an active guiding force rather than a passive 
observer. Examples abound: In Chile, the "Chicago Boys" promoted 
the free market, but substitute "production" for the Chilean 
state's service capacity. And in Mexico, as Dr. Salinas himself 
has pointed out, "the decisions are made by the people, not the 
bureaucrats." In that country, local councils, invoking the 
participation of civil society, decide how the resources derived 
from privatization will be used. 
  In those countries, even though the governments are pursuing 
neoliberal policies, adjustment policies, or whatever, they are 
sensitive and astute enough to get the most out of the reforms 
to benefit their people. 
  In Nicaragua, a greater effort should be made to take on a 
creative role under the authority of a healthy leadership that 
exudes confidence. In the specific case of industry, the 
government must subsidize and protect, with finesse and cunning, 
but without severely disrupting the adjustment process. There 
are so many forms of subsidies that can allow our industry, 
especially small-scale industry, to recover gradually. It is 
unfair to expect the productive sector to pull itself up by its 
bootstraps. The government must compromise and accept that it 
"did not determine what, how, or how much to produce," it is 
philosophy, and only philosophy. 
  At first, the government must reach a consensus with 
industry 
leaders and agree on all pertinent measures to revive the sector 
and enable it to compete on an equal footing. Chile, Japan, 
Italy, and other countries did not necessarily build their 
industries by leaving them to their own devices. 
  Thus, the inflexibility of the World Bank or the IMF and the 
adjustment are not the sole, evil cause of our industrial 
depression, and the overall slump in production. The secret 
lies, simply, in knowing how to function as a real government, a 
creative and steadfast promoter and facilitator. A leader, not a 
caudillo. And apparently, there is still time to mend 
its ways.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Manuel Esquivel Acevedo] </F>
  [Text] I feel compelled to disagree totally with the 
opinion expressed by Attorney Juan A. Munguia, president of the 
National Development Bank. There are at least five factors that 
the government should be aware of before it reaches the 
conclusion that there are not enough funds in the National 
Development Bank for cotton production. 
  1. Is Mr. Munguia out of touch with reality? 
  Anyone who lives in Leon or Chinandega knows how serious the 
crisis is in this western region. The level of unemployment in 
areas where peasants are out of work is shocking, and 100,000 
manzanas of land lies fallow, out of production thanks to 
bureaucrats like this one. 
  2. The current neo-agricultural policy of the Development 
Bank: 
  This financial institution was founded to deal with sectors 
like cotton that have an impact on the country's economy. There 
are three factors that the governments' Economic and Productive 
Committee should be aware of: 
  a. Cotton is a crop that farmers are familiar with, and they 
have mastered the techniques of growing it. 
  b. According to German Technical Aid (GTZ), cotton is grown 
today with superior technology and at reasonable production 
costs. 
  c. The price of $76.60 per gold quintal, given current 
costs, 
makes this a profitable activity that would bring in substantial 
amounts of foreign exchange for the country. 
  3. The possibility of shoring up the cotton loan portfolio: 
  Cotton is a financial activity that is loaded down with 
balances and restructuring. Yet the international price could 
turn cotton into a profitable activity again and help cotton 
producers with their debts. It used to be said that "a cotton 
debt can only be paid with cotton." 
  4. The generation of employment in the western region: 
  The cultivation of cotton generates much direct and indirect 
employment, so there is an urgent need to create profitable 
initiatives that will create jobs. Besides, did not the current 
government promise the people prosperity? Is not the role of 
government to create jobs to benefit the poorest and neediest 
segments of society? This is an opportunity to make up for the 
negative consequences of the neoliberal financial policies that 
are so dehumanizing. 
  5. Set up a consultation with cotton experts: 
  The economic importance of this crop and the foreign 
currency 
that it can bring into the country mean that we need a more 
prudent consideration of the matter than an attorney can 
provide. I suggest that we consult with people who know the 
field and who can also help arrive at a more comprehensive, 
professional, and prudent decision based on consensus, rather 
than the decision made by Attorney Munguia, which I consider to 
be dogmatic and irresponsible. It should be noted that one 
swallow does not make a summer, and, on the other hand, the 
suggestion "Cobbler, stick to your last" comes to mind. 
  In conclusion: 

  -  I suggest that we pay more attention to the real plight of 
our people, who are jobless, hungry, poor, etc. This will only 
lead to social instability, and in short, a minimal private and 
foreign investment. 
  -  We need to orient our resources toward 
profitable initiatives that producers are familiar with and that 
can contribute to the improvement of the bank's cotton loan 
portfolio. 
  -  Unemployment in the western region and banking and 
financial reforms should not be handled in a dogmatic manner, or 
without consideration for the people's socioeconomic interests; 
the socioeconomic interests of everyone are one thing, and 
lending the bank's money to serve the interests of a single 
group is quite another. 
  -  Be open to the different options for 
financing cotton production, because peasant unemployment and 
idle land are not conducive to social stability; on the 
contrary, all social tension or social tranquility begins in the 
countryside.

  [Text] General Mario Rene Enriquez Morales, the national 
defense minister, announced yesterday that the Guatemalan Army 
has accepted the creation of a Truth Commission. Once 
installed, it must investigate the military institution and all 
those sectors that have collaborated with the guerrillas since 
1960. Several civilian and social organizations have requested 
that the creation of this commission be approved during the 
negotiation process ever since talks between the Government 
Peace Commission and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity 
(URNG) began in January. 
  However, before leaving his office at the National Palace, 
the minister said: "In order for this all to be fair and just, 
the commission, if approved, must specifically investigate those 
who have collaborated with the URNG and have remained anonymous 
for over 33 years." He gave no names when asked who he thought 
were collaborators, but listed, for example, students, 
professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and countries 
which have aided the subversives financially and intellectually. 
  He reaffirmed that the Army's true position has not changed 
inasmuch as it does not want to see any further polarization of 
the community. Enriquez stressed that he does not mind the 
commission being installed, as long as there are equal 
conditions for all parties. 
  Although the Information and Press Department of the Army 
remained totally quiet on whether they accept the Truth 
Commission or not, civilian groups insist that it is necessary 
for the country. They expressed their support for statements by 
Gen. Enriquez when he said that he did not want to see further 
polarization.

  [Text] Mexico City, 9 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) today in Mexico City 
dismissed the possibility of an immediate cease-fire 
declaration, thereby rejecting the position of the organized 
business leaders and Guatemalan Army. To attach utmost 
importance to their position is to reduce the negotiation "to a 
simple laying down of weapons by the URNG, without having 
resolved any of the causes that generated and perpetuates the 
armed conflict," the guerrillas said. 
  The Coordinating Committee of Farming, Commercial, 
Industrial, and Financial Associations and Guatemalan Defense 
Minister Mario Enriquez said last week that there must be a 
cease-fire before the peace dialogue resumes. 
  In a communique broadcast in Mexico City, the URNG General 
Command insisted that "a cease-fire declaration at this time 
will not resolve this problem," referring to the situation in 
the Central American country. The Guatemalan guerrillas also 
reiterated that the creation of a Truth Commission "is not only 
essential but unpostponable in view that it is a substantial 
component of eradicating impunity." 
  The government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and the 
URNG are scheduled to meet in Oslo, Norway, at the end of May. 
In March, they agreed that in the meeting they will discuss the 
establishment and operation of this commission. 
  The release of the rebel document coincided with remarks by 
De Leon Carpio, who in San Jose, Costa Rica, viewed as 
inadvisable the creation of the commission because it might 
deepen wounds and hinder the peace negotiations. For the URNG, 
the president has "only one choice" and that "is to fulfill and 
enforce the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and give 
concrete signs of wanting to achieve progress in the 
negotiation." 
  The government and the URNG have been engaged in a process 
of 
talks aimed at ending an armed conflict that, according to 
humanitarian organizations, has left about 175,000 dead in 34 
years.

  [Text] Yesterday, in an appearance before the Congress of 
the Republic, Foreign Relations Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman 
confirmed that Guatemala still maintains its territorial claims 
over Belize and plans to allow the people to voice their opinion 
on the issue by means of a referendum. 
  During a meeting with the Foreign Relations Committee, the 
minister explained that no unexpected readjustments to the 
guidelines of the dispute with the Belizean people are expected 
to take place during her term as minister and that they are 
prepared to resort to any legal means in order to resolve the 
dispute. 
  As established by the Constitution, after the Belize Council 
has been established, one of the points to be put on its agenda 
will be to request the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to call the 
Guatemalan people to a referendum so they may voice their 
opinion on the issue. 
  Even though the minister indicated that the Belize Council 
will be directly responsible for negotiating the territorial 
dispute, she also explained that at any given moment it could 
request mediation by the international community, which has 
expressed interest in the problem. 
  In addition, the United Nations will be made aware of the 
objectives sought by the proviso submitted a few months ago. 
  With respect to the extradition of [former President] Jorge 
Serrano Elias, the minister indicated that the court responsible 
for the case has not yet forwarded any [extradition] request to 
the Foreign Ministry. 
<H5>  Belize Council To Be Established in 10 Days </H5>
  The foreign minister stated that the Belize Council will be 
established in no less than 10 days. She also abstained from 
identifying the candidates selected to become members of the 
aforementioned council and indicated that there are still talks 
to be held with some of them in order to confirm their 
disposition to participate. 
  According to the foreign minister, a preliminary list of 
candidates has already been discussed with President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio, and, if there are no objections, she would proceed 
to forward invitations to the citizens named as possible council 
members.

  [Text] Henry W. Anderson, Belizean ambassador to Guatemala, 
yesterday said his government is prepared to begin negotiations 
on the territorial dispute with Guatemala; adding that a 
commission has been created for this purpose and only the final 
details must be settled. 
  The Guatemalan Government has recognized Belize's 
independence; therefore, we have accepted the fact that a border 
dispute prevails between the two countries, a situation we hope 
will be handled cordially, he said. Regarding the 
organization of a Belizean Council, the ambassador said this is 
considered positive because it is a sign the Guatemalan 
Government is prepared to begin negotiations to settle the 
dispute. 
  Belize is interested in establishing trade, cultural, 
and sports relations, not only with Guatemala but with all of 
Central America; and that is one of the reasons that prompt us 
to be prepared to negotiate what is negotiable, Anderson 
said. The ambassador also said he cannot release the names of 
the persons who make up the Belizean commission that will 
participate in the negotiations, because he does not have them. 
  He also referred to the role played by the media in the 
case, 
which is important, to establish the objective atmosphere 
necessary to settle relations between the States of Guatemala 
and Belize. The diplomat added that Belize's recognition as an 
independent state by the media, and the illustration of this on 
the region's maps, will represent a great step forward.

<F P=106> [News conference with President-elect Ernesto Perez </F>
Balladares by unidentified domestic and foreign correspondents 
at the presidential palace in Panama City; broadcast in progress 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Perez Balladares] ...he fulfilled his promise and 
we discussed the transition and the teams that will work 
together to complete that transition within the deadline 
established by the law, so that on 1 September we will not have 
to delay state affairs due to a lack of knowledge about them. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Perez] Pardon me? 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Perez] We will do that as often as necessary, of course. 
  [Correspondent] Will you (?begin working) prior to 1 
September? 
  [Perez] No, no, no. The president is president until 1 
September. We must respect him as president of the Republic 
until 1 September, and after that as former president. 
  [Correspondent] What mechanisms will be used for the 
transition? 
  [Perez] Teams will be formed and they will work together 
from 
now until 1 September, thereby ensuring a trauma-free transition. 
  [Correspondent] Is it true that your government will have 
another type of team apart from the Democratic Revolutionary 
Party? 
  [Perez] I have said I will form a broad-based government, if 
that is what you are referring to. We are still working on that. 
  [Correspondent] Doctor, what about the future of government 
employees? 
  [Perez] At ease. I have no doubt whatsoever that the 
government employees know perfectly well that I intend to 
respect them and to hasten as much as possible the approval of 
the administrative career. 
  [Correspondent] Dr. Balladares, what will relations with the 
United States be like? 
  [Perez] We hope they will be elevated in character because 
our countries are united by common interests. I do not have the 
slightest doubt that this will be the case and that between the 
two countries we will do things to improve the Panamanian 
people's lives. 
  [Correspondent] President Carter said today that President 
Clinton's prospective ambassador to Panama is Robert Pastor. 
What do you think of that? 
  [Perez] I do not know. President Endara and his 
administration will have to decide that. I will respect their 
decision. 
  [Correspondent] Endara said he was delaying the (?angry man) 
until after the elections. 
  [Perez] The elections are over. 
  [Correspondent] Can you tell us how these teams will work? 
Will they be part of a ministry or independent? 
  [Perez] They will be appointed by President Endara and I and 
they will work together so that we will keep abreast of matters 
pending completion. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Perez] No, no, no. Outside. [Word indistinct] the 
presidency. 
  [Correspondent] There is a fear of a return of militarism. 
This was the first weapon used by your political opponents. 
  [Perez] Looking at your pants, yes. 
  [Correspondent] Doctor, what about relations with Cuba? 
  [Perez] Relations with Cuba will be exactly like relations 
with any other country in the world. I hope they will be 
elevated in character and respectful; each country has its 
political system and I demand respect for both. In other words, 
they must not meddle in our affairs, nor we in theirs.

<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares by </F>
correspondent Veronica Duran; place and date not given; from the 
"CMI Newscast" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Perez Balladares] Torrijos always said we had two 
countries with which we sleep every day: Colombia and Costa 
Rica. Of course, they are our neighbors, and we want to have 
very close, cordial, and helpful relations with them. 
  [Duran] What will be your position vis-a-vis the United 
States? 
  [Perez Balladares] One of respect. I believe the 
Torrijos-Carter Treaties are our best references. We, as well 
as the United States, know that respect is the best way to 
ensure good relations and that the implementation of and 
compliance with those treaties are fundamental to positive 
relations between our countries. 
  [Duran] Is it true that Panama is a U.S. puppet? 
  [Perez Balladares] No, God forbid. We, however, do have many 
joint interests in the Panama Canal enterprise. Those interests 
will continue, but with the difference that the Canal will now 
be managed entirely by Panamanians. No, Panama is not a U.S. 
puppet. 
  [Duran] Does the United States influence the government in 
any way? 
  [Perez Balladares] The current government? 
  [Duran] Yes. 
  [Perez Balladares] Well, you will have to ask the president 
that question. In my administration, there will be a great deal 
of respect and consideration, but no influence. 
  [Duran] Do you see any political future for [presidential 
candidate Ruben] Blades? 
  [Perez Balladares] I believe that, in addition to youth, 
some 
political experience is required, and Ruben, who is my friend 
and whose music I enjoy, does not have it. I, of course, offer 
him the opportunity to acquire this experience during my 
government.

<F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares early this morning visited 
Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon, the outstanding opponent of the 
military regime that ruled this country until 1989. "Telemetro 
Reports" has an exclusive report. 
  Ernesto Perez Balladares, virtual president elect, made his 
first visit this morning to Christian Democratic leader Ricardo 
Arias Calderon. Perez Balladares paid his respects to the man 
he called one of the main champions of democracy in Panama. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Dr. Perez 
Balladares, why are you visiting Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon? 
  [Perez Balladares] Dr. Arias Calderon has been an 
outstanding 
champion of democracy in Panama. I have been favored by an 
electoral process held in a time of democracy. I wanted to tell 
Dr. Arias Calderon, and I have done so, that he can rest assured 
that we are also committed to democracy. In addition, with this 
small gesture, I want to tell the country that we are moved by 
the best spirit of national reconciliation. There are neither 
vanquished nor victors in Panama. I think all Panamanians have 
won, and naturally there is no hatred or rancor. We are 
planning to work, everyone united, to attain our national goals. 
I wanted to come and tell Ricardo about this. 
  [Reporter] In a few months you are going to take over as 
president of the Republic. Are you going to rule with opposing 
parties in view of the election results? 
  [Perez Balladares] I want to invite all Panamanians, 
regardless of their political inclination, to make this 
government what the country needs to enter the 21st century 
united. That means -- and I am not evading your question -- 
that I am going to invite some people who have been my 
adversaries and some who belong to other political parties to 
form part of the government. I think it is necessary. I am 
fully aware of the fact that two-thirds of Panamanians chose 
other candidates. It is true that I have won, but two-thirds of 
the Panamanians saw better things in other candidates. I have to 
accept that with much humility, and therefore I want to form a 
government that will reflect that national feeling. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon, you have just heard 
Dr. Perez Balladares' opinion. What do you have to say about 
this visit and about the other things that only you and Dr. 
Perez Balladares discussed? 
  [Arias Calderon] For 21 years I struggled against the 
dictatorship so we could live in democracy. Now that democracy 
has born fruit in the most honest and peaceful elections that we 
have had for as long as I can recall, I admit that he has won 
the elections honestly and that he is the president-elect of 
Panama. I appreciate his visit to my home. He has given me the 
opportunity to talk with him about national problems, about 
things that worry the people, such as keeping public security 
demilitarized. He has reiterated his pledge to me -- just like 
he has done to the country -- that it will be that way. I have 
strengthened his concern about the administration of justice, 
that it must be handled so their is not the slightest suspicion 
of bias or politics. That is something that the country needs. 
I have spoken of the need for a joint effort, just like he has 
spoken of it, for an economic development that will stamp out 
unemployment and help the thousands of men and women who are 
jobless. 
  We also spoke about how to prepare the country to manage the 
Canal. I think the president-elect is looking to the future. I 
am certainly looking toward the future. I will support all 
measures that are positive for Panama, and I will practice a 
democratic and constructive criticism in everything that I 
believe can be improved. He has invited me to voice my opinions 
frankly, and I have done so. I appreciate his kind gesture today. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Arias Calderon, in the face of this joint 
task ahead for the president-elect, did he make any offer for 
the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] to rule jointly with the 
PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] in the pursuit of better 
social programs for the country? 
  [Arias Calderon] We did not talk about political offers 
because that does not concern me. I am not the PDC president. 
The party president is Raul Ossa, and the PDC candidate is 
Eduardo Vallarino. I have spoken as one Panamanian to another, 
as a Panamanian who struggled for democracy with a Panamanian 
who has been democratically elected president. We have not 
discussed offers at all; that was not part of the agenda. [end

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" of news conference by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, </F>
presidential candidate for the Democratic Alliance, with 
unidentified reporters at the Arnulfist Party headquarters in 
Panama City -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Moscoso] I have called you to a news conference 
today on behalf of the Democratic Alliance to publicly 
congratulate Ernesto Perez Balladares on his victory in the 
presidential elections. In addition, I want to publicly 
recognize and congratulate the president of the Republic for 
giving us peaceful, democratic elections, the likes of which we 
have not seen in many years. We wish Ernesto Perez Balladares 
and his new government team success. 
  [Reporter] What will the political future of the Arnulfist 
Party [PA] and the Democratic Alliance be? 
  [Moscoso] We had a wonderful campaign with the Democratic 
Alliance and have shown that opinion polls were completely 
manipulated here. The figures we are seeing today, which 
represent 90 percent of the votes, show that we are only 4 
percent behind Perez Balladares and that we were the party in 
second place, that we were always behind the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party]. We will remain united. This alliance 
will stay united. Of course we will have legislators in the 
next Legislative Assembly, and the Democratic Alliance will work 
together. 
  [Reporter] How does the PA view the future of our country 
under a party like the PRD, which previously held the government 
in our country? 
  [Moscoso] Of course the PA views the PRD with some concern 
after the experience of previous years. Nevertheless, we hope 
that Perez Balladares will be accompanied by the best men and 
that he will govern for the people and not for a party. 
  [Reporter] Perez Balladares said he wants a government in 
coalition with all parties and urged them to participate. Would 
the PA be willing to participate in a PRD government? 
  [Moscoso] First we would have to receive that invitation 
from Perez Balladares and then consult with the National 
Directorate of my party. I cannot answer that question now.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jose Salvador Munoz, president of the </F>
Doctrinaire Panamenist Party, by unidentified correspondent; 
place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Correspondent] Can you give us your opinion on the 
electoral process yesterday? 
  [Munoz] I gladly take this opportunity to address the 
Panamanian people and to congratulate them on my own behalf and 
on that of my party for the civic spirit demonstrated yesterday. 
It shows that we have matured a great deal. I hope that the 
same civic spirit displayed yesterday will serve all of us 
Panamanians to demand that our government leaders keep their 
promises. 
  We now have two processes: We concluded one, which was to 
elect our government leaders. The next one, the next stage of 
this democratic process, is to demand of our government leaders 
the fulfillment of the mandate we have bestowed on them. I am 
drafting a note to Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares congratulating 
him on his victory and reminding him that our country faces 
serious problems in the next five years and that all Panamanians 
hope he will always act in the interests of our fatherland. 
  [Correspondent] There are many people in Panama, especially 
the adversaries of Dr. Perez Balladares, who believe that the 
PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] -- which we assume won the 
elections -- could signify a return to militarism, reprisals, 
and persecution. How do you view the PRD's return to power? 
  [Munoz] I have no doubt whatsoever that some people will try 
to collect on the debts they are owed, so to speak. 
Nevertheless, I think that Dr. Perez Balladares has enough 
talent to realize that such a situation in Panama would cause a 
confrontation. He must also understand that even though he won, 
he has 70 percent of the people against him. He won with 30 
percent of the votes, which we must respect and support, but he 
also has 70 percent of the people against him. I don't think 
that he, being the talented man that he is, would allow the 
feelings or the political misconceptions of some party member to 
create a situation for him that would provoke a confrontation, 
which would make it even more difficult for his government. I 
don't think that will happen. 
  [Correspondent] Do you consider yourself part of the 
opposition to Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares? 
  [Munoz] I am another Panamanian who headed a political 
party. 
I am waiting with my party for a reasonable time period to pass 
to take the political measures we consider advisable. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you for your statements to Radio KW 
Continente. 
  [Munoz] Thank you again for the opportunity to reiterate my 
message to the people congratulating them for the way they 
behaved yesterday and to remind them that it is the people's 
obligation not only to vote but to demand of their government 
leaders fulfillment of their promises and, therefore, to demand 
their attention whenever they deem it necessary. Thank you very 
much.

<F P=106> [Statement by Guillermo Quijano, Change `94 vice </F>
presidential candidate, at campaign headquarters in Panama City 
-- live] 
  [Text] Citizens: The current times require a great deal of 
reflection and positive attitudes for the the nation's future. 
Change `94 presented to the voters the best government program 
to be implemented by a team of men and women individually and 
collectively qualified. This is very true in terms of ability, 
proven honesty, and democratic convictions. 
  The nation will be ruled, starting on 1 September, by a 
mandate of a minority of the voters in keeping with our current 
laws. Change `94 becomes, as of this moment, a constructive and 
overseeing opposition that will guarantee the necessary balance 
to watch over the democratic system and the honest execution of 
government actions. 
  We are very proud of the work we carried out and of the 
plans 
we presented to the nation. We give our eternal and sincere 
appreciation to the thousands of Panamanians who believed in us 
and who supported our electoral plans and proposals. The 
political support we received represents the desire of those who 
wished to guarantee the nation's best interests, and that gives 
us peace of mind as citizens. 
  We recognize the national government for offering the nation 
a clean and transparent electoral process, thereby imposing on 
the newly elected government the commitment to do the same in 
1999. We admire and respect our political allies, friends, and 
associates for all their work and efforts. Once again, we are 
satisfied because we have served Panama while reiterating our 
firm willingness to continue to do so. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Guillermo Endara with foreign </F>
and domestic correspondents at the Presidential Palace in Panama 
City on 9 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Radio KW Continente correspondent Carmen 
Villamonte] President Endara, Mrs. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber has 
formally conceded Ernesto Perez Balladares' electoral victory. 
What is your opinion on this and what future do you see for the 
Arnulfist Party? 
  [Endara] Ernesto Perez Balladares' victory is 
unquestionable. 
Dona Mireya has recognized this because she is an honest 
politician who believes in and defends the truth. She does not 
believe in maintaining an air of uncertainty. Furthermore, this 
democracy we saw in full bloom yesterday, and of which all 
Panamanians are proud, needs candidates such as her, who can 
tell the truth for the good of the nation. I congratulate her 
for this. 
  I also recognize Perez Balladares' victory. To prove this, I 
have invited Mr. Perez to come and talk with me. In the first 
place I will congratulate him and then I wish to offer him a 
transition mechanism to ensure that the transfer of power can be 
accomplished most efficiently. When he assumes power on 1 
September he will be aware of everything and anything about 
public administration he so desires. 
  [Villamonte] How do you view the fact that the government 
parties were unable to unite to face the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party [PRD]? 
  [Endara] I believe it was because of the stubbornness of one 
man, who believed himself to be superior to all other 
Panamanians. I am especially fond of this man, but I believe he 
was responsible for the Civilists not retaining power. 
  [Villamonte] The Arnulfist Party has said it will become an 
opposition party and Mr. Ruben Carles has said he will lead that 
opposition party. 
  [Endara] We Arnulfists, and I speak as one because I can now 
that the election is over, cannot accept any leadership other 
than an Arnulfist leadership. I can tell you that, although 
Mireya is the one who should, because she is the leader of the 
party and the president. I, as an Arnulfist, submit myself to 
her authority. 
  [Villamonte] Mr. Perez Balladares.... 
  [Unidentified correspondent, interrupting] [Question 
indistinct] 
  [Endara] I wanted to address that issue, and I would like to 
do that now. I think that there was a lot of emphasis placed on 
the fact that the elections were very good, and they were. This 
is reason enough to be proud. 
  We are proud of the elections, but there is something that 
happened in the election campaign and on the same day of the 
elections that is worthy of being criticized, that is worthy of 
being criticized. [repeats himself] In this regard I believe 
the election polls turned out to be what we were claiming. They 
were totally manipulated and were fraudulent. They were 
manipulated to make people believe that the one who actually 
came in fourth place was in second place. The one who was in 
first place actually came in first place and in that regard the 
polls were not manipulated, but the polls made people believe 
that his lead was very large. Those polls were manipulated 
against Mireya Moscoso de Gruber to favor the person who 
actually came in fourth place. It was obvious, obvious that the 
polls were manipulated and fraudulent. After meditating on it 
for a while, I do not think we could prohibit polls because we 
would restrict freedom of expression and that is inadvisable 
under any concept. Freedom of expression cannot be repressed. 
I believe, however, that the Panamanian people must learn the 
lesson of 1994 and when the 1999 elections come they should pay 
no attention to the polls whatsoever because those polls are 
conducted by persons without any scruples to fool the people. 
  [Villamonte] [Question indistinct] 
  [Endara] I am going to propose the topic of the transition. 
That is the fundamental topic I am going to propose. I believe 
Dr. Perez Balladares may want to talk about some topics that may 
interest him. I will gladly answer his questions. It is a 
meeting without an agenda, we can say. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, do you believe 
that with a PRD government back in power, freedoms will be 
restricted? 
  [Endara] I must confess that for a long time I feared this 
would occur. Today I am cautiously optimistic, optimistic with 
reservations, that Dr. Perez Balladares has good intentions. I 
hope he will fulfill his promise to maintain this democracy and 
the country's freedoms. I hope we do not return to the military 
times. I sincerely believe, it but I must admit that the 
optimism is under inventory benefit, as lawyers say. I and 
other Panamanians are going to be vigilant and I hope the media 
will also be vigilant, taking care of our freedoms and our 
democracy, which we cannot lose. While Perez Balladares remains 
on the path of democracy, respect for freedom, respect for 
civilist or nonmilitary ideas, we are not going to be an 
obstacle. 
  On the contrary, we will do everything within our power to 
contribute, but if he strays from that path you can rest assured 
there will be a group of Panamanians to oppose him and the 
Arnulfist Party will be in that group. We will firmly oppose 
any deviation from the proper path.

  [Text] In violation of electoral provisions, some PRD 
[Democratic Revolutionary Party] candidates in various electoral 
districts offered to buy votes with payments ranging from 
$20-$30 per vote. This was also an old practice of ousted 
General Manuel Antonio Noriega's associates. The Office of the 
Electoral Prosecutor should immediately conduct a detailed 
investigation of this crime. The purchase of votes occurred in 
Cabuya, Anton... Parque Lefevre... Rio Abajo, as well as in 
David and Puerto Armuelles. [ellipses as published] 
  At the Salinera voting table in Nata, even presidential 
ballots were stolen. These ballots, according to what was 
learned, were removed by PRD activists. Also, in Chitre, Ocu, 
and Parita, PRD activists protested at several voting stations 
with other parties. The PRD activists arrived at the time of 
closing of the voting tables to cast their votes, which is 
illegal.

monitor the Panamanian elections by the Episcopal Conference of

May; read by former Colombian President Belisario Betancur --

  [Text] We, the 11 observers from Latin America and Europe 
invited by the Episcopal Conference of Panama and the Justice 
and Peace Commission of Panama, have had the opportunity to 
observe the electoral process in the Republic of Panama for one 
week. Upon concluding our mission, we hereby forward the

  1. We were provided with all of the information we needed to 
learn about the country's electoral system. Furthermore, we 
were able to interview and obtain information from members of 
the Justice and Peace Commission itself, as well as other 
electoral experts. They briefed us on electoral legislation and 
practices in Panama. 
  2. The Magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal welcomed us on 
several occasions to fully explain the system of guarantees and 
controls established to ensure the Panamanian people's 
democratic participation in the election and the respect for the 
will of the people as reflected in the polls. We would like to 
express our highest praise and strongest applause for the 
Electoral Tribunal for its impeccable performance during this 
important task in the interest of the country. 
  3. We examined the procedures that guaranteed a swift and 
trustworthy vote count. Our highest congratulations go to the 
National Vote-Counting Board and to the Justice and Peace 
Commission. 
  4. We interviewed the presidential candidates. We discussed 
their platforms, their willingness to respect the final results 
of the elections, and their willingness to offer the winner 
their personal cooperation and the cooperation of their 
respective parties. We thank the candidates for finding time in 
their very busy schedules to see us. 
  5. On 8 May, the team of international observers visited 
various areas of the country. The idea was to confirm election 
results directly. Thanks to the Justice and Peace Commission's 
excellent planning and the outstanding cooperation offered by 
those Panamanians who accompanied us during this time, we were 
able to visit a large number of voting tables all across the 
country. 
  There, we observed the smooth progression of Election Day 
events, from the opening of the voting tables to the closure and 
tallying process. We did not observe one case in which there 
was any evidence of an attempt to distort the will of the 
Panamanian people. We believe that the legal mechanisms, the 
instructional efforts prior to the election, and the people's 
enormous desire to participate freely and democratically made it 
possible to experience an Election Day we can only describe as 
exemplary. 
  6. As international observers fulfilling our mission, we 
hereby state before the international community and the 
Panamanian public that the 8 May 1994 elections in the Republic 
of Panama were carried out with all necessary guarantees. The 
process has allowed the people of Panama to express their 
political will in complete freedom. 
  7. Last, we ask that all Panamanians and their political 
leaders unite and build an even more just, free, and fraternal 
Panama -- a Panama capable of resolving its domestic problems, 
particularly poverty, while broadening its relations of peace 
and cooperation with the countries of the region and the 
international community in general. 
  To do so, Panamanian society, led by its political 
authorities with the support of the Catholic Church and the 
Justice and Peace Commission, and within the framework of the 
Ibero-American nations' will to build and strengthen their 
democratic systems, must be aware of challenges as outlined by 
the admirable Panamanian people, who expressed their will with 
outstanding civic and democratic maturity. To all of the 
Panamanian people, we wish to express our admiration and 
gratitude.

parties, visited the government authorities, the presidential 
candidates, and the Electoral Tribunal [TE] to explain the 
objectives of the observers. On 12 May [as heard] the OAS 
observers were sent to eight of the nine provinces in the 
Republic of Panama. 
  On 8 May the 27 observers started working early in the

voting tables. The observers focused their attention on the 
conditions that surrounded the installation of the voting 
tables; the actual voting process; and the vote count at the 
voting tables, the Electoral District Vote-Counting Board, and 
the National Vote-Counting Board. The OAS observers were also 
alert to information provided by the TE on the election results. 
  The OAS observers coordinated its task with other groups of 
international observers, especially with the group headed by 
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, in an attempt to expand the 
coverage of the observers and exchange information and views on

  Following receipt of the first reports from observers in the 
various provinces, the mission can announce the following 
preliminary conclusions: 
  1. All candidates had every guarantee to develop his or

process by the TE created an environment of trust among the 
political forces and the people regarding the cleanliness of the 
elections. 
  3. The people had every guarantee to vote freely and 
express their political will. The voting was conducted within a 
framework of calm and cordiality and was highlighted by a high 
degree of participation. 
  4. The isolated problems were solved promptly and did not 
hinder the voting. 
  5. The vote count began as scheduled at the Electoral 
District Vote-Counting Board. 
  The OAS observers will remain in Panama until the TE 
releases 
the final results of the vote count for president and vice 
presidents. 
  Lastly, at the appropriate time, the secretary general will

  [Text] Panama City, 9 May (DPA) -- Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, virtual Panamanian president-elect, confirmed today 
that Gabriel Lewis Galindo will serve as foreign minister in his 
cabinet. 
  Galindo, brother of Samuel Lewis Galindo -- beer businessman 
and one of the six presidential candidates who lost in 
yesterday's elections -- was one of the Panamanian negotiators 
of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties in 1977 and one of the main 
opponents of former dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
  Perez Balladares, who confirmed the report published by LA 
ESTRELLA DE PANAMA about the list of possible ministers, said 
the posts of attorney general; comptroller; and ministers of the 
Presidency, agricultural development, education, health, and 
foreign relations will be offered to political figures who do 
not belong to his Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). The 
victorious candidate said the Housing, Public Works, Labor and 
Social Welfare, Commerce and Industries, Planning, and 
Government and Justice Ministries might be occupied by PRD 
members. In this way, the future president kept his campaign 
promise to appoint a cabinet with an undetermined number of 
opposition and independent members. 
  Perez Balladares said current magistrates Eduardo Valdes, 
Dennis Allen, and Guillermo Marquez will be retained in the 
Electoral Tribunal. Jose de los Santos Chen Barria of the 
Christian Democratic Party may be confirmed as comptroller. The 
Attorney General's Office will be occupied by Jose Antonio 
Sossa, another PDC member, and Oswaldo Fernandez, who was 
appointed by President Endara as head of the Public Force, will 
retain his post. 
  Stanley Muschett, president of the Justice and Peace 
Commission and rector of the private Santa Maria la Antigua 
University, will occupy the post of education minister, while 
Carlos Souza, former president of the Cattlemen's Association, 
will hold the post of agricultural development minister. Also, 
veteran Liberal Party politician Raul Arango will be designated 
Presidency minister and Carlos Garcia de Paredes, former dean of 
the School of Medicine of the University of Panama, will be 
appointed health minister. 
  Two PRD members will be appointed commerce and industries 
minister and government and justice ministers: livestock 
businessman Felix Gonzalez and the PRD's leftist First Assistant 
Secretary Mitchel Doens, respectively. Two women will be named 
to the posts of labor and social welfare minister and economic 
planning minister, but their names were not disclosed by Perez 
Balladares. 
  After learning of his triumph, Perez Balladares said: "The 
era of electoral confrontation has passed, and we must enter the 
21st century with a vision of the future and with the commitment 
to our children and grandchildren, without returning to the past 
and without links to the past."

the Change `94 coalition by an unidentified reporter; place not

  [Text] [Reporter] Professor Carles, would you be willing to 
participate in the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] 
government, should you be invited to do so? 
  [Carles] I have no personal interest in participating in any 
government. As president, I would have had the opportunity and 
the authority to do the things that we had proposed, and that we 
had planned, [words indistinct] I do not believe I could 
transfer those goals, that vision, and that determination to any 
group. Political problems will have to be resolved in another 
manner, not through my individual participation. That is 
another issue altogether. We are going to have to unite as 
Panamanians to safeguard justice, liberty, and democracy in this 
country. 
  I invite Ruben Blades to stay here in Panama to fight for 
Panamanians. This is why Blades said as a candidate that: This 
is the time to face problems and to struggle for justice, 
freedom, and democracy... [pauses] and for all those other 
things that were not very clear in his speeches.

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega for the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate of 
the United People alliance, went to the San Fernando Hospital 
for a drug test, which came out negative. Perez Balladares 
stressed that if he wins the presidential elections, he will 
implement a vigorous policy against drug trafficking. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] I came for a drug test 
because I think the Panamanian people have the right to demand 
and to know whether their candidates are using chemical 
substances. I also had a stress test because I think the next 
president should have enough physical stamina and be in good 
enough health to keep the promises made to the Panamanian people. 
  [Ortega] Could this be viewed as a prelude to your 
government's policy against drugs? 
  [Perez Balladares] You can be sure that if I took the test, 
I 
will demand that everyone else do likewise. 
  [Ortega] How do you view this final stretch only a few days 
before the elections? 
  [Perez Balladares] I am very pleased. Thankfully, I think it 
has been a first-rate campaign during which we have not insulted 
anyone but have proposed solutions. I honestly think it is going 
to conclude on Sunday with a great civic festival for all 
Panamanians. We are very happy and proud to have participated in 
it. 
  [Ortega] Some say that the Cubans are giving you a hand in 
this campaign? 
  [Perez Balladares] I think the party has already stated 
clearly that this is a lie made up by political adversaries. Of 
course, it is completely false, completely false. Our party 
told the Justice and Peace Commission two or three weeks ago 
that such a falsehood would be fabricated. They are holding the 
documents that show this is a lie. 
  [Ortega] Why did you take the drug test? Have other 
candidates done the same? 
  [Perez Balladares] I hope we all do it. I think it should be 
done as a sign of respect for the Panamanian people so they can 
be sure that none of us use any type of chemical substance. [end 
recording] 
  Shortly before meeting with a group of international 
observers at midday, Perez Balladares said today he will 
announce the list of three attorneys from among whom he will 
choose the new attorney general of the Republic if he is elected 
president. 
  [Begin Balladares recording] I plan to keep my promise and 
name three citizens from among whom I plan to select an attorney 
general in January 1995. That is when the attorney general must 
be appointed and his name sent to the Legislative Assembly. One 
of those three citizens will be chosen to head the list. I will 
ask the other two to be alternates. [end recording] 
  Perez Balladares could make this announcement tonight at 
2100 
in a speech to be aired over RPC Television.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 9 May (NOTIMEX) -- A former officer 
of the defunct Panama Defense Forces (FDP) said here today that 
Panamanian military officers exiled in Guatemala could return to 
Panama following the election victory of opposition presidential 
candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares. 
  "We will return when the victory of Perez Balladares in the 
general elections held this Sunday is confirmed," former FDP 
Lieutenant Carlos Alberto Rumbo told NOTIMEX. 
  The military officer said the young officers of the defunct 
Panamanian Army "will return to give back to Panama its dignity, 
which General Manuel Noriega, President Guillermo Endara, and 
the Americans trampled on." 
  At least 10 Panamanian military officers sought exile in 
various Latin American countries following the U.S. invasion in 
December 1989, which overthrew Noriega. Noriega was later 
sentenced to 40-years of incarcaration in the United States for 
drug trafficking activities. 
  Rumbo said he fled Panama after participating in a 
post-invasion, uprising by National Police members against 
President Endara; an uprising which Endara described as a "coup 
attempt." 
  Perez Balladares, from the United People coalition headed by 
the Democratic Revolutionary Party, became the virtual winner of 
the Panamanian presidential elections. 
  Perez Balladares, popularly known as "El Toro", has remained 
in first place with approximately 33 percent of the vote since 
the Electoral Tribunal (TE) started providing election results 
yesterday. 
  After 89 percent of the votes were counted, the TE placed 
Mireya Moscoso de Gruber from the ruling Arnulfist Party in 
second place with 28 percent of the votes. She was followed by 
Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement, who gained 17 percent 
of the vote. 
  Regarding these figures, Guatemalan analyst Walter Robles 
said "Toro's" victory was the result of his ability to renew 
Panamanians' affinity for the policies of the PRD founder, the 
late General Omar Torrijos. 
  During the election campaign, PRD leaders were able to 
remove 
the party from the shadow of deposed General Manuel Noriega, who 
became Panama's "strongman" following the death of Torrijos in 
1981, according to Robles. 
  Panamanian writer Rafael Ruiloba said the new government 
must 
find the best way to lead the country down a nationalist path 
and the best way to recover the dignity lost following the 
humiliating U.S. invasion. 
  In San Salvador, the country's media reported on the virtual 
victory of the PRD candidate in Sunday's elections, in which 
deputies and mayors were also elected. 
  Conservative newspaper LA PRENSA GRAFICA printed on its 
front 
page: "Perez Balladares Virtual Winner of Elections in Panama," 
and right-wing newspaper EL DIARIO DE HOY published: "Balladares 
Wins Elections in Panama."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 May (NA) -- Today, Vice Foreign 
Minister Fernando Petrella warned that Argentina "cannot 
maintain a rigid position" regarding the draft Pharmaceutical 
Patents Law, at least "on the basis of the current situation." 
He made it clear that his evaluation is "entirely personal." 
  Petrella told a radio station that Brazil reached "an 
agreement, which has yet to be formalized, with U.S. authorities 
with an eye to making its position more flexible." He added: 
"This topic must be decided by the incoming Brazilian 
Government." 
  Regarding "concrete points," Petrella warned that "the 
interests of local laboratories must be taken into account as 
they have been operating in accordance with a modus vivendi that 
is permitted by the current law. The interests of the consumer 
have also been considered." He ratified his "confidence" that 
the Argentine Congress "will come up with a law that will 
harmonize all interests." 
  Referring to Argentina not being included on the list of 
nations to be sanctioned, Petrella stressed that the U.S. 
Government "made an important political gesture that reveals its 
good relations and rapport" with Argentina. 
  He said: "This is an important topic, but it is not 
extremely 
important," while emphasizing that "these excellent relations 
must not be impaired, especially at this time when they are 
based on strategic viewpoints that are much more difficult to 
achieve." He added: "These are small steps that Argentina can 
take to attenuate the situation." 
  The vice foreign minister stressed that our country "has a 
well-defined position" regarding the conflict over the 
continental glaciers, adding that "the idea of arbitration" has 
reached Chile. "From what I know and from Argentina's 
viewpoint, there have been no feelers regarding this new 
possibility," Petrella said. 
  Finally, regarding the sending of Argentine Border Police to 
the former Yugoslavia, Petrella said: "There are a number of UN 
demands of which Argentines can be very proud, especially the 
Armed Forces."

  [Text] (DYN) -- The balance of trade in the first two 
months this year produced a massive deficit of 1.11 billion 
dollars, an almost ninefold increase over the same period last 
year, the INDEC census bureau reported yesterday. 
  Exports during the period totalled 1.89 billion dollars, a 
4.4 percent increase over the same period last year. Imports 
however grew by 55.2 percent and totalled just over three 
billion dollars. 
  The trade imbalance with the United States shot up by 132.3 
percent while the only surplus of note was achieved in trade 
with the Netherlands (117 million dollars). 
  Although there were small surpluses on trade with individual 
countries, in most cases these didn't exceed 10 million dollars 
as was the case with Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, 
Venezuela, Denmark, Greece, Portugal and China. 
  Trade with the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
southern-cone common market went from a 5.1-million-dollar 
surplus in January-February 1993 to a deficit 152.8 million 
dollars in the same period this year. Trade with NAFTA followed 
the same trend and shot up 135 percent to 638 million dollars. 
  Exports of primary products continued to decline in the 
first 
two months, falling 19.6 percent with respect to the same period 
last year, although exports of value-added agricultural goods 
grew by 7.1 percent and industrial goods by 27.6 percent. 
  Percentage increases in imports by product grouping were 
114.7 for capital goods and 38.6 percent for their spare parts 
and 30.5 percent for consumer goods, almost five times the 
growth rate of the gross domestic product. 
  Capital goods accounted for 40 percent of imports in January 
and 47.4 percent in February while consumer goods accounted for 
18.7 percent of imports in the first month of the year and 15.6 
percent in the second. Imports of semi-processed goods also 
increased by 34.4 percent as did buses, up 37.2 percent and 
fuels up by 178.4 percent. 
  Most of the imported goods, or some 838.2 million dollars 
worth, came from the United States although Argentina's sales 
there were only a quarter of this. The deficit with Brazil, at 
175 million dollars, was up by a whopping 501.4 percent.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 6 May (NA) -- Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo stated on 6 May that the trade deficit "does not 
constitute a problem" because it is caused by the importation of 
capital goods, which produce "more investments." The economy 
minister stressed: "The increase in imports does not constitute 
a problem if it helps to increase our productive capacity." 
  Cavallo conceded that the unemployment number is 
"worrisome," 
while snapping out that "1.5 million new jobs have been created 
over the last four years." He argued: "During October 1989, 
there were 11.5 million people employed. This figure increased 
to 12.5 million in October 1993 while in the last six years it 
had grown by only 600,000." [passage omitted] 
  The minister said one should wonder "why more new jobs are 
not being created." He said many small- and medium-scale 
entrepreneurs "are afraid of the law on accidents on the 
shop-floor and current labor laws." 
  This prompted him to reiterate his request for the enactment 
of the Labor Flexibility Law because "we must have more 
realistic labor laws, at least for the Pymes [small- and 
medium-scale enterprises]." 
  To conclude, Cavallo pointed out that over the last three 
years the country has grown "25 percent," which means Argentina 
"has recorded the third largest growth rate in the world."

  [Excerpt] An IMF delegation which will handle the auditing 
of fiscal accounts will arrive in our country tomorrow with the 
goal of persuading the Argentine Government to substantially 
reduce its levels of spending. 
  The delegation, headed by British economist Martin Hardy, 
will almost entirely concentrate on persuading the economic 
leadership to further reduce its spending in order to achieve an 
increased fiscal surplus. The IMF delegates' goal is clear: 
Argentina must reduce its spending by at least 10 percent of 
the 1994 budget allocations. This is equivalent to about 1.5 
percent of the GDP. 
  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has already said 
unofficially that it is impossible, with the current 
administrative structure, to further reduce spending. 
  The economy minister asked his team of assistants to be 
extremely careful and convince the IMF auditors of the fact that 
a budget cut similar to the one implemented in 1993 is not 
viable now because the entire administrative structure would be 
affected. 
  During a meeting with his closest officials, Cavallo 
expressed a worrisome omen: "If we implement the IMF petitions, 
we run the risk of throwing our entire efforts in the field of 
collection, public sector reform, and state streamlining 
overboard. We cannot reduce spending any further now. They 
cannot expect us to cut back on retiree, Comprehensive Medical 
Assistance Plan, and hospital funds." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The various opposition political parties 
represented in Congress have united to safeguard democracy in 
Bolivian at this difficult moment. This opposition bloc 
comprises the following parties: the Nationalist Democratic 
Action, Condepa [Conscience of the Fatherland], MIR [Movement of 
the Revolutionary Left], ASD [Democratic Socialism Alternative], 
PDC [Christian Democratic Party], Arbol [Bolivian Renewal 
Alternative]; Eje [National Convergency Axis], and PRIN 
[Revolutionary Party of the Nationalist Left]. 
  These political parties believe the government has clearly 
proven it does not know how to hold a dialogue, does not wish to 
reach agreements, and shamelessly imposes its will and commits 
abuses in the exercise of power. [passage omitted] 
  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has voiced satisfaction 
over the creation of an opposition front. Government spokesman 
Ernesto Machicado released the chief of state's message 
regarding the new opposition bloc formed by eight political 
parties represented in Congress. 
  [Begin Machicado recording] The Bolivian people are tired of 
sterile confrontations that lead nowhere and only generate a 
collective sense of frustration and discouragement. 
  For this reason, at a time when social tension is declining 
and the doors for fraternity and understanding are being opened, 
I welcome with great satisfaction the announcement by eight 
opposition political leaders of their willingness to negotiate 
agreements and to discuss and solve the great problems that 
affect us all. I fully agree with them that differences of a 
doctrinal, programmatic, and political nature cannot prevail 
over national interests. [end recording]

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] OPPOSING VIEWS OF ALTERNATIVE 
DEVELOPMENT -- Appraising the apparent success of the 
government's alternative development policy in the coca-growing 
Chapare region, the Regional Alternative Development Project 
(PDAR) reported to La Paz PRESENCIA of 31 March that road 
improvement programs in the Chapare have contributed to 
significant increases in the volume of fruit sales in 1993. For 
example, it was noted that pineapple sales increased 247 
percent, from 195,000 kg in 1992 to 679,000 kg in 1993. The PDAR 
reported that by the end of 1993, 519 km of road had been 
rehabilitated in the Chapare agricultural areas and 200 km of 
road improvement is envisaged for 1994. The fact that these 
roads are now passable year-round facilitates the 
commercialization of a great variety of agricultural products. 
  In the 13 April PRESENCIA, however, Felipe Caceres Garcia, 
executive secretary of the Special Federation of Peasant Workers 
of the Tropics (FETCT), painted a gloomy picture of alternative 
development, noting that the Chapare coca growers, who have been 
compensated $2,000 per hectare of coca bushes destroyed, are 
emigrating to Argentina or Chile with the money. Caceres blamed 
the government for not providing adequate "alternative" 
occupations or investment opportunities in the region and 
asserted that "at least $20 million has left the country." He 
explained that to date 25,000 hectares of coca have been 
voluntarily eliminated which amounts to $50 million in 
compensation. 
  Caceres pointed out in the 3 April Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS 
that even Enrique Ugalde, under secretary for alternative 
development, admitted recently that he is "tired of calling the 
governemt's coca substitution plan `alternative development,' 
and would prefer to call the policy `alternative revenue.'" 
Caceres also noted that the coca growers and peasants of the 
region thoroughly agree with Ugalde's statement and are waiting 
for the government to come up with "real alternative 
development in the Chapare coca-producing area that will create 
an economy that will liberate the producer from a coca 
monoculture." Caceres said that electrification, road 
improvements, and the creation of schools and health centers may 
raise standards of living, but nobody will be there to use them 
if people emigrate in search of jobs. 
  TOURISM REVENUE -- Tourism, which has enjoyed a 10 percent 
annual growth rate since 1987, is a sector of growing importance 
for the economy, generating $192 million in 1993 and comprising 
3.6 percent of the GDP, according to government sources. La Paz 
PRESENCIA of 18 March reported that Ramiro Ortega, acting 
minister of finance and economic development, said the 
government has presented a draft tourism promotion law which 
aims at generating $220 million in revenue, attracting $300 
million in investment, and creating 60,000 jobs by 1997. Ricardo 
Rojas Harrison, national secretary for tourism development, told 
Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS on 30 March that the National Tourism 
Plan will invest $15 million to develop ecotourism. He added 
that Cochabamba would be the springboard for the plan because of 
its great tourist potential. 
  COCHABAMBA AIRPORT -- Construction of the second phase of 
Cochabamba's Jorge Wilsterman Airport will begin in two months 
at a cost of $26 million, reported Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS of 26 
March. Italy will finance $18 million and the rest will be 
disbursed by the National Treasury. The money will go mainly to 
finance the cost of a new terminal. 
  ENTEL INVESTS IN VARIOUS PROJECTS -- German Medrano, 
executive president of the National Telecommunications 
Enterprise (ENTEL), told La Paz EL DIARIO of 7 April that ENTEL 
plans to invest $24 million in 31 projects around the country in 
1994. Among the most important projects is the radio link with 
Chile. ENTEL's goal is to be linked to the Panamerican cable by 
1995, thereby reducing costs and increasing volume. 
  FAO INVESTMENT -- The UN Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) announced in La Paz EL DIARIO of 2 April an investment of 
$3 million during the next four years for the Alta Cuenca del 
Guadalquivir project which aims at promoting sustainable 
development projects, such as reforestation, soil improvement, 
and land management, for peasants in the central valley. The FAO 
technical adviser in Tarija said that FAO Norway would disburse 
$2 million for this purpose and that $1 million would come from 
the Netherlands. 
  CONCERN OVER "CENTRAL AXIS" DOMINATION -- An editorial in La 
Paz PRESENCIA of 2 April commented on "worrisome" data 
concerning the predominance of the country's "central axis" 
which comprises the Departments of the La Paz, Cochabamba, and 
Santa Cruz. Figures provided by the 1992 Population and Housing 
Census revealed that 68.1 percent of Bolivia's population 
resides in those three departments and over half the population 
in each department resides in the respective capital. According 
to the Ministry of Finance, 91.35 percent of the taxes are 
generated in the "central axis" and 75.1 percent of the 
country's economic establishments and 77.9 percent of its 
employed population are located there. Government authorities 
added that 80 percent of the country's revenue is invested in 
the region. 
  The editorial described this "macrocephaly" as being very 
"dangerous," because it is a result of unbalanced growth not 
accompanied by the creation of of basic social services and 
infrastructure to meet the needs of the population. The 
editorial added that the result was depopulation of many regions 
of the country with the usual "geopolitical and social 
consequences." 
  A commentary by Jose Luis Roca in the Cochabamba daily LOS 
TIEMPOS of 3 April contradicted the PRESENCIA editorial, arguing 
that the " central axis" is a "good thing for Bolivia," because 
it has prevented the rise of the single "hegemonic" city typical 
of other Latin American countries. The commentator explained 
that these departments have "achieved an admirable geopolitical 
equilibrium," and are not a threat to each other. He noted that 
each department along the axis represents "one of the three 
important regions of the country: highlands, valleys, and 
plains," and that they "extend their influence to the most 
remote corners of the nation's territory."

  [Text] Brasilia, 6 May (EFE) -- Today, Brazilian President 
Itamar Franco sent congratulatory messages to Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat following 
the recent agreement to establish a Palestine Self-Government 
Authority [Autoridad Palestina de Auto-Gobierno]. 
  The decision to create a provisional Palestine 
Self-Government Authority with jurisdiction on the Palestine 
territories in the Gaza Strip and Jericho is considered 
"historic" by the Brazilian chief of state. 
  Franco points out that the agreement represents a new 
horizon 
for the consolidation of peace, safety, and stability in the 
Middle East that will benefit the region and all of humanity. 
  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, who hosted the 
Rabin-Arafat 
meeting held in Cairo on 4 May, also received a congratulatory 
message from Franco.

<F P=106> [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>
  [Excerpt] On 6 May, PT [Workers Party] presidential 
candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva said that if he is elected, 
his foreign policy would promote a debate on a "new 
international political and economic order" and would seek to 
establish "sound" ties with countries that have large consumer 
markets and that are not aligned with economic blocs. In 
addition to Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries, he 
mentioned South Africa, India, China, and Russia. 
  Lula made it clear that he does not intend to attach 
priority 
to traditional Brazilian partners: "Over the past five 
centuries Brazil has had trade relations with practically Europe 
and the United States alone, which have now closed themselves 
off into large blocs." He said his foreign policy would be 
"active, with as much traveling as possible, to make Brazil 
approach those countries and show the governments of rich 
countries the problems and the development model that Brazil 
wants to implement." 
  Lula spoke shortly before dedicating the headquarters of his 
campaign's central committee on Angelica Avenue, in downtown Sao 
Paulo, on the eve of his departure for the United States. He 
will leave today on a five-day visit during which he will meet 
with U.S. officials, businessmen, and official organizations. 
  Lula also referred to the type of "strong state" that he 
wants to build in Brazil: "It will not be a state that will 
meddle with the economy, but a strong state that will promote a 
good taxation policy and increase revenues and investment to 
resolve the problems of starvation and misery in the country," 
he explained. He added that in his government, "the sectors 
that are not strategic" for national sovereignty might be 
transferred to the private sector, yet he said that instead of 
thinking about the privatization of existing hydroelectric 
plants or highways, entrepreneurs should try to build what 
Brazil still needs to promote its development. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Hernan Cisternas Arellano in Valparaiso] </F>
  [Text] Last night, Chilean President Eduardo Frei 
Ruiz-Tagle announced the government's decision to propose 
initiatives that would enhance Chile's presence on the high seas 
and would give credence to the government's intention to protect 
marine areas falling within the national jurisdiction. Frei 
said the government is aware that the sea is one of the bases 
for national development, and he thus wants to act accordingly 
in that area. 
  He noted that the government will decisively support the 
modernization of the Navy, which plays a key role in 
safeguarding Chilean sovereignty, in effectively patrolling the 
sea, and in protecting Chilean rights on the high seas. 
  Frei said he would continue to develop a comprehensive 
fishing policy, which at this stage should reinforce its 
administrative mechanisms to promote equitable access to these 
resources and make rational use of them. 
  Frei announced publicly that he is committed to creating the 
conditions for and facilities to bring about the adequate 
improvement and development of the ports, which he characterized 
as the backbone of Chile's maritime presence. In this regard, 
he emphasized the decision to incorporate the private sector in 
developing these ports. 
  Frei was the only speaker at last night's opening ceremony 
of 
the Month of the Sea celebration. Thus, he became the first 
chief executive to open this celebration since it was instituted 
20 years ago by Admiral Jose Toribio Merino, retired. 
  Attending the ceremony, which was held at the Playa Ancha 
naval auditorium, were Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma; 
Secretary General of the Presidency Genaro Arriada; Transport 
Minister Narciso Irureta; Chamber Speaker Jorge Schaulsohn; Navy 
Commander Jorge Martinez Busch; General Richard Quass, 
representing the Army; Gen. Jose de la Fuente, representing the 
Air Force; Gen. Fernando Cordero, representing the Carabineros; 
and members of the Navy high command, among other officials. 
  Frei stated that there have been contradictory 
interpretations of the right to fish on the high seas, which 
have led to the abusive depredation of resources and 
environmental degradation. He called for an international 
regulation process to prevent this sort of abuse without 
affecting the fundamental freedom to fish or the high seas laws, 
and without aspiring to an extension of the national maritime 
jurisdiction. 
  Frei pointed out that the Convention on Sea Rights grants 
the 
country having the coastline the sovereign rights to explore, 
exploit, preserve, and administer natural resources within its 
exclusive economic zone. He added, however, that regarding the 
shared fish species, these rights lose their validity because 
the country having the coastline has no ability to preserve and 
administer the said resources found beyond the 200 mile zone. 
  Frei explained that in order to improve the legislation on 
the high seas, which are thought of as an asset for the public 
good, the objectives of Agenda 21 approved at the Rio-92 summit 
must be taken into account. On this basis, Frei pointed out that 
Chile has a five-point proposal which, as its first step, calls 
for international acceptance of the UN Convention on Sea Rights, 
which has been paralyzed as a result of disputes over ocean 
mining. The said proposal considers first of all the negotiation 
of an international convention on the preservation of fish 
species that live in various zones and are highly migratory.

  [Text] Santiago, 6 May (EFE) -- Chilean Socialist Party 
deputies have voiced their concern that the free trade agreement 
Chile intends to negotiate with the United States will 
negatively influence commercial relations with the EU and Asian 
countries. The deputies have asked for a special meeting of the 
Chamber of Deputies to analyze the meaning, purpose, and terms 
of a free trade agreement with the United States. 
  Jose Antonio Viera Gallo, president of the Socialist Party 
bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, told reporters that Chile's 
foreign trade is very diversified, that its main trade partners 
are in Asia and the EU, and that the U.S. share of Chile's 
foreign trade is only 20.5 percent. The socialist deputy 
underscored that Chile's trade with the EU and Asia yields a 
surplus while its trade with the United States generates a 
deficit. 
  Viera Gallo emphasized that an agreement with the United 
States will not greatly benefit Chile and cautioned against "a 
mirage." He added that a free trade agreement will probably 
improve the sales of manufactured products which currently pay 
high customs rates in the United States, but will harm exports 
of raw materials which now pay just 1.8 percent in the United 
States. 
  Viera Gallo pointed out that the United States has already 
raised objections regarding three sensitive areas: price 
brackets for agricultural products, waiting periods for the 
repatriation of capital which the United States wants to be less 
than 1 year, and intellectual property rights because the 
Chilean law on patents is considered inadequate. 
  Socialist Party deputies, who belong to the ruling 
coalition, 
have also indicated that a new agreement must be reached with 
the members of the Common Market of the South: Argentina, 
Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.

  [Text] Minister Secretary General of the Presidency Genaro 
Arriagada has said that even though corruption is not prevalent 
in Chile, "it is the right time to take action if we want our 
institutions and political practices to meet the ethical 
requirements of public service." 
  At the opening session for the academic year of the School 
of 
Political and Managerial Science in the Academy of Christian 
Humanism, Arriagada lectured on "Public Probity and Ethics," 
noting that the country has a deficit in the development of its 
public ethics. "We do not have a sick, but rather a developing 
country, with good intentions but without experience in matters 
like this, vital and dynamic, but fragile," he said. He added 
that "we are not clearly aware of the limits of power, the rules 
and criteria that must be observed by politicians, public 
servants, and citizens in case of conflict of interest. We have 
a legalistic mentality coupled with the idea that violating the 
law is not something serious." He said that many of the cases 
that the press has reported as being instances of corruption "do 
not originate with a deliberate desire to acquire wealth, but 
with the ignorance of elected authorities -- especially those in 
municipal governments -- who believe they can manage power as 
liberally, and as free from any rules as they run their small 
private businesses." 
  He said that the border between power and money is hazy, "to 
the extent that leading entrepreneurs usually boast of the 
political power they have acquired by financing political 
campaigns, while there is a dangerous lack of definition of 
incompatibility." 
  He added that in light of this situation, the government has 
created a high-level commission to focus on the problem from the 
viewpoint of a state policy, beyond partisan confrontation and 
beyond the disputes between the government and the opposition. 
  He said that public servants, because of their being in 
government, have stricter obligations in their public and 
private lives, despite the fact that the country demands high 
levels of morality in all areas of activity. 
  He added that corruption originates not only in the 
weaknesses of human nature, but also in the faults of the 
political, institutional, and administrative systems. 
  Referring to the state's relationship with the economy, 
Arriagada said the greatest risks of corruption are hatched in 
this relationship, as there are private agents seeking 
illegitimate influence in their favor, and also state agents -- 
in what is considered true corruption -- who sometimes also 
receive private benefits. 
  Arriagada said that in order to fight this potential threat, 
it is necessary to combat obscurity in the decisionmaking 
procedures, and where there is ample room for public servants to 
exercise discretional power. He added that the third source of 
corruption is the monopoly public officials have in allocating 
funds. 
  Arriagada also referred to the relationship between money 
and 
politics, stating that this is a problem that is common to 
political parties, movements, and any political system, and 
which if not controlled and clarified greatly harms respect for 
politics as well as the legitimacy of the resources. 
  He said that in order to solve this problem, laws must be 
created to reduce the costs of political campaigns, and in 
addition establishing forms of public, state, or private 
financing. "Any form of financial aid, whether it come from 
private enterprise, international political organizations, the 
abusive use of state resources, or any other imaginable 
resource, must be carefully controlled." 
  Arriagada ended by stating that democracy requires clear, 
powerful efforts and results in this regard. "In many countries 
of the world, upholding the superiority of democracy as a form 
of government is not, in the eyes of the public, currently based 
on the capacity of democrats to establish an open style of 
political and governmental action, with the sole purpose of 
serving the people they represent."

  [Text] "The Colombia Government has replied to the U.S. 
State Department letter in accordance to its duty: to defend the

Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana has made this statement 
as he expressed his support for the Colombian response to the 18 
April U.S. letter questioning Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff's attitude. 
  Pastrana said: "It is worrisome that as policies of

entire country so as to have their sentences reduced for 
allegedly collaborating with authorities." 
  Pastrana also urged the two governments to reestablish the 
lines of communication, to normalize bilateral relations, and to 
reactivate the mechanisms of judicial collaboration to fight 
international drug trafficking. 
  Meanwhile, Pastrana reiterated his opposition to the 
legalization of drugs, saying: "Should Senator Kerry or any 
other U.S. authority have substantial information that will 
contribute to preventing drug trafficking from interfering with 
Colombian politics, he must say so immediately by providing the 
details he knows."

  [Text] Superintendent General Publio Fretes Fernandez, 
retired -- head of the National Narcotics Directorate (Dinar) -- 
has stated that Paraguay urgently needs a law to stop money 
laundering because drug money is being actively laundered in 
Paraguay. He announced that a bill will be submitted to 
Congress soon. "Money is being laundered on a regular basis in 
Paraguay. There is no other explanation for the ease with which 
so many people mysteriously invest money in our country," Fretes 
said. The high-ranking police officer explained that there is 
abundant and obvious evidence that a lot of money from doubtful 
sources openly circulates in Paraguay. 
  He added: "You can see the high-rise buildings, stadiums, 
and 
amphitheaters that have sprouted like mushrooms after rain in 
Asuncion and its suburbs. A lot of money is involved, a lot of 
investments." 
  He explained: "Even though Dinar does not have a law on 
which 
to act, it investigates to the extent possible. It would be 
impossible for those involved to identify any legal source for 
their capital. These are reliable signs that drug money is 
laundered in Paraguay." 
  The chief of Dinar added that since he took over the Police 
Investigative Department, he has noticed the swift and easy 
"circulation" of large amount of cash. "At the airport we 
frequently find people bringing in or taking out $800,000 or 
$900,000. Asked about the source of this money, they merely say 
it was taken it out of a bank. We can do nothing because we 
have no law to back us up. These money amounts are bound to 
draw attention," the police officer explained when talking about 
the clues available to the drug enforcement police. Fretes 
added that his organization, which is under the jurisdiction of 
the National Antinarcotics Secretariat (Senad), is drawing up a 
bill which it will submit to Congress in due time.

  [Text] The Russian Federation and Paraguayan governments 
are taking steps to sign a bilateral or multilateral agreement 
on deep-sea fishing within the framework of an agreement on 
commercial and economic cooperation. It has yet to be decided 
which neighboring country, either Argentina or Brazil, may be 
selected, although the balance is tipped in favor of Argentina. 
Uruguay may also be included. 
  Reliable sources have said the preliminary negotiations 
initiated some months ago have been translated into a rough 
draft of an international agreement based on the UN Convention 
on Maritime Law. 
  It should be recalled that, pursuant to the agreement 
between 
Russia and Paraguay -- the first of its kind -- the parties have 
granted each other the status of most-favored nation while 
promoting economic bilateral cooperation in building, 
streamlining, and reconstructing mixed enterprises between both 
nations or within the Treaty of Asuncion or Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South]. The agreement also provides for the 
facilitation of the supply of equipment, technology transfer, 
and industrial cooperation. 
  All this was confirmed with the visit of Sergey Glazyev 
[name 
as published], Russian minister of foreign economic relations, 
to Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay more than a year 
ago. His proposals have been enhanced by Yan Anastasyevich 
Burlyay, Russian ambassador to Argentina and concurrent 
ambassador to Paraguay. 
  His ideas produced a favorable response among Paraguayan 
ship 
owners, so much so that after discussions with the government at 
technical level, steps were taken to adopt the necessary 
international instruments to begin deep-sea fishing in the 
territorial waters of neighboring countries like Argentina and 
Brazil, and possibly Uruguay. 
  Official negotiations will be pursued within the framework 
of 
Articles 69 and 70 of the UN Convention on Maritime Law, which 
establishes landlocked countries' rights to deep-water fishing. 
Legislation and other background information have been collected 
in the aforementioned neighboring countries to assess whether 
this could be a cost-effective activity for Paraguayan ship 
owners or for joint ventures between Paraguay and other 
countries like Russia. This move also seeks to define the 
species of fish to be captured, and the marketing in Paraguay or 
other countries.

  [Text] The Peruvian Communist Party [PCP], during the 
plenary session of its Central Committee, decided to support the 
possible presidential candidacy of Javier Perez de Cuellar, in 
an effort to unify the democratic, political, and social forces 
of the country based on a consensus program. 
  The possible candidacy of Perez de Cuellar was supported 
because it could open the path for the installation in the 
country of a democratic regime capable of ending dictatorship 
and effectively fighting poverty and unemployment. 
  The PCP, headed by Jorge del Prado and Secretary General 
Renan Raffo Munoz, said the current administration is trying to 
remain in government to continue a neoliberal policy that has 
eliminated social and economic rights, worsened the crisis, and 
run rampant over democratic institutions. 
  The 10th PCP Plenary Session also decided to hold the 
Ideological, Programmatic, and Organizational National 
Conference from 26 to 28 August in Ica. 
  The political programmatic guidelines to be debated include 
the "reestablishment of democratic institutions with the full 
enforcement of civil, political, and social freedom." It will 
also debate the democratization of the state, the main role of 
which should be the promotion and management of overall 
development through coordinated planning and the market; and the 
implementation of municipal and regional decentralization and 
autonomy.

  [Text] Huancayo -- The dangerous Chilean terrorist 
"Rodrigo," who heads the so-called MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] Central Guerrilla Front (Junin, Pasco, 
and Huancavelica), may be in hiding in the central jungle area, 
according to Villa Perene authorities. 
  The dangerous terrorist is allegedly planning some terrorist 
actions to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the clash with 
security forces in Los Molinos, on 28 April 1989. 
  The spokesman added that a few days ago the Chilean 
participated in several attacks perpetrated in Pampa, Tigre, and 
Alto Celendin, in the central jungle in Chanchamayo. 
  The source added that in the meantime, a group of MRTA 
members is steadily moving toward the higher areas of southern 
Chanchamayo Province. 
  According to a source in the National Crime Investigative 
Directorate (Dinincri), the Chilean "Rodrigo" arrived in Peru in 
1990 to learn and later on participate in MRTA criminal 
activities. 
  Once in Peru, the MRTA made him witness some attacks, such 
as 
the one perpetrated against the La Rosa Nautica restaurant in 
1991. 
  Later on, following the orders of the third most powerful 
MRTA leader, Chilean terrorist Jaime Castillo Petrucci, aka 
Alfredo, Rodrigo started to take part in actions, because the 
MRTA knew that he had already participated in several acts of 
sabotage in Chile. 
  After participating in several actions, Rodrigo was made a 
member of the MRTA Abduction and Extortion Special Force headed 
by Petrucci and other Chilean terrorists. Rodrigo thus 
participated in the murder of businessman David Ballon Vera and 
Spanish citizen Carlos Manrique Acevedo, as well as the 
abduction of businessmen Hiraoka and Furokawa.

  [Text] Beside the serious problem created by the poppy 
cultivations found in various regions of Amazonas Department, 
thousands of hectares of illegal coca are being grown in other 
regions of this department, specifically in Utcubamba and 
Condorcanqui Provinces. 
  According to spokesmen of the Army 5th Jungle Infantry 
Division, which is headquartered in El Milagro, it is estimated 
that in those two provinces about 10,000 hectares of coca is 
being grown, much of it in full growth, while some has already 
been harvested. 
  "The case is worrisome. If no measures are taken, 
Condorcanqui and Utcubamba may become the new bastions of 
trafficking," said a high-ranking military officer. He revealed 
that one month ago a group of U.S. Embassy and DEA officials 
came to El Milagro base to verify this information. 
  He added: "They gathered information, offered aid, but so 
far 
nothing happened." 
  Coca is being grown in the mountains in zones which, by 
contrast with the Huallaga region, cannot be seen from a 
helicopter; they can only be reached by walking. 
  In Condorcanqui Province, the coca fields begin in El Muyo 
settlement (about four hours by car from Bagua Chica) and 
continue through Tutuberos, Montenegro, Soldado Oliva, 
Shunshunga, Nazareno, Yusabarranca, San Rafael, Mesones Muro, 
and Imazita. 
  All the settlements are alongside the Transversal de la 
Selva 
highway that parallels the Maranon River. 
  At the other extreme, in Utcubamba Province, the coca fields 
begin in Tiricon and continue through La Union, Tupac Amaru, El 
Paraiso, Yusubarranca, El Tambo, and end in Santa Maria de Nieva. 
  The 5th Jungle Infantry Division, which is headquartered in 
El Milagro, is trying to control trafficking in this zone even 
though their exclusive task is to watch over the border zone in 
the Condor mountain range. 
  Their sporadic operations are sometimes wasted, as verified 
by our reporters when, with a military patrol, they entered the 
jungle in Mirana Alta. 
  There, the soldiers discovered that the six coca maceration 
pits they destroyed one month ago were operating again. Even 
worse, they found coca already processed. 
  The work of the Interior Ministry and the police is 
practically null. Their personnel only go after people wanted 
for interrogation, or they investigate trafficking cases when 
the Army gets the means and the personnel, and invites them to 
go into the jungle. 
  And when they go, their work is unbelievable. There in the 
mountains they are exposed to the sun and the torrential rains. 
  Alamiro Bustamante, provincial assistant prosecutor of 
Bagua, 
said: "They should hear in Lima how they have to work. 
Truthfully, there is little we can do."

  [Text] For the first time, a person charged with terrorist 
activities has been interviewed by Radio Programas del Peru in 
his cell in Cachiche Prison, in Ica. 
  Gregorio Uribe Guillen, who is serving his sentence in 
Cachiche Prison, said that the peace accord proposed by Abimael 
Guzman is not a strategy for Shining Path [SL] reorganization. 
Let us hear what he said: 
  [Begin recording] [Uribe] I wish to voice my resolute 
support 
for President Gonzalo's letters asking President Alberto 
Fujimori for negotiations to reach a peace accord. The fact 
that there are still acts of violence shows that the actions 
have still not stopped, and I think this would be the best thing 
for all concerned. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is this to give you time to 
reorganize and resume your struggle against the state of law in 
a few years' time? 
  [Uribe] No. We are quite aware that this is not a strategy, 
but rather something that is necessary for the Peruvian people, 
for Peruvian society as a whole, to reach peace. It is not a 
matter of strategy but something that is necessary. [end

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Angel Paez] </F>
  [Text] The Shining Path Central Committee, comprised of 
leaders who have still not been arrested and alternate members 
elected by the Shining Path congress in 1988, held a meeting in 
February that was presided over by Oscar Ramirez Durand, a.k.a. 
"Comrade Feliciano." During the meeting, the Shining Path 
Central Committee decided to continue the "people's war" and to 
consider those members who uphold the peace accord with the 
government to be removed from the party "by their own free will." 
  The document entitled "To Grow Strong on the Grounds of 
Partisan Unity and Conquer Power" [Reafirmarse en la Base de 
Unidad Partidaria y Construir la Conquesta del Power], which 
contains the conclusions of the Shining Path event, criticizes 
the leaders under arrest who try to convince the militants still 
operating to "uphold the great decision and definition," that 
is, Abimael Guzman's appeal for the Shining Path to end 
hostilities against the Peruvian state. 
  A Shining Path pamphlet dated February, which is signed by 
the leaders under arrest, asserts that "the people's war has 
ended, and (therefore) to continue refusing to uphold (the 
"great decision and definition") means obstructing the Peace 
Accord and placing the life of President Gonzalo and other 
comrades at stake." 
  But the Central Committee meeting in February disqualified 
the arrested leaders, stating that "it is an international 
communist rule that no leader can lead (the party or a war) from 
prison." According to the Maoist theory, a militant who is in 
prison loses his operational capacity when he is isolated from 
reality, and therefore is assigned another type of job. 
  In March, the National Counterterrorism Directorate 
[Dincote] 
learned about the Shining Path meeting, according to an 
intelligence report datelined 31 March that states it was held 
in Razuhuillca, Huanta Province, Ayacucho. As a result, 
Peruvian Air Force troops carried out operations in the 
aforementioned area during the second week of April. The 
operations, however, were unproductive. 
  Dincote also obtained information according to which 
"Feliciano" presided over the meeting, during which it was 
decided to start a new phase of the "people's war" as well as 
plan an operation to rescue Abimael Guzman, dead or alive, at 
any cost. 
  The five-point document issued at the end of the meeting is 
attached to lengthy citations of speeches by Abimael Guzman and 
documents signed by him that show why the war must not end. 
  The following is one of the citations chosen by the Shining 
Path Central Committee to uphold its decisions: "Always taking 
into account the glorious actions of the people's war, the 
people's war cannot end. The leadership may be wiped out 
completely or partially, but those leaders who are not must and 
can continue carrying out plans, the struggle, the people's war. 
We were taught that the revolution will not stop, will not 
become paralyzed." This was selected from the document entitled 
"To Conquer Power in the Midst of the People's War" that was 
drafted during the Second Shining Path Central Committee Plenum, 
when Guzman was still free. 
  The document even mentions what must be done with those who 
uphold peace and put down arms: "There are two reasons for 
surrendering: to surrender in view of local reaction and to 
surrender in view of international reaction. This is always the 
case. Its purpose is to ruin the revolution. Those who 
surrender, therefore, are no good, and must be wiped out through 
fire and bloodshed." (Preliminary Session of the Second Plenum). 
  The first of the five points discussed during the meeting 
refers to "reasserting" the agreements reached during the Third 
Central Committee Plenum, which was held in March 1992 and 
headed by Abimael Guzman Reinoso. This plenum was labeled 
"glorious, historic, and momentous" as it planned the terrible 
wave of violence unleashed by the Shining Path in July 1992. 
  During the 1992 partisan meeting, it was stated that during 
an adverse situation the party should draft "a new plan, taking 
into account the experience of the past years, establish new 
axes, sub-axes, guidelines, and lines of action with a 
nationwide criteria (...), seek new ways to develop and set up 
strategic military plans, and establish, for example, those 
objectives and carry them out on an established date." 
  It seems that the Third Central Committee Plenum's 
assessment 
of what was happening to the Shining Path was negative and, 
therefore, it was decided to unleash a fierce wave of violence 
in order to conceal the weaknesses of the Maoist organization. 
  The second point of the document of the Central Committee 
meeting presided over by "Feliciano" highlights the agreements 
of the Working Meeting of the Shining Path leadership held in 
August 1993, almost one year after Guzman was arrested, and 
during which the implementation of the agreements of the Third 
Plenum held in March 1992 was discussed. 
  During the working meeting, and in addition to approving the 
efforts to "step up investigations to determine the sanctions 
for those who are found responsible" for contributing to the 
arrest of Abimael Guzman, it was agreed, among other issues: 
  1. To defend the life of "President Gonzalo" by widely 
preaching our ideology, by showing great courage, placing even 
our lives at stake, by keeping our red and invincible flag 
flying high, and by pursuing our unwavering objective: 
communism." 
  2. To reassert the conclusions of the Third Central 
Committee Plenum (March 1992), "personally presided over by 
President Gonzalo, whose victorious appearance revealed its 
glorious, historic, and momentous nature; the second most 
important milestone after the congress (held in 1988)." 
  3. To reassert the three strategies: the political 
strategy: to conquer power; the military strategy: the people's 
war, to develop the war of movements and promote arrangements 
for the uprising of cities; and the construction strategy: to 
make arrangements to conquer power in the midst of the people's 
war. 
  Based on the conclusions of the Third Plenum and the Working 
Meeting, the Central Committee, during the meeting in February 
presided over by "Feliciano," reasserted "the principle of 
revolutionary violence as a universal law expressed in the 
people's war." 
  The third point discussed during the Central Committee 
meeting headed by "Feliciano" referred to the militants who 
uphold the peace accord. The document addresses this aspect of 
the internal debate as: "About the Struggle Against the 
Counterrevolutionary Hoax and the Black Group that upholds a 
Right-Wing Opportunist Line (LOD)." 
  In order to confront the Black Group or LOD, which are 
nothing but Shining Path militants who sign Abimael Guzman's 
letters and uphold his "great decision and definition" to 
negotiate with the government in order to end the war, the 
Central Committee demands that the militants "grow stronger on 
the Basis for Partisan Unity [Base de Unidad Partidaria, BUP]," 
which is the Shining Path basic principles adopted during the 
1988 Congress, and "arrange for conquering power in the midst of 
the people's war." 
  The Central Committee Plenum that "Feliciano" presided over 
in order to break away from the Black Group orders the 
"unleashing of a massive reassertion movement based on the BUP 
throughout the party, the People's Liberation Army, and among 
the masses of the New Power." 
  The Central Committee uses several arguments to "urge the 
smashing of the counterrevolutionary nonsense and the 
misbegotten schemes of Yankee imperialism, the genocidal and 
traitorous dictatorship, and the Black Group:" 
  1. The agreements reached at the Third Plenum (March 1992) 
and the working meeting (August 1993) must be ratified because 
"facts have confirmed that the position established on those 
occasions toward the counterrevolutionary scheme was right and 
proper." 
  2. Abimael Guzman's letters to President Alberto Fujimori, 
the telephone conversation between Guzman and Javier Esparza 
Marquez (Guzman's brother-in-law, who is in charge of Shining 
Path's organization abroad), and the communiques released by 
Shining Path prisoners "are a counterrevolutionary scheme 
concocted by Yankee imperialists and the genocidal and 
traitorous dictatorship with the sinister help of the Black 
Group," the Central Committee concluded at its February meeting. 
It added: "The short-term objective of this scheme is to win 
the elections, prevent the commemoration of (Mao's) centennial 
in December 1994, and cover up the La Cantuta affair, but the 
final goal is to annihilate the people's war and move ahead with 
their plan to murder President Gonzalo." 
  The Central Committee does acknowledge Guzman as its leader, 
and gives him credit for the ideology he devised, the so-called 
"Gonzalo's Thoughts," but now he is considered to be a merely 
decorative figure because neither the party nor the war can be 
led from a cell, especially when the leader is kept 
incommunicado and his contacts with the outside world must go 
through government officials. 
  3. The Black Group is made up of "infiltrators, traitors, 
weaklings, and old revisionists, linked directly to 
reactionaries," meaning Osman Morote, Elena Iparraguire, Maria 
Pantoja, Martha Huatay, Edmundo Cox, and others who are in touch 
with government representatives and prison officials. 
  4. The activities of the Black Group "go against the 
conclusions of the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist-Gonzalo's Thoughts 
First Congress (1988), the BUP, the leadership, the party, and 
the people's war, which means that its members have voluntarily 
strayed from the party." 
  This clearly means that the negotiators of the peace 
agreement no longer belong to the Shining Path because their 
actions openly violate the agreements, resolutions, and 
decisions reached at party meetings such as the Third Plenum and 
the Working Meeting. Thus, they do not represent the ideology 
of the Peruvian Communist Party-Shining Path. Furthermore: 
  5. "Actions that go against principles cannot be accepted" 
because "it is an international communist rule that the 
leadership (of the party and the war) cannot be exercised from 
prison," and because "monstrosities like the `peace accord'(...) 
clash with our principles." 
  The Central Committee meeting that "Feliciano" presided over 
clearly defined its position toward Abimael Guzman Reinoso, 
whose ideological contribution to the people's war, called 
"Gonzalo's Thoughts," was acknowledged. Gonzalo's "leadership" 
was also accepted but, as he is operationally restricted, he 
cannot lead the party anymore. 
  Guzman and the leaders who support his decision to hold 
talks 
with the administration signed a communique that was released in 
March. This communique "warned against" and "denounced" the 
reports of "Feliciano's" Central Committee, which decided to go 
on with the war. 
  This communique stated: "They are trying to separate 
`Gonzalo's Thoughts' from `President Gonzalo' the person. Under 
the guise of defending the party, they are undermining it and 
its leadership so as to bring about its defeat, by using empty 
rhetoric to disguise their partisan, opportunistic, and personal 
interests and ambitions, and by taking a blind, biased, 
subjective, and superficial approach to concrete reality. (...) 
We urge the eradication of these leftist ideas of military 
extraction." 
  The communique emphasized the decision to put an end to the 
people's war: "The people's war is over. To continue it means 
sabotaging the peace agreement. We warn our members against 
militaristic and revisionist approaches, and urge them to keep 
their eyes open to unmask this or any other scheme." 
  Guzman's call upon the militants in action to "abide" by 
the decision to hold talks with the administration in order to 
stop the war, and to fight those who disagree with this 
decision, is persistent: "Once again we warn the militants to 
be on guard against any desperate action, adventure, or 
provocation from third parties, because the goal of all this is 
to scuttle the proposed peace agreement. Such actions must be 
prevented to the extent possible, and immediately and 
categorically criticized." 
  Meanwhile, the Central Committee has acknowledged "Gonzalo's 
Thoughts" as the ideological basis for the "people's war," 
Guzman Reinoso's "leadership" and his inability to lead the 
party and the war from prison, and has decided to reorganize the 
Shining Path machine to launch a new stage of the war without 
Guzman. 
  The Dincote report lists the steps that "Feliciano's" 
followers are taking to carry out actions that would put Shining 
Path back in the political picture. The report states that the 
Shining Path is expected "to carry out isolated actions at key 
targets in order to demonstrate its operational capacity." 
  Intelligence agents believe that the most likely targets are 
"financial companies, banks, stores, and industries, in order to 
sow confusion among local and foreign investors." 
  Other likely targets are "soon-to-be-privatized public 
energy 
and mining companies, the embassies of countries whose citizens 
are purchasing Peruvian companies, and the interests that these 
countries already have in Peru. Government politicians and 
high-ranking members of the forces of order are also among the 
main targets. In this case the objective is to obtain the 
freedom of Abimael Guzman Reinoso." 
  The counterterrorism police believe that the Shining Path 
"urgently needs to demonstrate its power in order to get out of 
its current defensive position." Dincote's intelligence reports 
adds that the internal strife in the Shining Path has reached 
the level of killings among militants, so it is likely that 
there will be a "settling of accounts." Shining Path members 
believe that surrender deserves capital punishment. 
  The Dincote report, which confirmed that "Feliciano" 
presided 
over a Shining Path Central Committee meeting somewhere in 
Razuillca, added that it has been decided to "rescue Abimael 
Guzman Reinoso, dead or alive." The report explains that 
"Israeli experts in hostage rescue and underwater operations 
(demolition) have been hired for this purpose." 
  The Shining Path also considered the possibility of winning 
over Peruvian security forces personnel "so as to attract new 
members, including Armed Forces Special Operations personnel." 
  The 21-page police report labeled Dincote-EM-2-Lima provides 
a detailed analysis of the behavior of the Shining Path and the 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement throughout the country. 
  According to "Feliciano" and his followers, Guzman Reinoso 
has fallen prey to a plot designed to murder him. "Feliciano" 
claims that the "forged letters" sent to President Alberto 
Fujimori, the communiques supporting the peace agreement signed 
by Shining Path prisoners in Canto Grande, Chorrillos, and 
Yanamayo, and the statements and gestures of Osman Morote 
Bariionuevo and Edmundo Cox Beuzeville are all part of this 
plot. As far as "Feliciano" is concerned, rescuing Guzman 
Reinoso, dead or alive, is just a symbolic gesture in any case.

  [Text] Lima, 6 May (EFE) -- State hospital services 
returned to normal today following the 72-hour national strike. 
The 55,000 mobilized health workers, however, threatened to 
stage an indefinite strike if their salary demands are not met. 
  The health minister said that only 30 percent of all health 
workers participated in the strike. Workers' leaders, however, 
claimed that the percentage of participating strikers was 
larger. Services at hospital outpatient clinics dropped 
substantially during the three-day strike. 
  Workers rejected the recent salary increase granted by the 
government, characterizing it as "miserable." Health Minister 
Jaime Freundt-Thurne said the state does not have any money for 
new salary increases. 
  Health workers earn an average salary of less than $150 per 
month. They criticized the minister for refusing to negotiate 
with their union, and threatened to stage an indefinite strike.

  [Excerpt] After a meeting with President Luis Alberto 
Lacalle at the Libertad building, Senator Walter Santoro 
yesterday morning resigned as president of the executive board 
of the Herreraist faction. Lacalle demanded a political 
definition from Santoro, who said he supports the presidential 
candidacy of Dr. Alberto Volonte. 
  Santoro spoke to CX-8 Radio Sarandi shortly after the 
meeting. He said he had been summoned by the president who, in 
his capacity as leader of the Herreraist sector, wanted to know 
Santoro's choice among the presidential candidates. The 
president mentioned the two alternatives (Juan Andres Ramirez or 
Alberto Volonte). 
  Santoro said he informed Lacalle that his choice was 
Volonte. 
  The Canelones Herreraist leader was then asked if this 
involves "a departure." He replied that he always considered 
Lacalle the true leader of the Herreraist faction, and that for 
this reason he also resigned the presidency of the Herreraist 
executive board. 
  As for his political future, Santoro said he has for a long 
time been in touch with Volonte, adding: "I practically created 
his political position: I discovered him, I urged him, and now I 
have the satisfaction of seeing the level to which he has risen." 
  He said: "I have no problem in supporting his candidacy." 
  As to the chances that the candidacy of Volonte might have 
outside the Herreraist sector, he said the answer will come with 
time. "We have so far maintained our party activities and our 
work for presidential candidates within the Herreraist faction, 
and we have never conversed with anyone outside this faction," 
he added. 
  "We have always tried to resolve the issue within the 
Herreraist faction, to which we have always belonged and in 
which we remain, because we believe that Herreraism goes beyond 
merely electoral matters or personal positions," Santoro 
explained. 
  He concluded: "We maintain that Volonte is a Herreraist 
candidate and that we remain Herreraist faction members."

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with Lieutenant General </F>
Daniel Garcia, Army commander in chief, by unidentified LA 
MANANA reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] 
<H5>  The Armed Forces as Guarantee and Support </H5>
for the People 
  We find ourselves in a presidential year, said Lt. Gen. 
Daniel Garcia, and as such the national Army is concerned with 
providing for the country the guarantees and institutional 
tranquility that will truly support the normal development of 
the elections that are to take place in a few months. 
  This is a cause for concern for us, he noted, because we 
want 
to make it clear that the Army's support is a guarantee that the 
elections will take place in total and absolute calm. He stated 
that in this way the handing over of power will take place 
without mishaps. 
<H5>  Chain of Command Reestablished </H5>
  Lt. Gen. Garcia imposed a new kind of clarity in the 
handling 
of the institution from the very first moment he took control. 
He redefined the officers' internal relations due to their 
tendency to deliberate. Garcia said that perhaps that attitude 
still existed because some "nostalgic officers continued to 
think as they did during the past military process." 
  In an exclusive interview with LA MANANA, Garcia discussed 
various social and political topics and the country's foreign 
relations. 
<H5>  Absolute Calm in the Armed Forces </H5>
  The economic situation affecting the country, as well as an 
Armed Forces internal reorganization imposed by the executive 
branch, has affected all the components in one way or another. 
The general said that there is absolute calm regarding this 
rather acute situation. 
  Regarding the common characterization of the Armed Forces as 
"a family," Garcia said that the definition was an 
oversimplification, and had be analyzed from two different 
levels. 
  The definition of a military family is too all-encompassing, 
and people might think it includes the "retired" personnel. The 
issue is much more complex and serious if we include them in the 
definition. The Army commander in chief is responsible 
exclusively for those "on duty," Garcia said. 
  "We certainly have economic needs, just as any other group 
in 
the country, but we are optimists. We think the situation of 
the country will improve, Army needs will be met, and our 
situation compared to the rest of society will improve," Garcia 
said. 
<H5>  Armed Forces Reorganization </H5>
  Regarding what has been called the new Army structure, 
Garcia 
said: I personally think the term is too explosive. People 
might think the reorganization implies a total destruction of 
present structures in order to create new ones." [no beginning 
quotation marks as published] 
  "I say our work is to adapt, `update' [preceding word in 
Italian] present Army structures to adapt it to new conditions. 
We must try to make it more functional and efficient. We must 
make it more responsive to the new cultural, technological, 
scientific, political, and social development of the world, the 
region, and the country. This has prompted us to propose and 
implement a series of gradual changes day after day. We have 
tried to reach conclusions on the elements we must change in 
order to make the institution more efficient at a time of 
responding to the demands of the new times in which we are 
living." 
<H5>  Armed Forces Position Same as Government's </H5>
  The Army in particular, as well as the other two armed 
branches, have participated in regional and world conferences to 
analyze changes in the new world political geography. Some of 
these changes reflect the intentions of some of the large world 
powers to participate in combined operations to repress drugs 
and terrorism. Some of these changes also imply dropping the 
"traditional Army" concept, which in Latin America stems from 
colonial times. 
  Garcia was very clear about this problem. He said that the 
issue of collective forces, even within Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South], has been discussed in international forums. 
  "Our country's policy has been very clearly established by 
the president," Garcia noted. [passage omitted] 
  "We have maintained the traditional Uruguayan position of 
not 
participating in or encouraging the creation of inter-American 
forces. That is a national foreign policy position. We think 
this is not really what all countries want at this time, 
particularly because of our regional resources' degree of 
development," Garcia said. 
<H5>  Fight Against Drugs and Terrorism </H5>
  We think police forces should be responsible for fighting 
drugs and terrorism. This is in accordance with our countries' 
internal order. We believe that to commit the Armed Forces as 
institutions to fighting these kinds of activities, before the 
bodies specifically created by the states for these functions 
are overwhelmed, is hasty and inappropriate for the development 
of the specific responsibilities that have been assigned to the 
armies. We maintain, however, a careful watch on those types of 
activities, in the sense that we continue to study the 
information available on those areas, and continue to plan for 
possible Army participation in the task, in the given case that 
the national government decides that we should intervene. 
<H5>  Increased Armed Forces Participation in UN Peace Missions </H5>
  Regarding our Armed Forces's future participation in 
UN-sponsored peacekeeping missions and the Armed Forces 
institutional responsibility to ensure the continuation of 
scientific research in the Antarctic, Gen. Garcia said our 
institutional participation is increasingly active and direct. 
  "These Armed Forces activities are part of our country's 
foreign policy. This small country is very dependent on world 
peace and order to guarantee its own peace. We think that our 
contribution to the United Nations for maintaining peace in 
other areas of the world contributes to preserving our internal 
order, and benefits us in our desire to prosper in peace," 
Garcia said. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Armed Forces Will Respect Election Results </H5>
  Regarding the possibility of unexpected electoral results, 
Gen. Garcia clearly erased any doubts with respect to the Armed 
Forces' position: He categorically ruled out any position 
different from that which is established in the Constitution and 
the law. 
  "At present I do not see any reason to think that the Army 
will do anything else but strictly abide by the Constitution and 
the law," Garcia stressed. 
  In accordance with this strong affirmation, Garcia said that 
the Armed Forces, and particularly the Army, is absolutely calm, 
even though the present economic situation affects all social 
groups and the Armed Forces must be completely dedicated and 
cannot maintain other sources of income. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "180 Minutes of News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez has said some 
of the additional resources the state is receiving in bolivares 
from the oversupply of dollars could be earmarked for servicing 
the foreign debt. Lucy Faustino filed this report from 
Miraflores Palace: 
  [Begin recording] [Faustino] After confirming no changes to 
the 1994 budget are expected as a result of the new value of the 
dollar, Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez explained that the 
inorganic money [dinero inorganico] generated by the devaluation 
of our currency will contribute precisely to pay part of the 
budget because, he recalled, the debt service has been 
calculated in dollars. 
  Upon returning from his visit to the United States, the 
finance minister indicated the mechanism for auctioning dollars 
is convenient, adding that it must not be mistaken for imposing 
exchange controls. 
  [Sosa] The very word auction means there are no controls. I 
understand that auction means one person says two, I say three, 
another person says three and one-half. To me that's not 
control. Imposing controls would be for me to fix the exchange 
rate at, say, two, and that would be that. 
  [Faustino] Julio Sosa Rodriguez also indicated that this 
mechanism for auctioning dollars, which replaces the 
mini-devaluations, will be permanent as long as the Central Bank 
of Venezuela deems it appropriate. 
  Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez announced that the 
Central Bank's decision to auction dollars could remain in force 
for at least one year. Sosa Rodriguez reiterated that no 
exchange controls have been proposed because such economic 
measures are not part of the government's economic plan. 
  The finance minister termed as unfounded fears the rumors 
that a black market for foreign exchange would emerge because of 
the decision to auction dollars. Sosa explained that all 
national sector must have confidence in the financial system. 
The finance minister also asserted that it is absolutely false 
that the government is studying a plan to levy a tax on the sale 
of foreign currency. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Milagros Duran] </F>
  [Text] Deputy Julio Montoya (MAS) [Movement Toward 
Socialism], vice president of the Drug Committee, said Congress 
must reach a consensus on the drug trafficking and money 
laundering problem, because Venezuela cannot continue to sit 
back and do nothing while the drug cartels carry out their 
assaults both abroad and at home. 
  Montoya warned yesterday of plans by the agents of drug 
traffickers to free members of the Grecian-Latin Connection 
whose cases are being handled by a judge in Sucre State. 
  Montoya also spoke about drug trafficking operations in 
various parts of the world such as Operation Polar, which is 
related to drug trafficking, and Operation Rainbow, which is 
related to money laundering. 
  He said that according to a Disip [Directorate of 
Intelligence and Prevention Services] report, more than 300 tons 
of cocaine will leave the country's ports and airports in the 
coming days; thus our authorities must be on alert. 
  Deputies Julio Montoya and Julio Elias Mayaudon (National 
Convergence) announced their support for Judge Mildred Camero 
[not further identified]. 
  Montoya also commented on a ruling by Luis Contreras Pernia, 
judge of the Third Superior Court of Tachira, to release certain 
people allegedly linked to drug trafficking. 
  "This is a narco-loving judge. According to information 
available to us, he has a history of ruling in favor of drug 
traffickers." 
  Legislators will vote today on the proposals made by various 
political blocs during this week's debates in the Chamber of 
Deputies on drug trafficking and money laundering. 
  The numerous proposals range from the most controversial 
one, 
presented by Deputy Lindolfo Contreras, to legalize drugs in 
Venezuela to others presented by Deputy Luis Emilio Rondon, 
president of the Committee against Improper Drug Use, which 
include the creation of a narcotics police force and a permanent 
chair on basic, intermediate, and diversified education with 
emphasis on the struggle against this scourge and on preventive 
measures. 
  During the debates, most legislators referred to the case of 
Tachira Judge Luis Contreras Pernia as a "blow dealt by drug 
traffickers" to which the authorities and the entire country 
must respond. 
  Another much debated issue is drug legalization, which has 
its supporters and opponents. Most legislators think that other 
actions to stop drug trafficking in general must be considered 
before drug consumption is legalized in Venezuela.

  [Text] Caracas, 4 May (EFE) -- Commenting on a court 
decision acquitting 32 presumed drug traffickers, Judge Mildred 
Camero denounced on 4 May that drug trafficking has infiltrated 
all levels of the Venezuelan judicial branch. 
  Camero, judge of the Second Trial Court, said the judicial 
branch has lost credibility in Venezuela. 
  "Drug trafficking is everywhere and is increasingly 
corrupting those institutions that were once untouchable. We 
must adopt a firm position on the drug problem," she said. 
  Camero said there is money laundering and the legalization 
of 
drug-related capital in Venezuela. She added there seems to be 
a heavy flow of money into the country, but a high rate of 
poverty prevails, because a false economy is what really exists. 
  Camero had issued arrest warrants against 32 presumed drug 
traffickers, including Rafael Alcantara, president of the 
exchange house "Cavelba," who spent four and one-half months in 
prison for alleged money laundering. Alcantara was acquitted 
yesterday by Judge Luis Contreras Ramirez of the Second Trial 
Court. 
  Alcantara said he will sue Camero for abuse of authority and 
the huge losses he incurred when he had to close his business.

  [Text] Yesterday, when swearing in the Presidential 
Commission for Industrial Policy, President Rafael Caldera said 
the creation of this panel is evidence of the executive branch's 
awareness that it is urgent to plan and implement an 
industrialization policy capable of meeting the new challenges 
of the world's economy. 
  Luis Eduardo Paul Bello, Simon Nobile Olivo, Lino Clemente, 
Eduardo Gomez Sigala, Pedro Carmona Estanga, Phillip Erard, and 
Lopez Mendoza are the members appointed by the Presidency of the 
Republic. The other members are Agriculture Minister Ciro 
Fonseca Anez; Labor Minister Juan Nepomuceno Garrido Mendoza; 
Alberto Poletto of the Foreign Trade Institute; Abdon Vivas 
Teran of the Investments Fund; Policarpo Rodriguez, vice 
president of Finexpo [expansion unknown]; Ignacio Avalos 
Gutierrez, president of Conicit [expansion unknown]; Francisco 
Layrisse, of the Venezuelan Guayana Corporation; Luis Giusti, 
president of Venezuelan Petroleum; Angel Gutierrez, president of 
the Federation of Industries; Jorge Redmond of the Venezuelan 
Council of Industry; Berend Roosen of the National Council of 
Commerce and Services; and Hans Neumann. 
  President Caldera said: The opening of trade, as well as the 
nation's commitments to international organizations, conditions 
established by the Andean Pact, and other circumstances, 
constitute a challenge Venezuela must overcome with basis on 
competitiveness and ability. 
  With the creation of this commission we want to make evident 
the commitment the government has made to the country with 
regard to the future of the Venezuelan economy and also to open 
roads for intense and effective cooperation between the public 
and private sectors. We have invited representatives from the 
private sector to share with us this great responsibility. Its 
representation in this commission will be a permanent driving 
force and provide encouragement so that the goals that have led 
us to the creation of this important commission may be 
satisfactorily reached. 
  At this time I would like to express my special thanks to 
the 
representatives of the private sector who have accepted this 
task. This is a commitment with Venezuela, and the government 
understands it as such. Therefore, it feels obliged to publicly 
express its recognition of those who have decided to take part 
in the efforts we have undertaken to benefit our people. 
  After addressing several issues that had previously been 
discussed on numerous occasions during the government's first 
three months in office, Minister Ciro Anez Fonseca listed 
several basic points of his agricultural policy: 

  -  Legal 
security in all of its forms regarding the agricultural 
sector; 
  -  Heightened production and productivity; 
  -  Incentives for 
farmers, livestock breeders, fishing, and lumber workers, using 
all resources available to the ministry; 
  -  Guarantees that the 
local market will be reserved for local production only, while 
respecting agreements such as GATT, the Andean Pact, and other 
entities with whom we have signed similar multilateral 
agreements; 
  -  Radical changes in domestic agricultural marketing 
policies to bring producers and consumers closer for their 
mutual benefit; 
  -  Broad support for agricultural exports; 
  -  Defining 
priority agricultural items and crop zoning strategies directed 
at diversification and increased productivity; 
  -  And the inclusion 
of new technology, such as biotechnology, minimal labor 
techniques, and organic farming. 
  A compulsory agricultural insurance system will be 
established. Education and training programs will be mainly 
based on new productive structures. The transfer and 
application of technology, particularly crop extension methods, 
will be based on scientific and practical results provided by 
Fonalap [expansion unknown]. Fonalap will also be the subject of 
a complete revision. 
  Some small-scale farmers are complaining about the 
agreements reached with the banks. I want to point out 
something, however, with regard to the small producers who 
receive special treatment from the Institute of Agriculture 
Credit. They are not being hurt by the problem because they 
continue to receive the benefits of financial facilities; there 
are no problems there. The problem lies with the medium-sized 
farmers -- the medium-sized producers -- and not with the large 
producers who have guaranteed finances. There is a large number 
of farmers who are not adversely affected by the financial and 
refinancing problem. I would say that only about 20 percent are 
severely affected. 
<H5>  Economic Turbulence </H5>
  Development Minister Luis Carlos Palacios referred to the 
commitment to social unity. He said: Today, we are experiencing 
economic turbulence caused by special circumstances in which 
there are imbalances in the monetary and foreign exchange 
sectors. It is obvious that these imbalances and higher 
currency prices have a bearing on imports required by the the 
nation's producers. Overall, the nation's producers import 
about 30 percent of their production-related supplies. This is 
a cost that in some way is reflected in the prices. In this 
regard, I would say this does not go against the national 
agreement, and even though we have this problem, the national 
agreement must be advanced. That national agreement outlines 
what can be done when there is instability, which is different 
from what can be done when there is more stability and balance. 
  At the same time, significant efforts are being made in the 
productive sectors to prevent prices from rising above levels 
that can reasonably result from increased costs of imports at a 
higher rate of exchange. 
  In response to a reporter's question, Labor Minister Juan 
Nepomuceno Garrido said judicial branch workers had agreed to 
work toward reconciliation. Yesterday, he noted, the Labor 
Ministry had accepted the controversial list of petitions while 
the Board of Conciliation is being organized. The minister 
added: The 120-hour deadline will be over at the beginning of 
next week, and we have agreed to continue providing essential 
justice services. This is something that should be highlighted, 
because strikes should not be designed to do harm; instead, they 
are to pressure employers to take certain measures. 
  The labor minister recalled that the workers are not 
demanding better salaries as such; rather, they want what they 
were granted by a court decision late last year to be upgraded. 
When reporters told the minister that the CTV [Confederation of 
Venezuelan Workers] had appealed to the court for salary 
increases to be taken into account in the benefits, he replied 
smiling: "This has about as much chance as a snowball in hell." 
  President Caldera will travel to Margarita on Saturday to 
attend the closing of the Venezuelan Press Association's 
conference in the province. This will be at 1900.

  [Text] The transportation strike is in effect throughout 
the metropolitan areas of Caracas, Sucre District, and Carabobo 
State. In terms of Caracas, the city is paralyzed. The strike 
was called because the government owes transportation workers 
student fare subsidies but has failed to pay, despite an earlier 
announcement that the payments will be made. 
  Passenger buses and cabs shut their engines off last night. 
The government has warned it will crack down on any public 
disorder. Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom addressed the 
nation last night and called on students not to be influenced by 
the professional agitators taking advantage of the 
transportation strike. The government, through the Interior 
Ministry, called today's transportation strike illegal and urged 
reflection on the situation. The minister also said the 
transportation strike is unfounded. He said the government has 
the funds to pay the subsidy on preferential student bus fares, 
which is the reason behind the call for the strike. 
  [Begin Escovar recording] A strike like this affects the 
poorer sectors of the population and harms the general interest 
of the community. Therefore, it is an affront against the 
nation's basic interests, which the government is obliged to 
defend as established by the Constitution and the law. [end 
recording] 
  Minister Escovar Salom reminded the transportation workers 
that routes and permits are granted by the government and must 
be used to serve the public and not personal interest.

<F P=106> [Interview with Simon Ladera, head of the Union of Small </F>
Transportation Vans and Buses of Venezuela, by "180 Minutes of 
News" reporter Maria Acorte at union headquarters in Caracas; 
from the "Union Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Acorte] What is your opinion of the transportation 
strike so far? Did the bus lines you called to strike respond? 
  [Ladera] Up until now, all bus lines affiliated with the 
union have complied with the union mandate. One must 
acknowledge when the workers are right. We have said that the 
government owes us money and that the government has to pay. 
  [Acorte] What is the amount the national government must pay 
for the special student bus rates? 
  [Ladera] The government owes us 300 million bolivars. It 
owes the rest of the nation's transportation sector 
approximately 3 billion bolivars. This amount was due by May. 
By July the subsidization system should be changed. It is sad 
that the deputy transportation and communications ministers say 
there is corruption [words indistinct]. One asks: How can there 
be corruption on the outside without corruption on the inside? 
So, to avoid this problem, and for the students and 
transportation workers to be happy, we should change the 
subsidization system that expires on 31 July. 
  [Acorte] Last night, in a news conference, Foreign Relations 
Minister Ramon Escovar Salom, national government spokesman, 
announced the government already has enough funds to pay the 
money owed for the special student bus rate -- the subsidy. Did 
you receive any notice to suspend the strike? 
  [Ladera] We have not received any notice. I also heard the 
foreign minister. I also want to say publicly that this strike 
is not fostered by any political motive. I know Dr. Caldera 
very well. I am a great admirer of Dr. Caldera. Therefore, 
there is no political issue here; this is not what is prompting 
this action. We are motivated by a desire to avoid problems in 
today's Venezuela. 
  I also want to tell the students that their bus rate will 
not 
change and that we will not refuse them transportation, 
regardless of whether or not the government pays us. Therefore, 
the students do not have to protest, because the student bus 
rate has not....[pauses] If there are irregularities, if a 
driver refuses to transport a student, please report him. 
However, we do not want to give the impression that we are 
protesting because of the special student bus rate. 
  [Acorte] In your opinion, what is needed to end the strike? 
Would it be the cash payment of the money owed, or would you 
accept government vouchers? 
  [Ladera] We are not going to accept vouchers. If the 
government has the money, it should pay the workers, either by 
check or in cash, whichever it prefers. We can accept the 
payment in installments -- whatever the government wants. No 
matter what, we want our payment.

  [Text] Caracas, 9 May (AFP) -- University students staged 
flash demonstrations at noon today in downtown Caracas and 
burned a vehicle distributing office paper, according to 
Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) officers. Police said the 
university group was protesting a decision by transportation 
workers not to honor bus rates for students. 
  Despite a vast police deployment along the streets of the 
capital in the wake of a strike by 35,000 drivers, demonstrators 
from the National University of Venezuela (UCV) marched to the 
entrance of Venezuela Plaza. After briefly blocking traffic, 
they closed in on the delivery vehicle and forced its occupants 
to get out. After that, they set the vehicle ablaze and fled. 
  Student protests erupted last Thursday when students from 
Fermin Toro High School staged major disturbances near 
Miraflores presidential palace, which ended with the death of 
student German Sotillo.

  A partial transportation sector strike in Caracas was 
resolved this afternoon. [Words indistinct] once a meeting with 
the top transportation and communications authorities. In the 
country there is a climate of social unrest and dissatisfaction 
resulting from the economic crisis, said Government Minister 
Ramon Escovar Salom at the presidential building. He said that, 
despite the partial transportation sector strike, there is calm 
in the country. 
  [Begin Escovar recording] The people are fed up with the 
interruption of normal life in Venezuelan cities. The people 
want peace, calm, and work. They want to be able to work in 
peace. Hence, all movements aimed at stopping normal activities 
in the country are doomed to fail sooner or later. The people 
repudiate these alterations of public order. And this will be 
clearly demonstrated in a few days. The government enjoys the 
nation's trust because strikes will not resolve the current 
difficulties. These interruptions only aggravate the economic 
crisis and prevent the country from concentrating its resources 
to overcome the crisis. Those who can aggravate the crisis can 
declare strikes but they are resisted by the country's majority. 
This is what I have to say today. The reports I have received 
is that the country is calm. [end recording]

  [Text] Last night, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro made a 
technical stopover in Accra, Ghana, on his way to South Africa, 
where he will attend the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as that 
nation's first black president. Despite the briefness of the 
visit, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings declared Castro's 
stopover an official visit. 
  In remarks made in Barbados, where he participated in the 
first Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small 
Island States, Castro said that in keeping with our 
revolutionary convictions, we feel solidarity with all African 
nations. He added that Mandela is the leader with the necessary 
talent and wisdom required right now in South Africa. 
  During his last day in Barbados, Castro was moved and 
saddened upon throwing a wreath into the Caribbean off the coast 
where, 18 years ago, a Cuban commercial plane sank, sabotaged by 
individuals paid by the U.S. CIA.

  [Text] Mexico City, 9 May (Notimex) -- It is necessary to 
prevent misunderstandings or rifts between Mexico and the United 
States as a consequence of unilateral actions that upset any of 
the parties, Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello Macias has stated. 
  Opening the 11th U.S.-Mexican Bilateral Commission, the 
Mexican foreign secretary said that relations between the two 
countries are at a great moment in time, adding that he hopes 
the work being done by both delegations "will contribute to 
strengthening our ties." 
  Speaking to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
other officials from the two countries, Tello Macias explained 
that Mexico has launched reforms and significant changes for 
promoting growth, controlling inflation, fighting poverty, and 
opening the economy to world competition. Tello Macias 
emphasized that "we are the first to admit that there is still a 
lot to be done and we are encouraged to see that our efforts and 
sacrifices are producing the desired results." 
  He said the current administration's basic goal is to place 
Mexico in an international position that enables it to use the 
opportunities presented by global reorganization, "as an active 
participant in the changes that occur rather than as a passive 
and indifferent spectator." 
  The Mexican diplomat said that, given their proximity, 
asymmetric capabilities, individual historical experiences, and 
diverse cultures, "ties between the two countries are the most 
complex in the world." He said: This happens because ties among 
academicians, scientists, businessmen, and organizations on both 
sides of the border represent a universe of societal contacts 
that frequently surpass the interaction between the two 
governments. 
  Tello Macias explained that, given this reality, it is 
important to cultivate bilateral relations with talent, which 
implies having effective institutional channels that facilitate 
dialogue and cooperation. The foreign minister admitted that 
cultural differences "and economic disparities between our 
countries" cannot be neglected, but that "interests based on our 
common presence in the same geographical zone prevail and these 
interests are strengthened with commercial integration." 
  He emphasized that the meeting's agenda clearly proves the 
richness and complexity of relations between Mexico and the 
United States and the responsibility of finding reasonable 
formulas to resolve any problems between the two countries.

  [Text] General Mario Rene Enriquez Morales, the national 
defense minister, announced yesterday that the Guatemalan Army 
has accepted the creation of a Truth Commission. Once 
installed, it must investigate the military institution and all 
those sectors that have collaborated with the guerrillas since 
1960. Several civilian and social organizations have requested 
that the creation of this commission be approved during the 
negotiation process ever since talks between the Government 
Peace Commission and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity 
(URNG) began in January. 
  However, before leaving his office at the National Palace, 
the minister said: "In order for this all to be fair and just, 
the commission, if approved, must specifically investigate those 
who have collaborated with the URNG and have remained anonymous 
for over 33 years." He gave no names when asked who he thought 
were collaborators, but listed, for example, students, 
professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and countries 
which have aided the subversives financially and intellectually. 
  He reaffirmed that the Army's true position has not changed 
inasmuch as it does not want to see any further polarization of 
the community. Enriquez stressed that he does not mind the 
commission being installed, as long as there are equal 
conditions for all parties. 
  Although the Information and Press Department of the Army 
remained totally quiet on whether they accept the Truth 
Commission or not, civilian groups insist that it is necessary 
for the country. They expressed their support for statements by 
Gen. Enriquez when he said that he did not want to see further 
polarization.

  [Text] Managua, 9 May (NOTIMEX) -- Nicaraguan President 
Violeta Chamorro today denied that the United States had issued 
an "ultimatum" to her government to solve the problem of 
confiscated properties of U.S. citizens. Upon her return from 
Costa Rica, Chamorro rejected "U.S. pressure, I do not like 
pressure," while she denied that a law passed by U.S. President 
William Clinton on 30 April was an "ultimatum for Nicaragua." 
  This law, approved by the U.S. Congress on 19 April, granted 
the Latin American nations a 90-day period after its 
ratification to solve U.S. citizens' expropriations of assets. 
  Chamorro urged Former President Daniel Ortega (1985-1990) to 
return the home he lives in, being claimed by former banker 
Jaime Morales Carazo and his wife, of whom it is only known that 
she is of Mexican origin. She urged those who benefited by the 
Sandinist law-decree in 1990 during the transition period known 
as "the pinata-like" give away, to return the homes they had 
received. 
  The president acknowledged that the property conflict 
represents "a terrible problem" for which a satisfactory 
solution for all parties has not been reached. She said that 
the return of confiscated properties in the custody of the new 
owners since 1990 would help her government. The government has 
received at least 5,400 claims that involve more than 16,000 
properties of which 400 belong to U.S. citizens, according to 
official statistics. 
  Luis Humberto Guzman, president of the parliament, traveled 
to Washington to inquire about the scope of the U.S. law that 
imposes restrictions on disbursements of foreign aid to nations 
that do not solve the claims of confiscations from U.S. citizens. 
  Last weekend, Chamorro traveled to Costa Rica to participate 
in the inauguration of that nation's president, Jose Maria 
Figueres.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 7 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today appointed lawyers Acisclo 
Valladares as the new attorney general and Ranses Cuestas as the 
new prosecutor general. Valladares is reassuming the post he 
held during the government of overthrown President Jorge Serrano 
(1991-1993). 
  Before swearing in the new officials, President de Leon 
Carpio explained that the new attorney general will serve as an 
adviser and consultant to state institutions. 
  Valladares left office in 1993 after being suspended. At 
that time the courts charged that Valladares had refrained from 
bringing fraud charges against his brother Luis Domingo 
Valladares. 
  Presidency sources told ACAN-EFE that Cuestas, a lawyer with 
30 years experience, has never held a public office. 
  Valladares and Cuestas will assume the offices Telesforo 
Guerra Cahn held simultaneously. The attorney general was 
chosen directly by the president while the prosecutor general 
was chosen from among six candidates presented by a nominating 
committee headed by the Supreme Court of Justice.

<F P=106> [News conference by President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares </F>
with unidentified reporters upon his arrival at the Presidential 
Palace; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] ...do you think there should be a second 
round of elections in the next electoral process? 
  [Perez Balladares] This has not been the custom in the past. 
Traditionally, victory has always been acknowledged with less 
than 50 percent of the vote. However, this topic could be 
discussed. I believe Panamanians have the last word on this 
issue. 
  [Reporter] What do you expect of the meeting you will have 
with President Endara? 
  [Perez Balladares] President Endara announced a long time 
ago 
that he would invite the elected candidate, immediately after 
his victory, to start talking about government transition 
issues. He has kept his word by inviting us this afternoon, and 
we accepted his invitation with pleasure. 
  [Reporter] How does Dr. Perez Balladares assess this 
invitation? 
  [Perez Balladares] I believe it is part of the democratic 
process, of the change of government that has to take place on 1 
September. President Endara, in keeping with his promise, is 
trying to make the transition as smooth as possible to benefit 
the entire country. 
  [Reporter] Does the meeting have an agenda? 
  [Perez Balladares] No, there is no special agenda. We are 
going to talk about general topics, I suppose. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Perez Balladares] No, not yet. 
  [Reporter] Drug trafficking is becoming a problem in Latin 
America. Panama is becoming an essential bridge for drug 
trafficking activities. What are you going to do to stop drug 
trafficking activities during your administration? 
  [Perez Balladares] We will do all we can to stop drug 
trafficking activities and the use of drugs in our country. 
  [Reporter] Including the laundering of drug money? 
  [Perez Balladares] Yes of course. 
  [Reporter] What measures will you implement? 
  [Perez Balladares] Well, we will implement many measures, 
but 
this is not the right time to discuss this issue. 
  [Reporter] The voting results show you still do not have a 
majority in the Legislative Assembly. How do you think this 
will influence your government? 
  [Perez Balladares] I believe we have the obligation to 
accept 
the mandate of the Panamanians, and they have not given us a 
majority in the Assembly. This will force us to find ways to 
talk and communicate with other political forces so our 
government program can [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] At a news conference this morning, Ruben Dario 
Carles said he would make a better president than you. [words 
indistinct] 
  [Perez Balladares] That is not what the Panamanian people 
think. Thanks boys. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] opposition to President 
Endara's government? 
  [Perez Balladares] What did you say? 
  [Reporter] You have always been against President Endara's 
government. How do you think [words indistinct]? 
  [Perez Balladares] I think it will go well. I believe the 
Panamanian political sector has shown extraordinary maturity 
during this electoral process, and this shows -- it is an effort 
we have all made, including President Endara -- a commitment to 
continuing on this path, and it shows that we have a commitment 
to fully democratize the country. Without doubt, the phase of 
confrontation and distrust has ended, and the country is opening 
the door to the 21st century with greater political maturity. 
Excuse me, boys, I have to go. The president is waiting for me.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with presidential candidate </F>
Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic Revolutionary Party 
by James Aparicio at the International Hotel in Panama City on 8 
May; all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, virtual president-elect of 
Panama, has appealed for the building of a future Panama 
"united, without hate, rancor, or revenge," and he announced 
that the country is entering a new stage of national life in 
which one must prepare to enter the 21st century. 
  Perez Balladares, 47, was proclaimed the Panamanian 
presidential candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party 
[PRD] on 31 July 1993. He will govern for the next five years, 
with his two Vice Presidents Tomas Gabriel Altamirano Duque and 
Felipe Virzy, all founding members of the PRD. 
  "The time of electoral confrontation has passed and we must 
enter the 21st century with a vision of the future, with a 
commitment to our children and grandchildren, "without returning 
to the past or linking with the past," Perez Balladares said in 
an exclusive interview with LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA. 
  From the opposition PRD campaign headquarters in the 
International Hotel, Perez Balladares said his election "is a 
very big challenge which we gladly accept." 
  "We foresaw it a long time ago, as it was predicted by the 
polls," Perez Balladares stated. 
  "We want to do what we pledged during the campaign, by 
appealing to all Panamanians for national harmony so that 
tonight we can close the electoral chapter and join together to 
work for the best national objectives," Perez Balladares told LA 
ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, after learning the results of the exit poll." 
  Perez Balladares said political banners will return again in 
five years, "when we have elections again, when the democratic 
process will again be respected and the winner of the elections 
will be recognized." 
  Regarding the composition of his council of ministers, once 
his victory is confirmed, Perez Balladares said he is inviting 
an undetermined number of "those who have been our adversaries 
and some independent forces" to join us. 
  "We are sure that very soon we will be able to count on the 
participation of these gentlemen and on members of our party 
(the PRD) in a cabinet that will work in harmony for national 
interests," Perez Balladares added. 
  Regarding relations with the United States, Perez Balladares 
said that his election "closed the black chapter of military 
intervention" that began on 20 December 1989. 
  "The election of my government has made it clear that this 
sad page in the history of both countries has been turned," 
Perez Balladares stressed. 
  "We hope our relations (with the United States) become 
better 
every day because we must cooperate to meet the timetable from 
now until 31 December 1999," he said. 
  He added that Panama wants "closer" cooperation with the 
United States on drug trafficking and money laundering, as well 
as with other countries "which see in the scourge of drug 
trafficking a national problem as we do." 
  Commenting on the future of the Canal and U.S. military 
bases, Perez Balladares said that it is best for both countries 
"to comply with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties." 
  "This means that on 31 December 1999 the Canal will be 
Panamanian and will be managed totally by Panamanians." 
  According to Perez Balladares, on that day (31 December 
1999) 
there should be no more U.S. troops in Panama, adding that if 
the United States wants to renegotiate an extension of their 
presence beyond the year 2000, "they must state that desire." 
  He warned, however, that his government would have to be 
convinced "that there is a common enemy and that U.S. military 
interests coincide with Panama's." 
  Perez Balladares said he hopes Panama will return to the 
times of General Omar Torrijos, when the country was "respected 
for our dignity and our serious and straightforward attitude." 
  In terms of the country's economic future, he said he will 
begin a dialogue to introduce Panama into areas that are most 
appropriate for the country in order to be directly included 
--without going through regional integration blocs -- in the 
NAFTA signed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 
  "If we do not manage to do this directly, we will begin 
integration contacts with the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur)," he noted. 
  On the subject of banana quotas imposed by the EU since 
July, 
Perez Balladares said that the measure "is very harmful" for us 
and should be resolved through the GATT.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Itamar Franco from </F>
Planalto Palace on 9 May -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. President of the Federal Senate, Mr. President 
of the Chamber of Deputies, Mr. President of the Federal Supreme 
Court, Mr. Government Leader at the Chamber of Deputies, Messrs. 
Federal Senators and Deputies, Messrs. Ministers, ladies and 
gentlemen, young men and young ladies: We are nearing a very 
important moment in Brazilian life. The moment at which we will 
change our currency, our money. Like a country's flag, the 
currency of a country is a symbol of its sovereignty. The 
currency represents the country's power, the confidence it 
awakens in everyone. This is the importance of our efforts to 
give Brazil a currency that will really symbolize our 
independence and the will of our people. 
  This is why the three branches of the Republic are meeting 
here. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches are 
gathered in this decisive moment of our nation. Brazilian 
workers in May, for the second consecutive month, received their 
salaries in Real Value Units, URV's. They saw that their salary 
had been compensated against the April inflation rate. This, 
however, is not enough. A great deal more must be done and this 
is what we are doing now. 
  Through the implementation of the URV, we have taken a very 
important step, but now is the time to take a decisive step 
against inflation and in favor of development. This will happen 
with the implementation of the real, which will be the new 
Brazilian currency. The real will enter our daily lives and 
replace the real cruzeiro and the URV, which was simply a 
stepping-stone from a devaluated currency to a strong one. 
  With all prices and utility rates converted into the new 
currency, our salaries will not loose their purchasing power 
during the month and we will learn the genuine value of things. 
The real will be the currency of a Brazil that will not have an 
inflation rate as high as the current one. In addition to 
defeating inflation, the real will solve the problems that 
workers and retirees still have when salaries in URV's are paid 
in real cruzeiros. Why does this occur? Because the URV 
protects the salaries until payday. From then on and until the 
next payday, salaries converted into real cruzeiros continue to 
be eroded by inflation unless they are invested in the banks. 
Through the real, the money in the workers' pockets will 
preserve its value. This is why, like other Brazilians, I wish 
to see the real implemented soon. 
  I came here today to tell you that the real will be the 
Brazilian currency as of 1 July. I would have preferred to 
announce the arrival of the real after the provisional measure 
had been approved by the Congress. This approval remains 
essential. The government has rewritten the provisional measure 
hoping it may be approved soon, as most Brazilians wish. 
  As everyone knows, the government committed itself to 
announce the arrival of the real at least 30 days before the 
implementation date. I am announcing the implementation of the 
real 52 days before the implementation date to give the people 
more time to prepare for its arrival calmly and securely. I 
have asked the finance minister to release, as soon as possible, 
an agenda of the measures that we will adopt along the path that 
leads to the implementation of the real. The most important 
rules about the real will be announced well in advance. They 
will be announced during the month of June. I am personally 
interested in giving all Brazilians enough time to prepare for 
the change and to allow all of them to learn everything possible 
about the new currency. 
  We will make a great effort to explain the real. I have 
instructed the finance minister to tour the country and to 
explain everything about the plan that implements the real and 
about the new currency itself. Everything will be carefully 
reported and explained. Nothing will be done through surprises 
or frights. This is the main characteristic of this 
administration's economic policy. We know well what is at 
stake. We know that not just figures, which very few can 
understand, are at stake. We know that our daily life, our 
purchasing power, the food that we place on our tables, our 
children's education, and the wellbeing of the elderly are at 
stake. We know that the health of all Brazilians and everything 
else will improve when we manage to finally defeat inflation. 
  Brazil knows me. It is known that I am of the people. 
Brazil knows that I share all Brazilians' distress about 
inflation. This is why I have confidence in our economic plan 
and am committed to its success. I want to hand the president, 
whom the Brazilian people will elect this year, a country with 
its economy in order; a well organized country that will allow 
the government to fulfill its duties and in which workers will 
no longer be distressed by inflation. 
  We now have the indispensable conditions to make this 
happen. 
I have many reasons to believe that. We have solved the 
foreign debt problem that harmed Brazil for more than 10 years. 
We have balanced the federal budget. The government no longer 
spends more than it collects, and we no longer have to issue 
money which in turn creates inflation. Many sectors of our 
economy are again growing. This year we will harvest the 
largest crop in history. The URV is fulfilling its role of 
ensuring the average purchasing power of salaries and of 
stabilizing prices prior to the arrival of the real. Industry 
and the government have converted most of their prices and 
utility rates into URV's. 
  I normally do not promise things that I cannot fulfill or 
commit myself to projects in which I do not believe. If I am 
here today to ask the country to believe in the real it is 
because I believe in it, it is because I am certain that we are 
now ready for it, and it is because I know that only when the 
economy is in order can everyone begin to profit, particularly 
the most destitute and the workers who live on their wages and 
have no means to protect themselves from inflation. 
  We are all part of a large family, a large nation. We must 
be strong; we must be firm; we must be specially determined. It 
is our responsibility to make Brazil the prosperous and generous 
country that we all want it to be. Let us then believe in the 
real plan. This plan was drafted during former Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso's days at the head of the Finance Ministry and 
is now being implemented by Minister Rubens Ricupero. Thank you 
very much.

within that institution. 
  "Gen. Edmundo Luna has asked for a discharge and will be 
replaced in the next few days through the normal Armed Forces 
promotion process," Gallardo added. The defense minister

<F P=106> [Report by Victoria Palant] </F>
  [Text] Rome, 5 May (EFE) -- Peruvian Prime Minister Efrain 
Goldenberg today signed an "agreement to promote and protect 
foreign investments" with outgoing Italian Prime Minister Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi. 
  Goldenberg arrived here on the night of 4 May on a private 
visit. He told EFE that the agreement "is highly significant" 
for his country, which is seeking to attract investors "not just 
in Europe, but worldwide." Earlier, Goldenberg visited Milan 
and Stockholm. 
  Peru has signed similar agreements with Switzerland, France, 
Sweden, Paraguay, Colombia, and Thailand; and it will soon sign 
another one with Spain. 
  Goldenberg said: "Peruvian laws do not discriminate between 
foreign and domestic capital; each receive equal guarantees. 
The Peruvian state does not reserve for itself areas of vital 
interest." 
  Goldenberg, who is both prime minister and foreign minister 
of Peru, cites as an example that "a Spanish company paid $2 
billion for 35 percent of a now-privatized telephone company," 
adding: "Telecommunications are usually considered of vital 
interest." 
  Goldenberg added that an agreement signed with the Swedish 
Government will help to expedite mining exploitation in Peru. 
  Goldenberg said: "More mining deposits have been discovered 
in the past 18 months than in the entire history of the Republic 
and Swedish industries are very interested in supplying 
equipment and technology." 
  Goldenberg declined to comment on the ongoing investigations 
by Rome's prosecutor Vittorio Paraggio into alleged cases of 
corruption within the framework of Italian-Peruvian cooperation. 
He said that his tour primarily seeks to attract Swedish and 
Italian investors. 
  Goldenberg stated: "Foreign investment is productive; it 
produces quick results and it does not fuel inflation." He 
added: "Contrary to what many people believe, drug trafficking 
money -- moral considerations aside -- is harmful because it 
provides masses of money the country does not need." 
  Goldenberg said: "I did not come here to say that we do not 
have problems, because we do. It is important to report that 
last year the country grew by 7 percent and that during the 
first quarter of this year we have grown by an unprecedented 8.6 
percent." 
  Noting that, during the five-year tenure of Alan Garcia, 
Peru 
"reached the worst level of hyperinflation ever registered in 
world history: 2.2 million percent," Goldenberg said. He added 
that the current figures clearly show progress has been made 
because "in 1990, inflation stood at 7,650 percent; in 1991, at 
150 percent; in 1992 at 70 percent; and in 1993, at 39 percent." 
  Goldenberg conceded that "unemployment is still high," but 
noted that government policy considers "jobs will be created 
through growth," that the state cannot bear the useless burden 
of public employees, and that "any job is a good job." 
  This afternoon Goldenberg addressed members of 
Confindustria, 
the association of Italian businessmen, within the framework of 
a seminar on the analysis of economic prospects offered by Peru 
to Italian investors. He told EFE: "Peruvian foreign currency 
reserves already exceed $3 billion." 
  Goldenberg noted: "In 1960 Peru exported 10 times as much as 
South Korea and carried much more weight in the world. It will 
take time, however, to regain the levels of production we 
achieved then." 
  In his opinion, all this is the result of "mistaken 
macroeconomic policies and ideas that have not worked anywhere 
in the world." 
  Goldenberg met this morning with Italian President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro. He will return to Peru tomorrow after a 
scheduled stopover in Costa Rica.

  [Text] Santiago, 6 May (EFE) -- The Declaration of Santiago 
on the exercise of the profession of journalism was approved 
here today by all delegates except for those from Chile and 
Venezuela. 
  After a heated debate, the declaration was approved. It 
summarizes in 10 points the five days of work carried out during 
the seminar on the Development of the Media and Democracy in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, which began on 2 May and which 
was organized by UNESCO, the United Nations, and the Chilean 
Government. 
  The Santiago Declaration was approved by consensus, except 
for article eight to which the Chilean and Venezuelan 
journalists associations objected. They favor unconditional 
exercise of journalism. 
  The confrontation was between the Chilean Journalists 
Association and the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA), 
which groups continental written media owners. 
  In its main points, the Santiago Declaration remarks that 
freedom of expression "is the cornerstone" of democracy and that 
it is essential for peace and development. 
  The 400 delegates to the seminar ask governments to 
guarantee 
freedom of expression and their professional work, and they 
condemn the violence to which some journalists are subjected, as 
well as all prohibitions and controls.

  [Excerpt] Panamanian President-elect Ernesto Perez 
Balladares has asserted that during his term, the Panamanian 
Government will maintain dignified and respectful relations with 
Cuba. Perez Balladares confirmed that the ties with Cuba will be 
equal to those maintained with any other nation. He went on to 
say that ties between Cuba and Panama will be characterized by 
respect for their existing political systems and noninterference 
in the internal affairs of either nation. 
  Relations between these nations became virtually nonexistent 
following the violent U.S. invasion of Panama on 20 December 
1989, and at the moment, contacts are conducted at interim 
charge d'affaires level. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Chilean Foreign Ministry has announced that soon 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will receive an official 
invitation to visit Chile in the near future. Jose Miguel 
Insulsa, deputy secretary of Foreign Relations, made the 
announcement in Santiago de Chile. Insulsa stated it will be 
beneficial to conduct an exchange of opinions on international 
politics and the current situation in Cuba. 
  Insulsa pointed out that the visit's agenda has yet to be 
finalized, but mentioned that important issues would include the 
ongoing U.S. economic blockade of Cuba and Cuba's ties with the 
hemisphere. Insula pointed out that differences in political 
systems is no obstacle to the existence of diplomatic relations 
between Cuba and Chile.

  [Text] Havana, 10 May (DPA) -- Shortages and material 
limitations, which have gotten worse since the beginning of the 
1990's, prompt Cuban citizens to escape the island, according to 
a poll carried out by a Havana University branch. "This 
situation increases the dissatisfaction of potential illegal 
emigrants and magnifies their individual and professional 
frustrations," the Political Alternatives Studies Center has 
indicated. 
  The study is based on a poll carried out among people who 
tried to escape the island. Sixty percent of the people polled 
alleged that they had tried to escape because of economic 
reasons associated to material needs in the housing and consumer 
areas. The results of the study published today indicate that 
54.7 percent of the people said they wanted to emigrate to the 
United States due to personal aspirations; 28.4 percent 
mentioned the search for personal freedom; and 16.3 percent 
cited family reasons. One of the family-related reasons given 
by the people polled was to alleviate their economic status in 
the United States because they did not think Cuba had the proper 
conditions for establishing a family. They also cited reasons 
related to family reunification. 
  The poll revealed that 31 percent of the people interviewed 
had expressed differences or dissatisfaction with the Cuban 
political-social program. In this sense, "they judged the 
economic policy to be inadequate and underscored problems other 
than the ones brought about by the special period, such as the 
depreciation of work, the handling of religious beliefs, and the 
existence of marked social inequalities." The fact that the 
people polled hoped to find a network of relatives and friends 
who would welcome them abroad was another factor in their 
decision to abandon the island, the Havana University branch 
pointed out. 
  A recent U.S. Coast Guard Service report recently published 
in Havana revealed that 2,173; 2,557; and 3,656 Cubans had 
reached the coast of Florida in 1991, 1992, and 1993, 
respectively. Meanwhile, the official BOHEMIA magazine revealed 
that there had been 5,597, 7,053, and 10,579 foiled escape 
attempts during that same period.

<F P=106> [By reporter Roger Ricardo Luis] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Pages 4 and 5 of today's GRANMA 
carries an interview with Public Health Minister Julio Jesus 
Teja Perez by reporter Jose Antonio de Oca in which the minister 
outlines the details of the country's strategy for production 
and distribution of medicines, based on the country's potential 
and available resources. 
  I will read passages of this interview, which was published 
today on pages 4 and 5. It says that medical control will begin 
on 16 May in Havana City and that it will gradually be extended 
throughout the country. The objective is to increase the level 
of satisfaction as guarantees are strengthened to distribute the 
medicines the people need; to reduce the number of medicines not 
readily available; and to systematically prevent the 
embezzlement, for increased profit which occurs with this type 
of product. 
  The success of this plan will depend to a large extent on 
the 
cooperation and understanding of our doctors, on those 
responsible for administration, and on pharmaceutical experts. 
  Some provinces that began to develop initiatives in this 
area 
have implemented most of the measures adopted in Havana City, 
with positive results even when experiencing greater shortages 
than in the capital. One of the first measures seeks to fight 
speculation and hoarding, in an effort to tighten relations 
between the community and drug stores. Approximately 30 
medicines can therefore be purchased at the drug store nearest 
the individual's residence by presenting the ration book for 
identification of the family group. 
  Medicines will not be sold through preestablished quotas, 
but 
in an individual manner, based on availability of these 
medicines. A list of residences will be required, to register 
all possible consumers. 
  The pharmacies will sell various products such as boric 
acid, 
camphorated pomade, aspirin, (pasta lazar), magnesium sulfate, 
and (citrogal), among others. The links that will be established 
between family groups and their neighborhood drug stores do not 
exclude the purchase of prescribed medicines from other 
pharmacies, taking into account that each doctor or dentist must 
have his name officially registered in the drug store near his 
workplace. This means that the health units will also be linked 
to the neighborhood drug stores where patients will be able to 
acquire the medications indicated by the emergency service or by 
consultation. The same goes for those already discharged from 
the hospital, but who need to continue their treatment. In 
Havana City especially, pediatric doctors, surgeons, and others 
will have one intrahospital pharmacy for the purchase of the 
medications prescribed by the emergency service. 
  The 73 medicines sold today through cards, for the treatment 
of chronically ill people who require lengthy treatment, will be 
purchased from special drug stores through the appropriate 
health field. 
  Current medical prescription models will be changed. The old 
ones must be presented at the pharmacy, together with the new 
prescription, to obtain the prescribed medicine. Medical 
prescriptions for the purchase of antibiotics and other 
medications will have a time limit. If the medicines are not 
purchased within that period of time, the validity of the 
prescription is automatically canceled and will thus require a 
new medical examination.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon] </F>
  [Text] While the majority of Cubans seek the most suitable 
way to increase productivity and efficiency, and while the 
government seeks to reorganize the country's financial system, a 
small number of people aim to enrich themselves at the expense 
of the material needs of the people. During times of crisis, 
the government is obliged to protect the fair distribution of 
material goods. Some citizens, however, illegally procure goods 
and raw materials from state-owned stores and later sell them on 
the black market at astronomical prices. 
  As a result of theft, speculation, shady deals, and other 
practices common in an underground economy, a limited number of 
citizens have accumulated wealth and goods, which they have even 
ostentatiously displayed to most of their countrymen who, today, 
are forced to live in austerity. Other people, who also shun 
honest work, buy or make articles that they later sell to people 
at high prices, taking advantage of the needs of those suffering 
the effects of the economic crisis caused by external forces. 
  This small group of citizens is rejected by most Cubans, who 
by making great sacrifices resist the attacks of the U.S. 
blockade and the devastating effects of the loss of the 
country's trading partners who belonged to the vanished 
socialist camp. 
  At the 80,000 assemblies convoked by the unions early in the 
year, more than 3 million workers demanded that the state adopt 
strong measures to confiscate the goods and incomes of persons 
who enrich themselves illegally. During the recently concluded 
special session of the Cuban parliament, the deputies echoed the 
peoples' categorical rejection of the unscrupulous activities of 
those who unlawfully amass fortunes at the expense of the needs 
of the majority of Cubans. 
  Because it is a national necessity and is of social interest 
and to the benefit of the public, the National Assembly of the 
People's Government entrusted the Council of State and the 
government with adopting measures, including extraordinary 
measures upheld by the Constitution, to eradicate the 
aforementioned aberrations. 
  This week, Decree-Law No. 149, which involves the 
confiscation of goods and income obtained through illegal 
enrichment and supports energetic actions by the authorities, 
was disclosed. 
  As it did at the beginning of the Revolution, the Cuban 
State 
is acting against a minority of citizens who have hoarded goods 
and money illegally, in brazen and demoralizing defiance of the 
principles of social justice that prevail in the country.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Antonio Guiteras 
thermoelectric plant in Matanzas is operating at full capacity 
and absolute efficiency. This plant resumed operations Saturday 
afternoon after a brief 72-hour down time period for maintenance. 
  Engineer Jesus Valdez Torra, plant director, reported that 
all defects have been fully eradicated. Therefore, the plant 
will be fully operative until the next maintenance period, which 
will require six days. 
  The engineer added that maintenance work will also be done 
on 
another 330 megawatt unit. This work will include regulating the 
valves and cleaning the boiler walls. 
  The Antonio Guiteras plant has provided more than 500,000 
megawatt-hours to date and expects to conclude the year with a 
total of 2.2 million megawatt-hours, 10 percent of the total 
amount of electricity generated by Cuba's Electric Union.

  [Text] In Santiago de Cuba, Basic Industries Minister 
Marcos Portal has announced that repair and maintenance 
resources for electrical plants are arriving in Cuba given the 
economic importance of electrical generation. Portal addressed 
the workers of the Rente Antonio Maceo Electric Plant and told 
them that in July, maintenance work will immediately begin on 
Unit 6 once the reconstruction of Unit 4 is completed. After 
those two units are repaired and 12 others receive maintenance 
this year, the generation of electricity in the Rente plant 
should increase to 300 megawatts, 60 percent of its total 
capacity. 
  Portal praised the maintenance and modification work done at 
the Rente plant to enhance circulation, drainage, and equipment.

<F P=106> [By Alonso de Contreras] </F>
  [Text] Santo Domingo, 10 May (EFE) -- The U.S. Government 
has assumed an antagonistic role in the upcoming Dominican 
general elections with the publication of a note by its 
ambassador in Santo Domingo voicing concern over the conditions 
of the upcoming elections. 
  The note, which was rejected last night by President Joaquin 
Balaguer, says: "The importance of the Dominican (democratic) 
achievement increases our concern because of violent incidents 
that have occurred during the electoral campaign and because of 
the belief by some Dominicans that there will be an electoral 
fraud." 
  Last night, a few days before the general elections on 16 
May 
and before the electoral campaign concludes on 14 May, Balaguer 
declared the note issued by U.S. Ambassador Robert Pastorino as 
nonsense. 
  Balaguer stated that the Dominican Republic has achieved 
such 
a level of development that it will not permit laws to be 
violated or the people's will to be mocked this coming Monday. 
  He added that there will not be any fraud because the 
Central 
Electoral Board comprises people of "irreproachable ethics" and 
"also, the country has achieved such a level of development, 
that it will not permit the violation of laws or the mockery of 
the peoples' votes whatsoever." 
  In addition, the U.S. ambassador recognized in his public 
note that "the Central Electoral Board (Dominican), advised by 
international experts, has worked arduously to implement the 
mechanisms that regulate fair elections. "We hope your work 
will pursue that goal. The presence of international observers 
underlines the importance of respecting the legitimacy of the 
people's will. "We appeal to all the participating political 
parties in the Dominican elections to work to curb the climate 
of violence and to promote fair and clean elections." 
  The United States, through its ambassador, also implicitly 
supports the "Civic Pact" proposed by opposition candidate Jose 
Francisco Pena Gomez -- whom it does not cite -- so that no 
party will claim victory before the official results are 
announced. 
  "We applaud the concepts voiced by political leaders in the 
proposed Civic Pact which seeks to ensure an atmosphere of peace 
and order in the elections," the embassy notes says. "The U.S. 
Government and people are completely neutral regarding which 
candidate or political party wins the elections. Nonetheless, 
we are extremely interested in seeing that the people's will be 
respected through fair and honest elections." 
  The U.S. Embassy's entering the Dominican electoral game has 
sparked a national controversy. In addition to the position 
voiced by the president, the opinion of Dominican political 
circles is divided among those who feel that the statement is a 
healthy call for vigilance while others feel that it is an 
interference in the domestic affairs of the country. 
  National Assembly President Jose Oswaldo Leger describes it 
as "meddling" in national internal issues, emphasizing that the 
Dominican people are qualified to resolve, by themselves, 
internal problems resulting from the electoral process. "The 
ambassadors accredited to the country (Dominican Republic) must 
be respectful of our sovereignty," he said. 
  Angel Lockward, leader of the ruling Social Christian 
Reformist Party, agreed with Leger and rejected the U.S. 
Government's note. The public letter, however, was praised by 
other politicians, including Hatuey Decamps, secretary general 
and spokesman for the Dominican Revolutionary Party. 
  Regardless of whether the note represents U.S. interference 
in the Dominican electoral process or not, observers and other 
diplomats in Santo Domingo emphasize that the U.S. remarks are 
like preaching to the choir. 
  In the last part of the Dominican electoral campaign, which 
has been marked from the beginning -- mid-February -- by 
political leaders disavowing each other, there has been a lack 
of government proposals, while violence has claimed at least 10 
lives and all parties have increased their warnings of fraud. 
  When EFE asked a diplomat accredited in Santo Domingo, who 
requested his name not be disclosed, what he thought about the 
U.S. note, he merely answered: "He who has ears should listen."

who were elected on 18 January 1993 in elections described as 
fraudulent, are planning to appoint Judge Emile Jonassain, 
former Supreme Court president, as temporary Haitian president 
tomorrow, 11 May. 
  The legislators, led by Bernard Sansaricq, who leads one of 
the Senate Board of Directors, made the decision today during a 
session described as irregular. Nevertheless, Jonassain said he 
is officially unaware of the decision. 
  Sansaricq sent Jonassain a copy of the decree adopted during 
the session, which has been described as illegal. He also sent 
a copy to General Raoul Cedras, Armed Forces chief, and Frantz 
Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies.

  [Excerpts] A special session -- outside the National 
Assembly -- was held at the Haitian parliament to conclude the 
seventh period of meetings of the 45th Legislature. A number of 
senators and deputies officially announced, on 9 May through 
Senator Bernard Sansaricq, that a new president of Haiti will be 
sworn in, in Haiti, within the next few hours: Judge Emile 
Jonassaint, the current president of the Court of Cassation. 
According to the announcement made by Sen. Sansaricq in the 
presence of a group of parliamentarians, Jonassaint will be 
sworn in on 11 May. 
  Here is a report by Edner Jean on 9 May, the day that was to 
mark the conclusion of the National Assembly, [pauses] the 
conclusion, in national assembly, of the current parliamentary 
session. In the last analysis, the National Assembly was unable 
to convene. 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] [passage omitted] For his part, the 
president of the Chamber of Deputies said it is not up to him to 
rule in favor of one or the other of the two Senate Offices, 
adding immediately thereafter that his office is willing to work 
with whichever Senate Office can gather 14 senators. 
  At that time, Sen. Sansaricq had still been unable to find a 
14th member, something that was virtually impossible to do. 
Exchanges between senators and deputies became very heated. At 
1830, Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde held a 
meeting behind closed doors, but the socialists stuck firmly to 
their position and finally left the room. 
  Sen. Sansaricq's reaction came almost immediately: At 1900, 
he was back at the Senate, this time accompanied by about 15 
deputies, all members of the Alliance for Parliamentary 
Cohesion, and he solemnly announced that Judge Emile Jonassaint 
will be sworn in as the new president of the Republic on 11 May. 
  [Sansaricq] I have already spoken to President Emile 
Jonassaint. The president has completely agreed to be sworn in 
at noon on 11 May, here, before the Senate of the Republic. 
[applause] I also want to announce that the Haitian Army is 
going to snap its fingers at the [word indistinct] of the Senate 
of the Republic. [applause] [passage omitted] 
  [Jean] [passage omitted] There was a surprise. Attracted, 
perhaps, by the atmosphere of this crowd -- to repeat the words 
of Senator Dupiton -- Monde joined the historic meeting. He went 
to the rostrum and took a stand in favor of the meeting and the 
measures being taken. He added, however, that a clear 
distinction should be made between the Monde who is president of 
the Chamber of Deputies and the Monde who is a deputy. Monde was 
warmly applauded by his peers. 
  At 2000, there was a power outage and this group of senators 
and deputies went home, singing the national anthem. This is 
Edner Jean for Radio Metropole. [end recording]

  [Text] In a statement to the press on the night of 9 May, 
Senator Bernard Sansaricq announced that the president of the 
Court of Cassation, attorney Emile Jonassaint, is allegedly 
ready to be installed as president of Haiti. Incidentally, the 
Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion and the legislators elected 
on 18 January 1993 are preparing to install Jonassaint as 
president of Haiti on 11 May. We will have further explanations 
regarding this statement -- made very late last night by Senator 
Sansaricq -- during the newscast.

  [Text] Senator Bernard Sansaricq says Emile Jonassaint will 
be sworn in as president of Haiti on 11 May. Sansaricq made this 
statement before the press, and said that he [not further 
identified] has the support of the Chamber of Deputies to do 
this job, especially the support of President Monde. Monde, 
however, has explained that he gave his opinion on the matter as 
a citizen, and not as the president of the Chamber of Deputies. 
  Everyone is waiting to see: Will Article 149 be implemented? 
Will there be a new president of Haiti? Everyone is waiting; 
meanwhile, the international community is threatening to impose 
a total embargo on Haiti, which will be lifted only when 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns to Haiti. The embargo will be 
relaxed only when three officials of the military high command's 
general staff resign. Only then will the international community 
infer that the Army has decided to comply with the Governors 
Island Agreement. 
  The situation within the Haitian legislature, where 
Sansaricq 
made this decision, remains very very confused. Emile 
Jonassaint, whom Signal FM contacted, said he has not been 
officially informed yet regarding the matter of his installation 
on 11 May. Jonassaint says he heard about it only in the press 
and that he will have to make a decision and take a public 
position -- for he refused to make any statement to Signal FM -- 
once he is officially informed of the matter.

Sansaricq's announcement that Court of Cassation Judge Emile 
Jonassaint will be installed as president of the Republic on 11 
May. Jean Guzman of the Haitian Revolutionary Party [PRH] 
condemns the attitude of the head of the second Senate Office, 
namely Bernard Sansaricq, who he says is trying to lead the 
legislature onto a perilous path. He also let Chamber [of 
Deputies] President Frantz Robert Monde have it! He thinks Monde 
is letting himself be manipulated by Sen. Sansaricq. Guzman, 
leader of the PRH, calls the president of the Chamber of 
Deputies a traveler without a destination.

  [Excerpts] Christian Democratic Assembly leader Eddy Volel, 
reacting to the situation prevailing in parliament, said today 
that only the president of the Republic has the right to convene 
the Chamber of Deputies in extraordinary session. The 
Constitution, in Article 101, does not grant the president of 
the Chamber any right to convene such a session. Neither does it 
authorize him to sit without recess except for emergency cases, 
he stated. [passage omitted] 
  Furthermore, Eddy Volel says he is opposed to the 
installation of Emile Jonassaint as president of the Republic 
because, he says, it is as unconstitutional as it is a blatant 
violation of the 16 December 1990 vote. [passage omitted]

President-in-Exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide said that in case the

overthrow the military. It is a question of political will, he 
said, nevertheless refusing to speak clearly of military 
intervention. He noted: Under the Constitution, if I ask for a 
military intervention, I will be dismissed.

however, explains that this policy is not aimed at protecting 
the millions of Haitians who continue to face political violence. 
  President Aristide explained in the communique that the 
nation is in danger and that among the numbers of Haitians who 
are fleeing repression and political violence in Haiti and who 
will be questioned on the U.S. Coast Guard ships, only a small 
percentage will be granted political asylum. 
  The communique continues... [pauses] in this communique, 
President Aristide praised the U.S. sectors that prompted 
President Clinton to change the policy toward Haitian refugees. 
At the same time, the president-in-exile stated that only his

  [Text] San Jose, 9 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio said today in San Jose that there are no 
major obstacles blocking the signing of a peace agreement with 
the guerrillas before the end of year, adding that the 
appointment of a truth commission could do more harm than good. 
  De Leon said during a news conference that an agreement 
establishing a timetable for the negotiations and an agreement 
on human rights with international verification, which were 
signed last month, make "irreversible" the process to end an 
armed conflict dating back to 1960. 
  The Guatemalan president explained that the main components 
of his peace plan are achieving reconciliation, meeting social 
demands, and ending the armed conflict. He added that these 
goals are supported by most local sectors and by the 
international community. 
  "We have never been so close to peace," de Leon Carpio said. 
He insisted that the human rights agreement was the "Gordian 
knot" of the negotiations, but that as soon as this is overcome 
the process will advance more smoothly. The president, however, 
added that there are certain groups at home or abroad that could 
take advantage of any strike or social movement to create 
instability, but that the government is ready to neutralize 
their actions. 
  As for the establishment of a truth commission or commission 
on the past, de Leon said that, after an analysis on its 
advisability, the government concluded that its results could be 
more negative than favorable to national reconciliation. He 
pointed out that investigations into serious human rights 
violations would be biased against the Army because "there are 
documents only" on this sector and not on the actions carried 
out by the guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity (URNG). 
  "If the goal of that (truth) commission were to strengthen 
peace, the government would support its creation, but it could, 
however, widen the gap, open new wounds, and cause further 
polarization," the head of state added. 
  Ramiro de Leon Carpio insisted that "the ideal" would be for 
Guatemalan society to learn the facts, learn who was 
responsible, and have them face justice, but said that "there 
are conditions that render this difficult -- there is currently 
consensus in this regard -- but the government is always willing 
to discuss this." 
  As for a joint declaration issued on Sunday by the Central 
American presidents in support of peace negotiations in 
Guatemala, de Leon Carpio said that it is a recognition of 
government efforts and an initiative to strengthen the "final 
stretch" of the process. 
  He pointed out that certain rulers, such as Alfredo 
Cristiani 
of El Salvador and Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua, are 
experienced in this kind of process "and understand that the 
final route presents certain obstacles, some of which are 
natural and others provoked." 
  Besides Cristiani and Chamorro, the declaration was signed 
by 
Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who took office on 
Sunday, and by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina. 
  Panamanian President Guillermo Endara attended neither 
Figueres' inaugural nor the "mini-summit" in which economic 
issues were also analyzed, because general elections were being 
held in that country. 
  The rulers called on the URNG to "give clear signs of its 
political determination to reach the firm and lasting peace that 
all Guatemalans are demanding and that all Central Americans 
long for." 
  Ramiro de Leon Carpio, however, pointed out that his 
colleague's call does not mean that the guerrilla group has not 
shown a willingness to end the armed conflict, because it signed 
agreements on human rights and on a timetable for the 
negotiations.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Valeriano Giron] </F>
  [Text] San Jose, Costa Rica -- Honduran President Carlos 
Roberto Reina has stated here that the autonomy of the Honduran 
Armed Forces and its commander will be reviewed shortly. He 
also made reference to military personnel's participation in 
private enterprises and said it is a very sensitive topic that 
the Honduran Congress will have to debate. Those issues were 
brought up at news conference by President Reina with 
international media representatives attending the inaugural 
ceremony of the new Costa Rican president. 
  Reina said civilian society had maintained a fearful 
attitude 
in the past and that this had allowed the military sector to 
obtain too much power over society. As an example, he mentioned 
that, according to the Constitution, the National Congress has 
to establish the amount of troops the armed institution can 
have. However, this has never been done. He pointed out that 
one of the most negative measures implemented by the Armed 
Forces was troop recruitment, since it forced only poor people 
to serve in the institution and excluded the rich ones. A 
positive change, said Reina, is that this system has been 
abolished and that Congress has already approved a new method in 
its first debate. The Armed Forces have also accepted the new 
system. 
<H5>  Military Firms </H5>
  The Honduran president pointed out that Congress will have 
to 
decide whether military personnel can use their retirement funds 
to invest in commercial activities. He believes they have a 
right to do so. However, the problem is that they could use 
their military influence to attain unfair competition vis-a-vis 
the rest of the merchants. The National Congress will discuss 
the issue and reach a final decision on it, Reina asserted. 
  President Reina emphasized that he has never wanted the 
Honduran Armed Forces to be abolished, because he does not 
believe it is in the country's best interest to do so. The 
Honduran Armed Forces, he stated, have asserted that the Costa 
Rican Army is bigger and has a bigger budget, but this is 
something that would have to be studied. [sentence as published] 
Reina said he did not want to argue over this assessment and 
reiterated that it is what the Honduran Armed Forces officers 
maintain. 
  The important thing now, he added, is to go from an absurd 
and inhuman concept, such as the one on national security, to 
the concept of guaranteeing individual security, which we will 
establish because we require a force to ensure this. If a law 
does not have a coercive mechanism, it stops being the law, he 
said. 
  In Reina's opinion, the phase during which an abusive army 
took command of the country has been totally transcended. He 
said all the human rights violations in the country occurred 
when military officers governed the country. He said he was one 
of the Central American citizens who had strongly opposed those 
governments and had even condemned governments formed by his own 
party because he was determined to defend human rights. 
<H5>  Armed Forces Commander </H5>
  Reina was asked about the Armed Forces commander and his 
relations with General Luis Alonso Discua, the current Honduran 
Armed Forces commander. The president said he maintained good, 
cordial relations with Discua. 
  The Honduran president said, however, that in his opinion a 
mistake had been made in the 1957 Constitution in the section 
that establishes the Armed Forces commander's appointment, which 
also gives him too much autonomy in his actions. He added that 
the then Constituent Assembly president had explained that such 
provisions had been included in the Constitution because, 
without them, they could not democratize the country. 
  Reina believes the figure of the Armed Forces commander, as 
well as his autonomy should, perhaps, be reviewed. He emphasized 
that his relations with Gen. Discua are very good and that he 
has no complaints or reasons for distrust. The military 
commander has reiterated this since he accepted subordination to 
the president of the Republic. 
  President Reina mentioned that Gen. Discua's term ends next 
year and his replacement will be selected from a list sent by 
the Armed Forces to the National Congress. He added that, if 
several constitutional amendments are made, the military 
commander would be the defense minister and would be appointed 
by the president of the Republic. 
  Anyway, he added, Honduras is in a straightforward process 
to 
achieve its full democratization and the reassessment of its 
priorities, which is currently the basic position in America and 
the world.

efforts to help the ROC gain deserving status in the 
international community. He also pointed out that it is 
appropriate for the ROC to join the UN and that at every 
occasion Costa Rica will support the ROC, which firmly defends 
democracy and has traditional ties of friendship with Costa Rica. 
  [Begin Figueres recording] We will always stand on the side 
of the ROC and continue to fight for the ROC when necessary, so 
that the ROC will gain deserving status in the international 
community. We will not only continue our support for our 
traditional friend, but also render support, at every 
international occasion, to a country that defends democracy 
consistently. [end recording] 
  President Jose Maria Figueres also expressed his wish to 
visit the ROC after he is sworn in and state affairs are in 
order, so as to draw on the ROC's experiences in every field. 
President Li Teng-hui expressed heartfelt thanks for the 
promise by the new Costa Rican Government. Besides, he 
stressed, as a sovereign state, the ROC is currently practicing 
pragmatic diplomacy and promoting cross-strait relations. There 
is no controversy in doing these simultaneously. He hoped the 
two sides of the strait would achieve mutual understanding. 
There is nothing inappropriate in the ROC trying to find a way 
to practice diplomacy and join the UN. 
  [Begin President Li recording] It is very important for the 
two sides to foster mutual understanding. The ROC, however, 
needs to find a way to practice diplomacy as a sovereign state. 
In my opinion, these activities should proceed simultaneously. 
Since the ROC meets the requirement that a UN member state be 
peace-loving, it is very appropriate for the ROC to join the UN. 
[end recording] 
  When answering a question at the news conference about 
solving the issue of Costa Rica's agricultural development, 
President Li Teng-hui, an agricultural expert, modestly said 
that President Jose Maria Figueres, a former agricultural 
minister, knows more about agriculture than he and surely has 
concrete plans. Li said the ROC Government and the private 
sector will help him fulfill these plans.

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] On the second day of his stay in Costa Rica, 
Republic of China [ROC] President Li Teng-hui, in additional to 
making official calls, met separately with leaders of El 
Salvador and several other nations who were in Costa Rica to 
participate in the inauguration of its new president. These 
meetings, which were among the most important items on the 
schedule of President Li's tour of Central America, are of 
considerable significance for enhancing the ROC's [word 
indistinct] with its friendly nations. During the meetings, it 
was expected that President Li would try to enlist the leaders' 
support for the ROC's bid to participate in UN activities. 
  The day's schedule of important meetings was as follows: At 
1030 on 7 May, President Li met incumbent President Alfredo 
Cristiani and President-Elect Armando Calderon Sol of El 
Salvador. At 1115, he met Angel Roberto Seifart, vice president 
of Paraguay. In the afternoon, he met with Honduran President 
Rafael Leonardo Callejas [as heard] and later with Guatelaman 
President De Leon Carpio. Besides President Li, other heads of 
state who came to participate in the inauguration included the 
leaders of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, and 
Guatelama. 
  President Calderon of the Republic of Costa Rica presented 
Costa Rica's state medal to President Li yesterday. After 
accepting the medal, President Li emphasized that the medal is 
not only a personal honor but also symbolizes the noble and 
sincere friendship between China and Costa Rica. He pledged 
that the ROC Government would continue its efforts to enhance 
cooperation with the Costa Rican Government. China Broadcasting 
Corporation special correspondent Kang You-feng filed the 
following report: 
  The presentation ceremony was held on the evening of 6 May, 
Costa Rican time. Outgoing President Calderon presided over the 
ceremony personally. Former presidents and vice presidents of 
Costa Rica and diplomats from various countries, nearly 100 in 
all, were present. [passage omitted] 
  After accepting the medal, President Li expressed his 
appreciation. 
  [Begin Li recording] Confering this honorable [word 
indistinct] cross medal of state on me is not merely an honor 
for myself. It is also a symbol of the noble and sincere 
friendship between our two nations. I am deeply touched. The 
ROC Government and people treasure the noble friendship of your 
government and people. I would like to avail myself of the 
opportunity presented by the changeover of administrations to 
pledge continued efforts by the ROC Government in enhancing 
cooperation with the incoming administration. [end recording] 
  After the ceremony, President Li accepted congratulations 
from the distinguished guests. Afterward, President Calderon 
hosted a banquet in the presidential house in honor of President 
and Mrs Li, the ROC delegation, and distinguished guests from 
various countries.

  [Text] San Salvador, 8 May (NOTIMEX) -- The clandestine 
Salvadoran Revolutionary Front (FRS), a group formed by former 
rebels, today denied that they had made death threats against 
several former rebel commanders and has blamed the "death 
squads" for them. 
  In a communique addressed to NOTIMEX, the FRS said that "at 
no time has the FRS issued a communique with death threats 
against Joaquin Villalobos, Ana Guadalupe Martinez, Eduardo 
Sancho, and others." The communique adds: "We hold the death 
squads, financed by big capital and led by Armando Calderon Sol 
(president-elect), responsible for any attack against members of 
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN)." 
Washington linked Calderon Sol, winner of the runoff elections 
held on 24 April, to the "death squads" in documents that were 
disclosed in November 1993, even though the politician has 
rejected this. 
  Another communique, allegedly issued by the FRS on Thursday, 
threatened applying the "death penalty" to Villalobos, 
Martinez, Sancho, "and other traitors" for the support that 
Martinez and Sancho gave to the rightist Nationalist Republican 
Alliance (ARENA) during the first session of the parliament held 
on 1 May. During the session, Martinez and Sancho, members of 
the Peoples Revitalizing Expression (ERP) and the National 
Resistance (RN), respectively, and five other deputies, also 
members of those organizations, voted in favor of Gloria 
Salguero Gross for the Legislative Assembly Presidency. In 
exchange, the 39 ARENA deputies supported the nomination of 
Martinez and Sancho to the offices of vice president and 
secretary, respectively. 
  In 1981, the two organizations, together with the Farabundo 
Marti Peoples Liberation Front (FPL), the Revolutionary Party of 
Central American Workers (PRTC), and the Communist Party of El 
Salvador, formed the FMLN, now an opposition political party. 
  The communique received by NOTIMEX has the FRS logo, whereas 
the first communique received does not. The FRS logo is a star 
under which read the slogans "Farabundo Marti lives in the 
struggles of the people" and "The weapons shall not be silent 
while injustices prevail in our country." 
  The communique accuses rightist ideologue Kirio Waldo 
Salgado 
of using the acronym of the clandestine group, which was formed 
in January 1993, and "taking advantage of the ideological 
differences within the FRS." The communique reiterates: "We 
warn the extreme right to refrain from using our acronym. 
Otherwise, we will take measures and begin to sabotage the 
economy." The communique adds: "We wish to state to the ERP and 
RN comrades that the FRS is a disciplined political and military 
front and only obeys the orders of its general command." 
  NOTIMEX received a telephone call from an unidentified woman 
who said: "The day we do this (make threats or carry out 
attacks) we will make it very clear." Asked about the 
communique in which the threats are made, the unidentified woman 
said that it was drafted by the "extreme right." 
  When Villalobos and Sancho learned of the death threats made 
against them by the FRS last week, they said that there was a 
possibility this was a maneuver by the extreme right. The FRS 
is made up of former FMLN rebels who disagreed with the signing 
of the peace agreements with the government in 1992. 
  NOTIMEX learned recently that armed groups operate in the 
northern area of El Salvador, as well as in the eastern sector 
of the country.

  [Text] Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez said last 
night at the headquarters of the Guatemalan Air Force: When I 
speak of a cease-fire, which hopefully will be definite in all 
areas where guerrillas are present, how joyful this would be, 
because I believe all of Guatemalan society and even 
international opinion would be satisfied, even though the URNG 
[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] does not have the 
resolve to carry it out. 
  Enriquez added: "I have never asked for a definitive 
cease-fire in all areas where there is a guerrilla presence. I 
have spoken exclusively of the areas between Ixcan and Xabal 
Rivers, Quiche Department, where the refugees are returning and 
where the CPR [Communities of Resistant People] are displaced. " 
  "If they (URNG) defend these people and want those who 
complain the Army has them surrounded to live in peace, they 
will, hopefully, show their political resolve with a cease-fire 
in all of the Ixcan area, because this would help the people 
join civilian life," Enriquez said.

  [Text] Colonel Morris Eugenio de Leon, chief of the 
Information and Press Department of the Army (DIDE), says the 
Armed Forces are preparing for a postwar era and for a revision 
of goals, according to a strategic modernization and 
reorganization plan. 
  The Armed Forces will no longer devote their time solely to 
wiping out guerrillas. Now, they will also participate in 
social activities. According to De Leon, a close look at the 
situation shows that individual rights must be respected. 
  An example of the Army's new duties is its decision to 
cooperate with the arrival of 521 refugee families from Mexico. 
As of 13 May, the Guatemalan Air Force will begin making 18 
flights in Araba airplanes to transport the belongings of the 
refugees, who will be returning to Mayalan, Quiche, where they 
will attempt to live despite the continuing presence of 
guerrillas in the area. 
  The return of the refugees, De Leon added, is part of the 
aforementioned program, the deadline for which is the year 2003. 
The plan does not include a reduction in the Armed Forces High 
Command because its goal is to control future military 
promotions to prevent saturation.

<F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Central American presidents agreed to present a 
common front at the upcoming Ibero-American summit to be held 
13-14 June in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. This was stated on 
Monday by Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro upon her return 
from Costa Rica where she attended President Jose Maria 
Figueres' inauguration. 
  The five Central American presidents, taking advantage of 
their presence in San Jose, held a mini-summit in which they 
also agreed to continue with the integration process. President 
Chamorro also highlighted the importance of consolidating 
democracy in our countries and she said that Costa Rica is an 
example of democracy in the world. To consolidate democracy, 
President Chamorro stressed, peace and understanding must be 
achieved by all Nicaraguans. Farmers must be able to plant their 
crops, she said. Chamorro added that an army and a police force 
are necessary to protect citizens. 
  When questioned on an ultimatum issued by the U.S. 
Government 
to Nicaragua to solve the property problem, President Chamorro 
said: I do not think it is an ultimatum, rather I believe it is 
a cutback in aid to all nations so that the U.S. can asses their 
respective situations. She added that she does not accept 
pressures from any government, but she acknowledged that the 
property problem must be resolved. For this, however, 
cooperation is needed from citizens occupying homes that do not 
belong to them, she noted.

<F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>
  [Text] Preliminary Electoral Tribunal [TE] election returns 
indicate that, so far, there are no clear winners in 12 of the 
71 Legislative Assembly seats that were up for grabs in the 8 
May elections. So far, the opposition United People Alliance 
has won 24 seats and the official Democratic Alliance has won 19. 
  According to preliminary returns, Democratic Revolutionary 
Party [PRD] candidates have won 21 seats in the legislature, 
while its allies, the Liberal Republican Party and Labor Party, 
won two seats and one seat, respectively. Another 12 seats are 
still being disputed, 11 of them between PRD and Arnulfist Party 
[PA] candidates. 
  With 68 percent of the votes counted -- some 733,885 valid 
votes -- the PA has won 12 seats; the Liberal Party has won 
three; the Authentic Liberal Party has won three; and the 
Independent Democratic Union [UDI] has won one. 
  The Change '94 coalition, which supported the candidacy of 
former Comptroller General Ruben Carles, has won 8 legislative 
seats -- five by Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement 
(Molirena) candidates and three by candidates from the Civic 
Renewal Party. 
  The legislative elections also resulted in the surprising 
defeat of the National Renewal Movement, which, despite its 
costly advertising campaign, failed to win a single seat. TE 
projections show that even Marco Ameglio, former president of 
the parliament, failed to get reelected. 
  The Christian Democratic Party was dealt the harshest blow 
during the elections, winning only one legislative seat, thereby 
losing the relative majority obtained in the 1989 elections with 
28 legislators. Ruben Blades' Papa Egoro Movement [MPE] won six 
seats, and the Solidarity Party [PS] won one seat. 
  TE President Eduardo Valdes said projections show the PRD 
could win 11 more seats and the PA could win one. "From that 
total, 11 seats might go to the PRD and one to the PA," Valdes 
indicated. He stated, however, that the Molirena, UDI, PS, or 
the MPE might win one of the 11 seats that are virtually in the 
hands of the PRD.

<F P=106> [Report by Luis Alberto Jimenez] </F>
  [Text] A few minutes ago, the virtual winner of the 8 May 
elections, Ernesto Perez Balladares, left the home of Mrs. 
Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. They gave statements to the press. 
They said the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] had offered 
the Arnulfist Party two ministries. Dr. Perez Balladares also 
said that there are no partisan positions [espacios politicos] 
in his government. He also thanked Mrs. Mireya Moscoso de 
Gruber for welcoming him to her home. 
  [Begin recording] [Moscoso de Gruber] Dr. Perez Balladares 
visited me this morning to discuss certain matters. One of the 
offers he made was that of one or two ministries in his 
government. I have told him that I am not the one to decide and 
that the party's National Executive Committee [CEN] must be 
approached with this offer, and whatever the party decides is 
what will be done. I am not the one who decides. 
  [Jimenez] What ministries could these be? 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] He only offered two ministries; I do not 
know which ministries. But the party has to decide. 
  [Jimenez] If the Arnulfist Party declares itself in 
opposition, then would it not be lacking in political principles 
if it becomes part of the government? 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] After 1 September, my party will 
definitely be in opposition. The decision must be made by the 
party's CEN. I am the president of the party. I do like to 
preside over the meetings in a democratic manner, however, and 
let the CEN decide. Therefore, we must wait. This must be 
presented at a meeting to see what happens. 
  [Jimenez] Sousa Lennox has been mentioned as someone to fill 
a ministerial post. Is he a member of the Arnulfist Party? 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] Yes he is. If any member of the 
Arnulfist Party makes a decision without previously consulting 
with the party, that decision will be declared unauthorized by 
the party. 
  [Jimenez] Would you accept participation in a PRD 
government? 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] No, I would not. 
  [Jimenez] What about other party members? 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] That would have to be discussed by the 
CEN. [end recording] 
  These were statements made by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber upon 
meeting with Perez Balladares at her home. Also in attendance 
at the meeting were Immigration Director Antonio Dominguez and 
Government and Justice Minister Jacobo Salas. According to 
statements by Dr. Perez Balladares, the meeting was cordial. He 
said they talked about the country's future and not the future 
of the political parties, in this case the Arnulfist Party and 
the PRD. Dr. Perez Balladares announced he will be visiting 
other candidates who ran against him in the 8 May elections in 
an attempt to create a consensus government.

  [Text] Businessman Gabriel Lewis Galindo confirmed to RPC 
Television this afternoon that he has accepted Ernesto Perez 
Balladares' offer to hold the post of foreign minister beginning 
on 1 September. Gabriel Lewis Galindo was Panamanian ambassador 
to Washington in the last months of negotiations on the canal 
treaties and during the entire process of the ratification of 
the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. His actions were crucial to the 
ratification of the treaties. The Panamanian industrialist's 
business relations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, as well as 
his diplomatic maneuvering ability, will be exploited by the 
Perez Balladares administration in its efforts to strengthen 
diplomatic and trade ties with all countries. 
  Lewis Galindo's acceptance of the Foreign Ministry post is 
the first confirmation of the formation of the multiparty 
cabinet promised by Dr. Perez Balladares during his presidential 
campaign.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino said yesterday 
that as soon as his work in the current government is completed, 
he will join the political opposition of his country to monitor, 
together with the group led by Ruben Dario Carles, the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD]. 
  Mulino said that he, as a private citizen, supported the 
political option Carles represented during these elections, 
because he believes it was the best, and he said he respects the 
people's decision and accepts defeat. 
  Mulino said: "I am one of Carles' friends. We accept 
defeat, but we will continue our struggle and political 
militancy to monitor the PRD." 
  Mulino formed part of the civic groups that struggled 
against 
militarism without being part of any party, although now he 
announced "he will become a member of one very soon," but he did 
not specify of which party. 
  Mulino said he will conclude his work at the Foreign 
Ministry 
on 1 September, when he will then become a part of his country's 
opposition. 
  Mulino praised President Guillermo Endara, saying he made 
possible free and honest elections that will go down in history 
as an example for future generations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Perez Balladares and National Consensus"] </F>
  [Text] The civic example of absolute harmony demonstrated 
by the Panamanian people last Sunday, the unusually positive 
position assumed by the national government of Guillermo Endara 
Galimany, and the clean elections sponsored by the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal make it compelling for the new president of 
the Republic, Ernesto Perez Balladares, who was elected on that 
date, to strive for a national consensus, as an historic 
response to the popular referendum mentioned above. The 
Panamanians' selecting him to head the destiny of the nation for 
the next five years demonstrates unequivocally their great 
confidence in his levelheadedness and intelligence and his 
ability to carry out such a complex task, much desired by the 
citizens. Last Sunday's events and the entire electoral 
process, in which not a single incident occurred to mar or 
create a lack of confidence in the pureness of the elections, 
demands of the winning candidate -- in this case Perez 
Balladares -- a supremely lofty attitude, above all resentments 
or wounds that might have resulted from the civic confrontation 
that just ended. Now, only the official proclamation by the 
National Electoral Board is pending. 
  We understand perfectly well the traditional political and 
moral commitments acquired in the Panamanian elections. We know 
about the political positions that are distributed among the 
parties and alliances that offer their support for the victory 
of a person who at a given moment reaches the presidency. We 
believe that it is an act of justice to govern with friends and 
with political supporters. Perez Balladares, however, who 
unofficially is Panama's president- elect in view of the results 
of last Sunday's elections, has thus taken on one of the most 
significant commitments in the country. He has ceased to be an 
alliance candidate and has become -- as he himself promised -- 
the president of all Panamanians. The emotion of victory must 
not blind those who were favored by the electors. Having lost 
must not become a reason for bitterness on the part of those who 
did not obtain the people's support. The new president must 
face significant challenges. First, he must face a wealthy 
opposition, which can only be neutralized through a national 
consensus that will offer participation in the administrative 
handling of state affairs to the best men. This situation must 
be understood by his own party members. It must be recognized 
that the organization demonstrated by the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party in last Sunday's elections shows it has 
capable men who could also form part of a government team, 
seeking to achieve the purposes outlined in the program 
announced so many times by the new president. 
  He pledged to the Panamanian people that he would govern 
without hate or rancor. The bitter taste of the political 
confrontations must be buried in the past. The experience of 
revenge, which diverted the current government and which totally 
disrupted efforts at national reconciliation, must serve as a 
lesson to the new president. There is a given fact. To strive 
for this national consensus requires the consent of both 
political groups that were opponents in the bid to secure the 
support of the people, as well as those distinguished citizens 
whose participation will be sought. Thus far, the composition of 
the Legislative Assembly, which must begin holding sessions on 1 
September, is not known. It is important that the president, no 
matter who or what party is involved, have the necessary 
capability to achieve harmony and respect their autonomy. This 
is the only way to promote and achieve the social reality of the 
programs that must be carried out by the Executive Branch. 
Perez Balladares must also realize the other challenge placed 
in his hands by the Panamanian people: implementation of the 
most important stages of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. The 
people are aware that nobody would be better suited than a 
student of General Omar Torrijos to implement a contractual 
agreement that emerges from the very heart of the country. 
  There will be many other challenges that can only be 
implemented through national consensus. The nation needs a 
president who will be of all Panamanians, who will assume a 
genuine leadership, and who will be aware of the historic moment 
that he must cope with. We always have had trust in Perez 
Balladares' promises. Those who got on yesterday's horse to 
spur it and break it did not succeed. With his good sense, his 
levelheadedness, and above all, his absolute certainty that he 
was acting in the best manner, he was able to secure the support 
of the Panamanian people in the purest elections in our history. 
The country's political circumstances are different now. Our 
democracy has been strengthened. We dare say that the virtual 
president, Perez Balladares, will not let the Panamanian people 
down and that his fundamental objectives will be to respect 
liberty, free enterprise, workers' achievements, and democracy. 
For this, he will have to count on the support of all citizens, 
regardless of their color, social or economic position, or party 
persuasion.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibeth Vega G.] </F>
  [Text] Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter yesterday 
confirmed U.S. President Bill Clinton's plans to nominate Robert 
Pastor as the new U.S. ambassador to Panama. Carter said that 
he had met with President Clinton last week and that the 
President told him that he plans to nominate, to the Panamanian 
Government and the U.S. Senate, Pastor as the new U.S. 
ambassador to Panama. 
  Civilist sectors in Panama are against Pastor's appointment 
as the new ambassador. They claim the statesman associated with 
the U.S. Democratic Party maintained close ties with the former 
Panamanian military regime that was overthrown by the U.S. 
invasion on 20 December 1989. 
  Carter added that when he met with President Guillermo 
Endara 
last week Endara said he was pleased by Pastor's nomination. 
  If President Clinton's proposal is confirmed, Pastor will 
occupy the post of U.S. ambassador in Panama left vacant by 
former Ambassador Deane Hinton in February.

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega; from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino has 
said the placet for the new U.S. ambassador to Panama will be 
issued this week. 
  The foreign minister has said the advancement of diplomatic 
relations with the United States is vital for the transition 
period that will lead to the handing over of the Panama Canal 
during the year 2000. 
  Mulino has said the placet will be given to the U.S. 
ambassador to Panama who will replace Deane Hinton, most likely 
Robert Pastor. 
  [Begin recording] [Mulino] I think it is most important to 
maintain close relations with the United States during the 
coming five-year period. I think President-elect Perez 
Balladares will need that. This is a fundamental task. Once 
they assume the government, they will see the task involving the 
canal issue is huge and requires much tending; because of this, 
President Endara and I will evaluate this appointment on 12 May. 
  [Ortega] How is the transition for the Foreign Ministry to 
the next government progressing? 
  [Mulino] Yesterday, I personally called my successor, my 
great and good friend Gabriel Lewis Galindo, who has confirmed 
to me he will be the next foreign minister, to put my working 
team, our experience, and our cooperation at his disposal so 
that when he takes over the Foreign Ministry on 2 September he 
may routinely go to work ignoring nothing about the 
international negotiations we are conducting or the integration 
processes in which we are engaged with Colombia and Central 
America. 
  I will also give him certain recommendations, in writing, on 
the canal issue and on the modernization the Foreign Ministry 
requires, modernization we have been unable to make due to 
economic limitations. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Francisco Gomez and Lorenzo Garibay] </F>
  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 8 May -- Given its 
geographic location, its almost 40 km of common border with the 
United States' richest state, and its economic potential, this 
city has been one of the areas most contested by drug gangs and 
cartels operating in Mexico. This is particularly true of the 
those led by the Arellano Felix brothers and by Hector Palma 
Salazar, alias El Guero Palma. 
  The war among drug trafficking mafias has left behind a wake 
of death and violence. In the past two years, more than 50 
"executions" have taken place involving the death of people 
linked to these two gangs that are vying for control of this 
area, which is strategic for drug trafficking. 
  Tijuana, which is a natural stepping stone to the world's 
largest drug consuming market, has been known for its large 
numbers of drug seizures. In the past 16 months in this area, 
approximately 65,500 kg of marijuana and 16,316 kg of cocaine as 
well as 10 kg of heroin have been seized, demonstrating that 
this is a place favored by drug traffickers, according to the 
Attorney General's Office. 
  The streets in this city have been the scene of drug 
trafficking gang rivalries and of police complicity with these 
gangs as well as an increase in drug abuse among the community, 
particularly among youths. 
  So far this year, five deaths have been attributed to the 
drug trafficking groups. Of these deaths, the murder of 
Alejandro Castaneda Andre, commander of the special group of the 
Judicial Federal Police [PFJ], and the 28 April murder of 
Federico Benitez Lopez, director of Municipal Public Security 
and of his driver Ramon Alerid Cardenas, stand out. In this 
last case, no one has been arrested, and there are no leads. In 
the Castaneda Andrade case, however, a state judicial police 
officer, who was in the company of a group of drug traffickers, 
and a "godmother" were arrested. Nevertheless, what is most 
remarkable is that legal action was taken against Sergio Ortiz 
Lara, the state's deputy prosecutor, for helping in the escape 
of members of the Arellano Felix gangs. 
  According to an investigation conducted by the National Poll 
on drug use in Baja California and Tijuana, in particular, the 
community is becoming a large consumer market, particularly for 
drugs such as cocaine and crack. The study results indicate that 
the majority of the youths polled in junior high and high 
schools started abusing drugs before they were 15. 
  The drug cartels' struggle to impose their control on this 
area has given way to the so-called "executions," which, in the 
last 24 months, have taken as victims a state judicial police 
agent; Wenceslao Berinstain Avila, a former Attorney General's 
Office agent; Pedro Rodriguez Moreno, a customs agent; Israel 
Alvarado Acosta and an associate; and Jose Luis Stavinsky, son 
of a well-know Tijuana businessman, in addition to many other 
victims. The majority of these cases remain unpunished. 
  The drug cartels' struggle for this city and other important 
sites for drug trafficking activities came out in the open a 
year ago in Guadalajara, Jalisco, when Cardinal Juan Jesus 
Posada Ocampo and six other individuals were murdered. The 
incident took place during a confrontation at the Guadalajara 
airport among groups led by the Arellano Felix brothers; Joaquin 
Guzman Loera, alias El Chapo Guzman; and El Guero Palma. 
Previously a confrontation had taken place between them at the 
disco Christine de Puerto Vallarta. 
  The Arellano Felix brothers, Ramon, Benjamin, and Javier, 
are the ones who have controlled this activity in Tijuana in the 
past few years, after they inherited control from their uncle 
Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo. Felix Gallardo during his time and 
up until his incarceration at the high security penitentiary in 
Almoloya, Juarez, was considered the capo of Mexico's largest 
drug trafficking ring. 
  Arellano Felix's power and influence became obvious when 35 
safe houses, a farm, and an industrial factory were seized. An 
unfinished tunnel was uncovered in the factory. This tunnel was 
to connect Tijuana with San Diego to smuggle drugs into the 
United States. 
  Recently the PGR sold off properties belonging to this gang 
consisting of 12 furniture lots, stuffed animals, vintage wines, 
paintings and sculptures of well-known artists, and other 
ostentatious articles. The starting bidding price was 134,642 
pesos. Two days before, 11 homes that had been seized were put 
on public auction, however, only one was sold, the price of 
which is unknown. The company in charge of carrying out this 
operation was Avaluos Integrales S.A. de CV, contracted by the 
PGR itself. 
  Up until now, the Arrellano Felix brothers remain at large 
with the exception of Francisco Javier Arellano Felix, who was 
arrested by the PJF in Tijuana in December. He was transferred 
to the Almoloya high security jail in Juarez where his staunch 
rival, Joaquin Guzman, alias El Chapo Guzman, has been since 
June. El Chapo Guzman was arrested in Guatemala and turned over 
to the Mexican authorities. 
  The last time any news was heard about the Arellano Felix 
gang was on 3 March during the shoot out in which Alexandro 
Castaneda Andrade, commander of the special group of the PFJ in 
that city, was killed. Andrade had located the site where 
Javier Arellano Felix, alias El Tigrillo, and his lieutenant 
Ismael Higuera Guerrero, alias El Mayel, were hiding. He was 
killed, however, during the confrontation when he attempted to 
arrest them. The case still has not been totally cleared up, 
but, according to versions of the PRG itself, El Tigrillo and El 
Mayel had already been arrested but were released by state 
police agents, allegedly by deputy prosecutor Sergio Ortiz Lara 
himself. Ortiz Lara is currently under arrest for his alleged 
responsibility in this case. 
  The most recent victim here of the drug trafficking groups 
was Federico Benitez Lopez, director of Municipal Security 
Police, and his driver Alarid Cardenas, who were murdered 10 
days ago on the highway in La Mesa. Benitez Lopez became known 
for confiscating weapons and marijuana in that city. 
  Benitez Lopez held that post for five months, when the drug 
trafficking phenomena was to be attacked in a joint action on 
three government levels. Nevertheless, the plans failed due to 
the rivalries among the different police corps and the 
corruption spread by the distribution of dollars by organized 
crime. 
  The large drug cargoes that reach this border have resulted 
in a peculiar phenomena: San Diego California drug addicts come 
to exchange weapons for drugs. This was reported by David Rubi, 
chief of the Tactic Group, who affirmed that weekly a weapon 
known as a goat's horn [cuerno de chivo] is found in the hands 
of gang members in this city's poor neighborhoods.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 10 May. 
  The Mexican mining industry has suffered a 12 percent drop 
in 
production over the past four years, according to the Trade 
Union of Miners. The union also reported that 30,000 workers 
have been laid off during this period. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 4 May 94) 
  The price of domestic raw materials rose 3.1 percent in the 
first quarter of 1994, according to an EL FINANCIERO study based 
on figures from the Bank of Mexico. The newspaper's analysts 
point out that this rate of inflation was below the inflation 
rate recorded by raw materials on the international market, 
which rose 8.6 percent in the same period. Nevertheless, the 
study points out that in 1990-93, Mexican consumer prices rose 
annually at 26.7, 22.7, 15.5, and 9.8 percent, while domestic 
raw materials rose only 23.6, 8.3, 5.7, and 1.7 percent, 
respectively. The difference lies in the price of imported 
materials, which are usually higher. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO 
in Spanish 5 May 94 p 3A) 
  Higher inflation and less economic growth are now the 
government's projections for 1994. Following the murder of 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and the events 
surrounding the investigation and the election process, the 
government has adjusted the targets in its economic plan. Now, 
inflation is expected to reach 7-8 percent, and GNP growth has 
been revised downward and is expected to range between 1.5 and 2 
percent. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 5 May 94 p 24) 
  Unemployment in the 37 largest metropolitan areas rose to 
3.8 
percent in January, the highest January figure since 1992 and 
the third highest within the past 24 months. The National 
Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Information (INEGI) 
reported that 1.286 million people are out of work. Some 
180,000 of these people are teens and young adults with no 
previous job experience, who were forced into the labor market 
and have not yet found work. INEGI monitors this figure on a 
weekly basis. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 5 May 94 pp 
60, 48) 
  An EL FINANCIERO study based on INEGI statistics indicates 
that the number of new jobs offered during the first quarter of 
1994 showed a negligible increase of 0.1 percent. Only 11,000 
new jobs were made available, which means that the government 
will reach its goal of 500,000 new jobs a year over a four-year 
period. The report concludes by saying the private sector has 
reported layoffs and closures in most major areas of production, 
which in turn makes it poor source of new jobs. (Mexico City EL 
FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 May 94 p 3A) 
  The Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce 
(Concanaco) has reported that the private sector's contribution 
to the nation's GNP dropped 1.2 percent in 1993. This is the 
largest fall since 1986. According to a Concanaco study, this 
had a negative effect on jobs and sales. The report projects, 
however, that there will be some recovery during the first 
quarter of 1994, although this recovery will be modest. (Mexico 
City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 May 94 p 28) 
  The Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic 
Resources (SARH) has reported that the agricultural trade 
deficit declined 84 percent in 1993 from the previous year. 
SARH noted that the 1992 trade deficit topped $761.47 million, 
while in 1993 the deficit reached $121.45 million. The report 
added that Mexico basically continues to sell raw coffee, fresh 
vegetables, and fruit, except for cantaloupe and watermelon, and 
is still purchasing soybeans, sorghum, and wheat. (Mexico City 
LA JORNADA in Spanish 6 May 94 p 57) 
  It has been reported that 68 of the 213 nonfinancial 
business 
enterprises on the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) registered net 
losses during the first three months of 1994. On the other 
hand, 79 consortiums reported their profits dropped by 23.2 
percent, while 66 enterprises registered increases. (Mexico 
City LA JORNADA in Spanish 6 May 94 pp 72, 58) 
  The depreciation of the peso and the increase in interest 
rates, particularly 28-day Treasury Notes, have prompted 
financial middlemen to record losses in their net earnings in 
the first three months of the year. At least eight trading 
companies reported losses, 10 percent of the customers from 154 
investment societies withdrew, and more than eight banks 
reported heavy losses. In addition, 60 companies in the BMV 
registered exchange losses worth more than 4.352 billion new 
pesos. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 9 May 94 p 6) 
  In view of the increasing debts of corporations and 
individuals, less financing from national banks, and the 
uncertainty prevailing in the economy with regard to the lack of 
growth, consumer prices continued to drop in the first three 
months of the year. According to reports from 17 businesses 
working with the BMV, their net sales amounted to 12.343 billion 
new pesos from January to March 1994. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO 
in Spanish 9 May 94 p 3A) 
  The federal and state governments have invested 
approximately 
179 million new pesos in Chiapas State to be used in emergency 
programs in the areas of electrification, potable water works, 
and productive programs. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 9 
May 94 p 3) 
  Juan Ramon Jimenez, an economist from the Technological 
Institute of Monterrey who is conducting a study on the 
concentration of wealth, has concluded that 60 percent of the 
revenue generated in the country is being earned by 10 percent 
of the population, while 10 percent of the overall annual income 
is being distributed among 60 percent of the population. 
Jimenez says this "gap between the rich and poor" is the result 
of the fact the Mexican economy is highly monopolized. For 
example, the value of the shares owned by eight companies in the 
BMV is equivalent to one-fourth of the GDP. (Mexico City LA 
JORNADA in Spanish 9 May 94 p 48) 
  On 9 May, the Bank of Mexico reported that Mexico registered 
an inflation rate of 0.5 percent during April, and that the 
annual inflation rate so far this year amounts to 2.31 percent, 
which is lower than the inflation rate for the same period in 
1993, which amounted to 3.27 percent. (Paris AFP in Spanish 
0045 GMT 10 May 94) 
  Given the weakness in the world fuel market, which has been 
generated by an excessive supply of petroleum products and the 
fall in international prices, Mexican petroleum exports declined 
at an annual rate of 16.6 percent in the first two months of 
1994. Overseas sales of crude, its by-products, and 
petrochemical products totaled $986.6 million in the first two 
months of the year. This represents 19.5 percent of the 
nation's total exports, without taking into account assembly 
plant exports in this same period. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in 
Spanish 2 May 94 p 3A) 
  During the first two months of the year, Mexican public 
sector exports, without taking into account assembly plants, 
only grew 11.9 percent over the same period last year when they 
registered a growth rate of 21.5 percent. Nevertheless, the 
exports by the Mexican private sector in this same period grew 
21.5 percent. Sales to various international markets totaled 
$5.58 billion, of which $3.70 billion was for semi-finished 
goods, $1.502 billion for consumer goods, and $484.8 million for 
capital goods. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 May 94 p 
21) 
  A Bank of Mexico report indicates that the nation's current 
accounts deficit has grown more than 700 percent during this 
administration. According to the report, the trade exchange of 
merchandise was one of the factors that influenced the increase 
the most, with imports outpacing exports. The current accounts 
balance in tourism registered a $605.2 million surplus, while 
revenues from travelers totalled $6.167 billion. (Mexico City 
UNOMASUNO in Spanish 3 May 94 p 16) 
  Factors affecting administration, customs, handling, and 
dredging work, as well as the increase in maritime traffic in 
local waters and a lack of infrastructure for port facilities, 
have resulted in a decrease in services to foreign trade since 
the implementation of NAFTA. Moreover, extended delays for 
ships in Mexican ports have created huge increases in operating 
costs, which are estimated to run as much as $5,000 a day for a 
ship in port. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 May 94 p 
24) 
  A Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development study 
indicates that Mexican sales to the United States increased 22.6 
percent over the first two months of the year "as a result of 
the implementation of NAFTA." The study also notes that the 
Mexican farming sector has a dynamic role in exports to the 
United States in terms of peeled citrus, dried melons, prepared 
potatoes, prepared tomatoes, dehydrated onions, nuts, canned 
vegetables and fruits, melons, watermelons, papayas, and 
sunflower seeds. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 May 94

specialist Lorenzo] 
  [Text] The train of Mexico's comprehensive modernization 
has already left the station where Carlos Salinas and his 
neoliberals were. They did not board it because they were very 
busy with the macroeconomic reform. It is obvious today, 
however, that they made a mistake because the train was carrying 
the political foundations of stability for the new economy. If 
the Salinas group (well, what is left of it) starts running 
after it, they still just might be able to clamber onto the 
caboose. It would not be a very elegant maneuver, but as we 
shall see, the alternative is worse. 
  As things now stand, the Salinas group's main problem is 
credibility. How are we to define political credibility? A not 
particularly scientific, yet accurate definition would be as 
follows: credibility is something that the Mexican Government 
currently lacks but that it cannot do without or substitute for 
in order to effectively exercise authority in times of crisis. 
  Credibility is nothing more than a predisposition to believe 
someone or something in spite of inadequate objective evidence. 
In the specific case of a government's credibility, it 
represents the degree to which citizens (or at least a majority 
of them) are satisfied with the deeds, explanations, promises, 
and character of the authorities. 
  To say that the Mexican Government suffers from a growing 
lack of credibility is neither new nor unfounded. Let us look at 
a current example. Mori de Mexico, the polling firm run by 
Miguel Basanez, posed the following question to 312 persons whom 
it interviewed over the telephone in five major cities between 8 
and 10 April: "Do you think that the people who are really to 
blame for Colosio's assassination will ever be found?" 
Forty-three percent said no; 34 percent said they did not know, 
and just 23 percent said yes. So, just slightly more than two of 
every 10 respondents showed complete confidence in the 
government regarding something as important as solving the 
murder of the state party's presidential candidate while he was 
being guarded by the Presidential Staff. 
  As for the official investigation into the assassination of 
Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo last year in Guadalajara, the 
bishop of Cuernavaca, Luis Reynoso, speaking at the Conference 
of Mexican Bishops, declared: "We (bishops) are not satisfied 
but we do hope to learn more." I do not think that I am 
exaggerating if I say that many of us Mexicans feel worse than 
the bishops: dissatisfied with the investigations into the 
assassinations of Colosio, Posadas, and many others (Buendia, 
Ovando, the Ocosingo five, the "Morelia" ejido three, etc.) and 
without much hope of seeing these cases solved. 
  Trust in the authorities is an indispensable, irreplaceable 
element of a good government. True, a government can, in 
principle, compel obedience to its authority by sheer force, but 
in the long run, force or fear has never been the foundation of 
good government. And although the threat of force to compel 
obedience underlies every form of government, the modern 
exercise of authority ought to be based on persuasion, not 
coercion. 
  Ideally, political authority ought to be synonymous with 
"legitimate power," and obedience ought to be the upshot of such 
legitimacy. But legitimacy is not possible without credibility. 
Therefore, it is urgent to restore the credibility of the 
governmental structure in our country. Only a massive infusion 
of trust in government action will enable the country to cope 
successfully with the complex and dangerous dynamics already 
unleashed by the major political event that is hurtling towards 
us: the 21 August elections. 
  According to the previously mentioned Mori poll, the gap 
between the presidential candidates of the State party (PRI) and 
the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] is barely 10 
percent, which is just about how far the PRD candidate is in 
front of the PAN [National Action Party] standard-bearer. 
Moreover, one-quarter of the respondents declined to voice a 
preference. So, the actual outcome of the election is going to 
depend on them, in other words, the people who are not sure or 
do not wish to say for whom they are going to vote. One can, of 
course, argue about how representative and statistically 
reliable the Mori survey is (90 percent), but there can no 
longer be any doubt that the upcoming election will be genuinely 
competitive. 
  After ludicrous, shameful experiences like the unopposed 
candidacy of Jose Lopez-Portillo, the fact that electoral 
competition is finally taking root in Mexico is very 
encouraging. Institutionalizing such competition is the only 
path to a truly democratic political system because only then 
will the electorate have real choices in terms of leaders and 
programs. Nonetheless, darkening what should be a bright horizon 
is the fact that in 1994 this competition is going to take place 
amid civic skepticism. 
  True electoral competition against a backdrop of mounting 
mistrust, marked by doubts about the impartiality of the 
government during the campaign and, above all, about the 
accuracy of the official returns, is a perfect prescription for 
turning the post-election period into precisely what it ought 
not to be: a conflict that swamps institutional channels, a 
conflict of whose origin we are well aware but of whose outcome 
we are not sure. And an ungovernable country is one of the 
outcomes it may hold for us. 
  PRI's preparations for 21 August and whatever comes 
afterward 
are not at all reassuring. According to a PRI document that the 
newspaper REFORMA (16 April) obtained a copy of, the party 
already has a plan, designed by propaganda experts, to use the 
supposedly neutral authorities for its benefit, among other 
things. Specifically, the plan "envisages the selection of 
groups of officials from political organizations, such as the 
IFE [Federal Electoral Institute], the Interior Secretariat...to 
issue discreet, programmed, and timely statements with the 
message and of the intensity deemed necessary to define and 
control the direction of the debate." Since the problem is 
credibility, not an official victory, PRI already intends to 
proclaim victory on 21 August and to back it up with, among 
other things, the "testimony of polling-place officials, stating 
that they had seen no anomalies." Therefore, the State party is 
alive and kicking. The separation between PRI and the government 
Colosio announced shortly before he was assassinated has not 
taken place; much less is there a determination to hold clean 
elections. 
  PRI is not showing any real willingness to change its 
long-standing policy, the one that says: elections in Mexico are 
useful for a lot of things, except to decide who is to govern. 
And the fact that the famous "Atlacomulco group," headed by 
Carlos Hank Gonzalez, is the one that has has been charged with 
seeing to it that PRI's new candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, wins 
makes it even more unlikely that the outcome of the election 
next August will be credible. The "Atlacomulco group," which is 
monopolizing leadership posts in the Zedillo campaign, does not 
exactly have a reputation as a friend of modern democracy. Quite 
the opposite: it is known for its iron-like determination to 
prolong the authoritarianism that has turned out to be such a 
good deal for many of its members. 
  While Mexican politics was conducted against the backdrop of 
the authoritarian normalcy that was created and bolstered during 
65 years of uninterrupted control by a State party, electoral 
credibility was not a particularly important factor because 
average Mexicans had no choice but to abide by the dictates of 
the government, whether or not they believed or liked it. Until 
1988, we Mexicans had no real political options. The situation 
is different today. Going against the grain and overcoming 
countless obstacles, the options have finally emerged, and 
therefore, the elections are going to be competitive. This time, 
however, the opposition (the Cardenas people in particular) is 
better organized than in 1988, and it will be harder for the 
president and PRI to assure the country's governability if the 
opposition refuses to accept the legality of the election 
results. 
  When trust in the authorities is something more than just 
resignation, credulity, or naivete, it is the result of 
experience, something born of a pattern of conduct by government 
officials towards the governed, whereby they keep their promises 
and make their actions consistent with their words. The Salinas 
group has been credible only in the realm of macroeconomics. 
Hence, Salinas' credibility is strong only among the financial 
elite. 
  As far as the overseas audience is concerned, Salinas' major 
promise was to carry out neoliberal economic change while 
maintaining social order and political stability. Since the 
latter part of the promise has not been kept (Chiapas, Tijuana), 
Salinas' credibility abroad has declined dramatically. One good 
example of this is the recent article by Michael Elliot in the 4 
April issue of NEWSWEEK. According to him, today, Mexico is 
paying the price for having brought about economic change while 
trying to save itself the political cost. Salinas' "fatal 
error," which, according to Elliot, Asian and African leaders 
should take note of, is this: "If a society is granted economic 
freedom, it will also have to be given other freedoms: to elect 
its authorities and to express its desires openly. If this does 
not happen, the supposed economic liberator will be consumed by 
the fire of unfulfilled expectations." 
  At the beginning of this article, I stated that perhaps all 
is not lost as far as credibility is concerned. Indeed, the 
president can still lessen the long-term consequences of his 
"fatal error." For example, he could and should make a dramatic 
gesture to separate his government and his economic reforms from 
the fate of Ernesto Zedillo in particular and PRI in general. He 
could summon the leaders of the authentic opposition (PRD and 
PAN) to a "summit meeting" and at last lay the groundwork for a 
true historic pact. Such a gesture could transform what 
threatens to be a disastrous finale for his six-year term into 
something positive and different: a transition from 
authoritarianism to democracy. 
  What is at stake today is the governability of the country 
after August. Without such governability, the gains that have 
been made in the neoliberal economic agenda run the risk of 
being undone. If that were to happen, there would be neither 
political nor economic modernity, and the losers would not be 
just, as always, the people on the bottom but also the ones on 
top.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 6 May (NA) -- Interim Supreme Court 
President Julio Nazareno, in a surprise move, has resigned. 
Ricardo Levene will temporarily replace him. This move 
threatens to prompt another crisis in the country's top court, 
this time it is closely linked to salary demands by the sector's 
employees. 
  Nazareno's resignation was considered today during a plenum 
in which only six of the court's nine members participated. 
  The justices named Ricardo Levene to replace Nazareno for a 
period of 20 days. Levene held this post until 1993 when Julio 
Boggiano, the previous president of the court, took over. 
  The decision was made known this afternoon. It has been 
decided "to elect a new president on 8 June at 1000." 
  The resignation came just a day after a meeting on 5 May 
between Nazareno, Guillermo Lopez, Carlos Fayt, President Carlos 
Menem, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, and Justice Minister 
Jorge Mairano. 
  The justices demanded a solution to the salary demands of 
judicial branch employees who have been carrying out a long term 
action plan. 
  The executive branch told them the answer must come from the 
sector's budget and that the only alternative would be to freeze 
unfilled vacancies and make available funds pertaining to 
employees that have not yet been named. 
  This alternative was confirmed on 5 May by Maiorano, who 
visited the Supreme Court to participate in a ceremony in which 
the informatics system was inaugurated. 
  The decision to accept Nazareno's resignation was made 
during 
a meeting in which Justices Augusto Belluscio, Santiago 
Petracchi, and Gustavo Bossert did not participate. [passage

  [Excerpts] The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which conducts 
international searches for Nazi criminals, has asked the German 
courts to "reopen the case" involving former German Army Captain 
Erich Priebke -- who was recently discovered in Argentina -- in 
murders committed during World War II. The request to reopen 
the case could lead to his extradition from Argentina. 
Priebke's recent statement to the U.S. TV network ABC, in which 
he admits his involvement in the German invasion of Rome, 
prompted the Simon Wiesenthal Center to file this request. 
  Priebke, who admitted having had a hand in the killing of 
330 
Italians while serving in the SS, was discovered by a team of 
ABC reporters in San Carlos de Bariloche. A Simon Wiesenthal 
Center spokesman for Latin American affairs said Priebke "served 
in the German forces in Italy during World War II and 
participated in the so-called Rome Massacre." On that occasion 
"in response to an attack by Italian partisans, the Germans shot 
over 300 people." Priebke told ABC reporters that he 
participated in the massacre but did so "under orders." [passage 
omitted] 
  It is up to the German courts to file for the extradition of 
the former Nazi. The statement by the war criminal could prompt 
the German courts to reopen the case it will also depend on how 
likely the extradition will be granted. 
  Swastikas -- the well-known symbol of the Third Reich which 
persecuted Jewish people in European countries invaded by 
Germany -- appeared on the walls of stores in Once neighborhood, 
Buenos Aires, on 6 May. This neighborhood, some 30 blocs from 
downtown Buenos Aires, is where a lot of Jewish people live, 
although Asian immigrants like the Chinese, the Taiwanese, and 
the Koreans have also been settling there lately. Swastikas 
were also painted on the walls of two neighborhood synagogues.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 9 May (NA) -- The Italian courts 
today filed an extradition petition with Argentina against 
former Nazi officer Erich Priebke, allegedly involved in the 
killing of more than 300 people during World War II, who was 
discovered in San Carlos de Bariloche last week. 
  Argentine Foreign Vice Minister Fernando Petrella announced 
that the petition filed by the Italian courts will be "discussed 
immediately." Petrella, however, made it clear that the Foreign 
Ministry "only reviews" the petition, while it is the courts 
that actually "thoroughly study the issue." [passage omitted]

reported this morning that the latter will make a deposition 
before the San Carlos de Bariloche federal courts in the next 
few hours. 
  Judge Moldes confirmed that the former Nazi officer was 
arrested at Bariloche Clinic, which is owned by Priebke, 
yesterday evening. He made it clear that "so far no formal

  [Text] (NA-DYN) -- The patents bill currently before the 
Senate is being revamped by the Foreign Ministry and the 
Justicialist Party bloc of senators so as to bring it into line 
with the GATT agreement and to make it similar to intellectual 
property-rights legislation being used in Brazil. 
  At the same time the Senate's Industry commission confirmed 
yesterday that Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo will be giving 
his view on the issue before the Commission on May 19. 
  Foreign Ministry officials said yesterday that the 
government's intention is not to send a new law to Congress -- 
which would take even longer to be passed -- but to reach an 
agreement with the Radical Party on a patents protection law 
that would fall within the framework of the GATT treaty, of 
which Argentina and the US are both signatories. 
  The government's intention is to obtain, at the least, a law 
that is in accordance with GATT terms and at the most, one that 
grants foreign pharmaceutical companies greater protection as 
Mexico did so as to obtain its membership in the NAFTA North 
American free trade agreement. 
  Notwithstanding the GATT treaty, the US has been carrying 
out 
bilateral talks in an effort to obtain even further benefits. 
  The Foreign Ministry is now advising the Party Senators on 
how best to modify the current bill so as to comply with 
international trade regulations as well as to make it as similar 
as possible to Brazil's laws in view of the Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South] southern-cone common market integration. 
  Some of the modifications to be included will be a 
transition 
period, already in the official text but much shorter than the 
10 years contemplated by the GATT treaty. 
  There will also be a monopoly on imports to benefit the 
patent holder, except when it is imported raw materials from 
Mercosur member countries. 
  One of the pending issues which will be heatedly debated in 
Congress is the automatic manufacturing licences being demanded 
by local pharmaceutical companies in order to avoid a monopoly 
situation. 
  If the new patents law meets US pharmaceutical company 
demands half way as well as taking into account GATT rulings and 
domestic company demands, then the law could be acceptable to 
the local pharmaceutical companies Pablo Challu said yesterday. 
  He added however that the patent life should only last for 
ten years, and not the 20 years that is being demanded by US 
pharmaceutical companies. 
  Argentina is being heavily pressed by the US to have a 
patents law in place within the next 60 days, a deadline 
extension that was officially announced last Wednesday by the US 
Embassy.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 May (NA) -- Interior Minister 
Carlos Ruckauf today asserted that if the current government 
wants to win the 1995 presidential elections it must "eliminate 
all pockets of corruption." 
  Ruckauf acknowledged: "Showing our meritorious 
accomplishments will not be enough." The minister said the 
government must not only corruption it must also "clearly state 
how -- while maintaining the present economic policy -- it 
intends to enhance growth and put provincial economies in order 
so that their authorities may maintain the transformations the 
country is undergoing." 
  Ruckauf played down the increased popularity of the Grand 
Front and other opposition parties in the past 10 April 
elections. He remarked that to be a valid alternative "protests 
are insufficient." 
  Ruckauf, talking on the radio, said that in the 10 April 
election, some sectors "thought it was important to protest," 
but things will be different in 1995 "because whenever there is 
an election for the presidency, governorship, or mayoralty, 
voters want to know how they will fare on the market or in life 
in the forthcoming months." 
  He underlined the support the Justicialist Party managed to 
maintain in Greater Buenos Aires noting that "men and women 
living in the most humble areas voted for the plan that wiped 
out hyperinflation and achieved stability" because "they know 
there are more jobs, which is quite noticeable among those who 
work rather than among those who just hang about." 
  Ruckauf added: "Nowhere in the world do people kill the 
goose 
that lays the golden egg, least of all when they have endured 
the economic setbacks Argentina has experienced." The minister 
concluded: "This country has registered the fastest growth in 
the western world over the last three years."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 May (NA) -- Raul Granillo Ocampo, 
the Argentine ambassador to the United States, has admitted that 
bilateral relations are tense over the Pharmaceutical Patents 
Law. 
  Granillo Ocampo pointed out: "Within the framework of good 
relations, Argentina is seeking a solution that considers the 
interests of both parties." 
  The ambassador to the United States, who has come to 
Argentina to lecture to Cordoba and Entre Rios businessmen, 
conceded: "There is pressure but Argentina has signed the GATT 
agreement, which seeks to define standards of economic relations 
and to guarantee fair and free trade between nations." 
  He explained that, by GATT standards, Argentina meets the 
requirements of the international community "at a minimum 
level." He made it clear that "if we want a special association 
with the United States by way of NAFTA, a special efforts will 
be required." 
  Regarding the possibility that Argentina may join NAFTA, 
Granillo Ocampo noted: "It is a multi-party negotiation in which 
we must weigh what we have to give against what we will receive 
in order to see if it is beneficial for us." 
  In an interview published in the daily EL CRONISTA 
COMERCIAL, 
Granillo Ocampo underlined that "if the Pharmaceutical Patents 
Law is enacted, we will have a better chance of joining NAFTA, 
but our incorporation will not be automatic: Nor will we be 
automatically excluded from it if we fail to pass the 
aforementioned law." 
  The Argentine diplomat pointed out: "President Bill Clinton 
is scheduled to submit a definite proposal to Congress on 1 
July. One of the requirements [for joining NAFTA] will be the 
patents law." He made it clear that "no country meets all the 
requirements." 
  To conclude, Granillo Ocampo said: "As in any negotiation, 
when one reaches the end of the line, one looses interest in 
being a party to that agreement."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 May (NA) -- Today, Vice Foreign 
Minister Fernando Petrella warned that Argentina "cannot 
maintain a rigid position" regarding the draft Pharmaceutical 
Patents Law, at least "on the basis of the current situation." 
He made it clear that his evaluation is "entirely personal." 
  Petrella told a radio station that Brazil reached "an 
agreement, which has yet to be formalized, with U.S. authorities 
with an eye to making its position more flexible." He added: 
"This topic must be decided by the incoming Brazilian 
Government." 
  Regarding "concrete points," Petrella warned that "the 
interests of local laboratories must be taken into account as 
they have been operating in accordance with a modus vivendi that 
is permitted by the current law. The interests of the consumer 
have also been considered." He ratified his "confidence" that 
the Argentine Congress "will come up with a law that will 
harmonize all interests." 
  Referring to Argentina not being included on the list of 
nations to be sanctioned, Petrella stressed that the U.S. 
Government "made an important political gesture that reveals its 
good relations and rapport" with Argentina. 
  He said: "This is an important topic, but it is not 
extremely 
important," while emphasizing that "these excellent relations 
must not be impaired, especially at this time when they are 
based on strategic viewpoints that are much more difficult to 
achieve." He added: "These are small steps that Argentina can 
take to attenuate the situation." 
  The vice foreign minister stressed that our country "has a 
well-defined position" regarding the conflict over the 
continental glaciers, adding that "the idea of arbitration" has 
reached Chile. "From what I know and from Argentina's 
viewpoint, there have been no feelers regarding this new 
possibility," Petrella said. 
  Finally, regarding the sending of Argentine Border Police to 
the former Yugoslavia, Petrella said: "There are a number of UN 
demands of which Argentines can be very proud, especially the 
Armed Forces."

<F P=106> [Article by Miguel Angel Rouco] </F>
  [Excerpt] An IMF delegation which will handle the auditing 
of fiscal accounts will arrive in our country tomorrow with the 
goal of persuading the Argentine Government to substantially 
reduce its levels of spending. 
  The delegation, headed by British economist Martin Hardy, 
will almost entirely concentrate on persuading the economic 
leadership to further reduce its spending in order to achieve an 
increased fiscal surplus. The IMF delegates' goal is clear: 
Argentina must reduce its spending by at least 10 percent of 
the 1994 budget allocations. This is equivalent to about 1.5 
percent of the GDP. 
  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has already said 
unofficially that it is impossible, with the current 
administrative structure, to further reduce spending. 
  The economy minister asked his team of assistants to be 
extremely careful and convince the IMF auditors of the fact that 
a budget cut similar to the one implemented in 1993 is not 
viable now because the entire administrative structure would be 
affected. 
  During a meeting with his closest officials, Cavallo 
expressed a worrisome omen: "If we implement the IMF petitions, 
we run the risk of throwing our entire efforts in the field of 
collection, public sector reform, and state streamlining 
overboard. We cannot reduce spending any further now. They 
cannot expect us to cut back on retiree, Comprehensive Medical 
Assistance Plan, and hospital funds." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 10 May (NA) -- Finance Secretary 
Ricardo Gutierrez today denied reports indicating that the IMF 
would ask for a 10 percent cutback in the 1994 budget to be 
implemented. He emphasized that the fiscal surplus targets 
agreed upon for the first quarter "were surpassed." 
  Gutierrez noted that the surplus agreed upon with the IMF 
"totaled $640 million, and this target was surpassed by $60 
million as a $700 million surplus was achieved." 
  The finance secretary also believes that the IMF delegation 
will issue a favorable report on Argentine fiscal accounts. 
  Gutierrez added: "What we have done so far will not 
represent any problem or be deserving of any remarks from the 
IMF." 
  The finance secretary described as "entirely inaccurate" the 
reports on IMF concerns over the first quarter's fiscal results. 
He confirmed that this "is entirely mistaken information." 
  Gutierrez emphasized that "the first quarter's targets were 
surpassed." 
  The finance secretary said the IMF delegation would meet on 
12 or 13 May with the financial team. In addition to Gutierrez, 
the financial team also includes Economic Programming Secretary 
Juan Llach and Public Revenues Secretary Carlos Tacchi. 
  Gutierrez made these remarks after an economic team meeting 
at the Economy Ministry today. [passage omitted]

  [Text] (DYN) -- The balance of trade in the first two 
months this year produced a massive deficit of 1.11 billion 
dollars, an almost ninefold increase over the same period last 
year, the INDEC census bureau reported yesterday. 
  Exports during the period totalled 1.89 billion dollars, a 
4.4 percent increase over the same period last year. Imports 
however grew by 55.2 percent and totalled just over three 
billion dollars. 
  The trade imbalance with the United States shot up by 132.3 
percent while the only surplus of note was achieved in trade 
with the Netherlands (117 million dollars). 
  Although there were small surpluses on trade with individual 
countries, in most cases these didn't exceed 10 million dollars 
as was the case with Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, 
Venezuela, Denmark, Greece, Portugal and China. 
  Trade with the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
southern-cone common market went from a 5.1-million-dollar 
surplus in January-February 1993 to a deficit 152.8 million 
dollars in the same period this year. Trade with NAFTA followed 
the same trend and shot up 135 percent to 638 million dollars. 
  Exports of primary products continued to decline in the 
first 
two months, falling 19.6 percent with respect to the same period 
last year, although exports of value-added agricultural goods 
grew by 7.1 percent and industrial goods by 27.6 percent. 
  Percentage increases in imports by product grouping were 
114.7 for capital goods and 38.6 percent for their spare parts 
and 30.5 percent for consumer goods, almost five times the 
growth rate of the gross domestic product. 
  Capital goods accounted for 40 percent of imports in January 
and 47.4 percent in February while consumer goods accounted for 
18.7 percent of imports in the first month of the year and 15.6 
percent in the second. Imports of semi-processed goods also 
increased by 34.4 percent as did buses, up 37.2 percent and 
fuels up by 178.4 percent. 
  Most of the imported goods, or some 838.2 million dollars 
worth, came from the United States although Argentina's sales 
there were only a quarter of this. The deficit with Brazil, at 
175 million dollars, was up by a whopping 501.4 percent.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 6 May (NA) -- Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo stated on 6 May that the trade deficit "does not 
constitute a problem" because it is caused by the importation of 
capital goods, which produce "more investments." The economy 
minister stressed: "The increase in imports does not constitute 
a problem if it helps to increase our productive capacity." 
  Cavallo conceded that the unemployment number is 
"worrisome," 
while snapping out that "1.5 million new jobs have been created 
over the last four years." He argued: "During October 1989, 
there were 11.5 million people employed. This figure increased 
to 12.5 million in October 1993 while in the last six years it 
had grown by only 600,000." [passage omitted] 
  The minister said one should wonder "why more new jobs are 
not being created." He said many small- and medium-scale 
entrepreneurs "are afraid of the law on accidents on the 
shop-floor and current labor laws." 
  This prompted him to reiterate his request for the enactment 
of the Labor Flexibility Law because "we must have more 
realistic labor laws, at least for the Pymes [small- and 
medium-scale enterprises]." 
  To conclude, Cavallo pointed out that over the last three 
years the country has grown "25 percent," which means Argentina 
"has recorded the third largest growth rate in the world."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 9 May (NA) -- A Coast Guard cutter has 
intercepted and captured two trawlers flying foreign flags. The 
trawlers were fishing illegally in the Argentine exclusive 
economic zone, without the appropriate authorization. 
  The Coast Guard cutter "Mantilla" yesterday discovered a 
foreign trawler fishing near the port of Quequen. Upon boarding 
the trawler, Coast Guard personnel confirmed the existence of 79 
metric tons of squid, hake, and codfish in the trawler's hold 
and processing line. 
  Shortly thereafter, the same Coast Guard cutter discovered 
another trawler that had already caught 146 metric tons of squid 
and rays. 
  Both trawlers were captured for violating the National 
Fishing Law, and were escorted to the port of Quequen where the 
appropriate proceedings were conducted.

  [Text] National Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA) sources 
have estimated that the Atucha-2 nuclear power plant, which has 
been under construction since 1982, will become fully 
operational in 1997, and not next year, as CNEA Chairman Manuel 
Mondino announced recently in a news conference. 
  The Atucha-2 reactor was forged in Japan and welded in 
Germany. The 1,000 metric ton reactor was manufactured of fine 
steel and a manganese-molybdenum-nickel alloy. The 14-meter 
high reactor has been stored for seven years in a warehouse 200 
meters from the area where it will be finally installed. 
  During German Research and Technology Minister Paul 
Krueger's 
visit to Atucha-2 on 4 May, many spiderwebs on the reactor's 
support base were noticed. A heart crossed by an arrow, drawn 
with chalk on the reactor's metallic structure, was also 
noticed. The CNEA sources admitted that "no date has been set 
for the installation" of the reactor. CNEA sources involved in 
the project's management emphasized that the engine room and the 
engineering work have nearly been completed, but admitted that 
the assembly stage is stuck. Atucha-2's estimated cost totals 
about $3 billion. 
  The sources said that the project, which is under 
construction a few meters from the Atucha-1 nuclear power plant 
near the Parana de las Palmas River in Buenos Aires Province, 
has been delayed "considerably." The sources estimated this 
delay at "four to five years." In the sources' opinion, 
Atucha-2's construction problems arose from the Malvinas war, 
when the international loans that had been agreed for its 
financing were discontinued, and later from budget constraints 
and the hyperinflation of 1989. 
  The sources said that Atucha-2 "was a result of the maximum 
use of Atucha-1." The sources explained that the new reactor 
"is 20 percent larger" than Atucha-1, but will produce "more 
than double the energy of Atucha-1." While Atucha-1 has an 
output of 350 megawatts, using natural uranium and heavy water 
with 233 fuel elements, Atucha-2 will use the same system but 
will produce 745 megawatts with 451 fuel elements.

  [Text] La Paz, 6 May (EFE) -- Members of a commission of 
government and opposition deputies created to investigate human 
right violations have received threats. Concern over the 
threats increased following the suspicion that a group of 
policemen and a prosecutor were responsible for torturing 
several individuals. 
  Ivan Miranda, Press Workers Federation secretary general, 
said today: "Government and other public office officials are 
creating a climate of terror among press workers." 
  The deputies denounced a police structure operating outside 
of the law. 
  Jorge Justiniano, legislator and leader of Democratic 
Socialism Alternative (ASD), has reported "a repressive police 
superstructure that puts everyone in a dangerous state of 
juridical insecurity." 
  Other members of the commission, including ruling party 
Deputy Luis Eduardo Siles and Ramiro Barrenechea of the 
indigenous movement Eje Pachacuti, said they have received phone 
threats. 
  Barrenechea went even further. He said one third of all 
legislators are being spied on and persecuted by members of 
state security organs. Interior Minister German Quiroga sharply 
rejected the accusation characterizing it as "irresponsible." 
  Commission members recently questioned more than a dozen 
people who had been arrested on charges of drug trafficking or 
terrorism. They all said they had been illegally arrested, 
interrogated, and tortured in alleged clandestine police centers. 
  They agreed that prosecutor Jose Nemtala was responsible for 
their alleged illegal arrests and torture. 
  Nemtala, a drug trafficking case prosecutor assigned to the 
Special Police Investigation Corp (CEIP), testified before the 
congressional commission on 5 May. He denied all charges 
against him by individuals indicted on charges of trafficking or 
terrorism. 
  Nemtala did recognize having acted illegally when he 
arrested 
journalist Judith Munoz a few days ago. Her release was ordered 
without charges several days after Nemtala ordered her arrest 
without court permission to interrogate her on her alleged links 
with terrorists and, specifically, on the murder of two U.S. 
members of the Mormon Church. 
  Nemtala said he ordered the arrest based on indications of 
her alleged responsibility mentioned in a report produced by the 
FBI.

  [Text] European cooperation will be reduced, but the 
reduction will be minimal thanks to the endeavors of a Bolivian 
mission headed by Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar. The trip 
lasted 15 days and included key visits to Belgium, Germany, 
Spain, and the seat of the EU. 
  The foreign minister returned at 0600 on 2 May accompanied 
by 
International Relations Secretary Jaime Aparicio. He stressed 
that "the trip sought to minimize the reduction of cooperation 
that Bolivia receives from European countries. We believe we 
achieved that objective." 
  To emphasize the objectives achieved, the foreign minister 
mentioned the importance of a $31-million cooperation agreement 
that will be signed this year with the German Government. 
  He also announced that several contracts will soon be signed 
with the three communities that make up the Kingdom of Belgium. 
He said a Belgian mission will arrive in June to evaluate the 
implementation of the agreements reached by the 1992 joint 
commission and to make any necessary adjustments, but always 
"with the political desire to strengthen bilateral cooperation." 
  Negotiations with representatives of the EU regarding this 
year's cooperation are now concluded and the agreement will be 
signed in La Paz at the end of May. The most senior members of 
the EU commission, including Vice President Manuel Marin, will 
visit for this occasion. 
  Aranibar said European countries have projected a 
substantial 
reduction in their aid to poor countries due to their financial 
problems and to the ever-increasing need for cooperation with 
East European countries. 
  To palliate this reduction, the Bolivian diplomatic mission 
submitted a report on the state of cooperation and the benefit 
of cooperation programs for the country. It also highlights the 
implementation of government projects for change -- including 
the Popular Participation Program, educational reform, and 
capitalization. 
  The official Bolivian mission began its trip on 15 April in 
Brussels, the capital of Belgium, with meetings with government 
authorities and with representative of the EU, which is based in 
that city. 
  The foreign minister explained that new ties have been 
"knotted" with the French, Flemish, and Brussels communities, 
which make up the Federal Belgian Government and which have 
certain specific responsibilities for sectors pertaining to 
international cooperation and relations. 
  The Bolivian mission also extended President Gonzalo Sanchez 
de Lozada's invitation to the Belgian king to visit the country. 
"This invitation has been accepted by the Belgian king. His 
visit will most probably be made in 1995," Aranibar said. 
  The mission visited Germany between 24 and 27 April. A 
schedule has been established to carry out the preliminary steps 
to prepare the meeting of the joint commission that will be held 
before the end of the year in Germany. 
  A similar agreement was reached with the Spanish Government 
in which a schedule was prepared for meetings during the course 
of this year before the meeting of the joint commission. 
  The foreign minister explained that this trip served to 
promote the process of capitalizing state enterprises, in other 
words, to attract foreign investment to the country. 
  The construction of the gas pipeline to Brazil and the port 
of Ilo, two very important projects, were also explained to 
European investors. 
  The port of Ilo project attracted the interest of the 
enterprise that runs Hamburg Port and a German consulting firm 
and they will most probably carry out an overall study to 
determine the real possibilities of this port, which is very 
strategic for Bolivia.

  [Text] Santiago, 8 May (EFE) -- The National Renewal, the 
main rightist party in Chile, this weekend hardened its position 
on the government of President Eduardo Frei. National Renewal 
President Andres Allamand accused him of being "ambiguous" and 
"lacking coherence" in a harsh speech to mark the seventh 
anniversary of the party, which is considered the most moderate 
of the Chilean right. Allamand also criticized Interior Minister 
German Correa. 
  Allamand said the current administration, which was 
inaugurated on 11 March, is "dragging its feet." He said it 
lacks coherence, as reflected in the change of priorities of the 
announced policies in which institutional reforms have overtaken 
social reforms. 
  He said the government has not sent Congress any legal 
initiatives for solving the problems of poverty, education, and 
health. 
  He called on Frei to take "clear and personal" command. He 
added that those "in charge" are the leaders of the political 
parties of the government coalition which comprises the 
Christian Democrats, the Socialists, and the Social Democrats. 
  Allamand said the call asking the opposition to play a role 
is incoherent, because the interior minister [German Correa] 
made "unfortunate comments," saying that the charges of 
corruption by the opposition stain the Chilean image abroad. 
  In a harsh attack on Correa, who has become the target of 
the 
criticism of the right, Allamand recalled that the majority of 
Correa's Socialist friends in Spain are either "detained, at 
large, or writing their resignations." 
  He added that attitudes like that of Minister Correa in 
Chile 
open "the doors to generalized corruption" -- just like in Spain. 
  Allamand called on his party to free itself from the past 
and 
to preserve the unity of the "Union for Chile" rightist 
alliance, which also includes the Independent Democratic Union 
and the Center-Center Union. 
  Allamand offered his party's help to the government in 
solving the problems of poverty, health, and education but 
discarded any support for moves that seek "to destroy the basis 
of the institutions." 
  The government is studying a package of bills that it will 
send to Congress that seek to eliminate from the Constitution -- 
which was approved by the military regime of General Augusto 
Pinochet -- what has been called "the authoritarian remnants of 
the system." 
  These remnants include a clause that prevent the commanders 
of the Armed Forces from being removed, a clause that appoints 
senators without elections, and a clause to perpetuate the 
proportional representation electoral system.

that, although they support the decision, personal drug doses 
should be properly regulated; 25 percent said it was good to 
publicly approve drug use; 16.7 percent said it was a vote of 
confidence in young people; and 8.3 percent said they agreed 
with the decision because it would reduce the price of drugs. 
  We repeat that 85 percent voiced opposition to the 
decriminalization. Why did they oppose it? Some 31.3 percent 
said they opposed the ruling because it represented a health 
threat; 15 percent said it would put more criminals and drug 
addicts on the streets; 14.3 percent said they agreed with the 
call for a referendum on the issue; 7.5 percent said they were 
against decriminalization because it would lead to state 
corruption; 7.5 percent opposed it because it would create 
double standards within the Colombian judicial system; 7.5 
percent said young people must first be educated, adding that 
this task has yet to be carried out; 6.1 percent did not agree 
because they felt the decision was based on U.S. interference; 
5.4 percent did not agree because drug consumption is senseless; 
and 5.4 percent said they rejected the ruling because the 
current Constitution is inadequate and incongruous.

  [Text] Medellin -- The product-origin regulations in the 
textile and petrochemical sectors are the two points that need 
to be negotiated so that Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela can 
sign the G-3 [Group of Three] commercial integration agreement 
before Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's administration 
concludes. 
  This was reported by Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel 
Santos during the inauguration of the "Businessmen and Economic 
Opening" seminar, organized by the Colombian Foreign Trade 
Institute (Incomex). According to the minister, the 
negotiation's technical commission will hold a new meeting 
before the end of the week to try to reach a decision on the 
points pending on the 400-page agreement. 
  However, several businessmen, mainly in the textile sector, 
fear that political interests are taking precedence over 
commercial interests in the signing of the G-3 agreement. "We 
are worried that conditions unfavorable to the Colombian 
industrial sector might be accepted just so they can sign the 
agreement prior to leaving. Mexico is demanding 100-percent 
compliance with the product-origin regulations, and this is 
impossible," a textile industry businessmen stated. 
  With the signing of the G-3 and Caricom [Caribbean Common 
Market] agreements, which, according to Minister Santos, will 
also be negotiated next week, the government will have kept the 
entire integration program, which it proposed when the Foreign 
Trade Ministry was created. 
  The signing of approximately 22 bilateral and multilateral 
agreements have given the country access to a market of 200 
million Latin Americans, not just a market of 34 million 
Colombians. In addition to those agreements, the government also 
obtained tariff preferences from the United States and a 10-year 
agreement extension with the European Union. According to 
Minister Santos, "having 60 percent of the international markets 
tariff free, Colombia will have favored access to them, but will 
have to learn to sell and conquer those markets." 
<H5>  False Infrastructure </H5>
  To conquer the markets to which Colombia has guaranteed 
access through its commercial integration agreements, the 
country has to resolve its infrastructure and education 
problems. According to Santos, the country has a large 
infrastructure shortage and is under the Latin American average 
of 3.6 km of highway per citizen. "This means that, on average, 
our exports are 5-percent more expensive and that we are 
5-percent less competitive due to our shortcomings in terms of 
highways, without counting deficiencies in our airports and 
other communication systems," Santos added. 
  During his speech to inaugurate the Incomex seminar, Santos 
noted the scarcity of human resources. He highlighted the 
Monitor survey results that indicate that 85 percent of 
Colombian businessmen have expressed their dissatisfaction with 
the quality of human resources. 
  "The universities are increasingly below international 
averages; only 50 percent of our youth get to high school, and 
there is a 10-percent illiteracy rate," the minister asserted. 
According to the foreign trade minister, the competitive 
advantages were previously in natural resources and cheap labor. 
However, today, the most important advantages are in 
infrastructure and human resources. 
  Finally, Minister Santos referred to the need to attract 
foreign investment to the country since it will bring new 
technology, products, and jobs.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ernesto Samper, presidential candidate for the </F>
Liberal Party of Colombia, on 5 May; place not given -- live 
with recorded video presentation] 
  [Text] Good evening, Colombians. Colombia is experiencing 
one of those times in history when our dreams can come true. 
During President Cesar Gaviria's Liberal government, we 
adopted a new constitution, we began internationalizing our 
economy, and we began to dismantle narco-terrorism, thus 
demonstrating to the world that we are not the perpetrator but 
the main victim of this worldwide plague. Our destiny cannot be 
condemned to backwardness. We can succeed if we make a 
faithful, courageous commitment. But we still have a long way 
to go. Colombians continue to demand change. I will work 
unceasingly to make those changes. I hope to do so with the 
support of a modern, dynamic liberalism, free of the influence 
peddling and patronage of the past; a liberalism that is 
socially committed to a young, dynamic, and moral government, 
which is, above all, pledged to the social development of the 
Colombian people. 
  During my administration, we will begin the social phase of 
economic openness. We will put our heart and soul into this 
opening process and work to create jobs, social investment, and 
projects that will bring progress. That is why I chose Humberto 
de la Calle as my running mate for this great task of renewal. 
His experience during the Constituent Assembly, his management 
of the matters of state, and his unblemished career as an honest 
man are the guarantees I offer all Colombians. You have the 
opportunity to vote for a ticket that is not the result of 
improvisation but of serious reflection about who his truly 
capable of blazing a sure path to the future for all Colombians. 
  Other important members of the community will accompany us 
in 
this endeavor. Their support has been confirmed and 
consolidated in what we call the Alliance for Colombia. 
Progressive conservatives, the National Popular Alliance, 
Christians, Indians, Negroes, peasants, representatives of the 
left-wing democratic movements, and people with no party 
affiliation have enthusiastically answered our call to forge 
this great alliance and bring about profound social change. 
They who have never been given enough space to make their 
demands heard are the true spokespersons of that new Colombia. 
Their voices shall be heard for the first time, and they will 
feel a part of this country that had turned its back on them for 
so many years. 
  With your support, fellow Colombians, we will move together 
to take that giant social leap through the creation of more and 
better productive jobs. Employment is a requirement for peace. 
To decrease insecurity in our cities we must provide our youth 
with jobs. To prevent the countryside from being a fertile 
ground for criminals, we must support our peasants. Therefore, 
I pledge to generate 1.5 million new productive jobs. All of 
the efforts we have made over the past few years to modernize 
the economy will be futile if we fail to ensure that the 
benefits of openness reach the people -- the people of Colombia. 
Thus, I pledge to invest in education, health and housing, and 
especially to invest in women -- those with the greatest needs 
and greatest burdens. I will pay the social debt that Colombian 
society has owed its women for too many years. 
  My fellow Colombians, I am optimistic about Colombia's 
future. Colombia is the best place in the world to be born, to 
grow up, and to live with our children. I invite you to share 
this optimism with me. As you well know, thanks to God's mercy, 
I was given a second chance in life. I want to dedicate that 
second chance to work. With your support, I want to work so 
many more Colombians can have at least a single chance to 
progress in peace and justice. 
  Now I would like to show you a documentary that I have 
presented at more than 45 universities across the country. It 
explains some of my campaign's main proposals. 
  [Begin recording] [First unidentified speaker] We need to 
work. 
  [Second unidentified speaker] I haven't heard anything. 
  [Third unidentified speaker] There is no work in the field 
of 
mathematics. 
  [Second speaker] I haven't heard anything. 
  [Fourth unidentified speaker] Opportunities are sometimes 
rather scarce, aren't they? 
  [Second speaker] There is plenty of unemployment. 
  [Fifth unidentified speaker] Well, the job did not work out. 
  [Sixth unidentified speaker] Work? Selling strawberries and 
peaches. 
  [Seventh unidentified speaker] It is impossible to get a job 
these days. 
  [Eighth unidentified speaker] They have too many 
requirements. 
  [Ninth unidentified speaker] It is not easy to get a job in 
this field, so I am doing something very different now. 
  [Unidentified announcer] Unemployment will be the most 
pressing problem of the next century. In addition to the 
unemployed, there are also so-called informal workers in 
Colombia. They do have work, but under very difficult 
conditions. This phenomenon affects the young in particular. 
The unemployment rate among young adults is twice the national 
rate. 
  [Samper] Among the problems we face today, none is as 
important as unemployment. The solution to unemployment is the 
same solution to many other problems. The lack of public safety 
is related to unemployment. Problems on Colombian farmlands 
have plenty to do with unemployment. That is why I have 
promised to create 1.5 million jobs. I will do it with the 
following plans: 
  The difference between peace and war is at stake in the 
Colombian countryside. By giving subsidies back to farmers, I 
hope to create 120,000 new jobs in the agricultural sector in 
the next four years. 
  Colombia has extensive experience in the development of 
small 
enterprises. We have 1.2 million small enterprises, and we are 
going to make the most significant effort that any government 
has ever made to create 350,000 small businesses in the next 
four years. 
  We are going to help major businesses improve product 
quality, update technology, and reach the international market 
under truly competitive conditions. 
  Where there is no infrastructure, there can be no opening. 
Economic openness without ports, railroads, or highways is no 
openness at all. That is why we must make an enormous effort to 
develop our infrastructure with an investment of over $3 billion 
and by creating 100,000 jobs. 
  Economic openness has to be a two-way street. We buy from 
those countries that buy from us. It must be based on 
reciprocity. We will double our exports, which will allow us to 
create about 250,000 more jobs, within the same four-year period. 
  [First unidentified student] The technology at my university 
is about 20 years old. 
  [Second unidentified student] There is no place for 
scientific research. 
  [Third unidentified student] We need financial support to do 
things at the same level as the more developed countries. 
  [Fourth unidentified student] It is easier to make a 
satellite connection with some other country in the south than 
it is to make a microwave call to Monteria. 
  [Fifth unidentified student] I do not think the universities 
are producing professionals that meet the needs of the job 
market. 
  [Announcer] Whether a country is more or less advanced than 
others does not depend solely on how much money it has in its 
reserves or how rich it is in natural resources. It also 
depends on the degree of development of its educational and 
technological system. 
  [Samper] Today's world is no longer divided into the haves 
and the have-nots but among those who are educated and those who 
are not. We do not have education here. I intend to increase 
spending on science and technology from the current 0.6 percent 
to 2 percent by the end of my administration. Technology must 
be included in the education system. 
  I am going to create 200,000 apprenticeships so those high 
school graduates who are unable to enroll at a university can 
have practical training in the workplace, with a theoretical 
complement offered by the state through a new SENA [National 
Apprenticeship Service]. The investment we are going to make to 
better train people in Colombia will translate into better jobs 
for many Colombians, particularly young people. 
  [First unidentified speaker] Nobody takes care of or cares 
about our resources and the environment. 
  [Second unidentified speaker] Large industries are 
polluting. 
  [Third unidentified speaker] The environment is being 
destroyed. 
  [Fourth unidentified speaker] Most people are destroying the 
trees, animals, and everything. 
  [Fifth unidentified speaker] People have destroyed part of 
life. 
  [Sixth unidentified speaker] The peso sign is what is 
destroying the environment. 
  [Seventh unidentified speaker] Forests are being destroyed 
every day, and nobody says anything. 
  [Announcer] It is time to realize the damage we are doing to 
our environment. By destroying the woods, polluting rivers, and 
destroying life in natural reserves, we are also destroying the 
quality of life for Colombians of the 21st century. Those 
Colombians will be our children and our grandchildren. 
  [Samper] Do you know how many hectares of woods are 
destroyed 
in Colombia every minute? One hectare. That means 600,000 
hectares annually, and we only plant 14,000 hectares annually. 
That is why the environmental policy must be aimed first at 
creating an environmental awareness among children. Our defense 
of the environment must come from a commitment to solve what I 
consider the great ecological catastrophes of Colombia: the 
pollution of the Bay of Cartagena, the destruction of the Sierra 
Nevada de Santa Marta, the renewal of the Madgalena River as a 
vital artery in our ecosystem, the defense of the Sierra La 
Macarena, and the protection of the forests in Choco and 
Amazonia Departments. 
  In my government, all companies that pollute will have to 
pay 
for the damage they have done to society so we can improve and 
restore the environment. 
  [Unidentified speaker] There is corruption in every aspect 
of 
society. 
  [Second unidentified speaker] Corruption is an everyday 
thing 
here. 
  [Third unidentified speaker] We need more honesty. 
  [Fourth unidentified speaker] Corruption hides behind some 
neckties. 
  [Announcer] The great problem of our democracy is 
corruption. 
To enable the state to assume its great responsibilities, we 
need to eradicate corruption, illegal enrichment, and the 
immorality that has permeated public administration. 
  [Samper] Corruption eats at night what a society achieves 
during the day. That is why I have presented an anticorruption 
statute which, unlike other statutes, commits citizens to the 
struggle against corruption, because it is a challenge and a 
problem that belongs to everyone. We have issued a code of 
ethics for my campaign. It is being executed by an ethics 
administrator. This code of ethics begins by establishing 
ethical limitations on myself and on my campaign. If we give 
jobs to youths, they will not have to join the People's 
Militias. If we give jobs to peasants, they will not join the 
ranks of subversion, nor will they have to smuggle drugs 
overseas. For me, employment is the new word for peace. [end

<F P=106> [Responses to an EL TIEMPO questionnaire on campaign issues </F>
by Colombian presidential candidates Ernesto Samper Pizano of 
the Liberal Party, Andres Pastrana of the Conservative Party, 
and Antonio Navarro Wolff of the 19 April Movement-Democratic 
Alliance] 
  [Text] [EL TIEMPO] 1. When and how does corruption occur? 
In your opinion, where are the highest levels of corruption in 
Colombia? 
  [Samper] The country's highest corruption rates are found 
within the public administration because of influence peddling, 
irregularities in the handling of contracts and procedures, and 
illegal actions by government officials. Certain positions 
within the government are more vulnerable to corruption and the 
abuse of power because of the nature of their functions. 
Therefore, the plan against corruption I have proposed includes 
special mechanisms to identify and control those positions and 
create "transparency zones" [zonas de transparencia] in the 
administration. 
  [Pastrana] The highest levels of corruption in Colombia are 
linked to the large mafias, particularly the mafias involved in 
drug trafficking and contraband. These mafias have managed to 
infiltrate institutions such as civil aeronautics, customs, 
justice, and the political system. Administrative corruption 
has also grown because the state continues to be viewed as 
political booty. The result is a distorted administrative 
structure -- one without goals, dominated by power brokers, 
characterized by permanent changes in leadership, and which 
lacks incentives for honest officials; one in which 
disorganization fosters corruption. Taking into consideration 
that this same "politization" dominates our control mechanisms 
and that our justice system has shown little efficiency, is not 
hard to understand that why a climate that favors the use of 
public posts for personal gain has spread. 
  [Navarro] THE ECONOMIST has described Colombia as one of the 
most corrupt countries in the world. We believe it is one of 
the most corrupt countries in Latin America. The roots of 
corruption are embedded in the decomposition of our social 
values, where religious ethics have not been maintained or have 
been replaced by secular ethics. Corruption is eroding 
relations between the public and private sectors in two main 
areas: decisionmaking and compliance with the law. In order for 
corruption to exist, someone must be willing to receive money 
and someone must be willing to pay it. In the state, corruption 
is basically concentrated in the Executive Branch, because this 
is where most decisions are made and most funds are handled. 
Taking into account there are some exceptions, corruption 
occurs from the highest national levels to the lowest municipal 
levels. This is clearly associated with public activities, 
particularly with politics. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 2. Will you "negotiate" with Congress? Congress 
and the government have been criticized for negotiating bills in 
exchange for sinecures (appropriations, positions, etc.). Do 
you believe this mechanism contributes to corruption? Would you 
employ it during your tenure? 
  [Samper] Of course this mechanism contributes to corruption, 
and therefore, I will not use it. That was why the Ethics Code 
of last year's campaign clearly stipulated the responsibility of 
congressmen supporting my candidacy. Those congressmen are 
committed to back and promote from Congress the approval of 
measures aimed at facilitating the government plan I have been 
presenting to Colombians. In a way, it is a programmatic vote 
at a national level. 
  [Navarro] Independent government branches are essential in a 
mature democracy. Therefore, not only will I not employ this 
mechanism, but I propose that as of today, it be considered a 
crime to do so. 
  [Pastrana] The country strongly opposed the appropriations. 
Therefore, we should not yield to any pressure to reinstate 
them. The problem of positions is linked to a concept of 
bureaucratic rewards that causes great harm to the country. The 
weak partisan structures make relations between the president 
and Congress difficult. We must establish rules to ensure 
governability. I believe it would be a good idea to explore the 
mechanism of a pact similar to the one signed by the New 
Democratic Force with President Gaviria. That pact should seek 
a commitment with the government plans, and, at the same time, 
it should publicly assume responsibility in policies. In 
addition, we should create a political consensus around a 
development plan that would alleviate pressure on annual budgets. 
  3. Other Measures 
  [EL TIEMPO] What other measures, in addition to draft bills 
or statutes, will you implement to fight corruption? 
  [Samper] Our task is to once again make ethics a form of 
social behavior. To my way of thinking, it is fundamental that 
the laws generate credibility and thus encourage citizen 
participation, which I consider the only way to win the struggle 
against corruption. If we do not get the people to join the 
struggle by reporting and cooperating, the task of moralization 
will be very difficult. I intend for my government to once 
again have grade school classes in constitutional ethics and 
civics instituted, so that new citizens being formed in school 
classes may once again take up the lost concept of good 
citizenship. 
  [Pastrana] I have already begun. The Congress Ethics 
Commission was created at my request and has started combating 
corruption in the Legislative Branch. The statute against 
corruption that I submitted will allow the state the legal basis 
to investigate and prevent corrupt behavior. It is important to 
break up that "marriage" between the corruptor and a corrupt 
person. An organization with power and citizen support is 
required to carry out intelligence operations as specified in 
the statute. 
  Special treatment and a commitment by society and by the 
state is required in order to cope with the Mafia. The status 
of the war against narcotics trafficking is a result of the 
permissiveness of government and society. Contraband has always 
been allowed by the passive and permissive attitude of society. 
First, there were the sanandresitos [area where smuggled goods 
are sold openly], and today there are strong ties between 
contraband and money laundering. The presence of these monies in 
political parties and in Congress is an insult to the country. 
Society must wage a considerable battle against contraband if 
we want to defend our industries and our jobs. 
  The issue of the Cusiana [oil fields] is something else. The 
country is worried about the macroeconomic effects, but it has 
not devoted much attention to how to prevent corrupt practices 
associated with financial boons. Many countries have squandered 
opportunities that have arisen from such a boon. 
  [Navarro] Laws and statutes are necessary. They must 
include appointing civic supervisors, punishing more severely 
front men in money laundering operations and those who pay 
bribes, lifting bank secrecy laws, requiring public officials to 
provide statements of income, strengthening control mechanisms, 
and rewarding informants, among other things. In addition, two 
essential things are needed: 
  A) To practice new ethics and preach by good example, 
starting with the president of the Republic; and 
  B) To organize an Operation Clean Hands as of 1500 on 7 
August 1994 led by the Search Bloc against corruption, with the 
participation of the Presidency of the Republic, the Prosecutor 
General's Office, the Attorney General's Office, the Treasury 
Overseer's Office, and the technical and support teams that are 
necessary. 
  4. Strategies 
  [EL TIEMPO] How will you cope with corruption at the 
national, departmental, and local levels? 
  [Samper] This will be done by strictly applying the 
anticorruption statute which I presented and which I hope will 
become a law as soon as possible. In addition, it is necessary 
to promote citizen participation in this struggle against 
corruption, through public trials, citizens supervisors, and 
privileged access to information. 
  Colombian democracy cannot succumb to the cancer of 
corruption, which is as dangerous as violence itself. It must 
strengthen and expedite the work of the control mechanisms. The 
Attorney General's Office, the Comptroller General's Office, and 
the Treasury Overseer's Office exist for these basic purposes. 
As for the issue of regional officials, that worries me, 
because we cannot allow this great democratic achievement of 
political decentralization to be foiled by the actions of 
corrupt and immoral regional officials. The people in the 
regions must choose their representatives well, since this is 
the only manner of ensuring that decentralization successfully 
stays on course. 
  [Pastrana] It is essential to strengthen and make 
independent 
all control structures. This must be done not only among those 
in charge of disciplinary and penal control, but also among 
those responsible for the control of efforts and results. In 
the first case, it is important that the country have a visible 
leader from whom the people can demand results. The Attorney 
General's Office must take over this role in cases of 
administrative corruption, just as the Prosecutor General's 
Office has been doing for other crimes. 
  In the second case, deficiencies at the comptrollerships 
are considerable and more attention should be paid to them. It 
is also necessary to strengthen the superintendencies to prevent 
aberrant situations such as those observed in the public 
services, or financial crises such as we had in 1982 or the one 
that Venezuela is currently experiencing. To conclude, a pledge 
must be made to modernize the administration, increase the 
continuity of the managerial structure, and actively involve 
various civic organization in the administration and 
surveillance of public services. 
  [Navarro] The points outlined above are the main strategies 
we will use. In addition, we will adopt the following specific 
measures: 
  A) We will give the post of Overseer of the Treasury 
permanent status, maintain Dr. Jorge Garcia Hurtado as its 
director, give that office more punitive duties and its own 
agents in the departments and in the 50 most highly populated 
municipalities of the country. We will also establish alternate 
overseers in the municipalities that receive sizable bonuses. 
  B) As of 7 August 1994 all employees, beginning with the 
president and vice president of the Republic, must declare their 
properties and incomes at the Office of the Overseer of the 
Treasury. The GAZETTE will publish the declarations of 
officials who have jurisdiction and control on the day they are 
sworn in and on the day they retire. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 5. What is the connection between the 
centralization of power and corruption? What will you do about 
this situation? 
  [Samper] Someone once said: "Absolute power corrupts 
absolutely." Therefore, the best way to avoid this corrupting 
power is to open democracy, decentralize power, and implement 
efficient and effective mechanisms like the ones foreseen in the 
new Constitution. This connection exists throughout the world, 
and therefore, it is essential to continue to achieve progress 
in the regional and local autonomy processes -- so that power is 
distributed among more people and so the citizenry has more 
access to it. Fortunately, in Colombia we have a presidential 
regime; with the 1991 Constitution, we continue to strengthen 
the other two state branches: the Legislative Branch and the 
Judicial Branch. Nevertheless, we can and must do much more for 
the balance and independence of these branches, and to give more 
power to the regions. 
  [Pastrana] I have no doubts about the connection between the 
concentration of power and corruption -- both political power 
and economic power -- and even worse is the possibility of 
either of them ending up controlling the media. The Television 
Broadcasting Law should ensure that this cannot happen and that 
the Executive Branch should be ready to fight the figureheads 
with all means at its disposal. 
  We must also strengthen the overseeing authorities and 
establish political campaign financing limits. 
  [Navarro] Of course there is a connection. The 
centralization of power implies a weakening of checks and 
balances. This is why we will move toward a balance of power, 
as outlined by the spirit of the Constitution. We will also use 
the Search Block we mentioned before to combat our current 
problems. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 6. Campaign financing could generate corruption. 
What changes will you make in this area? 
  [Samper] I believe significant steps have already been taken 
to control the entry of funds whose origin is unknown. There 
are two basic measures that should be highlighted: government 
financing and the work of the Overseer of the National Treasury. 
It is urgently necessary for these measures to go even further, 
and it is up to us candidates to show transparency and honesty 
in financing our campaigns. This is why I appointed a director 
of ethics to control our income. 
  [Pastrana] Illegal money and contributions by economic 
groups 
should be handled differently. Regarding the former, 
eradication is part of the comprehensive strategy I proposed 
against drug trafficking and contraband. We must also fight the 
negative influence of economic groups and their control over 
politics. The 1991 Constitution took one step forward by 
obliging the state to finance political campaigns and by 
controlling the contributions made by private individuals. To 
do this, we need to tighten the measures regarding auditing, 
accountability, and public reporting of campaign resources. 
  [Navarro] It is absolutely essential to establish spending 
limits for political campaigns. The ceilings do exist today, 
but there is no control over penalties for those who violate 
them. I propose that the Overseer of the National Treasury 
serve as the authority to enforce these controls and that any 
violation of them be reason for disqualification. 
  In addition, it is essential that information regarding 
campaign finances be verifiable and that any related violation 
also be reason for harsh penalties. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 7. The Inspector General's Office, the Attorney 
General's Office, and the Comptroller General's Office require 
changes to become more effective. What are these changes, and 
when should such changes be implemented? 
  [Samper] It is necessary to make investigation procedures 
more efficient and to conduct them expeditiously to convince the 
people, who often do not believe these institutions are 
reliable. It is necessary to eliminate obstacles and simplify 
procedures. Investigations of public officials should not go on 
for four or five years, and sentences should not be announced 
when the officials are no longer in office. Greater efforts 
must be made to update and improve these institutions. Also, it 
is necessary to standardize penalties and procedures for all 
public officials. It might even be advisable to consider the 
possibility of officials waiving statute of limitations benefits 
in disciplinary investigations in corruption cases. 
  [Pastrana] All of these institutions require urgent changes. 
Nevertheless, I do not think there are any clear-cut means to 
enable the people to assess the results of such changes. The 
Attorney General's Office should become the great visible leader 
in the fight against corruption -- the great ally of the people. 
This office should be invested with broad powers to conduct 
investigations and show results to society. The Comptroller 
General's Office should be made to fit the new concept of 
stringent procedures and results. It is incredible that, while 
our public institutions are inefficient, the citizens do not 
have information enabling them to pressure for the necessary 
changes. 
  [Navarro] Several changes have already been mentioned, in 
particular those within the Inspector's Office, which seek to 
strengthen the office and keep the current inspector. This is 
very important because he has exceeded the expectations placed 
on his position. An Inspector's Office without bite is of no 
use. 
  The Comptroller General's Office requires in-depth reforms, 
because it is one of the state's most influence-peddling 
institutions. This is why we did not include it in the 
Countercorruption Search Block that we propose. 
  It is necessary to start by changing the procedure to 
appoint 
the comptroller general, for which the Congress is currently 
responsible. The comptroller general should be appointed by the 
attorney general, the Inspector General's Office, and the 
Legislative Assembly's judicial commission. In addition, the 
comtroller general's control functions should be strengthened 
urgently as ordered by the Constitution. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 8. During your administration, what specific 
mechanisms will the citizens have to actively participate in the 
struggle against corruption? 
  [Pastrana] There are several mechanisms that should be 
implemented. First, public hearings would allow public 
officials and the community's representatives to meet to discuss 
and resolve matters related to efficiency and morality in 
carrying out the tasks in the relevant institutions. Meanwhile, 
civilian overseers should be organized with the power to request 
from state officials information on contracts and agreements 
signed by various administrations. This will allow the citizens 
to know what these contracts are all about. Last, the promotion 
of active participation is necessary by the various media in 
this struggle in order to facilitate this task. 
  [Samper] The people and the press should play an active role 
in the struggle against corruption. It is important to instill 
in the citizens high moral values and to organize a broad 
council whose main goal will be to outline goals and assess 
results. Moreover, the common, everyday citizen should be 
constantly informed on the quality of services he receives and 
on the costs of negligence and corruption he is forced to pay. 
To reach this goal, it is necessary to have more dynamic media 
and to establish an information system of an obligatory nature 
that is easily understood by all Colombians. 
  [Navarro] The citizens will have two specific types of 
anticorruption duties: 
  A) The accusation, with mechanisms as those previously 
mentioned, such as protection of witnesses and rewards for 
information, which would go to individuals or to organized 
communities. 
  B) Control of the process of public contracts and their 
execution, as well as in the decisionmaking process in matters 
of public interests We will also establish the community tax 
clearance certificate. 
  A great deal of encouragement will be given to all of those 
municipal administrations that, in keeping with current laws, 
offer active participation to citizens when awarding contracts 
for public works projects in the community. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 9. And what about the police? Are the changes 
implemented in the police effective enough to control corruption 
within this institution? Why? 
  [Samper] We cannot deny that progress has been made in 
cleansing the police. Nevertheless, the population still 
considers corruption to be the main problem within this 
institution, which obviously encourages growing distrust. The 
recent creation of the post of national high commissioner and 
the excellent performance by the former directors have 
contributed to the institution's efficiency. Likewise, it has 
contributed to improving the institution's public image. 
However, there is still much to be done such as training, 
increasing the number of units, especially in the large cities, 
and establishing efficient and acceptable mechanisms that will 
prevent excesses by some institution members. 
  [Pastrana] For many years we have neglected our police. 
Restoring citizen safety depends in great measure on our ability 
to rescue this institution. Changes are important, but we must 
be cautious in order to be able to adapt to an ever-changing 
situation. I would welcome a more concrete commitment by the 
Executive Branch, because the reforms, including the 
institution's control and cleansing guidelines require 
significant investment. 
  [Navarro] Apparently, not. It is necessary to wait for the 
results of the preliminary report prepared by the National 
Commission, a body created within the police as a result of the 
recent restructuring. If it is demonstrated that it is 
insufficient, new changes will need to be implemented to grant 
more control to the population. 
  [EL TIEMPO] 10. Performance Indicators. If you were 
president, which indicators could the Colombian people resort to 
in order to evaluate your performance in the struggle against 
corruption? 
  [Samper] They could rely on the most important indicator for 
a public official: the ability to honor promises made -- my word. 
  [Pastrana] During my administration, I will be committed to 
eradicating contraband from Colombia. We are talking about a 
frontal and permanent struggle for the survival of our entire 
industry and honest work in general. Another of my objectives 
is to continue the battle the country has been waging against 
the influence of drug trafficking. All the officials in my 
administration will be honest and divorced from petty political 
party interests. We cannot continue attacking influence 
peddling during campaigns and at the same time exercise it in 
the government. 
  [Navarro] The indicators will be as follows: 
  A) The number of inmates and persons tried for crimes 
carried out against the public. 
  B) The public resources recovered during Operation Clean 
Hands, which I propose be carried out by the Search Bloc against 
corruption. 
  C) The number of citizens overseeing operations throughout 
the country at the end of my term. 
  D) The number of public officials who demonstrate 
transparency in carrying out their duties, which will be 
measured through their disclosing their income and property. 
  E) The results of the reforms implemented to the 
institutions to which I referred previously.

<F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The controversial sentence reduction process with 
confessed drug trafficker Juan Diago Arcila Henao, a.k.a. El 
Tomate, which had been denounced by a Barranquilla judge as a 
judicial outrage, was overturned today by the Santa Fe de Bogota 
judge who reviewed the case. This is the first time this has 
occurred following negotiations between a prosecutor and a 
criminal. 
  More than 15 days ago, on direct orders of the Justice 
Ministry, a Santa Fe de Bogota regional judge began to examine 
the sentence reduction agreement that the Prosecutor's Office 
had negotiated with El Tomate. Serious flaws were found that 
did not justify the sentence reduction that had been granted. 
According to the deal annulled today, Juan Diego Arcila Henao's 
17-year sentence for drug trafficking, illicit enrichment, and 
conspiracy to commit crime had been reduced to only four years 
for confessing, cooperating, and providing information. El 
Tomate's new sentence must now be decided. 
  This is the first time a deal with a drug trafficking 
kingpin 
has been rejected. This newscast has also learned that in order 
to avoid new overly generous sentence reduction agreements 
between drug traffickers and prosecutors, a special oversight 
commission will be created to review legal proceedings against 
important capos.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 10 
May: 
  Officials from the Tax and Customs Directorate will have to 
answer for the loss of 60,000 exportation forms, which has 
partially paralyzed export transactions. Customs authorities 
believe the forms were stolen with the intention of selling them 
on the black market for 20 million pesos each. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT 4 May 
94) 
  Inflation so far this year is running at 12 percent. Some 
2.8 million Colombians are unemployed, compared with the 
unemployment figure of 2 million recorded in 1990. Meanwhile, 
exports are down from 1991's high of $7.2 billion. Today, 
annual imports amount to about $9 billion, compared to $4 
billion in 1991. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by Justice Minister Alexandre </F>
Dupeyrat; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] As you all know, several public service sectors have 
been demanding salary increases over the last few months. The 
government admits that as a whole public employees receive low 
salaries, as do most Brazilian earners of salaries. Aware of 
this situation, the government has been implementing economic 
and financial reforms that will soon allow the country to resume 
development and, above all, improve the standard of living of 
workers in general. 
  Despite government efforts, however, some believe they can 
coerce the federal executive branch into granting special favors 
to certain sectors of public employees. Within this framework 
some sectors of the Federal Police, dissatisfied with their 
current salaries, began a strike many weeks ago. This strike 
has been hindering activities linked to public security, which 
are essential for normal national life, and have been generating 
violent actions against the public and against public assets. 
These sectors have been doing all this in an attempt to 
intimidate the federal government and exert pressure on it. 
  The government will not allow public order to be threatened 
by those who have the duty to preserve it. It will not allow 
government assets to be unduly used or raided. It will not 
allow essential public services to be discontinued. Complying 
with the obligations that the Constitution and the laws impose 
on it, the executive branch will adopt all measures needed to 
maintain public order and preserve public security and peace.

  [Excerpts] Federal Police, PF, agents -- who have been on 
strike for more than one month -- have closed the PF offices in 
three states. Even passport issuance has been suspended. 
  In Salvador, Bahia State, the gates to the PF office were 
closed all day today. No one could enter the building. This 
ballet dancer should have left for a tour of Germany today, but 
she was unable to get a passport despite having insisted very 
much on the need to have it. 
  In Belem, Para State, the gate opening to the patio of the 
PF 
office was also closed. The policemen cordoned off the building 
and did not allow anyone in, not even the PF superintendent and 
the PF inspectors. Nothing functioned here today. 
  In Rio de Janeiro, the PF central office at Maua Square in 
the downtown area remained closed. The passport issuance 
department also remained closed. 
  In Sao Paulo, some PF agents demonstrated in front of the PF 
headquarters. A large number of people became angry at finding 
the doors to the passport issuance department closed. 
  The PF agents suspended their activities entirely when 
President Itamar Franco reported that he will not meet their 
demands. The police inspectors also decided to suspend passport 
issuance. 
  At the Guarulhos International Airport in Great Sao Paulo, 
only two PF inspectors are controlling the passengers' luggage 
and passports. 
  Some 80 landing and takeoff operations are scheduled for 
today. The situation has been calm all day long, but the 
movement will increase later on tonight, when there will be 
flights every 15 minutes. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What sort of 
activities are hindered by this strike? 
  [Lauro Trapp, president of the PF Agents Union] Mainly the 
activities in the areas of passports, registration of 
foreigners, and renewal of permanent residence permits. Airport 
supervision has been entirely abandoned. [end recording] 
  President Franco has summoned a meeting to discuss the PF 
situation. The government has considered calling on the Army to 
ensure free access to the PF facilities. [passage omitted] 
  It was decided during the two-hour meeting that the justice 
minister will address the nation to explain the PF situation. 
As an intervention has not been announced, the demonstrators 
have already left the PF central headquarters here in Brasilia.

  [Excerpts] Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero yesterday 
reported that by mid-May all public utility rates will be 
converted into URV's [Real Value Units] and that the conversion 
of insurance policies, mutual funds, and farming loans will be 
defined by the end of May. 
  The government promises to announce the monetary and 
exchange 
policy rules on 1 June. As of 1 July, there will be 15 days to 
change real cruzeiros for reals at banks. Bank checking and 
savings accounts, financial applications like commodities and 
mutual investment funds will be converted to URV's automatically 
based on the 1 July URV rate. [passage omitted] 
  Throughout those 15 days banks will be authorized to remain 
open one more hour per day just to exchange real cruzeiro notes 
for reals. The Central Bank will release 1.9 billion real notes 
and nearly 800 million real coins.

  [Text] Brasilia -- In a communique issued yesterday, the 
Army Social Communications Center (Cecomsex) characterized as 
"politically-ideologically oriented, Nazi-Fascist, and clearly 
illegal and pointless" a decision made by the Rio de Janeiro 
State Regional Medical Council [CREMERJ] against General Ricardo 
Agnese Fayad of the Army Medical Corps. On 5 May CREMERJ 
canceled Fayad's medical license on charges of having supervised 
the torture of political prisoners during the military regime. 
Fayad is currently serving as the Army's deputy health director. 
  The communique says: "The Brazilian Army strongly rejects 
any 
innuendo concerning the behavior of its members when the 
appropriate legal procedures have not been followed." It adds 
that Fayad, whom President Itamar Franco promoted to brigadier 
general on 31 March, "has an outstanding record of services 
rendered to the Army and to the nation, both as a physician and 
as an officer." 
  Fayad was charged with having worked for the DOI-CODI 
[Internal Operations Department-Internal Defense Operations 
Center] at the then 1st Army in the Tijuca district in Rio de 
Janeiro, where he allegedly worked with Lieutenant Amilcar Lobo 
-- a psychiatrist who had his license canceled by CREMERJ in 
1988 -- in evaluating the physical resistance of torture victims 
and in providing guidance to torturers. 
  The Army communique, which is signed by Cecomsex Chief 
General Gilberto Serra, adds that pursuant to Law 5526 of 1968, 
military physicians cannot be held accountable before regional 
medical councils for the technical-professional duties they may 
be required to perform as servicemen. Besides, the communique 
adds, the amnesty law has rendered any excess that either side 
may have committed unpunishable.

  [Text] Dissatisfied with the treatment it has received from 
the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and with Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso's drop in popularity, the PFL [Liberal Front 
Party] has already begun to secretly design an alternative 
strategy. The party will set a deadline for Cardoso. If the 
candidate does not "take off," the party will try to sponsor the 
candidacy of former President Jose Sarney, who would be running 
for the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. 
  Sarney believes that if the PMDB chooses Orestes Quercia it 
will be committing "electoral suicide." After the last 
Datafolha poll on 6 May -- which showed that Sarney's popularity 
was almost at the same level of that of Cardoso -- Sarney 
changed his routine as ex-president into that of a candidate on 
campaign. 
  There is an atmosphere of rebellion within the PFL. Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes believes Cardoso has thus far "played badly" 
and "must begin talking about starvation and unemployment." The 
PSDB leadership is betting on Cardoso's recovery. This week he 
will begin touring the country.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Marcio Moreira Alves] </F>
  [Text] The idea that only leftists demand the right to be 
heard about the programs and actions of their parties is a 
wrongful prejudice that is shared by journalists, intellectuals, 
and some politicians. Centrist and rightist politicians and 
voters also want to be heard. 
  The PFL [Liberal Front Party], whose leadership has been 
pressured because of the alliance with the PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party], could find an exhaust valve in Deputy 
Gustavo Krause's "Principles and Main Targets for a Program of 
Government," a study that the deputy has coordinated for several 
months. The document, which was drawn up by a commission made 
up of Daniel Dantas, Mauro Salles, Nilton Molina, Paulo Guedes, 
Roberto Procopio Lima Netto, and Thomaz Pompeu Magalhaes, was 
submitted to Jorge Bornhausen on 4 May, and will be released to 
the 3,000 party executive boards, 18,000 party councilmen, and 
to the deputies, senators, and governors in order to listen to 
suggestions and to introduce changes into it. 
  The 83-page PFL document is as thick as the 112-page PT 
[Workers Party] report. The main difference is that it attaches 
much more importance to economic and financial problems, and 
that it proposes more concrete solutions, especially in those 
fields. This emphasis has been caused, first, by the fact that 
the economy has preponderance over politics in a country that 
has been plunged into chronic superinflation; and second by the 
number of economists on the commission, beginning with the 
coordinator. 
  The study identifies five phases of the crisis: the 
political 
crisis, with the operational difficulties of democracy and 
inefficiency of the state; the currency devaluation crisis; the 
misery and starvation crisis; the ethical crisis; and the crisis 
of confidence. The study says: "Even though these are 
different phases, the fate is the same: an impasse. The 
political sector has proven to be extraordinarily incapable of 
creating a minimum consensus in the search for a solution to the 
impasse. Everyone has opposed everyone in this search." 
  The principles of a political alliance and of a joint 
program 
of government "should be: A) the reform of the political system; 
B) the reform of the state, which should be politically strong 
and managerially efficient; and C) a development pattern based 
on: the reorganization of the economy and the expansion of the 
market, which should become increasingly global, competitive, 
and specialized; on the promotion of human rights; on the 
preservation of natural resources; and on increasingly 
expeditious and creative managerial standards, both for the 
public and private sectors." 
  Economic stability is a precondition that the PFL sets 
before 
anything else. The study says that "no income-generating 
sector, including the state, is powerful enough to curb 
inflation. The fight against inflation is fought by the entire 
nation." 
  In the operational part -- in addition to the well-known 
position favoring an independent, strong Central Bank that 
preserves the currency; an end to monopolies; an end to 
discrimination against foreign capital; privatization with 
strong participation by social funds; and a smaller state with 
the implementation of a new federal pact -- the program raises 
an innovative proposal: the reconciliation of the debts and 
credits that the Union and the state and municipal governments 
are demanding from one another, in a Credit Clearing Chamber 
that might operate through National Social Treasury Bonds 
(Osins). Such bonds could also be used as currency for 
privatizations. The document also makes interesting proposals 
for fiscal reform, advocating an end to the revenue allocations 
provided for by the Constitution. The proposal to adopt a 
single 10 percent income tax proves that the document is 
ideologically based on Reaganism. 
  There are also encouraging positions on public security, 
science and technology, and regional policies for the Amazonas 
and for the northeastern region. Summarizing, the PFL study is 
serious and is worth reading. It is actually a pioneering, 
innovative effort for conservative parties, a document that 
seeks to compete with the ideas of the leftist parties.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of "exclusive" interview with Aloizio </F>
Mercadante, Workers Party, PT, deputy for Sao Paulo, by 
unidentified FOLHA reporter on 8 May; place not given] 
  [Text] [Folha] Brazil has just concluded an agreement over 
a $49 billion portion of its $135.2 billion foreign debt. PT 
candidate Lula has said that he wants to revise the agreement. 
How would a prospective PT government address the Brazilian 
foreign debt issue? 
  [Mercadante] We are not planning to begin the government 
with 
any unilateral measure, but the PT believes that the debt 
remains a major foreign policy issue. 
  First, the guarantees that the agreement demanded from 
Brazil 
are totally inappropriate. The cost of obtaining the reserves 
($2.5 billion) for guaranteeing the accord was tremendous for 
public finances. The guarantees are absolutely unacceptable. 
  It was an agreement made by a weak, dismantled government 
that had no political support. We cannot allow that instead of 
Brazil managing its debt, the debt should manage Brazil. This 
will not happen with our government. 
  [FOLHA] The debt agreement that was negotiated is better 
than 
the agreement signed by Mexico and Argentina. 
  [Mercadante] In those cases the countries received money 
from 
the International Monetary Fund to finance their guarantees, 
something that did not happen with Brazil. The fact that the 
economic plan was not ready, and that the IMF refused to provide 
the funds, proves that the agreement was hastily concluded. Why 
wasn't it possible to wait two more months after 11 years of 
negotiations? 
  [FOLHA] What will be the party position toward foreign 
investment in Brazil in areas like the stock exchange? Will 
that money be considered speculation capital? 
  [Mercadante] We want development to promote our massive 
consumer market, and to this end we need investment, foreign 
investment. We want to attract that money, and stock markets 
are mechanisms for attracting it. Yet we have to see that the 
money is used for economic growth, creating long-range financing 
funds. We must be competent to attract that money. Otherwise, 
it will end up going somewhere else. 
  [FOLHA] Isn't there any bias over the money that enters or 
leaves the stock market? 
  [Mercadante] Not at all. What we have been unable to do is 
to transform the capital inflow in productive investment. We 
will not solve the problems by either closing the markets or 
rejecting the money. Our economy must remain open, but we 
should also reform the financial system in order to attract 
productive investment.

<F P=106> [From the FOLHA bureau in Manaus, Amazonas State] </F>
  [Text] The Amazonas State Federal Police [PF] believe that 
the illegal trade in fish between Brazil and Colombia is 
concealing the international cocaine trafficking activities of 
the Leticia cartel. 
  According to Police Inspector Mauro Sposito, superintendent 
of the Amazonas State PF, the traffickers use fish to smuggle 
the drugs. 
  Sposito said that it has been learned that cocaine 
trafficking from Colombia to the United States is controlled by 
two Colombian brothers known as Evaristo and Henri. They own 
two fish packing plants that are used in the laundering of drug 
trafficking money. 
  A supervisor at the Brazilian Institute for the Environment 
and Renewable Natural Resources, who did not want to identify 
himself, suspects that the Colombian boats that come to Brazil 
to fetch fish are loaded with cocaine.

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy last night asked the 
Colorado Party to strive to continue Paraguay's development. 
He said this at the headquarters of the Colorado Party during a 
celebration to recall the first anniversary of the general 
elections, which the party won. Party President Eugenio 
Sanabria Cantero thanked Colorado workers and peasants for not 
following "corrupt union leaders." 
  The chief of state recalled that the Colorado Party won the 
9 
May 1993 general elections. He told party members that the 
party's current challenge as a government party is that of 
facing underdevelopment and the fight for health, education, and 
welfare. 
  When asked later if he alluded to the recent strikes when, 
during his speech, he said that Paraguay must not be paralyzed, 
Wasmosy answered: "I refer to all those who wish to stop the 
machine." 
  He indicated that every effort must be made to enable 
Paraguay to win in the formidable war against underdevelopment. 
He stated that he made this request as president of the 
Republic and as commander in chief of the Armed Forces. 
  Wasmosy said: "I do not need and I do not want Wasmosistas 
or 
any type of istas. I need and demand upright men, capable 
citizens, loyal aides, and colleagues with whom I can work and 
who are willing to face challenges with intelligence, 
imagination, and courage." 
  He called for an end to sectarian fanaticism that motivates 
intrigue, slander, and evil. He added: "We must overcome 
seditious interests and unite in carrying out the noble mission 
of serving the fatherland with talent, capability, and total 
devotion." 
  The chief of state said: "Democratic institutionalization, 
the state of law, republicanism, and my profound dedication 
demand that I ask my fellow countrymen for the necessary 
sacrifice to win." 
  "This democratic and Colorado government demands respect 
without subservience, discipline without obsequiousness, and 
support without conditions," he said. 
  Wasmosy thanked his fellow party members for the support he 
received on 9 May 1993, adding that this support must increase 
considering the time the party will be responsible for 
governing. "A greater responsibility is needed because before 
the elections the focus was on the party, but today we carry the 
enormous task of being statesman for both the party and for all 
citizens," he stressed. 
  He warned of the possibility of false prophets who may take 
up the republican principles and fly the Colorado banner. 
  Sanabria Cantero expressed the Colorado Party's total 
support 
for Wasmosy's government task and he congratulated party workers 
and campesinos for not following "corrupt union leaders."

  [Excerpt] Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, president of the 
Colorado Party, last delivered an aggressive address during a 
ceremony commemorating his party's victory in the 9 May 1993 
elections. He warned that the "Colorado Party will do anything 
necessary, during any emergency in which we are called, to 
defend the legitimate right of the Colorado Party to govern." 
  The ceremony was held at the Colorado Party headquarters 
with 
the participation of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, ministers, 
and the party's top leadership. Sanabria Cantero said that the 
country is advancing "against what is written and proclaimed 
through incomplete information." 
  He again warned those who speculate "that disorder, chaos, 
and a public lack of tranquility are instruments of 
destabilization, that they will never make the government slip 
nor will they confuse the republican masses who remain firm, as 
is their tradition, in the defense of order and lawfulness no 
matter what they are called to defend." [passage omitted]

  [Text] On the first anniversary of the 9 May 1993 general 
elections, Vice Admiral Eduardo Gonzalez Petit, the commander of 
the Military Forces, sent a note to President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy, the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, yesterday. 
In his note, Vice Adm. Gonzalez Petit told the president that 
the military will follow "his praiseworthy task with complete 
institutional subordination to the political power and with the 
total conviction that his patriotic administration and resolute 
efforts are sure to lead to the full development of democracy, 
and consequently, to the betterment of the standard of living of 
our heroic people." 
  The letter says: "On the occasion of the first anniversary 
of 
your resounding victory in the national elections, which gained 
you the presidency, it is a great honor for me to address Your 
Excellency and to extend to you my most heartfelt and warm 
congratulations on behalf of the generals, senior officers, 
subalterns, auxiliary personnel, non-commissioned officers, 
conscripts, military employees, and warrant officers of the 
Military Forces. It is with deep satisfaction that I express 
our content over the skillful way in which you have conducted 
our glorious Armed Forces, which have as their commander in 
chief a civilian who faithfully addresses his concerns. I wish 
to once again extend my congratulations to Your Excellency, our 
commander in chief, together with my loftiest sentiments of 
esteem and respect."

<F P=106> [Report by Else Ursula Picon including excerpts of recorded </F>
interview with "repentant" MRTA leader Emilio Villalobos Alba, 
also known as "Comrade Celso," place and date not given; from 
the "Panorama" program presented by Guido Lombardi -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Lombardi] This past week Dincote 2 [National 
Counterterrorism Directorate, 2d Department], headed by Colonel 
Juan Gonzalez Sandoval, arrested important MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] leaders. Panorama was able to interview 
one of those arrested, a repentant MRTA member, and in the 
course of the interview he supplied some details about the 
MRTA's internal organization. 
  [Picon] The last man in the arrested group of MRTA members 
did not mean much to anyone: Emilio Villalobos Alba. With his 
arrest, however, Dincote did not arrest just another MRTA 
member. Villalobos' arrest meant that Dincote had arrested Peter 
Cardenas Shultz's successor, that is, the MRTA logistics 
apparatus chief, the chief of the MRTA special forces, and the 
man in charge of the MRTA's international network; a member of 
the MRTA national board, and a member of the MRTA national 
leadership. That is who Emilio Villalobos, also known as 
Comrade Celso, is. 
  Emilio Villalobos, Comrade Celso, joined the MRTA in 1984. 
The police first identified him on 23 December 1985 when Celso, 
as a member of the MRTA hit squad, attacked the Escala Gigante 
shop on Alfonso Ugarte shop, where he was injured. He was able 
to flee, but by August 1986 the police were aware of the attacks 
he had taken part in and they began to seek him. 
  To this point, Comrade Celso's task in the organization had 
been to orient the masses and execute armed actions. All this 
changed, however, on 19 July 1988, when he was arrested and sent 
to serve his sentence at the Castro Castro jail. This is where 
Emilio Villalobos's story begins; how he became a member of the 
MRTA leadership and how eventually he became Peter Cardenas 
Shultz's successor. 
  Panorama was able to interview the protagonist of this 
story: 
Emilio Villalobos, Comrade Celso, who is under arrest today. 
  [Begin recording] [Villalobos] At the time, I held a very 
high position within the MRTA leadership. At the time, the 
leaders included a number of MRTA members and many of them had 
held important posts. 
  [Picon] Such as? 
  [Villalobos] Such as Peter Shultz, Lucero Cumpa, Miguel 
Rincon Rincon, etc. [end recording] 
  [Picon] Given his prison ties, when he left jail on 6 April 
1990, the MRTA selected Villalobos to do important work with one 
of the most important MRTA leaders, Nestor Cerpa Catolini: 
  [Begin recording] [Picon] Were you a member of the 
Metropolitan Committee? 
  [Villalobos] That is right. 
  [Picon] What other posts did you hold within the MRTA? 
  [Villalobos] (?Depending) on different needs, I was assigned 
to the northern region. Later, I took on larger 
responsibilities. [end recording] 
  [Picon] In view of this new task, Peter Cardenas Shultz 
ordered, from jail, that Celso be assigned an undercover 
identity. From that point, Emilio Villalobos, also known as 
Comrade Celso, became Oscar Balderrama Bernedos, a Bolivian 
journalist acting as a PRESENCIA magazine correspondent in Lima. 
  With this undercover identity, Celso, together with Nestor 
Cerpa Catolini, was responsible for planning the most violent 
kidnappings and assassinations of various Peruvian businessmen. 
  [Begin recording] [Villalobos] (?These) deaths (?had to 
with) 
the all-out war we were waging against the Armed and military 
forces. But in no way whatsoever did the MRTA ever support any 
project based on killing Peruvians in an indiscriminate manner, 
or perpetrating actions that would affect the civilian 
population. We were very respectful in this regard. We even 
upheld the Geneva agreements. 
  [Picon] Why, then, did you kill kidnapped victims? There are 
several examples in this regard, such as Ballon Vera, the 
Spanish businessmen, Miyasato, Furukawa, and several others who 
were killed by the MRTA. If the MRTA, as you allege, respects 
human rights and the lives of individuals, why did you kill 
these kidnapped victims? For money? 
  [Villalobos] Among the many businessmen who were taken 
prisoner, you will find several -- and some of them have 
publicly told this to the media -- who have commented on the 
dignified manner in which they were treated... 
  [Picon, interrupting] But there are also many, like 
businessman Ballon Vera, who were savagely killed. 
Unfortunately, they are unable to comment on the tortures they 
endured, but they were killed. 
  [Villalobos] Among the reports we have available, 
unfortunately we do have reports of these incidents. We have 
faced difficult circumstances. But I believe these deaths are 
part of a war, and there are no wars without deaths. This is a 
fact. [passage omitted] 
  [Picon] [words indistinct] military with you? 
  [Villalobos] Well, this would have to be in direct relation 
with the activities I was involved in [words indistinct] both in 
Lima and in the northern region. [end recording] 
  [Picon] Arrogance and cold blood are the traits that 
allowed Villalobos to continue to climb within the MRTA 
leadership. When Dincote 2, headed by Col. Juan Gonzalez 
Sandoval, arrested Peter Cardenas Shultz, Comrade Celso occupied 
all of Cardenas Shultz's posts, mainly to receive all the funds 
obtained from the kidnappings. 
  [Begin recording] [Villalobos] The money is centralized. 
  [Picon] Where? 
  [Villalobos] The national leadership. This money is used as 
a war fund. 
  [Picon] But the MRTA must be aware of what you do with the 
money. 
  [Villalobos] Not really... 
  [Picon, interrupting] No one knows what is done with the 
money? 
  [Villalobos] This is because of the way in which the group 
is 
divided up. But all of the organization's needs are met. [end 
recording] 
  [Picon] These MRTA needs are nothing but brand new cars, 
luxury houses, and expensive restaurants. Dincote arrested many 
MRTA leaders thanks to the ostentatious and luxurious manner in 
which they lived. 
  In addition, Celso was responsible for the MRTA's logistics 
apparatus and for establishing international communications, 
mainly with Hugo Avellaneda Valdes, in France, and with Walter 
Palacios, in Mexico. By then, Celso, already a member of the 
MRTA national leadership, established his base in Barranca, and 
from there he planned to establish a new kidnappings base in 
Arequipa. When the police arrested him on 10 April, Celso had 
already planned the kidnapping of two Arequipa businessmen. 
[passage omitted] 
  Celso was arrested in Lima. But before that, the police 
spotted him entering several houses which turned out to be MRTA 
bases. It is from these houses that the police seized this 
important arsenal. 
  When Dincote agents discovered this arsenal inside an MRTA 
base discovered in Las Flores, they also found a guitar case. 
They were greatly surprised, however, with what they found 
inside the case. What they found inside this simple guitar case 
was the very weapon used by the MRTA to attack buildings such as 
the Peruvian-American Cultural Institute, the U.S. Embassy, and 
the house of ex-Minister Bolona. [passage omitted] 
  All of these crimes were ordered by Emilio Villalobos Alba, 
also known as Comrade Celso, member of the MRTA national 
leadership. But how did those who carried out the orders given 
by this criminal terrorist feel about it? You will now have an 
opportunity to find out what these people feel about the MRTA, 
and why they decided to leave that subversive organization. 
This is the testimony of an MRTA member who repented. 
  [Begin recording] [Picon] What actions were you involved in? 
  [Unidentified repentant MRTA member] I was involved in 
kidnappings and harassment, actions of harassment with rocket 
launchers and rifles, in the capital. The national leadership 
was directly responsible for decisions on the kidnappings. 
  [Picon] How was the money obtained from the kidnappings 
used? 
  [MRTA member] At the beginning, I thought the money obtained 
from the kidnappings was used to keep the armed struggle alive 
on the different fronts in the capital. But many times I 
encountered members in the lower structure, people who worked in 
the unions, in the shantytowns, people who were dying from 
tuberculosis, dressed in rags, and things like that. But there 
were some leaders who had an opportunity to enjoy the money, eat 
in good restaurants like the Haiti, eat pizza, drink beer in the 
Miraflores district or places like that. 
  [Picon] Who did that, for example? 
  [MRTA member] The ones who enjoyed these privileges were 
those in command positions; those who received money within the 
party. 
  [Picon] Why did you do that, why torture, why murder? 
  [MRTA member] We see here what could be an ideological 
decomposition of the MRTA. I do not understand why businessman 
Vera Ballon was tortured, left weighing 49 kg, and then shot. 
There is no excuse for that. 
  [Picon] What is the MRTA becoming? 
  [MRTA member] If the MRTA continues like that it will become 
a criminal group having no other choice than its own 
destruction. [end recording] 
  [Picon] The MRTA has entered its final phase of extinction, 
and Dincote is playing a very important role in this. This 
week, Dincote 2 headed by Col. Juan Gonzalez Sandoval made an 
important capture in the struggle against terrorism.

  [Text] Tingo Maria, 25 Apr -- General Alfredo Rodriguez 
Riveros, chief of the Huallaga Front, said the bodies found 
yesterday buried in a grave in the Shapingo sector (Moyuna) by 
members of the Human Rights Commission of the Democratic 
Constituent Congress belong to two Shining Path "commanders" of 
a group that operates in this zone. He said this was determined 
by the testimony of three repentant Shining Path members who 
were under the command of one of them and also from intelligence 
information. 
  Other military chiefs said the dead were known as "Comrade 
Mardonio" and "Comrade Abel" of the logistical and military 
commands respectively of the so-called 3d Batallion of the 
Moena-Moyuno People's Committee. 
  The body of "Comrade Abel" supposedly belongs to the peasant 
Felix Loyola who, according to his wife and relatives, was a 
coca grower who had his farm in this sector and was shot by 
soldiers when he was leaving the area. 
  Gen. Rodriguez presumes the bodies belong to some of the six 
terrorists killed on 8 April by a militay patrol in a clash in 
another sector of Moyuna, about three to four hours by foot into 
the jungle. He said all the information will be given to 
provincial Prosecutor Carlos Gonzalez Ortiz, who is 
investigating this case to obtain more evidence to clarify the 
killings. 
  Regarding the bones found in the Carmen Alto zone (near the 
port of Moyuna de Anda), he said that according to preliminary 
information, the bones have been there for several years.

  [Text] On 28 April, Ayacucho peasant defense patrol leaders 
stated they are prepared to launch the "final offensive" against 
Shining Path forces in this department, where the Shining Path 
is operating in the Andean mountain range along the border with 
Apurimac Department. 
  Susano Mendoza Preja, mayor of La Quinua and spokesman for 
the peasant defense patrol of Huamanga Province, said "this 
offensive will have better results than Operation Aries 
(currently under way in the Huallaga Valley) because the Shining 
Path will have to deal not only with the Army but with organized 
peasants as well." 
  Mendoza argued that any operation involving the peasants 
would have the advantage of the latter's knowledge of the 
terrain and the ability to immediately mobilize 25,000 people. 
Mendoza told EXPRESO: "We are prepare to fight and do away with 
terrorism once and for all." 
  Mendoza and other peasant leaders, like Donato Sulca 
("Gavilan Command") and Julio Enciso ("Halcon Command"), 
reported that Shining Path armed columns are operating in the 
Andean mountain range along the border between Ayacucho and 
Apurimac Departments. 
  The peasant leaders warned that Shining Path forces have 
regrouped recently and Shining Path units were sighted in Ocros 
District and in rural areas of Andahuaylas. 
  On 17 April, a group of 30 Shining Path militants attacked 
San Juan de Lucanas (on the border with Ica Department) and 
killed five people after destroying public property and several 
interprovincial buses. 
  Peasant defense patrol representatives asked the central 
government to give them sustained logistic support to help them 
fight for peace. They sent a memorandum to political and 
military officials asking for solutions to the legal problems of 
nine peasant defense patrol leaders who are in prison in 
Huamanga (on charges of alleged homicide) and for the pardon for 
peasant leaders who have already been sentenced. 
  The representatives asked for the implementation of Supreme 
Decree 077-DE-092, which grants benefits to members of peasant 
defense patrols in case of death or disablement. They also 
disagreed with the proposal to lift the state of emergency in 
Ayacucho Department because they believe that "peace has not yet 
taken root in Ayacucho."

  [Text] Military analysts agree that an armed confrontation 
between Shining Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement] is "in the making" in the jungle area of Junin 
Department. The analysts added that under the present 
circumstances, there is bound to be a struggle for the control 
of drug trafficking areas in Padre Abad, Ucayali; Oxapampa and 
Gran Pajonal in the Pasco jungle; and in Chachamayo and Satipo 
in the jungle area of Junin Department. 
  The analysts explained that it is essential for the two 
extremist organizations to keep their control over coca-growing 
areas because that is where their dollars come from. This 
income ensures the survival of the two armed groups, and keeps 
them ready for combat. The experts, however, pointed out a 
significant difference between the two groups. 
  The information obtained from a repentant soldier indicated 
that Shining Path leaders keep resources and funds under tight 
control, and issue rations to their men that keep them hungry. 
Shining Path extremists are poorly fed, and get the same food 
ration for months. 
  "Jairo," one of the first repentants who surrendered at the 
Mazamari military base two years ago, made this decision because 
he was tired of the rampant corruption among the leaders. 
According to "Jairo," the "lower ranks" ate corn mash while the 
leaders ate canned food and drank whisky, which they obtained 
from drug traffickers in the jungle area of San Francisco, 
Ayacucho Department. 
  The internal situation of the MRTA is different. The MRTA 
pays salaries to its militants to stop them from running away, 
which turns them into paid mercenaries. 
  Thus, the two groups clearly rely on support from drug 
traffickers, but there is a difference between them. The MRTA 
structure seems to be more fragile. As soon as the flow of drug 
money is cut, the organization will collapse because the 
combatants would refuse to fight if there is no booty to share. 
  The Shining Path is probably not as dependent on drug money 
because the leaders can actually force the soldiers to fight, 
but the involvement is much more deeply rooted. The Shining 
Path is seriously jeopardized by the way in which drugs and drug 
money have corrupted its political and military leaders, who 
some time ago used to take pride in their austerity. 
  According to the sources, when Shining Path militants showed 
up in Padre Abad, fleeing after the defeat of the Mar Rojo 
battalion on the banks of the Huallaga River, and joined other 
Shining Path forces in the province, the MRTA started having 
problems, and must now unleash a sustained offensive. 
  The analysts even predicted that the MRTA will oust the 
Shining Path from Padre Abad Province and will take over Shining 
Path hideouts in the region. The analysts also announced the 
MRTA will try to do the same thing in Oxapampa and Gran Pajonal, 
in the jungle area of Pasco, where the MRTA has a platoon (one 
platoon has between 20 and 30 men), and in Pichis Palcazu. 
Another MRTA platoon is operating in the area attacked a convoy 
with draftees near Villa Rica a few days ago. 
  The analysts explained, however, that the largest MRTA 
contingent is operating in Satiop, Perene, and Parihuanca in the 
jungle area of Junin Department. There, the MRTA has three 
well-armed platoons that have been stopping and robbing vehicles 
along the Marginal Highway and killing people. It would seem 
that these groups manage to blend with the local population 
after their raids. 
  The analysts confirm that the MRTA apparently managed to set 
up an operation in Huancayo to push out the Shining Path, which 
was again trying to extort money from farmers. In fact, on 26 
April the MRTA called a two-day "armed strike" in three jungle 
provinces, according to information received. The Huancayo 
police reported that strike "announcements" were painted on city 
walls. 
  The provinces where the MRTA is trying to compel the people 
to "strike" are Chanchamayo and Satipo in Junin Department, and 
in Oxapampa in Pasco Department. In the past only the Shining 
Path used to organize "armed strikes." 
  Even though certain analysts, whom the news agencies quote, 
seem to believe that this could mean a possible merger of the 
two subversive gangs, everything indicates that at least in the 
central jungle area, a clash between the two groups seems to be 
inevitable.

  [Text] Lima, 9 May (EFE) -- Peruvian drug trafficker 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, also known as "Vaticano," today 
before a congressional committee charged that military officers 
ranked as high as captain were involved in his illegal 
activities in the Upper Huallaga jungle region. 
  "Vaticano's" revelations were disclosed today by Congressman 
Julio Castro Gomez, chairman of the congressional committee on 
drug trafficking, who, along with other members of the 
committee, interrogated the drug trafficker in his cell at the 
Callao Port Naval Base, where he is serving a 30-year sentence. 
  Castro quoted "Vaticano" as saying that he carried out his 
narcotrafficking activities "with the acquiescence and 
collaboration" of personnel ranked as high as captain from the 
Punta Arenas military post in the jungle department of San 
Martin. 
  "Vaticano," who is considered to be the main Peruvian drug 
trafficker, noted that he had received "collaboration and 
protection" from these Army personnel in building a clandestine 
airfield in Campanilla and carrying out his overall drug 
trafficking activities between 1990 and 1992, in exchange for a 
$5,000 payment for each drug shipment. Colombian planes that 
came to pick up cocaine paste were landing at and taking off 
from the Campanilla airfield. 
  "Vaticano" was considered to be the main Peruvian supplier 
for the "Cali cartel." "Vaticano" also told the congressmen that 
civilian authorities, such as the mayor of Campanilla, were 
aware of his activities. 
  According to Castro, "Vaticano" denied allegations that he 
was linked to the Shining Path terrorist gang or that he was 
forced to make payments to the subversive group to be able to 
carry out his drug trafficking operations. Castro added: 
"Vaticano" even noted that some of his men had clashed with the 
terrorists. Castro added that "Vaticano" did not identify the 
officers he claimed to have bribed. 
  Castro reported that "Vaticano" was questioned for more than 
four and a half hours, and he told the committee he had informed 
drug enforcement police and antiterrorist police about his 
connections with military and civilian authorities. 
  "Vaticano" was first sentenced to life by a military court 
on 
charges of treason against the fatherland for having supplied 
weapons and food to the Shining Path. His sentence was reduced 
last week to 30 years in light of evidence that he had not 
participated either in murders or as a leader of the terrorist 
organization. "Vaticano" is also facing a civil lawsuit for his 
involvement in drug trafficking activities.

  [Excerpt] Lima, 10 May (EFE) -- The Peruvian Government's 
decision to submit the 1994 economic program agreed upon between 
the government and the IMF to decision was backed today by all 
Peruvian entrepreneurial and political circles. 
  On 9 May, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori indicated that 
his government would wait at least 10 days for experts to raise 
their proposals to improve the draft of the letter of intent 
before sending it to the IMF. 
  Economist Alejandro Indacochea, an Advanced Business School 
board member, noted that Fujimori's proposal was positive 
"because the publication of such documents had been considered 
taboo by former governments, which guarded them as if they were 
top state secrets." 
  Indacochea pointed out, however, that it would be impossible 
to voice an opinion on the letter of intent unless the annexes 
on the committed economic targets become known, and he asked the 
government to publish them as soon as possible. 
  The economist added that there is a point missing in the 
document "involving the overvaluation of soles against dollars 
and its negative impact on the trade deficit, which has not been 
overcome in four years and must be reversed." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Industry Minister Liliana Canale has stated that as 
a result of the elimination of both subsidies and state 
intervention in the economy, investments in our country will 
total approximately $6 billion over the next five years. 
Emphasizing the significance of an adequate opening toward the 
private sector and toward market forces, she said: "We are 
speaking about a figure that will be five times larger than the 
accrued investment reported up to 1993." 
  In this respect, she said she is pleased to note that the 
government, businessmen, academicians, and politicians agree on 
"a guiding approach to the country's development model that 
should be followed in the short and medium term." 
  Canale noted that China has become the third leading 
investor 
in our country. She added that there is great demand in China 
for products and raw materials that we could sell them if we had 
the adequate scale of production. 
  During a lecture at the Peruvian Center for International 
Studies (Cepei), the industry minister again called upon 
businessmen to redouble their efforts to reach other markets and 
the various trade blocs existing in the world. She emphasized 
the need to reach Asian and European markets with competitive 
prices. 
  Commenting on Peruvian relations with Pacific Rim countries, 
Canale said efforts are being made to promote relations not only 
with China and Japan, but also with other countries because the 
most dynamic economies are located in that area. Regarding 
Peru's geographic location, she said: Our geographic, economic, 
and labor conditions will enable us to rapidly win those major 
markets.

  [Text] Last night, the Democratic Left Movement [MDI] 
inaugurated its first national congress, the central purpose 
being to seek the unity of the country's democratic forces and 
find a path leading to freedom and social justice in Peru. The 
political event started at 1900 in one of the Lima Civic 
Center's spacious auditoriums. 
  The congress was attended by well-known leaders from the 
Peruvian left, some of whom are members of the Democratic 
Constituent Congress (MDI bloc), some of whom work in their 
respective political parties, and others who represent labor or 
independent organizations. It was the first time the congress 
had been attended by MDI delegates and grassroots activists from 
around the country. 
  The MDI appeared in the country's political scene after the 
discrepancies and disagreements within the United Left had 
become increasingly acute. This, in turn, was a consequence of 
the political exhaustion, electoral adversities, party splits, 
and the isolation of the leadership from their grassroots. 
  Last night, Henry Pease, who presided over the MDI First 
National Congress' Organizing Commission, said: "We do not 
believe we are, or say that we are, the saviors of the 
fatherland. But we seek common space to promote programs and 
policies that will benefit all Peruvians, particularly the 
poorest ones." 
  Besides Henry Pease, the congressional executive board was 
made up of the following leaders: Jose Tavara, Oscar Ugarte, 
Carlos Chipoco, Jorge Campos Rey de Castro, Rolando Ames, and 
Manuel Lajo.

  [Text] Yesterday, Army Commander General Nicolas de Bari 
Hermoza Rios said relations between the Armed Forces and the 
International Red Cross are "cordial," and that this 
humanitarian organization "will be able to enter the theater of 
operations in Huanuco when progress is made in the actions being 
taken." 
  Gen. de Bari Hermoza, Army commander and president of the 
Armed Forces Joint Command, made this comment after holding a 
one and a half hour meeting with George Conmino, head of the 
International Red Cross in Peru. The meeting was held from 1030 
to 1155 in General Hermoza's office in the Army General 
Headquarters in San Borja. After the meeting, Hermoza answered 
questions from reporters: 
  [Reporter] General, what issues did you discuss with the 
head 
of the International Red Cross in Peru? 
  [Hermoza] The head of the International Red Cross just came 
to visit. The visit was of the kind frequently made by this 
organization to the Army. The conversation was very cordial, 
and we recognize the important humanitarian work done by this 
organization. 
  [Reporter] Did the president of the Red Cross ask you to 
facilitate a visit to the zone in conflict? 
  [Hermoza] We always do everything we can to help the Red 
Cross fulfill its mission. In the last two years, we have 
granted 55 authorizations to its members to help them fulfill 
their tasks in the country in visiting garrisons, police posts, 
and in meeting with people under arrest. We have facilitated 
all manner of things. The government even authorized them to 
enter a number of prisons where terrorists are serving their 
sentences. 
  [Reporter] Will the Armed Forces Joint Command be able to 
guarantee their visit to the theater of countersubversive 
operations in the Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco? 
  [Hermoza] They have no restrictions. What worries me is 
their security in the areas where the Army is clashing with 
subversives. At any other time, there would not have been any 
restrictions. But as the operations develop, they will be able 
to enter the zone. 
  [Reporter] But they want to visit the site where the clashes 
are taking place to verify if human right violations are 
occurring. 
  [Hermoza] They did not state the need to enter the conflict 
zone, for obvious reasons. Also, for security reasons they 
cannot enter, for the time being. 
  [Reporter] The chief of the Huallaga Front, Antonio 
Rodriguez 
Riveros, questioned the work of the Red Cross and said they leak 
"information" to the terrorist "commands." 
  [Hermoza] There is no evidence of infiltration or leaks. The 
interviews are granted according to the situation in the area of 
conflict. 
  [Reporter] What is the current situation in the Cuchara 
"pocket" in Huanuco? 
  [Hermoza] An evaluation was made and the Huallaga Front 
chief 
reported it. Some policemen were wounded. Some of them were 
evacuated to Lima yesterday. 
  [Reporter] What do you think of the proposal made by 
Congressman Chirinos Soto that you remain as Army general 
commander? 
  [Hermoza] I am thankful to Chirinos for his proposal. I 
would like to tell the people, the media, that the soldiers and 
policemen, beginning with their commanders, are the ones who 
should receive permanent recognition. It is worth noting the 
greatness with which they risk their lives and continue to fight 
for the pacification of the country every day. A commander 
needs only to fight by the side of his soldiers to carry out the 
strategy ordered by the president of the Republic, who is really 
the person leading us toward victory. 
  [Reporter] What is the human rights situation in the zones 
where the clashes between the Army and the terrorists are taking 
place? 
  [Hermoza] There are no violations. The Congressional Human 
Rights Commission and the attorney general have gone to Huanuco. 
The attorney general even appointed a special prosecutor. Any 
investigation falls in the legal field. We have direct and 
smooth communications with the International Red Cross. I would 
like to say that human rights are a strategic need contained in 
all the guidelines of the president of the Republic and of 
national pacification.

  [Text] Yesterday, General Luis Cisneros Vizquerra, retired, 
reaffirmed his criticism of and opposition to senior military 
officials and the government, in stating that the Armed Forces 
are performing the role of a political party for President 
Fujimori, and that they therefore cannot guarantee impartiality 
in the 1995 elections. 
  Cisneros is a retired general who served as interior 
minister 
during the government of General Francisco Morales Bermudez. 
Despite the fact that a military court recently issued a 90-day 
suspended sentence against him, Cisneros yesterday openly 
reaffirmed his disagreement with senior officers of the Armed 
Forces. The Supreme Court of Military Justice sentenced him for 
the military crime of having allegedly "insulted his superiors." 
  In an interview he granted yesterday to television host 
Alfredo Barnechea during his "Live" program, Gen. Cisneros said: 
"The Armed Forces have not only become somewhat like a 
political party for President Fujimori, but commanding officers 
are openly voicing their support for him, thus raising doubts 
about their impartiality in the 1995 elections." 
  Early during the bloody subversive war unleashed by Abimael 
Guzman and his "Shining Path" organization, Gen. Cisneros, 
nicknamed "Gaucho" because he studied in Argentina, stirred up a 
great deal of controversy by upholding draconian ideas about the 
antisubversive strategy. 
  As he did then, Cisneros today still supports an extremely 
tough line in fighting terrorism. His theory is that a "social 
cost" is absolutely inevitable in the war against subversion, in 
thus alluding to civilian casualties and to excesses that may 
occur in the theater of operations. 
  Yesterday, Cisneros blamed senior military officers, namely 
from the Army, for the loss of the spirit of comradeship, 
loyalty, and mutual confidence that should prevail within the 
military institution. He harshly criticized the National 
Intelligence Service [SIN], which he described as a true 
"Gestapo," and regarded SIN members as "the eyes and ears of the 
government who have sowed distrust within the institution." 
Cisneros said: "This means that no trust is being placed in 
commanding officers or that distrust prevails among the rank and 
file." 
  On the political front, he said, "in recent times the Armed 
Forces, and especially the Army, have performed the role of 
political party for President Fujimori." Cisneros said that 
because the president has no political party, he has used senior 
officers to serve his own interests, thus violating 
constitutional provisions. 
  He criticized the senior officers for openly supporting 
Fujimori, and contended that no one could fail to notice that 
this support is designed to obtain Fujimori's reelection. 
Cisneros added that this support has placed the Army in an 
awkward position, to the point that today, the Armed Forces can 
no longer guarantee they will be impartial in the upcoming 
electoral process. 
  Cisneros said: "The Armed Forces should not state their 
position on these issues because they have no reason to do so." 
Nevertheless, he said, senior officers are "flamboyantly" 
conveying their support for the regime. 
  Commenting on the antisubversive offensive launched by the 
Army in the Upper Huallaga and to charges of the murder of 
innocent civilians, Cisneros reaffirmed his ideas about the 
antisubversive war. He said it has been a tremendous error to 
entrust the Armed Forces with the task of engaging in drug 
enforcement operations. Cisneros noted that the Constitution 
has entrusted this task to the police. 
  Commenting on the death of civilians in general terms, he 
said no war is clean; they are all dirty, and that social costs 
are inevitable.

  [Text] Chief Justice Luis Serpa Segura has fully endorsed a 
resolution by the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) to 
postpone the implementation of the new Code of Penal Procedure 
for six months. He noted that this period of time will be used 
to refurbish the infrastructural facilities needed for the code 
to go into effect. 
  Although he did not explicitly say so, Serpa was thus 
directly alluding to an executive branch decree that declared 
all criminal justice buildings to be in state of emergency for 
four months. These facilities will play a leading role in the 
implementation of the new code. 
  Serpa added that the suspension of the implementation of the 
new code will also make it possible to adjust its articles to 
the new Constitution that was approved by referendum on 31 
October 1993. 
  Furthermore, the 43 Lima criminal courts functioning at the 
Justice Palace have not yet been able to move to their new 
offices on the six lower floors of the new building that now 
houses the Attorney General's Office (the former Economy 
Ministry building). This move was ordered precisely to pave the 
way for a better implementation of the new Code of Penal 
Procedure. The 43 provincial criminal prosecutors have, 
however, managed to move to the new offices, and are already 
working in the upper seven floors of the said building. 
  The new code provides that criminal courts, prosecutors, 
their respective clerks, and specialized offices should be 
located in the same building -- such as the one designated by 
the government -- for the purpose of ensuring that justice be 
served promptly and in a timely manner. 
  The Justice Ministry has authorized the judicial branch to 
hire directly, without calling for bids, contractors to renovate 
the floors that will house the criminal courts.

  [Text] In its latest survey, the Peruvian Public Opinion 
Poll (POP) shows that 64 percent of Peruvian voters believe 
Fujimori should seek reelection, while 63 percent of them 
approve of his performance as president. 
  If the 1995 presidential elections were held tomorrow, the 
incumbent president would obtain 49 percent of the votes, while 
Javier Perez de Cuellar would obtain 40 percent. The survey 
also shows that only 28 percent of those polled knew what Perez 
de Cuellar did for a living. 
  The POP survey focuses on the ideas voters have about 
Fujimori and Perez de Cuellar as presidential candidates for 
1995. They regard the incumbent chief executive as "a strong 
person who is better acquainted with Peruvian reality and who is 
better identified with the people." They believe the former UN 
secretary general has "greater international prestige."

<F P=106> [Article by Samuel Blixen] </F>
  [Excerpts] Approximately a month ago, the interior minister 
installed an Anti-Mafia Unit to try, through intelligence work, 
to break up the connection between police officers and Uruguayan 
criminal organizations. These organizations are part of 
international mafia networks dedicated to white slave trading 
and drug trafficking. 
  The classified information being handled by the Interior 
Ministry reveals that mafia infiltration into various domestic 
circles has affected an alarming number of middle- and 
high-ranking police officers. 
  There are numerous indications that organizations dedicated 
to the white slave trade and drug trafficking have developed 
support structures at the neighborhood level and in sports and 
recreational organizations. 
  But these mafias have not enrolled only police officers. 
Police, congressional, and judicial documents indicate that the 
mafias have also ensured the complicity of sports entrepreneurs, 
professional sportsmen, and people in the entertainment 
business. The reports even included the name of one deputy. 
  The evidence of the degree of development and impunity of 
these criminal organizations with international connections has 
alarmed people at the highest levels. It is believed that these 
mafias are trying to create social support bases like those in 
Brazil, Bolivia, and Colombia. In these countries, drug 
traffickers control entire neighborhoods, as well as entire 
lines of production activities. 
  National mafias combine violence, coercion, and corruption 
to 
protect an impunity system that has been characterized as 
"shameless." In this respect, the "total inefficiency" of the 
police organizations responsible for repressing the white slave 
trade in trying to stem the constant "export of prostitutes" is 
considered a key factor in the growing power garnered by 
Uruguayan mafias. 
  Some legislators think the absolute impunity enjoyed by 
"pimps and dealers" ["fiolos"], their intermediaries, and 
contacts with organizations managing the international criminal 
trade constitutes a threat to institutional powers. 
  The creation of the Anti-Mafia Unit is the consequence of 
the 
fear and concern expressed in political circles over the 
increasing levels of corruption provoked by these organizations. 
The considerable international economic power of these groups 
is derived from criminal activity considered to be an 
international "scourge." 
  The information collected during the investigation of some 
concrete cases has confirmed that, in Uruguay, there is an 
interaction between drug trafficking, the white slave trade, and 
contraband. 
  BRECHA learned that the Anti-Mafia Unit has begun to process 
information from various sources, and has launched an 
investigation into the origin of capital that permits some 
individuals to enjoy a lifestyle not in accordance with their 
"official" incomes. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  War on Mafias </H5>
  The official inability to act, the reiteration of classified 
reports, and the need to face the power of the mafias has forced 
the Human Rights Committee to take the initiative to coordinate 
efforts in this area. At the beginning of March, it was 
estimated that the situation was extremely serious and out of 
control. Committee members held several meetings with Interior 
Minister Raul Iturria and Interior Under Secretary Juan Luis 
Storace to demand an effective offensive against criminal 
structures and the police protection they enjoy. The decision to 
create the Anti-Mafia Unit was the result of these closed-door 
meetings. There was a tacit agreement between the ministry and 
the committee not to hinder the investigations, no matter who is 
involved. 
  The unit is made up by three high-ranking officials whose 
backgrounds have assured and satisfied the legislators. The 
unit will be directly subordinated to the interior minister. 
One high-ranking official will operate in the administrative 
field, a second will be responsible for international relations, 
and the third will move in the field of police intelligence. 
(BRECHA will omit the names of these officials and the names of 
individuals suspected of being involved in illegal activates, 
witnesses, and those who denounced the illegal acts, for obvious 
reasons and so as not to hinder the investigations under way.) 
  At first it was said that the government decision might 
imply 
an action similar to the "Clean Hands Operation" now under way 
in Italy. That was allegedly the initial idea, but Minister 
Iturria decided to keep a low profile. The minister told BRECHA 
that despite the existence of elements implicating police 
offices with the mafias, "it is difficult to obtain proof 
through administrative investigations." Besides, the minister 
intends to act cautiously "in order not to affect the entire 
police institution, which is indispensable to any 
administration." Officially, Minister Iturria prefers to face 
the offensive against organized crime with a "reorganization" 
that will place the investigation and repression of the 
so-called "international crimes" under his portfolio's 
jurisdiction. An expression of that reorganization is the 
decision to move the intelligence, narcotics, and Interpol 
departments from under the jurisdiction of the Montevideo Police 
Department. 
  Other officials think the Interior Ministry will not be able 
to destroy the mafia organizations without an in-depth attack 
against police corruption. "Otherwise those involved in the 
white slave trade and drug trafficking will continue to act with 
impunity," a deputy told BRECHA. The deputy said he was willing 
to wait a reasonable time for results before proposing other 
measures.

  [Excerpts] Montevideo, 9 May (EFE) -- Cardiologist Roberto 
Canessa, 42, who survived the Andean tragedy 20 years ago, has 
promised "new winds" will blow through Uruguayan politics. He 
founded the "Blue Party" and will run in the 29 November 
election. 
  Canessa and 122 citizens founded the party and today, will 
start formal steps to register it at the Electoral Court. 
[passage omitted] At least seven presidential candidates will 
run in the 29 November election. 
  The ruling National Party (White Party) has become the most 
divided. Four different candidates have already announced their 
candidacies; former Interior Minister Juan Andres Ramirez, who 
is preferred by President Luis Alberto Lacalle among three 
possible candidates; Alberto Volonte, current head of the state 
electricity company; Carlos Julio Pereyra, historic party 
leader; and current Vice President Gonzalo Aguirre. 
  The Colorado Party, which leads the surveys with a 
seven-point advantage over the leftist coalition Broad Front and 
10 points over the "White" Party, has two candidates. 
  Former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti, representing the 
center, has a strong possibility of winning because he is 
supported by 76 percent of his party members. The second 
candidate is former President Jorge Pacheco Areco, a right wing 
leader. 
  The leftist coalition Broad Front will run with a single 
candidate, current Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vazquez. 
  The fourth block in Congress, the social democratic Party 
for 
the Government of the People, which has seven percent of the 
votes, will not present a presidential candidate because its 
leader, Senator Hugo Batalla, has closed a political agreement 
with former President Sanguinetti. 
  Electoral laws in Uruguay do not limit the number of 
candidates because voters vote for a party, and the candidate 
with most votes within that party becomes president. 
  Canessa will probably run for president representing the 
Blue 
Party. He has always said he would like to run for president.

  [Text] Trinidad (Uruguay), 8 May (EFE) -- Today, Alberto 
Volonte, UTE [General Administration of State Electric Power and 
Telephones] executive board chairman, became the fourth 
presidential candidate aspiring to succeed President Luis 
Alberto Lacalle. He will stand as National Party (Blanco Party) 
candidate in the general elections. 
  Some 600 "Blanco" leaders officially proclaimed him during a 
rally in the city of Trinidad, located 190 km northeast of 
Montevideo. Volonte did not participate in this rally as he is 
banned from engaging in partisan politics while he holds a post 
within the state's autonomous agency. 
  The new presidential candidate from the ruling party will 
resign from his post as UTE executive board chairman when the 
momentum for the 29 November elections, in which the national 
government, lawmakers, and municipal authorities will be chosen, 
gathers steam. 
  Volonte had been discarded by President Lacalle, who 
hand-picked his former Interior Minister Juan Andres Ramirez as 
his successor. Volonte was proclaimed by a splinter group that 
broke with the government's top leaders. 
  Volonte's candidacy within the Blanco Party should be added 
to those of Vice President Gonzalo Aguirre, who was proclaimed 
candidate in Montevideo last week, and Senator Carlos Julio 
Pereyra, leader of the second largest faction within the ruling 
party who has taken a different line from Lacalle, especially 
with regard to economic policy. 
  In Uruguay, political parties may field several candidacies, 
which according to the Elections Law, the party is elected first 
and then the candidate who receives the most votes within the 
winning party. 
  As for the Colorado Party, the main opposition party, the 
candidacies of former Presidents Julio Maria Sanguinetti, who 
heads public opinion polls in voters' preferences for president, 
and Jorge Pacheco Areco, leader of the right wing, have already 
been confirmed. It is also believed that Jorge Batlle, a 
three-time candidate for president, will also run. The Broad 
Front, a coalition of leftist parties, will field only one 
presidential candidate, Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vazquez. 
  Public opinion surveys show that the Colorado Party is the 
favorite choice of voters, with 34 percent, followed by the 
Broad Front with 27 percent and the Blanco Party with 24 percent.
