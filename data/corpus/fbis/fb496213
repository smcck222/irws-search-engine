<F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Rospigliosi: "Institutions Adrift"] </F>
  [Text] Two years now since the 5 April coup d'etat, and 
almost four since the start of Alberto Fujimori's 
administration, many achievements and many failures have been 
placed and weighed on the scale of evaluations. These have 
ranged from the decrease in inflation and terrorist actions to 
the president's authoritarianism. But very little has been said 
of what is perhaps the decisive measure by which a regime can be 
judged, namely, the state of the institutions. A careful 
examination of a few of our institutions may help in arriving at 
this judgment. 
<H5>  The Judiciary </H5>
  Following the coup d'etat, the government acted in a totally 
discretionary manner, dismissing those it wanted to rid itself 
of and appointing those it felt like appointing. Then a Panel of 
Honor, appointed by the government itself, carried out an 
evaluation and appointed a new Supreme Court. In sum, a 
reorganization was made short work of by exercising powers that 
no democratic government ever had. The result is devastating. 
  It is devastating not only because of unusual cases like 
that 
of the Cantuta Law, in which meddling by other powers clearly 
demonstrates the subordination of the judiciary, or that of the 
unconstitutional appointment of Miss Nelida Colan as the 
nation's attorney general, owing to her well-known relationship 
with the administration, but because the functioning of the 
judiciary continues to be the same or worse than before: slow, 
inefficient, corrupt. Any citizen who through misfortune falls 
into its net becomes only too aware of this. 
<H5>  Congress </H5>
  Made exactly to measure for the regime, its characteristics, 
prerogatives, and limitations were all decided by the regime 
itself. And the regime is able to count on an absolute majority 
to control the structure it has created. Congressional oversight 
is a complete nullity, since not a single investigation 
concerning the period of the present administration--which is 
what matters--has produced any result whatever. Even 
investigations concerning previous administrations--which the 
present government seeks to discredit--have amounted to nothing 
of any consequence. 
  The Constitution created by this Congress is a travesty that 
is violated by the government itself, and that today, less than 
five months after its promulgation, requires immediate 
amendments, such as that of the wretched Habeas Data. As for its 
legislative accomplishment, it is difficult to remember anything 
remarkable. 
  And from the political point of view, it remains completely 
subordinated to Fujimori, to the Armed Forces' leadership, and 
to anyone who wields a modicum of power. 
<H5>  The Police </H5>
  The government or, better said, the SIN [National 
Intelligence Service] and the Army leadership took control of 
the Ministry of Interior on 28 July 1990. Their first step was 
to remove the minister and reorganize the institution. Their 
last step was to deal the coup de grace to the DINCOTE 
[Counterterrorism Directorate], and begin its dismantlement on 
December 1992, immediately after the capture of Abimael Guzman. 
  Today the Police as an institution are afflicted by the same 
ills of yore, only modified and amplified: low salaries, faulty 
equipment, demoralization, corruption, inefficiency. Up to a 
certain point, the institution has begun being supplanted by 
night watchmen. 
<H5>  Armed Forces </H5>
  Even though their morale and their image improved after the 
capture of Guzman, their professionalism and their constituted 
authority have been severely compromised. Politicization of 
command, expulsion or retirement of many of their best officers, 
factionalism, the system of internal espionage that corrodes 
camaraderie and creates a mistrust bordering on paranoia, have 
brought the Armed Forces to a situation of dangerous 
fragmentation. To these must be added the penetration of drug 
trafficking, a peculiar and extremely dangerous type of 
corruption that is not being held in check. 
  The foregoing list of institutions is not by any means 
exhaustive. It includes neither municipalities, nor ministries, 
nor the diplomatic service, nor other public agencies; but it 
exemplifies the situation. 
  The noticeable improvements in SUNAT [National Tax 
Administration Superintendency] and a few in IPSS [Peruvian 
Institute of Social Security]--the dismantlement of which is, on 
the other hand, being sought--are not even remotely sufficient 
to compensate for the government's systematic work of corroding 
the institutions. 
  The importance of solidly-based institutions is paramount in 
two respects. First, as to the long-term outlook, they are the 
essential prerequisites to the modernization of a country. U.S. 
political expert Samuel Huntington cites the 
institutionalization process as the determinative factor in the 
transition from a traditional society to a modern one without 
falling into chaos and disintegration. "A government with a low 
institutionalization level is not only weak; it is also bad," 
says Huntington. This is because, among other reasons, "a 
society in which institutions are weak lacks the necessary 
capability to contain the excess of personal and parochial 
ambitions," and because a simple political system that depends 
upon a single individual "is also less stable." 
  And second, institutions are a key factor in determining the 
success or failure of the processes involved in a return to 
democracy. As the Argentine Guillermo O'Donnell has stated, the 
transition that has taken place in Latin America, from 
authoritarian regimes to governments elected through clean 
elections, requires a second transition, from those governments 
to democratic governments. According to O'Donnell, this second 
transition has not happened yet, except in countries that had a 
developed institutional system prior to the establishment of the 
dictatorships: Chile and Uruguay. The rest are still mired in 
uncertainty. 
  Although today the merry beneficiaries of Fujimorism may not 
care two hoots about institutionalized values, the consequences 
for the future of the country will be far-reaching.

<F P=106> [Report by Daisy Torres from the "Extravision" Newscast] </F>
  [Text] On the morning of 11 May at Radio Ya studios, former 
President Daniel Ortega answered journalists' questions. During 
his visit to Radio Ya today, Daniel Ortega explained that he 
hasn't resigned the presidential candidacy because the FSLN has 
not nominated him yet. He said he never had any aspirations for 
any post. 
  [Begin Ortega recording] The FSLN has not nominated me. Had 
the FSLN said: our candidate is Daniel Ortega or any other 
person, then I could have resigned. However, I have not 
resigned. I simply said what my revolutionary behavior should 
be. I have no aspirations for any post. [end recording] 
  The FSLN secretary general would not discount the 
possibility 
that the FSLN would strike an alliance with another party, 
except possibly with Mayor Arnoldo Aleman's PLC [Liberal 
Constitutionalist Party], because it is a Somocist stronghold. 
  [Begin Ortega recording] The main thing is to remain 
receptive to a policy of alliances. We must also find the right 
time to strike an alliance. I believe alliances are a necessity 
in forming a government of national unity. I think it is 
paramount in promoting [words indistinct], because it is the 
only thing that can give this country stability, hope, and a 
future. [end recording] 
  He also talked about the need for a government of national 
unity condensed in a program that will listen to people's hopes 
for solutions to socioeconomic problems. 
  [Begin Ortega recording] I believe forging an alliance with 
several socioeconomic sectors is essential because these 
organized sectors -- namely unions, workers, and producers -- 
are strong. Producers are organized under UNAG [National Union 
of Farmers and Cattlemen] and Cosep [Higher Council of Private 
Enterprise]. Workers are organized under the CPT [Permanent 
Workers Congress] and other organizations like the Nicaraguan 
Workers Federation. Thus, there is a large number of organized 
producers and workers interested in the stability of the country 
and aware of the need for consensus. I believe this consensus 
must and can be reached through a program for national unity. 
[end recording] 
  To allegations from a Sandinist faction that is accusing him 
of resorting to violent methods, the former president replied: 
  [Begin Ortega recording] The FSLN cannot be divided into 
violence and nonviolence because the FSLN is a political 
organization that makes decisions binding all party members. We 
are not a group of people where everyone makes his own 
decisions; we are a political force that must have a unified 
position. [end recording]

  [Text] Leon -- Henry Ruiz, a member of the national 
directorate of the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN], 
said yesterday that his party must "move away from internal 
struggles" and immediately begin working on winning the 1996 
election, including the process to select a candidate. Time is 
working against the party's electoral prospects. 
  Ruiz said that "the idea of selecting a presidential 
candidate at this time is premature. In my view, however, those 
who believe we should make that selection in 1995 are also 
mistaken." Ruiz spoke before 180 Sandinists during a party 
meeting in Leon. 
  Ruiz, who has been mentioned as a candidate for FSLN general 
secretary, said: "If my becoming a candidate will serve to unite 
the party, then I will accept. I cannot agree to say, however, 
that having two or more candidates would affect FSLN unity." 
  The FSLN treasurer expressed concern over the fact that "we 
are spending time on this discussion, while our political 
contender is quickly gaining strength." He stressed that 
"losing again in 1996 would mean the end of Sandinism as we know 
it." The Sandinist leader said: "There is no time to organize 
another congress." We must begin the task of organizing from 
the ground up, so as to inspire the popular support we will need 
in 1996. 
  The meeting was led by Leon Mayor Luis Felipe Perez, Deputy 
Doris Tijerino, and Fanor Herrera, the FSLN political secretary 
in Leon. 
  To start selecting a presidential candidate in 1995 "would 
drag us into an internal debate. The Enhanced Structural 
Adjustment Facility [ESAF] is already in motion, and I doubt the 
Congress will go back on the decision it took at its last 
meeting to disapprove the plan," Ruiz explained. He continued 
by saying: "That decision, however, does not say how to counter 
those economic and political formulas. We must move on to the 
next task: What national plan should the FSLN work on and 
develop for what comes after the elections?" 
  Ruiz affirmed that it is necessary to begin the process of 
selecting teams and people, comparing them, and seeking new 
alliances with the people who are bound to approach us in search 
of specific posts and responsibilities with the new government. 
  In his analysis, he stressed the need for the party to act 
openly. "If we are late in doing so, we will end up in an image 
game with our own militants. The first thing they will say is 
that we have just finished a congress during which we decided to 
act one way and that now we are rearranging things. We need 
clarity." 
  In addressing congressional sovereignty, he said that "the 
delegates will have the responsibility of reviewing the benefits 
of FSLN party modernization or renewal, considering the historic 
responsibility of dividing or uniting the party, and, before the 
people, deciding on rising to power within a short time." 
  According to Ruiz, the FSLN must aspire to a power "not of 
minorities but of majorities, and, thus, it must have national 
consensus. That is why a national proposal is needed." He 
cited the example of agriculture, saying that there is no 
Sandinist proposal on the topic. Ruiz called upon the 
Sandinists to "heal the injuries and erase the memories of the 
war in order to be able to build a new nation." To open the 
doors of the FSLN to all the politicians in the rural sectors 
is, in his opinion, "the modernization and renewal of the FSLN." 
  Ruiz called for "finding politically feasible solutions that 
will strengthen the cohesion and unity of Sandinism." "If the 
discussion is insufficient, if we are unable to solve all the 
issues through this means, and if we only have the political 
solution to preserve unity during the next two years in order to 
tackle the 1996 elections, it would be a pity not to accept it. 
It would be necessary to accept it because, if not, we face 
fragmentation and the prospect of not achieving power," Ruiz 
stated. 
  According to the FSLN treasurer, the party's internal debate 
process "is showing that several issues that we initially 
thought would weaken us -- such as opening the doors of 
Sandinism -- have [not] been so contentious." Ruiz considered 
the possibility "that this process could, perhaps, end up in a 
political discussion rather than an ideological debate." He 
added that, in his opinion, the political solution should be 
implemented prior to the congress "without confabulations, 
unprincipled conciliations, or artificial commitments."

<F P=106> [Report by Noel Irias] </F>
  [Text] Henry Ruiz, member of the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front [FSLN], yesterday agreed to run for the 
position of Secretary General of the FSLN. He said he is 
willing "to work for the FSLN's cohesion, to work with his best 
fellow party members as a team to encourage the rank and file, 
and to create a group that can lead us and the people to 
office." This would be the first time in the FSLN's history 
that the organization's top leader is elected by a secret and 
direct vote from among several candidates. 
  In an extensive public letter, Ruiz said he decided to run 
for several reasons, including that "there is excessive 
polarization of opinion" in the FSLN and unity is needed for an 
essential renovation "to determine the new strategy to take 
office." 
  Ruiz, who for the first time was publicly proposed as 
candidate by Doris Tijerino, an experienced FSLN member, had 
said he would consider whether or not his candidacy contributes 
to the party's unity. He did not accept the candidacy 
explicitly, however. 
  In addition, Ruiz said: "Most of my fellow National 
Sandinist 
Directorate members favor a particular trend, an action that 
impairs their fairness in the debate and their objectiveness in 
political communication." He also argued: "The new 
office-taking strategy requires people's consensus to be on our 
side. The strategy demands a new political approach." 
  "The 1996 victory implies restoring the lost confidence in 
the people. This restoration starts right at our homes," he 
said in his letter. He added: "Our people's democratic process 
demands changes in Sandinism's traditional perception." 
<H5>  I Have No Personal Ambitions </H5>
  The current FSLN treasurer also said: "The truth is that I 
do 
not covet power. Such ambitions, even if they are legitimate, 
frequently prevent people from assessing the scenario in its 
true perspective." 
  Over the weekend, Daniel Ortega, current FSLN secretary 
general, said the fact that several members run for the position 
could cause division in the party. In his letter, Ruiz 
disagreed with this view: "Such a remark runs against the 
variables that encompass the FSLN's modernization." 
  In addition to expressing his reasons for agreeing to run, 
Ruiz assessed the FSLN's situation. Among other things, Ruiz 
said that division in the FSLN could be caused, not by a 
measured debate, but by "intolerance, inflexibility, fanaticism, 
the use of pejorative terms, the negation of criticism as a 
method of investigation, and bias as a tool to bend wills." 
  "Sandinism's present problem is not whether or not leftists, 
centrists, or rightists coexist in the FSLN, or whether we are 
right on course or have strayed from ideological parameters," he 
said. 
  According to Ruiz, the challenge the FSLN must meet is this: 
"To uphold principles and to enforce practical ways to heal the 
wounds that war left on our people. To undertake, with all the 
forces of the country, the lofty task of raising society's 
material foundation to improve people's standard of living." He 
also said that his problem has been "to be member of a party 
that had a consistent political position in the past but that no 
longer has this position." 
<H5>  Only One Way Out: Victory </H5>
  "Sandinism requires a clear-cut strategy at present. Today's 
strategy is defined by the popular consensus as established 
through the direct and secret vote at the ballot boxes," Ruiz 
said. Therefore, "1996 is decisive for the future of 
Sandinism. If we win, Sandinism will survive. There is no 
dilemma, only one way out: Victory." 
  Ruiz sternly warned his fellow party members: "There is no 
time to choose a course according to political inclinations. The 
Sandinists of today are in the presence of the Sphinx' enigma: 
Either we succeed or we are sentenced to oblivion." About the 
leadership crisis in his party, Ruiz said: "The current 
leadership is in crisis. Today's National Directorate is not 
different from the one we knew, from the one I knew. It is not 
the one that the lowliest people conceived and became familiar 
with. We are surrounded by facts and fantasy." 
  Ruiz' candidacy has been supported, by among others, deputy 
Doris Tijerino, Col Javier Pichardo, retired, and Luis Enrique 
Figueroa, FSLN political secretary in Chontales department.

<F P=106> [Interview with FSLN member Julio Lopez Campos by Walter </F>
Lacayo Guerra; place and date not given; first paragraph is EL 
SEMANARIO introduction] 
  [Text] Though Julio Lopez Campos says he does not belong to 
an internal Sandinist Front faction, it is inevitable that many 
of his party comrades identify him as one of the "ideologues of 
the orthodox faction or Pikin group," as the Sandinist 
Democratic Left Discussion Forum is called. In July 1993 his 
signature appeared on that famous "Document of the 29," which 
called upon the Sandinist party leadership to take a clear 
position opposing Violeta de Chamorro's government. Six months 
later, in January 1994, he attended a meeting of about 50 
members of the Pikin Guerrero Union School, which some members 
of the National Directorate also attended. Here the Discussion 
Forum or faction to which he belongs was formed. Julio Lopez 
Campos has agreed to answer our questions. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] You are one of the promoters of a faction 
called Sandinist Left. What does that mean? Is not 
the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] itself a party of 
the left, entirely composed of people on the left? 
  [Lopez Campos] First of all, we are not a Sandinist Front 
faction. If you check the public statements of the Democratic 
Left Discussion Forum, we have never claimed to be a faction. As 
the name clearly indicates, we are a discussion forum, that is, 
a large group of Sandinist comrades who are promoting democratic 
debate within the FSLN structures. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What do you mean by faction? 
  [Lopez Campos] Faction? The only faction here is the one led 
by our comrades Sergio Ramirez and Luis Carrion, with an 
alternative proposal for the FSLN, developed with the clear 
intention of offering an alternative and renovating proposal for 
Sandinism. That is a faction. The Democratic Left Discussion 
Forum is not a faction; it only promotes debate among comrades. 
On the other part of your question, we believe Sandinism is 
revolutionary; historically, the FSLN has been the vanguard in 
this country, it has been the greatest expression of the 
Nicaraguan left. But that fact should not automatically lead to 
the conclusion that all Sandinists are necessarily on the left, 
and that we all hold revolutionary positions. Within Sandinism 
there have appeared some comrades who claim to be centrists. 
That is part of the present situation in the FSLN. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] The Sandinist Front is an electoral party 
and 
the 1996 elections are--as the saying goes--just around the 
corner. In your opinion, what should the FSLN do to win back the 
majority it has lost? 
  [Lopez Campos] The FSLN must evaluate its history and the 
1990 election results objectively and fairly, so it can have its 
feet firmly planted on the ground to handle the work it must do. 
That, I believe, is where some of our problems stem, for the 
record of what the Sandinist Front has done is not being 
considered carefully and equitably in terms of the 1990 election 
defeat. There are some very prejudiced views; people want to 
continue seeing us as an exclusive Sandinist Front. During the 
war the FSLN did have to take specific steps to promote extreme 
cohesiveness on the part of its forces, which generated the 
image of an exclusive internal party, but if we look at the 
party structures now, we will find that in the party's 
operational areas there are absolutely no exclusive or 
authoritarian attitudes. Just the opposite is true. I believe it 
is important to portray the FSLN accurately, and that is the 
first step in being able to position ourselves correctly to do 
our jobs. In this context, access to the government is not going 
to come about through arms, but elections. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] The party program is one basic element for a 
party to win elections, but so is its presidential candidate. 
How do you think the FSLN should select its candidate? 
  [Lopez Campos] I am absolutely convinced that the FSLN has 
to 
return to office by electoral means, and so it must reaffirm its 
historic mission. In a country in which 80 percent of the 
population has an income of less than $200 a month, obviously 
the most suitable program for Sandinism must be based on the 
needs and interests of these large masses of campesinos, young 
people, women, the unemployed, and the workers. A party that 
wants to obtain the support of the masses must necessarily have 
a popular mission; if it does not, it cannot claim to lead the 
struggles and represent the interests of the masses. I do not 
see how it could bring to the next elections the forces needed 
to get the results we have to obtain. Sandinism arose with the 
aim of creating profound transformations in Nicaraguan society. 
In this phase it was through the vote, but Sandinism has not 
restricted, nor can it restrict its political work within formal 
institutional confines. These struggles cannot be limited solely 
to the four established branches of government, even though 
there may be some comrades who believe that is possible. What 
can be done about the arbitrary evictions ordered by the courts? 
The FSLN has to organize to defend the interests of all those 
families. We have no other alternative, even though that may 
mean clashing with the forces of law. What can be done in the 
rural areas of Matagalpa and Jinotega where the lives of our 
Sandinist comrades have been threatened? I am one of the 
militants who say that in that area the FSLN must take the lead 
to protect the lives of our Sandinist comrades who have been 
threatened. This places us at odds with the strictly legal 
order, but that is not important to me. What matters most to me 
is the lives of the Sandinists in that area. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Let us get back to the question. What 
mechanism should be used to select the FSLN's presidential 
candidate? 
  [Lopez Campos] In the Discussion Forum, we act in the 
context 
of what was decided by the Sandinist Front. That is why I insist 
that we are not a faction. In the FSLN, selecting the candidate 
for 1996 is not on the agenda. That is not the reason for 
convening the Extraordinary Congress. This congress is being 
convened to discuss the program and the statutes. Absolutely 
nothing is planned about candidacies. We believe it is too early 
to introduce the issue of candidacies when we have still not 
resolved the problem of our new identity. In my opinion, Sergio 
(Ramirez) made an extremely grave political mistake when at the 
end of last year he and his comrades decided to give an 
electoral emphasis to what they had been doing, by introducing 
the dynamics of the presidential candidacy. In fact, that 
faction was working inside the FSLN and to some extent, the 
Discussion Forum arose as a reaction to that faction that had 
been active without publicly acknowledging its existence. They 
could have continued to promote the policy they wanted. All that 
was healthy and positive. That is no crime, there is no problem 
with that. But when they decided to combine their political work 
and start to identify an election slate, including possible 
deputies--because they had talked of candidacies, and some were 
talking about "possible positions" in the future 
government--then we said: those comrades are making a very 
serious mistake. In saying this, I am not censuring the 
legitimate right that any comrade has, and some have more than 
others. In my opinion, Sergio has every right to aspire to be a 
candidate for president of the Republic, but I do feel it was a 
political mistake to have started to work with a view toward 
candidacies for 1996, when what is on Sandinism's agenda now is 
solving its internal problems and developing its program, its 
statutes, and its new identity. So my answer is that it is too 
soon to talk about candidacies. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Sincerely, you have never thought about who 
might be the right candidate for the Sandinist Front? 
  [Lopez Campos] Yes, I have thought about that...one 
difference between an electoral and a revolutionary party is 
that revolutionaries organize to fight in an ongoing manner. 
Their ultimate objective is the election, and in the meantime, 
they face struggles every day. Only a combative front that goes 
to the neighborhoods, to the streets, to the fields, and to the 
mountains can help us to win back the masses of the people. 
Later, we will work out the election issue more easily. I think 
a slate that weakens the front, that splits it, would not be 
viable. I would not even reject a candidate who might not be in 
our party; we might form an alliance for the elections. The 
candidate could also be someone from the front who is not a part 
of its leadership structures, someone like Mariano Fiallos, who 
is not a leader of Sandinism, but who has great prestige and 
authority. There is a full array of possibilities. It is typical 
of electoral political processes that when you want to get rid 
of someone, you toss his hat into the ring early, and he will be 
sure to burn out. In my opinion, that is another mistake Sergio 
made. He began his own process of self-destruction. His latest 
positions are creating friction and a lack of consensus in the 
Sandinist Front, and that affects him as a leader. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Moving on to the Atlantic Coast election 
results. Could you comment on that? 
  [Lopez Campos] In all honesty, I am waiting to hear the 
evaluation made by our Atlantic Coast comrades. Sometimes we in 
the Pacific area are very arrogant, and the truth is that the 
Atlantic Coast is a very special situation. There they have what 
does not exist in the Pacific, and the decisive factor is the 
ethnic problem. The truth of the matter is that we Sandinists in 
general do not know that situation very well. So the first thing 
we have to see is how the people from the coast view the 
situation, and see how we feel about their evaluation. And, 
since I am speaking to EL SEMANARIO, I want to say that Sergio 
made an overhasty evaluation of the Atlantic Coast results 
without first knowing the official views of the comrades. I am 
sure support for the Atlantic Coast elections has not become a 
priority issue in either the leadership of the front or the 
Sandinist Assembly. I would rather wait for their evaluation 
before expressing an opinion. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] In general, what is your opinion of the 
debate among Sandinists, and the strong dissent that offends 
some party members? 
  [Lopez Campos] Well...we have to be open to an intense 
debate, and the debate among Sandinists about the nature of the 
matters we have to discuss must be a firm, impassioned debate 
with strong convictions, but that should in no way lead us to 
exclusive attitudes and terms that destroy the fraternity that 
should exist among Sandinists. I believe it would be a mistake 
not to admit that there have been faults on all sides. Similar 
or worse damage is done to the debate not only by one who speaks 
in extremely frank language, which may be rude, and by one who 
wields his words as skillfully as a surgeon's scalpel, making 
cuts and deep wounds without those wounds being perceptible to 
everyone. There has been some of that in this debate. There are 
some comrades who have the ability and skill to open wounds 
without them being apparent to everyone, and there are some who 
resort to rough language. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What do you think the FSLN's relations with 
the U.S. Government should be? 
  [Lopez Campos] The U.S. ambassador stated in EL SEMANARIO 
that history cannot be repeated. People who forget their own 
history are people who do not deserve respect. The United States 
will respect us if it sees that we are consistent with ourselves 
and our history, and with our healthy intention of having 
friendly relations with it. We did not attack the United States. 
It was the United States who has attacked us throughout our 
modern history, and we cannot forget that. Nor can that be the 
starting point for maintaining a position of friction and 
hostility. I do not know any Sandinist who thinks that he can 
conduct Sandinist politics by seeking confrontations with the 
United States. I do not know a single one. Some points that 
Sergio has been making have greatly displeased me. In his 
statements to EL PAIS, in his zeal for strengthening his 
proposals for renewal, to which he is fully entitled, he has 
been distorting his diagnosis of reality and dwelling on an 
apocalyptic image of the nation's future, saying that the 
tragedy will be to be torn between radical Sandinism, on one 
side, and Arnoldo Aleman's extremism on the other. In that 
situation, says Sergio, the prospect is chaos, and so we need to 
converge toward the center of the Nicaraguan political spectrum. 
Honestly, I say I do not see where Sergio gets that extremist 
and radical Sandinism. It seems to me that he is trying to 
strengthen his own position by using that image or invoking that 
"horrific danger."

<F P=106> [Interview with FSLN member Ernesto Castillo by Walter </F>
Lacayo Guerra; in the library of his home; date not given; first 
three paragraphs are EL SEMANARIO introduction] 
  [Text] Upon the victory of the Sandinist revolution he was 
appointed and sworn in by the JGRN [National Reconstruction 
Government Junta] as attorney general. He then became the "great 
confiscator" from the Somoza family and their allies with the 
promulgation of the now internationally famous Decrees 3 and 38. 
He will never regret having applied them vigorously. 
  He is the father of eight, one of whom--Ernesto Castillo 
Salaverry--died during the September 1978 uprising, fighting the 
National Guard with the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation 
Front] guerrillas. He was a member of the old Sandinist Assembly 
that was dissolved at the end of the first FSLN Congress in July 
1991. 
  Ernesto Castillo, who for five years (1985-90) served as the 
Sandinist government's ambassador to the USSR, now teaches at 
the UCA [Central American University] Law School, as he did from 
1960 to 1970. In the library of his home he answered our 
questions, one by one. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] You signed the document "For a Sandinism 
Restored to the Masses." Is not that faction a sort of Sandinist 
intellectuals' movement? 
  [Castillo] Not so. Both documents, ours and the one released 
by the Democratic Left, were prepared by intellectuals. Julio 
Lopez Campos, for example, is an intellectual who is a member of 
the Democratic Left, just as Sergio Ramirez is an intellectual. 
It is by no means correct to say this is a movement of 
intellectuals. These are people with different views on the 
Front's leadership. Now, of course, to discuss and draft a 
document, you have to know how to read, write, and think. So in 
that sense, every document is prepared by intellectuals. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Your faction represents social democracy in 
the FSLN? 
  [Castillo] I believe such labels are a source of ridiculous 
embarrassment. Some people are now embarrassed to be reminded 
that they were Marxist-Leninists or communists, when in the past 
they shouted that with great pride. Those are only terms that 
become fashionable and then suddenly people are stigmatized with 
those labels. We should see who will be more offended, a person 
called a Marxist-Leninist or a social democrat. Those purely 
formal terms should not concern anyone. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] It has been said that your faction was born 
with an electoral goal in mind: to launch Sergio Ramirez as a 
presidential candidate, and the other supporters want to be 
candidates for deputies and municipal officials. 
  [Castillo] That all seems ridiculous to me. A person simply 
has to read the document to realize that it represents a large 
number of revolutionaries who are questioning internal 
situations in the Sandinist Front. At no time do they support 
the candidacy of Sergio or anybody else, even though they have 
that right, for we all have the right to make decisions about 
candidacies. But that is not what we are concerned with now. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] So what are you concerned with? 
  [Castillo] The internal situation of an FSLN that is 
paralyzed. And I would not call the document a platform. For me 
and all of us who signed it, it is a way to force a logical 
review of the FSLN, to adapt it to today's circumstances, 
independently of candidacies and whether or not the concepts and 
contents of our document, like the Democratic Left document, may 
be revised. These are not absolute proposals at all. Instead, 
this is a way of questioning a party that does not want to 
change. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What were your motivations for signing that 
document? 
  [Castillo] Well, I saw it as an opportunity to force the 
FSLN 
to review its internal situation and try to find among all of 
us, including the Democratic Left and any other sector of the 
Front, a party that can respond to the people and to the ideals 
for which we fought and got involved in this Sandinist Front. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] We are on the eve of an Extraordinary 
Congress of the Sandinist Front. What do you expect from that 
Congress? 
  [Castillo] I expect very little. Very little. The documents 
I 
have read and the way the process is being carried out give me 
the impression that there is going to be very little space for 
people to try to rediscover the Sandinist identity and to find 
an FSLN restored to its values. I believe we are not going to 
have much of an opportunity, since the congress is being 
organized by those who are trying to keep the Sandinist Front 
from changing. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Are you pessimistic? 
  [Castillo] It is not a matter of being pessimistic. It is 
rather that I have no confidence that from this congress, 
arranged in a hasty and forced manner, there may emerge what we 
really want from the Sandinist Front. There has been little 
time, or rather, they have left little space where the FSLN 
could be in charge of a group of people who truly want to open 
up the party, both to face new challenges and also to recover 
the honesty and morality of the true FSLN of the past. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] The Extraordinary Congress is going to 
reform 
the statutes and prepare a new program. If the results are as 
you say you believe, will this mean something like "an election 
defeat announced in advance"? 
  [Castillo] I do not think the congress is going to deal with 
the 1996 elections, nor do I think the Sandinist Front should 
consider the next elections. The 1996 elections are a deadline 
for which we must be prepared, but not a goal. Sandinism needs 
to seek in this congress, as it should always do, more universal 
aims than elections, even though elections do have a great deal 
of importance. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What specific situations make you have 
doubts 
about this Extraordinary Congress? 
  [Castillo] The essential thing is to recover the moral 
authority of the FSLN. Even though the document that I signed is 
called, "For a Sandinism Restored to the Masses," that will not 
happen if we do not start by restoring moral authority. I can 
say that if we are unable to overcome this moral decline, a more 
or less moderate FSLN may arise, but it will not be the true 
FSLN, but instead a political party just like any other 
political party. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What is your reason for saying the FSLN has 
lost its historic morality? 
  [Castillo] What I am saying is that some people in the 
Sandinist Front are presenting the face of an FSLN that no 
longer has the moral authority it used to have. I say that 
essentially because of the abuses committed after 1990. There 
was enrichment, some people became businessmen, which is not bad 
in itself. What is bad is being a crooked businessman who 
expands his capital with other people's money. The mansions and 
property that those people now control--which they obtained 
illegally--the revolution had intended these properties to 
benefit the people, and not to benefit certain individuals. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What if the Congress does not define a party 
that identifies itself with what you consider the Sandinist 
Front should be? Would you resign your membership? 
  [Castillo] In my case, what motivates me in political action 
is a revolutionary concept that always remains when one really 
is a revolutionary. Being in one party or another is a question 
of whether that party responds to revolutionary interests. From 
its origin up to the present, the FSLN has unfailingly provided 
the most opportunity to develop revolutionary ideas and do 
revolutionary work. But if one day the FSLN is no longer 
revolutionary, then logically a person must go his own way. 
Something else will arise where that work may be pursued. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Do you describe yourself as on the left? 
  [Castillo] Intellectually, I think the left has not 
exhausted 
its potential. The next generation must continue to seek a more 
collective, more just society. And not only because I am on the 
left, but also because that is more consistent with 
revolutionary beliefs. Even with Christian beliefs for those who 
have them. Those hopes for a less egotistical, less 
individualistic society must not be lost. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] There is so much social inequality, 
unemployment, poverty.... What is the role of a revolutionary 
party in these circumstances? 
  [Castillo] Its role is to learn how to interpret correctly 
those circumstances and work so that, wherever possible, it can 
stop the savage and voracious advance of economic policies that 
do not respect any system of ethics, do not consider human 
dignity, and also use the right tools to regain power and from 
there make the changes that are needed. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Should the party lead the people's 
struggles? 
  [Castillo] The Sandinist Front should be at the head of the 
popular struggle. This needs to be understood. If people ask me 
about violence, I say that I support the violence we used in 
1979. If I am asked about confiscations, I support our 
confiscations in 1979, for we wanted a change and we made the 
utmost use of that opportunity. Did we know how to organize and 
make that permanent? That is something else. 
  Now, in these circumstances in which the historic situation 
tells us that we can only reach the government through 
elections, we must use this opportunity to bring about change. 
But that does not mean we are no longer revolutionary. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What is your opinion of violent methods of 
struggle? 
  [Castillo] That depends. Let us suppose that in 1996 the 
elections are won by a political sector that defends the 
interests of the masses, and the present government says: "I 
will not turn over the government." Then it would be legitimate 
to take up arms to recover power that was won in clean 
elections. There should be no scruple about taking up arms. But, 
of course, taking up arms unnecessarily does not make sense when 
we have a system that should be used first. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] The issue of relations between the Sandinist 
Front and U.S. administrations is fairly controversial. What do 
you think? 
  [Castillo] There must be honorable and respectful relations 
on both sides. The United States has been responsible for 
injustice, for poverty; it still is, and so we have to see. But 
that does not mean we should break off relations or be in a 
state of permanent confrontation. Instead, there must be a 
flexible response to its positions. If those positions are 
logical, then there should be logical responses. If they are 
positions of violence or abuses of our sovereignty, we must 
defend ourselves with all our dignity and with firmness, no 
matter what great power it may have. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Is the concept of anti-imperialism still 
valid? 
  [Castillo] That concept is now a little out of date, for 
empires themselves are out of date. Instead, it is the concept 
of sovereignty that should be understood and clarified. Our 
decline has been so great that now, even our relations with 
Costa Rica, which is not an empire, are not relations of equal 
to equal, especially with this government. The meaning of 
sovereignty is that it must prevail against any country. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What are your ideas about revising the FSLN 
statutes? 
  [Castillo] The principal axis of the FSLN should not be so 
much the statutes, for the FSLN is still in a phase of 
structural search and programmatic adjustment. Instead, it needs 
to change its internal mindset and way of thinking. The 
essential is a change in leadership; first of all, it has to 
decide to break with this clinging to power.... 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Are you talking about a change in mentality 
of the present leaders or a change in leaders? 
  [Castillo] I am talking about a change in the leaders in the 
top leadership and at intermediate levels that are clinging to a 
structure without any reason, rather than to power for the sake 
of power. I think that is more important than the program 
itself. It is the same with constitutions. You can have a 
wonderful constitution, and if it is poorly used, people can do 
whatever they want with it. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What do you think about the National 
Directorate as an organization? Should its name be changed? 
Should it be expanded? 
  [Castillo] It should cease to exist as a structure and all 
the members of the National Directorate should be removed. New 
people have to take over the leadership. Hierarchy has been a 
serious problem in the Front, as we have still not lost our 
concept of vanguard. We needed a vanguard at one time. In a 
political and military leadership a vanguard was necessary, but 
now it is not, for that concept brings with it a mistaken 
hierarchy. We need to set Sandinist forces free to seek their 
own leadership, and the discussion we are now having about 
methods of struggle, about the program, should be left to the 
free workings of the people who need that change. For in 
essence, these become discussions of the inner circle. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] On a personal level, do you have any 
aspirations to belong to a leadership organization of the 
Sandinist Front? 
  [Castillo] No, no, absolutely not. I am terrified of that 
type of thing because it is the easiest way to get entangled and 
caught up in complications. Other people can do that, people who 
have a type of discipline that I do not have. I think there is 
more freedom to question when you are on the bottom, especially 
in a phase of search and renewal.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Vargas] </F>
  [Text] The Legislative Assembly yesterday ratified the 
constitutive treaty whereby Panama will join the Central 
American Parliament (Parlacen). 
  In a little over 24 hours the Assembly approved in the 
second 
and third debates the Parlacen constitutive treaty, which was 
signed by the Central American presidents on 2 October 1987. 
  According to the treaty, Panama will have a representation 
of 
20 deputies in Parlacen, each of whom will be elected for a 
five-year term by direct vote. They will also be allowed to run 
for second terms. 
  The treaty establishes that presidents and vice presidents 
of 
Central American countries will join Parlacen when they complete 
their mandates. 
  It is estimated that Panama will have to contribute $1.7 
million to enter the regional organization. Parlacen will pay 
the deputies' salaries. 
  Parlacen will serve as a deliberative body to analyze 
political, economic, social, and cultural matters common to the 
region and the security of Central American nations. 
  Assembly President Arturo Vallarino said the current trend 
toward the establishment of world blocs makes it necessary for 
Panama to join a regional forum where its problems will be 
discussed.

<F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares met 
Thursday with Roberto Eisenmann, owner and president of the 
daily LA PRENSA. The meeting, which lasted more than 30 minutes, 
has been described as positive. The two discussed matters of 
national interest in the short and medium term. They also 
discussed the current Constitution and the need to make changes 
to it. Media laws inherited from the recent past were also 
discussed. 
  [Begin recording] [Eisenmann] He is doing everything 
possible 
to secure a consensus. Ten days before the elections I wrote an 
article saying that I was optimistic. There is evidence now that 
supports this optimism. The big test is always in what is done, 
not in what is said, but so far all of us can feel that this is 
a president for all Panamanians. 
  [Reporter] What about a national agreement? 
  [Eisenmann] I think that one of the most important 
components 
of a democracy is a vigorous opposition. I don't believe in just 
talking about national unity. This is a favorite thing for 
dictators. I think that in vigorous diversity there is the clear 
possibility of national consensus. I think that if he stays on 
the road down which he has started this will be possible. [end 
recording] 
  Later, Perez Balladares visited EL SIGLO in the company of 
Raul Arango, who is the future presidency minister, and other 
important advisers. During his visit, Perez Balladares met with 
EL SIGLO's director, Jaime Padilla Beliz, and other members of 
the board of directors of that enterprise. He was invited to 
tour the installations and was able to talk to the personnel, 
who greeted him enthusiastically. 
  Dr. Perez Balladares also visited the offices of the weekly 
EL CAMALEON, where he signed autographs and was photographed 
next to the equipment of this popular media organ, which has a 
high circulation. 
  Dr. Perez Balladares said that these visits are part of his 
campaign promises. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] This is a serious 
position, a commitment. I want to reiterate to the media that 
there will be absolute respect for freedom of expression, 
including the media that has aggravated me in the past, 
including the media opposed to me, which can continue opposing 
me with complete freedom. 
  [Reporter] What do you think about the way you have been 
received? 
  [Perez Balladares] Fine. I think that it is most important 
for people to maintain communications, to see each other, not to 
go separate ways. I plan to continue doing this now as 
president-elect, and you can be certain that as president I will 
also be visiting the media and talking to them. 
  [Padilla Beliz] I think that these actions by the 
president-elect are very positive. Let's hope the other people 
in his party share this attitude. He is trying to comply with 
and consolidate his promises for a national agreement. This is a 
source of much enthusiasm. [end recording]

  [Text] Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares will retain the 
Institutional Protection Service [SPI] and will promote its 
professionalization. 
  As the president-elect sees it, it is important to insist on 
a coalition government. This is what he hinted when he learned 
of the Arnulfist's decision to reject two ministries he offered 
to them. 
  [Begin Perez Balladares recording] My offer was not an 
intention to create political slots, but an intention to create 
agreements, affinity, and to have the best men and women in the 
country for national projects. [end recording] 
  Perez Balladares said that the Legislative Assembly must 
approve the designation of the new comptroller general from a 
list of nominees he will submit when he takes over the 
government in September. 
  The president-elect was also asked about the future of the 
SPI. 
  [Begin Perez Balladares recording] I think that all 
presidential offices in all countries must have a protection 
service for people and institutions. I think this service must 
be professional, apolitical, and capable of fulfilling its 
functions. If I find these characteristics in the SPI, it will 
continue functioning exactly as it functions now. [end recording] 
  Perez Balladares said that he has a special office to answer 
the grievances of public employees who have been unjustly 
dismissed. He flatly rejected the possibility of an Arnulfist 
becoming president of the Legislative Assembly in September. 
  [Begin Perez Balladares recording] I believe that the 
legislative branch will have to make its own decisions, and I 
highly respect that. However, seeing how the Assembly is taking 
shape, I think that it will be presided over by the party that 
has obtained the most votes, and that is us. [end recording]

  [Text] Guadalupe Tepeyac, Mexico, 16 May (AFP) -- During a 
meeting with center-leftist Mexican presidential candidate 
Cuauthemoc Cardenas, Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] 
subcommander Marcos warned that, "if there is not a peaceful 
path" toward democracy in Mexico there will be "a path of war" 
leading to "a transition government and a Constituent Assembly." 
  Cardenas is the first presidential candidate to attend a 
meeting with the rebels who took up arms on 1 January. The 
meeting was held on Zapatist territory in the Lacandon jungle 
and under strict EZLN security measures. The location is 
difficult to reach, requiring five hours of travel on unpaved 
roads. 
  Marcos, EZLN's military commander, harshly criticized the 
Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], whose candidate 
Cardenas is, according to Marcos not the best alternative for 
the transition to democracy. Marcos said that PRD "imitates 
what poisons the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], 
that is, government circles' plotting, betrayal, the existence 
of power groups, and neglect of the rank and file." In 
addition, the PRD does not offer a political project designed 
for the majority of the Mexican people. 
  Marcos said that EZLN differentiates between Cardenas and 
PRD, but he criticized the PRD campaign saying that through it 
the party attempts to "again side with the powerful ones." 
  On 21 August, close to 50 million voters will elect a new 
Mexican president from among nine candidates. 
  In an event regarded as "historic" by the participants, 
Cardenas met with the EZLN general command and talked with 
Marcos at length on two occasions during a special meeting near 
Guadalupe Tepeyac. 
  In a message addressed to some 200 delegates of Zapatist 
communities, the presidential candidate said he shares "with 
many Mexicans" the rebels' demands, particularly regarding 
democracy and social justice. 
  During an impromptu news conference, Cardenas said if he is 
elected he will respect any agreement reached between the extant 
government and EZLN and that otherwise he would seek a peaceful 
solution of the conflict "in the framework of the law." Also, 
he heard EZLN command leaders say they "have hopes for but 
mistrust" the candidates' because, they say, "the government has 
always deceived us with promises." 
  The rebels, wearing balaclavas or colored bandannas on their 
faces, warned Cardenas that they are determined to fight "down 
to the last round of ammunition" for their demands, but they 
asked Cardenas "to keep the homeland in mind" if he attains 
office as president. 
  The meeting, which was held during a Zapatist celebration, 
turned harsh because, while Cardenas spoke of settling the 
conflict peacefully in the framework of the law, the Zapatists 
virtually ruled out PRD, PRI, and the conservative PAN as 
guarantors of the transition to democracy and the possible 
originators of social changes in Mexico. 
  Cardenas said he is optimistic about the possibility of a 
shift to democracy in Mexico, a framework through which a 
solution to the Chiapas problem should be sought, because 
without this solution "it will be impossible to solve the 
country's problems."

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The PRD was harshly criticized when its 
presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano met 
yesterday with the general command of the EZLN in Guadalupe 
Tepeyac, Chiapas State. Subcommander Marcos said that a better 
Mexico might surface if EZLN demands are taken into 
consideration. 
  [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] We want to thank all 
the men, women, children, and old folks, who got together to 
receive and feed Mr. Cardenas Solorzano and the persons 
accompanying him. These children, old folks, women, and men are 
the true support of our EZLN, its [words indistinct]. If any 
government were to be based on them, it would be a good 
government. [end recording] 
  That is what Subcommander Marcos said. In addition, he told 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas that the PRD is not a democratic party. 
  Meanwhile, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the presidential 
candidate from the National Action Party, ruled out any 
possibility of meeting with Subcommander Marcos. Diego 
Fernandez de Cevallos says he cannot meet with a person who 
covers his face, even though his reasons may be justified.

<F P=106> [Debate between presidential candidates Ernesto Zedillo </F>
Ponce de Leon of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI; 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, 
PRD; and Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action 
Party, PAN; with moderator Maite Noriega at the Fiesta Room of 
the Technological Museum in the Federal Electricity Commission 
Building in Mexico City -- live] 
  [Text] [Noriega] I am inviting the candidates to enter this 
forum in the order established by the results of the lottery we 
just conducted. Good evening, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD 
candidate. 
  [Cardenas] Good evening. 
  [Noriega] Good evening, Dr. Ernesto Zedillo, PRI candidate. 
  [Zedillo] Good evening. 
  [Noriega] Good evening, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, PAN 
candidate. 
  [Fernandez] Good evening. 
  [Noriega] Ladies and gentlemen, before opening the debate I 
will briefly outline the rules agreed on by the parties to 
conduct this debate. 
  It will be divided into three parts. Each candidate will 
have the floor for an equal amount of time, under equal 
conditions, and in the order established by the results of the 
lottery. 
  The first phase begins with an eight-minute exposition by 
the 
candidates, who will discuss their political ideas in general 
terms. Later, each of them will have two opportunities, one of 
five minutes and the other of three minutes, to comment on the 
views of his adversaries, respond to questions or observations 
made to their own comments, or expand on his initial statement. 
  In the second phase, the candidates will have five minutes 
each to outline their proposals. Then each candidate will have 
two three-minute rounds to expand on their statements. 
  Finally, each candidate will have three additional minutes 
to 
deliver a final message. 
  It is important to remember that the candidate speaking 
cannot be interrupted and cannot use any more time than that 
established for each portion of the debate. Now that these rules 
have been outlined, we will open the first part of this debate. 
  PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas has the floor. 
  [Cardenas] The moment for this long awaited debate has 
arrived. This is a moment without precedent for the candidates 
who are promoting a democratic change: A moment on television, 
which had been closed to us. I hope this is not the last 
meeting of the three candidates who are here. I hope that the 
PAN and PRI candidates agree to meet again on other occasions 
before 21 August and to meet also with the candidates of the 
other parties. 
  This opening of the media is, without a doubt, a victory for 
those who from various positions and in various organizations 
have been struggling for a democratic change in our country. 
  I have been able to travel throughout the country. I have 
been doing this for the past six years. We have found an 
abandoned countryside, closed factories, and dismissed workers. 
  We have found poorly served dining tables. In these trips 
throughout the country we have seen roads in bad condition and 
situations that the majority of the Mexicans cannot appreciate. 
  In sum, we have found a situation most Mexicans cannot agree 
with. We can say that no one, except a few, very few, are 
better off today than in 1988. 
  What we have found in our trips throughout the country is a 
nation deteriorated by corruption, arbitrariness, and the lack 
of investments and opportunities. 
  With very few exceptions, most of the people, at least 
those living in areas where the country's resources are located 
-- a significant majority -- are all seeking some type of 
change, and all of us would like this change to be fair and 
reasonable. We should not be afraid of change. 
  We should all think of the changes that occur throughout our 
own lifetimes. Changes begin to take place in a small child who 
transforms into an adolescent, a young adult, and finally into a 
full-grown adult. As time goes by, we learn and acquire new 
experiences, and we learn new ways to resolve our problems. 
  This is the type of change we are seeking for our country -- 
a change that will allow all of us to progress and resolve the 
source of our problems; a change that will also allow us to rise 
out of the mess into which the current administration has led 
us, and move to a place that will permit us to enter a stage of 
development and creativity that will allow us to take advantage 
of our resources. We are seeking a transformation that will 
allow us to guarantee our children their right to life -- their 
right to be children who are not forced to work and, in turn, 
are able to study, play, and laugh. We are seeking fair and 
reasonable changes for every youngster throughout the country, 
enabling him or her to have access to education and employment 
-- changes that will allow them to take part in sports and 
encourage their creativity in the arts and culture. 
  We are also seeking changes that will allow Mexican workers 
to improve their wages and to have tangible job opportunities. 
We want changes in which women will be allowed to advance 
toward genuine equality -- a term that has become dead in our 
laws. We want changes that will open the door to new 
opportunities for women. It is up to all of us -- women and 
children included -- to pave the way to new opportunities and 
for these changes to take place at work, at play, and during 
cultural and political activities. 
  We are seeking fair and reasonable changes that will allow 
our farmers to plow their fields -- changes that will not compel 
them to abandon their lands to see how they can earn a living on 
the other side of the border, only to find themselves facing the 
uncertainties that prevail over there. We are seeking changes 
that will enable us to take into account the important 
contributions we have received from our retirees and senior 
citizens -- people who are responsible for what we are today. 
  Nevertheless, we cannot accomplish any of this with the 
government we now have. We cannot accomplish this if we 
continue with the current policies that have only led us into a 
situation of crisis -- a situation in which the only thing we 
can expect is that corruption, price increases, and 
environmental pollution will continue to pummel us. If we set 
our sights on this task, we can attain changes. These are 
changes for which we will have to work, especially if we expect 
to improve the climate of freedom. Enhancing the scope of 
democracy will allow us to develop economically and prevent us 
from stagnating, as has happened recently, and it will permit 
genuine social equality to exist in our country. 
  It is critical for us to progress in three important areas: 
democracy, economic growth, and social equality. The current 
administration has said that economic growth comes first. 
Nevertheless, it has been unable to implement any changes, and 
it has not been able to institute democracy. This government 
has caused increased poverty, and I would like to call attention 
to the fact that the PRI candidate has said the greatest shame 
-- his greatest shame and his government's greatest shame -- is 
none other the poverty in which these people have plunged 
thousands of Mexicans. This poverty has tended to grow. I 
would like to call on all Mexicans to prepare for changes. All 
of us -- urban and rural workers, artists, and citizens 
throughout the entire country -- should prepare for these 
changes which, if we are willing, can be engendered. 
  [Noriega] Ernesto Zedillo, candidate for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, PRI, has the floor for eight minutes. 
  [Zedillo] Good evening, fellow citizens. Thank you for your 
attention. Good evening, Maite. Good evening, Messrs. 
candidates. I appreciate your acceptance of my 24 April 
invitation to hold this debate, which undoubtedly will 
strengthen our democracy. The upcoming 21 August elections are 
about the most important issues. They are about the future of 
Mexico; they are about the future of our families; they are 
about the future of our children. Tonight's debate is for and 
about the future of Mexico. Each Mexican family will have the 
well-being it deserves -- the well-being that it should have, 
which Mexicans have worked for in the past and will work for 
from this moment onward, and not because of what we have failed 
to do in the past. That is why tonight's debate is about the 
future, not the past, my fellow countrymen. 
  I am sure that pretty soon Mexico can become the fully 
democratic country with progress and justice that all Mexicans 
are yearning for. That is why I assumed -- with great sorrow, 
yes, but also with steadfast determination -- the responsibility 
of becoming the standard bearer to replace Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
I have done so to work for the Mexico of which we all dream. I 
have confidence, my fellow citizens, in Mexico's future. My 
confidence resides in knowing that time and again we Mexicans 
have overcome our problems. We have overcome adversities. At 
times, we have defended our sovereignty, even with our own 
blood. My confidence also lies in my personal experience. I 
hail from a family in which limitations and poverty were a daily 
experience. Thanks to the efforts of my parents, however, and 
thanks to the efforts of my teachers and the opportunities 
offered to me by Mexico, I stand here today aspiring to be your 
president. This is Mexico -- a land of opportunity. 
  My confidence is also based on our country's strength -- a 
strength that should make us Mexicans extremely proud. My hope 
to serve my fellow countrymen is substantiated by a life of 
work, study, and knowledge, and a life of getting to know the 
country's problems. It is supported by a public career of many 
years which I began when I was very young. My career has taken 
me from the most modest positions of public administration to 
accepting two state secretariats. I know that I am the youngest 
of the presidential candidates, but I can assure you that I am 
the one with the most experience in good government. 
  I want to place my knowledge, my studies, and my experience 
at the service of my fatherland. Today, more than ever, I want 
to do so to become part of the solution to our problems. I want 
to do so in order that those problems which weigh heavily upon 
you today, my fellow citizens, can be overcome, because we have 
the ability to overcome them. 
  In matters of justice, I am convinced that the country will 
progress only if all Mexicans adhere to the fulfillment of the 
Constitution and laws and if those people who fail to do so are 
invariably punished in the terms of the law itself. I must 
recognize the fact that this is not the case today. There are 
many people who are annoyed by the prevailing injustice, the 
lack of security, and violence, and, often, the corruption of 
the police corps and the Public Prosecutor and Attorney 
General's Offices. This is why I am proposing the total 
reformation of our judicial system. This must be a deep-rooted 
reform, starting virtually from ground zero, because we need a 
justice system that will function for the Mexican people. We 
must establish a legal system that will protect citizens' 
rights, that will avert violence, and that will rid us of our 
security problems. I am certain, my fellow citizens, that we 
can achieve this together. 
  In terms of economic matters, without giving way to 
inflation 
and without returning to the policies of the past, we must 
reestablish growth. Our economy must grow faster than our 
population to enable us to generate the jobs you are demanding. 
This is why I propose an economic policy whose key mechanism 
will be the promotion of investment in order that we can take 
advantage of this great national state we have, as well as take 
advantage of the world markets that have opened, thereby 
generating the jobs that are being demanded. I think that with 
an investment policy that will encourage new businesses, bolster 
the ones extant, help the Mexican countryside, and encourage new 
activities in service and export industries, I am certain, my 
fellow citizens, that we are going to generate those jobs. I am 
also proposing to promote technology to give, together with 
training, a great boost to production. In other words, this 
should enable us to do things better in order that we can become 
more competitive, and, above all else, increase wages. 
  New economic growth, my fellow citizens, will provide us 
with 
resources to fight poverty. Poverty is our greatest challenge. 
We must work to enable those many thousands of Mexicans who 
still live in conditions of poverty to overcome this poverty. 
We will do this without paternalism. We will break this 
vicious circle -- this circle of poverty and ignorance in which 
they are trapped today -- providing them with education, health, 
dignified housing, and alternative sources of employment. I 
propose that the greatest triumph of our generation be the 
defeat of poverty. With jobs, better salaries, justice, and a 
frontal attack on poverty, we will be satisfying your demands, 
fellow Mexicans. 
  We will do so by strengthening our federal system, by making 
the decisions not here from the center but, rather, from where 
you live. We will do so, my fellow citizens, by strengthening 
our democracy. I invite you to work together with us for that 
future -- that future of progress, that future of justice, and 
that future of democracy, which we all want for our children, my 
fellow citizens. Thank you very much. 
  [Noriega] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate for the 
National Action Party, has the floor for eight minutes. 
  [Fernandez] My fellow Mexicans, friends: We are a young 
nation, with a majority of young people. We are a peace-loving 
people who want to work to live in a dignified manner and who 
want to progress. We have vast moral, cultural, religious, and 
historical wealth. Our country is large and beautiful, 
featuring abundant minerals and oil. As a birthright, we have 
the eternal embrace of the seas. 
  We have over 10,000 km of coastline, 10,000 km of coastline 
and beaches, with everything that it implies, from the viewpoint 
of tourism, trade, and nourishment. In view of everything that 
we have, the question we must ask is: Why is there hunger, 
neglect, unemployment, insecurity, guerrillas, and death among 
us? I think it is because we have not achieved a just order, 
because we have not been able to form good governments, because 
policy usually is not subject to ethics, and because the economy 
has not been truly human. 
  No, Dr. Zedillo, we have not come here to speak only of the 
future. To speak of the future, we must also speak of the 
present. To understand the present, we must speak of the past. 
In short, the debate will soon begin. For me, far beyond the 
extent of the debates, my interest is to invite you, the men and 
women of Mexico, "to participate in change, to leave 
selfishness, indecision, and cowardice." We need to know how to 
face the challenge today and we need authentic social leaders to 
turn into genuine political leaders. The task must be for all 
of us. Politics are far too important to leave them in the 
hands of politicians. 
  Undoubtedly, we have all heard fiery speeches in favor of 
democracy. Generally, however, they are from the viewpoint of 
rights. The PAN wants to insist today, as it did 54 years ago, 
that democracy too is doing one's duty. I invite you -- friends 
and colleageus -- to all go and vote freely, according to your 
conscience, because in that manner, we can democratically direct 
the destiny of our nation. Dr. Zedillo, if we all agree that a 
change is urgent than we must agree that we do not want to 
change in such a way that everything remains the same. Nor do 
we want, Mr. Cardenas, to return to a past to which we should 
not return. 
  "The National Action Party's view is that we should seek a 
change that does not imply destroying everything Mexico 
represents because it has cost the Mexicans a lot to have most 
of what we have." We need to achieve a change that will 
consolidate the good things, but at the same time be capable of 
overcoming and rectifying both political and economic 
diversions. I tell you, friends and colleagues, I believe that 
in the presidency I will be supported by you, as well as by the 
history of PAN and my work there, which has always been 
democratic. 
  From the opposition, fellow citizens, the PAN has secured 
rectifications in the government. When the government has made 
rectifications, we have supported such decisions for Mexico, for 
you, for the nation. We have also clearly marked the 
differences we have with the government. The differences are 
both political and economic and I will mention them briefly. We 
continue to defend effective suffrage, which the government does 
not respect. We advocate division of powers, which is not 
respected in Mexico. We promote authentic federalism, the 
municipal life. In one word, we advocate the state of law. 
Economically, we continue to advocate a truly human economy, at 
the service of humankind, in which we will all have the 
opportunity to work and benefit from the distribution of wealth. 
I frankly believe we have deep differences. I tell my friends 
and companions that we have a country and we have the people. 
What we need is a good government. 
  The PAN lives democracy internally and wants to share it 
with 
you, because it wants Mexico to live democratically. As PAN 
candidate, I invite you to support us for the Congress majority, 
to be able to reach the presidency of the republic, and to make 
Mexico a country in which we can live harmoniously with 
stability and progress. Thank you. 
  [Noriega] The opportunity to reply now goes to PRI 
candidate Mr. Ernesto Zedillo for five minutes. Please go 
ahead, sir. 
  [Zedillo] Thank you very much. My fellow Mexicans, during 
the past five years, our country has made enormous efforts to 
overcome a very pressing financial crisis. We have done it in 
order to set the foundations for future economic growth. 
Neverthless, we must acknowledge that this process has been 
very drawn-out. It has been a very difficult process. We are 
only now starting to witness the first concrete results. I have 
travelled throughout the country, and after campaigning for 
barely one month I have already received more than 34,000 
letters. The common feature of all these letters is people's 
anguish over their lack of employment or lack of better wages. 
That is why I am proposing a national agenda, starting from the 
foundations we have already, to establish economic growth as the 
first priority during the next few years. I recommend to do 
this with a program based on trust, conviction, and investment 
promotion to encourage the jobs you are all demanding. A 
central feature in this strategy must be proposals related to 
small and medium-sized businesses since they are responsible for 
60 percent of the country's employment. It is in this sector 
where Mexico's greatest export capacity lies. It is also because 
of this that I propose a fiscal, credit, training, and 
technology program to provide new incentives for small and 
medium-sized businesses to encourage the jobs you are demanding. 
Another issue very important for this agenda to address is 
attention to the rural sector. Fortunately, we have already 
carried out reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution which has 
resulted in ending an era of oppression against Mexican farmers. 
This reform explicitly establishes prohibitions on large 
landholdings and will enable us to fulfill the dreams of liberty 
and justice for which Zapata fought. That is why, beginning 
from the aforementioned legal ground rule, I propose a policy of 
dynamic investments in the rural sector. This policy will 
include training for farmers, new technology, access to timely 
credit and at fair prices, and guidelines that will enable them 
to market their products. My fellow compatriots, I propose we 
take advantage of our enormous national market and those foreign 
markets which are now opening up to us as a result of 
negotiations carried out by the government during the last few 
years. These negotiations were intended to create and elicit 
more employment. In addition, I propose that with the 
motivation we will elicit as a result of technology and 
training, we attempt to raise productivity. In turn, 
productivity will guarantee better wages for all Mexicans. With 
this new economic ability and more encouragement to save and 
invest, we will have a dynamic economy that will reward the 
efforts and sacrifices you have made during the last years to 
overcome the crisis. I am convinced that the time has come to 
pass from sound national finances - as Luis Donaldo [Colosio] 
would say - to sound household finances. It is time the effects 
of positive macro- economics be felt in the pockets and tables 
of each Mexican farmer and worker. I would like to assure you, 
my fellow compatriots, that all of this is possible and that we 
can all do it together. Mexico can have one of the world's most 
dynamic economies. This will be one of our greatest challenges 
during the years to come. I am quite sure that we can 
accomplish this as long as we set our sights on the future, as 
long as we decide not to revert to old policies, and as long as 
we remain willing not to experiment with what proved to be a 
complete failure. My fellow Mexicans, the future is in our 
hands. Let us all work together to make it happen. 
  [Noriega] PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos now has 
the opportunity to reply. Please proceed, Mr. Fernandez. You 
have five minutes. 
  [Fernandez] Thank you, Maite. Well, since we are here for a 
debate I would have liked to focus my time on Mr. Zedillo 
because of what he represents. Nonetheless, these minutes are 
for you, Mr. Cardenas. On several occasions you have said that 
Mexico's options lie between what the government offers and the 
option for democracy that you represent. Using the facts, I 
will establish that you do not represent a democratic option and 
that moreover, you are a man who straddles both the opposition 
and government sides. 
  Just look and see. Today, from the opposition, with 
democratic inflexibility, you contend that the government must 
remain on the sidelines of the election process. Yet you 
proceeded to implement an election law in Michoacan where you 
controlled the elections. I have a copy of the law right here. 
  Second, today you describe yourself in schools and 
universities as a tolerant, pluralist man, respectful of the 
younger generation, freedom of expression, and freedom to teach. 
However, in 1985 during your term as Michoacan governor you 
imposed Marxist-Leninist teachings. The text you imposed at the 
time is right here, in case you wish to review it. 
  And you are not just that, sir. In addition to appearing 
these days as a tolerant and respectful person -- and we might 
even say a person that students like -- the one thing you never 
mention to them is that you approved a law in Michoacan that 
really violates dignity, not only of the students but of an 
entire nation. I would like to read an article of the law 
which, by the way, was signed by you and which I hope you 
haven't forgetten. Just look for a minute at Article 101 of the 
State Education Law, which reads as follows: Any teacher who 
undertakes individual or collective activities that tend to 
disrupt public order will be separated from the state 
educational system. According to this law, all the youth 
involved in the events of 1968 would thus be out of the national 
education system. This is something you never mention to the 
students. 
  Here is another concrete fact, sir. Today you criticize the 
government -- and rightly so -- for deceitfully and illegally 
transfering funds to the PRI. Yet you yourself transferred 
funds to the PRI when you were governor of Michoacan. You have 
already acknowledged this. I have a recording of you in case 
you would like to hear it. 
  Last, you contend that you oppose the system of handpicking 
[dedazo] and presidential authoritarianism. I would like to 
demonstrate here, with documents, that you have indeed opposed 
handpicking, but only when it does not favor you. I would like 
to go back several years -- and Mr. Zedillo, please allow me to 
review some history here. In 1974 you say that when Echeverria 
appointed Mr. Torres Manzo to be presidential candidate through 
the usual mechanisms, you made a public statement that the 
government did not find amusing. Here is the proclamation. 
However, years later you were elected governor of Michoacan. 
When a friend of yours asked you how you were elected governor, 
you replied: I expressed my interest to the president of the 
republic, and I was finally advised that I was the candidate. 
  Mr. Cardenas, this is evidence that you are in both the 
opposition and the government. I can understand your 
presidential aspirations, and even your obsession with wanting 
to become president, but we have gotten to know you as part of 
both the opposition and the government. In this respect we do 
not believe that you are the best option for Mexico. 
  In conclusion, I would like to tell you that if we Mexicans 
are to believe your assertions that you represent the best 
democratic option for Mexico, then we would have to believe 
Aburto's claims that he is a pacifist. Thank you. 
  [Noriega] PRI candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, you now have 
the floor for five minutes. Please proceed, sir. 
  [Cardenas] I have never and will never conceal what I am. 
I acknowledge the events in which I have participated 
throughout my life, and in this respect, there is nothing for 
which I can reproach myself. I have been permanently involved 
in a struggle for democracy, the country's improvement, and our 
nation's sovereignty. 
  I want to say that the proposals we heard during the first 
part of this block of time might sound pretty similar to those 
who are listening to or watching us. But it seems that our 
words do not always mean the same thing. We have strong 
differences with the PRI and the PAN. 
  Regarding the PRI, I can say specifically that we cannot 
believe them. We have no reason to believe either the official 
party's candidate or the official party itself. They say one 
thing and do another. We all know that 6 July 1988 was marked 
by fraud and that this served as the basis for a government that 
to this day -- something about which we can do nothing -- lacks 
legitimacy. All candidates present here have spoken at one time 
or another about clean elections. But we say that the 6 July 
elections were the most fraudulent elections in the country's 
history. At this point we should ask that when each of us 
speaks about the upcoming elections, the PRI may be thinking 
that the 21 August elections will be exactly the same as those 
of 6 July 1988. 
  We also have differences with the PAN. One particular 
difference led us to not only adopt different positions but also 
to confront each other on our views of how to move toward 
democracy. When we voted in 1989 on the constitutional reforms 
of electoral issues, when the PAN voted with the PRI to take a 
step backwards, to close off democratic opportunities, this led 
to a confrontation between us. Nevertheless, I would like to 
use this occasion to invite PAN to join efforts so we can make 
our country move toward democracy -- to unite so that, in a 
joint effort, PAN and the Party of the Democratic Revolution can 
make a decisive contribution for a democratic change in our 
country. 
  We cannot believe the government candidate. It seems like he 
is just now noticing corruption, unemployment, and the many 
things lacking in the country. He seems only now to notice that 
government policies are a failure. He said this himself a few 
minutes, a few moments ago. He admits the failure of government 
policies due to all the backwardness these have caused the 
country. Thus we have no reason to believe in the system, the 
regime, which has been the greatest manufacturer of unemployment 
in our country, which offered us 1 million jobs a year and has 
barely been able to meet one-third of this goal. The government 
offered us supported, sustained, and growing education; instead, 
our educational system has seriously deteriorated. We cannot 
believe those who offered us economic growth. Today we are 
clearly bogged down. We must remember that the development plan 
was prepared by Dr. Zedillo. By now we should have achieved 6 
percent growth, by the end of the six-year period, and we are 
barely at 0.4 percent growth. These policies -- the ones 
offered by Dr. Zedillo -- cannot lead us to anything but six 
more years of the same. Six years of stagnation, corruption, 
contamination -- six years that would only mean a decline, an 
abyss for the Mexican people. 
  [Noriega] Candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the 
National Action Party, you have three minutes. 
  [Fernandez] Thank you. Mr. Cardenas, of course I am willing 
to work with all those who want to work for democracy, but in a 
serious manner, not only when it is advantageous or 
circumstantially favorable. You did not rebut any charges, so I 
will dedicate these minutes to Dr. Zedillo. 
  Dr. Zedillo, I want to tell you something that perhaps many 
millions of Mexicans would like to say. According to the 
information we have been given recently, we know you were a good 
boy who got high grades. But you don't get a passing grade in 
democracy. Let me tell you why. Allow me to make a comparison. 
I am here because thousands of free men and women in the PAN 
voted freely for my candidacy. You, with all due respect, are 
here as a result of two tragedies. On the one hand, the death 
of Colosio. On the other hand, the presidential designation. 
You are not responsible for the first one, but the second one 
disqualifies you. At least, if we are speaking of democracy. 
  On another topic, in what is left of my time -- your 
strength 
is economics. We know you are a good economist, and your most 
outstanding participation in the government, some aspects of 
which you mentioned, has been precisely in economic areas. 
There the government has failed on fundamental issues. 
  As a political party we have tried to act honestly. We 
recognize and are not ashamed to admit the things the government 
has done right. That is the function of the honest opposition, 
not to destroy everything or to question everything arbitrarily. 
I do want to tell you that when we do find differences, we make 
note of them. 
  For us, your national development plan accounts for 40 
million poor; 40 million poor is the outcome of your national 
development plan. Of course, there are some macroeconomic plans 
that we have recognized, but the final outcome is not justified. 
We hope you can tell us what happened to the projections you 
made, as secretary, of the deficit in current accounts. You 
made projections and failed repeatedly and for years by 
thousands of millions of dollars. We hope that you can tell us, 
if time permits, what happened to your growth projections of 6 
percent for 1993. We are at least 15 times below that. And 
regarding your plans and promises, I want to tell you that in 
any event I will have to believe you 15 times less than what you 
say. Thank you. 
  [Noriega] Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate of the Party of the 
Democratic Revolution, you have three minutes. 
  [Cardenas] I am surprised by the democracy that the PAN 
candidate sometimes preaches. I would think that we have to be 
looking at the government front in Guanajuato, not Carlos 
Medina, but Vicente Fox. In short, that is just something I 
will leave for you to ponder. 
  I insist that we cannot believe the PRI candidate. The 
judicial officials who engage in extortion, the inspectors who 
accept bribes, the chiefs -- those who were hired to establish 
cordons in Lomas Taurinas in Tijuana on 23 March -- all belong 
to the PRI. Why should we believe the government candidate now 
when he offers changes? The ruling party candidate has been an 
outstanding official of this regime, although I would not say a 
man of experience in good government because we have seen that 
his passage through the government in reality has been failure, 
failure in programming, failure in education. 
  But the important thing is what lies ahead. Why should we 
believe the PRI candidate when the government is the principal 
promoter of violence, the one that caused the Chiapas uprising, 
the one clearly responsible for corruption which Dr. Zedillo now 
recognizes? He now realizes, now that he is candidate, that 
there is corruption in the government. This was not until now. 
It took him quite a while to find out that there were flaws, 
things wanting, inefficiencies, and corruption in the 
government. Now we wants to correct it. He did not do this 
when he was an official in charge of important government 
positions. You, Dr. Zedillo, are the ones who generate 
violence; who are responsible for corruption both inside and 
outside the government; who have prevented the country from 
growing, from having better living conditions, from having more 
opportunities in education and culture, from making use of our 
natural resources. You have led the country -- and I insist on 
this -- to this economic stagnation, which has generated the 
largest unemployment figures ever recorded in our history. 
  [Noriega] Ernesto Zedillo, PRI presidential candidate, you 
have three minutes, sir. 
  [Zedillo] Thank you. First, I would very respectfully like 
to ask the candidates not to seek political profit from the 
murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio -- particularly you, Mr. 
Cardenas. Throughout Luis Donaldo Colosio's campaign, you 
frequently used your well-known verbal violence. I was 
especially offended when on 10 December, in Hermosillo, Sonora, 
you called Luis Donaldo Colosio a bad Mexican who was acting 
against the national interest. Instead of trying to profit 
politically from his image, you should apologize to Luis Donaldo 
Colosio's family. 
  Mr. Cardenas has said that the proposals all sound alike. 
That is true, because day by day his proposals become more and 
more like those of the government. As Mr. Cardenas realizes 
that his proposals are not welcomed by the Mexican people, he 
has adopted the government's proposals for himself. The 
question that arises now is: What would have happened if Mr. 
Cardenas had won six years ago, which he did not, and we had 
followed the economic policies he offered us? These were 
political policies of government deficit, that ignored 
inflation, allowed uncontrolled public spending, opened more 
state enterprises with subsidies to be paid by the people. 
  My fellow Mexicans, the answer is very clear. Today the 
country would be submerged in the deepest of poverties. Our 
economy would be a shambles. This is why I insist on speaking 
about the good things we have achieved, and there are plenty of 
them, which are not the result of the government's efforts 
alone, but of the efforts of the whole Mexican community. We 
must recognize our faults. I do. I will be the first to do so. 
We must move on, based on our strong points and our weak 
points. We have everything we need for a growing economy. We 
have the foundations, thanks to our sacrifice and our efforts. 
I propose we begin growing again and use the profits of that 
growth to fight poverty. I insist. Fighting poverty is our 
greatest challenge, and I am sure that fighting and defeating 
poverty will be the greatest achievement of our generation. 
  [Noriega] We have concluded the first part of our debate. 
Now we would like to hear general proposals from each of the 
candidates. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD presidential candidate, you 
have five minutes, sir. 
  [Cardenas] The axis of our proposal is democratic change: 
moving toward democracy by ending the current government party 
regime. On the other hand, we have the recovery of a productive 
economy. We must make one very important change. This will be 
a radical change in our country: Start abiding by the law and 
the constitution that the government systematically violates 
every day in this country. If we abide by the law, we will have 
a radically different country. We favor the separation of 
powers, true federalism, autonomy of our municipalities, the 
development of a system of freedom in our country. 
  We want to recover our economy by centering our efforts on 
establishing economic policies and generating jobs. These are 
the main challenges Mexico will face to effectively reactivate 
our economy, as we move toward the end of the 20th century and 
into the beginning of the 21st century. 
  We propose establishing an economy that takes people into 
account, not like that of the current government, which has 
disregarded Mexicans. We will begin an emergency plan that 
focuses on job creation and the reactivation of the economy, 
after launching an intense public works program that may lead 
economic growth in our country. 
  Additionally, we will begin to prepare a plan for sustained 
growth that we can implement beginning in 1996, that is, after 
the first year of government. This will permit us to reactivate 
and promote productive investments, as well as to finance our 
development without going into debt. We will only spend what we 
earn. 
  On the other hand, this plan will enable us to implement 
profound fiscal reform, creating a fairer and simpler tax 
system. This will permit us to end fiscal terrorism. We are 
going to eliminate the 2 percent tax on company assets as well 
as the harsh tax system. 
  But I didn't want to end this segment without raising other 
concerns. The government continues to violate our laws 
systematically. It continues to create dependency 
relationships, appointing officials who earn high wages and who 
are above the laws promulgated by the government. 
  Why did we create this national security coordinating board? 
With this we place officials above the secretaries of 
government, national defense, and the Navy. This is an offense 
against our Armed Forces. 
  On the other hand, we see that the government is purchasing 
water cannon vehicles. Is this to prepare for elections? Why 
does this government want this equipment? Why is this equipment 
being delivered to the Secretariat of National Defense? I 
believe this equipment should never have entered the national 
territory. In any case, it should have been delivered to 
municipal and metropolitan police forces. Or does the 
government want to pit the Armed Forces against the people? 
Does the government once again want to pit society against the 
members of our Army and Navy? This is the only explanation that 
can be found for these policies: to continue pitting Mexicans 
against Mexicans and not trying to resolve problems through 
conciliation. 
  Let us agree on how to advance. Let us agree on how to 
resolve problems. Let us all decide to walk together, those who 
may agree or disagree -- the former carry more weight -- to 
create democracy, to advance, to create a productive economy, 
and to achieve social equality. Every day this government is 
taking us farther away from social equality. 
  [Noriega] PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo, you have five 
minutes. 
  [Zedillo] Thank you very much. I would like to use this time 
to address a very important issue for all Mexicans. I am 
referring to education, compatriots. Do you know education is 
the key to individual, family, and national advancement? Do you 
know the only real thing parents can leave to their children is 
a good education? Even those less privileged Mexicans know this 
very well. 
  A few days ago, a street boy, Jesus Crisantos, a boy who 
does 
not own anything, a boy who lives on the streets abandoned and 
exposed to vice and criminality, told me: Candidate, what we 
need most is education, because you know that when we grow up, 
if we don't have education, we will not accomplish anything in 
our lives. 
  If we have education, we will show the people who think the 
kids in the streets are worthless that we are very valuable. 
Even Crisantos, the street boy, has a clear idea about the 
value of education. 
  Like all of you, I am convinced that we have to embark on a 
huge crusade for national education in the next few years. I 
had the very high honor of being the education secretary for 
almost two years. With the Mexican teachers' support, I was 
able to implement an educational reform program during this 
period. This reform allowed us to decentralize education, out 
of the hands of the federal government and into the hands of 
local governments. It was a true act of federalism because we 
took power, resources, and authority from the federal government 
and gave them to local governments. We were able to accomplish 
the first reform of lesson plans, programs, and material in 20 
years. We also established a new promotion system for Mexican 
teachers. Furthermore, we worked to reform Article 3 of the 
Constitution and established for the first time in our country, 
the right to education, compulsory education, and the 
government's obligation to provide preschool education. 
  Although we accomplished all this, compatriots, we know 
there 
is still a lot to do in education. That is why I propose a 
great crusade for national education. We must set ambitious 
goals for the year 2000. I propose, compatriots, that we end 
illiteracy. I propose, compatriots, that we guarantee that all 
children of age attend grade school because, even today, 15 
percent of our children do not enter grade school, and many 
leave school before the sixth grade. I propose, compatriots, 
that we make high school compulsory. I propose that we multiply 
opportunities for training and technological education. I 
propose, compatriots, that we give a big push to further 
university studies at public universities and technology 
institutes. We have to make sure that no boy with talent, 
ability and desire be left without university studies. Let us 
establish a national scholarship system for them. I propose, 
compatriots, as a special task, that we take education to the 
less privileged sectors in the country. Allow me to tell you 
that it will not be enough to open a school with teachers to 
achieve this objective. We have to take a big step and 
establish assistance programs that will provide food to those 
children so they can enter school and can remain there. It is a 
big task, compatriots, but it will be worth it. It is a task 
that we have to undertake for the future of our children. It is 
a task that will cost money. But I am sure we will be able to 
achieve this goal with the resources generated by our new 
economic growth. I believe it is a worthwhile cause. The 
country's best investment is in its people because they are the 
foundation of our future. Thank you, compatriots. 
  [Noriega] PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos. Please, 
you have five minutes. 
  [Fernandez] Thank you, Maite. I must respond to two charges. 
First, Mr. Cardenas, in Guanajuato the election was won by PAN. 
The post belonged to PAN. If we only managed to partially 
correct the transgression, don't blame us -- that is all we were 
able to do. We are not to be blamed for a fraud that was only 
partially corrected. However, I would like to tell you that I 
hope we can talk about electoral issues in the next debates, as 
you have suggested. For the time being, I have documents here 
with me, which I can present to you right now, on 23 cases in 
Michoacan, where your party was the one that emerged victorious 
and not as clearly as PAN's and Foxx's victory in Guanajuato. I 
am at your disposal for any debate on the issue. 
  Second, Dr. Zedillo, I have done nothing that could lead you 
to recommend that I not try to profit from Colosio's death. I 
have been very respectful regarding this tragedy. I was appalled 
at the crime and publicly expressed consternation. I only said 
that this crime was one of the reasons you were here. However, 
I also said that you were not responsible for it. I have not 
profited from the insidious and cowardly crime against Colosio. 
  I now move on to the proposals. From the PAN's perspective, 
it is not a matter of well-intended and demagogic recipes. 
Mexico's problem is that the country needs to be rebuilt. The 
country's reconstruction demands that all Mexicans make a big 
effort to develop a clear vision -- from a truly humane point of 
view -- of what Mexico is, with both its history, Dr. Zedillo, 
and its present in mind so that we can further its future. It 
is not a matter of inventing patches, recipes, or new programs 
and projects; we already know where they end up. We need a 
clear philosophy to run the country, we need democracy, and we 
need money. 
  Allow me to list a few basic measures -- briefly, because 
we only have a few minutes. 
  1. As president of the republic I will form a plural 
government. This is fundamental. It will not be a partisan 
government. A pluralist government is necessary if we want to 
attain peace and harmony among Mexicans. 
  2. As president of the republic, Mr. Zedillo and Mr. 
Cardenas, I will not be the head of a political party. I 
believe I would be the first Mexican president not to be the 
head of a political party. 
  3. I will respect and abide by the 20 agreements for 
democracy, which a very broad-based group of very prominent 
citizens from all across the nation have presented to the 
presidential candidates. I adopted it as my own because it is 
concurrent with the discourse and programs of the PAN, and 
therefore, I endorse the commitment. 
  4. I will respect the federal authority of the states and 
municipalities. 
  5. I will immediately increase by 100 percent the budget 
allotments for every municipality. This is a clear and viable 
offer. The allotments for each and every municipality in the 
country will be increased 100 percent. Let no one tell me that 
this is an unrealistic increase, because by removing just one 
expense account from the president's hands, we can increase the 
municipalities allotments 100 percent. 
  6. As part of a heroic national crusade for public security, 
I would propose the creation of a national guard. That is 
already included in the Constitution. 
  7. Regarding the administration of justice, I would propose 
the creation of a general council, tasked with recomposing and 
reorganizing this branch of government. 
  8. A national crusade is also urgent in education. We must 
reevaluate the role of our teachers. We must not change the 
secretary of education three and four times during the term, as 
was the case in this presidential term. We must increase 
spending and charge it to related items on the budget and to 
contributions from the community, especially if implementing a 
policy that would make such contributions tax deductible. 
  During the next administration we must achieve absolute 
discipline and honesty in government spending. We must pursue 
the fair, simple, clear, and permanent regulation of our 
administrative and judicial laws to allow farming and small and 
medium-size industry to flourish. Speaking of agriculture, our 
farmers demand justice and money. As time is short, I can only 
say that I will not allow a single case of land tenure or 
squatting. Let me say that during my next turn I will address 
financial openness. This is essential to prevent banking 
oligopoly and to create millions of jobs that the country needs. 
Thank you. 
  [Noriega] Ernesto Zedillo, PRI presidential candidate, you 
have the floor for three minutes. 
  [Zedillo] Thank you. My fellow Mexicans, this time I would 
like to continue on the issue of justice. One of the most 
distressing problems worrying our people, our families, is the 
lack of public security. We must admit that today the people do 
not feel that the law is on their side. Every day we hear about 
acts of violence, aggression against the honest and decent 
citizens of our cities. Quite frankly we must accept that our 
justice system leaves much to be desired. There are examples of 
corruption in the police force, in the Attorney General's 
Office, in the district attorney's offices, and there the 
deficiencies in the administration of justice which are almost 
commonplace. 
  One of the main proposals of the government I hope to lead 
is 
to completely reorganize our justice system. Such reform must 
begin by reviewing of our laws. Let's face it -- in our country 
there are still unjust laws. One clear example are the laws 
that deprive our women of their equal rights. I have presented a 
package of modifications to change that. I have also said that 
the the executive branch should not monopolize the work of the 
Attorney General's Office. I will promote the necessary reforms 
to end that monopoly. 
  I will modify, in coordination with state governments as 
part of our federal pact, the way in which police corps prepare, 
operate, and function. I will sponsor reforms of the Judicial 
Branch, undoubtedly to give it a greater autonomy; to give it 
total independence from the Federal Executive Branch; but it 
must also be a reform which guarantees that judges will be fair 
and that they will always grant citizens their legal rights. 
Fellow citizens, now is the time to launch that great legal 
reform. I intend to make this one of the first points in our 
government. It is true we must end corruption, impunity, 
arbitrariness. Hence, the legal reform. 
  [Noriega] PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Zevallos has 
three 
minutes to speak. 
  [Fernandez] Thank you. Undoubtedly, financial opening is 
necessary in this country. The government has committed a crime 
by opening up Mexican borders to the competition of the farming 
sector and the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise, while 
protecting a banking oligopoly. This is not fair. This is a 
crime that cannot continue. 
  We need to use internal and external savings to capitalize 
the farm sector, as well as micro, small, and medium-sized 
enterprises. We also need to get society involved in creating a 
modern infrastructure. Just think of the railroads. They are 
still Porfirio's after 100 years. 
  I will promote the immediate opening and pluralism of the 
media, without insults or rancor toward anyone. You know who I 
am talking about. We all have the need to have media sources 
that are useful to society. 
  I would like to make one final reflection, ladies and 
gentlemen. It is necessary that the government always maintain a 
frank, sincere, and constructive dialogue with the whole 
population. It is necessary for the government to call on the 
population to work on Mexico's behalf. The government of the 
republic must guarantee that there will not be harshness or 
tolerance with regard to the law; there must simply be justice 
and understanding so that all Mexicans can get along well. 
  I am determined to undertake, with your support, a federal 
government, a presidency of the republic that will radiate 
nobleness, dignity, and capacity to resolve problems. I am sure 
this can be done with your support. It is necessary that, once 
and for all, Mexicans have a government to support, a government 
to trust, a government of which to make demands. It is not fair 
once more that plans come and go, that once more they become 
just literature gone with the wind. Today we demand a 
commitment to the truth, and today the democratic choice is 
indubitably National Action. This is the peaceful offer I will 
talk about later. Thank you. 
  [Noriega] PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas will now speak 
for three minutes. 
  [Cardenas] The PRI candidate has realized too late that 
there 
are corruption and deficiencies in the police forces, the 
Attorney General's Office, and in the administration of justice. 
We should ask ourselves: why does he realize this now? Above 
all, why does he wait until now to report this? Why didn't he 
do it when he was an official in the current administration? It 
is now that he realizes many promises in the education sector -- 
he was secretary of education -- have not been fulfilled. 
Acccording to the Constitution, elementary and secondary 
education are mandatory. One-fourth of the children who should 
go to elementary school do not. In secondary school, only 26 of 
100 who first register are able to graduate. No effort was made 
in this administration to meet the constitutional obligation of 
making elementary and secondary education mandatory. 
  This government did not care much about improving conditions 
for workers. Today, teachers earn in real terms less than half 
-- 48 percent -- of what they earned in 1981. Why must we then 
believe the progovernment candidate when he said he will now 
begin to worry about education, that there will now be training 
programs, that there will now be better and more schools for 
Mexicans? 
  His administration incurred very heavy spending -- and he 
says we have to invest in people. Well, sometimes investments 
are made in people -- but only in some, and in very few. 
Indeed, they invested in very few people to prepare and publish 
the textbooks that many of our children still lack. The very 
costly textbooks are still being stored in the Education 
Secretariat, and we have yet to hear a public explanation about 
why a contest was held, prizes given, printing expenses paid, 
and the books then shelved when our children lack basic 
textbooks in schools throughout the country. 
  What does the PRI candidate offer us? More of the same? 
More lies? More unkept promises? I do not think this is what 
the majority of Mexicans want. I think we want a reasonable and 
just change. 
  [Noriega] PAN Candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, you 
have 
three minutes. 
  [Fernandez] To end? 
  [Noriega] No, sir, you have three minutes in this second 
segment. 
  [Fernandez] In this second segment, I would like to insist 
that today, more than ever, it is necessary to seek the votes of 
all Mexicans, the votes that Mexico needs: the vote of 
conscience, the vote of reason, the vote that will seek a better 
future for us all. We cannot accept the vote of fear, that 
accomplice fear that will allow everything to continue the same 
-- to Mexico's detriment, should it happen. To continue the 
same is to deteriorate. Nor can we accept the vote of rancor 
and resentment, which comes with vengeance and violence. We 
need the vote of harmony, the vote of peace. The National 
Action Party candidate invites you to work together for a Mexico 
free of lies. 
  We need to take advantage of this opportunity to rebuild the 
entire country. We, the men and women of Mexico, need to make 
an effort. Allow me to make a special call to youngsters. I 
call the young people of this country to intervene seriously and 
in depth, without lies, without pranks, without cowardice. All 
Mexicans have to step in, but there is a bounty, an endowment, 
an incalculable treasure in the women of Mexico. I believe that 
women can, if they decide to do so, change Mexico on 21 August. 
They can change, on 21 August, the course of a country that 
will only improve with the work of all its children. I ask 
young people and women to decide for an honest, peaceful, 
pluralist, civilized change. 
  We need to include everybody in this effort. PAN's political 
offer is pluralist and democratic. Dr. Zedillo said a few days 
ago that he will not form a pluralist government. This is 
tragic. These days anybody who understands the signs of the 
times has to present a broad range of views in the new 
government to be formed. This new pluralist government will be 
formed by the PAN candidate when he assumes the presidency. It 
will have more participation by the people, because only thus 
can we all work together to make this great effort to save 
Mexico from the tragedy that is so close at hand. We need to 
achieve change. We will surely achieve it because Mexico has a 
great future that cannot be lost. 
  [Noriega] PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, you have three 
minutes, please. 
  [Cardenas] I don't know how the PAN candidate can call on 
all 
Mexicans to join him and change the country when he has shown 
such clear contempt for so many Mexicans. I only want to recall 
that on more than one occasion, he called one group of Mexicans, 
who with reason were demanding housing because they lacked it, 
riffraff [descalzonados]. I don't understand a candidate who 
addresses his compatriots in search of votes and then talks 
about them in such terms. 
  This Sunday, the most recent one, the PRI candidate met with 
taxi drivers. It was a good meeting, according to the media. 
They offered the PRI candidate a beer, and he accepted. 
However, he said they had to put it in a glass so that it would 
look like cider. I ask you here: Does the PRI candidate want to 
give us beer for cider and cider for beer? Is this the offer of 
Dr. Zedillo, the current candidate of the official party, who 
has so many university degrees and so many academic merits, 
about which he boasts so much? Is this the type of government 
he wants to give the Mexicans? A government, I insist, in which 
he will give us cider for beer and beer for cider? 
  I also want to consider the people with whom the PRI 
candidate will govern. Who is backing him? We have seen 
pronouncements paid for by government officials, who say they 
used their own money -- maybe, maybe not. But he is supported 
by the people responsible for past six-year periods. Let us 
recall the statement that journalists called the Dinosaurs 
Manifesto. This is what the PRI candidate offers us: a return 
to corruption, populist practices, and a return to those -- they 
are the ones who support him -- who are mainly responsible for 
the deteriorated, disastrous economic, social, and political 
situation in which we now live. 
  I end and insist, cider for beer and beer for cider, is this 
the PRI candidate's offer? 
  [Noriega] PRD candidate Ernesto Zedillo, you have three 
minutes. 
  [Zedillo] Thank you. Half truths are but half lies. It is 
not right to lie to the people, even if only a little bit. Lies 
and verbal violence will only divide Mexicans and damage our 
social peace. Just now, when Engineer Cardenas referred to 
education issues, he only said a small part of the truth, and in 
doing so, he told a big lie. Engineer Cardenas, the balance you 
have made of the current government's education effort is not 
true. Perhaps, your advisers, with very bad intentions, did not 
give you the correct information. 
  During the current government, spending on education, in 
real 
terms, increased 100 percent. Most of this increase was 
allotted to increase Mexican teachers' wages. It's true -- 
there is still a lot to be done and this is my commitment. 
  You also did not tell the exact truth when you talked about 
the books in storage. It is true there was a contest, but in 
the end the panel of judges decided that those books should not 
be printed and they were not. There are no books on shelves, as 
you said. So, please, tell the whole truth. 
  I want to use the rest of my time in this segment, 
compatriots, to talk about democracy. I want to attest to you 
that my personal commitment, my commitment as a Mexican, is to 
further democracy in our fatherland. I want to assure you, 
compatriots, that we want more than your vote on 21 August. We 
want legality, credibility, and legitimacy. I am convinced that 
thanks to the electoral reforms made during the past years, 
Mexicans will have an electoral system that will totally 
guarantee the effectiveness of their vote. I do trust the 
almost 2 million Mexicans who will participate in the 
preparation and implementation of those elections. Out of those 
almost 2 million Mexicans, only a few belong to my party. Thus, 
let us have confidence. The next elections will be clean. 
  [Noriega] Now each of the candidates will deliver his 
final message. You will have three minutes to do this. PRD 
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, we will start with you now. 
  [Cardenas] I call on all of you, the Mexicans, to win the 
right to build our democracy. I will form a government with the 
best Mexican men and women, a government that will not just 
belong to the PRD, but one that will include all those who have 
actively participated in the democratic movement -- people in 
private organizations; in business, banking, and commerce; and 
people who are now in universities -- to have the pluralist 
government our country needs to be able to move into democracy. 
  I am going to call for -- this is a promise, and I have to 
say it in the singular -- I am going to initiate efforts so we 
can call a national referendum to reform our Constitution. We 
have to make ample reforms to our Constitution so we can have a 
constituent assembly in 1997. This body will prepare the new 
Constitution that is to include our aspirations and, based on 
this constitutional framework, find solutions to the country's 
needs and problems. 
  The next government will not be a government in which the 
PRD 
will replace the PRI. We do not want any more government 
parties. Thus, my party, in this case, will not be the one to 
replace the current government party. Let us have confidence in 
the vote and in the next elections, despite the conditions in 
which they are taking place. Let us remember that changes 
thought to be impossible -- Mandela is president of South Africa 
now and the opposition has won in Panama -- are today a reality. 
Let us have confidence in ourselves. Let us go into these 
elections with faith, drive, and a lot of votes. Our votes will 
decide the future of our country in the latter part of the 21st 
century. 
  I pledge to you that I will respect the electoral results 
and 
will make them be respected. We want independent management. 
We want Carlos Salinas to promise that he will not interfere in 
this election. We want Carlos Salinas to promise that the 21 
August elections will not be the same as the 6 July elections. 
I have confidence in the support of my compatriots. I have 
confidence that, together with you, I will be forming the next 
government and that this government will be the one to establish 
and develop democracy in our country. 
  [Noriega] Thank you, sir. PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo, it 
is your turn. 
  [Zedillo] Compatriots, I thank you sincerely for your 
attention. Messrs. candidates, I thank you for accepting this 
invitation. I invite you to meet and debate again. I invite 
you to debate, but now to include the other candidates too. As 
I have said from the beginning and throughout my campaign, we 
should have the opportunity to compare our ideas with those of 
all the candidates. Thus, I invite you to join me in a debate 
that will include all the candidates. 
  For my part, compatriots, I will continue my political 
campaign tomorrow. I will do so intensely and will continue to 
talk to all the Mexican men and women, especially those who have 
less. I will do this because I aspire to be president of the 
republic. And I aspire to be president of the republic, 
compatriots, to work with you in building the Mexico we all 
want. I propose, compatriots, that we work together to further 
an economy that will generate the jobs and wages you are 
demanding. 
  I propose that we work together on reorganizing and 
installing a system of justice capable of ending insecurity, 
violence, and aggression against our citizens. I propose, 
fellow Mexicans, that we launch an offensive against poverty. I 
propose, fellow Mexicans, that we remember the poor peasants, 
our Indian brothers, the elderly, and the handicapped when we 
wage our battle on poverty. I propose, fellow Mexicans, that we 
make equality for women a reality in law. I propose, fellow 
Mexicans, that we work together. 
  [Noriega] Your time is up, sir. 
  [Zedillo] You only gave me two minutes. 
  [Noriega] Very well. 
  [Zedillo] I apologize, the moderator made a mistake. I will 
take one minute to close. Excuse me. 
  I propose, fellow Mexicans, that we work together during the 
coming years to build that future of progress for our children. 
I ask you not to hesitate and to vote on 21 August. Go and 
vote with the assurance that your vote will be respected. I ask 
you to think of your children's future and your family's future 
when you cast your vote. Thank you. 
  [Noriega] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential 
candidate for the PAN. 
  [Fernandez] According to the rules of this debate, I cannot 
respond forcefully during this last speech, because Mr. Cardenas 
cannot answer. All I want to say, Mr. Cardenas, is that your 
accusation is unfair. I did not call those poor people who were 
demanding housing riffraff. I called the leaders who agitate 
them and never show their faces riffraff. Please read PROCESO 
and journalist (Galarza), a professional journalist, and you 
will find the text of what I said then and am reaffirming now. 
I did not call them that, and I cannot accept your accusation. 
  To conclude, the PAN has been struggling for democracy for 
54 
years. It has been struggling for 54 years so that Mexico may 
live in a state of law, and we are going to make it in the next 
administration. We have also been fighting for a more humane 
economy, so we can all live with dignity, jobs, justice, and law 
for all, thus guaranteeing that dignified, safe, and sufficient 
lifestyle for all Mexican families. 
  In closing, I wish to say that if I have not failed you now 
that I am a candidate, I will not fail you as president. I need 
your support on 21 August, but I will need greater support from 
you for the six years following that, because I can only be a 
good president for Mexico with your help. 
  [Noriega] Thank you sir. We thank all the candidates for 
their participation in this debate. My apologies again to Mr. 
Zedillo. On behalf of the National Chamber of Radio and 
Television broadcasters, we hope this event will serve to 
enlighten and unify all Mexicans. Good night.

  [Text] Veracruz, 13 May (Notimex) -- President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari said here today that the debate among the 
country's three leading political forces "is a big step forward 
in Mexico's democratic life." "We have experienced a genuine 
shift toward plurality. This shift, which is worth 
consolidating, is the result of electoral reforms that the 
country's various political forces have effected through 
dialogue," he said. 
  After closing in this Gulf of Mexico port the Second Forum 
on 
Financing and Investment Opportunities for the Southeast, 
Salinas said the confrontation "reveals our country's new 
political culture." 
  Presidential candidates Ernesto Zedillo of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI], Cuauthemoc Cardenas of the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party [PRD], and Diego Fernandez of the National 
Action Party [PAN] presented their political platforms on 
Thursday night. 
  Of this debate, which was held in Mexico for the first time, 
Salinas said: "We can declare that the electoral process in 
Mexico is not discriminating. Quite the contrary, it is 
all-embracing." He added: "There is room for everyone in the 
country's legal framework." Salinas said the candidates spoke 
freely and voiced without restriction their opinions and 
proposals so they can be considered and assessed by the Mexican 
people. "From now on, everyone should obey the law and the 
Mexican people's electoral will," he finally said.

<F P=106> [Article by Salvador Rico] </F>
  [Text] Some PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] 
members might join those who have already abandoned the tricolor 
party. 
  Others, "fed up with handpicked candidates [dedazos] and 
decisions adopted by party leaders [palomazos]," are organizing 
new movements to demand internal democracy. 
  These are two sides of the tricolor party's current reality. 
  After the defection of four important PRI members -- 
Demetrio 
Sodi de la Tijera and Miguel Basanez in the Federal District; 
Rodrigo Moreno Rodriguez in Guanajuato; and Guillermo del Rio 
Ortegon in Campeche -- forecasts hold that other PRI members 
will leave their party given their disagreement with the way in 
which Senate candidacies were recently decided. 
  Regarding the increase in internal demands for 
democratization, PRI representatives for 12 of the capital's 40 
districts yesterday announced the creation of a Citizens Liaison 
and Consultation Board [Coordinacion de Enlace y Consulta 
Ciudadana], which essentially strives for truly democratic 
selection of tricolor party candidates to the Chamber of 
Deputies. 
  The new group's coordinators -- Oscar Hidalgo, Jose Manuel 
Mota Lopez, Jose Luis Guerra, and Ricardo Palacios -- said "PRI 
members are fed up with handpicked candidates and decisions 
adopted by party leaders." 
  They warned that if there is no democratic selection of 
candidates for the posts of deputies and assembly members in the 
Federal District, the consequences will be not only the 
resignation of many activists but also a considerable decrease 
in votes for the PRI on 21 August. 
  They said both PRI activists and sympathizers participate in 
the new organization. 
  Jose Luis Guerra reproved the fact that candidacies are 
decided by the leadership, without taking into consideration the 
rank and file. 
  He protested: "Those of us who work with the rank and file 
are not taken into consideration. We are the ones insulted 
every time we knock on doors." 
  Leaders of the Citizens Liaison and Consultation Board, 
which 
has ties with Democracy 2000, announced they will submit a 
proposal to the PRI's leadership in the Federal District, whose 
president is Manuel Jimenez Guzman. The proposal is to cast 
votes to elect the candidates for the lower chamber. This would 
not only include the participation of party activists but also 
of sympathizers, because they are the ones who usually determine 
the victories. 
  They warned that the disagreement recently expressed by 
former Chihuahua Governor Fernando Baeza Melendez might multiply 
among people running for the post of Federal District deputy. 
  Democracy is an urgent necessity, Jose Manuel Mota Lopez 
insisted, adding that if the PRI leadership and Ernesto Zedillo 
truly want to honor Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta's memory, they 
should recall what the assassinated politician said in his 6 
March speech -- that PRI members do not want candidates whose 
active membership surprises even the tricolor party's members. 
  Mota Lopez said: Zedillo must fulfill his pledge to continue 
Colosio's political program. 
  He noted there are many members of the PRI who are deputies 
or assembly members without having earned that right, who now 
want to swap posts between the lower chamber and the assembly. 
  Many of those PRI members "have never taken a stand," Mota 
Lopez added during a news conference yesterday. 
  He explained that in addition to the risk of more defections 
and a considerable decrease in PRI votes on 21 August, this 
could result in protests at the chamber and assembly facilities 
in the capital. 
  The text of the document that formally creates the Citizens 
Liaison and Consultation Board begins by stating that "a 
transition process in Mexico's democratic culture is under way." 
  The document continues: "The armed rebellion in Chiapas, 
Luis 
Donaldo Colosio's death, the national stock market's ups and 
downs, and the increasing insecurity which prevails since 
Cardinal Posadas Ocampo's violent and still unsolved 
assassination have prompted civilian society to increase its 
demands for a change in the political system, above all in the 
way in which the next electoral process will be handled." 
  "Nevertheless, high-ranking groups insist on keeping the 
country in a state of political indecision and uncertainty, 
without allowing opportunity for democratic transition, which is 
now so urgent and necessary." 
  It then reasserts its immediate goal: 
  "The PRI should respect the statutes, declaration of 
principles, and partisan action program, and it should let the 
rank and file and the citizenry participate in the process of 
selecting candidates for different public posts." 
  Jose Manuel Mota Lopez reiterated his warning about the risk 
of more resignations among PRI members, commenting: 
  "I do not know why they are afraid of democracy."

<F P=106> [Article by Gabriela Aguilar, Jesus Rangel, and Georgina </F>
Tristan] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] </H5>
  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, an active participant in the 
construction of an economic model of "social liberalism" 
Mexican- style, faces today the challenge of showing the 
television and radio audience -- with politics and technocracy 
-- how he will manage to help society through a confluence of 
economic and social policies. 
  Within the PRI 1994-2000 Electoral Platform, the economic 
chapter proposes strengthening an "economy of certitude" by 
establishing the groundwork to expand production activities with 
price stability. This is the starting point to "launch an 
economic development strategy that efficiently and quickly meets 
society's demands for welfare and justice, based on responsible 
policies which do not threaten the essential balance of the 
economy." 
  Thus, it rejects a populist concept of the state and states 
that, within the processes for economic change and trade 
opportunities, "the state cannot renege its responsibilities" 
and it must maintain a framework of macroeconomic stability and 
guarantee opportunities for the free development of creativity 
and social initiative. 
  The state must encourage savings and investments, broaden 
regional infrastructure, support the modernization of small- and 
medium-sized enterprises, sponsor the training of manpower, 
pledge strict compliance with labor laws, and guarantee 
favorable conditions to strengthen salaries. It terms as not 
postponable the economy's reactivation to sponsor the prompt 
creation of more and better jobs, to take advantage of stronger 
finances to meet social needs, and to guarantee better 
conditions for stability in the economy. 
  The platform proposes a redefinition of the foundations for 
relations between federations, states, and municipalities for a 
better distribution of resources; improving the allocation of 
public funds; and increasing internal savings, "because a 
healthy growth must not excessively depend on external savings." 
  The platform also proposes defending the purchasing 
capability of salaries; improving the quality of public 
education for work; increasing consultation with the country's 
regions for an equitable development; sponsoring new plans for 
fiscal coordination among federations and states; and 
encouraging an active policy of investments in communication and 
transportation infrastructure. 
<H5>  PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] </H5>
  The PRD's economic platform mainly seeks to achieve an 
economic growth with equity and to create a new social pact that 
helps improve the population's standard of living. 
  To achieve the first goal, the PRD bases its position on 
three issues: A development policy that is answerable to the 
nation; a productive reorganization of the economy by sector, 
region, and environment -- starting with an overall renewal of 
agrarian and livestock activities; and the creation of a legal 
and institutional system which guarantees the validity of 
economic rights and equal opportunities for Mexicans. 
  To achieve the aforementioned goals, the party emphasizes 
the 
development of productive national and foreign investments, and 
the discouragement of speculative investments, by adapting 
internal interest rates to internationally competitive rates. 
  The PRD also suggests a revision of the tax system to 
achieve 
an equitable implementation of taxes. Thus, it would reduce 
indirect taxes and public service fees, and it would abolish the 
two-percent tax on assets. 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas will propose during the televised 
debate the ideas of gradually eliminating the oil revenues tax; 
increasing social expenses; sponsoring a recovery and expansion 
of the internal market and production enterprises; seeking a 
definite renegotiation of the foreign debt; and regulating 
economic relations abroad. 
  In the foreign economy sector, the PRD proposes a 
renegotiation of the Free Trade Agreement which includes the 
issue of manpower mobility, the exclusion of basic grains from 
the agreement, the revision of rules of origin which affect the 
automobile and spare parts industry, and a balance in the level 
of subsidies to agrarian and livestock products, among others. 
  The PRD suggests revoking the unconstitutional reforms to 
Article 27 and the exercise of the Mexican nation's full 
authority on its oil resources. 
  Referring to the new social pact, [the PRD] seeks to reform 
the Federal Labor Law and abolish Section B of Article 123, 
among other measures. 
  The PRD proposes the reinstatement of a minimum salary, with 
an emphasis on the increase in employment and productivity, and 
it suggests that the National Congress determine the basis for 
this. 
  In its political platform, the National Action Party [PAN] 
proposes to reduce poverty, strive for balanced regional 
development, create jobs, protect the freedom to create unions, 
abrogate the taxes-on-assets law, stimulate industrial 
development, break up the railroad enterprise, speed up the 
financial opening, back up exports, legally protect foreign 
investment, establish an agricultural and livestock model for 
the 21st century, and encourage the private sector's 
participation in all areas of the economy. 
  PAN proposes constitutional changes to restore the economy 
with the people in mind, changes like amending Article 25 to 
establish clearly the state's subsidiary role. The party 
pledges to reduce the serious poverty of some 14 million 
Mexicans through social education programs such as responsible 
parenthood, hygiene, nutrition, fighting alcohol and drug 
addiction, care of mothers and children, and allocating monetary 
resources for the general development of Indian communities. 
  Also, the party proposes to abolish Paragraph B of Article 
123 of the Constitution so all workers can share the same 
rights; eliminate unnecessary fiscal burdens, such as taxes on 
assets and payrolls; increase contributions for SAR [Retirement 
Savings System]. 
  PAN proposes to recognize the government workers' right to 
form associations and join more than one union; restore women's 
labor rights to be hired and paid their salaries without 
discrimination. 
  The party proposes to launch a countrywide industrial and 
commercial development program of property and services where 
very small-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises would be given 
priority attention. 
  Finally, PAN proposes to open the railroads to local and 
foreign investment, separating them from the public sector, and 
increasing the private sector's participation in infrastructure.

<F P=106> [By Juan Jose Coello] </F>
  [Text] Mexico is living a narcodemocracy and 
narcotraffickers have achieved socioeconomic influence, Eduardo 
Valle Espinoza, former adviser to the Attorney General's office 
[PGR] of Diego Valades and Jorge Carpizo, has stated. Valle, 
who resigned on 1 May, stated the foregoing in his resignation 
letter. 
  "After learning of the above, I ask: When will we have the 
courage and political maturity to tell the Mexican people we are 
living in a narcodemocracy? Will we have the intellectual 
capability and ethical strength to say that Amado Carrillo, 
Arellano Felix, and Juan Garcia Abrego are, inconceivably and 
degradingly, the promoters and even pillars of our socioeconomic 
growth and development?" 
  In his resignation letter, the official briefly explained 
the 
narcotrafficking problem in Mexico and he recognized his failure 
to dismantle the Matamoros Cartel led by Juan Garcia Abrego. 
This was a task which had been assigned to him by Valades. 
  "I recognize that I did not have the capability to apprehend 
the public leader of the Gulf of Mexico Cartel. I truthfully 
did all that I could within my means. I failed and regrettably 
admit it," the former PGR adviser stated. 
  His resignation had been kept silent for unexplained 
reasons. 
  "I am leaving as I entered. I have no money, but I have 
gained knowledge and experience. Nobody can say I harmed anyone 
without a true juridical basis. I can look anyone in the face 
and feel no shame," he stated in his letter. 
  Valle Espinoza also questioned the programs and plans to 
fight narcotrafficking and raised the possibility that the 
assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio may have been drug-related. 
  "Nobody can conceive of a political project in which the 
narcotrafficking lords and financiers are not included, because 
if he does so he is dead. Perhaps evidence of that will be 
found in relation to the 23 March incident in Tijuana. 
Although, I warn, I don't have any more information about that 
infamous act than that which is publicly known." 
  In the last part of his letter, Valle Espinoza thanked 
Carpizo and the president for their trust, which he claims he 
never failed. Valle Espinoza was appointed to his post in early 
1993. 
  Valle Espinoza began to hunt down Garcia Abrego with the 
support of 30 agents, all heavily armed and recruited by 
himself. He was also provided with communications equipment, 
vehicles, two helicopters, an aircraft, and a big budget. 
  According to official investigations, the Gulf Cartel, known 
previously as the Matamoros Cartel, has $10 billion in 
resources, heavy political and police influence, and an "Army" 
of more than 500 men. The PGR is investigating since last week 
the transfer of Garcia Abrego and his principal deputies. 
  Valle's actions resulted in the arrests of 10 drug 
traffickers and the confiscation of at least 50 properties in 
various states of the republic.

<F P=106> [By Juan Jose Coello] </F>
  [Text] The PGR [Attorney General's Office] described Nuevo 
Leon as a narcodollar laundering capital after discovering that 
about 70 alleged businessmen have approximately $4 billion 
invested in area industries and businesses. 
  A high-ranking PGR official disclosed that an investigation 
of money laundering in Nuevo Leon began by presidential order in 
1991 and has not concluded. 
  "We have fully identified about 70 businessmen who live in 
Monterrey and have investments in Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, and 
Tamaulipas," the official said. 
  "Each drug trafficker we investigated led us to other people 
involved. What were believed to be simple covers turned out to 
be part of a gigantic money laundering network of international 
proportions" the interviewed officer said. 
  All of those involved are directly connected with the 
Matamorros Jail, and their leader is Juan Garcia Abrego, the 
officer added. 
  The mafia's money, he said, is invested primarily in 15 
types 
of industries and businesses. 
  "There are narcobusinessmen in construction, 
telecommunications, automobile dealerships, real estate, and 
medium-sized export and foundry companies," he said. 
  He added: "There is also some involvement in art agencies, 
travel agencies, transportation, buildings, finance companies, 
the media, electronics purchases and sales, cattle ranching, 
investments, and air cargo." 
  The PGR official said there are specific cases where only a 
few of the partners in a consortium have committed the crime, 
not every business partner. 
  The results of the huge investigation, he added, have just 
now been made public, and he guessed that this is only the 
beginning of a long chain of arrests and searches. 
  "These investigations have been the most complicated the PGR 
has had to face during this six-year term," the source said. 
  Some of the businessmen involved in narcodollar money 
laundering have left a trail and been identified, and there is 
evidence against them. 
  "These are people from middle-class families who are 
suddenly 
millionaires overnight. They make their first appearance in 
society as owners of gigantic businesses," he said. 
  According to the high-ranking official, the businessmen 
involved in money laundering are known to everyone. They appear 
in newspapers, create publicity for themselves, and enjoy much 
prestige. 
  "They obey all laws, pay taxes, keep their bank accounts in 
good order, request loans pretending to have financial problems, 
and even go to church," he said. 
  "They keep everything in order except their business money 
comes from drug trafficking," the official said.

<F P=106> [Report by Gerardo Roman] </F>
  [Text] In the middle of the guerrilla crisis caused by the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] in Chiapas, the 
National Security and Investigation Center requested that 
various military and police corps create an Antiterrorist Group 
[Grupo Antiterrorista -- GAT] with agent selection to be based 
on a criteria of high levels of training and skills. 
  Among the institutions that were asked to cooperate are the 
Federal Judicial Police, the "Foxes" [Zorros] squadron of the 
Secretariat of Roads and Safety, the Army, the presidential 
staff, and the Federal District's Judicial Police. 
  According to statements by several GAT members and sources 
close to institutions involved, approximately 300 specialized 
agents were trained by instructors from the United States, 
Spain, and Argentina. 
  Police sources reported the objective of GAT was to create 
an 
organization to end terrorism, kidnappings, and prolonged 
guerrilla violence such as bomb explosions in various cities of 
the country. 
  GAT members took courses on explosives, explosives 
investigations, assaults on installations, intelligence, and 
photography. They received training to infiltrate organizations 
such as the Independent Proletariat Movement, the Revolutionary 
Workers Party, the Peasant-People Union Movement, and the EZLN. 
  Approximately 15 days ago, the agents were summoned to the 
National Security Center to launch an antiterrorist operation 
and, according to sources, they would be deployed in groups in 
the States of Guerrero, Michoacan, Oaxaca, Jalisco, Chiapas, and 
the Federal District and its contiguous urban areas.

  [Excerpt] Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana has said 
that truth must be the golden rule in politics as well as the 
public administration and added that this principle, which 
should be part of this electoral campaign, has not been 
respected by all the candidates for president. 
  Without mentioning names, but clearly alluding to them, 
Pastrana criticized Liberal candidates Ernesto Samper Pizano and 
Humberto de la Calle for their alleged sudden changes of opinion 
and attitude. 
  "One cannot trust someone who in June 1980 signed the ANIF 
[National Association of Financial Institutions] report 
supporting the legalization of marijuana and later reiterated 
this support at a meeting at the presidential palace on 13 May 
1993 and today changes his mind and rends his garments when what 
he so staunchly supported has been legalized," Pastrana said 
when referring to Samper. 
  "One cannot trust someone who today supports what he denied 
yesterday; one cannot trust someone who yesterday said `I will 
never accept' and today accepts it," Pastrana said in reference 
to De la Calle. 
  Pastrana spoke on Monday night at the Tequendama Hotel 
during 
an event to honor him sponsored by the Future Foundation. 
Several reporters were also invited to attend the event. 
  During his speech Pastrana insisted that his actions have 
been in accord with his way of thinking and that he is not lying 
to the country nor is he contradicting himself before the 
Colombian people. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Diego Suarez from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Colombian Government strongly protested today 
Amnesty International's charges of alleged human rights abuses 
by the Armed Forces and the police in Colombia. Amnesty 
International published full-page advertisements in two 
prominent London newspapers saying that the government allows 
the Colombian Army to murder with impunity. 
  The full-page ad by Amnesty International in London's THE 
INDEPENDENT and THE GUARDIAN newspapers, show a street youth 
sniffing glue. The caption explains that many of these children 
are killed by death squads paid by businessmen who want to clear 
the streets. 
  Amnesty International also states that the ad intends to 
irritate the Colombian Government, which is trying to convince 
the world that it is doing everything in its power to end the 
murders. Amnesty International also says that the Colombian 
Government wants to make believe that most murders are the work 
of drug traffickers, guerrillas, or a few wicked soldiers, but 
the truth is that most murders are committed by the Armed Forces 
or the police. The organization argues that the government does 
not want to face the Army and it says the Army is literally 
allowed to kill with impunity. 
  Finally, the ad expresses hope that the new president, who 
will be elected this month, will make human rights one of his 
top priorities. The ad was rejected by both spokesmen of the 
government and the military forces. The spokesmen described the 
ad as biased and as part of a guerrilla strategy to damage 
Colombia's image and the image of the Colombian Government 
abroad.

  [Text] The government will authorize the large-scale import 
of food products to check the rapid increase in the cost of 
living. Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes has said a document is 
being drafted to eliminate what he described as excessive 
subsidizing of the agricultural sector. He also announced that 
the local price of coffee would be revised before August. 
  [Begin Hommes recording] There is excessive protection of 
the 
agricultural and livestock sectors. This excessive protection is 
main reason for this price hike. Something can be done through 
foreign trade by expediting the import of certain types of food 
products. [end recording] 
  With this remark, Minister Hommes announced the government's 
determination to disable the system whereby a minimum price is 
set for the import of rice, sugar, beans, and other 
government-subsidized products. For the time being, the import 
of potatoes, rice, cooking oil, and certain cereals will get the 
green light. 
  [Begin Hommes recording] For instance, the prices of 
materials for the cooking oil industry are too high and there is 
excessive protection in this area. I wonder why the gentlemen 
[not further identified] are so silent. [end recording] 
  Before flying to London, where he would meet with several 
businessmen interested in investing in Colombia, Hommes 
announced he would revise the local price of coffee and said 
that a decree will be issued next week to prevent the 
participation of pension and dismissal funds in Banco Popular's 
privatization process.

  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani confirmed yesterday that 
the negotiations for a free trade agreement between Mexico and 
three Central American countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El 
Salvador -- have gained "great momentum," particularly in our 
nation. 
  The president said the treaty negotiations with Mexico are 
going well: "I believe that the negotiations have advanced 
considerably." Cristiani stressed that negotiations for the 
trade agreement are not being carried out bilaterally between El 
Salvador and Mexico, but also include Guatemala and Honduras. 
"There is willingness by the Guatemalan, Honduran, and 
Salvadoran Governments to establish the mechanisms to conclude 
the treaty with Mexico as soon as possible," he said. 
  The Salvadoran president explained that the free trade 
agreement (FTA) with Mexico is on course, and that proof of this 
is the creation of 12 work groups to give simultaneous 
consideration to different FTA issues. In addition, 
President-elect Armando Calderon Sol announced on Thursday that 
the agreement with Mexico would be signed at year's end, a 
statement that prompted reactions from the country's business 
sector. 
  For businessman Pablo Tesak, the date given for 
implementation of the FTA is "impossible" to meet because 
Salvadoran private enterprise must modernize "a lot" to be able 
to compete with Mexican industry. 
  Regarding this issue, President Cristiani said there is no 
problem in complying with the date set for the signing of the 
trade agreements: "perhaps the difficulty lies in the Salvadoran 
businessmen's participation." According to president Cristiani 
the businessmen's participation is fundamental to the efficient 
operation of a trade agreement of this nature, "because the 
businessmen will provide the dynamics needed for the proper 
development and operation of the trade agreement." The 
president said the role of the government is to create the 
operational framework to set up the economic agreement, the rest 
is up to the nation's productive sector. 
  Meanwhile, the Corporation of Exporters of El Salvador 
(Coexport) points out in a communique that the conversations on 
the possible signing of a trade agreement between Mexico and 
Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, "should not be conducted 
in haste." Coexport asks the government to be "cautious" during 
negotiations for a new trade agreement with Mexico, because the 
latter has experience in this area as a result of NAFTA.

  [Text] President-elect Armando Calderon Sol, upon his 
return yesterday from Mexico City, confirmed that the government 
will sign a free trade agreement with Mexico before the end of 
the year. 
  Calderon Sol, who will assume the presidency on 1 June, said 
that "if negotiations continue at their current rate," the 
treaty could be signed before the end of President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's term, set for 1 December. 
  The president-elect met with several ministers and local 
business representatives during his visit to Mexico. The 
purpose was to measure the degree of interest in investments in 
El Salvador. He said this was only possible "thanks to the 
stability of the democratic system and the peace process, which 
have given the county prestige." 
  In statements to the Mexican press, Calderon Sol expressed 
his willingness to establish a common market, since this would 
open operations to 120 million consumers, 30 million of which 
are in the Central American isthmus. 
  If no agreement is signed during President Salinas de 
Gortari's mandate, talks would continue with the new president 
to be elected on 21 August. The new Salvadoran president said 
that signing a free trade agreement with Mexico would be the 
first step toward reaching a similar agreement with the United 
States. 
  On 23 May Calderon Sol will fly to Washington to meet Vice 
President Al Gore, who will host a summit meeting several days 
later to discuss NAFTA with all of the Central American 
presidents. In commenting on his scheduled trip to UN 
headquarters in New York, the president-elect said he had "no 
concerns at all about addressing any topic with the secretary 
general." He was referring to statements made by Chief Justice 
Mauricio Gutierrez Castro, of the Supreme Court of Justice, 
during the opening session of the Legislative Assembly. 
  He explained the purpose of his trip was to express the 
political will to fully comply with the peace agreements and to 
request aid from the United Nations, through agencies such as 
UNICEF, FAO, and the WHO. He said that, belonging to this 
international forum, El Salvador has a right to the programs 
these agencies offer. Therefore, it can request such aid "with 
dignity and authority."

  [Text] Caracas, 17 May (NOTIMEX) -- New student 
demonstrations and some incidents were reported today in Caracas 
and three cities in the interior of the country protesting an 
increase in public transportation fares, according to police 
sources. 
  Metropolitan Police Chief Jose Hernandez said that the 
Interior Ministry and student federations agreed at a meeting 
that demonstrations must be peaceful. Despite verbal agreements 
between students and the government, the conflict has not been 
resolved, as the authorities have been unable to force bus 
owners to charge students preferential fares, and therefore 
protests are expected to continue. 
  Students are demanding that private bus owners comply with 
the law establishing that students--more than 2 million 
throughout the country--only have to pay half of the regular 
fares. 
  High school students who took to the streets to hurl stones 
and bottles to disrupt traffic near a housing complex in the "23 
January" neighborhood were convinced by police to break up the 
demonstration. After talking to a group of students who were 
protesting at a school in the "Gran Colombia" education center, 
the metropolitan police managed to discourage them from 
continuing their protests. Students from two schools located at 
the Fuerzas Armadas Street in downtown Caracas tried to hold up 
a truck transporting mineral water, but National Guard members 
who are discreetly patrolling the streets prevented them from 
setting the vehicle on fire. The police also prevented students 
from holding up a truck transporting paint, which was 
intercepted by the demonstrators. 
  Today authorities arrested 20 students in the city of Los 
Teques in western Venezuela. On 16 May there were incidents 
between riot police and demonstrators in three cities in the 
interior of the country, during which one vehicle was set on 
fire. 
  Meanwhile, teachers in Caracas marched peacefully through 
the 
main streets downtown demanding payment of wage increases 
granted in January which have not been honored by the government 
of President Rafael Caldera. 
  In addition, hundreds of journalists demonstrated in front 
of 
Congress defending their association rights and demanding the 
prompt approval by Congress of amendments to the journalism law. 
At the demonstration called by the National Association of 
Journalists (CNP) the participants protested a campaign promoted 
by the Press Association (which groups the media owners) against 
the journalism law.

  [Text] According to Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz, the 
transportation strike set for Wednesday, 18 May, was called off 
because of meetings the Single Union of Independent Vehicles has 
held with the neighborhood committees to reach an agreement on 
an increase in the minimum fare. 
  [Begin Isturiz recording] Whenever fares are discussed, a 
strike is always announced as a pressure tactic. On Thursday, I 
met with this union, and I think the strike was suspended. The 
union accepted a timetable to hold bilateral discussions between 
the bus companies and the neighborhood associations and the 
community boards, but not between the bus companies and the 
neighborhood assemblies. [sentence as heard] An agreement has 
been reached with some bus companies, while the discussions 
continue with the others. [end recording] 
  Isturiz added that the increase in the minimal fare will be 
based on the service the bus line companies provide, the 
conditions of each bus, and the routes covered. For that reason, 
the minimual bus fare will range from 12 bolivares to 15 
bolivares.

  [Text] The militarization of the struggle against drugs as 
a priority of the Venezuelan state will be proposed to President 
Rafael Caldera, who will receive an analysis of the country's 
problem and an action plan to fight it. The plan was studied 
yesterday during a joint meeting between civilian and military 
organizations. 
  The secret conference at the Palacio Blanco was presided 
over 
by Division General Alberto Emerich Esqueda Torres (Army) and 
Brigadier General Jesus Antonio Rojas Salazar (National Guard), 
executive secretary and assistant secretary of the National 
Security and Defense Council (Seconasede), respectively; 
representatives of the Defense Ministry and National Border 
Council; and chiefs of narcotics in the Army, Navy, Air Force, 
and National Guard. 
  Doctor Vladimir Gessen, former chairman of the Chamber of 
Deputies Drug Commission and chairman of the Foundation for a 
Drug-Free Venezuela, was invited to address the closed meeting. 
<H5>  THE CONTINENT'S PROBLEM </H5>
  In its initial analysis of the problem, Gessen's lecture 
referred to the basic factors of regional and continental 
security, including the production and processing in Peru, 
Bolivia, and Colombia of 1,170 tons of cocaine whose final 
destination is the U.S. consumer market. 
  According to international organizations' figures, the 
production of this volume of drugs in those countries costs 
$5,000 per kilo, which represents an investment of $5.85 
billion. The average price on the U.S. wholesale market 
increases to $25,000 per kilo, which represents an approximate 
income of $29.835 billion. International drug trafficking 
organizations' profit margins fluctuate around these suggested 
amounts. 
  Moreover, the overall volume per year, approximately 1,170 
tons, has another angle of benefits for the cartels. When the 
drug is "cut," through mixtures that reduce its level of purity, 
the volume increases to 1,649,700 kg. 
  Calculations of the illegal activity indicate the retail 
sale 
of that amount for an average price of $98 per gram yields 
traffickers an income of approximately $161,670,600 per year. 
Meanwhile, other drugs yield them an income of approximately 
$90,113,212 per year. In other words, the U.S. market yields 
$251,783,812 per year. The volume sent to the United States 
represents 75 percent of the Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia 
cartels' annual production; and the remaining 25 percent is sent 
to the European markets. 
<H5>  VENEZUELA'S SITUATION </H5>
  In Venezuela's case, it is estimated that 200 tons of drugs 
are brought to the country every year. Based on production 
costs, this represents approximately $1 billion. But once the 
drug reaches the U.S. market, the amount increases to $5.1 
billion. 
  The following give an idea of the importance of shipments 
that pass through the national territory: 1) A shipment of 
concrete poles was seized at the United States (Miami) in 
December 1991. The poles contained 15,700 kg of cocaine with a 
net cost of $78.5 million, approximately 10,754,500,000 
bolivares (at the exchange rate quoted during the last quarter 
of 1993). An additional 2,700 kg of drugs, with an approximate 
value of $13.5 million (1,849,500,000 bolivares) and hidden 
inside some aluminum ingots, were seized in New Jersey in 
December that same year. 
  Another shipment of aluminum poles was intercepted at 
Holland 
in February 1994. The structures contained 3,000 kg of cocaine 
valued at approximately $15 million (2.055 billion bolivares). 
The confiscation of other contraband in England was reported in 
April. The drug was hidden inside crude oil drums and had an 
approximate value of $375 million (51.375 billion bolivares). 
  Reports received this month indicate a drug laboratory 
dismantled in Cucuta, on the Venezuelan border, maintained 
average production of 400 kg of cocaine per week, meaning 20,800 
kg per year, at an average value of $104 million. 
<H5>  A STATE PRIORITY </H5>
  These issues were reportedly reviewed during the meeting 
attended by the state's high-ranking drug and security 
officials, who believe the problem should be handled as such. 
Regarding this issue, they discussed the possibility and 
advisability of assigning an Army division general as chairman 
of the National Commission Against Illegal Drug Use (Conacuid). 
This would clearly indicate the importance and essence of the 
problem for the country, and it would be an unequivocal sign to 
internal factors, foreign governments, and international 
organizations of the determination to face the problem as a 
threat to the Venezuelan state. 
  It was learned that the topics analyzed and proposals 
submitted on objectives, goals, and specific actions to be 
carried out at different periods would be briefed to the 
president of the republic yesterday afternoon, in a special 
report by Ministers Rafael Angel Montero Revette (defense) and 
Pompeyo Marquez (borders).

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom has described 
the rumor mill as a criminal tactic to undermine the country's 
prestige abroad and the calm of citizens. He noted that the 
rumor mill has been active these past few days, and that even 
the health of President Rafael Caldera has been questioned. 
  Escovar Salom gave no information on the inquiry conducted 
on 
a destabilization plan that includes this chain of rumors but 
termed them sources of unrest that seek to crumble the public's 
support for the Caldera government. He insisted this thing about 
the bogeyman is no cliche, but rather a conspiracy that involves 
a manipulation of the public and in no way is related to social 
unhappiness or protests over the water shortage. 
  [Begin Escovar Salom recording] Some people have made the 
absurd assertion that I want to explain the social crisis by 
blaming the bogeyman. I never said that. You are the first to 
know that is not so. You clearly heard what I said. The social 
crisis, which the government acknowledges, the economic crisis, 
and severe difficulties the country is experiencing is one 
matter. The manipulation and tactics by some sectors that have 
an interest in heightening the crisis and seeking other goals is 
another matter. That is what these sectors are trying to do. The 
events that took place over the weekend are clear proof that my 
remarks were serious and justified. I mean the rumor campaign. 
This rumor mill is criminal. I mean all these announcements of 
the future of the bolivar, devaluation, and alleged financial 
and fiscal measures the government is purportedly going to take. 
[end recording] 
  Commenting on the resignation of some members of the 
cabinet, 
Escovar Salom said any decision on the matter falls solely 
within the purview of President Caldera. On another matter, the 
Interior Minister commented on the border dispute between Merida 
and Zulia States. He noted this problem must be handled with 
utmost caution and prudence.

<F P=106> [Article by Freddy Torres] </F>
  [Text] The debate begun in MAS as it prepares for the 
party's national convention scheduled for 5 June is one big 
question mark. 
  Why did the number of votes won by MAS in the 1993 elections 
drop from 86,000 to 38,000 in Caracas and from 59,000 to 22,000 
in Miranda? Why did the party lose nearly 200,000 votes between 
1988 and 1993? Why did voters who cast their ballots for MAS in 
1988 fail to do so this time? Party leader Hector Perez Marcano 
is asking himself these very questions. 
  The debate will focus on alleged internal corruption, 
bureaucracy, and the organization's pragmatism, according to 
Moises Moleiro. 
  The Socialist leader claims that the ambiguity of the 
Movement Toward Socialism's positions makes it impossible to 
distinguish between MAS, Democratic Action (AD), and Copei 
[Social Christian Party]. 
  Moleiro says MAS's lack of political clarity was 
demonstrated 
on 4 February 1992, when the orange party yielded to the 
position taken by Social Democratic and Social Christian leaders 
defending the discredited government of Carlos Andres Perez. 
  In contrast, Rafael Caldera detected the causes of the 
military uprising and stated that one could not ask the people 
to come out in defense of a democracy that is starving the 
people. 
  Moleiro recalled that following the riot on 4 February, a 
committee was set up to review the position taken by MAS on such 
a crucial chapter of history. The Socialist leader expressed his 
discomfort because that committee pigeonholed the conclusions of 
the work and thus rejected the debate that the majority of MAS 
members were anxiously awaiting. 
  Moleiro, who ran for the presidency of MAS in past elections 
and who now seems inclined to back Victor Hugo D'Paola's 
candidacy for the office of secretary general of the party, thus 
touches upon a sore point. 
  He says it is a matter of pure politicking or alliances of 
convenience between MAS leaders and the representatives of 
certain economic groups. Without sparing criticisms, he has 
aimed his fire at Aragua Governor Carlos Tablante, whom he 
accuses of accepting financial backing from an economic group 
tainted by scandal. 
  He condemned the fact that in Aragua, the MAS ticket of 
deputies was headed by Manuel Capriles, brother of Manases 
Capriles, accused of the murder of Lorena Marquez. 
  He also criticized the fact that Capriles headed the list of 
deputies from Aragua even though the Office of Comptroller 
General had issued a report condemning his administration as 
government secretary. 
  The observations defended by Moleiro, Rafael Thielem, Jorge 
Valero, and Hector Perez Marcano include one concerning the 
alleged rigging of the last internal election. 
  Moleiro says, in connection with "the selection of 
candidates 
for deputy from the state of Miranda in May of 1990, in 
Barlovento alone, the winners gathered more votes than those 
obtained by MAS in the 1993 national elections." 
  To the charge of election rigging, Perez Marcano adds that 
of 
improper leadership of the political organization. 
  Moleiro cites this factor as the reason why the party 
increased its membership by a scant .5 percent in five years. 
  "If things continue in this fashion, it will take MAS 10 
more 
years to grow by one point," the Socialist leader figures. "If 
everything remains the same, MAS will have to wait a century to 
increase its votes by 10 percent," he warns. 
  The election stagnation experienced by MAS probably stems 
from the fact that the party's national leadership has not 
understood the changes that have occurred in Venezuela in recent 
years, Perez Marcano points out. 
  "This explains why a party such as Cause R, which was tiny 
in 
January 1992, has leapfrogged over MAS, relegating us to fifth 
place," Moleiro reflects. 
  "The reason why MAS lost its way seems to be its pragmatism 
and the lack of clarity of the leadership headed by Freddy 
Munoz, Moleiro claims. 
  In Perez Marcano's opinion, the ambiguity of MAS policies 
has 
prevented the organization from capturing voters abandoning AD 
and Copei. 
  Reformers within MAS say that what is needed is a return to 
the times when the party was essentially a critic and questioner. 
  This position has gained strength considering that MAS has 
come to be a government party and that, if it is not careful, it 
will become paralyzed, no longer a factor in social struggles. 
  This possible danger is a risk that MAS can ill afford 
because it is a party that proclaims itself to be an alternative 
force for change, some members of MAS believe. 
  "Without an in-depth debate that faces problems squarely and 
includes all members, the effects may be irreparable," Moleiro 
warns. 
  Manuel Isidro Molina, candidate for the office of secretary 
general of MAS in Caracas, says the party should not shrink from 
debate and that it would be impardonable if such issues were to 
be discussed in secret meetings. 
  "Venezuelan society does not deserve to have political 
parties debate the issues behind closed doors, particularly when 
the other side is proclaiming that the aberrations and 
distortions of Venezuelan democracy must be debated 
democratically." 
  Teodoro Petkoff refuses to debate the crisis in MAS, arguing 
that these are internal matters that should be discussed 
privately. 
  Argelia Laya, president of the party, has also condemned the 
position of those promoting a public discussion of MAS's 
internal affairs. 
  Speaking from the critical faction, Rafael Thielem blames 
MAS 
Secretary General Freddy Munoz for the election stagnation 
suffered by that political organization. 
  Munoz, who cannot be elected secretary general for more than 
two terms because the statutes do not permit it, hopes to ascend 
to the presidency in order to conceal his errors and back a man 
he trusts for the office, his adversaries say.

  [Text] MAS Secretary General Freddy Munoz admits that his 
political organization has made mistakes and believes this was 
one factor preventing the party from winning the majority 
backing of Venezuelans dissatisfied with the policies of the 
most recent administrations. 
  Nevertheless, Munoz expresses faith in the possibility of a 
profound change in MAS that will restore the party to its 
leading role in society. Despite his recognition that MAS did 
not win most of the votes cast by persons disillusioned with 
Democratic Action and Copei, he says it is absurd to claim that 
the party suffered a defeat in the elections held on 5 December 
1993. 
  "The most relevant result of the most recent elections was 
the victory of Rafael Caldera, and our party made a significant 
contribution to that success," Munoz argues. 
  Nevertheless, he admits that the victory did not have any 
substantial carryover in terms of MAS's election results. 
  Examining the reasons why progress of the Movement Toward 
Socialism was "modest," he concludes that this force "was not 
perceived as a distinct alternative to AD and Copei." 
  Munoz generally attributes this fact to errors in the 
adoption of certain lines. He cites the case of 4 February 1992, 
when Socialist leaders "failed to tell the truth expressed by 
Caldera concerning the following points: the circumstances under 
which the coup occurred and the impact which Carlos Andres 
Perez's disastrous government had on all of this." 
  Munoz believes that the line taken by MAS may possibly be 
explained by distortions occurring in the party in recent years. 
  "These deviations were the result of influence exerted on 
our 
organization by certain ideas, values, and habits that are 
characteristic of the dominant political forces," Munoz says. 
  He concludes that the eradication of such distortions is 
essential if the Movement Toward Socialism is to take its 
rightful place as a political alternative in Venezuela. 
  All in all, he believes that a number of MAS leaders 
exaggerate when they claim that the party's flaws are its main 
feature or its common denominator. 
  "I naturally bear unavoidable responsibility for mistakes 
made by the leadership over the past eight years," he says, "but 
what about the undeniable progress which MAS has made during my 
term as secretary general?" 
  Munoz suggests launching a debate concerning the 
transformation of the party. "The overall record is positive, 
but it is not sufficient to meet the great challenges that we 
face." 
  Munoz appealed for reform of the organization. Emphasizing 
"major limitations that have created a need for profound 
change," he recommends reviewing MAS's relationship to society 
and its capacity to make changes in its thought and internal 
life. 
  With respect to the Movement Toward Socialism's position on 
the government of President Rafael Caldera, he stresses that it 
should be guided by the principles of solidarity and autonomy. 
"This means loyalty to commitments shared and making the 
people's interests the top priority."

<F P=106> [Article by Freddy Torres] </F>
  [Text] Victor Hugo D'Paola, who lost his bid for the post 
of secretary general in the most recent party elections, is 
making another run. 
  D'Paola is from the group of the old Hawks led by Freddy 
Munoz and Teodoro Petkoff. He is now seeking the support of MAS 
members from the central states and of Vicente Bello, secretary 
general of MAS in Caracas. Another important figure in the 
orange ranks who has thrown support to him is Luis Manuel 
Esculpi. 
  Although D'Paola favors horizontal leadership and detests 
bossism, he is defined as a centralist. 
  Some of those questioned do not rule out the possibility 
that 
in the course of the campaign, D'Paola could gain the support of 
the party's four harshest critics: Moises Moleiro, Hector Perez 
Marcano, Jorge Valero, and Rafael Thielem. 
  Another candidate for the post of secretary general of MAS 
is 
Simon Garcia, who is proposing a change in party leadership and 
calling for a new discussion of the objectives originally 
outlined by this political force. 
  He supports changing MAS's name and seeks far-ranging change 
within the organization. 
  He is rallying the support of small regional factions that 
refuse to submit to directives from the national leadership. 
  He was very close to Freddy Munoz at the last National 
Convention, but seems to have drifted away from his chief. 
  A low-profile leader, Garcia has the support of Segundo 
Melendez, leader of the Socialist bench in Congress. He is also 
backed by MAS leaders from Lara and Zulia. 
  Another name on the list of candidates is that of Jorge 
Valero, who proposes a return to a leftist, revolutionary line. 
He joins critics of the political conduct of Carlos Tablante. 
  Valeiro enjoys the support of Socialist leaders in the 
interior and, it is said, of Moises Moleiro and Hector Perez 
Marcano. 
  One emergency option for resolving the crisis has emerged 
and 
gained the support of prominent MAS intellectuals: the candidacy 
of Enrique Ochoa Antich for the office of secretary general of 
MAS. Ochoa Antich has moral support because of his record as a 
human rights activist. 
  In the meantime, 6,500 MAS delegates waiting to attend the 
June convention are confident that they will set the course of a 
movement born when it split off from the Communist Party of 
Venezuela and proclaimed to change Venezuela without changing 
itself. 
  The MAS National Convention will elect party presidents, 
vice 
presidents and secretaries general at the national, regional, 
municipal, and parish levels. 
  It will also choose the delegates that will select the rest 
of the party officials for all other organs. 
  The last MAS convention counted nearly 250,000 members 
joined 
by the hope that the debate initiated will pull the organization 
out of its apathy. 
  Moleiro has already issued a warning: "Without an in-depth 
discussion, MAS will become a party without importance, a kind 
of orange URD [Democratic Republican Union]." 
  Carlos Tablante, governor of Aragua and a candidate for the 
presidency of MAS, has entered the race preaching for 
regionalism, a formula he believes can guarantee more democracy 
in the party. 
  "No longer is it only in Venezuela that figures in national 
politics are the target of discussion," he says, a reference to 
the national committee. 
  Tablante maintains that there is no coordination between the 
MAS National Executive Committee and regional leaders. 
  He claims that the national leadership of MAS is not only 
out 
of step with the regional structure of the party, but with the 
country's social dynamics as well. 
  Tablante's proposal has been rejected because some say it 
leads to the danger of little pockets of regional leaders and 
destroys the national purpose of the Socialist Party that was 
born 23 years ago. 
  Tablante's position favors changing MAS's name because the 
term "socialism" is associated with totalitarianism and 
authoritarianism. 
  It is not likely that Tablante's statements will gain any 
following because the governor of Aragua has many opponents who 
condemn his connection with the Capriles economic consortium. 
  One of Tablante's critics is Hector Perez Marcano, who 
claims 
that the weakening of MAS's national political program has given 
rise to a misinterpreted regional autonomy. 
  Marcano says the development of regional political 
leaderships has not consolidated MAS as a party and that in some 
cases, the latter have done nothing but promote unfortunate 
alliances with the AD, Copei, and certain economic groups. 
  To support his claim, he cites one fact about Governor 
Carlos 
Tablante: Of the 1.6 billion bolivars in public works contracts 
awarded in Aragua, 70 percent went to companies in the Capriles 
group, in violation of the law on bidding. 
  Perez Marcano accuses Tablante of buying off AD and Copei 
lawmakers during the last term in order to put together a 
majority in the Legislative Assembly. 
  MAS thus moves toward internal elections marked by visible 
internal problems.

  [Text] Caracas, 15 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Venezuelan 
Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(Fedecamaras) said today it is pleased with the conclusion of 
the negotiations that will lead to the signing of a free trade 
agreement by the Group of Three (G-3). 
  Edgar Romero Navas, president of Fedecamaras, the country's 
top business organization, told NOTIMEX that the G-3 will 
contribute to the creation of a single vigorous integration axis 
in Latin America. The G-3, which comprises Mexico, Venezuela, 
and Colombia, concluded last Thursday negotiations over a broad 
trade agreement, which will potentially benefit a population of 
nearly 140 million people. Nava added that the implementation of 
the G-3 agreement will allow other countries to make trade 
connections with the Andean Pact and tighten relations with 
countries such as Chile, which has reached agreements with 
Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico. 
  The trade relations, which will be in full gear after the 
agreement is signed by the presidents of the three countries and 
ratified by their respective congresses, represent one third of 
the economies of Latin America and the Caribbean. 
  Industrialists from the chemical and textile sectors, who 
were opposed to the original draft of the agreement and who in 
fact prolonged the technical negotiations, were also pleased 
with the terms of the final agreement reached by the ministers 
of the three countries. Luis Brizuela from the textile sector 
and Pedro Carmona from the chemical industry sector said during 
telephone interviews that new opportunities are opening up which 
should be explored by all Venezuelan industrialists. Carmona 
said the agreements reached were well programmed because even 
though rigid norms were accepted for the chemical industry 
sector, the agreement to supervise the supply situation by means 
of the Regional Supply Committee, was the most viable. 
  The G-3 will generate a GDP that will be nearly 35 percent 
of 
the region's total and its exports of goods and services 
represent more than 40 percent of the region's total exports. 
The G-3 imports represent nearly 45 percent of the total, a 
demand that will bring opportunities for each of the three 
countries that will sign the agreement on 15 June in Cartagena 
de Indias, Colombia. 
  Carmona said the chemical industry sector came up with a 
formula to deal with the fundamental aspects of supply. In the 
textile industry sector, the problem will be prolonged for only 
two more years. Brizuela indicated that the decision to exclude 
textile products from the deregulation program was the least of 
the evils that could be chosen in view of the danger of the 
negotiations falling apart.

  [Text] Conflict over the mechanisms implemented to end the 
fall of the bolivar against the dollar continues. While the 
Economic Cabinet has blamed the Central Bank of Venezuela for 
the ineffectiveness of the measures applied in this regard, 
Central Bank President Antonio Casas Gonzalez recalled that the 
mechanisms for intervening in the banks was evaluated and 
accepted by the executive branch. 
  Additionally, there are differences over control exchanges 
between Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez and Asdrubal 
Batista, minister for reforming the national economy. In this 
regard, Casas Gonzalez admitted that the auction of foreign 
currency will not resolve in itself the expectations of the 
public but that this would depend on the policies on banking, 
fiscal, and public order problems that convey credibility to the 
community.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Coordination and Planning Enzo </F>
del Bufalo by Alfredo Carquez Saavedra; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The following are some of the most important 
macroeconomic indices the administration of President Caldera 
hopes to achieve between 1994 and 1995: 
  --Average interest rates of 45 percent in 1994, and 35 
percent in 1995. 
  --Price increases of 35 percent, at a maximum, in the first 
year, and 28 percent, at a maximum, in the second year. 
  --Economic growth of 1.5 and 2.5 percent, for the respective 
years. 
  --Negative fiscal deficits of 2.9 and 1.5 percent, for the 
respective years. 
  However, a large part of the hope of achieving these, or 
even 
better, goals depends on the series of sectorial agreements the 
government has decided to promote. 
  Enzo del Bufalo, who heads the CORDIPLAN [Office of 
Coordination and Planning], says that this is not a matter of a 
disagreement. "It is, instead, a negotiation of an almost 
mercantile sort between the government and some of the economic 
actors. There is a chain in which macroeconomic problems and 
microeconomic actions are intermingled, and they will be 
discussed by those who have to deal with them. Because what the 
one provides not only benefits both parties, but also gives rise 
to positive effects for the other participants. For example, if 
the executive branch eliminates the fiscal deficit, this will 
allow the Central Bank of Venezuela to alter the monetary 
policy." 
  [Saavedra] Would this mean elimination of the zero coupon 
bonds? 
  [Del Bufalo] Among other things, there would be no reason to 
issue more zero coupons. It will then be able to finance a plan 
to improve the solvency of the financial system, instead of 
using the resources as is being done now, because the present 
monetary policy is a residual policy. In other words, this 
institution simply finds itself faced with an economic policy 
being pursued for its own sake. 
  But if the executive branch eliminates the deficit, the 
pressure to effect a possible devaluation for fiscal reasons 
will disappear. And this also sets aside one of the reasons for 
the purchase of dollars. Nor would there be a need to impose 
high interest rates. 
  [Saavedra] What contributions would the business sector have 
to make? 
  [Del Bufalo] Two specific things will be asked of it in this 
negotiation. The first is at least partial absorption of the 
impact of inflation. This means refraining from passing on the 
increase in costs to the final prices, so that inertial 
inflation is eliminated. The other thing that will be required 
is that the reactivation of production be initiated. All of this 
would contribute to a change in what will be received as a 
benefit--a very low real interest rate. 
  [Saavedra] And what will the workers be asked to do? To 
moderate their wage demands? 
  [Del Bufalo] What can be required of the workers is 
something 
very concrete--that they be ready for a change in the social 
welfare system to a different mode--one better adapted to the 
enterprises, in exchange for receiving an increase in real wages. 
  [Saavedra] Is there some concrete proposal in this regard? 
  [Del Bufalo] There are various proposals. But the idea is 
not 
for the government to impose them, but for the workers to 
negotiate them to their full satisfaction. The executive branch 
will serve only as an intermediary. What we will contribute 
directly in this connection, however, is a real offer to create 
an entire overall social security system. 
  [Saavedra] What will happen to the accumulated social 
allocations? 
  [Del Bufalo] They represent an acquired right. What could be 
done is to pay off those who want to change the system they use. 
  [Saavedra] When will the negotiations begin? 
  [Del Bufalo] When the preliminary talks in which we are 
engaged with the interested parties have been concluded. I 
believe that this will actually occur within two or three weeks, 
at the latest. 
  [Saavedra] What leads you to believe that progress will be 
made with these agreements? 
  [Del Bufalo] These agreements have strictly economic goals. 
It is neither a question of supporting nor of opposing the 
government. What is intended is to stabilize five variable 
economic factors. 
  [Saavedra] Is it your belief that this represents not only 
the last chance, but also the only possible formula? 
  [Del Bufalo] This is the only way to proceed at a low social 
cost. And if Venezuela wants to avoid more suffering, this is 
the formula that will ensure less suffering. Because this 
alternative has the advantage of requiring no sacrifice in 
addition to those we have undergone, and it translates into 
direct benefits for each of the participants within a very short 
time. 
  Now, if the economic sectors in Venezuela are not able to 
negotiate an agreement that makes it possible to stabilize the 
economic variables while at the same time obtaining net profits, 
we will have to have recourse to the traditional mechanisms. 
These are the mechanisms of the classic type that lead to 
foreign-exchange and price controls, resulting in a slowing of 
the structural change in the economy, without any certainty that 
it will proceed in the long run. Or, there are those of a 
neoliberal sort that mean drastic devaluation with high interest 
rates. This would also slow the growth of the economy and would 
cause the population more pain. 
  [Saavedra] Is it true that the executive branch has 
considered avoiding the use of foreign financing for 1994 and 
1995? 
  [Del Bufalo] An effort will be made to avoid any increase in 
the debt. But a maximum indebtedness level for 1994 has already 
been approved in the national budget, and a comparable debt 
ceiling for 1995 is being analyzed. 
  [Saavedra] What is the amount of each of these figures? 
  [Del Bufalo] That for this year comes to approximately 
275.455 billion bolivares, and that for 1995 to about 140 
billion bolivares. However, the figure for 1994 represents the 
maximum for the fiscal deficit, which we hope will come to no 
more than 2.9 percent of the gross domestic product. 
  [Saavedra] But is the government fearful of using foreign 
financing, or is this regarded as just another tool? 
  [Del Bufalo] What we have is a policy of avoiding any 
increase in the net indebtedness. However, payments on the 
debts, as well as the contracting of others, will continue. The 
strategy of reducing indebtedness involves trying to reduce, to 
a minimum, the financing of expenditures through the use of this 
tool. 
  [Saavedra] Is it true that the executive branch is going to 
propose an amendment to the Privatization Law that would limit 
the use of the funds obtained by this means exclusively to the 
reduction of the foreign debt? 
  [Del Bufalo] A proposal that the privatization resources be 
used only to pay off debts and to invest in new assets has been 
put forth, and it seems a very sensible one to me. The problem 
is that rather than slowing privatization pending the passage of 
a new law, it would be better to continue working with the norms 
we have now, because the privatization program must be carried 
out with a certain speed.

  [Text] In Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 13 June, ALADI 
[Latin American Integration Association] will formalize a 
protocol that will permit Mexico to remain an ALADI member and 
at the same time be a member of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA). 
  The Council of Foreign Ministers, which is ALADI's top 
executive organ, will hold a special meeting to address the 
subject during a session that the Committee of Representatives 
has summoned to that effect. 
  The foreign ministers will formally approve the agreement 
that high-ranking officials reached in Montevideo on 3 May. The 
agreement provides for the granting of a special permit or 
waiver [preceding word in English] for ALADI members to form 
partnerships with developed countries. 
  The ALADI treaty sets forth that members must give other 
members the same benefits that they grant to countries outside 
ALADI, but Mexico, after joining the United States and Canada, 
was unable to fulfill this condition. Consequently, an 
interpretation document was drawn up permitting an exception for 
the members that join developed countries, in return for 
commercial compensations to the other ALADI members. 
  Cartagena de Indias was chosen as the place for holding the 
meeting at the invitation of the Colombian Government.

<F P=106> [Article by Aureliano Biancarelli] </F>
  [Text] Latin American representatives fear drug trafficking 
groups may be behind the international campaign to decriminalize 
and legalize narcotics. 
  "They use well-known international personalities to promote 
legalization," said lawyer Rodolfo Vielmann, 55, general 
coordinator of the Drug Prevention Council of Guatemala. 
  The concern with the decriminalization of drugs was 
expressed 
on 13 May in Sao Paulo during the last day of a meeting of Latin 
American drug prevention experts. 
  The forum was sponsored by the UN International Drug Control 
Program (UNDEP) and 40 experts from 17 countries participated. 
  Some participants suggested holding another UN meeting to 
exclusively discuss the subject of decriminalization. 
  Vielmann said some members of the U.S. Health Department 
defend the idea. In Colombia, some court sentences have 
considered the use of drugs a personal matter and an individual 
right. 
  "The court decisions of some countries worry us," said one 
participant who did not want to be identified. "Traffickers 
kill," he added. 
  Psychologist Jose Luis Harb, 34, the Bolivian Social 
Prevention under secretary, said the preaching in favor of 
decriminalization in Colombia is worrisome. He said that 
Bolivia is a drug producing country and this makes it different 
from the rest. "In my country cocaine base is very cheap and 
traffickers are interested in the foreign market. To 
decriminalize narcotics does not help at all." 
  Luis Carlos Zamora Reys, 37, the head of the Colombian 
National Narcotics Directorate, said that legislation in his 
country only tolerates drug addicts and worries with their 
recovery. 
  Sao Paulo First Lady Ika Fleury said: "The idea of 
decriminalizing narcotics is globally flourishing," adding: "If 
badly conducted, it will have serious consequences." She 
participated in the UNDEP closing ceremony as president of the 
Sao Paulo Solidarity and Social Fund. 
  Giovanni Quaglia, 43, UNDEP director in Brazil, said the 
legalization of drugs "is no solution, it is beginning to be 
defended because society believes all other measures have 
failed." He said that what is happening in some Latin American 
countries is a trend to decriminalize consumers and those who 
carry small amounts.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on a speech by Vice President Gonzalo </F>
Aguirre to the Uruguayan Chamber of Industries' Directors 
Council following his announcement that he will be a 
presidential candidate in the 1994 election; place and date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] Vice President Gonzalo Aguirre was received 
yesterday by the Uruguayan Chamber of Industries' Directors 
Council. He made a long speech on the current conditions 
affecting the manufacturing industry and on the basic measures 
the next government must implement to shore up industrial 
activities. 
  He began by saying that he generally believes in the 
government's economic policies, including the opening of the 
economy, Uruguayan participation in the regional integration 
project, and the struggle against the fiscal deficit and 
inflation. [passage omitted] 
  Aguirre said this concept could be applied to industrial 
policies and industries in general because when you seek 
prosperity and competitiveness it is not merely to protect 
industrialists; it is to ensure the contribution of industry to 
society and its capacity to create genuine jobs and general 
well-being. [passage omitted] 
  Aguirre talked about the role of the state in society. He 
said: "The state should not suffocate private companies with 
regulations, bureaucratic requirements, state competition, and 
inefficient monopolies. The private sector is the power behind 
economic development." 
  He added: "The state should not, however, become a 
spectator--leaving each individual free to do as he pleases--or 
abandon individuals--even if their efforts are not in the 
interests of society as a whole." 
  Aguirre said: "The state must decide on priorities, 
establish 
controls, orient, stimulate, and simultaneously discourage 
certain activities through credits, tax exemptions, or foreign 
exchange rates. These are just a few of the ways the state can 
guide economic activities." 
  He dismissed the idea that Uruguayans are pessimistic, 
reluctant to change habits and mental dispositions, or that the 
small size of the country hinders growth. 
  Talking about the concerns of industry, "government 
officials, and those of us who wish to govern the country for 
the next five years," Gonzalo Aguirre said that the so-called 
"unreal foreign exchange rate" and the loss of competitiveness 
it causes despite the undeniable industrial increase in 
productivity "are real factors." He added, however, that the 
situation did not follow a deliberate government policy. On the 
contrary, "had the Central Bank not intervened, the difference 
would be much greater," Aguirre said. [passage omitted] 
  Aguirre said Central Bank policies on foreign exchange have 
been contradictory because of the general decisions implemented 
by this government. "If the market determines prices, the value 
of the dollar--which is just one type of merchandise--should be 
freely determined by the market. We should not intervene, 
creating an artificial demand," said Aguirre referring to the 
Central Bank purchase of dollars when the exchange rate falls 
due to a lack of demand. 
  Aguirre said the solution is not to implement an abrupt 
devaluation "on which there is general consensus, except for 
some groups." Devaluation would temporarily bring the exchange 
rate to more realistic levels but it would also affect the 
prices of all products, Aguirre added. 
  Aguirre said: "The solution is not simple, but I would 
support a proposal to let the dollar float freely. There would 
be little risk that the foreign exchange rate will fall 
drastically, given our market conditions. Besides, inflation 
will also drop when the Central Bank stops issuing money to 
intervene in the market (through monetary contention)." 
  The vice president admitted that to be competitive we must 
reduce inefficiencies in industry as well as in the state, and 
possibly seek a compromise between devaluation and inflation. 
  Aguirre then talked about the need to reform the state. He 
said the problem is not just the size of the state. The real 
problem centers on operating costs, public spending structures, 
and the fiscal pressure to finance an oversized state. He said 
the state influences costs when it determines public utility 
rates, the price of gasoline, interest rates through the Bank of 
the Republic, bus fares, insurance rates, taxes, and social 
security contributions. 
  He said the government has been implementing measures to 
reduce the size of the state as of 1990. In some ways it has 
succeeded and in some ways it has not, partly due to resistance 
to change by politicians and the population. 
  Aguirre said that despite some progress, the state as a 
whole 
continues to be inefficient and the cost of this inefficiency is 
transferred to local consumers and foreign consumers in the case 
of products we export. 
  Among the reforms, Aguirre mentioned the social security 
system, which must be reformed without altering acquired rights. 
He said that workers compensations (family subsidies, health 
insurance, unemployment insurance, etc.) must be corrected 
because they do not have genuine financing, as should the funds 
that operate in the red--particularly rural funds. These items 
are a burden on the Industry and Commerce Fund (which operates 
in the black) because they prevent it from lowering costs. 
[passage omitted] 
  Aguirre said other factors harming industries are the 
compensatory mechanisms, which do not exist or are insufficient 
to face direct or indirect protectionist policies. 
  Aguirre said: "Tariff reductions implemented within the 
framework of the Asuncion Treaty [which created the Common 
Market of the South, Mercosur], or practiced in general in a 
gradual manner, are not bad and the productive apparatus has 
accepted them. What is unreasonable is to implement them under 
unfair or unequal conditions without full reciprocity inside and 
outside Mercosur." 
  The vice president said Uruguay must adopt compensatory 
mechanisms when Argentina and Brazil adopt protectionist 
measures against Uruguayan exports through their statistic rates 
or other mechanisms. He added that this does not mean we will 
abandon the policy of economic opening. They will be implemented 
only to prevent suffering undue and unnecessary damage. 
  Aguirre closed his speech by citing some items of what could 
be a considered a tentative Program of Industrial Policy as of 
1995. 
  Objective: 
  A. To create the minimum conditions for industries to 
compete 
in the international market. 
  B. To maintain policies to cover the entire field, seeking 
competitiveness among our industries without neglecting official 
support to specific groups. 
  C. To increase worker training in new technologies. 
  D. To reform the state. 
  E. To reform the Social Security System, the tax system, and 
interest rates, and to eliminate state monopolies. 
  F. To introduce flexibility into the labor market. 
  G. To continue the program of economic opening and regional 
integration on the basis of reciprocity and compensatory 
mechanisms for specific situations.

  [Text] The Spanish courts yesterday sent to the Uruguayan 
courts a rogatory letter so that the detained Basques might be 
interrogated on incidents linked to the cases that prompted 
their extradition petitions. 
  The Spanish courts' petition has prompted a new controversy 
at the judicial branch level, as the interrogatories must 
include all Basque citizens who are allegedly ETA [Basque 
Homeland and Liberty] members, whether or not their extradition 
has been approved. 
  One of the cases included in the petition was approved, and 
this elicited a reaction from the defense attorneys of those 
involved. 
  Attorney Gustavo Puig has filed remedies of appeal and 
appeals for annulment. The legal issue now will therefore have 
to be resolved by the Court of Criminal Appeals.

  [Text] Armed Forces commanders are fully committed to the 
complex issue of institutional reorganization as decided by the 
executive branch. There are many opinions regarding the 
possibility of implementing it within a short period of time, 
due to the lack of enough resources for the necessary purchases 
of modern equipment. The highest ranking military officers are 
also concerned about the reorganization's social and 
geopolitical aspects, which means that today you cannot depend 
on a single strategic line, or maintain a strict subordination 
to certain world hegemonic powers which are always changing. 
  Commanders are also studying the diverse effects of the deep 
political changes in the world with the disappearance of the 
Soviet Union and communism. Many people do not hesitate to 
affirm that these changes have deeply affected our Armed Forces. 
We no longer have the "cold war" or the "East-West axis" and 
have again begun to speak about the importance of the 
"North-South axis," "which seeks to maintain countries such as 
Uruguay in strict dependency of the North." High-ranking 
military sources told LA MANANA that the affair raises questions 
not only about the future equipping of our Armed Forces, but 
also about its "acting philosophy and its professional morale 
and ethics," the sources said. 
  Confirming their well-known resistance "to be merely used as 
border forces," the spokesman ratified that "we will never, no 
matter the order, replace the police. Before we are required to 
intervene in internal problems, we need an appropriate law 
protecting soldiers following orders, officers giving those 
orders, citizens who should be protected from probable abuse, 
and "the institutions." 
<H5>  The Cost of the Reform </H5>
  Confirming the real Armed Forces vision on the need to 
modernize the institution and on the concrete economic reality 
of the country, the sources said: "We are well aware of our real 
needs. If we ask for a brigade with significant firing power, 
adequate deployment speed, safe communications, and modern 
equipment, we know we will need millions of dollars. But we are 
also aware of the real situation of the country, and of the 
social and political priorities. What, then, should we do? 
  That question seems to be at the center of the delay in 
producing the report that President Luis Alberto Lacalle had 
requested within the next 90 days. 
  The sources do not hesitate to say that the report will be 
presented in time, and in the correct form, "because we will 
fulfill the order." There is no doubt, however, that the 
country's and the Armed Forces' reality will require "another 
time and a different focus" to be able to also answer to the 
deep changes in regional, continental, and world political 
geography. 
<H5>  The Reorganization </H5>
  The internal Armed Forces reorganization has begun 
principally in the Army. Many services have been "grouped under 
a single command," while many other offices have not been 
touched. In some cases they even returned to their former 
department heads. 
  The Air Force has very few planes still operating, but it 
will be receiving various kinds of planes, including two 
Hercules transport planes that will be donated by the United 
States. 
  Our ground forces have the greatest problem. This is the 
branch with the largest number of personnel who "will not be 
separated from the institution. They will be redistributed 
within the Defense Ministry. Reliable sources said that the 
institution is studying new incentives for the voluntary 
retirement program. The situation is being analyzed carefully 
because it might affect the financial situation of the Military 
Retirement and Pensions Fund, the organization that will be 
responsible for paying pensions to those who retire. 
  According to government sources, the president wants the 
Armed Forces reorganization ready for August in order to 
implement the mechanisms approved by the high-ranking military 
commanders during October at the latest.

  [Text] The plenary gathering of the People's Councils of 
the city of Havana was held today in this capital. Here is 
correspondent Pepe Suarez with the details. 
  [Suarez -- live or recorded] A plenum of the People's 
Councils in the capital's administration was held here today, 
with provincial people's council presidents participating. The 
ministers of Public Health, Tranportation, and Communications 
were invited to this work session, which analyzed the new forms 
for the distribution and sale of medications, the recovery of 
raw materials, and the sensitive spheres of urban transportation 
and telephones. 
  Plenum participants learned about the creation of 23 new 
pharmacies to attend to emergency cases in the city's hospital 
network, and about the linking of consumers to the 335 
pharmacies in the capital according to the area in which the 
consumer resides. 
  In connection with urban transportation, the process of 
integrating the so-called "train-buses" [tren-bus] into the 
capital's traffic network was analyzed, as was the process of 
investments being made by Mitrans [Ministry of Transportation] 
with the goal of progressively improving passenger 
transportation. 
  In connection with telephones, things related to the 
deactivation of illegal telephones and the so-called clandestine 
calls were discusssed, as well as everything concerning the 
public telephone network. The new businesses houses to buy raw 
materials (?from) the population, and the sale to residents of 
the capital of things produced by the local industries completed 
the agenda of the participants in the plenum of the People's 
Councils of the city of Havana. 
  This is Pepe Suarez for Rebelde's Exclusivo program.

<F P=106> ["Reflections" commentary by Fernando Davalos] </F>
  [Text] A few days after the historic May Day session of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government, as the next step, 
a meeting of presidents of People's Government Administrative 
Councils from all the provinces and the special municipality of 
the Isle of Youth was held. The meeting, chaired by Lage, 
Machado Ventura, and Alarcon, discussed the budget, 
self-employment, local industries, the illegal sale of homes and 
vehicles, and other issues. As you can see, some of these issues 
are very current and of great interest. Nevertheless, I would 
like to focus on the budget alone. 
  Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez gave good 
news at the meeting, although right now it consists only of 
promising indexes. Rodriguez stated that in general, the 
management of the budget in the provinces in the first two 
months of 1994 shows encouraging signs. It is only a two-month 
period; nevertheless, it undoubtedly reflects that the imbalance 
-- which, as is often stressed hurts the country greatly -- is 
being corrected. 
  Fifty-one percent of the nation's budget is managed in the 
provinces -- in other words, administered by the local People's 
Government. The Administrative Councils are in charge of 
controlling it, ensuring that only the amount budgeted is spent 
and that revenues match anticipated income in order to reduce 
the imbalance between revenues and expenses, which surpasses 4.2 
billion pesos nationally and contributes to rarefying the 
national economy. 
  Jose Luis Rodriguez also stated that calculations showed 
that 
fewer expenses and greater revenues were being registered. This 
is even more healthy. Rodriguez pointed out that irksome 
subsidies were on the way out, and that in general terms, a 
reduction of 6 percent has taken place in the deficit. 
  Good news, just like hearing someone's fever is dropping. We 
cannot forget that this process has been called a healing of the 
internal finances. With an elevated budget deficit and an excess 
of currency nearing 12 billion pesos circulating, we have to 
admit that the national economy is experiencing problems similar 
to an illness. 
  Rodriguez announced that so far Holguin, I might add, is the 
only province in the black in terms of revenues. In other words, 
it spends less than what it contributes to the budget. He also 
mentioned Cienfuegos, Las Tunas, Granma, and Santiago de Cuba 
Provinces as having a similar situation, but being supported by 
state subsidies. 
  Another bit of news was that billing and payment management 
has improved. Minister Rodriguez stated that unsettled accounts 
diminished by 440 million pesos during the first quarter of 
1994. Even better. However, the most important thing is that on 
this occasion guidelines were drafted to ensure that financial 
indiscipline does not make a comeback, because it would be 
unacceptable for this to reoccur in the provinces, where the 
finances are blooming much taller and stronger.

<F P=106> [Interview with Panamanian Minister of Foreign Relations </F>
Roberto Robaina by unidentified LA JORNADA reporter; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [LA JORNADA] There are a number of economic 
reforms under way in your country that were unthinkable just a 
few years ago. Why are these reforms being made? How will you 
overcome the democratic deficit, given that the single party 
system only offers Cuban voters one option? 
  [Robaina] I don't think one can analyze these issues outside 
the context in which the people live, work, and develop. I am 
not saying our democracy is perfect, but we do have our own 
special democratic system. No one has been able to show me that 
any other model is perfect. In some countries, 70 percent of 
the eligible voters stay away from the polls out of 
indifference. I respect all versions of democracy and only ask 
that people respect ours. We will see how many things can be 
discussed regarding models and modes of popular participation as 
soon as my country is out from under the foreign threat hanging 
over us. Our form of democracy is not what it was five years 
ago, and it will surely be different five years from today. We 
are currently working on ideological pluralism. It is more a 
pluralism for participation than a pluralism of parties. 
  [LA JORNADA] What can you tell all those sectors, including 
the intellectual left wing, which believe that the blockade 
benefits Fidel Castro inasmuch as it helps him when it is time 
to fall in line and defend the revolution against foreign 
threats? 
  [Robaina] If lifting the blockade means overthrowing Fidel 
(Castro), as many so absurdly propose, the blockade would have 
been lifted by now. One cannot associate the existence of a 
political system with the blockade. The blockade is against an 
entire population that has been sentenced to die of hunger and 
disease. 
  [LA JORNADA] Has there been any kind of progress to indicate 
that the tension between Cuba and the United States is 
weakening, opening the way to normal relations? 
  [Robaina] There is no reason for excessive enthusiasm. We 
have publicly stated that this (U.S.) Administration does not 
display the constant aggression of past administrations. That 
in and of itself means very little, but it could create a 
certain atmosphere. Although the aggression is absent, there 
are other things indicative of a certain stagnation, such as the 
tightening of the blockade by the Torricelli Bill and the failed 
U.S. attempt to prevent the United Nations from discussing this 
issue. We see no indications that relations are heading toward 
a major change. I think this administration was highly 
committed when it came to office. I do not think it is a matter 
of what they want to do but a matter of what they really can do. 
  [LA JORNADA] From a distance, the economic reforms you are 
implementing have a certain smell of neoliberalism; shock 
measures. Don't you think this new direction could shatter the 
consensus you seem to enjoy among the people? 
  [Robaina] To say that the people are adjusting easily to 
these measures would be untrue. We are conducting a persuasion 
campaign, explaining the reasons behind the changes neighborhood 
by neighborhood. There are already some measures in effect that 
have a high social and political cost. A large portion of the 
population did not welcome the decision to legalize foreign 
currency after 30 years of working in the opposite direction 
because they were taught a different way of thinking. That 
measure is just another way of keeping our feet on the ground, 
as there are more and more people with a working relationship 
with foreign investment every day. We concluded that if 10 
million people are unable to solve the situation we are facing 
but 5 million are able to do it, then we must decide to make a 
sacrifice and somehow create the social differences to which we 
are unaccustomed. 
  [LA JORNADA] What guarantees will foreign investors have 
that their properties will not be seized by the state? 
  [Robaina] We have given foreign investment constitutional 
support through regulations that are flexible enough to include 
everyone and every circumstance. In addition, we are not 
interested in meddling in any area, especially the economic one. 
Under no circumstances will we risk foreign investment. Some 
even wonder what would happen if Cuba returned to capitalism. 
Even if that happened it wouldn't entail any shocks for 
businessmen because they would be in their element. 
  [LA JORNADA] Is a return to capitalism possible? 
  [Robaina] I don't think so. 
  [LA JORNADA] What then would be the middle ground between an 
unsuccessful socialist system and the capitalism you seem to 
dislike? 
  [Robaina] Cuba does not believe that there is any reason to 
turn back from what has been done. We want the Cuban project, 
as we have been planning and implementing it, to be viable. 
  [LA JORNADA] You are planning a meeting in Havana next year 
with a large segment of the Cuban exile community. Why now, 
after so many years and mutual ill will, is this meeting, which 
in some ways implies a national reconciliation, taking place? 
  [Robaina] The time is right whenever Cuban exiles overseas 
-- 
not just in the United States -- want to talk to us and meet 
with us in Cuba. It is very likely that a delegation from a 
group in that exile community will hold a positive meeting with 
us. The aforementioned group follows a moderate position, as 
opposed to the hostile attitude held by some toward Cubans who 
defend projects on the island. 
  [LA JORNADA] Do you mean that if prominent exiles such as 
Jorge Mas Canosa and Carlos Montaner changed their positions 
vis-a-vis the revolution, they could participate in this 
incipient dialogue? 
  [Robaina] Our prospects for dialogue do not depend on 
individuals but on positions. Anyway, we have so many 
relationships with people, groups, and sectors which have 
positions different from those advocated by Mas Canosa and 
Montaner that we do not need to consider talking to them. At 
any rate, I do not believe they are thinking of changing their 
position toward Cuba. Therefore, meeting with them doesn't make 
any sense.

  [Text] In the presence of some 700 tour operators, travel 
agents, and foreign and national reporters, the 15th 
international tourism convention, Cuba-94, opened today in 
Varadero. 
  Approximately 700 foreign delegates are attending the 15th 
tourism convention, which is considered the most important 
employment market. During a visit to the convention area, 
Tourism Minister Osmany Cienfuegos granted an interview to this 
station. 
  [Begin recording] There is a large group of foreign 
reporters 
as well as a large group of tour operators, businessmen, and 
travel agents who will help establish many of the contracts 
being discussed, and establish contacts for the supply of new 
products being manufactured. [end recording] 
  Minister Cienfuegos added that more than 700,000 tourists 
are 
expected to arrive in the country this year. Referring to 
development of the new Tourism Ministry, he said: 
  [Begin recording] Now the first steps are being taken; the 
Tourism Ministry has a small structure. We have decided to work 
first within the hotel chain structure, in organizing management 
cadres, et cetera. That is, this has almost been concluded, and 
all measures have been adopted concerning the organization; 
building sites for the chain of hotels, following the same 
styles as the Cubanacan and Gaviota enterprises. These are 
autonomous and independent organizations that will be given the 
same facilities granted to those institutions. Surely there will 
be a sound competition among them, which will guarantee that 
efficiency and professionalism will prevail in all management 
cadres because this is vital for the development of tourism. 
[end recording] 
  Until next Friday [20 May], 88 national and foreign 
companies, including 13 airlines, will promote and trade their 
products in this 15th conference.

  [Text] The 35th anniversary of the promulgation of the 
first Agrarian Reform Law in La Plata, Sierra Maestra, which for 
the first time in Cuban history gave the land to the people who 
worked it, is a time to reminisce and render homage. 
  Three veterans of the revolutionary struggle with ties to 
the 
agrarian sector -- Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, Jose Ramirez Cruz, 
and Conchita Fernandez -- today will receive the 17 May Order, 
the National Association of Small Farmers' [ANAP] top award, 
which is bestowed by the Council of State at the request of 
ANAP. The fact that to date only Commander in Chief Fidel Castro 
had received this order gives the presentation even greater 
importance, falling as it does on Peasants Day and the 
anniversary of the Agrarian Reform Law, especially since it is 
going to be presented during the closing session of the 
cooperative-peasant-scientific-technical meeting which began on 
16 May at the Olo Pantojas Communist Party of Cuba School in 
Havana. On this occasion, 10 cooperative workers and farmers 
will receive the Romarico Cordero medal and the Antero Regalado 
award.

  [Text] Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer has declared 
himself the winner of the presidential elections with a little 
over 43 percent of the votes counted, according to the ninth 
bulletin issued by the Central Electoral Commission of that 
country. The note states that more than 75 percent of the votes 
have already been counted. Balaguer leads his opponent Jose 
Francisco Pena Gomez by three points. 
  Reports indicate that the country remains quiet and that 
military patrols are more frequent in the face of electoral 
fraud claims, a claim also made in past elections. Pena Gomez, 
who is the candidate for the Dominican Revolutionary Party, the 
main opposition in the elections, stated that 200,000 of his 
followers were not allowed to vote. 
  [Begin recording] [Pena] I cannot say where this will end. 
We 
are talking about a fraud in the elections. The government and 
the Central Electoral Commission have an obligation to correct 
the situation. 
  [Balaguer] The elections have been fair. They claim that 
there has been so-called manipulation through the press, in 
complicity with foreign (?media). All these allegations must 
stand against the truth. The truth is stronger than anything.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Octavio Ochoa] </F>
  [Text] Fernando Gomez Mont, National Action Party [PAN] 
deputy and president of the Chamber of Deputies' Justice 
Commission, has described as "serious and unhealthy" the 
replacement of the attorney general because, he said, this 
change "reflects political and juridical instability in the 
country." Gomez Mont yesterday favored legal reforms to give the 
Attorney General's Office [PGR] full autonomy and detach it, 
once and for all, from the Executive's decisions. 
  Rene Bejarano Martinez, leader of the Party of the 
Democratic 
Revolution in Mexico City, has said that Diego Valades Rios' 
hasty dismissal "casts serious doubts on the government and the 
administration of justice in the country" and arouses the 
"permanent suspicion" that high officials are involved in drug 
trafficking, all of which heightens the climate of insecurity in 
Mexico. 
  All of these changes have altered the functions of the 
Attorney General and Mexico City's Federal Attorney General. It 
is time for this office to become fully autonomous and to be 
freed from the president's control, Gomez Mont said. He voiced 
his fears that Humberto Benitez Trevino, the new PGR head, will 
file away the Hank Gonzalez case permanently. 
  Gomez Mont said that Benitez is openly pro-Gonzalez and that 
all of Benitez' background consists of positions he held in the 
state of Mexico and SARH, [Secretariat of Agriculture and 
Hydraulic Resources] which was headed by Gonzalez. Apart from 
this, the change "is unhealthy" because it destabilizes the 
institution even further and reveals "a certain mismanagement" 
at the federal level. These changes give the impression of 
"messiness." Instead of benefiting the country, these changes 
harm it. 
  Finally, Gomez Mont refuted the report that his party 
pressured for Valades Rios' removal.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondents Salvador Guerrero Chipres and </F>
Jesus Aranda and ``special correspondent'' Aurelio Garibay] 
  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 15 May -- According to 
estimates made public by the Attorney General's Office (PGR), 
drug trafficking groups operating in Mexico will receive gross 
revenues totalling about $30 billion this year -- an amount that 
represents one-sixth of the value of annual cocaine consumption 
in the United States. 
  According to a confidential report prepared by the PGR and 
obtained by LA JORNADA, the annual drug market in the United 
States has expanded from $76 billion to $181 billion. Even the 
U.S. Senate narcotics subcommittee has reported that nearly $100 
billion originating from drug trafficking is held in U.S. banks. 
  According to the PGR, "the value of the world's illegal drug 
market is estimated at close to $500 billion," making it the 
underground financial sector with "the highest growth rate in 
the world." 
  Based on figures and documents prepared by the PGR, which 
have been reported to the president of the republic, and based 
on forecasts prepared by organizations such as the Hemispheric 
Information System for Narcotics Control (SHICD), which is "an 
intelligence network" designed to fight drug trafficking on the 
continent, it has been established that Mexico's crude oil and 
non- crude oil export revenues, in addition to the overall value 
of the nation's manufacturing industry, represent "an amount 
comparable" to the total gross revenues earned by domestic drug 
trafficking. 
  However, the portion of these revenues that remains in 
Mexico 
"is unknown, although most of it is thought to go overseas." 
  The previously mentioned amount is equivalent to four times 
the value of 1993 crude oil exports reported by the Bank of 
Mexico, which amounted to $7.418 billion. 
  In 1992, the federal government warned in a document 
entitled 
"Drug Control in Mexico" that resources controlled by narcotics 
traffickers and their gross revenues are capable of infiltrating 
any sector: "This calls for special attention in terms of 
protecting the nation's economy and, more important, the 
regional economy in order to prevent drug trafficking assets 
from becoming the nerve center of economic activity." 
  According to the same document, so far in 1994 the total 
revenues received by criminal organizations amount to nearly 
four times Mexico's total public and private foreign debt. 
Although significant, this amount must also be appreciated in 
terms of the material and human costs associated with operations 
leading to drug seizures. 
  One kilogram of high-grade cocaine in the U.S. retail market 
can be bought for a price ranging between $80,000 and $100,000. 
  Nearly 178 tons of cocaine where seized and destroyed during 
the first four years of this administration. 
  In October 1993, Morelos Governor Jorge Carrilo Olea said: 
"Drug trafficking has created its own culture, its own social 
structure, and its own safety controls, and, in some countries, 
it constitutes an element that influences and weighs heavily on 
society and the state, even threatening to subjugate them." Mr. 
Carrillo was at one time in charge of the PGR's Counternarcotics 
Office and also a presidential adviser specializing on drug 
related issues. 
  He also said: "The principle of profitability and capital 
return makes this phenomenon very different from other illegal 
practices. This is a criminal network which, following the 
pattern of an open and free market, assumes the shape of 
multinational corporations with a management, organizational, 
and operational structure that reflect pure business concerns." 
  Carrillo also pointed out that the enormous drive behind 
drug 
trafficking includes access to sizable financial assets and the 
illegal flow of resources that penetrate the economies of 
developing and consumer countries, as well as those nations that 
serve as bridges. In addition, there are the widespread 
international criminal organizations which "in some cases, 
infiltrate and erode government structures responsible for 
controlling them," such as has occurred in Mexico, according to 
a public acknowledgement by PGR authorities. 
  The third element is the constant association between drug 
trafficking and illegal weapons trafficking, "which constitutes 
a formidable threat to stability and regional peace, especially 
in the case of Latin America." 
  It is worth noting that several insurgent movements have 
been 
linked by various South American governments to weapons 
trafficking. 
  Here in Mexico, according to statements by Subcommander 
Marcos, the weapons used by the EZLN [Zapatista National 
Liberation Army] were purchased in the black market and include 
weapons seized by PGR agents from drug traffickers. The PGR has 
not commented on the rebel's statements. 
  In October 1993, General Carrillo Olea, who is also a former 
national security director, indicated: "The struggle waged by 
the police and the military against organized criminal 
organizations has upset society and shaken the political sector 
in a very significant way. Therefore, without denying the value 
of these resources, it is important to examine this carefully 
and to maintain the firm resolve to restrain its progression. 
The objective in this war is not to destroy the enemy, because 
this is impossible. The goal is to keep the enemy under 
control." 
  He added: "Wars against drugs trafficking expose 
institutions 
to ever-increasing risks of corruption. One of the most 
disappointing lessons of the campaigns waged against global drug 
trafficking has been to observe how institutions responsible for 
implementing the law are powerless against internal corruption 
campaigns staged by the drug lords. All contact with 
traffickers, even as enemies, increases the possibility of 
corruption."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 17 
May. 
  A Mexican Petroleum, PEMEX, spokesperson reported on 10 May 
the company registered a 4 percent increase in its production 
during the first two months of 1994 compared to the same period 
in 1993. Of the 2.71 million barrels a day it produced during 
that period, it exported 1.34 million to its clients in America, 
Europe, and Asia, while it refined the remainder to sell in 
Mexico as various petroleum products. During that period, the 
United States was the primary foreign client with 73.1 percent 
of the exports, followed by Spain with 11.2 percent, and Japan 
with 4.4 percent. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1735 GMT 10 May 94) 
  Foreign investment in the Mexican Stock Exchange, BMV, 
registered an 11.54 percent drop in the first four months of 
1994 caused by investors' nervousness over the country's 
political and social instability. Figures indicate that in 
January foreign participation reached $60,924,055,000, a 
historic level for the market, while in April, it dropped to 
$48,328,032,000. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 10 May 94 p 
18) 
  An analysis by the Confederation of National Chambers of 
Commerce, Concanaco, indicates that although tourism activity 
has improved, the number of tourists must increase, markets must 
be diversified, and the tourism infrastructure must be 
modernized so as to generate more revenue and create more jobs. 
It reported that 6.625 million tourists visited the country in 
1993, a 4.3 percent increase over 1992. (Mexico City EL 
FINANCIERO in Spanish 10 May 94 p 28) 
  Analysts of the Mexican Employers Confederation, Coparmex, 
indicated that the meager recovery and the critical situation of 
most of the micro, small, and medium-sized businesses prevents 
them from creating new jobs in the short term. Added to the 
elimination of jobs, this creates an employment outlook that is 
not very optimistic for 1994-1995. On the same subject, the 
National Processing Industry Association, Canacintra, maintains 
that this year at least 50 percent of the population entering 
the labor market will not find employment. The lack of a 
recovery in the national production sector, especially in 
industry, means that less than 500,000 new jobs will be created, 
compared to a demand for more than 1 million jobs. (Mexico City 
EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 11 May 94 p 28) 
  Telecommunications of Mexico, Telecomm, officials have 
admitted that this sector's obsolete infrastructure has led to 
economic losses difficult to quantify and underutilization of 
the demand for satellite and telegraph telecommunications. They 
added that this is why it must resort to privatization, 
modernization, or outright elimination of some of its services. 
Regarding ground stations for national television, Telecomm has 
253 but only 14 transmitters are in operation. Ninety percent 
are receivers, most of which were transferred by Televisa 
between 1980 and 1986 and are already obsolete. There are plans 
to modernize the center that monitors the quality of television 
signals because it is more than 20 years old. Regarding telex 
service, demand has fallen drastically due to its technological 
obsolescence, bad quality, and high cost. (Mexico City EL 
FINANCIERO in Spanish 11 May 94 p 11) 
  In the last three years, there has been an inconsistency 
between the economic policy of the National Development Plan, 
PND, and the evolution of the main macroeconomic variables, 
particularly the GDP. According to research by EL FINANCIERO, 
based on information from the National Institute of Geography, 
Statistics, and Data Processing, the gap between the government 
projections and the economic reality was influenced by the 
reduced presence of the main productive sectors in the domestic 
sector. Expenditures by the industrial sector registered a 5 
percent drop between 1989 and 1993 while those in the service 
sector grew only 0.8 percent in the same period. During the 
first three years of the current administration, the economic 
policy followed the authorities' plans and the evolution of the 
main indicators even surpassed the goals set initially. The GDP 
was expected to grow between 2.9 and 3.5 percent between 1989 
and 1992 but reality surpassed the projections, reaching an 
average of 3.8 percent. However, beginning in the second half 
of the six-year term, the macroeconomic variables entered into a 
difficult situation. In 1993, there was a 1.4 percent drop in 
investment. In order for the GDP to reach the level that was 
proposed in the PND, it will need to increase more than 9 
percent by the end of the year. This seems unlikely when one 
observes there were no satisfactory results in the economic 
recovery in the first quarter. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in 
Spanish 11 May 94 p 28) 
  The National Chamber of Commerce, Canaco, reported that 
retail sales in Mexico City dropped 40 percent during the first 
quarter. Retailers attributed the plunge to "social 
uncertainty" and "nervousness" among consumers. They see "no 
major recovery during the second quarter" as the current 
situation is expected to continue. The report lists toys with a 
54.4 percent drop, clothing in general with a 47.8 percent fall, 
jewelry with 45 percent, automotive parts with 43.7 percent, 
furniture and major appliances with 43.3 percent, and records 
and phonograph equipment with 42.9 percent. Canaco said that 
"small and medium businesses are especially susceptible to such 
adverse conditions." Some merchants reported that they were 
forced to lay off personnel, close branches, and adjust working 
hours. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 11 May 94 pp 1, 46) 
  The domestic debt "rose 32.5 percent from December 1993 to 
April 1994," according to a report issued by the Bank of Mexico. 
The report says that the federal debt rose to 220 billion 
pesos. The Treasury Secretariat and the BMV pointed out that 
"for every additional percentage point gained by Federal 
Treasury Certificates, the domestic debt increases at least 764 
million new pesos per year." (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 
11 May 94 pp 1, 48) 
  Carlos Hank Gonzalez, the secretary of agriculture and 
hydraulic resources, announced that the development banks "will 
invest 16.373 billion new pesos in 1994 to support production 
projects." The investment "will not only be in the area of 
loans, but in new technology for cattle farming, agriculture, 
finance, and marketing." In explaining the benefits that NAFTA 
will offer this sector, the secretary regretted that "we would 
have liked to see some import tax cuts for several other 
products," such as melons, watermelons, and several green 
vegetables, "but we must work with what we managed to agree on." 
(Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 11 May 94 pp 1, 49) 
  Chiapas State Government officials announced that they 
expect 
to pay approximately 954,000 new pesos a month to cattle 
breeders in Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las Margaritas, to 
compensate for land they lost to Indian occupations in the 
recent uprising. There are over 21,220 hectares of land 
involved in an agreement reached with the breeders, which totals 
8.59 million new pesos in compensation payments. Governor 
Javier Lopez Moreno said that "the government is capable and 
willing to solve the economic, political, and moral problems of 
the cattle breeders and the Indians alike." (Mexico City LA 
JORNADA in Spanish 11 May 94 p 9) 
  Pemex Director Francisco Rojas, in an interview with LA 
JORNADA, reported that the corporation is now ranked sixth in 
worldwide production figures. Rojas said that total production 
for 1994 will average 2.775 million barrels per day, 29,000 
higher than the 1982 record. He added that reserves total 
64.516 billion barrels of crude, estimated at $850 billion. It 
will be necessary to invest about $20 billion in order to 
maintain the current levels, "but that does not mean Pemex's 
doors will be left wide open to private domestic or foreign 
investment." (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 12 May 94 pp 
1,54] 
  Speaking before the Confederation of National Chambers of 
Commerce (Concanaco), Carlos Isoard, director of the Bank of 
Mexico's Commercial Development Fund, reported that the 
commercial sector's debt with development banks has increased 
nearly 200 percent so far in the current six-year period and is 
expected to increase another 100 percent in 1994. In five 
years, loans for this sector have increased by 686 percent. 
Concanaco presented a number of proposals to stimulate this 
sector, including the liberation of the financial ceiling, 
opening credit lines of as much as 50,000 new pesos, and 
establishing stopgap loans and preferential rates. Roberto 
Dieguez, director of the National Foreign Trade Bank, reported 
that the loans granted by the bank between 1989 and 1993 
increased 375 percent. The demand for credit is so heavy that 
more than 74,000 enterprises requested loans in 1993. (Mexico 
City LA JORNADA in Spanish 12 May 94 p 52) 
  The Bank of Mexico has reported that in March the nation's 
currency grew at an annual rate of 19.9 percent. The bank also 
reported that in March bank deposits increased by only 100 
million new pesos over the previous month. Over the same 
period, financing for the non-banking sector increased by 14.4 
billion new pesos. The amount of bills and coins in circulation 
increased 21 percent, and the amount checks increased 19.5 
percent. Two reasons were given for the increase in money in 
circulation: 1) abnormally low bank balances in 1993 because of 
the economic slowdown, which in turn led to lower interest rates 
paid to depositors; and 2) the heavy demand for currency in 
March. The bank also reported that in the first quarter of the 
year financial middlemen received 14.3 billion more new pesos 
from the public. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 12 May 
94 p 6) 
  Mexican Petroleum Director Francisco Rojas has said that 
larger crude oil production will depend on investment and that 
at least $20 billion will be required during the next five-year 
period. Nevertheless, he reported that the production of liquid 
petroleum products in 1994 will exceed the 1982 all-time record. 
The 1991-1994 average daily production will be 2.775 million 
barrels -- that is, 29,000 more barrels a day than in 1982 -- a 
figure that places Mexico as the world's sixth largest producer. 
Proven oil reserves on 31 December 1993 were 64.516 billion 
barrels of crude oil. At $13 a barrel, these reserves were 
valued at around $850 billion. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 
12 May 94 p 22) 
  The Mexican beef industry, unsubsidized and pressured by 
grain shortages, high interest rates, increasing beef imports 
spawned by NAFTA, and great commercialization difficulties, 
could very well go bankrupt if it is not placed on equal footing 
with the U.S. industry. Most of northern and northeastern 
Mexico's fattening businesses have gone under. The Mexican beef 
fatteners are alarmed. U.S. exporters plan to ship 
400,000-500,000 metric tons of beef, worth $1 billion, to Mexico 
by the year 2000. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 12 May 94 pp 
1, 22) 
  At a cost of more than $2.4 billion, the six units of the 
Federal Electricity Commission's Petacalco thermoelectric 
complex will become operational next month, according to plant 
Manager Isidro Bernal Salinas. The complex will meet the 
electric energy needs of 11.5 million people in the states of 
Michoacan, Guerrero, Colima, Morelos, and parts of Jalisco and 
Mexico. The plant, the largest of its kind in Latin America, 
can burn fuel oil and coal imported from Australia, Canada, and 
the United States. The plant will be connected to the national 
power grid in June or July through two 230,000-volt and three 
400,000-volt lines. Authorities say that on completion the 
plant will be capable of generating 18.396 billion kilowatts at 
full capacity. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 13 May 94 p 37) 
  The Chamber of Deputies has received a report from the 
Finance Secretariat saying that public finances show a surplus 
of 522 million new pesos for the January-March period. (Mexico 
City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 16 
May 94) 
  The Finance Secretariat has reported that Mexico's exports 
of 
assembly plant products to the United States and Canada 
increased by 24 percent and 29 percent, respectively, during the 
first two months of the year. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 
2058 GMT 16 May 94)

  [Text] San Jose, 16 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Two boats detained by 
the Sandinist People's Army [EPS], in Costa Rican territorial 
waters on Saturday, arrived today, Monday, at Barra del Colorado 
on Costa Rica's Caribbean coast. Meanwhile, the tourists 
returned last night on a commercial flight from Managua. 
  The capture of the yachts was downplayed by Costa Rican 
President Jose Figueres, who said it was "an unfortunate 
incident" that is a "residue of the more tense relations" Costa 
Rica and Nicaragua have experienced in the recent past. 
  The Nicaraguan military released yesterday eight persons -- 
five U.S. tourists and three Costa Rican crew members -- who 
were arrested by the EPS in the Barra del Colorado (Costa Rica) 
coasts, 240 km northeast of San Jose, while they were sports 
fishing. 
  Meanwhile, two "Navajo" aircraft sent by the Costa Rica 
Expeditions tour company, owner of one of the yachts, remained 
in Nicaragua because "fuel had to be transported from here 
(Costa Rica), as the military did not supply us," company 
executive Javier Salazar told ACAN. 
  The aircraft transported from Bluefields [Nicaragua] company 
personnel and reporters "who had to return on a commercial 
flight last night from Managua," with the released tourists, 
Salazar assured. 
  The company executive said the Nicaraguan immigration 
authorities released the tourists and the crew "without any type 
of explanation." 
  All those involved in the incident from the Costa Rican side 
said that the capture took place in Costa Rican waters off the 
Barra del Colorado coast, in the Caribbean. 
  The Nicaraguan military version indicates that the tourists 
were in Nicaraguan jurisdiction, 10 miles north of the border 
with Costa Rica. Therefore, they proceeded to arrest them. 
  The detained, all U.S. citizens, were identified by Costa 
Rican police as Ted Mucium, Frank Vanderburght, Brian 
Brouckaert, and Erick and Parl Becker. They were travelling on 
the yachts "Bull Shark" and "Guapote," commandeered by Costa 
Ricans Luis Torres, Wally Wallace, and Roberto Graund.

<F P=106> [Report by Luis A. Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- The government will not negotiate 
with international financial organizations to continue the 
economic adjustment program imposed by Rafael Leonardo Callejas' 
administration. It will instead present its own proposal, which 
has been coordinated with different productive sectors. 
  The statement was made yesterday by Economy Minister Delmer 
Urbizo Panting a few hours prior to talks with international 
credit organizations, scheduled for today and tomorrow. 
  He added that the international representatives' visits will 
involve preliminary negotiations where they will discuss the 
terms for a negotiation and the possible results, to have an 
overall idea and later notify all the groups. 
  "We must temper agreements reached by the previous 
government 
and the conditions (established with financial organizations) so 
these do not have a violent impact on the Honduran people; if 
they made credits contingent upon something, we will try to 
reverse that," he said. 
  Referring to the increase in some staple product prices, 
Urbizo Panting said that according to figures from the Central 
Bank of Honduras, there was a 3 percent increase in February, 
but it dropped in March, which proves it has been a moderate 
increase. 
  The economy minister said agreements have been reached with 
the private sector concerning price controls, a salary increase, 
and the supply of assets and services. 
  He added that when the economic cabinet begins to discuss 
the 
scope of the measures with international organizations, the 
cabinet will have to first reach an agreement with businessmen 
so that they are fully aware of the situation. 
  The official said the government wants the national 
community 
to be aware of the possible results of the credit organizations' 
plans and the state's position in the talks. 
  He emphasized that joint efforts must be exerted by all 
national groups to face the challenge, not only of international 
organizations but also the challenge resulting from a shortage 
of products.

  [Text] Trinidad, Santa Barbara -- President Roberto Reina 
yesterday said that the potable water and electric energy 
services will not receive a 7 percent tax, as international 
financial organizations have recommended. Reina, who presided 
over the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of this city's 
founding, thus refuted Deputy Finance Minister Ramiro Lozano 
Landa, who had reported that those services would be taxed. 
"Every report should be released positively rather than 
negatively. The country's problem is its economic situation, 
which was not created by this government but handed down from 
the previous one. We are trying to solve it," he said. 
  He pointed out that by the human face he so much referred to 
in his political campaign he meant to avoid, as much as humanly 
possible, imposing too much of a burden on the country's popular 
and lowly classes. "This is the battle I am waging. If you 
journalists do not help me, you will be opposing the Honduran 
history," he said. Nevertheless, he said that, if new taxes have 
to be established, they should be applied on those who are 
economically stronger. "I would regard this as the right 
direction." 
  Regarding a report by Byron Suazo, Liberal Party deputy for 
La Paz Department, saying that the confidential fund had not 
been suspended as Reina had promised in his campaign, but had 
its name changed to humanitarian fund, the president said the 
report is aimed at tarnishing his moral revolution. Reina 
admitted that the presidency incurs in "normal expenditures" but 
that every single cent disbursed is audited. 
  As for the third fuel price increase decreed in three 
months, 
the president said the prices of oil by-products do not depend 
on his administration but on international market prices. "The 
country experiences a difficult situation. If we do not control 
the current inflation, we would enter into an even more 
difficult situation. It is not the government, but inflation, 
which harasses the people. We are trying to solve the problem," 
he said. 
  He said if fuel prices are lowered on the international 
market those prices will automatically be lowered in the country 
by the same percentage. He added that the people should be 
defended by preventing taxes from pressuring them. "This is the 
tragedy that we have been experiencing." 
  Reina said his government is in the process of outlining a 
regulation to protect the country's forests. He remarked that, 
as the result of demand by the majority of the people, he has 
ordered the cutting of trees stopped. He said he took the 
measure because of the way forests are being destroyed. He 
described forests as vital to prevent river basins from drying 
up. If this happens, the country would be left without water. 
He affirmed that he will maintain his position and that he will 
not accept pressure from government officials who own lumber 
mills. 
  Reina also said he never promised to make public the names 
of 
the former officials involved in corruption. He said that he 
had pledged to give the names of the institutions where these 
officials worked and that this is what he did. 
  Regarding the money that the government plans to lend 
peasants for agricultural activities, Reina said that Natural 
Resources Minister Ramon Villeda Bermudez has already reported 
on how the farmers will be aided. 
  [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2051 GMT on 14 May 
reports 
that Deputy Finance Minister Ramiro Lozano had announced that 
the government would tax potable water, telephone, and electric 
energy services. Lozano reportedly had also announced taxes on 
school materials, cable television, and videos, and that these 
taxes were necessary because of World Bank and IMF demands.]

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Armed Forces Chief General Luis 
Alonso Discua Elvir said Friday that the latest actions of 
President Carlos Roberto Reina regarding the Armed Forces are 
correct and, therefore, must not surprise anyone. 
  Gen. Discua attended the inauguration of the first 
industrial 
park of Comayagua. There, he was asked his opinion of the 
Executive Branch's decision to strip the Armed Forces of control 
over Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise] and other 
government institutions, as well as to establish voluntary 
military service. 
  The military chief affirmed that those decisions do not 
create differences between the Executive Branch and the Armed 
Forces. "I think that what is being done is correct," Gen. 
Discua explained. 
  Discua indicated that the agencies that were administered by 
the military had always belonged to the Executive, adding "this 
must not surprise anyone; these are just agencies that come 
under the Executive, and the managers must be appointed by the 
Executive." 
  In the meantime, Discua said he met with President Reina on 
Wednesday afternoon to analyze the problem of the increase of 
crime in the country. He concluded: "We have full support from 
the Executive to face the wave of criminality that has emerged."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 17 
May: 
  Despite the economic recovery achieved by Honduras in 1993, 
there was a considerable drop in the per capita GDP which 
registered 0.3 percent, compared to 2.2 percent in 1992. Also, 
the economic slump caused the per capita income to drop from 1.7 
percent in 1992 to 1.2 percent in 1993. (San Pedro Sula TIEMPO 
in Spanish 10 May 94 p 6) 
  Official statistics indicate that during the first four 
months of 1994, inflation rose in Honduras to 8.42 percent, 
which is twice as much compared to the same period of 1993. 
Also, consumer prices increased by 2.76 percent. The Central 
Bank of Honduras reported that the most significant increases 
were in transportation costs, which increased 7 percent, housing 
4.4 percent, and foodstuffs 3.3 percent. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 1752 GMT 15 May 94) 
  Honduran Government and business officials have rejected a 
report issued by the British magazine THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE 
UNIT which notes that Honduras is a high-risk country for 
investment. According to the magazine, Honduras is on the same 
economic risk level as Nicaragua and Bosnia, among others. 
Adolfo Facusse, president of the Honduran businessmen's 
association, said the problem is that such publications do not 
receive any response from the authorities in their country. He 
admitted, however, that Honduras is experiencing an economic 
crisis that could scare away investors. (Paris AFP in Spanish 
1856 GMT 16 May 94)

  [Text] Managua, 15 May (ACAN-EFE) -- At least 200 
demobilized members of the 3-80 Northern Front (FN-3-80) 
peacefully occupied the municipality of Quilali on 15 May 
protesting the Nicaraguan Government's noncompliance with 
agreements they signed in exchange for giving up the armed 
struggle. 
  Leaders of the extinct FN-3-80 today told journalists in 
Managua that Jose Angel Talavera, alias "Chacal," leader of 
this organization, supported "the occupation of Quilali," which 
began on 14 May. The FN-3-80 blamed National Police "Commander" 
Fernando Caldera for the expulsion of former rebel leaders 
"Pajarito" and "Cascabel" from the police academy due to alleged 
lack of discipline. The former FN-3-80 leaders were being 
trained at the police academy in Managua to occupy police 
positions in the municipalities of northern Nicaragua. 
  Some 600 FN-3-80 members completed their disarmament on 15 
April in exchange for land and credits to purchase properties 
and organize a cooperative for farmers. In addition, the 
government promised to incorporate dozens of demobilized FN-3-80 
members into the police in 13 municipalities in northern 
Nicaragua. 
  The former FN-3-80 leaders blamed "Commander" Caldera for 
the 
current "inactivity" in the implementation of the government 
agreements with the demobilized rebels. There are no reports 
indicating that Army troops patrolling the areas near Quilali 
will move to dislodge the demobilized rebels who have occupied 
this municipality near the Honduran border.

<F P=106> [Report by Edgar Barberena S.] </F>
  [Text] Approximately 90 percent of the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front [FSLN] members active in Managua prior to the 
1990 elections no longer participate in the party's activities. 
This fact, which means only 10 percent of the members are 
active, shows the party is in crisis at all levels. 
  These results are part of a survey conducted by the 
Institute 
of Nicaraguan Studies [IEN]. The survey results are based on 
statistical information from the FSLN's Departmental Directorate 
Committees. Of 17 cities polled, Leon leads with 6,050 active 
members. 
  Although Leon has the most active members, this city also 
shares Sandinists' disappointment over their party. Although 
the membership reportedly had been 10,091, only 59 percent of 
members participated in the pre-Congress discussions. 
  There is a similar case in Chinandega, where only 3,250 
active members, roughly 25 percent, remain from the party's 
former 13,000 members. We wonder what happened to the other 75 
percent of the original membership. Have they defected to other 
parties? Are they disappointed over the current Sandinist 
leaders? Have they joined the ranks of Nicaraguans who no longer 
want to hear anything about political parties? 
<H5>  Congressmen Must Consider </H5>
  These questions should be thoroughly considered by the 
nearly 
600 FSLN delegates who on 20, 21, and 22 May will decide the 
Sandinist Party's future. If we keep making calculations in 
other cities -- like Masaya, where only 42.85 percent of the 
members are active -- we will find that nowhere in Nicaragua is 
100 percent of the membership active. 
  The Sandinists polled by INE say these results are due to 
the 
FSLN rank and file's low morale because of lack of attention and 
the party's internal problems. Those polled pointed out, 
however, that many Sandinists joined the party purely for 
personal reasons. 
  Although some members of the Sandinist directorate have 
denied it, the people polled say this low morale has been proven 
by the the rank and file's low participation in the pre-congress 
assemblies, also called ad hoc meetings. 
  The polled Sandinists said the Sandinists will not win the 
1996 elections if "the FSLN does not succeed in overcoming its 
internal crisis, if democratization is not achieved in the 
party, if the image of marred ethics, morals, and dominance is 
not recovered, and if the party identity and programs are not 
adapted to current circumstances." 
<H5>  Trends in Sandinism </H5>
  The emergence of various trends (orthodox, verticalist 
[verticalista] or Pekin School, or the one that advocates a 
Sandinists' return to the majorities) of necessity was the 
subject of one of the questions addressed in the poll. 
Fifty-four percent think the emergence of these trends is an 
obstacle for the party. The majority, however, think the 
diversity of opinions within Sandinism is positive. 
  Thirty-five percent of those polled believe that trends are 
a 
reality within the FSLN and that these trends help the party. 
Nevertheless, they warned: "The media unsettle the people with 
the reports of those confrontations, by siding with one or the 
other. This creates mistrust, insecurity, and apprehension in 
the rank and file." 
  One of the questions those polled were asked was: Why do you 
think of the struggle of socialists versus and social democrats, 
as well as that of conservatives versus renovators; the struggle 
for power, the competition for leadership, and the normal 
process of diversity in the FSLN? 
  The results were the following: 44 percent think it is a 
mere 
fight for power; 22 percent think it is a normal process of 
diversity in the FSLN; 20 percent think it is a healthy 
competition for leadership; 1 percent think it is a struggle 
between liberals and conservatives; 1 percent said it is a 
struggle between socialists and social democrats; another 1 
percent does not identify with either Daniel Ortega's left or 
Sergio Ramirez' renovating trend. 
<H5>  Other Aspects </H5>
  The survey also includes information on the FSLN's program 
and strategic objectives, which point to the need for reaching 
the rank and file with a permanent work, and streamlining some 
concepts. There is no room for verticalist concepts. It is 
necessary to stimulate the rank and file's active participation 
in the decisionmaking as well as the formulation and 
implementation of party strategy. 
  Although the statistics for Sandinism's renovating trend are 
scant, those polled favored replacing the Sandinist leaders from 
the rank and file up to the chief FSLN leaders. 

<H5>    National Agreement </H5>
  The mentality of the "overwhelming majority" apparently has 
been blotted out of the minds of the Sandinist rank and file 
polled. Approximately 53 percent referred to the need for a 
national agreement in Nicaragua but they ruled out the 
probability of President Violeta Chamorro's government backing 
this idea because, they said, the government must obey the 
international financial organizations. 
<H5>  The Elections' Subject </H5>
  Asked about the 1995 presidential elections, 76 percent say 
the FSLN will be the winner and that, for this reason, a policy 
providing an economic alternative for the people should be 
developed. Nevertheless, they said the methods must be peaceful 
so the workers will not be harmed. 
  Fourteen percent voiced doubts the FSLN will win the 
elections without an internal revision. They think this depends 
on decisions made during the Special Congress, which called for 
the party to do away with its militarist, socialist, and radical 
image, and for the Constitution to be amended. 
  Ten percent think the FSLN will not win the 1996 elections 
if 
the party does not form alliances. This will require work by 
active members. This work must be initiated after the Special 
Congress. In addition, it is necessary to work within the 
framework of an electoral strategy "without burning out 
candidates ahead of time." Those polled added that "it is not a 
matter of buying votes but of gaining the people's confidence in 
the daily struggle." 
<H5>  And the Alliances, With Whom? </H5>
  The intensive political indoctrination the Sandinists were 
subjected to during the past decade became evident in a study 
because one sector said no other party exists with a political 
viewpoint similar to the Sandinist Party's. Those polled 
recalled the poor precedents set by other alliances throughout 
history. 
  Others suggested the possibility of the Sandinist Party 
establishing electoral alliances with the Christian Democratic 
Union [UDC], the Party of the Nicaraguan Resistance [PRN], and 
moderate parties, such as PUCA [Central American Unionist Party] 
and other centralist organizations. 
  The opinion poll included questions regarding the amendments 
the Constitution will undergo at the National Assembly. 
Fifty-eight percent think no one should be banned from running 
for president in 1996; 38 percent favor leaving open the option 
for re-election, and 4 percent think this reelection should be 
staggered, as outlined in the reform proposal drafted by seven 
Assembly factions.

  [Text] This morning a ceremony installing the government 
transition team was held. The team is formed by representatives 
of President Guillermo Endara and President-elect Ernesto Perez 
Balladares. The so-called transition team is composed of the 
following people: 
  Representing President Endara: Eduardo Linares, deputy 
minister of planning and economy policy; and Joaquin Franco, 
vice president of the Authentic Liberal Party. 
  The president-elect's representatives are Francisco Sanchez 
Cardenas and Jose Luis Sosa. 
  At the installation ceremony, Ernesto Perez Balladares 
praised the demonstrated goodwill as well as the work done in 
recent days by President Endara and his government to make an 
exemplary and democratic transition possible. 
  [Begin Perez Balladares recording] The next few months will 
be months of coordination and transition and will attest to our 
respect and determination that Guillermo Endara continue as 
president of the country until 1 September 1994, until an hour 
yet to be established. We hope that in the spirit of cooperation 
we may do whatever is feasible and possible to see that the 
transition is carried out in the least disruptive way possible, 
with the utmost respect for all the people of the Endara 
administration and all public officials involved in this 
transition, who I am sure understand that their jobs are not at 
stake. [end recording] 
  Presdent Endara expressed his satisfaction with the normalcy 
that prevailed during the 1994 elections. 
  [Begin Endara recording] It is a fact that the outgoing 
president wants the president-elect and his team to be prepared 
to assume the government on 1 September by knowing whatever they 
want to know. We will gladly oblige. [end recording] 
  From now on, the government's transition commission, which 
began work immediately, will have to prepare full reports for 
the members of the new government that will be sworn in on 1 
September.

newscast] 
  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares has 
appointed Nitzia de Villarreal commerce and industries minister, 
a post she accepted this afternoon and which she will occupy as 
of 1 September. 
  Boris Moreno, secretary to the president-elect, announced 
the 
decision and said that Villarreal is a founding member of the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] who served the Commerce and 
Industries Ministry for over 12 years. She also worked in the 
hydrocarbons directorate with much professionalism. 
  [Begin recording] [Villarreal] Of course I will dedicate all 
my professional efforts, capability, and energy in my post for 
the benefit of the country. The Commerce and Industries 
Ministry is one of the engines of economic development. I think 
the task is difficult, but I feel capable of accomplishing it. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is your goal for your future 
position? 
  [Villarreal] Again, I believe the most important thing is to 
hold consultations among parties. With the support of the 
industrial and commercial sectors, we can do a good job. The 
doors to my office will be open to anyone who approaches, 
especially investors, so this country can progress the way we 
want it to. [end recording] 
  Nitzia de Villarreal is a petroleum engineer and has a 
master's degree in industrial management. She played a key role 
in negotiating the purchase of oil from Mexico and in planning a 
national hydrocarbons policy. 
  The president-elect's secretary also confirmed that only two 
cabinet posts have been officially announced. 
  [Begin Moreno recording] Mr. Gabriel Lewis Galindo has been 
confirmed [as foreign minister] by the president of the 
Republic, as has the minister of commerce and industries. So 
far these are the only posts the president has announced 
officially. I would say that all of the posts will be announced 
in the next 24 to 48 hours. [end recording]

  [Text] Dr. Jorge Illueca will be Panama's ambassador to the 
United Nations during the Perez Balladares administration. 
Press spokesman Mario Velasquez told RPC that former President 
Jorge Illueca accepted Dr. Perez Balladares' offer to occupy the 
Panamanian post at the United Nations. 
  In addition, Carlos Sousa Lennox, executive secretary of 
Anagan [National Association of Cattlemen), announced his 
decision to accept the post of agriculture development minister 
in Perez Balladares' administration. Sousa Lennox reached his 
decision after resigning from the Arnulfist Party before the 
Electoral Tribunal. 
  [Begin Sousa Lennox recording] In view of the request that 
we 
serve the country and in light of the clamor of Panamanian 
agricultural-livestock producers for this ministry to be in the 
hands of a producer and a professional in the sector, I have 
decided to accept the post of agriculture development minister 
offered to me by President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares. I am 
sure I will receive total support and cooperation from 
President-elect Perez Balladares and from the producers so I can 
carry out my tasks as minister of the agricultural-livestock 
sector to achieve the hopes and objectives they have expressed 
to me. [end recording] 
  Sousa Lennox said he was satisfied with the support from 
various representatives of the agricultural-livestock sector and 
from professional organizations. He also announced his 
commitment, and that of all those officials who will accompany 
him in his office, to see that all institutions will truly be at 
the service of the man in the countryside. 
  [Begin Sousa Lennox recording] We will draft a national plan 
for the agricultural-livestock sector to establish the economic 
and social policies, the fundamental purpose of which will be to 
chart the course for all agriculture-livestock producers. 
Short-term economic changes are made by both positive and 
negative forces. That is why we must have programs that will 
allow us to carry out the agricultural-livestock policies. [end 
recording].

<F P=106> [Report by Alvarez Cedeno and Jose Quintero De Leon] </F>
  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares has now officially 
appointed five of his 12 new cabinet ministers. The last 
appointment is Nitizia de Villarreal to the Commerce and 
Industry Ministry [MICI], sources of the new government reported. 
  Perez Balladares' spokespersons reported yesterday the 
appointment of Villarreal, a hydrocarbon engineer with 12 years 
of experience in the MICI. During a news conference, Villarreal 
said: "We will work hard to advance the nation, and we will work 
under an open-door policy at the MICI." 
  Besides Villarreal, the other official appointments are: 
Gabriel Lewis Galindo as foreign minister, Mitchel Doens as 
labor minister; Luis Blanco as public works minister, and 
Olmendo Miranda as treasury minister. 
  It was unofficially reported that Carlos Sousa Lennox has 
accepted the offer to direct the MIDA [Agricultural Development

possible planning minister. The other appointments are pending 
until they are officially disclosed by the president-elect, it

  Hugo Torrijos, nephew of General Omar Torrijos, has been 
appointed National Port Authority director. The president-elect

  Sousa Lennox, president of the National Association of 
Cattlemen, announced to the press that he has officially 
accepted president-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares' offer to be 
MIDA minister. Nevertheless, he did make it clear that he had 
resigned from the Arnulfist Party. Sousa Lennox noted at the 
news conference that he had accepted the offer "in light of the 
invitation to serve the nation and because of the appeal from 
the agricultural producers." He noted that he is convinced that 
the ministry should be led by a producer and professional of 
that sector. Sousa Lennox said: "I resign from the Arnulfist 
Party, convinced that the nation's interests come before party 
interests," adding that he had presented his resignation to the 
Electoral Tribunal.

<F P=106> [Report by Fernando Fernandez from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Solidarity Party today agreed to support the 
proposed national consensus promoted by President-elect Ernesto 
Perez Balladares. Perez Balladares on Monday attended a news 
conference held by Solidarity Party members and headed by party 
president Samuel Lewis Galindo during which the party publicly 
announced its decision to support the proposed national 
consensus in view of the wise steps being taken by Dr. Perez 
Balladares. 
  [Begin recording] [Lewis] We met with the party board of 
directors and with our candidates -- pardon me -- with our 
legislators and agreed to support Dr. Perez Balladares' endeavor 
to form a government that represents the entire nation. We are 
offering him this political support today, and we hope he can 
complete his cabinet in a way that he will achieve what the 
Panamanians want. Panamanians want unity. They want to leave 
behind rancor, hate, and revenge and realize that this country 
belongs to everyone. Only by working together can we meet the 
challenges of the future. Therefore, Dr. Perez Balladares, I am 
very pleased to offer you our support. 
  [Perez Balladares] Thank you very much. [end recording] 
  For his part, Dr. Perez Balladares said the Solidarity 
Party's decision exemplifies the country's political forces 
because they are joining a nonpartisan effort that is nationally 
oriented, striving to achieve in the next five years all the 
national objectives shared by Panamanians. 
  [Begin Perez Balladares recording] For us it obviously 
signifies extraordinary support to have this support -- pardon 
the redundancy -- from the Solidarity Party because it also 
means we will have a majority in the Legislative Assembly. With 
that legislative majority, without denying the participation of 
other forces that will also have their views, we can enact many 
of the laws needed to spell out this new relationship for 
progress, peace, cooperation, and unity among all Panamanians. 
It is a significant step by the Solidarity Party. We applaud 
it and hope it serves as an example for other political parties 
so we can join forces for the sake of the fatherland, and for 
the good of the humble and the poverty-stricken. From now until 
1999, we are under the same tent, which is the fatherland. [end

  The president-elect then met privately with Gabriel Lewis 
Galindo, future foreign minister, and with Apostolic Nuncio 
Osvaldo Padilla. Afterward, in the office of Magistrate 
President Eduardo Valdes Escoffery, Dr. Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, Tomas Altamirano Duque, and Felipe Virzi, the 
president and first and second vice presidents, respectively, 
received their credentials as members of the United People 
alliance slate which won the elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Human Development Minister Enrique Ipina; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [PRESENCIA] Will there be changes in the 
secretariats of the Ministry of Human Development (MDH) because 
of the cabinet crisis? 
  [Ipina] The new arrangement does not affect the Law of 
Ministries structure, which clearly defines the responsibilities 
of the MDH. These responsibilities--which are substantive and 
are not to be considered incidental--must be carried out by 
well-defined executive organs, and the system of secretariats 
that we now have in the Ministry fulfills these 
responsibilities. Therefore, they will all remain. 
  [PRESENCIA] But Popular Participation, which had been slated 
for the MDH, has been passed to the Ministry of Sustainable 
Development.... 
  [Ipina] Popular Participation is unique. It is not an 
exclusive function of this ministry, although it is substantive. 
In fact, it covers all of the state's powers. 
  What in fact was formed was a Technical Unit of Popular 
Participation (UTPP)--not a secretariat--and a team was 
organized that prepared the Popular Participation plan, directed 
by Minister Fernando Romero and supported by the national 
secretaries. 
  The plan was the subject of a lengthy discussion. It had 
more 
than 35 versions, because the president himself took an interest 
and personally took charge of directing the discussions in a way 
that could be described as merciless: indecisiveness, vagueness, 
and improvisation were not tolerated. 
  [PRESENCIA] Will this unit be passed to the Ministry of 
Sustainable Development? 
  [Ipina] The president is studying that possibility. The UTPP 
can fit in the MDH as well as in the Ministry of Sustainable 
Development. 
  I personally believe that it would be better off in 
Sustainable Development for one simple reason: I am convinced 
that Popular Participation is something that should be above any 
suspicion of partisan manipulation, because it reflects the 
highest and most substantive policy of the state: the 
development of democracy. 
  In that sense, the UTPP can carry out its responsibilities 
with a better public guarantee of party neutrality if it is 
headed by an independent minister and not by a supporter of the 
government, which is my situation. 
  With Minister Guillermo Justiniano--a man of proven ability 
and honesty, of great commitment to the country--Popular 
Participation will have an additional guarantee, visible and 
palpable--if the statements by the Executive Power were not 
already sufficient--of the government's intention, decision, and 
determination that this matter be managed above the interests of 
the parties. 
  [PRESENCIA] What are the general guidelines that you will 
establish in the MDH? 
  [Ipina] I am convinced that the standard of living in our 
country cannot be considered suitable for human dignity. We are 
a country that is deeply divided into two worlds. One rural, 
tremendously impoverished by an urban world that feels insecure, 
but that bases its welfare on the exploitation or 
hyperexploitation of the rural world. 
  We have a typical case, for example, in agricultural prices 
which, because of the way they are established, pay the smallest 
benefit to the peasant. 
  Thererefore, the policy of human development must 
concentrate 
precisely on trying to overcome this kind of hyperexploitation 
of the countryside by the city, which is also evident in that 
the relatively high quality of basic urban services is made 
possible only because of the almost total lack of such services 
in rural areas. We have to lean toward establishing a system of 
equity in the basic social services and support everything that 
implies the humane attention of society. 
  Our greatest concern must be to provide water, sewers, 
power, 
health, education, enjoyment of and participation in cultural 
activities, sports, welfare services for abandoned children and 
for the aged, where such services do not exist or are very 
scarce, while not forgetting that there are also enormous and 
complex needs in urban areas, especially in outlying zones, 
where we are witnessing a dramatic phenomenon. 
  In that sense, our concern for rural areas should not stop 
at 
the limits of the urban peripheral world. It should enter it, 
and this explains the president's determination that there be 
integrated treatment, rural and urban, of social problems. Both 
have become so merged with one another that the welfare of one 
is closely connected to that of the other, and overcoming the 
lack of development would be impossible without taking this into 
account. 
  This justifies and explains the Popular Participation Law, 
that creates the urban-rural municipality, territorialized, 
which transcends the old colonial concept of the urban area and 
which gives it the right to concern itself as much with the 
province as with the classic city. 
  [PRESENCIA] Why is there so much opposition from city halls 
and civic committees to the Participation Law? 
  [Ipina] Actually, the opposition is not so great, because, 
in 
an institutionally democratic country, no one can be against 
popular participation. There has been a kind of fear and 
nervousness over losing special treatment that the urban world 
has enjoyed. 
  Taking into account that 83 percent of the nation's income 
is 
concentrated in just three large cities, we can imagine the 
state of abandonment of the rural areas, not only of the 
provinces, but of the smaller cities, even the capitals of 
departments. 
  Observing this phenomenon and assigning an equitable 
distribution of the national income to the municipalities, based 
on the number of inhabitants, those who are privileged--the 
large cities--obviously are afraid of losing out. And as their 
problems are also not resolved, their opposition or contained 
resistance explained why the attitude of the municipalities has 
been and continues to be very prudent. 
  [PRESENCIA] But the government has had to accept the fact 
that Congress is considering the proposed Administrative 
Decentralization Law at the same time as the Popular 
Participation Law.... 
  [Ipina] In my opinion, administrative decentralization, as 
it 
is being put forward, was more in response to the interests of 
the large cities. That is why there has been some resistance. 
  What we are doing now is showing how decentralization at the 
departmental level does not conflict with popular participation, 
with the allocation of resources to the basic territorial 
organizations, to the provinces, and to the small towns. 
  [PRESENCIA] The health, education, sports, and cultural 
areas 
are defined. But the others are not: Provincial and Rural 
Development; Ethnic, Gender, and Generational Affairs; and 
Social Investment, which includes the funds. How do you intend 
to orient them? 
  [Ipina] Good planning for activities of the state begins 
with 
an analysis of basic social needs. The Plan for Everyone saw 
this clearly: an extremely impoverished rural area, a great need 
for social services and therefore low productivity by Bolivians. 
  We saw clearly that we needed to promote and improve rural 
and peasant life in Bolivia. Therefore, an objective was 
assigned to a perceived need: to energize that neglected area of 
national life. And the assignment of an objective calls for the 
creation of an instrument: the National Secretariat of Rural 
Development. 
  The same holds true for the National Secretariat of Ethnic, 
Gender, and Generational Affairs. There are obvious inequalities 
in our country. The most serious of all is ethnic inequality. 
The evidence is clear. The great majority of adults who do not 
know how to read are indigenous. It is evident that there is 
ethnic inequality, and if we analyze further, we find that three 
of four who do not know how to read are women. There is evident 
inequality by sex difference--as we used to say--or by 
gender--as we now say. 
  In the world of labor, of education, health, culture, 
sports, 
woman shines by her absence. With very rare exceptions, this 
continues to be a country made by men for men, through women who 
work for them. This cannot continue. The same is true of youth, 
childhood, and old age. 
  Thus, the Secretariat answers this need, not with welfare 
(which is the responsibility of ONAMFA [expansion not given]), 
but with a program for improvement, which is different and which 
is the responsibility of the Secretariat. 
  In the case of the Urban Secretariat for Urban Development, 
we used to have a Ministry for Urban Affairs and Housing, whose 
functions duplicated those of the autonomous municipalities. It 
was understandable that there be such a ministry when 
municipalities were not autonomous and mayors were handpicked. 
But it no longer made any sense once the municipalities were 
democratized. However, there is a need for a Secretariat charged 
with improving the municipalities, of strengthening them in view 
of the need to extend the system to the entire country and not 
just to a few cities, and of organizing the entire country into 
municipalities. That is its function. 
  It might seem, then, that the three Secretariats are not 
well 
defined, but they are, and although the quality of their 
services might not yet be appreciated, people will realize how 
important they are as they carry out their work. 
  [PRESENCIA] One sees in your explanation a logical sequence 
of the idea of human development. But when it comes to putting 
it into practise, the General Budget retains the traditional 
tendency to prioritize economics and politics. Why is it 
impossible to change that relationship? 
  [Ipina] I believe that, while there is a change in general 
direction that can be seen in a kind of 50-50 division between 
economic and social factors (another question is the political 
sector, which also takes its slice: the Ministries of Defense 
and Government, because of the problems we face in the fight 
against drug trafficking, etc.), it seems to remain static 
because the pie continues to be small. 
  We have inherited a pie, furthermore, that is inflated by a 
6.5 percent budget deficit. But we could not continue on with 
that policy, as it would have caused the loss of one of our 
country's great achievements in recent years, macroeconomic 
stability. 
  But when the pie grows, which we hope will happen as a 
result 
of capitalization, there will be no reason for the economic and 
political sectors to grow significantly, and the social sector 
will be the only one able to grow. 
  This means that if we now have 100, which is divided in 
40-40-20, when we have 200, the new relationship will be 
20-10-70. This is why the pie has to grow. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  Educational Reform in a few words </H5>
  [PRESENCIA] What are the principal features of Educational 
Reform? 
  [Ipina] There are two central pillars: popular participation 
and interculturalism. 
  The first refers to democratization of the administration of 
education, to the very institutionality of the system, which is 
to open it to the participation of the community, which must 
have the possiblity of assisting in educational tasks and in 
administration. 
  The second pillar is pedagogical in nature and has its major 
philosophical orientation in interculturalism, which is the soul 
of Reform. This a novel view of an old reality: the 
multipluralism of races, cultures, and regions in the country, 
which we regard as a comparative advantage, like a natural 
resource, like a group of positive factors that make us better 
people and, some day, better off economically. 
  [PRESENCIA] Specifically, how will the education system be 
organized? 
  [Ipina] The reform proposal's philosophy is evident, first, 
in the opening of the curriculum to regionalization, on the 
basis of common national roots, so that it not only answers 
national needs, but also regional and local ones as well. 
  Second, bilingualism where it is necessary so that children 
learn to write in their mother tongue and acquire Castilian as a 
second language. 
  The curriculum is divided into four levels: initial, 
primary, 
secondary and superior, which is the usual arrangement. The 
interesting part is to see what happens within each of them. 
  The nonformal part of the initial level will be entrusted to 
the family and the community; the school will only occupy a 
year, in order to be able to extend the service to all children. 
At present, we are only teaching 30 percent of the children for 
two years; we hope to reach 60 percent soon, for a single year. 
  At six years of age, the child enters the primary level. 
There are no longer any grades, to avoid truancy and being left 
back. This phase is conceived as a single level organized by 
blocks of objectives that have to be achieved by all pupils, 
according to their personal rhythm, so that groups move ahead, 
respecting their personal rhythms. 
  If a child fulfills the objectives of one block, he or she 
passes on to the next. There is no first or second grade, etc., 
but rather basic, essential, and applied apprenticeships. An 
entire cycle should last eight years at most, but a high 
percentage of children can do it in six years, and some even in 
five. The slowest will finish in eight. No child should lose a 
year or be left back. Therefore, no child should have any reason 
to leave school. We want to broaden coverage and retain the 
child in school for at least eight years of primary school. 
  This assumes that the curriculum will contain an 
intercultural focus, because regional and cultural diversities, 
and individual differences, will be respected. 
  At the secondary level, there will be a common two-year 
period of technical education for everyone, not forgetting 
language and mathematics. Then it branches out: two years of 
technical education at midlevel and two years of preparation for 
university undergraduate education. 
  In this way as well we will be responding to local and 
regional planning needs, because these technical proposals will 
be drawn up in each department. 
  Finally, at the superior level: higher technical and 
standard 
university courses towards the baccalaureate and doctoral 
degrees. 
  This curriculum follows faithfully the doctrinal 
philosophical focus of interculturalism, the soul of the reform. 
  In sum, Education Reform can be synthesized in two great 
concepts: popular participation and interculturalism. 
  [PRESENCIA] How long will the process of change take? 
  [Ipina] Something that assumes gradual growth cannot be 
implanted overnight. Curriculum changes will begin in 1995, 
gradually and progressively. But the institutional changes, 
those regarding popular participation, have to be fully achieved 
by 1997. 
  The Technical Support Team for Education (ETARE) has 
established a 20-year period as being necessary to appreciate 
the magnitude of the results, but these results will be evident 
objectively and concretely each year in the way that these 
activities are carried out. 
  [PRESENCIA] Attention will be centered on the primary cycle? 
  [Ipina] Yes, but the others will also benefit, through 
improvement of education. Curriculum reform has two elements: 
change and improvement. The first will be applied radically with 
those programs that are just beginning; the second, with those 
that are already operating. 
  [PRESENCIA] You have just returned from the United States 
where you obtained assistance for education reform. With whom 
did you meet and what specific agreements did you bring back? 
  [Ipina] Together with the negotiating team, I met with the 
World Bank (IBRD), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and 
representatives of the friendly donor countries, who are making 
substantial contributions to the process of educational reform. 
  We completed the technical discussions and began the formal 
negotiating process, which ended in the approval of the terms of 
the loan agreement, which must be discussed at senior levels of 
the IBRD and the IDB, as well as at high levels of the Bolivian 
state, specifically, in the legislature. 
  When all these agencies have approved the terms, the donor 
countries will also contribute, and disbursements will begin 
according to the schedules that support the various programs 
provided for. 
  [PRESENCIA] Is the IBRD's pressure over content and form 
real, or is this a myth? 
  [Ipina] I would say at present they are a myth. The IBRD 
obviously has experience with educational reform in the various 
countries that it has financed and when it begins to talk to the 
Bolivian Government, it makes certain proposals. For its part, 
the government sits at the same table and explains what it wants 
to do. 
  In this way, a period of technical discussions begins, in 
which each side presents its point of view. But there is no 
pressure. The proof is that we were practically able to, I will 
not say impose, but rather define our position with total 
clarity, and the IBRD accepted our terms. 
  The IBRD's position on certain points also helped us. For 
example, its concern for the self-sustaining nature of the 
reform in future years, which assumes the existence of a scheme 
of macroeconomic projections. It was a requirement of the IBRD, 
and we had to work very hard on it. Antonio Sagasta prepared a 
study that both the government and the bank found very 
satisfactory. If the IBRD had not set that condition, we 
probably would not have done it. 
  [PRESENCIA] Is it true that the IBRD requires a high degree 
of consensus with the teachers? 
  [Ipina] Of course. Not only the IBRD but also the donor 
countries and the IDB, who are also interested in the continuity 
of the process. 
  One of the nicest things has been that for the first time a 
bank like the IBRD has agreed to finance a project that is not 
totally defined from the start, but that is conceived as a 
project subject to modification as it evolves, something that it 
has never accepted before. 
  [PRESENCIA] Who are the donor countries? 
  [Ipina] The Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden are the three. 
Other countries might join in as the project develops. They were 
undoubtedly waiting for the results of the negotiations with the 
IBRD. 
  [PRESENCIA] How much money is involved? 
  [Ipina] Approximately $140 million. The IBRD will authorize 
$42-45 million, the IDB $55 million, and the donor countries, 
all together, $40 million. 
  To this must be added the national contribution, set at $36 
million, which brings us to $176-180 million, which is the 
financing for the start-up of educational reform, in its first 
seven-year stage, destined basically to primary education in the 
transformation stage and to secondary education in the 
improvement stage. 
  After those seven years, we will enter into the preparation 
and development of the transformation of secondary education. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  "We Want Opposition" </H5>
  Suddenly, Enrique Ipina is asked about a fear that has 
arisen: the danger that there might be a tendency toward 
hegemony on the part of the government coalition and especially 
of the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] in the formation 
of the basic territorial organizations, provided for in the 
Popular Participation Law. 
  Ipina speaking frankly says that "if we were a one-party 
government, we could talk about a desire for hegemony, but we 
are not. We are well aware that, even if we did win 36-38 
percent of the national vote, this is only a plurality, and we 
have formed a coalition government with three other parties that 
are very important. One of them, the UCS [expansion not 
available], because of the number of votes it won; the other 
two, for the quality of their political activity and of their 
ideas. The MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] is a great party, beyond 
its voting strength, and the same can be said of the MRTKL 
[Tupac Katari Revolutionary Movement of Liberation] to a 
somewhat lesser degree." 
  He added that, because of "the way in which the work in the 
Executive Branch and the Congress is being organized, one cannot 
really speak of a movement toward hegemony in the heart of the 
coalition. When decisions are taken, one opinion weighs as much 
as another, and it is not a question of how many votes one has , 
but of how right one is." 
  Outside the coalition, Ipina insists that "no tendency 
toward 
hegemony exists there, either. On the contrary, we are very 
concerned over the lack of a political opposition, due to the 
problems that are affecting the MIR [Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left] and the ADN [Nationalist Democratic Action], 
because when the opposition no longer expresses itself 
politically, it begins to express itself by other means." 
  This is becoming serious because, in his opinion, "it does 
us 
no good either that the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] itself 
is suffering deterioration because of a lack of vision by its 
leaders and a failure to adapt to changing times." 
  So that "in the absence of opposition parties and of a 
creative labor organization, with whom could one discuss 
problems that affect civil society? A political monologue could 
easily develop, which is not hegemony, it is poverty, political 
pauperization." 
  Ipina believes for these reasons that the government "would 
like to have an organized opposition, find a leader with whom to 
talk. The same is true of the labor movement."

  [Editorial Report] At their conference in Cochabamba on 15 
April, Bolivia's bishops issued a document highlighting current 
socioeconomic and political crises affecting the nation. The 
message got favorable reactions from Vice President Hugo 
Cardenas, Congress, labor leaders, and the major dailies. 
  The La Paz daily HOY of 16 April reported that the Bolivian 
Bishops Conference (CEB) document entitled "Dignity and Hope" 
acknowledged the people's concerns over "current events which 
have convulsed the country"; their fears and uncertainties over 
the proposed laws comprising the government's reform package; 
the worsening poverty experienced by most Bolivians; the growing 
controversy over Law 1008: the Law of Special Regulations on 
Coca and Controlled Substances--which the bishops declared "must 
be reviewed and revised." The document referred to U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration intervention in the MIR-narco scandal 
as events that have "belittled the dignity of the nation" and 
"submitted its sovereignty to foreign interests." 
  The document, according to La Paz PRESENCIA 16 April, also 
decried corruption, which it said "has been institutionalized at 
various levels of the state administration and has endangered 
the credibility of broad sectors of the political elite." The 
bishops contended that these problems have been aggravated in 
recent days by "repeated conflicts between the government and 
the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB), students, peasants, miners, 
and teachers, creating anxiety and instability in the country." 
The daily reported that the bishops urged compromise and 
dialogue and called for spiritual "disarmament" when facing this 
conflict. 
  The same daily added that the bishops, on the other hand, 
applauded the many "signs of hope" in the country such as "new 
efforts toward modernization and educational reform"; the 
"tenacity" with which corruption cases in public administration 
have been uncovered; and the growing struggle of the people for 
their rights which "have often been forgotten or even crushed." 
  Vice President Hugo Cardenas told the 17 April PRESENCIA 
that 
he had urged Congress to "seriously consider" the Church's view 
on the need to revise Law 1008. He praised the bishops' 
awareness of the "real nature of Law 1008" and their initiative 
in pointing out its defects, one of which is that the penalties 
for contravening the law are not proportionate to the crimes. 
According to HOY of 18 April, the law denies people freedom of 
movement and communication, parole, or release on bail. 
"Therefore, human rights and constitutional precepts are 
violated," explained Deputy Ramiro Barrenechea, member of the 
Chamber of Deputies Narcotics Commission. 
  Juan Carlos Duran, president of the Senate and top leader of 
the ruling Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), referred to 
the bishops' document as "very timely" in the 18 April 
PRESENCIA DEL PAIS. He explained that, as a result, the 
government has proposed that the law be revised by the national 
Congress following the installation of the next legislature in 
August. The announcement was made 19 April by President Sanchez 
de Lozada in a press conference, according to the 22 April 
Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS. 
  HOY of 17 April praised the "spontaneous communion of views" 
between labor leaders and the Bolivian Catholic Church in the 
face of "U.S. interference in internal affairs and the social 
conflicts that are plaguing the country." Concerning the 
bishops' statement on government corruption, Oscar Salas, 
executive secretary of the COB, commented that "each and every 
one of the country's political groups has a shameful previous 
history." "Coupists, fugitives, and corrupt politicians involved 
in drug trafficking unfortunately abound in the national 
Congress," charged the leader of the teachers union of La Paz, 
Jose Luis Alvarez, "and that is one of the principal reasons 
that the politicians and the system are continuing to lose 
credibility." Commenting on Law 1008, HOY noted that labor 
leaders agreed with the Church about the need for revision of 
the law and for the "very same reasons." 
  Ernesto Machicao, Minister of Social Communication, told 17 
April HOY that the Catholic Church's pronouncements on various 
aspects of national reality are always looked upon with respect 
by the government and, thus, will be carefully studied. He told 
PRESENCIA of 18 April that after consulting with President 
Sanchez de Lozada and other ministers, the government decided to 
"follow" the exhortations in the bishops' message and try to 
solve the ongoing labor conflict with "dialogue and compromise." 
Machicao, nevertheless, characterized as "unjust" the bishops' 
accusations that the government is responsible for the 
"increasing poverty experienced by the majority of Bolivians," 
and stressed the administration's efforts to pass its four-part 
reform package in just eight months in office. 
  Finally, an editorial in 17 April HOY urged people to 
"meditate on the way shown us by the Catholic Church," which 
continues to be a "permanent institution in our country."

  [Excerpt] Brasilia, 16 May (EFE) -- After approving a 
number of recent amendments, the Brazilian Senate today ratified 
the Tlatelolco Treaty, which proscribes the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry stated that with the 
ratification of the treaty and its amendments Brazil has 
completed a revision of its international nuclear policy, thus 
demonstrating its commitment to the nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons. 
  The Tlatelolco Treaty, which was signed in Mexico City on 14 
February 1967, was designed to make Latin America the first 
region in the world to be free of nuclear weapons and to stop 
the arms race in the region. 
  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry added that the treaty's 
ratification "clearly demonstrates the high significance the 
country attaches to the treaty, which provides that all 
signatories are equals and have the same rights and obligations 
and requires safeguards from militarily armed countries."

<F P=106> [Article: "Candidates Launch Programs in May"] </F>
  [Text] The difficult and drawn-out process of forming 
electoral alliances, which is to be interrupted in May and then 
resumed after the first round of balloting on 3 October, is 
concealing something new from the voters: practically all the 
candidates will arrive at their party conventions in May with 
plans for government in their briefcases and maybe even on the 
tips of their tongues. What they are all proposing is economic 
growth and a fight against poverty. 
  It is true that some situations are not very clear. The PT 
[Workers Party], for example, has a plan for government, but so 
far its candidate, Lula, does not. Strong resistance to some 
aspects of the plan have made it necessary to harmonize what the 
majority in the party says with what the candidate can 
reasonably propose to the country. The PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party] has a party platform that was drawn up in July 
1993, but Fernando Henrique's plan for government will have to 
be the result of the negotiations, already under way, with the 
PFL [Liberal Front Party], his main electoral partner.

*The final form of the programs will depend on party alliances. 


  The PDT [Democratic Labor Party] drew up a platform at its 
third national congress--held three years ago--and is scheduled 
to complete its revision of that platform this week. The 
resulting document will become the guide for candidates in the 
states and for the rank and file. To some extent, it is also 
supposed to guide Brizola's campaign message, since he is once 
again the party's candidate for president of the republic. 
  In the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], two of 
the 
men running for nomination on 15 May--Jose Sarney and Orestes 
Quercia--have plans for government and a few programs outlined. 
The new candidate for the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], 
Senator Esperidiao Amin, also knows by now what he is going to 
propose to the voters. The table above shows how each 
candidate's party proposes to deal with 11 points in the plans 
for government.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Federal Supreme Court (STF) has 
approved modifications to the electoral law and has thus opened 
up space in the electoral competition for nine small parties. 
These modifications could cause changes in a political scenario 
that had been practically defined. The Social Christian Party 
[PSC], for example, is already considering the possibility of 
talking to Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB-AP) [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party--Amapa] if the STF also modifies the term for 
party registration. 
  PSC President Vitor Nosseis said Senator Sarney would be 
welcome to the party if he decides to leave the PMDB to run in 
the elections. 
  Even if Senator Sarney does not accept the PSC invitation, 
the party will have a presidential candidate, chosen between 
Brigadier Ivan Frota and Admiral Ernani Goulart Fortuna, former 
War College commander. 
  Prona [Party for Redefinition of National Order] will also 
have a candidate: Eneas Ferreira Carneiro, who is ready to enter 
the electoral campaign with the same slogan he used during 1989: 
"My name is Eneas." At that time, he had only 15 seconds of free 
electoral propaganda time. Now he will have at least one minute, 
and he plans to make use of the space reserved for Prona's 18 
gubernatorial candidates. 
  Eneas asserts that if he could have two or three minutes, he 
would run over his rivals like a tractor. 
  Among the other small parties, some still think about having 
their own candidates. Most of them, however, are committed to 
alliances with the large parties. The PMN [National Mobilization 
Party], which ran in the last elections with Celso Brandt as 
candidate, is holding talks with the PDT [Democratic Labor 
Party]. The PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil], the PPS 
[People's Socialist Party], and the PSTU [Unified Social Workers 
Party] joined the PT [Workers Party] in supporting Lula's 
candidacy. The PV [Green Party] is still holding talks with the 
PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], the PT, and the PDT. 
All the small parties will have free electoral propaganda time 
on television, and the TSE [Superior Electoral Court] will have 
to redistribute the free electoral propaganda time among 20 
parties.

  [Text] Curitiba -- In the wake of his defeat at the PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] primaries, former Parana 
Governor Roberto Requiao yesterday announced that he will 
endorse Workers Party [PT] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. 
Requiao said he is convinced Lula will win the elections in the 
first round. Requiao conceded defeat to Quercia yesterday 
morning in a speech he delivered before PMDB delegates at the 
Legislative Assembly in Curitiba. 
  Requiao said: Lula will win because the other parties are 
increasingly demoralized. At the PMDB convention, we run the 
risk of internally promoting the rehabilitation of Deputies 
Genabaldo Correa, Ibsen Pinheiro, and Manuel Moreira, who were 
charged by the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating 
Committee]. 
  Without directly attacking Quercia, Requiao reaffirmed that 
he will not participate in the PMDB campaign. 
  Requiao said: I said I would do without with Quercia's 
support for my candidacy and I hope he will do the same. I 
support Lula. No one can prevent me from seeking a Senate seat. 
  Requiao made it clear that he will not hold the PMDB rank 
and 
file responsible for the outcome of the elections. 
  Requiao said: PMDB members cannot be held responsible; that 
lies with the slow, weak leaders who adopted an ostrich-like 
policy in Congress by sticking their heads in the sand. He 
stated that he will continue within the PMDB.

  [Text] Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero has ruled out the 
possibility of the government converting the real in dollars or 
in other currencies. He declined, however, to make comments on 
the exchange rate. 
  The minister said savings accounts will not be modified, and 
that they will continue to be adjusted by the TR [Reference 
Interest Rate]. He did not identify, however, the factors that 
will be taken into account for calculating the TR. 
  Ricupero announced that this week he will set the rules for 
conversion of school monthly fees into real value units.

  [Text] Two important investment banks--one Brazilian and 
one American--have decided to immediately withdraw their 
investments from the Brazilian financial market. 
  One of these banks has a $1 billion portfolio of 
investments, 
of which $700 million comes from abroad. 
  The decision follows a combination of two factors: The lead 
in the polls by PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva and his statements during his meetings with bankers and 
investors in the United States. 
  The comments by Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (PT-SP) [Sao 
Paulo], who is considered to be one of the mentors of the PT 
economic policy, confirm investors' perception that Lula will 
head for a closed, government-controlled, economy with 
restrictions on foreign capital. 
  The decision to begin withdrawing money now from the country 
is strategic. Investors believed they would not have to worry 
about the subject until September, just before the first voting 
round of the presidential elections (3 October). They initially 
planned to withdraw the money between the first and second 
voting round. 
  The banks decided to move now given Lula's lead among voter 
preference. A good portion of foreign investments is applied in 
the stock exchange. 
  If investors decide to sell en masse there will be big 
losses 
because prices will drop considerably. 
  Those who believe Lula will win the elections decided to 
start pulling out now, without panic and taking advantage of the 
good market quotations.

<F P=106> [Article by Beatriz Abreu] </F>
  [Text] Belo Horizonte -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero 
yesterday admitted that the government will adopt a fixed 
exchange rate between the real and the dollar and the other 
international hard currencies for an undetermined period of 
time. Ricupero said that the government can maintain a stable 
exchange rate because its exchange reserves amount to "much more 
than $30 billion" and he does not believe in reducing the 
profitability of exports. Ricupero said: "Most exporters are 
already closing future exchange deals [contracts through banks 
by which payment is received ahead of the actual export 
operation]." He added: "They prepare a cushion months ahead." 
  Ricupero did not say how long the government expects to 
maintain a "stable" exchange rate--given that he does not want 
to admit that the exchange policy to be adopted with the 
implementation of the real is based on freezing the exchange 
rate. He said: "It is as the poem says: Let it not be eternal 
but infinite as long as it lasts," quoting the Fidelity Sonnet 
of [Brazilian poet] Vinicius de Moraes. An economic team member 
has admitted that the URV [Real Value Unit] on 30 June will 
equal 1 real on 1 July. From then on parity with the real will 
not change. According to economic team projections, the URV on 
30 June will be equivalent to 2,614.12 real cruzeiros. 
  Ricupero said that he recently spoke with former Finance 
Minister Delfim Netto who expressed support for the "clever 
plan." Ricupero said Delfim told him he had tried to adopt the 
same program when he was a minister but was unable because the 
country then faced serious exchange problems. Ricupero stated: 
"Delfim said he needed $1 billion to establish parity between 
the dollar and the ORTN [National Readjustable Treasury Bonds], 
but the IMF refused to lend him the money." 
  The minister said the government is alert to eventual 
problems with the exchange lag. He said something "which has 
become a cliche:" He said: "Exporters always demand a 30-percent 
exchange lag." He revealed that he will negotiate with [state] 
governors the elimination of taxes on exports. He stated: 
"Negotiation is difficult, but we will try to lift the burden on 
exporters and convince the governors that with price stability, 
other tax revenues will increase." 
  Regarding salaries, the finance minister said he will not 
allow businessmen to pay for eventual wage increases with price 
increases. "We will negotiate case by case, like with the car 
industry." He said the salary mass dropped by 10 percent in real 
terms during the first few months of this year. 
  The minister said he is worried over increased consumption. 
"There might be a problem with durable goods sales because they 
already increased by 40 percent," he said. "If this trend is 
confirmed we will have to adopt further measures, but in general 
we do not believe in a consumption explosion because only 74 
percent of the industrial capability is working."

<F P=106> [Article by Leonardo Attuch: "Ricupero the Thinker"] </F>
  [Text] The differences between the new minister of finance, 
Ambassador Rubens Ricupero, and his predecessor, Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso, go beyond the difference existing between the 
discreet government official and the smiling candidate. Unlike 
the former minister, who asked that everything he ever wrote be 
forgotten--although Cardoso claims he never said it and several 
others claim they heard him say it--Ricupero takes pride in his 
literary production. 
  Whereas Cardoso throws his books on the bonfire, the 
ambassador distributes his works, even those not yet 
unpublished, and pleads with the newspapers to discuss ideas, 
concepts, and projects instead of trivial intrigues. Ricupero 
complains: "They have already tried to plant news items about 
me." 
  Despite having to administer the most delicate phase of the 
program--the building of a new currency, which is when the plan 
actually begins, according to Delfim Netto--Ricupero still finds 
time to devote himself to the study of parallel issues having to 
do with the future of the Brazilian economy. Some of his 
favorite topics are the rigidity of the labor market, the 
straitjacket that the state is in because of mandated 
expenditures, trade relations between underdeveloped countries 
and the First World, and, lastly, social security reform. 
  There are similarities, however, between Ricupero and 
Cardoso. Since Ricupero took over from Cardoso at the beginning 
of the month, both men have continued--or would like to 
continue--to be what they were before. Even as minister of 
finance, Ricupero has not stopped his classes ("it's therapy"), 
his masses at the Sao Bento Monastery, or his daily duties. Even 
as a senator, Cardoso sees himself in the role of minister of 
finance, with an eye on the success of the stabilization plan 
and the succession. "Everyone knows that the plan is mine," he 
said shortly after stepping down as minister. Seen from another 
angle, there are no differences between the two at all. Both are 
expected to vote for the same candidate in the presidential 
elections in October and November. 
<H5>  New Ideas Are Always Welcome </H5>
  One of Minister Ricupero's bedside books is that by 
economist 
Jose Pastore of the University of Sao Paulo, who compares social 
security taxes in Brazil with those in the rest of the world. 
For every cruzeiro that a businessman pays a worker, 81 centavos 
have to be sent to the government for programs concerned with 
assistance, insurance, guarantee funds, retirement, and so on. 
According to Pastore, Brazil "is a country with high social 
security taxes and low wages." 
  Ricupero supports deregulation of the labor market as a 
means 
of stimulating employment. "The results of that rigidity are an 
informal economy and under-the-counter dealings," he says. 
Pastore says that for the businessman, it is more advantageous 
to convert social security taxes into wages than to keep them as 
fixed costs payable to the government. 
  The director of the Interunion Department for Statistics and 
Socioeconomic Studies (Dieese), Sergio Mendonca, does not trust 
deregulation. "No one can guarantee that social security taxes 
would be transferred to the worker," he says. But Mendonca 
admits that the state services received by the public in 
exchange for those taxes is of extremely poor quality and 
subject to corruption. 
  In his book, Pastore shows that social security taxes are 
higher in Brazil than in any European country. The only one that 
comes close is France. 
<H5>  Reputation as `Lunatic' Does Not Worry Him </H5>
  Minister of Finance Rubens Ricupero will soon publish one of 
his latest books in Chile. Completed in March, it deals with the 
international system of trade. The title talks about 
"disagreements resulting from unrequited love," with the author 
criticizing the fact that trade in the underdeveloped world has 
been liberalized with no corresponding move by the rich 
countries. Ricupero attacks "the righteous indignation of the 
preachers of free trade, who reserve their holy anger for 
industrial subsidies while ignoring agricultural subsidies." 
  Ricupero also attacks the less transparent obstacles that 
have been replacing tariff barriers. They constitute so-called 
nontariff protectionism, in which quotas or obstacles of an 
ecological nature--such as the "green stamp"--and so on are 
adopted. But the minister does not limit his remarks to a 
Manichaean and Third-Worldist opposition between North and 
South. According to him, confrontation over liberalization has 
occurred many times between the United States and the European 
Community or, occasionally, Japan and other developed nations. 
Since Brazil's trade is diversified, Ricupero supports a general 
opening up of foreign markets. 
  The ambassador also cultivates the reputation as a "lunatic" 
which he has among some ministers, especially military 
ministers, because of his habit of expatiating on loftier 
subjects. But he describes himself as pragmatic and as a 
follower of the ethic of responsibility proposed by Max Weber, 
which says that the results of one's acts are more important 
than one's intentions. For that reason, Ricupero has been 
intransigent--as he himself admits--on the issue of the minimum 
wage. Considering all the ideas that Ricupero delves into, 
Camoes might have written: "such a big project for such a short 
life." Ricupero has less than nine months ahead of him in the 
Ministry of Finance. 
<H5>  One Complaint: the State's Straitjacket </H5>
  During his visit to Congress on Wednesday, Ambassador 
Ricupero complained about the straitjacketing of the state. "I 
am a minister of finance with control over 7 percent of the 
budget; the rest is the prisoner of mandated expenditures." 
Ricupero has been influenced by his friend, Deputy Jose Serra 
(PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], Sao Paulo), who in 
Congress is one of the main opponents of compulsory transfers. 
  Transfers to states and municipalities rose from 11.8 
percent 
of the Union's revenues in 1983 to 18.8 percent 10 years later. 
In 1992, nearly half of the social security budget was committed 
in the form of mandated expenditures. The 1988 Constitution also 
requires that 18 percent of total tax collections be spent on 
education. In the labors of Hercules involved in the economic 
plan, one of the most difficult problems was the blockage of 
funds, which instead of going to mayors and governors, had to be 
transferred to the Emergency Social Fund. 
  Serra uses the argument that mandated expenditures prevent 
the government from being flexible enough to alter priorities in 
spending, the result being a harmful effect on the tax system. 
"The Union tends to increase taxes typical of monetary policy, 
which are not transferred to the states and municipalities, in 
order to increase its revenues," the deputy says. Serra also 
says that one mandated expenditure leads to another because each 
sector is trying to defend itself. The Ministry of Health is 
demanding that 30 percent of the social security revenues be 
given to it. The government's goal under the Unified Health 
System (SUS) is to transfer income and expenditure related to 
hospital care to the state and municipal governments.

  [Excerpt] Belo Horizonte -- Finance Minister Rubens 
Ricupero on 13 May defended agrarian reform as he condemned the 
cordon established by nearly 300 people who claim to be landless 
peasants around the Finance Ministry on 12 May in Brasilia. The 
demonstrators were demanding a solution to the national land 
situation. According to Ricupero, the riot was incomprehensible 
because the Finance Ministry has nothing to do with agrarian 
reform. 
  "Personally, I am in favor of agrarian reform. At least on 
this point the peasants and I agree, because we both oppose the 
UDR [Rural Democratic Union]. The peasants should demonstrate 
against the UDR, against Caiado (meaning former UDR president 
and former Deputy Ronaldo Caiado). On 13 May, the CUT [Sole 
Workers Central] secretary general said during an interview that 
the intention is to defeat the government stability plan. What 
is the real intention behind that," the minister asked. 
  Ricupero on 13 May visited Belo Horizonte to explain the 
economic stabilization plan to Minas Gerais business people. In 
the totally full assembly hall of the Minas Gerais Business 
Federation, he paused during his explanations to speak again 
about the incidents in Brasilia. He referred to agrarian reform 
and asserted that sooner or later this problem will have to be 
solved in Brazil. 
  "With apologies to the people close to the UDR, but agrarian 
reform is necessary in this country," he said. 
  In his opinion, the government acted correctly by ordering 
the Army to intervene in the Federal Police problem. According 
to him, the government cannot allow this kind of abuse. He 
believes that the federal policemen on strike have demonstrated 
narrowmindedness by harming the population: "The people end up 
by siding against the strikers." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Josias de Souza] </F>
  [Text] Classified documents sent to President Itamar Franco 
reveal the growing problem of land distribution in Brazil. 
  Official investigations show the risk of an escalation of 
violence in the countryside. 
  The reports were prepared by the SAE, Strategic Affairs 
Secretariat, headed by Admiral Mario Cesar Flores. The 
investigation of the landless peasants began nearly two years 
ago. 
  Flores said: "The growing agrarian conflict is worrisome." 
According to him, the landless peasants "have adopted violence 
as a political method." 
  The landless peasants were the main subject of the three 
meetings President Franco held with his military ministers this 
week. 
  During a conversation with Justice Minister Alexandre 
Dupeyrat on 12 May, Deputy Luciano Pizzatto (PFL-PR) [Liberal 
Front Party-Parana] wondered whether the peasants are "arming 
themselves." 
  In the evening during another meeting, Minister Dupeyrat 
said 
seriously: "The situation is far more serious than you can 
imagine." 
  Contag [National Confederation of Farmworkers] President 
Aloisio Carneiro said the government is not well informed. "We 
do not buy weapons, nor do we support radical positions." 
  Adm. Flores did not rule out the possibility of the land 
distribution problem reaching an "untenable" stage. 
  In case it did, the problem would have to be dealt with as a 
"national security subject," and he even admitted an eventual 
intervention by the Armed Forces to control it. 
  The president and his advisers are convinced that CUT [Sole 
Workers Center], the labor union branch of the PT [Workers 
Party], is behind the radicalization of the landless peasant 
problem. 
  CUT has denied any inclination in favor of radicalizing the 
problem to use it for electoral purposes.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Marcio Moreira Alves: "Motives for Alliances"] </F>
  [Text] Lula is proposing an electoral pact directly with 
the PDT [Brazilian Labor Party] in opposition to the interests 
of party leader Leonel Brizola, whose elevation to the 
presidency is the only reason for the PDT's existence. Does Lula 
think it is possible to be successful? Obviously not. He is 
simply building a bridge to the second round of balloting with 
the intention of collecting his rival's votes without having to 
negotiate directly with that rival. The leftist leanings that he 
detects in Brizola's voters would naturally gravitate toward him. 
  The law of gravity is also preferred by social democrats 
who, 
like Mario Covas, feel nauseated at the thought of possible 
alliances with groups further to the right, examples being the 
PFL [Liberal Front Party], the PP [Progressive Party], and the 
PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]. They believe that those votes, 
lacking an alternative, will naturally trickle over to Fernando 
Henrique. 
  What must be has great strength, as they say in Minas 
Gerais, 
where it is also said that there are three forces against which 
man can do nothing: fire moving uphill, water moving downhill, 
and the Federal Government. So if electoral support is 
inevitable and the PSDB has the Federal Government's official 
candidate, why expend so much time and energy on a 
behind-the-scenes battle of the "hold me back or I'll hit him" 
variety? 
  That is the question being asked by the pragmatists. The 
question being asked by the scientists is different: in a 
country where, according to a list published by Wanderley 
Guilherme in his book Regresso (Return), 23.7 percent 
of the congressmen--representing 51 percent of the voters--have 
changed parties since the Constituent Assembly of 1988, why 
waste time with party leadership bodies? To take only one 
example, the PP was established on 31 January 1993 and has 37 
federal deputies and four senators, all of them "migrants." 
Added to that is the fact that, as Maria D'Alva Kinzo wrote in 
Radiografia do Quadro Partidario Brasileiro (X-Ray of the 
Brazilian Party Situation), half of the voters have no 
preference for any party at all, and when it comes to those who 
do have a preference, only the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party] (19.4 percent) and the PT [Workers Party] (13.6 
percent) have a significant membership. If that is the case, why 
not attempt a direct dialogue with the voters? 
  The isolationists, who oppose any and all alliances and who 
account for 35 percent of Fernando Henrique's voters in Sao 
Paulo, add another question: if 70 percent of the congressmen 
are going to be rejected by the voters in October (and the 
percentage is expected to be even higher in the Northeast), what 
kind of argument exists for an alliance with the PFL, 52 percent 
of whose congressional bloc is from the Northeast and will 
therefore be the most probable victim of that rejection? 
  The reasons for electoral nuptials, no matter how 
preposterous they may seem to the ideologically sensitive, are 
purely objective. In the first place, there is the question of 
geographical presence. Even though they have few members, the 
biggest parties have established good structures at the 
municipal level. In the 1992 elections, the PFL elected nearly 
1,000 mayors. The PSDB elected only 332, although five of those 
are in state capitals. The PTB, which supports the government as 
strongly as the PFL, elected 79 state deputies, a reasonable 
number. Miniparties such as the PDC [Christian Democratic 
Party], the PL [Liberal Party], the PRN [National Reconstruction 
Party], and so on, which are the next objective in alliances, 
elected 23 percent of the mayors in the North, 24 percent in the 
Northeast, 27 percent in the Center-West, 16 percent in the 
Southeast, and 10 percent in the South. 
  "Going it alone doesn't work," say almost all the party 
leaders. The main reason is not the need for mayors to shove the 
voters to the ballot box. It is the magic of television. 
Everybody recognizes the crucial role played by the TSE's 
[Superior Electoral Court's] free campaign programs in 
influencing decisions by the voters. Since the allotment of air 
time--already set by the electoral court--is in proportion to 
the number of congressmen in each party, alliances will decide 
which candidates have the most opportunities to present their 
platforms. Isolated candidates like Brizola and also Espiridiao 
Amin, if he accepts the challenge, will have to summarize their 
messages tremendously and run the risk of not imprinting them in 
the minds of the voters.

  [Text] San Carlos de Bariloche (NA-DYN) -- President Carlos 
Menem yesterday defended his plan to create a super-agency that 
would combine much of Argentina's law-enforcement efforts in the 
face of continued criticism even from Justicialist Party ranks. 
  The new Security Secretariat, unveiled last week, is not 
intended "to suppress potential social unrest," the President 
told reporters at the opening of the fourth Ibero-American 
Information Science and Law Congress here. 
  Rather, Menem explained, the secretariat is the product of 
six months of talks between himself and Interior Minister Carlos 
Ruckauf. He noted that other countries (the United States, 
France) and several provinces (Cordoba, Buenos Aires) already 
have similar agencies. 
  Meanwhile in Buenos Aires retired Lieutenant Julian Licastro 
remained press shy about his position as head of the future 
Security Secretariat, but opponents of President Carlos Menem's 
plan to create a new super-agency redoubled their efforts to 
make their opinion heard. 
  The former military officer and ambassador to Peru met with 
Interior Minister Ruckauf yesterday to analyze the structure of 
the new secretariat. The agency will be charged with fighting 
crime, terrorism, and drug trafficking and is to encompass the 
Federal Police, Border Guard, Coast Guard, intelligence forces, 
and Drug-Prevention Secretariat. 
  The secretariat will likely be made a full ministry 
following 
the reform of the Constitution. 
  Licasto declined to divulge details to the media following 
the talks, reporting only that he would hold a press conference 
at the "opportune moment." 
  Justicialist Deputy (Federal Capital) Miguel Angel Toma, the 
head of the Lower House defence committee, met with Presidential 
Chief-of-Staff Eduardo Bauza to express his reservations about 
the new agency, which Menem may have to create via an executive 
decree if Congress withholds its support. 
  "It is absolutely unviable, it has no legal basis and it 
will 
be quite difficult for it to provide results," Toma told the 
press before meeting Bauza at Government House. 
  Charged San Isidro Mayor Melchor Posse, a Radical, in a 
press 
release: "(Menem) is more interested in purchasing 
vomit-inducing gases and special weapons for suppression than in 
attacking the causes of public misery." 
  Buenos Aires Province Radical leader Juan Manuel Casella 
told 
Radio Mitre that the President's plans, also solidly backed by 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, are "evidence of the executive 
branch's hegemonic purposes."

<F P=106> [Interview with Grand Front, FG, leader Deputy Carlos </F>
"Chacho" Alvarez by Fernando Nole in Buenos Aires; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Nole] How do you explain the FG's spectacular 
growth in such a short time? 
  [Alvarez] Several special circumstances favored this growth. 
The Argentine bipartisan system has been suffering a slow 
process of crisis, which is not too visible when there are few 
alternatives, but which is obvious with the appearance of 
options that allow people to change their party loyalty and seek 
credibility elsewhere. I think a combination of factors fueled 
our rapid growth. 
  [Nole] How did the movement start? 
  [Alvarez] We bolted the Justicialist Party in 1990. On that 
occasion eight of us, all deputies, split following the pardon 
[of some military officers involved in the military 
dictatorship] and because the Justicialist Party became clearly 
conservative and accepted without criticism an Argentine liberal 
recipe. In 1991, we participated in the congressional election 
and obtained 3 percent of the votes. In 1992, Fernando "Pino" 
Solana ran for a seat in the Senate representing the capital and 
obtained 7.5 percent of the vote. On 3 October [1993] we ran as 
the FG for the first time. The FG is an alliance between the 
Front of the South and the Front for Democracy and Social 
Justice. We obtained 14 percent in the capital. That was 
excellent. We did a good job in the Chamber of Deputies where we 
worked hard against corruption. Then Raul Alfonsin and Carlos 
Menem signed the Olivos Pact [to reform the Constitution] which 
created an important vacuum. Many people saw the pact as a 
leadership arrangement, an ethical surrender, and as a deal 
leaving the government without opposition. We have profited the 
most from that political vacuum. 
  [Nole] Do you think your movement can continue to grow if 
the 
alliances you are negotiating with other parties succeed? 
  [Alvarez] One of the lessons of this election is that the 
number of people who will vote for a party regardless of what 
their leaders do is decreasing. I cannot say we will maintain 
our electoral strength no matter what we do. Neither can I 
affirm, as some people say, that our votes were borrowed and 
will return to their parties in the presidential election. All 
of this will depend on how we perform in the future. We are the 
third strongest political force in Argentina. First we must 
fulfill another requirement. We must create a firmer 
institutional base to prevent the front from appearing as a sum 
of other parties' leftovers. We face the challenge of creating a 
project for 1995 based on a clear program. This project must be 
clearly feasible from an economic and social perspective. This 
country tends to reject the left, even though it is a democratic 
left. The word leftist has a damned connotation. We are building 
a center-left project with the purpose of going beyond [Economy 
Minister Domingo] Cavallo's plan, which is what is sustaining 
this administration's credibility. 
  [Nole] Do you think you can challenge Carlos Menem's 
reelection if you are successful with your alliances? 
  [Alvarez] If we can organize ourselves well in the provinces 
we will be able to challenge Menem as a third option. I am not 
singing victory. I am very careful with my evaluations. We have 
a very serious responsibility. In sum, I do not know how far or 
close we are from competing for the presidency. We must be 
prepared because society is already requiring that we behave as 
if we were a serious possibility of becoming government in 
Argentina. In the street, people tell me: "Chacho, do not 
disappoint us," and; "People believe in you." An important part 
of society believes in us. 
  [Nole] Can we talk of the resurgence of the leftist vote? 
  [Alvarez] No. There is a need for a new progressive force. I 
think these 10 years of democracy can be divided in two stages. 
First there was great expectation with the Radical Civic Union 
[UCR] progressive project, which advanced in some aspects like 
the democratization of society, but which ended up failing at 
the social and economic levels. This stage was followed by 
Carlos Menem and his entirely conservative project. We may 
inherit that group of people who were disappointed by Raul 
Alfonsin's administration. This is why I believe we must 
strengthen the center-left identity. Today the UCR is again 
speaking through its most conservative spokesmen. 
  [Nole] Historic Peronism also seems to have disappeared. 
  [Alvarez] We should no longer talk about Peronism. We must 
talk about how the center-left identity can revitalize parts of 
the Peronist identity which are still very important for humble 
people. Issues such as social justice, human rights, income 
redistribution, people's participation, and a more integrated 
society are very important for them. There is much to rescue. We 
must redefine or bring back issues that are very strong in the 
Peronist tradition and which marked the memory of Peronists. 
  [Nole] If the FG gains the presidency, would you revise the 
economic transformation being implemented by Menem? 
  [Alvarez] Aside from abuses, the so-called irregularities, I 
believe it is very difficult to propose a way back in the 
Argentine society. I believe it would be very harmful to revise 
past events. To go back would be tantamount to reinstating a 
State that did not serve the people. Liberalism won the battle 
in Argentina because the State had been seized by the most 
powerful economic groups, involving a patronage-oriented, 
subsidy-oriented State. The State was a disgrace for the people. 
Public services were a disgrace. A Telephone company worker who 
collected a bribe to repair the phone was a disgrace. This was 
also the case with the gas, electricity, and water company 
workers. In other words, the recent image was that of a State 
that had turned its back on society's interests. To suggest a 
revision is tantamount to playing along with Menem and to making 
the people believe the idea of reinstating an inefficient State, 
a State entirely opposed to common good. We must build a new 
State because Menem has left us without a State. No one controls 
anything here. No one controls our food, medicines, beverages, 
or services. 
  [Nole] In your opinion, how should the state have been 
revamped? 
  [Alvarez] First, a debate deprived of so much ideology 
should 
have been conducted because market fundamentalists have been 
involved here, saying all public enterprises are bad and all 
private enterprises are good. Of course, a mixed system might 
have been proposed for some enterprises while this was not 
possible for others. I do not believe all public or state 
enterprises are necessarily bad. 
  [Nole] Yet yo believe the State may become involved in 
activities that are not proper of a State like producing 
manufacturing objects or elements? 
  [Alvarez] No. I do not believe in a State that is a 
proprietor. I do not believe in it because it is too utopian for 
Argentina today. We want a State at the service of the people, a 
State that will establish rules and a plan, keeping pace with 
the economy. 
  [Nole] Should I assume therefore that you have an entirely 
critical opinion of the convertibility plan? 
  [Alvarez] From a social viewpoint, the stability programs 
like the one implemented in our country are highly 
retrogressive. Instead of discussing convertibility, I believe 
it is necessary to strengthen stability, enabling us to discuss 
the type of country that is being planned. We want to begin this 
discussion with stability, even though this stability has a 
retrogressive bias. It is necessary for stability, like 
democracy, become an integral part of the conscience of 
Argentines and to discuss projects on this basis. 
  [Nole] Another issue. Various problems have arisen within 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. What is more advantageous 
for Argentina; regional integration or NAFTA? 
  [Alvarez] In a choice between Mercosur and NAFTA, I believe 
our country must firmly choose Mercosur because we would be 
entirely engulfed by the U.S. market if we choose NAFTA. The 
United States has great possibilities for exporting and we will 
have nothing to sell to the United States, Canada, or Mexico. We 
must firmly commit ourselves to the Mercosur. Mercosur must 
integrate the most significant economic circles with small- and 
medium-size enterprises. We must jointly review the competitive 
and distributive advantages and Argentina must correct its 
significant trade imbalance with Brazil. In a nutshell, I see a 
great future for Mercosur. Furthermore, I believe the bloc's 
integration is inexorable because there can be no economic 
solution unless we project our industry and commerce on a large 
scale and integrated into regional blocs. The best way to 
protect the domestic market is not by subsidizing enterprises 
for this domestic market but by assisting and fostering 
industries that might successfully compete abroad. 
  [Nole] In conclusion, did you use the experience of the 
Uruguayan Broad Front [FA] as an example when you formed the FG? 
  [Alvarez] No. We have always respected and recognized it. We 
were greatly encouraged by the Uruguayan experience because in 
your country there was also a marked bipartisan system. The FA 
was established in 1970. It endures, it has been able to 
withstand time, and it could achieve a majority in your country. 
The FA won the Montevideo mayoralty and has a good rating on the 
polls to contend for running the government. In this regard, we 
have always viewed the FA with great recognition and it is very 
encouraging to see how this party has been able to keep up and 
grow. I believe countries develop a progressive democratic 
alternative in keeping with the characteristics and beliefs of 
societies.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 May (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella stated today that he is "pessimistic" over a possible 
agreement with Great Britain for joint exploitation of oil on 
the Malvinas Islands. He admitted that the problems with the 
islanders are currently "the same as those of 160 years ago." 
  The foreign minister thus referred to reports that indicate 
that the Kelpers [Falklands Islanders] could negotiate the 
exploration for oil with Chile, and that in no way will they 
accept a joint venture with Argentina. 
  Di Tella said that this topic "is in no way new" because 
"the 
British do not want Argentines on the islands, but they do not 
have the same reserve for the Chileans." 
  In remarks to a radio station, the foreign minister termed 
the position of the islanders as "lamentable," and warned that 
the lack of contact with the continent "will in time become a 
ridiculous whim." 
  Regarding the July 1994 meeting between Argentine and 
British 
delegations to evaluate possible bilateral cooperation in the 
extraction of oil in the area, Di Tella highlighted his 
"pessimism" on the probability of reaching an agreement. 
  "We have said we are willing to cooperate on the oil topic 
before seeking a definite solution to the problem of 
sovereignty," he explained. 
  The foreign minister said the results of the negotiations 
are 
negative, adding that Argentina "will legally oppose oil 
exploitation." 
  Although he acknowledged that "until now the Kelpers have 
been willing to evaluate the topic of cooperation," Di Tella 
believes "this could or could not imply Argentina's presence on 
the islands." 
  "With respect to the Malvinas Islands, I believe our overall 
relations suffer the same problems as 160 years ago," the 
foreign minister admitted, adding that the government "is 
treating the situation with much greater importance than before." 
  The foreign minister acknowledged that "very important 
progress has been made in communication with the islanders, 
despite official resistance." 
  "I have written letters, sent them presents, spoken over the 
radio, and publicly acknowledged that we believe it is important 
to recognize their way of life. But we are still far from a 
normal relationship," the foreign minister said about the 
Kelpers. 
  Di Tella did not reject the possibility that Great Britain 
may contract enterprises from other countries to extract oil, 
although he added: "This invitation will be difficult for them 
because no one will want to participate in a zone that is in 
litigation and where Argentina can proceed legally against 
anyone who cooperates in the exploitation." 
  Asked to name the organizations before which Argentina could 
submit its complaints, the foreign minister replied: "The United 
Nations and the courts of the countries that import the oil." 
  With respect to the participation of YPF [Government Oil 
Deposits] in the bid to exploit oil through the Romano Houston 
enterprise, which apparently bought plans of the areas where oil 
presumably exists on the islands, Di Tella stated that he did 
not know if the area is rich in oil. 
  Regarding the purchase of plans, Di Tella explained that "it 
was simply a way for YPF to obtain information," adding that 
"some very serious people believe there is no oil on the 
islands." 
  Finally, the foreign minister stated that the agenda for the 
July summit "does not contain the topic of a possible visit of 
President Carlos Menem to Great Britain."

  [Text] Cordoba, 17 May (NA) -- Engineer Luis Murgio, one 
of the scientists from Cordoba Province who has developed a 
satellite that will be launched at the end of 1995, has 
travelled to Moscow to coordinate the launch with Russian 
authorities. 
  The first satellite from Cordoba was developed within the 
sphere of the province's Science and Technology Secretariat with 
the participation of a group of researchers that had worked on 
the now-deactivated Condor-II project. 
  The research activities were supported by the National 
Atomic 
Energy Commission in the province through the state enterprise 
CORATEC [expansion not given], which was created in 1992. 
  The project will have a final cost of some $1.2 billion, and 
it is thought that most of it has been built in Cordoba, 
although it does have some imported parts. 
  The satellite, which is the size of a shoe box, will be used 
for agricultural, geological, and environmental purposes.

  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani said today that he does 
not recognize the government installed in Haiti by a group of 
legislators supported by the Army of that country. He said this 
move is only a measure to ease international pressure applied 
mainly by the United Nations and the OAS on the Republic of 
Haiti, but these appointments do not reflect the people's will. 
  Yesterday, a group of legislators supported by the Army 
swore 
in a new president in Haiti, and according to international 
reports, this is a measure to complete the toppling of 
constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who has been in 
exile since 1991. The new president is Emile Jonassaint, 80, a 
former magistrate of the Haitian Supreme Court, but 
international news dispatches indicate that his government lacks 
the support of the international community and of most Haitian 
legislators. 
  During a news conference Cristiani also commented on the 
progress in peace agreements compliance only days before he 
concludes his term. He said that the only agreement that will 
be left pending pertains to public security, because, as he has 
stated before, the government thinks that it is necessary to 
prolong the transition from the National Police [PN] to the 
National Civilian Police (PNC) as a result of the increased 
crime rate in the country. Cristiani had said that the 
dismantling of the PN could last another six months until the 
PNC gets enough members to fight crime. 
  We think that it would be a serious mistake to leave the 
country with 5,700 agents and conclude the dissolution of the 
PN," the president said. [no opening quotation marks as 
published] He proposed that "the PN continue operating, and of 
course, also reduce its size while the Public Security Academy 
supplies the PNC with agents." Cristiani said that public 
safety is still a priority, and thus, the next government will 
continue to support efforts in this area and to support the 
Public Security Academy, which is tasked with training the 
agents of the new security corps. 
  As for the reports of kidnappings, the president reaffirmed 
that the government is tackling this problem by deploying PNC 
agents to Santa Ana. He added that these are not "groups of 
organized kidnappers that we have seen in the past but criminal 
groups that will not be difficult to bring to justice. We hope 
to be able to neutralize this wave of extortions in Santa Ana in 
the short run." 
  President Cristiani today inaugurated the Second 
International Environmental Conference in San Salvador.

  [Excerpts] A special ceremony was held at the Ecuadoran 
Foreign Ministry this afternoon between Salvadoran Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria and Ecuadoran Foreign Minister 
Diego Paredes Pena. After signing some treaties and agreements, 
both foreign ministers met with reporters. Salvadoran Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria was asked the most questions by 
journalists. They questioned him about various topics of 
national and international interest. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] I have a question 
for both foreign ministers. Regarding the situation in Haiti, 
would your government support an armed intervention? 
  [Paredes] We believe in democracy, and we hope Haiti will 
soon return to democracy. We believe all necessary steps must 
be taken within the framework of respect for the will and 
self-determination of peoples for the return of democracy. We 
believe the de facto rulers of Haiti and President Jean Bertrand 
Aristide are greatly responsible for ensuring the country's 
return to a democratic system. We in Ecuador do not believe in 
armed intervention. We believe in the free will of the people, 
and we hope that the pressures that have been applied will be 
enough to make the de facto authorities act sensibly and allow 
that country to live in democracy. 
  [Reporter] The same question for the Salvadoran foreign 
minister. 
  [Salaverria] We are thinking along the same lines. The use 
of force is increasingly less necessary. Once we have an 
international market that adheres to the GATT, I believe the 
pressures that may be applied in the area of trade might be 
stronger and more effective than a military force. An embargo 
has been tried in Haiti, and it has not yielded results. Other 
methods are being tried out to make it work, however. As the 
foreign minister said, de facto military rulers have a huge 
responsibility to their people and to the international 
community. The position they have maintained cannot be kept up 
much longer. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Interview with Daniel Ortega, general secretary of the 
Nicaraguan Sandinist National Liberation Front, by Noel Irias; 
place and date not given; first three paragraphs are 
introduction by Irias] 
  [Text] FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] Secretary 
General Daniel Ortega has announced that his party will promote 
a broad policy of alliances, including the Higher Council of 
Private Enterprise [COSEP], to work on a nationwide program that 
will go beyond electoral periods and party interests. 
  The Sandinist leader said that he favors the existence of 
several candidates for the post of FSLN secretary general but 
emphasized the need to protect the methods and mechanisms to 
protect party unity. 
  Ortega also called for a change in mentality within the FSLN 
to promote more initiatives within the rank-and-file 
organizations. 
  [Irias] Why did you announce that you were giving up a 
possible presidential candidacy in 1996? 
  [Ortega] I can understand why people are so skeptical but I 
have maintained that I did not enter the FSLN to hold a post in 
the FSLN or in the government. I did not join the FSLN to 
become president. In this stage of much discussion, some people 
have been spreading the notion that I covet the presidency 
again. I think this should be clarified. To me, this is an 
ethical and moral issue. I do not desire to be president. I 
have said this before and I reiterate it now. This is the true 
reason, more so than national considerations. In addition, to 
speak of running as a candidate is premature. Yes, I think the 
1996 program should be of national unity. It is the only thing 
that can save the country, regardless of whether or not there 
are very polarized forces in the country. 
  [Irias] What do you think should be the mechanism used to 
select the FSLN's presidential candidate? 
  [Ortega] The most important consideration should be the 
program, which must be debated and approved democratically. The 
program must be discussed with mass participation. This is even 
more important than the mass participation in the election of 
the candidates themselves. The people will vote for a program. 
The decision for a candidate is a very important complementary 
issue. The candidate will have to be selected according to the 
political circumstances. It will be necessary to decide whether 
or not the FSLN will run by itself or as part of an alliance. 
After the congress, the Sandinist Assembly will meet to 
stimulate a broad policy of alliances by inviting meetings with 
different sectors, including COSEP, workers, producers, and 
businessmen to draft a countrywide plan or program that goes 
beyond electoral campaigns and party interests. We will later 
consider the formula, who will head this proposal, who will hold 
posts in the National Assembly or municipal governments. 
  [Irias] Would you agree that FSLN candidates be selected in 
the departments? 
  [Ortega] I agree completely. The candidates should be 
selected in a process headed by the Sandinists but which should 
involve the largest possible number of followers and friends, so 
our candidates can have or win the support of the majority of 
the population. 
  [Irias] What about consulting with the rank and file 
regarding the FSLN candidates? 
  [Ortega] The ideal thing would be for the formula to emerge 
from intuition and political savvy. But this would be 
insufficient if the rank and file are not consulted. This is 
very important to consolidate the candidacy. A mechanism such 
as the one used in Costa Rica, based on primaries, was 
considered when the party statutes were debated, but it was 
ruled out for material reasons. Anyway, the candidate must be 
consulted with the rank and file. 
  [Irias] Why do you regard as risky the existence of other 
candidacies, Henry Ruiz in this instance, for the post of 
secretary general? 
  [Ortega] This is by itself a healthy principle. It is a way 
such candidacies can be established, which requires careful 
attention. If these candidacies lead to confrontations or 
maneuvers typical of traditional parties, this is not healthy 
because it conspires against unity. It is like prodding others 
to fight, like sowing discord. The FSLN statutes establish the 
right of active members to run as candidates. Therefore, there 
can be several candidates for secretary general. The important 
thing is that this electoral process take place in a friendly 
and constructive manner, protecting the Sandinist unity. 
  [Irias] Would you back Commander Tomas Borge's candidacy if 
he ran for FSLN president? 
  [Ortega] We have broached this topic on previous occasions. 
In the First Congress we analyzed whether the post of FSLN 
president, such as in other parties, was convenient or not. I 
believe Commander Borge's qualities, a historic FSLN cadre, an 
FSLN founder, an anti-Somozist, and an anti-imperialist who 
spent time in jail after Somoza -- and Carlos Fonseca campaigned 
for his release -- give him unquestionable merits and if he were 
FSLN president he would enhance Sandinism. 
  [Irias] Would you back that candidacy? 
  [Ortega] Yes. 
<H5>  Differences in the Opposition </H5>
  [Irias] How do you perceive the concept of self-defense? 
  [Ortega] The things that happen in Nicaragua are not common 
in other parts of the world, such as our 216 comrades who were 
murdered in Jinotega. When a government or appropriate 
authority does not have the capacity to protect its citizens, 
the population not only has a right, but has a duty to create 
the self-defense mechanisms to survive. 
  [Irias] Any other social group could use this argument to 
arm 
themselves. How would you resolve this situation? 
  [Ortega] The ideal situation is not that every person should 
seek a self-defense mechanism. We cannot encourage that. We 
have to exert pressure on the government to ensure that the 
appropriate institutions maintain citizens' order and security. 
We cannot encourage self-defense, but we cannot condemn it in 
the cases such as I mentioned. 
  [Irias] What are the in-depth differences in this FSLN 
internal debate? 
  [Ortega] The in-depth differences have to do with the 
contradictions in Nicaraguan society, which are then blamed on 
Sandinism. This causes a break-up with smaller groups each 
going their own way. 
  That is why the main theme in this congress has to do with 
the interpretation all Sandinists have to make on the concept of 
opposition. This is a key issue -- to agree among us how to 
face government policies -- this has to do with methods of 
struggle and each sector will struggle the best it can. 
  We are obliged to stir awareness so as to ensure that people 
defend their own interests. 
  [Irias] Is the FSLN secretary general not concerned that the 
constitutional order, the legality that your government created, 
may be adversely affected at some time by groups making claims? 
  [Ortega] We have to defend the institutions, the legal 
state, 
it is a principle. This is so governments do not create 
policies that generate greater tension and serve as a culture 
medium for violence. The original sin is government policies. 
<H5>  Forefront Party? </H5>
  [Irias] The FSLN has enormous political power and 
institutional power quotas, and can use them to influence the 
government to reduce institutional violence. Will the FSLN 
wield this political influence quota on the other aspect of the 
problem? 
  [Ortega] If the FSLN had used its influence in a coherent 
and 
coordinated manner we could have avoided a series of events that 
the government has caused. 
  The government feels safe with what it can do because the 
FSLN is unwilling to make true opposition. If we leap in that 
direction the outcome will be favorable for the country because 
it is a way to avoid violent behavior. 
  Provided the FSLN defends the institutions and policies in 
favor of the people, conditions will be right for the people to 
trust these mechanisms and not be forced, in desperation, to 
seek violence. 
  [Irias] Do you hope to rebuild the FSLN as a vanguard party? 
  [Ortega] It seems to me that the term vanguard made sense 
when we fought Somoza, when the FSLN was clearly a vanguard, a 
very small political-military detachment that was at the 
forefront in the struggle against the dictatorship. 
  Afterward, when in government, the FSLN became the party of 
the masses. We need a revolutionary party that is organized in 
accordance with how we currently live. 
  The most important thing after the congress is the FSLN 
opening and a deep change in our mentality and in ways we 
organize and communicate with the people. We need to break away 
from the concept of directorate organizations that dictate lines 
of work. We need to be agents of change to encourage 
decisionmaking among grass root organizations. We need to 
ensure that leaders possess proposals made by the rank and file. 
  [Irias] Would you eventually back General Humberto Ortega's 
candidacy in 1996? 
  [Ortega] It is too early to speak of candidacies. It seems 
risky to speak hypothetically. I have to be very careful 
because it could be assumed that I am backing certain 
candidacies.

  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, the new president of the 
Republic, yesterday explained that his campaign slogan "the 
people to power" could have been misinterpreted by his followers 
and the rest of the country. The issue came up as a result of 
criticism of Perez Balladares' offer to men like Guillermo 
Chapman and Ricardo Alberto Arias, considered members of the 
oligarchy, to hold positions in his government. 
  "It is a problem of conceptual definition," Perez said. He 
added that "the people to power" does not necessarily mean that 
all the ministers or directors of the autonomous institutions 
must be very poor people. This means, the president-elect said, 
that the government's policy must, above all, protect the 
interests of the people but this must also be done with 
everyone's participation. 
  "People does not mean only the poor; people means all of 
Panama and there are not only whites and blacks in Panama; there 
is a little of every one and that is the way I plan to compose 
my government, with everyone," Perez Balladares said. 
  According to the president-elect, he cannot please everyone 
and he is convinced that his commitment is to the Panamanian 
people. Perez Balladares admitted that he is a realist and that 
he only received one-third of the votes. Perez Balladares added 
that the other two-thirds are not his enemies, but they did not 
vote for him. Perez Balladares views what happened as a people's 
mandate to attain national consensus and this is precisely what 
he is trying to do. 
  According to the president-elect, there are two things he 
cannot do. He cannot disregard the issue of a national consensus 
because he believes this is what the country needs; nor can he 
disregard his party, the one with the most votes in the country. 
These are the two factors he is attempting to bring together. 
  In this regard, Perez Balladares said that his party will 
have a majority participation in his government, but there must 
also be participation of the independent forces. He has also 
invited Panamanians who are members of other parties to 
participate in his government. 
<H5>  More Appointments to the New Cabinet Announced </H5>
  Meanwhile, the Democratic Revolutionary Party's [PRD] press 
office has announced new appointments of ministers and directors 
of autonomous institutions that will make up the new Perez 
Balladares government. Among those on the list of future 
ministers are: Housing Minister Dr. Francisco Sanchez Cardenas, 
Labor and Social Welfare Minister Mitchel Doens, and Public 
Works Minister Luis Blanco. Two women will head the Commerce and 
Industry and the Government and Justice ministries; however, 
their names were not disclosed. Dr. Hugo Torrijos Richa has been 
appointed to head the National Port Authority. 
  Prior to these appointments it was announced that Gabriel 
Lewis Galindo would be the new foreign minister; Raul Arango, 
the new minister of the presidency; and Olmedo Miranda Jr., the 
new finance minister. 
  A PRD source, who requested to remain anonymous said that 
many within the party are not pleased because "almost all the 
ministers appointed are of the oligarchy," thus ignoring the 
slogan "the people to power" that Perez Balladares used during 
the campaign. 
  The source also said that there is a "rivalry between the 
Public Force [FP] officials and the former Defense Forces 
offices. The FP officials have expressed their strongest 
opposition to the appointment of a single member of the former 
Defense Forces to the Public Force. These former Defense Forces 
officers thought that once Perez Balladares won the election 
they would return to power, the source said. 
  According to the source, as far as the FP officials are 
concerned, "it is impossible to incorporate those officers into 
the FP because they are accustomed to repressing civilians and 
violating human rights. How can they be part of an organization 
created to defend democracy and the rights of citizens?" 
  The source also said that Balbina Herrera is the PRD member 
who is the most upset with Perez Balladares' conduct.

<F P=106> [Article by Socorro Lopez Espinosa] </F>
  [Text] The free trade agreements being negotiated with 
Central America and other areas in Latin America "are not and 
will not be a free ticket for access to NAFTA." We will 
negotiate with each country or group of countries in accordance 
with the interests of each. In addition, the agreements with 
Central America are "to promote rather than to regulate trade" 
as was the case with the two North American countries. 
  Herminio Blanco, deputy secretary of International Trade 
Relations of the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial 
Development (Secofi), and Jesus Flores Ayala in charge of Latin 
American negotiations for the Secofi, expressed themselves in 
these terms while participating in a course on "Public 
Administration Vis-a-vis the New Dimensions of Foreign Trade 
between Mexico and Central American Countries," which was 
organized by the Secofi and the National Public Administration 
Institute (INAP). 
  Herminio Blanco pointed out that Mexico is interested in 
negotiating with Central American countries: Honduras, El 
Salvador, and Guatemala (Mexico has already signed an agreement 
with Costa Rica), but as to how far and how these nations want 
to negotiate with Mexico must be determined. Besides, it is up 
to the Central Americans to decide if they want to join NAFTA. 
  The Partial Reach Agreements [Acuerdos de Alcance Parcial, 
AAP] are a very "old" model no longer functional within the 
framework of ongoing economic and trade globalization. What is 
more, of the agreements currently in force only 50 percent of a 
total of 1,000 tariffs are being used. Through these agreements 
Mexico has imported only $51 million from Central America, 
two-thirds of this amount from Guatemala. That is why free 
trade agreements are sought to modernize relationships in order 
to encourage investments and joint investments, to exchange 
technology, and to create jobs, in essence for the economic 
development of countries, Blanco stressed. 
  He made clear that the rules of origin established in trade 
agreements with Mexico are simple, and above all seek to reduce 
costs and avoid the illegal transshipment of goods. The 
established rules are balanced according to the interests and 
competitive capacity of the countries seeking free trade. 
  In addition, Jesus Flores Ayala, in charge of negotiations 
with Latin America, warned that agreements such as that signed 
with Costa Rica "are not a free ticket for access to NAFTA" 
because the grounds for negotiations on specific items are 
different, in the long run they might be complementary, but it 
is obvious certain adjustments have to be made to comply with 
NAFTA provisions. 
  The Central and South American countries must evaluate "if 
they are or are not in condition to compete on an international 
level with prevalent market conditions." In this sense, for 
example, Guatemala and Honduras should define what they want to 
do in trade, whether to negotiate bilaterally or as a group with 
El Salvador. This is despite a long-standing "political 
agreement" that all three Central American nations together 
would negotiate with Mexico. While they decide about their 
positions, we must not lose any time and must continue to 
negotiate, Flores Ayala said. 
  Lastly, Herminio Blanco stressed the importance of updating 
relations between countries, and seeking opportunities and 
access to markets within the context of equality and mutual 
benefits.

  [Text] Mexico City, 10 May (NOTIMEX) -- Agrarian Reform 
Under Secretary Gustavo Gordillo de Anda exchanged information 
and experiences on agrarian topics with a Chinese delegation led 
by Agriculture Vice Minister Liu Chengguo. 
  In the meeting, the goal of which was to strengthen 
bilateral 
relations, they analyzed cooperation for various programs and 
projects to help rural producers. Gordillo de Anda stressed 
that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has paid special 
attention to the rural sector through the reforms of 
Constitutional Article 27 and the new agrarian law. 
  Chengguo said his country is taking several actions to 
overcome the crisis in the countryside, including the 
elimination of the commune system and the organization of 
cooperatives that will permit the development of the Chinese 
countryside. He said his country views exchange and cooperation 
with Mexico as important because its experience in investment, 
support, and autonomy for peasants is valuable and will be 
useful for China. 
  The members of the Chinese delegation met with the heads of 
the Agrarian Prosecutor's Office and the National Agrarian 
Registry [Registro Agrario Nacional -- RAN], with whom they 
exchanged viewpoints on the Procede [expansion unknown] and RAN 
programs. 
  The meeting was also attended by Senior Officer Raul Pineda 
Pineda, Agrarian Organization Director Ricardo Chavez Perez, and 
Rosalia Enciso of the Foreign Secretariat.

  [Text] Presidential candidates today started the final leg 
of their campaign for the 29 May elections. Polls revealing a 
virtual tie between the two favorite candidates, Liberal Party's 
Ernesto Samper and Conservative Party's Andres Pastrana, are the 
highlight of this electoral period. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Miguel Maza 
Marquez, [National Civic Consensus] presidential candidate, 
today visited the most populated Barranquilla neighborhoods. 
Tradesmen, small-scale industrialists, and union leaders of the 
Atlantic region accompanied him during his visit. Maza talked 
about the need to make the vote compulsory in Colombia to 
increase voter turnout rates. 
  Meanwhile, before the 12 May televised presidential debate, 
polls showed Samper and Pastrana were virtually tied for the 
first round of presidential elections. Samper garnered 42.9 
percent support of those polled, while Pastrana garnered 42 
percent. After the debate, a poll released by the CMI Newscast 
on the night of 13 May showed the popularity rates of the two 
candidates continued to be virtually tied. Samper registered 
44.6 percent, while Pastrana registered 44.3 percent. 
  In another turn of events, presidential candidate Jose 
Antonio Cortez of the Christian Union Movement [Movimiento de 
Union Cristiana] promised to restore the social and moral values 
of Colombian families. 
  [Cortez] We believe broken homes create violent individuals 
in the country. 
  [Reporter] Meanwhile, presidential candidate Guillermo 
Barbosa said his goal is to reach national peace. 
  [Barbosa] Peace is the solution to all the problems faced by 
Colombian people. To that effect, we require a government 
program that will invest heavily in the social sector. [end

  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani said today that he does 
not recognize the government installed in Haiti by a group of 
legislators supported by the Army of that country. He said this 
move is only a measure to ease international pressure applied 
mainly by the United Nations and the OAS on the Republic of 
Haiti, but these appointments do not reflect the people's will. 
  Yesterday, a group of legislators supported by the Army 
swore 
in a new president in Haiti, and according to international 
reports, this is a measure to complete the toppling of 
constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who has been in 
exile since 1991. The new president is Emile Jonassaint, 80, a 
former magistrate of the Haitian Supreme Court, but 
international news dispatches indicate that his government lacks 
the support of the international community and of most Haitian 
legislators. 
  During a news conference Cristiani also commented on the 
progress in peace agreements compliance only days before he 
concludes his term. He said that the only agreement that will 
be left pending pertains to public security, because, as he has 
stated before, the government thinks that it is necessary to 
prolong the transition from the National Police [PN] to the 
National Civilian Police (PNC) as a result of the increased 
crime rate in the country. Cristiani had said that the 
dismantling of the PN could last another six months until the 
PNC gets enough members to fight crime. 
  We think that it would be a serious mistake to leave the 
country with 5,700 agents and conclude the dissolution of the 
PN," the president said. [no opening quotation marks as 
published] He proposed that "the PN continue operating, and of 
course, also reduce its size while the Public Security Academy 
supplies the PNC with agents." Cristiani said that public 
safety is still a priority, and thus, the next government will 
continue to support efforts in this area and to support the 
Public Security Academy, which is tasked with training the 
agents of the new security corps. 
  As for the reports of kidnappings, the president reaffirmed 
that the government is tackling this problem by deploying PNC 
agents to Santa Ana. He added that these are not "groups of 
organized kidnappers that we have seen in the past but criminal 
groups that will not be difficult to bring to justice. We hope 
to be able to neutralize this wave of extortions in Santa Ana in 
the short run." 
  President Cristiani today inaugurated the Second 
International Environmental Conference in San Salvador.

  [Text] Caracas, 16 May (AFP) -- The Police Operations 
Command has informed AFP that students from a vocational school 
in downtown Caracas today looted a grocery truck. Also, police 
in a nearby area arrested two troublemakers, seizing from them 
an Army pistol and another .38-caliber weapon. 
  Meanwhile, in the Montalban area in northwestern Caracas and 
on Baralt Avenue in downtown Caracas, students staged two other 
marches on Monday morning but they did not degenerate into riots. 
  At Candelaria Square in downtown Caracas, about midday today 
residents blocked traffic to protest the shortage of water, 
another ill affecting residents of Caracas due to the protracted 
drought that began late last year. 
  Over the past two weeks, violent student demonstrations have 
been staged in Caracas and 10 other Venezuelan cities. These 
demonstrations have resulted in the death of one student amid 
renewed rumors of a coup d'etat and the bolivar's drastic 
decline on the parallel market, where it is now selling for 153 
units per dollar. 
  Foreseeing an intensification of the disturbances, Defense 
Minister General Rafael Montero Revette said the Army is 
prepared to implement the "Avila" and "Sovereignty" plans which 
would require the militarization of Caracas and the entire 
country.

<F P=106> [Report by Darwin Romero Montiel from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Confirmation of the subsidized student bus fare is 
the condition students are demanding to halt disturbances. A 
meeting was held behind closed doors at the Interior Ministry 
between representatives of the government and secondary and 
higher education students. Reporters had to wait outside the 
Ministry to learn the results of this meeting. The interior, 
education, and transport and communications ministers, and the 
Federal District governor were questioned by the secondary and 
higher education students regarding the violence in recent days 
in Caracas and the rest of the country. The first to leave the 
meeting was a secondary school student from the Fermin Toro 
secondary school who expressed his discontent. He indicated that 
no definite solution was found at the meeting. 
  [Begin unidentified student recording] They defended 
themselves [words indistinct] that President Caldera would come 
out to say that it was a lie, that the [word indistinct] did not 
agree with that document. This is just political chicanery. [end 
recording] 
  The first questions Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom 
had 
to answer concerned the remarks by the prosecutor general who 
justified the use of firearms by police during student 
demonstrations. 
  [Begin Escovar Salom recording] They have regulation weapons 
and their use is regulated. Therefore, I do not know in what 
sense the prosecutor general expressed his opinion, but I 
imagine that it is legally well-grounded. [end recording] 
  No concrete solution to the recent student problems came out 
of the meeting. In any case, the students reiterated that the 
violence will not stop until the transport and communications 
minister publicly states that the student fare, which is 
scheduled to be eliminated on 31 July, will continue to be valid.

  [Text] More than 60 lawmakers have signed an abridged 
constitutional reform project that Congress President Gonzalo 
Aguirre yesterday handed over to the Electoral Court for 
ratification by voters in the national elections scheduled for 
27 November. 
  Yesterday afternoon Aguirre summoned journalists to report 
on 
the project, during a ceremony that was attended--among 
others--by dissidents of the Party for the Government by the 
People, Hector Lescano, and the Herreraists who support Alberto 
Volonte's candidacy. 
  The project was submitted under the terms of a paragraph of 
Article 331 of the Constitution. 
  Aguirre said: "This is the crowning point in a long 
constitutional reform process in which many political sectors 
have engaged. We want to implement this reform, which will begin 
a process through which the country will reach true electoral 
freedom." 
  Aguirre added that the idea is that the process should not 
be 
finalized with this partial-scope referendum, but "next year, 
without electoral constraints, we should work in Congress to 
complete this process and achieve fuller electoral freedom." 
  He emphasized "the perseverance of sectors that advocate the 
reform" and the "ethical attitude" toward the subject. 
  "This ceremony marks the beginning of a period that extends 
up to the elections, during which we will promote this project, 
showing to citizens that they will be the beneficiaries of the 
reform because of the freedom they will enjoy," Aguirre said. 
  The following are some of the main innovations of the 
project: 
  -- Departmental Boards may modify budget bills only to 
increase revenues or reduce spending, and may not create jobs on 
their own initiative or approve any project that will generate a 
deficit. 
  -- Alternate members may not automatically join Departmental 
Boards. 
  -- Departmental Board members (councilmen) will earn a 
monthly salary that will be established by the board before they 
are elected. This also applies to the mayor. The salary may not 
be modified during the five-year tenure. Members may not receive 
other benefits (like gasoline vouchers, etc.). 
  -- Departmental Boards will have a new structure, with 31 
members in Montevideo, 25 in Canelones, and 21 in the other 
departments. 
  -- The amendment of Article 77 of the Constitution allows 
citizens to make a so-called "crossed vote," that is, voting for 
one party ticket at the national level (president and vice 
president of the Republic, Senate, and Chamber of Deputies) and 
for another ticket at a department level (mayor and departmental 
board members). This means that citizens may vote--for 
example--for a National Party candidate for president and for a 
Colorado Party candidate for mayor.

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Residents of the (Nimacuyu) neighborhood in Zone 21 
last Friday tried to lynch a U.S. woman whom they claimed had 
stolen a child. The Attorney General's Office denied she had 
kidnapped the child, disclosing that there are legal adoption 
papers in an auxiliary office of the Attorney General's Office 
in Coban, Alta Verapaz. Francisco Daniel Flores, delegate from 
the Coban office, explained the case: 
  [Begin recording] [Flores] Yes, it is true. At the Coban 
agency of the Attorney General's Office, we have studied the 
legal adoption papers of those gringos who appeared yesterday on 
television. They have complied with all the requirements 
demanded by the law, and their papers are in order in our office 
as well as in the court that has made the financial 
investigations. The mother was summoned by our agency, and she 
voluntarily turned over the little girl. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Who are the parents of this minor? 
  [Flores] I cannot remember the woman's name right now, but 
she lives in the Canton Las Casas neighborhood in Coban, Alta 
Verapaz. She has 12 children, and there are documents that prove 
she has given up another child for adoption. 
  [Reporter] Did she sell her child, or was the child taken 
away from her against her will? 
  [Flores] As guarantors of the investigations we conduct with 
regard to adoption, we summoned the mother, and she testified 
that she gave up the child for adoption of her own will. She 
says she cannot support this child because she has too many 
children. She is looking out for the child's well-being, and 
therefore she prefers to give her up for adoption. 
  [Reporter] She did not sell the child? 
  [Flores] Not at all, and there are witnesses at the agency 
where she said that she had given the child away as a gift and 
she had not sold the child, as many people claim. I repeat, the 
woman has 12 other children, and she previously gave up another 
child for adoption. She cannot support the children; she cannot 
buy food for them. 
  [Reporter] How about the U.S. woman? Who is she, and what 
does she do? 
  [Flores] Prior to legalizing the adoption, we investigated 
the dossier. We saw the dossier included authorization by the 
U.S. Embassy allowing the woman to adopt the child. 
  [Reporter] Why was the U.S. woman interested in this minor? 
  [Flores] The couple has problems and cannot have babies. 
They wanted to have a child, and, when the opportunity to adopt 
this Guatemalan child arose, they said they wanted this child. 
  [Reporter] How long have they been working on this adoption? 
  [Flores] They have been working on this adoption for 
approximately six months. They have been in Coban since last 
December when they started the legal adoption paperwork. 
  [Reporter] How many adoption cases have you processed in 
this 
agency? 
  [Flores] This is the first adoption case I have processed in 
the time that I have been working in Coban. 
  [Reporter] How does the father of the child feel about this? 
  [Flores] Unfortunately, the child is not a legitimate child, 
and there is no record of who her father is. We have only 
talked with the mother of the child. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] Managua Canal Cuatro Television in 
Spanish at 0430 GMT on 14 May broadcasts a 75-minute interview 
with Nicaraguan General Humberto Ortega, chief of the Sandinist 
People's Army (EPS), by Canal Cuatro News Director Manuel 
Espinosa Henriquez at the station's studios in Managua. The 
interview is live or recorded. 
  Espinosa begins the interview by asking Ortega why 21 
February 1995 was chosen as the date for his retirement. The 
general replies the date is the result of the two-year process 
under which the new military code was drawn up. Ortega says: 
"The agreement we reached has now become very important for the 
nation's stability." He adds: "My retirement, which has been 
highly politicized, has been practically resolved within the 
framework of the military code and within a framework of a 
solution acceptable to the executive, as well as to the EPS." 
  When asked whether he chose the date of his retirement or 
whether President Violeta Chamorro chose it, Ortega replies that 
the date was agreed upon by the two sides. 
  The general says he had agreed with President Chamorro to 
confirm his retirement date and to unveil the new draft Military 
Organization Law in the afternoon of 18 May. Ortega says: "What 
is most important is that this is being done based on an 
understanding and a rapprochement that takes important 
considerations into account." 
  Espinosa continues by asking Ortega whether other EPS 
officers will also be retiring. Ortega replies that, at this 
time, no one else will be retiring, because junior officers 
still need to be trained to fill upper-level positions. Ortega 
adds that he had never planned to stay in the Army his entire 
life. 
  The discussion turns to the amount of time the next EPS 
chief 
will remain in the post. Ortega says an agreement has been 
reached on the tenure of this post, which will run about the 
same length as the presidential term of five years. 
  In response to a follow-up question, Ortega says the choice 
of the new EPS chief will be based on the military career of 
various candidates, adding that the chief will be chosen from 
the High Military Command. 
  After Espinosa asks who indeed will be chosen to replace him 
as commander of the EPS, Ortega says the Military Council will 
review and examine the merits of all candidates, and it will 
then present its findings to the president in accordance with 
the military code. Ortega adds that he will be leaving the Army 
with the satisfaction of knowing he has fulfilled his role. 
  Espinosa then questions Ortega on his plans following 
retirement. The general responds by saying any position he might 
hold as a civilian will not prevent him from "contributing to 
the freedom and full democracy" that Nicaragua has yet to enjoy. 
Ortega says he will devote himself to working with those who 
are interested in finding a solution to the critical situation 
facing Nicaragua. 
  He says: "I honestly am not interested in becoming actively 
involved in any specific political post. Instead, I feel the 
duty and the need, as a Nicaraguan, to contribute to finding the 
right road for Nicaragua." Ortega adds: "There is a serious 
problem here; it is the problem of trust. If there is no trust, 
if the EPS -- now that it has its code -- is not given an 
opportunity to demonstrate that it is truly a national army that 
does not answer to any partisan interests, then we will always 
live in a climate of insecurity and will continue living with 
instability." 
  In response to a question on whether he plans to return to 
the Sandinist ranks, Ortega says he will continue on the 
revolutionary road from a "very individualistic position." 
Ortega notes that since the Chamorro government took office, 
members of the EPS have not been members of the Sandinist 
political wing. He adds: "All of us who are members of the EPS 
are revolutionaries. Some radical Sandinists accuse us of being 
traitors." He continues: "These same people are launching a 
campaign that says the EPS cannot be trusted, because we do not 
answer to a party as in the past regime. I am against the EPS 
being under political leadership. This is very dangerous." 
  When the discussion turns to the relationship between the 
Army and the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN), Ortega 
warns if Sandinist leaders attempt to influence the Army, the 
Army will distance itself from them and a civil war among 
Sandinists will follow. Ortega adds: "At this time, the FSLN 
can be split into as many factions as it wants. The Army will 
not break up over or follow any Sandinist leader." 
  Asked about the risks posed to the nation by a division 
within the FSLN, Ortega says there have been extremists in the 
FSLN throughout his tenure as EPS commander. Some of these 
extremists have criticized the Army for failing to conform to 
their political position. He reiterates that the Army "should 
not follow anyone within the FSLN" but, rather, remain committed 
to the good of the Nicaraguan people. 
  Ortega goes on to note that the draft Military Organization 
Law is important because, although it is not perfect, it lays 
the groundwork for a national Army and the construction of a 
democratic system. 
  Next, Ortega denies having said in December that he had 
presidential aspirations, adding that he would consider such a 
possibility only at an appropriate time and under the right 
conditions. He adds: "My greatest aspiration is for Nicaragua 
to attain complete peace and to establish a course of stability 
leading to a more rapid reconstruction of the homeland. I think 
this is the most important thing. I would like to be part of a 
group of Nicaraguans who work to achieve this goal. I do not 
necessarily have to be the top leader of this effort and then be 
rewarded with a presidential candidacy. I am not looking 
forward to becoming a presidential candidate." 
  Espinosa then asks Ortega about the situation in northern 
Nicaragua, where the EPS continues to clash with armed groups 
linked to the recontras. Espinosa adds that the EPS is being 
accused of committing abuses in the north. Ortega says steps 
are being taken "to correct this situation," noting that the 
Army has a duty to continue fighting in the area to keep the 
armed groups in check. 
  Ortega continues by explaining he was originally named 
defense minister because he could contribute to a rapprochement 
between the executive branch and the Army. He adds: "I was then 
removed from the ministry because I was a Sandinist, as if being 
a Sandinist is tantamount to being evil. This did not help 
create the desired stability. As of now, unfortunately, there 
is no civilian who is politically qualified to occupy that post." 
  He says that talks are being held with institutes to train 
civilians from various political parties to assist in this task. 
  The interview continues with Ortega saying the defeat of the 
Somoza regime was the Sandinists' greatest success. He decries 
the fact that the Chamorro government was incapable of 
preserving the unity that prevailed after Somoza's defeat to 
rebuild the country. After stressing the fact that the country 
is indeed divided, Ortega says: "What is needed here is to 
secure a national unity solution in which every sector will be 
represented." 
  Ortega says that joint efforts must be made to reach a 
national agreement in order that the next administration's 
economic policy will not be so burdensome. He says a national 
dialogue must be promoted to find solutions as soon as possible. 
He says: "Sandinism, which is such an important sector of 
society, should seek an adequate program for the needs of the 
country, thinking of the interests of the country, instead of 
ideological or sectarian interests. This will encourage other 
sectors to do the same." 
  In discussing national unity further, Ortega says: "We 
Nicaraguans must realize it is necessary that we understand one 
another. Otherwise, the only path that will be left to us is to 
continue to kill one another and destroy one another. Not even 
the most fanatical individuals want this. I believe that not 
even those labeled the most fanatical extremists in a given 
party want war or more violence. They want more order and 
security. 
  "What is happening is that this feeling is growing as the 
election period draws near. Therefore, the approaching election 
apparently does not encourage the best conditions. In ideal 
conditions, as in a laboratory, for example, all of us -- Daniel 
Ortega, Arnoldo Aleman, Virgilio Godoy, conservatives, Social 
Christians, in short, everyone, including Pablo Antonio Cuadra 
and the cardinal -- would work toward rapprochement. This is 
the least common denominator needed to prevent the destruction 
of this country." 
  When asked about constitutional reform, Ortega says: "We 
must make the adjustments by reforming the Constitution. 
Therefore, a constitutional reform obliges us all to have the 
laws and instruments, so that, whether or not we like it, the 
police and the Army will ensure compliance with the laws. More 
important is that we appeal to the conscience of the people to 
secure such an agreement. I think this is what is important, to 
reach an agreement and to find solutions." 
  Ortega concludes with a final message: "Despite all of the 
complexities, Nicaraguans over the past 20 years have at least 
demonstrated that they have more virtues than defects. I think 
we Nicaraguans have the duty to tell all Nicaraguans before the 
end of this century that we are capable of working together to 
reconstruct the nation."

<F P=106> [Report by Claudia Moreira from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] The federal Senate has approved the amendments to 
the Tlatelolco Treaty, which guarantees the nonuse of nuclear 
weapons. This was reported by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. 
  [Begin Amorim recording] The treaty represents our total 
integration in a system of guarantees proscribing the use of 
nuclear weapons. It is a treaty that includes all of Latin 
America and the Caribbean. All the meaningful countries ratified 
it, except for Cuba, which did not sign it. However, I believe 
that now with this ratification by Brazil, as well as by 
Argentina and Chile-- which were the countries that promoted the 
amendments--Cuba will now sign it. 
  With this, Latin America and the Caribbean will be an area 
totally free of nuclear weapons. It must be pointed out that the 
treaty not only entails a commitment by Latin America but by the 
nuclear powers as well not to use or keep nuclear weapons in 
Latin America. [end recording] 
  The Tlatelolco Treaty also allows the control of nuclear 
installations by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

  [Text] President Alberto Fujimori held a 45-minute meeting 
with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu in Government 
House today. After the private protocol meeting, President 
Fujimori gave a news conference to Romanian reporters. This is 
part of the news conference. [passage indistinct] 
  The news conference given by the president to the Romanian

foreign debt. President Fujimori also said the Romanian 
official's visit will help develop electric energy in Peru. He 
added that Romania has long experience in electrical power, 
especially hydroelectric and thermoelecric plants. Fujimori said 
that in the last five years important steps have been taken for 
Andean integration, although he noted there are still barriers 
that can be overcome united. This is part of the news conference 
given by President Fujimori to the Romanian reporters who are 
part of the delegation headed by Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu.

  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani confirmed yesterday that 
the negotiations for a free trade agreement between Mexico and 
three Central American countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El 
Salvador -- have gained "great momentum," particularly in our 
nation. 
  The president said the treaty negotiations with Mexico are 
going well: "I believe that the negotiations have advanced 
considerably." Cristiani stressed that negotiations for the 
trade agreement are not being carried out bilaterally between El 
Salvador and Mexico, but also include Guatemala and Honduras. 
"There is willingness by the Guatemalan, Honduran, and 
Salvadoran Governments to establish the mechanisms to conclude 
the treaty with Mexico as soon as possible," he said. 
  The Salvadoran president explained that the free trade 
agreement (FTA) with Mexico is on course, and that proof of this 
is the creation of 12 work groups to give simultaneous 
consideration to different FTA issues. In addition, 
President-elect Armando Calderon Sol announced on Thursday that 
the agreement with Mexico would be signed at year's end, a 
statement that prompted reactions from the country's business 
sector. 
  For businessman Pablo Tesak, the date given for 
implementation of the FTA is "impossible" to meet because 
Salvadoran private enterprise must modernize "a lot" to be able 
to compete with Mexican industry. 
  Regarding this issue, President Cristiani said there is no 
problem in complying with the date set for the signing of the 
trade agreements: "perhaps the difficulty lies in the Salvadoran 
businessmen's participation." According to president Cristiani 
the businessmen's participation is fundamental to the efficient 
operation of a trade agreement of this nature, "because the 
businessmen will provide the dynamics needed for the proper 
development and operation of the trade agreement." The 
president said the role of the government is to create the 
operational framework to set up the economic agreement, the rest 
is up to the nation's productive sector. 
  Meanwhile, the Corporation of Exporters of El Salvador 
(Coexport) points out in a communique that the conversations on 
the possible signing of a trade agreement between Mexico and 
Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, "should not be conducted 
in haste." Coexport asks the government to be "cautious" during 
negotiations for a new trade agreement with Mexico, because the 
latter has experience in this area as a result of NAFTA.

  [Text] President-elect Armando Calderon Sol, upon his 
return yesterday from Mexico City, confirmed that the government 
will sign a free trade agreement with Mexico before the end of 
the year. 
  Calderon Sol, who will assume the presidency on 1 June, said 
that "if negotiations continue at their current rate," the 
treaty could be signed before the end of President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's term, set for 1 December. 
  The president-elect met with several ministers and local 
business representatives during his visit to Mexico. The 
purpose was to measure the degree of interest in investments in 
El Salvador. He said this was only possible "thanks to the 
stability of the democratic system and the peace process, which 
have given the county prestige." 
  In statements to the Mexican press, Calderon Sol expressed 
his willingness to establish a common market, since this would 
open operations to 120 million consumers, 30 million of which 
are in the Central American isthmus. 
  If no agreement is signed during President Salinas de 
Gortari's mandate, talks would continue with the new president 
to be elected on 21 August. The new Salvadoran president said 
that signing a free trade agreement with Mexico would be the 
first step toward reaching a similar agreement with the United 
States. 
  On 23 May Calderon Sol will fly to Washington to meet Vice 
President Al Gore, who will host a summit meeting several days 
later to discuss NAFTA with all of the Central American 
presidents. In commenting on his scheduled trip to UN 
headquarters in New York, the president-elect said he had "no 
concerns at all about addressing any topic with the secretary 
general." He was referring to statements made by Chief Justice 
Mauricio Gutierrez Castro, of the Supreme Court of Justice, 
during the opening session of the Legislative Assembly. 
  He explained the purpose of his trip was to express the 
political will to fully comply with the peace agreements and to 
request aid from the United Nations, through agencies such as 
UNICEF, FAO, and the WHO. He said that, belonging to this 
international forum, El Salvador has a right to the programs 
these agencies offer. Therefore, it can request such aid "with 
dignity and authority."

  [Excerpts] The atmosphere at Carabineros headquarters is 
now relatively calm. A discreet police patrol was established 
after General Rodolfo Stange returned to work this morning. 
[passage omitted] 
  By 0800 everything was ready to receive Gen. Stange who 
arrived at 0807 and was welcomed by General Fernando Cordero, 
General Manuel Ugarte, and General Oscar Tapia. Before entering 
the building Stange greeted the media. 
  After 0900 Carabineros issued a brief communique stating 
that 
Gen. Stange, having taken the vacations to which he is entitled 
by law, has resumed his activities. 
  [Begin recording] [Carabineros Social Communications 
Director 
Major Camilo Salinas] Complying with Defense Minister Edmundo 
Perez Yoma's orders, within the next few days the Carabineros 
High Command will focus its attention on drafting a 
modernization plan for the institution. [end recording] 
  Carabineros sources have said this means Gen. Stange will 
not 
delegate his command nor his decision-making role, only minor 
tasks such as inspection visits and ceremonies. [passage omitted] 
  Defense Minister Perez Yoma said the government is satisfied 
with the solution to the Stange case. He explained that while 
Gen. Stange is busy studying the modernization plan, his other 
duties will be discharged by Gen. Fernando Cordero, the second 
in command. 
  After yesterday's hectic day, which ended with a brief 
communique on the solution to the Stange case, the defense 
minister explained the scope of this agreement. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez Yoma] I believe this agreement, to 
a 
certain degree, safeguards the interest of both parties. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Does this merely postpone the issues 
for another 30 days or is the problem definitely solved? 
  [Perez Yoma] It by no means postpones the problem. It is the 
solution to a determined problem and we will assess the 
developments day by day. 
  [Reporter] In 30 days time will he [Stange] leave the 
institution definitely or will he fully resume his duties? 
  [Perez Yoma] There is nothing definite yet on the subject 
and 
we agreed we would not discuss the problem. I think we must let 
things take their course, we are right on top of the problem, 
and the best course is to let things return to normal, let calm 
return, and keep in permanent contact with Gen. Stange and 
assess the development of events. 
  [Reporter] This means Gen. Cordero will assume these duties 
in his capacity as acting director general. 
  [Perez Yoma] Naturally, he is the second in command. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with National Renewal President Andres Allamand </F>
by Aida Hanania in Santiago on 31 March; first two paragraphs 
are author's introduction] 
  [Text] No doubt it was not a time for political analysis at 
the big, rambling house of Antonio Varas when evening fell on 31 
March. The Holy Week holidays had come early, even to the 
headquarters of Renovacion Nacional [RN-National Renewal]. At 
that time only one office was still lit up in the almost 
deserted building. It was the office of Andres Allamand, the 
leader of the party, who was receiving an unending series of 
telephone calls regarding the verdict in the case of the people 
who were beheaded. Obviously, the subject drew the intermittent 
attention of the opposition leader, and this matter also must 
have been mentioned in the discussions which Allamand had this 
weekend with Roberto Ossandon, the secretary general of his 
party. Ossandon promised to go with Allamand on his daily 
morning run. 
  On the other hand, the differences with the UDI [Independent 
Democratic Union] on opposition strategy toward the present 
government do not seem to bother Allamand, who considers that 
the democratic attitude displayed during the Aylwin 
administration was positive and extremely important. Nor does 
the president of the RN feel that his leadership has been 
challenged. He analyzed the present and future of his party with 
undisguised optimism, while displaying caution about 
controversial subjects. 
  [Hanania] Are you uncomfortable about having been elected a 
deputy in Las Condes with votes "borrowed" from Concertacion? 
  [Allamand] On the contrary. I feel that this increases my 
responsibility as a member of Parliament, since I feel to some 
extent under an obligation to respond to a broader electorate 
than usual. I am aware that some of the people who voted for me 
are identified with the opposition and some of them support the 
government. 
  [Hanania] Nevertheless, do you accept that those votes saved 
you from a defeat by Carlos Bombal, which, in the view of 
leaders of your own party, would have been humiliating? 
  [Allamand] I think that when you go into an election, you 
have to accept the results. And, whether you win or lose, it is 
not humiliating in any case. 
  [Hanania] But the election in District 23 was not an 
ordinary 
one. It was no mystery to anyone that in your district the 
future of two different leadership styles of the right was at 
stake. One of them--your own--was more open. The other, 
representing a harder line, was that of Carlos Bombal. In view 
of the results, how do you interpret the present status of those 
two leadership styles? 
  [Allamand] I think that both of them survived. 
  [Hanania] Does that mean that there are two leaders of the 
right? 
  [Allamand] I would not put it in personal terms. I believe 
that in the center-right there are positions which continue to 
exist, side by side. They are similar but are not exactly 
symmetrical--nor are they identical. 
  [Hanania] Does the fact that Bombal received more votes than 
you did mean that he reduced your status as leader in the RN? 
  [Allamand] (Smiling). Not at all. Anyone who knows the 
particularly difficult conditions under which I became a 
candidate knows that when I obtained the results I did, this was 
a great success. I am not unaware, nor do I ignore the fact that 
in reality Carlos Bombal received a slightly larger number of 
votes. However, the votes which we both obtained are equally 
significant. 
  [Hanania] Then your leadership was not affected? 
  [Allamand] The subject of the leadership is a question for 
the longer term. I do not think that it is determined by a given 
election. It is no mystery to anyone that if there was an 
electoral district in Chile in which the nomination of an RN 
candidate was particularly complex, it was Las Condes. But I am 
sure that it was a great campaign and that the result left all 
of us fully satisfied. This matter of the kind of leadership 
label you have does not particularly concern me. Why talk about 
possible conflicts over the leadership which may arise? In 
politics you have to work to promote the things you believe in. 
For example, the latest Adimark Poll shows an extraordinarily 
positive result for me, personally--by far the best which I have 
had over the past few years. 
  [Hanania] But Roberto Mendez, the Adimark pollster, has 
pointed out that the data in that study show a lack of 
leadership in the opposition today. 
  [Allamand] I do not think that is true. Quite the contrary. 
I 
do not like to talk about myself, but that poll clearly showed 
me as the strongest opposition leader, a long way ahead of the 
others. Among the 15 leading political personalities there are 
only two from the opposition. I am in eighth place on this list, 
and Carlos Bombal is 15th. In any case I do not think that this 
list is very important. 
  [Hanania] At the beginning of March 1994 you pointed out 
that 
the first task facing you was organizing your party. Do you 
intend to run for a third term in office as president of the RN? 
  [Allamand] The party has left behind it a crisis situation 
and a lack of internal harmony which has damaged our political 
activity since 1992, with the fateful espionage episode. Now in 
the RN we are moving with a new kind of cohesion and harmony and 
with a desire to work together. I am very satisfied about the 
path which the party has followed over the past few months. 
However, I have not yet decided whether or not I will run for a 
new term as president of the party. That is a matter on which 
there is still time to make a decision. 
  [Hanania] According to what has happened in the past few 
days, there are now several people who are considering replacing 
you, including those who would continue with the same political 
line, such as Deputy Teodoro Ribera, and representatives of the 
more "Jarpista" group [conservative faction formerly led by 
Jarpa], such as Senator Sergio Romero. 
  [Allamand] I think that there are various persons who might 
take part in an eventual contest for the party leadership. Now 
what I do not believe is that such markedly different views are 
being expressed as are reflected in your question. My impression 
is that the party now has great cohesion. Furthermore, I am not 
sure whether those two people you mentioned would be satisfied 
with being identified with one tendency or another. 
  [Hanania] In view of the position which such a well-known 
follower of the conservative line as Deputy Alberto Cardemil has 
been establishing within the RN, are you not concerned that this 
conservative position could again become dominant in all its 
glory and majesty, but now without Jarpa? 
  [Allamand] (Laughing). On the contrary. The task of the 
president of the party is specifically to try to harmonize the 
various views of the future. 
  [Hanania] Will that kind of harmony require the end of the 
"Jarpista" [conservative] tendency? 
  [Allamand] Please, who is interested in that? You make me 
laugh. It is simply absurd to talk about the end of the Jarpa 
tendency, given the present, internal situation in the RN. 
Nobody is now working within the party in a kind of competition 
for certain positions, and, even less, to develop new factions 
within the party. This is a party which is fed up with factions, 
many of which arose more because of personal problems than 
anything else. I visualize a situation from now on of much 
greater cohesion and harmony. I think it is very good for a 
large party like this one, which also had several candidates for 
the Presidency of the Senate, to have a number of possible 
candidates for the presidency of the party. 
<H5>  Opposition Alliance </H5>
  [Hanania] Although the RN and the UDI have agreed on the 
objective of having the "Union por Chile" [Union for Chile] 
presented as a valid alternative government for the 1999 
elections, once again the two parties differ on the tactics to 
be followed to reach that objective. While the RN continues to 
hold to the idea of keeping in effect a democracy based on 
agreements, the UDI is tending toward a democracy based on 
alternatives. 
  [Allamand] This difference between the "democracy of the 
agreements" and the "democracy of the alternatives" is much more 
apparent than real, since, among other things, it must not be 
forgotten that we developed both concepts during the previous 
government. In a modern democracy positive differences, that is, 
alternatives, must coexist. We must have enough intelligence to 
generate points of convergence, that is, agreements. 
  [Hanania] Nevertheless, some of your associates consider 
that 
once the transition is over, the policy of agreements will no 
longer be justified. 
  [Allamand] We must not return to confrontation in Chilean 
politics simply because the transition to democracy has been 
completed. I believe that there is an enormous amount of 
political immaturity in those who allege that they wish to have 
nothing more to do with one of the greatest "intangibles" which 
the country has as a whole, that is, the climate of political 
harmony and social peace. 
  [Hanania] Some UDI leaders consider that a policy of that 
kind will delay the possibility for the opposition to become a 
real, alternative government, because such a policy blurs the 
differences. 
  [Allamand] I believe, quite to the contrary, that such a 
policy would bring the differences out more clearly and 
strengthen them because such a policy would show unmistakably to 
the country that the opposition has ideas and the capacity 
really to have an impact on national leadership and, 
consequently, to be the government. In a democracy you govern 
from the side of the government, but also from the opposition. 
And if they ask me how you move more quickly by being an 
alternative government, in my view it is not by waiting for six 
years to propose a list of actions to be taken which you have 
kept up your sleeve but rather through the consistent and 
continuing action of providing solutions to national problems. 
  [Hanania] Do you think that the position of the UDI reflects 
a certain meanness of spirit by concentrating on outlining the 
right rather than emphasizing the interests of the country? 
  [Allamand] I would not put it in such harsh terms. That is a 
kind of a caricature of the situation. All of a sudden the forms 
seem to be harsher than the substance. The question now is 
whether, during the Frei administration, the opposition should 
lend its active cooperation to accomplishing major, national 
tasks or, on the contrary, to stand by its own positions and 
simply act as spectators. I believe that the proper way to 
behave when you are in the opposition is by cooperating actively 
in carrying out the national tasks which face governments. I 
hope that, finally, the UDI will also work along the line that 
you have to serve the permanent interests of the country, 
whether in the government or in the opposition. 
  [Hanania] Nevertheless, many people, including some within 
the government itself, think that the RN will wind up adopting 
the views of the UDI, just as, for example, it wound up 
accepting the incorporation of the UCC [Center-Center Union] in 
the right-wing agreement. 
  [Allamand] In effect we accepted the incorporation of the 
UCC 
since, had we rejected it, it would have been impossible to 
prepare a list of candidates for the Senate. In that event, this 
list achieved great success. The basic discussion was always 
about how the UCC was to be incorporated. It should not be 
forgotten that the UCC began by asking for 15 districts in which 
it would stand on its own. But at this point that sounds to me 
like an argument from the past. 
  [Hanania] My question, Deputy Allamand, was whether you 
rejected the possibility that the RN would also end up accepting 
at this point the view of the UDI by hardening its position 
against the government. 
  [Allamand] You are working on the basis of the view that the 
UDI imposes its point of view, which, objectively speaking, is 
not true. During the whole period of the previous administration 
the RN was consistent and coherent in implementing a policy of 
agreements from the first to the last day. And, simultaneously, 
we set out conditions for entering into electoral alliances, 
both in the election of 1992 as well as in the election of 1993. 
I hope that in this new stage of greater harmony we may act 
jointly. We have a certain policy. Of course, we are interested 
in having a united, opposition policy. 
  [Hanania] If you find that the results of the policy of 
agreements followed during the Aylwin administration was so 
satisfactory, why do you think that the UDI would wish to change 
it? 
  [Allamand] Those who think that the opposition behaved badly 
during the Aylwin government are blind. We increased our 
parliamentary representation both in the Senate as well as in 
the Chamber of Deputies. We consolidated our electoral support 
and increased our vote. 
  [Hanania] Do the differences which appear today between the 
RN and the UDI relate to the way the right might handle the 
power which it obtained in the Senate? 
  [Allamand] At a time when the center-right has experienced 
its greatest cohesion and unity over the past five years, it is 
almost absurd to be concerned about such differences as exist. 
There are many more points of agreement than in previous 
periods. Now, each party has its own identity. The UCC has its 
identity, the UDI has its own, and we have our own. 
  [Hanania] And is the UCC playing the role of moderator? 
  [Allamand] Within the coalition no one is playing the role 
of 
umpire or moderator. Each party presents its points of view, 
things are discussed, and so far there has been enough agreement 
to act together. 
  [Hanania] Do you believe that the unity which the right has 
achieved will be really stable? 
  [Allamand] I think that the worst part of this difficult 
process is behind us and that today we have a positive stage in 
front of us. During the previous administration the differences 
between the RN and the UDI were understandable, to a certain 
extent, because the agreement which we had regarding what we had 
to do as an opposition was different. We contributed to reforms 
which I consider key factors in the present, forward looking 
situation in which Chile finds itself. These included tax and 
labor reforms, without which I am sure that the previous 
government would not have had the prevailing social peace 
between labor and management. The UDI had a different view. 
However, today we have a significant, united position. 
  [Hanania] Speaking of reforms, what progress has been made 
in 
the conversations which you have been having with the new 
government in dealing with pending constitutional reforms? 
  [Allamand] In terms of constitutional reforms, there is a 
"critical mass" in support of moving forward quickly to increase 
the investigatory powers of Congress and to strengthen municipal 
governments, including the direct election of mayors. There are 
other matters on which spontaneous agreement has also emerged, 
such as, for example, the need to deal with the possibility of a 
vacancy in the office of president. I have proposed that perhaps 
this is a good time to see if we can reach an agreement which 
would make it possible to return to synchronizing elections. 
Today there is major confusion, and we have an intermittent 
sequence of elections. There are other subjects, such as that of 
the appointed senators, the impossibility of removing the 
commanders in chief of the armed forces from office, the matter 
of the National Security Council, the composition of the 
Constitutional Tribunal, and the electoral system itself, on 
which, as of this point, agreements are not in sight. 
  [Hanania] Do the constitutional reforms also involve the 
conversations going on with the PS [Socialist Party]? 
  [Allamand] I have the greatest respect and political regard 
for Camilo Escalona, and that helps us to carry on a continuing 
conversation between socialists and members of the RN in 
analyzing different political, economic, social, and 
constitutional subjects. It is a positive sign for us to have 
direct conversations which, furthermore, are appropriate for any 
mature and healthy democracy. To some extent we have disposed of 
the idea that the democratic center-right and the democratic 
left have to go through a kind of customs examination presided 
over by the DC [Christian Democracy party]. That relates to a 
past phase of Chilean democracy.

<F P=106> [Letter from Colombian Liberal Party presidential candidate </F>
Ernesto Samper Pizano to Dario Arizmendi, news director of 
Caracol Network on the cancellation of the scheduled 
presidential debate; date of letter not given] 
  [Text] Dear Dario: Last week, Conservative Party 
presidential candidate Andres Pastrana sent a message to the 
media in which he tried to schedule a program of debates 
specifying the topics, participants, and hours of the debates 
among the presidential and vice presidential candidates. Within 
this timeframe, a debate was scheduled for tomorrow in Cadena 
Caracol studios on the topic of farming. 
  Subsequently, Dr. Pastrana sent a message expressing his 
refusal to participate in the debate proposed by himself. I 
deplore the situation created by this inconsistency, which has 
occurred previously in responses by Dr. Pastrana to other media 
proposals. 
  Consequently, I believe that none of the meetings proposed 
for tomorrow in Caracol studios will be held. This, however, 
does not preclude their being rescheduled in the future. Please 
receive a cordial greeting. 
  [signed] Ernesto Samper Pizano.

<F P=106> [From the "Midday Television Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The Constitutional Court today upheld the ruling on 
personal drug consumption. The ruling will not affect the 
sentences of those who store, produce, manufacture, distribute, 
or are linked on any other way to drug trafficking activities. 
Fernando Ramos has the story: 
  [Begin recording] [Ramos] As for the ruling that authorized 
possession of drugs for personal use, the Constitutional Court 
emphasized we cannot think of repression as the only mechanism 
to solve this problem. In several of the ruling's paragraphs, 
the Constitutional Court insisted it ruled according to what the 
Constitution and the laws stipulate. 
  [Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango] This is 
nothing 
uncommon; it complies with the duties of the Constitutional 
Court. As for the consumption of potentially toxic substances 
such as alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, we count on education, 
which is part of the ruling. 
  [Ramos] The ruling also stipulates that the National 
Congress 
will be able to legislate to find measures to control drug 
consumption. 
  [Constitutional Court Magistrate Vladimiro Naranjo] Within 
the Legislative Branch, the National Congress is free to take 
the initiative in this field. There are no reasons why the 
Constitutional Court has to set some standards; this is a 
legislative initiative. 
  [Ramos] The four dissenting votes were also submitted to the 
Constitutional Court Secretariat General. The reasons some 
magistrates voted against the legalization of drugs for personal 
use are explained in those documents. 
  [Constitutional Court Magistrate Hernando Herrera] I believe 
the right to free personality development cannot overstep the 
rights of society, family, youth, children, and women, because 
our Constitution stipulates the prevalence of general interest 
over individual rights. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Edwin Fernandez: "Puyo--Focus of Dialogue"] </F>
  [Text] Puyo--The dialogue between the government and the 
leaders of the Indian organizations in the Amazon region 
concerning the oil activity being pursued in the region has 
begun in Puyo. 
  At the first meeting, to which the authorities and 
representatives of the Indian and peasant organizations were 
invited on the initiative of Minister of Energy Francisco 
Acosta, attendance exceeded all expectations. 
  The meeting was described as "historic." This was the first 
time in more than two decades of oil operations in the Amazon 
region that the government has invited representatives of the 
people who are feeling the impact of this activity to 
participate in discussions. 
  The unprecedented number of persons present at this forum 
included tenant farmers, Quichuas, Achuars, Shuars, and 
Huaoranis, all speaking the same language and evidencing the 
national spirit characteristic of all the citizens of Ecuador. 
  This occasion also gave Minister Acosta an opportunity to 
explain the scope of the seventh round of bidding for the right 
to prospect for and exploit oil in this country. 
  Nine blocks of up to 200,000 hectares in area located in the 
Provinces of Sucumbios, Napo, Pastaza, and Morona Santiago in 
the Amazon region are involved in this process. 
  In the course of the bidding process, norms designed to 
ensure strict preservation and protection of the ecosystems and 
biodiversity in the region, as well as the cultural identities 
of the Indian peoples, have been established. 
  Acosta assured those present that the government will 
require 
the companies to complete environmental rehabilitation or to pay 
compensation if environmental damage has been done. 
  Although he did not refer to it directly, the minister 
dismissed the possibility of a moratorium suggested by several 
Indian organizations for a period of 15 years before proceeding 
with the round that has already been announced. "Oil production 
accounts for 50 percent of the state budget and 46 percent of 
Ecuador's foreign-exchange income. And so our country is 
dependent on the extraction of oil. 
  "As a government official and a minister, I cannot avoid my 
responsibility to the history of the country by failing to carry 
forward the oil prospecting needed to find new reserves." 
  With a view to the drafting of an overall plan for 
environmental management and subsequent supervision of it, the 
Ministry of Energy has decided, on the basis of an agreement 
with various Indian organizations, to establish a 
Socio-Environmental Monitoring Commission. 
  It will be enacted into law by means of a ministerial 
resolution. The commission will be made up of the minister of 
energy and a representative of the PETROECUADOR [Ecuadorian 
State Petroleum Enterprise], the prefects in the Amazon region, 
municipalities, Indian organizations, and ecological groups. 
  Following the address by Minister Acosta, representatives of 
the Indians and the peasants, one after another, set forth their 
positions concerning the hydrocarbon activity. 
  Despite the differences among the organizations, their 
representatives agreed that to date, the oil operations have not 
contributed to the development of the Amazon region. 
  They reiterated that the settlements located near the oil 
wells remain without such basic projects and facilities as 
environmental protection, health infrastructure, 
electrification, telecommunications, and roadways. 
  The wealth taken out of the bowels of the earth in the 
Amazon 
region has served to finance the execution of projects in the 
country's large cities exclusively, the indignant 
representatives pointed out. 
  They categorically rejected the suggestion that the 
Monitoring Commission include only a single interlocutor 
representing the Indian organizations. 
  They suggested that one person be appointed to represent 
each 
block. 
  The minister said that these and other suggestions will be 
analyzed carefully before a response is provided, which might 
occur at the next scheduled meeting, in April. 
  Acosta expressed satisfaction with the results achieved and 
the information obtained. "The responses show that the people 
accept the seventh round and the efforts of the government to 
safeguard the environment in this vulnerable and fragile region."

  [Text] Following an appeal by various Indian, trade union, 
and student groups to bring the country to a standstill, the 
government is expecting a restless week of protests by the 
people--probably with clashes between the demonstrators and the 
police. 
  Indian leaders warned Sixto Duran-Ballen that if Congress 
does not reject a draft agrarian law they consider harmful, they 
will close highways and isolate the capital. Luis Macas, 
president of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of 
Ecuador, said that if this law is approved, Indians will fall 
back into the times of slavery. Our land would be taken away 
from us, and we would be unable to produce, he added. 
  Macas said that the law jeopardizes the Indians' ability to 
obtain food in the country, as it extends the landholders' 
controls over agricultural projects with the sole purpose of 
producing for export. Another Indian leader explained that the 
draft law seeks to eliminate the agrarian reform, which would 
deprive the Indian communities of their land.

  [Text] A total of 23 political parties have been legally

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Aponte, a correspondent in Tingo Maria] </F>
  [Text] Interior Ministry intelligence analysts estimated 
the fortune amassed by Oscar Alberto Ramirez, aka "President 
Feliciano," at $200 million through kickbacks paid by gangs of 
drug traffickers operating in the area known as the coca belt 
region, which is located along the jungle. 
  According to these analysts, who are conducting an 
investigation in the region, Ramirez started to collect this 
money--which accounts for one-third of the total flow moved 
through the marketing of cocaine paste in the region under 
Shining Path [SL] control; that is, $600 million--a few months 
before the arrest of Abimael Guzman. 
  Ramirez managed to do this despite the fact that the SL has 
lost control of major drug centers such as Crespo, Castillo, 
Pueblo Nuevo, Pacayacu, Loro, and recently--as a result of 
Operation "Aries"--Mohena, Moyuna, Venenillo, Mongon, and 
Ancayacu, among others. 
  By contrast, cassava, rice, corn, and other legal crops have 
yielded only $30 million. 
  Through disclosures made by repentant drug traffickers at 
the 
303d Battalion on the Huallaga Front, it has been learned that 
"Feliciano," "El Manco," and other SL leaders who deal with the 
drug traffickers have permanent ground-air contact through 
powerful receivers, portable transmitters, and using coded 
messages. 
  Huallaga Front strategists believe Operation "Aries" 
prompted 
the suspension of flights by Colombian planes in the Leoncio 
Prado (Huanuco) and Padre Abad (Ucayali) areas. 
  Despite the information obtained by counterintelligence 
agents from repented former SL leaders and peasants forced to 
work for the SL for some time, there is no firm clue as to the 
place where the fortune Ramirez amassed by exacting kickbacks 
from drug traffickers is hidden. 
  There is evidence, however, that drug traffickers and SL 
members circulate large amounts of dollars through local 
branches of banks and financial companies. The fact is that not 
all the proceeds from drug sales are "laundered" in Lima by 
individual money exchangers or through investments in legally 
constituted companies. 
  There are several financial companies competing for 
narcodollars along the coca belt region. According to 
intelligence sources, no one should be surprised if "Feliciano" 
made large deposits through a front, if he is keeping a major 
portion of the money, or he distributed it through his closest 
aides and henchmen. 
  The truth is that the money is concentrated in few hands 
because those terrorists who are clashing with security 
forces--the ones called the "rank-and-file"--are poorly fed, 
dressed in rags, and suffering from contagious diseases such as 
scabies, tuberculosis, and cholera. 
  Some repented SL leaders who were recently captured admitted 
that most of those now following "El Manco" have absolutely no 
morale, that they are following him out of fear for their 
families who have been kidnapped by the SL, which has threatened 
to murder them. 
  It has been reported that drug shipments have been suspended 
after the dismantling of the so-called "Red Sea" battalion and 
as a result of the capture and/or surrender of many subversives 
and the action of antisubversive forces at the Ucayali Navy base. 
  Based on information obtained in the region, it has been 
ascertained that each shipment consisted of 300 or 500 kg of 
basic cocaine paste, depending on whether the carrier was a 
single-engine or twin-engine plane, respectively. 
  DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] agents said that basic 
cocaine paste produced in the coca belt is transported to large 
refinery laboratories located in the Amazon Trapeze jungle (an 
area located between Brazil, Colombia, and Peru) where, after 
being processed into cocaine hydrochloride, it is shipped to the 
United States and Europe.

after a clash with its crew members. The airplane crashed in the 
crew's effort to escape. 
  According to a Huallaga Front Political Command communique, 
the clash occurred at an illegal airfield in the San Pablo 
district, San Martin Department. The airplane crew members 
escaped but the patrol found 124 kg of cocaine base inside the 
airplane.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 16 May (AFP) -- In the general 
elections held on Monday, after the Central Vote-Counting Board 
[JCE] had counted 46.14 percent of the votes, President Joaquin 
Balaguer led with 43.40 percent of the vote, while social 
democratic opposition candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez had 
received 40.47 percent of the vote. The official report is 
based on 1,645,179 votes cast, 1,557,712 of which were declared 
valid. 
  These figures reportedly guarantee Balaguer's assumption of 
office as president, for the seventh time, of this country of 7 
million people. 
  The election results, nevertheless, were challenged by Pena 
Gomez on Tuesday. The opposition candidate reported a "blatant 
fraud" perpetrated by the JCE, which reportedly had left some 
200,000 voters out of the lists. 
  Also participating in the race for the presidency are the 
Party of the Dominican Liberation of former president Juan 
Bosch, the Independent Revolutionary Party [PRI], and the Unity 
Independent Movement-New Power party. The following results 
are based on 46.14 percent of the counted votes.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 17 May (NOTIMEX) -- Social democratic 
presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez today demanded 
that the OAS investigate his allegations of fraud in the 
Dominican elections. 
  Pena Gomez, who was nominated by the Dominican Revolutionary 
Party [PRD], demanded that the elections be annulled in several 
provinces, claiming that some 200,000 voters were unable to vote 
because their names did not appear at the voting tables. Pena 
Gomez added that such irregularities constitute "major fraud" 
and asked his followers to remain alert because he believes "a 
serious attempt against democracy is under way." "These 
incidents are very serious, and the elections should be held 
again in those cities and provinces where the irregularities 
took place," Pena Gomez indicated. 
  Pena Gomez accused the Central Electoral Board [JCE] of 
excluding some 200,000 opposition supporters from the voter 
registration list to guarantee the reelection of President 
Joaquin Balaguer, candidate for the Social Christian Reformist 
Party. He stated that he will challenge the electoral results 
before the relevant authorities and demand new elections and the 
presence of international observers during the vote count. "We 
will also ask the OAS to investigate the event," he added. 
  PRD sources agreed that if Pena's request is admitted, 
elections will be held again in nearly 40 percent of Dominican 
territory. 
  This morning the JCE revealed that after counting 34.92 
percent of the votes, Balaguer had obtained 43.64 percent and 
Pena Gomez 41.03. 
  Pena Gomez claimed that Balaguer's followers decided to 
suspend the vote count in Santo Domingo -- where nearly 30 
percent of all voters live -- "because they know they are losing 
here." The PRD candidate said there was fraud in Santo Domingo 
and some provinces in the country's interior, particularly in an 
area inhabited by black Dominicans who work in some 20 sugar 
mills. 
  President Balaguer downplayed an eventual challenge of the 
election results, saying that "everyone will be satisfied with 
the way in which this electoral process has unfolded." 
  According to foreign journalists, the situation in the 
country is unstable. Three trucks carrying armed policemen have 
been deployed around PRD headquarters. 
  Dominicans went to the polls yesterday to elect a new 
president, vice president, 120 deputies, 30 senators, and 105 
mayors.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 17 May (DPA) -- Dominican soldiers 
and policemen intensified today their surveillance around the 
poor neighborhoods that surround the capital and began searching 
vehicles for weapons. Soldiers and policemen, including special 
riot police forces, were posted at key points of the capital, 
especially in the neighborhoods where protests and violent 
demonstrations generally start. It was reported that the 
military occupation of the capital was ordered to prevent 
disorder and possible acts of violence. 
  The tension continues to increase in the Dominican capital, 
while reports on the election results are slowly being disclosed 
and charges of fraud by the opposition Dominican Revolutionary 
Party (PRD) increase. 
  Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential candidate for the 
PRD, announced today he will ask for the annulment of the 
election results in the provinces where fraud is proven and 
reiterated his charges that the voter lists were altered to 
prevent members of his party and other opposition organizations 
from voting. 
  This afternoon another PRD leader accused the Central 
Electoral Board (JCE) of providing the country with incorrect 
information on election results. Manuel Esquea Guerrero, PRD 
delegate before the JCE, said the figures provided in official 
bulletins do not correspond to the figures provided to the 
parties on "diskettes," which should be the same figures 
provided to the public. 
  The country was partially paralyzed today. Government 
offices were not open, and many businesses remained closed. The 
schools that were used as voting centers yesterday did not open 
today either, and the flow of vehicles, both private and mass 
transit, was minimal. 
  The latest results provided by the JCE show an increase in 
Joaquin Balaguer's lead. With 61 percent of the voting tables 
counted, Balaguer has 786,559 votes or 43.53 percent. 
Opposition candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez has 730,775 
votes or 40.44 percent of the votes.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 17 May (DPA) -- President Joaquin 
Balaguer and his Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) remain 
in the lead in the vote count for the presidency, with 66.5 
percent of voting tables counted. 
  According to the latest bulletin issued by the Central 
Electoral Council (JCE), Balaguer and his running mate, Jacinto 
Peynado, had approximately 844,639 votes or 43 percent. His 
closest rival, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, who is seeking the 
presidency on the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) ticket, 
had a total of 788,134 votes or 40 percent. 
  Former President Juan Bosch and running mate Lionel 
Fernandez 
remain in a distant third place with 255,164 votes or 13 percent 
of the votes counted. Fourth place is occupied by Jacobo 
Majluta with 43,633 votes, 2.0 percent of the votes counted. 
  The PRD Political Commission will meet tonight to debate the 
actions to be taken regarding the charges of alleged fraud in 
the electoral process. This organization asserts that through 
the manipulation of the electoral lists, thousands of their 
followers were not allowed to exert their right to vote. 
  Meanwhile, the capital city of Dominican Republic remains 
militarized and surveillance has been increased at key points. 
The police and soldiers search vehicles that move close to the 
JCE headquarters and that arrive in Santo Domingo from cities in 
the interior. The search, it has been reported, is for weapons, 
which will be confiscated if found. 
  The situation continues to be one of tense tranquility and 
people await the final results of the electoral process.

<F P=106> [Report by journalist Jean Luckenson on ceremony to install </F>
Jonassaint cabinet held at the National Palace in Port-au-Prince 
on 16 May; passages within italics in Creole -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Emile Jonassaint installed a new 
12-member government on 16 May, less than 2 hours after his 
first presidential decree appointing the main members of the 
ministerial cabinet. The ceremony took place in the diplomatic 
lounge of the National Palace. Jean Luckenson reports: 
  [Luckenson] The big rendezvous on the afternoon of 
Monday, 16 May, a few minutes before 1600 was at the diplomatic 
lounge of the National Palace where attorney Emile Jonassaint, 
provisional president of the Republic, was to present his 
six-point government plan. He gave each of the ministers of his 
cabinet a document symbolizing their commitment -- or their 
taking office. 
  The six major, priority, points of the Jonassaint government 
are: to eradicate criminality; to guarantee safety and peace in 
the nation's homes; to enforce Justice; to halt the boat people 
phenomenon; to lower the cost of living; and to increase the 
public revenues. 
  Jonassaint did not forget the students who will take 
baccalaureat exams this year, nor the arrangements he will set 
up for the electoral deadlines. 
  [Jonassaint] I have identified six essential priorities for 
a 
program of action. The first will have to do with buttressing 
order and security in Haiti within respect for the fundamental 
rights of the citizens. Concerned with eradicating criminality 
in Haiti and thereby establishing a true social peace based on a 
rule of law, my government is willing to firmly ensure the 
protection of lives and property. To that end, a national 
commission to guarantee the safety of the citizenry will be 
created. 
  My government commits itself to strengthening the structures 
of Justice to [word indistinct] to halt the boat-people 
phenomenon. 
  [Luckenson] Jonassaint wants the private sector to 
cooperate with his government, and [says] they can count on his 
commitment and determination to protect their interests. [He 
explains that] he will manage to perform, in keeping with the 
possibilities of the moment. 
  [Jonassaint] As for the private sector, I would like its 
active cooperation in the process begun in the country. It can 
already count on my deep determination to protect its interests. 
  [Luckenson] Thanking the audience, the provisional 
president praised the courage and determination of the ministers 
who make up his cabinet. He asked the ministers to work hard, 
for the job is not easy, while the national and international 
communities are expecting much from them. Although the national 
soul is wounded, the cabinet must work for the people and the 
nation. 
  [Jonassaint] As members of the cabinet, well, I [word 
indistinct] salute your courage and your high sense of civic 
responsibility and patriotism. From now on, the country would 
like to be able to look upon us with pride. The nation's too 
often wounded pride, its so often endangered and even mortgaged 
sovereignty....[changes thought] Let us, then, go and work for 
the Haitian people, for the nation. If someone has something 
[words indistinct] against our lives, then, let us die. 
  [Luckenson] In his speech, which lasted about 10 
minutes, Jonassaint presented himself as an apostle, a prophet 
who will guide those under him toward the path of progress for 
the future. In concluding, Jonassaint said: To die for one's 
homeland is fine; let us dig with pleasure. 
  After his speech, the unofficial Office of the Senate of the 
Republic -- which is presided over by Bernard Sansaricq, a 
member of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion and the family 
of contested senators [issuing from] the [contested] 18 January 
[1993] elections -- paid its respects to Jonassaint; then came 
the turn of Chamber of Deputies delegation made up of Deputies 
Denis Saint-Fort, Emmanuel Reyme, Pierre Francois Vital, Jacques 
Lafleur, and Laguerre. Next, the Armed Forces High Command, 
headed by Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras, gave the provisional 
president a military salute. Respects were then paid to 
Jonassaint by the president and vice-president of the Supreme 
Court of Accounts and Administrative Litigation, the chairman of 
the board of directors of the Banque Nationale de Credit, and 
members and representatives of various opposition parties. 
  In the opinion of attorney Mireille Durocher Bertin, the 
provisional president's principal private secretary, Article 149 
is a partial solution to the crisis the country is experiencing. 
This is a process of national rescue, [she said, and] we are 
moving forward. 
  [Bertin] This process...[changes thought] We are looking for 
a national rescue solution and, as you know, Article 149 is 
(?obviously) a provisional solution. Thus, we are moving 
forward, and with the grace of God, Haiti will be saved. 
  [Luckenson] From what we managed to see, Emmanuel 
Constant, head of the neo-Duvalierist party Revolutionary Front 
for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, was not present, nor 
was engineer Franck Pierre, head of the Capois Lamort 
Organization. Professor [Hubert] de Ronceray was absent as well. 
  According to what we saw, the government is not headed by a 
prime minister. It is made up of only 12 ministers: one woman 
and 11 men. 
  Many observers following the crisis in Haiti are very 
worried, in view of the Haitian people's alarming situation: 
power outages, a high cost of living. In the next few days, the 
international community will strengthen the economic sanctions 
against Haiti, while threats of [military] intervention are 
hanging over the country's head. The question, which remains 
without an answer, is the following: Has Haiti become Hollywood? 
Is it a two-headed country? Two senate presidents are fighting 
for a single chair; there are two presidents of the Republic, 
and two governments of the Republic for a small population, a 
single nation. 
  This is Jean Luckenson for Signal FM.

<F P=106> [By Herold Jean-Francois] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 17 May (EFE) -- Senator Bernard 
Sansaricq, the primary promoter of the installation of Judge 
Emile Jonassaint as chief of the Haitian state, today publicly 
voiced his disagreement with the way in which the new government 
was established. 
  The first differences between the soldiers and the civilians 
who promoted a coup d'etat that toppled constitutional President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide on 30 September 1991 are emerging six 
days after the octogenarian Jonassaint was installed. He also 
matter of factly assumed the post of prime minister on 16 May 
when he established a new government with the military's support. 
  Jonassaint, in a decision enacted by decree, assumed full 
control of the Executive Branch on Monday and announced that he 
would assume the posts of provisional president and prime 
minister. After the de facto ruler made his announcement, 
Acting Prime Minister Robert Malval urged government officials 
and the general public to "ignore all instructions given and 
decisions made" by the Jonassaint Government. 
  Meanwhile, Sansaricq expressed his reservations about 
certain 
ministers appointed by the new government and presented a copy 
of correspondence he exchanged with Jonassaint on 13 May in 
which Sansaricq asked Jonassaint to send to the Senate 
leadership, which he heads, the name of the person who would 
occupy the post of prime minister. Jonassaint, 81, replied that 
after consulting Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert 
Monde, the latter convinced him to not appoint a prime minister 
because of the "special nature" of his government. 
  Hubert Deronceray, leader of the group Mobilization for 
National Development, the main promoter of the implementation of 
Article 149 of the Haitian Constitution, which was the basis for 
the appointment of Jonassaint to the post, accused the "de 
facto" president of violating that constitutional statute. 
Deronceray, who had supported the appointment of the ruler 
imposed by the military men of General Raoul Cedras, the leader 
of the coup against Aristide, said that his party was surprised 
to confirm [comprobar] that Jonassaint violated the Haitian 
Constitution. 
  The right-wing leader, who had hoped he would be appointed 
head of government, accused Jonassaint of eliminating the post 
of prime minister "and of establishing a government without 
consulting the parties." Deronceray described the way in which 
that article was applied as "a shadow of Article 149" and 
stressed he will monitor future developments. 
  Meanwhile, the de facto ministers appointed by Jonassaint 
were installed on 16 May. 
  Robert Malval, the prime minister appointed by Aristide, 
called for fiscal disobedience. Malval, in reaffirming his 
rejection of the Jonassaint government, described as void "all 
decrees, administrative acts, property concessions, and 
creations of associations." [sentence as received] He advised 
state traders that if they supply services to the de facto 
government, such financial obligations will not be honored. 
Malval also said that he will not recognize promotions of 
public administration personnel.

  [Text] The tension in strifetorn Haiti appears to be 
mounting as the opposing factions seem set on a collision 
course. As we hear in this dispatch from (Valery Albert), 
President Clinton's threat of invasion was met with outright 
defiance by the military led by Raoul Cedras. Now has come a new 
move on the part of the legitimate leader, Prime Minister Robert 
Malval. 
  [Begin (Albert) recording] Acting Haitian Prime Minister 
Robert Malval, breaking a six-month silence with a bold act of 
defiance, on Monday called on Army chief General Raoul Cedras to 
resign immediately. Shaking with anger, Malval accused Cedras of 
disgracing his uniform and locking the country in the darkness 
of night by defying international sanctions, and demanding the 
return of democracy and of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
ousted in the 1991 coup. 
  Malval also called on Haiti's civil servants to disobey 
orders from the provisional regime installed by the Army last 
week. Malval has been Haiti's acting prime minister since 
resigning his post in December after the breakdown of the UN 
accord restoring Aristide to power. [end recording]

  [Text] There is grumbling within the National Front for 
Change and Democracy [FNCD] following the decision to 
temporarily suspend the National Congress of Democratic 
Movements [CONACOM] from the FNCD. Senator Turneb explains that 
this suspension was decided in an assembly. Interviewed by our 
colleague Leontes [Dorzilme], Delpe recalled that it is a 
temporary suspension, not an expulsion. Let us listen to the 
report of Dorzilme's report: 
  [Begin Dorzilme recording, in Creole] The pot of division is 
boiling within the FNCD following the front's latest decision 
temporarily suspending CONACOM. However, if we are to believe a 
note dated 10 May, many FNCD member parties say there is no 
breakup within the FNCD, and that the decision that the member 
organizations made as regards CONACOM is only an administrative 
one. 
  This matter developed on 13 May, when we received a note 
signed by Jude Marie Jacinthe, Isaac Garcon, and Mitrany Victor 
as officials of the FNCD parliamentary bloc within the Chamber 
of Deputies. Those people asked that [FNCD spokesmen] Evans Paul 
and Turneb Delpe go back on their decision [temporarily 
suspending CONACOM from FNCD] within 48 hours. They threatened 
to no longer recognize the spokesmen if they failed to do so. 
  The resolution suspending CONACOM from FNCD was voted by a 
minority, according to the note from Jude Marie Jacinthe, who 
shares a position with Dunois Eric Cantave, the person in charge 
of political affairs within CONACOM. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report on Cuban President Fidel Castro's recent visit to </F>
South Africa and Brazil] 
  [Text] On 9 May, at 1907, Cuban President Fidel Castro 
arrived at the Jan Smuts International Airport in Johannesburg 
to participate in ANC President Nelson Mandela's inaugural 
ceremony on the following day. Commander in Chief Fidel Castro 
was honoring an invitation made to him and representatives from 
another 188 nations to witness the triumph of the first 
multiracial elections, the disappearance of racism, and the 
establishment of the first South African Government of national 
unity. 
  Prior to his arrival in South Africa, the Cuban president 
and 
his delegation made a technical stopover in Accra, Ghana, where 
the highest leader of the Cuban Revolution held a friendly 
conversation with President Jerry John Rawlings. The two leaders 
conversed on many topics, but mostly on the ANC and the triumph 
of the electoral process in South Africa. 
  In Pretoria on the morning of 10 May, mankind witnessed a 
political change unprecedented in that nation's history. The 
main news agencies of the world broadcast for more than 2 
billion television viewers the most relevant historic event for 
the public opinion in the course of those 24 hours. Present were 
5,000 invited personalities, 140 governmental delegations, 40 of 
them represented by heads of state and government. Nelson 
Mandela was sworn in for a five-year term. In taking over the 
destiny of South Africa, he stated to the world: We are 
committed to establishing a true and lasting peace, a society of 
which we can feel proud where all South Africans, Blacks and 
Whites, can live without fear for each other. 
  In that context, Fidel Castro dialogued with many heads of 
state and distinguished political figures such as Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Robert 
Mugabe, Sam Nujoma, Frederik de Klerk, John Rawlings, Yasir 
'Arafat, meeting with a total of 30 personalities. 
  At the seat of government in Pretoria, on the morning of 11 
May, Fidel Castro, the president of Councils of State and of 
Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, held official talks with 
South African President Nelson Mandela. 
  [Begin recording] [Mandela, in English with superimposed 
translation into Spanish] Thank you very much. (?We need you.) 
  [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed translation into 
English] Please convey my greetings to Mr. De Klerk. 
  [Mandela, in English with superimposed translation into 
Spanish] Thank you very much, I will do that. 
  [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed translation into 
English] We have witnessed the death of apartheid and the birth 
of freedom. One of the most beautiful things we saw was the 
unity of the South African people from all sectors and all 
ethnic backgrounds, and no one can imagine how many were saying 
that the process continues to evolve in that direction. [end 
recording] 
  On the morning of 12 May, new South African Foreign Minister 
(Alsen Sock) and Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
officially established diplomatic relations between the two 
countries. Hours later, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro made 
remarks to the South African Broadcasting Company, one of the 
stations with greatest repercussions on the national public 
opinion. 
  [Begin recording] [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed 
translation into English] I will say this categorically: These 
have been extraordinary impressions. South Africa was for me a 
mysterious country and I have found an extraordinary country in 
all senses. [end recording] 
  After concluding his visit to South Africa, Cuban President 
Fidel Castro and the delegation that accompanied him made a 
brief stop in the Brazilian state of Salvador de Bahia. On his 
arrival the commander in chief was met by Bahia Governor Antonio 
Inva Say. Fidel also met with former Governor Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes and local authorities. 
  Prior to his departure, Fidel answered the questions of 
Brazilian reporters interested in his visit: 
  [Begin recording, in Spanish with superimposed translation 
into Portuguese] [First unidentified reporter] What is Cuba 
doing to break the economic embargo? 
  [Castro] We are making all kinds of effort. We are working 
in 
the international sphere, at the United Nations, and in all the 
organizations. We promote solidarity. We try whatever is in our 
reach. There is a movement against the blockade that is gaining 
momentum in the United States. The immense majority of the 
countries in the United Nations condemn the blockade. Only two 
or three nations support the blockade. Meanwhile, the blockade 
has to be fought with deeds. With the efforts for the 
development of the country, the financial restructuring, and in 
the difficult circumstances, we also had to adapt ourselves to 
the collapse of the socialist bloc of the USSR which represented 
80 percent of our trade. 
  The embargo has [words indistinct] our fighting spirit and 
resistance. I believe that no other country would have been able 
to resist what Cuba has resisted. Cuba resists, and it will 
continue to resist. In the long run, we will be worthy of the 
victory. 
  [Second unidentified reporter] In the United States, 
presidential candidate Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva called for the 
end of the blockade on Cuba. How do you see the position taken 
by Lula? 
  [Castro] I greatly appreciate his position. He has always 
held that position, as have many other political leaders. 
Generally all the progressive and democratic forces of the world 
oppose the blockade and that number continues to grow. 
  [Second unidentified reporter] What are the expectations for 
and what is the new economic plan to be implemented in Cuba? 
  [Castro] Well, it is not a new economic plan. This new plan 
has a series of measures. We are already developing our [words 
indistinct] adjusted to the conditions of the world we live in, 
which is hegemonized by the United States, without giving up our 
ideals, concepts, or the achievements of socialism. We are 
trying to adapt our economic work to the reality of the world we 
live in. Many are the things that we are doing, without shock 
policies and without haste. Just recently, the National Assembly 
of the People's Government [ANPP] approved a series of measures 
of principles designed to stabilize internal finances, one of 
the many problems we are facing. 
  [Third unidentified reporter] What changes, under these 
measures that were approved by the ANPP? 
  [Castro] Excess currency is reduced. [words indistinct] Cuba 
has done many things. I believe that the things Cuba has done 
can compete in quality and in democratic spirit with those 
things that have been done in many countries around the world. 
Because in our country it is not the party that nominates, but 
the people. In other words, in our country there are 
(?thousands) of parties. Each citizen has the right to nominate 
candidates and has the right to elect them. But since we do not 
have media multinationals, we cannot make our ideas known. 
  [Fourth unidentified reporter] What motivated you to make a 
second visit to Brazil? 
  [Castro] Many things. Let us say that it is geography. It is 
a big country in the southern hemisphere, at the world 
crossroads, a place through which one must pass. That is one 
reason. Another reason is that it is a friendly nation. A third 
is that it is a hospitable country. Fourth, it is a country we 
esteem. Fifth, I feel very happy every time I come here. Sixth, 
because relations between Brazil and Cuba improve everyday. 
  [Fourth unidentified reporter] Why Bahia? 
  [Castro] Because it is on my way. If I am going to Europe, 
for example, I cannot go through the Antarctic. I have to go 
direct to Madrid or Paris. It is an ideal stopover from the 
geographic point of view. From the friendly point of view, I 
know Bahia [words indistinct] We have many friends here who 
always receive us with affection. 
  [Fourth unidentified reporter] Do you have another meeting 
when you leave here? 
  [Castro] Yes, when I leave here I will have a meeting with 
Morpheus. [chuckles] 
  [Fifth unidentified reporter] Will you visit the city? 
  [Castro] I am in a hurry to return. I have been away from 
Cuba for over a week. 
  [Fourth unidentified reporter] At what time are you leaving? 
  [Castro] That is a military secret. [laughs] Probably, 
tomorrow morning. We must leave either in the morning or in the 
evening, depending on the weather. [end recording] 
  Yesterday afternoon [12 May], the commander in chief arrived 
in Havana after a tour that included Barbados, on the occasion 
of the first global conference for the sustainable development 
of insular states; a technical stop in Ghana; the presence of 
Cuba at Nelson Mandela's inaugural ceremony in South Africa; and 
a brief stop in Salvador de Bahia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Cuban President Fidel Castro by unidentified </F>
Cuban reporters in South Africa; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Unidentified reporter] Earlier this month, an ANC 
representative discussed the preceding events and explained 
that, once Nelson Mandela was inaugurated, South Africa would 
proceed to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba. That is 
their intent. They even included this in a document known as the 
New South Africa Foreign Policy Charter. 
  In view of the fact that we have already attended the 
inauguration and that certain talks have been held with cabinet 
representatives, what are the prospects that this will become a 
reality? 
  [Castro] Well, from the point of view of our relations with 
Mandela, the ANC, we have more than diplomatic relations. We 
have had close ties of brotherhood for many years. I believe we 
are family. Regarding foreign relations we are not demanding 
anything, or putting conditions; the closer our friendship with 
a country, the less we ask to establish ties. We allow 
circumstances and the appropriate moment to determine the 
establishment of ties. In the special case of South Africa, at 
this time, we could not make a definitive statement. 
  I have been received here like a brother, like a son. 
However, we have not pressed the issue of formal ties. I believe 
that perhaps tomorrow it will be brought up in the talks with 
the foreign minister. Robertico [Robaina] has been talking with 
the foreign minister. Tomorrow, I will again meet with Mandela. 
Perhaps he will bring this up and ties will be immediately 
established. However, we will not bring it up. We must bear in 
mind what is good for them, and the appropriate moment to 
formalize ties, rather than bringing it up as a demand or as a 
request from us. 
  However, it seems inevitable that those ties will be 
established quickly because there are few countries with whom we 
have stronger ties -- kinship and fraternal ties. 
  Today I greeted almost every minister. I do not speak with 
ministers of other countries. We talked like old relatives. I am 
convinced all of them want the prompt establishment of ties; but 
out of a basic sense of courtesy and respect, we should not 
exert pressure. They can do it whenever they are ready. 
Relations, de facto, are very strong between South Africa and 
Cuba. 
  Now, it is a matter of formalities. That formality could be 
fulfilled today, tomorrow, or the day after. Very soon. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Commander, further on this issue but 
on another aspect, independently of whenever the diplomatic ties 
are established: In what fields do you believe that cooperation 
could be developed the furthest in areas of common interest 
between Cuba and South Africa? 
  [Castro] Whenever we speak with South Africans or South 
African cadres, we discover great prospects. The first thing we 
notice is in the spiritual sphere. When they talk with us, at 
times, the things they say truly moved us. They express a 
fondness for Cuba which leaves us really speechless. There is an 
incredible bond of affection. I believe that few times has there 
been such a great bond with any country. When we speak with them 
and discuss their plans and ideas, given South Africa's 
condition, on one hand they have great development and high 
living standards; on the other hand, great social needs, for 
example, enormous need for housing, public health, schooling, 
and jobs. I was talking with the transportation people. I was 
introduced to every minister today at the luncheon. I was told 
they have many people who lack the means to move. I spoke with 
the transportation minister who said he has a difficult task 
ahead of him because means of transportation are inadequate even 
though it is a developed country. South Africa is a developed 
country. It has important technology, important industries; yet 
it has a large population that for many years has lived under 
apartheid and has a great stash of needs and dreams of a better 
life. 
  Therefore, the government is faced with having to find 
solutions to those problems. When you speak with the 
transportation minister you find out about these needs. When you 
speak with the housing minister, you find out about those great 
needs. When you speak with the sports ministers, you find about 
their dreams of developing sports. If you talk with the public 
health minister, you see their dreams of improving their 
people's health services; thus, the enormous social sphere on 
which there are prospects for cooperation between both nations. 
This would be beneficial both ways: cooperation from us based on 
our experiences, as well as South African cooperation based on 
their experiences, and technological development. 
  [Text] I also spoke with the education minister. They have 
great education projects. In other words, all you need to do is 
talk a while with each one of these cadres and ministers to 
understand that there is a very broad field for cooperation 
between Cuba and South Africa. This is undoubtedly the most 
developed country in southern Africa. 
  You should see the road infrastructure. I was telling the 
transportation minister: You may have a problem of not enough 
means of transportation, but you have great roads. They have 
good infrastructure in many areas. The problem is that the 
wealth has not been distributed fairly. You find, next to a 
superdeveloped world, let us say, an underdeveloped world. 
  With no other country, even in Latin America, are there such 
prospects for cooperation as there are between South Africa and 
Cuba, to the extent that we seriously work and study 
possibilities and continue to develop that highly fraternal and 
warm bond between our two peoples. I must add that we have taken 
notice of the very respectful treatment extended to us by every 
social sector, not only by ANC members but by the nonblack and 
mixed blood sectors, as well. We have also been welcomed by the 
white population. We have to keep in mind that this is a 
multiracial nation with millions of people from diverse ethnic 
backgrounds who have a vital need to cooperate among themselves. 
Today, we saw this spirit of cooperation. 
  Everyone is saying, and justifiably, that the hardest part 
begins now. Everyone knows that the hardest part follows the 
period of change, of liberation. That is true. I do not think 
his [Mandela's] task is easy. However, I believe that they have 
developed a significant talent to find solutions. What we saw 
today heightened our optimism regarding South Africa's future. 
Although we cannot say that South Africa's problems are solved, 
they have solved great problems. They have reached today, but I 
think they are going to have to continue the struggle. There is 
no doubt that Mandela is the man with all the qualifications to 
lead this process. He has secured decisive support. I believe he 
has to continue working to consolidate what has been achieved so 
far and avoid divisiveness. A united country is essential. This 
is what we most hope for, and we hope they attain it. Cuba will 
be very proud to develop cooperation with South Africa. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Commander, right now, in such a 
convulsed world, what does Mandela's victory mean for the 
progressive forces? 
  [Castro] I believe it is a great victory, a great victory of 
the South African peoples, the African people, and all the 
progressive forces in the world. It is a veritable example and 
hope. I believe that South Africa is called upon to exert a 
great and positive influence over the entire continent. It is a 
renaissance, a revival, proof that great victories can be 
achieved even after the disasters that have befallen the world 
and that many things are still possible in a unipolar world. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Commander, for many years, Cuba and 
South Africa had great differences because of Angola. Did you 
ever think then, or later, that you would be here today in the 
former capital of apartheid? 
  [Castro] Well, there are two South Africas and two moments 
in 
history. For specific reasons, strong clashes took place at a 
certain time in history. Now, however, there is a new South 
Africa in which such clashes no longer exist -- only peace, 
harmony, respect, and affection. 
  Your question dealing with Angola is very difficult to 
answer. First of all, we had to save Angola and its 
independence. We were in Angola for 15 years. From the beginning 
of intervention by foreign forces in Angola, we gave it our 
support -- for 15 years. So many things happened. We had a 
strong presence, but it was not strong enough because we could 
not, nor did it depend on us alone to, reach a solution to the 
problem. 
  In Angola we fought with the greatest selflessness. The rest 
was the responsibility of the Angolan people. We were not 
Angola's only supporters. Nevertheless, we can say that we 
helped, selflessly and with great loyalty. I would say that our 
support was very efficient, and that Cuba's support was not only 
efficient, but intelligent. We have no reason to regret anything 
we did. Rather, we could say that several difficult times were 
confronted -- difficult but not through our fault. Cuba 
fulfilled its duty every step of the way. Cuba contributed to 
the solution of the highly difficult problems that arose. I do 
not want to criticize anyone. I believe today is not a day to 
criticize. Perhaps history will record this. 
  This reminds me of what Jose Eduardo [dos Santos] said to 
me during today's luncheon, the very heartfelt, friendly words 
from the depths of his soul regarding the [words indistinct] 
meaning of Cuba's support to the southern Africa nations of 
Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. He pronounced truly moving 
words. This is why, in the analysis of our conscience, we find 
nothing to reproach. 
  In one of the most difficult periods, in the end, we had to 
make very hard decisions; and we did so. They were the correct 
decisions. The problem had to be solved. We could not afford to 
be so weak that we had to endure foreign intervention and be 
strong enough to solve the issues of foreign intervention. In 
such cases, if you are weak, you may incur a great defeat; if 
you are strong, you can spare many lives. This is the way it 
happened in Angola. We accumulated such a potential that it was 
possible to solve the conflict with a minimal loss of lives. 
Those were decisions made by Cuba, alone and solely. History has 
been distorted many times; but in 1975, when we decided to help 
the Angolan people against foreign intervention, the decision 
was Cuba's alone. At other times when we had to act in difficult 
situations, the decisions were Cuba's alone; at times, it is sad 
to say, in order to overcome mistakes made by others. I do not 
want to say by whom. However, I am not going to blame the 
Angolans; it was others. 
  We found we needed to act; even in the last, very difficult 
situation, mistakes were made -- not our mistakes. That final 
situation was decisive or Angola would have been lost, with all 
the consequences and losses that would mean for the Angolan 
people and ourselves. All this influenced the events that 
afterward culminated in those negotiations by virtue of which 
Namibia's independence was attained with the implementation of 
Resolution 435. 
  I think this helped accelerate the process of the South 
African struggle against apartheid. The main, essential, and 
decisive merit belongs to the South African people. Our action 
might have helped accelerate that process. This is how we see 
it. This is a subject on which we have to be very careful. We 
should not be the ones speaking about this, but others. The 
South African and Angolan peoples have spoken of the selfless 
and noble solidarity of Cuba with their countries. We lived 
diverse moments which I believe shall be recorded in history as 
they happened. 
  To date, I see the events and development of the situation 
in 
South Africa as something wonderful. Much depends on what 
happens in South Africa, whether the country attains peace, 
harmony, and unity. This is what all of us ought to struggle for 
and contribute toward, so that the result of the efforts and 
sacrifices of many create a country that can serve as a model to 
the world on how to solve such complex problems as the ones 
experienced here. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Commander, do you not believe that 
this history is being written now? Today, Mandela referred to 
the guests at the inauguration, you among them, and said, and I 
quote: Not too long ago, we had to fight and in that struggle 
many nations helped us, nations represented here today. 
  [Castro] I believe he said more: Nations which even spilled 
their blood. 
  Yes, I was moved by that part of the speech. We owe a debt 
to 
history for the possibility of giving, offering, and reflecting 
on the essence of everything that has happened in the last 18 or 
19 years. It is now 1994 and this began in 1975. Actually, it 
began before 1975 with our cooperation with the peoples of 
Guinea-Bissau and Angola, who were fighting against Portuguese 
colonialism. All in all, it began over 30 years ago. 
  The main part took place after 1975 when Cuba made a full 
commitment, when the Revolution committed itself fully. We have 
to point out that our Revolution played all its cards in that 
struggle, and more than once. A defeat under those conditions 
would have meant the end of the Cuban Revolution. 
  All this happened after 1975. We have to gather all that 
information. We have not yet written the history of the Cuban 
Revolution, but one of the most brilliant pages of the history 
of the Cuban Revolution was its selfless cooperation and 
solidarity with Africa. As someone once said, the leader of 
Guinea-Bissau, I remember, Amilcar [Cabral] said: When we are 
independent, Cape Verde and Cuba should become a federation. 
That is what he said. By this, I mean to say that he had 
extraordinary internationalist feelings. He is the one who said 
that someday our dead from Angola would rise up to negate the 
smear campaigns against Cuba by those who say that Cuba had 
ulterior economic and material motives in Angola. 
  He said those unforgettable words. Amilcar's death was 
truly sad. He was assassinated as other leaders have been. It 
pains me that (Zamora Machel) was not present in this 
celebration. It pains me that Oliver Tambo was not here today. 
There were so many people who struggled and deserved to see a 
day like today. It is painful to remember that they are no 
longer with us. However, we have the consolation of knowing that 
their work yielded fruit and is present in all these things we 
are seeing. 
  Well, our history could not have been more selfless, more 
supporting, more noble than that we have written in connection 
with the peoples of Africa and other parts of the world. I 
believe we have been steadfast toward our African heritage, our 
cultural heritage, our blood lines; toward our principles of 
solidarity with people struggling to gain their independence, 
their freedom; toward our principles of commitment to just 
causes in this world. We will never regret this. I believe 
future generations will always remember this with pride. 
  However, we must assume full responsibility with history, by 
ensuring that it gets written. It is about time to write down 
history. Or others will -- and who knows what they would write? 
  [Unidentified reporter] We have witnessed the burial of 
apartheid, yet everyone is filled with happiness and joy; we 
experienced it this morning at the inauguration. 
  [Castro] We have witnessed the burial of apartheid and the 
birth of freedom. What we witnessed today is beautiful in the 
extreme. One of the most beautiful things we saw was the unity 
among the South African people, among every sector, and every 
ethnic group. You cannot imagine how much we wish right now that 
this process continue developing in that direction. 
  There are many things remaining in this world to be buried, 
however; and it seems the number of undertakers is on the 
increase everywhere. We also saw this in Barbados [words 
indistinct] irresponsibility which with the world's natural 
resources and living conditions are being destroyed. The number 
of undertakers of evil is on the increase, as well as the number 
of midwives of good.

<F P=106> [Report by Beatriz Padron from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] In accordance with its policy of fostering and 
promoting sustained progress in the scientific-technical area -- 
particularly, in peaceful uses of nuclear energy -- Cuba has 
been playing for several years a pivotal role in the Arcal 
[expansion unknown] project. Arcal is a program that includes 
17 Latin American countries, which seek to give their 
specialists access to state-of- the-art nuclear techniques and 
enable them to study the use of those techniques in all possible 
areas regarding the economic and social development of their 
nations. Here is Daniel Codorniu, vice secretary of the SEAN 
[Executive Secretariat for Nuclear Affairs], organization 
responsible for the Cuban nuclear program, with details: 
  [Codorniu] "Arcal is sponsored by the International 
Organization of Atomic Energy in order to promote cooperation 
among various Latin American countries for the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy. Cuba has participated in this program since 
1987, and in the past years, our participation has increased. 
During this period, the program has implemented 12 projects, 
which are mostly related to the issue of applying nuclear 
techniques to solve social and economic development problems and 
establishing regulations and procedures to guarantee security 
[words indistinct]." 
  Cuban technicians and specialists will have an opportunity 
to 
exchange views and results in this area during the 11th Arcal 
Coordination Meeting to be held in Santa Fe de Bogota from 16-20 
May. 
  [Codorniu] "During this meeting in Santa Fe de Bogota, we 
will discuss plans for 1995 and 1996 in addition to reviewing 
the program for the remainder of 1994. We are planning to 
include some new programs that Cuba has been supporting because 
they have a strong influence in our development. For instance, 
we are proposing a new program called induced mutations related 
with [word indistinct] and technology for improving crops in 
Latin America. This new program supports the joint use of 
nuclear and biotechnological methods to produce a better variety 
of crops." 
  Other events confirm Cuba's advances in nuclear technology. 
Daniel Codornieu believes the best example is Cuba's acceptance, 
at the end of 1993, as a full-fledged member of the prestigious 
American Nuclear Society's Latin American Division. The 
American Nuclear Society also seeks to coordinate nuclear 
efforts on the continent. 
  [Codorniu] "This is important because, as you saw [word 
indistinct], the former program is basically linked with nuclear 
applications in areas such as agriculture and medicine. 
Although the Latin American division deals with application 
concerns, it concentrates on energy problems -- the issue of 
developing nuclear energy to generate electricity -- and 
investigations in the area of nuclear energy [word indistinct]. 
As a result, we are also able to collaborate in the area of 
nuclear security."

  [Text] Humberto Rodriguez Gonzalez, president of the 
People's Government in Santa Clara, has stated that the current 
process in which delegates present progress reports to their 
voters has begun in Villa Clara Province and is going well. 
Rodriguez said that the idea of backing the measures approved by 
the national parliament has prevailed at the meetings, and that 
the delegates are well-prepared, fully informed on every matter 
concerning the population, in an effort to find solutions, or at 
least study the causes, of the difficulties. 
  The Santa Clara Administrative Council has agreed to begin 
having locally run enterprises reflect upon application of and 
compliance with the policy of (?cadres), very particularly those 
things having to do with workers' living standards. For this 
latter, an overall program will be formulated that will 
encourage an administrative leader to feel like one of the 
workers, but with greater responsibilities.

  [Text] The subject of economic efficiency at each 
individual work center is at the heart of the discussions in the 
assemblies process being massively held by the CTC [Cuban 
Workers Federation] and its unions, as of today, in the same 
spirit as the recently held Parliaments in the Workplace. These 
assemblies began last month as pilot assemblies and will 
continue through the month of June, with the objective of 
avoiding marathons and favoring proper preparation of these 
meetings, which should be open and free of preconceived outlines. 
  The national leadership of the CTC has told its unions to be 
demanding regarding administrative reports, which may not 
contain justifications, but must instead be very objective about 
what needs be done at the work center to (?prioritize) 
difficulties and achieve efficiency. (?To begin) the assemblies, 
last Monday's [9 May] TRABAJADORES editorial will be read. That 
editorial is about this process.

  [Text] Orlando Lugo Fonte, national president of ANAP 
[National Association of Small Farmers], has explained that 
small farmers and members of cooperatives should clearly 
understand that one must be profitable as a result of increased 
agricultural-livestock production only, not higher crop prices. 
Speaking before more than 200 delegates, among them the 
presidents of 48 CPA's [agricultural-livestock cooperatives], 
whose production cost per peso does not exceed 50 centavos, 
Lugo, who is a member of the Council of State, reiterated that, 
for the economy, that is the useful path to take. 
  At this cooperative and small-farmer event, which is being 
held in the capital on the occasion of 17 May, Agriculture 
Minister Alfredo Jordan spoke of incorporating (Fregatte) 
irrigating machines as part of the strategy aimed at increasing 
production. Jordan pointed out, as a serious current difficulty, 
the acquisition of seeds, as well as the need for each producer 
to produce and preserve the seeds he uses to grow his crops.

  [Text] Between the last half of 1993 and the first quarter 
of 1994, Havana has experienced the greatest shortage of 
medicines ever remembered by health authorities. This was stated 
on 15 May by Public Health Minister Julio Teja in referring to 
the need for and advantages of the medicine distribution program: 
  [Begin Teja recording] We continue hoping to find the ideal, 
perfect method where there is an explanation for everything and 
everyone understands everything. What are the risks we run? The 
products and raw materials are arriving now, following the 
efforts made by the government, and we are able to increase the 
production of medicines a bit -- not to a level that tomorrow 
will provide medicines of every type, but enough to conduct a 
recovery process. Thus, the term, even in GRANMA, is recovery. 
If we do not implement these measures now, we would have used up 
these medicines we are now getting; by mid- year, when we would 
have to implement the plan, we would have none because they 
would have once more ended in the black market. That is the 
reality. 
  In other words, medicines are ending up in the hands of 
three 
or four people. We cannot engage in a criminal act and hold back 
medicine until we have the perfect program. We have waited 
enough. We have worked with Havana hospitals to ensure the 
supply of the priority medicines. I say this because I believe 
that one of the things we have to do is to make the doctors 
understand. That is the truth. The document states that this is 
the opinion of the government and party leadership. The struggle 
has to be won with the health workers, the doctors, pharmacists, 
everyone in that field. We believe that this battle is being won. 
  I want you to know that it is not only the doctor issuing 
unwarranted prescriptions, knowing full well that the medicine 
is not available. There was the question put by Comrade [Carlos] 
Lage about the doctor who comes -- I was told this by several 
professors and doctors -- to the neighborhood and tells everyone 
that beginning tomorrow, they can forget asking for 
prescriptions because he can only give prescriptions to be 
filled in the area where he lives, 42 km away. This is a way of 
damaging the Revolution. 
  We have to work against this. We have asked the help of the 
party and the unions. We have visited every hospital. Briefings 
have been given to every doctor in the Armed Forces, in every 
military unit. The Interior Ministry has hosted meetings with 
doctors who work in prisons, jails, etc. We have tried to inform 
most. As the banner reads: We will continue to conduct classes 
and reevaluation tests. However, this is a battle. This is 
combat. We have to gain awareness and support; if we had plenty 
of everything, these measures would not be necessary. [end 
recording] 
  Health Minister Julio Teja participated in the meeting of 
presidents of the People's Councils of Havana. Politburo members 
Carlos Lage and Ricardo Alarcon are also attending the meeting. 
Transportation, local industries, and telephone industry issues 
are also slated for discussion.

<F P=106> [Report by Marieta Cabrera] </F>
  [Text] At 0900 on 18 May, the ARC [expansion unknown] 
Gloria, flagship of the Colombian Navy, which is visiting Cuba 
for a second time, put in at the port of the Cuban Revolutionary 
Navy's [MGR] General Staff. The crew, headed by Captain (Eduardo 
Otero Erazo), was greeted by Colombian Ambassador Ricardo 
Santamaria and Captain (Martin Jodar), chief of the MGR General 
Staff, who welcomed the ship to Cuban territory. Over the past 
25 years, this Colombian Navy ship has visited 48 countries on 
five continents. Cuba is the second stop in this year's 
eight-nation tour which began with Kingston, Jamaica. 
  As regards the ship's goals, the ship's captain said the 
following: 
  [Begin recording] [(Otero)] I believe it is going to be a 
very interesting visit, which will serve to further reaffirm the 
ties of friendship and fraternity that exist between the peoples 
of Colombia and Cuba. 
  [Cabrera] Why was Cuba selected? 
  [(Otero)] I believe Cuba was selected because it is one of 
the most important cultures in Latin America, and also to 
reaffirm the ties of friendship between the two countries. [end 
recording] 
  The flagship's crew met with Rear Admiral Pedro Perez 
Betancourt, chief of the MGR, who expressed to the Colombian 
crew the interest the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] minister 
and the chief of the General Staff have in this visit. He also 
discussed the naval history of the two nations and weather 
conditions en route to Cuba. 
  During their stay, the visitors will have a busy agenda 
which 
includes meeting members of the FAR and the population in 
general while the ship is open to visitors.

  [Text] A delegation of Colombian businessmen just made a 
visit to Cuba, where they analyzed investment possibilities in 
Cuban production and service sectors. The Colombian businessmen 
worked on identifying investment possibilities in the tourism, 
sugar, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries, the 
agricultural-livestock sector, and basic industries, among 
others. 
  Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Investment and 
Economic Cooperation, and the Cuban Chamber of Commerce provided 
the visitors with extensive information and debated the ideas 
proposed by the Colombian delegation on future joint projects. 
The Colombian delegation also learned of Cuban legislation 
regarding foreign investments and preparations for the eventual 
approval of a law for mutual promotion and protection of that 
type of business. Part of the group participated in the Cuba-94 
tourism convention which is being held in Varadero, since that 
sector contains immediate possibilities for bilateral 
cooperation.

    [Editorial Report] Havana Cuba Vision Network in Spanish at 
0130 GMT on 18 May carries the Open Agenda program with host 
Antonio Resillez and guest Public Health Minister Julio Teja. 
The program focuses on the new medicine distribution plan. 
  Resillez states that there are 135 essential medicines, of 
which 73 are included in the control card system. Teja states: 
"It is a reality for our people that there is a level of 
frustration caused by the lack of medicine nationwide. This 
began to intensify in the second half of 1993 and intensified 
even more in the first quarter of 1994." Teja says that the new 
distribution plan has the "full support of the government 
leadership and the Communist Party of Cuba." He adds that 
resources are limited and therefore: "There is not going to be 
an overnight overabundance of medicines, nor are distribution 
levels going to be restored. The recovery process that began 
today in Havana is, rather, a process of recovery." Teja 
stresses that it is important not to build false expectations 
among the population and that many have commented that the 
medicine distribution plan is somewhat confusing. 
  Teja adds: "The main goal is to ensure the availability of 
medications. We have created conditions to ensure that there are 
more medications than last year and hope figures similar to 
those of 1992 will be attained. The essential medicine group 
includes medicines sold by control cards, those required for 
chronic or long-term illnesses." 
  In answer to a question by Resillez, Teja says that the 
chronic category comprises 2 million people with mainly 
cardiovascular ailments, asthma, diabetes, etc. Teja says that 
the main change is in monitoring mechanisms, and that the 
process of medical certificates is being reviewed because there 
have been many irregularities and the goal is to ensure that 
norms are complied with. He says medical certificates will be 
reviewed and people will be issued new cards with a minimum of 
inconveniences. Regarding the controlled sales of 29 medicines, 
Teja adds that these will replace unregulated sales. He says 
that production of herbal medicines and medications derived from 
bees will be boosted and are not included in the new 
distribution system. 
  Regarding sanitary pads for women, Teja states that there 
was 
a dire shortage in 1993 and that 1994's production goal is to 
make 16 million packages of 10 sanitary pads, or twice previous 
production figures. He adds this will not solve the shortage, 
however, because as many as 20 million packages were produced 
annually in previous years. 
  Teja stresses the importance of the People's Councils and 
the 
Family Doctor Pprogram in implementing the medicine distribution 
plan. He explains that the ration book is the identification 
document to be used in the neighborhood pharmacies, although the 
medicine acquired will not be recorded on it. A record of 
medications sold to the individual will be kept by the pharmacy 
itself. He adds: "The community has developed mechanisms to 
ensure that families can acquire medicines but avoid people 
buying medicines simply because they are entitled to do so. This 
is a concept we have to eliminate, and that is going to be done 
through education and through monitoring by community medicine 
committees, Family Doctor Program doctors, etc. The population 
should not buy such things, like they do at the grocery store, 
just because they are entitled to do so. We want to have a 
stable availability of products at the pharmacies." 
  Teja adds that the new plan is not rigid and that people 
will 
be able to buy "minimal necessary amounts" of medications at 
pharmacies in other neighborhoods in order to meet emergency 
needs. 
  Resillez points out that medicine production increased to 
approximately 60 million pesos in 1993 and is expected to reach 
to 84 million in 1994. Teja adds that this increase reflects 
higher production levels, and that medicine prices will remain 
stable. He makes a comparison between prices in Cuba and Spain 
stressing that medicine prices abroad are much higher. Teja adds 
that Cuba imported approximately $22.3 million in medicines and 
raw materials in 1993, that $25 million have been allocated for 
medicine imports in 1994, and that efforts are being made to 
replace imports by producing alternative materials and thereby 
increasing the availability of medicines. 
  Teja adds that the possibility of, as was suggested in the 
Parliaments in the Workplace, charging for the vitamin pills 
being distributed to the population is being studied and that 
should this occur, the vitamin complex will be available at a 
low cost. Teja points out that exporting Cuban-made medicines 
rather than reducing the medicine supply, contributes to 
producing more medicines for national consumption. He concludes 
by stating that experience has shown that rigid nationwide plans 
are not effective; therefore, "general guidelines have been 
issued, and every province is allowed to draft its own plan to 
meet specific social and geographical conditions." 
  Teja concludes by expressing his optimism for the new plan 
and welcomes the idea of appearing on the Open Agenda program 
again, along with other Public Health sector figures.

  [Text] Today the presidents of the 102 People's Councils of 
the city of Havana analyzed the support these organizations are 
to provide in monitoring the new national medications program 
that will go into in effect as of tomorrow in this capital. 
Provincial health director Dr. Pastor Castell explained that 
this plan seeks to gradually ensure that the necessary medicines 
are physically supplied by the medical-pharmaceutical industry, 
to perfect distribution, and to link every welfare institution 
to a particular pharmacy. Castell explained that the success of 
the new program also depends on knowing in advance what 
medicines these pharmacies have and, in keeping with this, 
prescribing those medicines to one's patients. Castell said that 
among the plan's objectives are to get the medications to 
whoever really needs them and to have the population feel 
satisfied. The plan will also combat speculation or illegal 
sales of medicines that are in short supply.

<F P=106> [By Angel Leon Cabrera] </F>
  [Text] As a consequence of the heavy rains that affected 
the eastern part of our country last Sunday [15 May], one 
citizen died in Soledad de Mayari, 70 km north of Santiago de 
Cuba. 
  At approximately 1500 on Sunday, 15 May, it began to rain in 
Soledad de Mayari. This town, located 70 km north of Santiago de 
Cuba, could not imagine that only a few minutes later, the 
apparently inoffensive Soledad River would acquire such force. 
When things calmed down, it was possible to verify the effects 
of such rains. Antonio Pena Barrera, 41, died. Two other people 
were injured, and 62 houses were seriously damaged. Almost all 
families who live on the banks of the river lamented the loss of 
something. Risking his life, one man was able to rescue the yoke 
of his oxen. Moreover, 20 km of highway was damaged and a bridge 
totally destroyed. 
  Damages to agriculture and to electricity lines were also 
reported. The El Cate dam could not resist the force of the 
waters. Only by listening to witnesses can one understand the 
scope of the damages. One man who lived here all his life said 
this never happened before. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified first witness] I do not 
remember anything like this. 
  [Leon Cabrera] There are others who go even further. 
  [Unidentified second witness] I have never witnessed 
anything 
like this in the 45 years I have lived here. [end recording] 
  The heavy rains lasted a little more than 30 minutes, which 
caused the river to overflow. In less than 30 minutes, the rains 
caused all this disaster. It is not difficult to suppose, then, 
what would have happened if these rains had lasted longer. This 
is an important lesson in this recovery stage.

  [Excerpts] As the much talked about newfound relationship 
between Communist Cuba and Caricom gathers momentum, Cuba's 
President Fidel Castro says he is eagerly looking forward to 
this new development. Speaking with Caribbean Broadcasting 
Union's (Sharon Marshall) following his attendance at the recent 
SIDS [expansion unknonw] conference, President Fidel Castro said 
that he is of the opinion that only good things will result from 
such a collaboration. 
  [Passage omitted] Meanwhile, St. Lucia's ambassador to the 
United Nations, Dr. Charles Fleming, has welcomed the new 
Cuba/Caricom relations. According to Dr. Fleming, St. Lucia's 
relationship with Cuba declined during the U.S. invasion of 
Grenada. Dr. Fleming, however, is of the opinion that the Cold 
War is over and the time is opportune to pick up where it was 
left off: 
  [Begin Fleming recording] Last year, for the first time in a 
long time, St. Lucia in fact joined other members of the UN in 
calling for an end to the U.S. embargo against Cuba. This is in 
keeping with the lessening of tensions. Cuban expatriate groups, 
mostly in Miami, who are strongly antagonistic (?toward) Cuba, 
have also changed their position and are calling for an end to 
the Cuban embargo. Cuba in fact is a Caribbean country. Because 
of the embargo, it has developed a good deal of appropriate 
indigenous technology from which we can benefit. So, St. Lucia 
believes that the time has come to end the embargo. We believe 
that St. Lucia can only gain from close relations with Cuba.

  [Text] In a news conference, Brigadier General Luis Perez, 
chief of the Military Industries Union, UIM [Union de Industrias 
Militares], reported that this year the UIM will earmark 28 
percent of its production for the national economy. Gen. Perez 
added that in 1993, the UIM allotted 25 percent of its 
production to the internal market and it intends to contribute 
40 percent of its production in 1995. 
  He explained that in the past, the UIM had only provided 
service to the Armed Forces, but that due to the current 
difficulties, it has decided to help the national economy. 
These industries manufacture carts for sugarcane transport, 
cutting tools, agricultural appliances, wheelbarrows, 
compressors, and other items in great demand.

take 20 days. Afterwards, they will continue with the repairs to 
the air-preheating system, change the air ducts, and install a 
forced-air fan and a seawater pump. 
  The maintenance is scheduled to be done within 70 work 
shifts, but the workers expect to conclude it in 60, as they did 
before, with generator unit No. 5. Once the maintenance work is 
completed, generator unit No. 6 will produce 110 megawatt-hours, 
in contrast to the mere 45 megawatt-hours currently being

<F P=106> [Interview with Division General Mario Rene Enriquez </F>
Morales, Guatemalan defense minister, by Carmen Aida Ibarra and 
Jose Ruben Zamora; place and date not given] 
  [Text] In this interview, Defense Minister Div. Gen. Mario 
Enriquez Morales criticizes the meager contribution made by 
Guatemalans -- especially politicians -- to the peace process 
and says that talks with the URNG [Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity] might last until 1995. 
  He also admits that the Army has made a major effort to 
balance two different issues things: tolerance of officials 
involved in the political-ideological arena with the 
antisubversive campaign of those officials who remain in the 
mountains fighting the guerrillas. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] How far is the Army willing to go 
vis-a-vis 
negotiations with the URNG? 
  [Enriquez] Our desire for peace is genuine, but that does 
not 
mean we will leave it up to the URNG to do whatever it wants 
with the Guatemalan Army. We are willing to go as far as the 
URNG did in its response to the overall proposal and as far as 
the government did in its response to that proposal. 
  They might want to ask for things beyond that point, which 
could exacerbate the situation. The constitutional president of 
the Republic is our commander in chief, and it will be up to him 
to set the limits for the Army. As our commander in chief, I do 
not think he will set us adrift. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] To accept...to what extent? Despite the 
military's claim that they are apolitical and nondeliberative, 
they are doing just the opposite. 
  [Enriquez] That is your view because we speak to the media. 
Those who speak up the most are Gen. Enriquez, Colonel Morris 
Eugenio De Leon, and our spokeswoman. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] It is not only my opinion. Gen. Pineda 
Carranza and Gen. Balconi Turcios, among others, have also spoke 
out recently, and their public statements have triggered various 
comments, one of which is that the Army has entered the 
political arena and is actively participating... 
  [Enriquez] We are speaking up because various national 
sectors and participants are inviting us to different forums. 
We believe that, as part of Guatemalan society, we must attend 
all these events. We cannot withdraw from that area because the 
Army is being criticized by its enemies. That is why we accept 
all invitations. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What concessions are you willing to make 
during the negotiations? 
  [Enriquez] We are concerned about and interested in all the 
topics on the agenda. After all, we are Guatemalan citizens 
first, soldiers second. 
  We are concerned about what might happen if a national 
constituent assembly is formed and about the changes it might 
make in the Constitution. We are interested in future 
developments in the agrarian situation because it could trigger 
a disaster, a social turmoil...because the potential for 
violence exists. 
  We are also concerned about the issues of Indian peoples. We 
hope the efforts to polarize Guatemalan society along ethnic 
lines do not succeed, because we must preserve general peace. 
There are some aspects of Agreement 169 that are 
unconstitutional. They must be made to fit within the 
Constitution. 
  We are even more concerned about issues that are closely 
related to the Army and which concern us directly. That is 
normal. Just as the Chamber of Agriculture has great interest 
in the agrarian situation, we are very concerned about the truth 
commission. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Why are you concerned? 
  [Enriquez] How could we not be? We have not become 
belligerent, but we know well that some people seek to morally 
destroy the Army as an institution through accusations made by 
an illegal, clandestine, and illegitimate minority. 
  I think it would be unfair to omit the names of those who 
have been URNG militants since 1960, or those of union leaders, 
university students, and all those who became involved in this. 
  Too many parties were involved, including countries like 
Cuba, where nearly everyone received training. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Mexico...? 
  [Enriquez] Mexico...well, there is no reason not to mention 
that country just because they are being so nice and hospitable 
to us. Reality prevails there. Aren't the guerrilla commanders 
in Mexico. Do they not give refuge to the guerrillas? Did the 
refugees not go there? Didn't the CPR [Communities of Resistant 
People] go there when we entered Ixcan? It is a sanctuary for 
subversion. 
  The URNG wants the commission to have some specific tasks; 
for example, they want them to have judicial functions. In that 
case its purpose would not be reconciliatory because it would 
open wounds that have already healed. It would be a commission 
of revenge. 
  Anyone who focuses on revenge keeps his own wounds open. The 
URNG's wounds are undoubtedly still open because it did not gain 
power and would like to destroy those who opposed their reaching 
it; in this case, the Army. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] You have said that you will be tolerant in 
the negotiations. Do you think it will do any good? 
  [Enriquez] I don't think it will do any good, but many think 
it will. I would like to find someone who could convince me, 
because I have said -- maybe too intensely -- that a truth 
commission will not reconcile us. 
  I will say it again. Whether or not this commission is 
authorized, I will say it today and always: It will not 
reconcile us. There is international proof that will not 
reconcile us. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Give us an example. 
  [Enriquez] What happened in Argentina? The Painted Faces 
appeared and there was a serious confrontation. They were 
killing each other in El Salvador. If general amnesty had not 
been declared three days later, who knows what would have 
happened... 
  With all those precedents, why are we going to get involved 
in this? We do not fear the commission or the truth. We have 
told them that we fear the truth that "you, who are clandestine 
and illegal, want to apply against the Army." 
  In the case of the truth commission, we have a ceiling and a 
floor. You can be fully assured that the ceiling does not 
include our military personnel putting their heads in the main 
plaza to have them cut off. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Your position that all sectors be tried, 
including nations, could hinder an agreement, clarifications 
could become unrealistic. 
  [Enriquez] It would be more unrealistic if all sectors were 
not included. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] But the armed conflict was between the 
Army 
and the rebels... 
  [Enriquez] That is what some believe: The Army and the 
guerrillas were involved, no one else. That is untrue. It 
cannot be. There were many actors here...Let everything come 
out in the open. 
  Unions and political parties have been infiltrated. Donaldo 
Alvarez Ruiz and Valiente Tellez were not soldiers. I am 
certain there were death squads that were not created by the 
military, either. So it is not just the Army and the URNG. It 
is not just Guatemala. Mexico, Cuba, Russia, and Nicaragua were 
involved. Isn't that where the arsenals came from? 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What about the nations that supported the 
Army...? 
  [Enriquez] That's the bad part, no one helped us. We were 
left alone, they wanted to finish us off once and for all. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] How will the officers react if the 
government accepts a commission such as that wanted by the URNG? 
  [Enriquez] I think the officers will not be pleased at all. 
I 
like to respond directly, which is why I say they will not be 
satisfied. We are not willing to go to our deaths like little 
lambs to the slaughter. We prefer to die fighting. We have 
told the URNG this. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] One can perceive opposing attitudes in the 
armed institution. On the one hand, you are playing in the 
political arena with open and tolerant policies, while on the 
other hand, the officers and soldiers are fighting the 
guerrillas in the conflict areas with counter-subversive polices 
because they remain in the area of confrontation. How can the 
positions be reconciled? 
  [Enriquez] You are right. We learned this from the URNG. 
They have a local and international attitude and yet another 
attitude for their combatants. If we do not get smart, they are 
going to beat us. 
  The soldier is trained to fight. The second lieutenant, the 
lieutenant, the captain, and the major are trained to fight. 
Meanwhile, the lieutenant colonel, the colonel, and the general 
have to be prepared to work in the political-ideological arena, 
not in the party aspect, to defend the Army. 
  We have always said that militarily we are superior, but 
politically the URNG is ahead of us. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What specifically are you doing to 
reconcile both viewpoints and attitudes? 
  [Enriquez] We are doing a lot in the Army. It is a lot of 
work because we know that a military and political effort must 
be made to consolidate peace in Guatemala. 
  Each officer and soldier knows that we have opened our arms 
to peace, but they also know that as long as there is an armed 
conflict, we must fulfill our constitutional duty to effectively 
combat subversion. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] How have officers in the conflict areas 
reacted to the withdrawal of detachments from the resettlement 
areas and to the orders that they must treat the displaced and 
returning refugees as brothers when they have always seen them 
as guerrillas? 
  [Enriquez] That shows you how the Army has changed, because 
the message has reached all levels. The officers agree with 
what is happening. You cannot imagine how the commander talked 
to all those people when the soldiers withdrew from Tercer 
Pueblo after so many years, so many dead and wounded, and so 
many harassment attacks. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] But if there are two viewpoints or 
attitudes and no institutional position, there might be concern 
that someone could suddenly come out and say there is dissension 
in the ranks. 
  [Enriquez] I do not know if there is dissension in the 
ranks. 
A lieutenant in Playa Grande told me in front of 52 officers: 
"General, I am very sorry we have left Tercer Pueblo." He spoke 
to me about our dead and wounded and how we were giving up by 
withdrawing from Tercer Pueblo. 
  I replied: "You are right. As a lieutenant, that is how you 
must think, and I congratulate you. I am also sorry, but we 
have to open our arms to peace, to those who return, and to the 
CPR so we can begin walking on the path to peace. But that is 
the way a military man must think," I told him. 
  A candle must not be so close that it burns the saint's 
statue but not so far away that it doesn't illuminate it. They 
were given the urban area of Tercer Pueblo, but we were left on 
the outskirts, because that was the agreement and because 
constitutionally we can be there. 
  We removed the Cuarto Pueblo detachment from where it was 
because the CPR were very close, 1,200 meters away, and we 
placed it at the border with Mexico. Now they say we have them 
surrounded because we are in Mayaland, Monaco, Xalbal...but 
that's life. 
  Nevertheless, I can assure you that our position is unified. 
It is the same for everyone. It is one of opening, even though 
the desire to fight must continue to exist among our people 
until all of this ends. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Do the changes in the Army also include 
cleaning up the institution, as you recently told the media? 
  [Enriquez] I told the media and I also told the officers 
that 
I want the Army to take a bath with the best soap. I also told 
them that it would be "an external bath, because I cannot go 
into your consciences." 
  Nevertheless, I warned them that "you will pay for any error 
that you individually or any group of you commits and that 
compromises the armed institution. The law will be enforced. 
Let us hope it falls with greatest severity on those who commit 
the error." 
  That is what we must do. We are determined. All the 
commanders know this. We will not tolerate anything. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] When you spoke of a cleanup, you also said 
you wanted to solve the crime against anthropologist Myrna 
Mack... 
  [Enriquez] I believe that has already been solved. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] There are still the masterminds... 
  [Enriquez] That is what Helen Mack says, right? If we follow 
that line of thinking, all of a sudden [former President] 
Vinicio Cerezo will have to go to jail because he was the 
leader. I would have to go to trial if anything happens 
anywhere and a soldier is to blame. That should not be so. 
  In this case, a person has already been tried. I do not 
think 
he was following orders because if he had been, he would have 
said so a long time ago. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Let's talk about your views on the 
agenda. What are the most important topics, and which are the 
most likely to be sticking points? 
  [Enriquez] The truth commission is important, but that issue 
is now separate from human rights. The most important issues 
are the strengthening of civilian power, the role of the 
military in a democracy, and the land issue. I think the land 
issue will be a difficult one. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What about the constitutional reforms 
being discussed at the negotiating table? 
  [Enriquez] That is the third most important issue. We have 
tried to probe a little into the changes they are seeking 
because the URNG says the Constitution is antisubversive. 
  They may want to make many changes, and of course they are 
not going to have a large enough presence at the national 
constituent assembly to make them. That could pose a serious 
problem. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Could the land reform issue be a part of 
the agreements, or would it have to discussed at the constituent 
assembly? 
  [Enriquez] This must be dealt with constitutionally because 
private property is expressly recognized in the Constitution. 
Furthermore, the talks are between the government and the URNG, 
which means the legislative and judicial branches have no say in 
the negotiations. 
  The only thing the government can do with its legislative 
powers is promote action in that direction. It cannot offer or 
guarantee that this or that will be done, because approval or 
rejection of any reform falls under the authority of other 
branches of government. 
  The URNG wants to change the Constitution, including the 
Army's mission. Apparently they want to remove the clause on 
domestic security, so the final decision belongs to the 
constituent assembly, not the executive branch. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Would the next issue be the Indians? 
  [Enriquez] We focus a lot of attention on that issue because 
it is a significant problem in our society. It is easily 
exploited by those who are talented at making the best of 
contradictions. 
  While it is true that the indigenous communities in our 
country have lived -- or have been forced to live -- apart from 
the rest of society, I do not believe it is part of a policy 
promoted by the government or the Coordinating Committee for 
Agricultural, Commercial, Financial, and Industrial Associations 
[CACIF]. What worries us is the fact that they have become 
quite ideological. 
  These are the most important issues. Once we manage to 
overcome the military issue and the other more difficult 
matters, once I hear the URNG say "cease fire," then I can say 
we are going to attain peace. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What is your opinion of the behavior of 
all the other sectors of our community regarding the peace 
process? 
  [Enriquez] As of just recently, I would say it has primarily 
been indifference. It was as if the people really believed that 
the only two players were the guerrillas and the Army, like you 
said before, and that everything would end when they decided to 
stop fighting. Period. That is really not the way it is. 
  I find that they have become more aware and now realize that 
the subversive attacks were directed at the government and the 
system in Guatemala with the objective of completely changing 
everything. They know now that the Army, as the nation's armed 
force and legitimate defender of the Guatemalan State, was 
obliged to fight them. That is precisely what we have done. We 
have carried out our mission, and we are determined to 
accomplish it. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What is your opinion about the political 
sector? 
  [Enriquez] The only thing I can say about the political 
sector is that I hope the parties grow stronger and, as rightful 
institutions, they meet the people's expectations for the coming 
elections. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Do you mean growing stronger in their 
present form? 
  [Enriquez] When I say grow stronger, I mean I hope the 
members choose their leaders wisely. If they do, they will not 
have to regret it later and say that their leaders did not meet 
the expectations they created. 
  Now there are elections for deputies, and the general 
elections are almost here. The people must think carefully 
about who they will vote for. If they do not, we are going to 
see the same problems all over again and it will be the voters' 
fault alone. We do not vote. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] What can you say about the politicians' 
participation in the peace process? 
  [Enriquez] Their contribution is almost imperceptible. 
There were representatives from the political parties when the 
talks began, but they gradually disappeared. Lately the 
politicians have said nothing about peace or a cease fire. The 
media has been bolder in writing about these issues. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] There is light at the end of the tunnel 
now 
that the Human Rights Agreement has been signed. Many feel it 
is the beginning of peace. Objectively speaking, how realistic 
is it to hope for peace in the next few months? 
  [Enriquez] I do see light at the end of the tunnel; so much 
so that I, as defense minister, would dare express my honest 
enthusiasm and delight about the Human Rights Agreements. 
  The agreements not only bring international verification, 
which is a firm step toward peace, but they also include a 
statement by the government and the URNG of their willingness to 
attain peace in December, before the end of the year. 
  If there is no political willingness, however, it is logical 
to conclude that the talks will grind to a halt. That is also 
true. Nevertheless, I do not believe that any further delay 
would benefit anyone, not even the URNG. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Based on what you believe will happen, not 
on what you would like to see, would you venture to say that a 
peace agreement will be signed in December? 
  [Enriquez] If you ask me what I would like to see, then I 
say yes, I hope peace can be signed in December or earlier. If 
you ask me what I think will happen, I would have to say that 
when I was overly optimistic in the past, I was disappointed. I 
would rather not be so optimistic this time. I think the peace 
talks could go on into part of next year. 
  [SIGLO VEINTIUNO] Where could the stalemate arise? 
  [Enriquez] Practically everything is behind schedule. They 
were supposed to start talking about the displaced persons on 8 
May, but they have postponed that until 21 or 24 May. There you 
have a fortnight already, and they will surely postpone other 
issues. 
  I am sure they will encounter obstacles on some issues. I 
only wish it were a matter of saying: "This is as far as we can 
go." Then they could go on the record as saying that the URNG 
wants this or that and the government wants that and the other. 
But that is not the way it works. They prefer to go on 
fighting over each issue.

  [Text] Chetumal, 17 May (NOTIMEX) -- Francisco Chop Chomo, 
representative of the Permanent Commissions for Refugees, 
indicated that some 220 Guatemalan refugees, who had settled in 
the southeastern Mexican State of Quintana Roo, today returned 
to Guatemala by plane. 
  Chop Chomo noted that the first Hercules plane flight 
departed at 1210 local time, while the second flight departed at 
1600 local time en route to Playa Grande, Guatemala. Chop Chomo 
added that the third flight scheduled for 17 May was canceled 
due to mechanical failure. Another 360 Guatemalans are expected 
to return 18 May on two more flights, one at 0900 and another at 
1300 local time. 
  Chop Chomo said that representatives of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] and the Mexican Commission for 
Aid to Refugees accompanied the refugees to the airport of Playa 
Grande. He indicated that the Guatemalan Army refuses to allow 
international observers to accompany the refugees until they 
reach Pueblo Nuevo, Mayalan, and Santa Maria Tzeja, where 
returning refugees will settle. 
  According to UNHCR reports, 1,717 Guatemalan refugees will 
return voluntarily to their country by plane from 13 to 19 May. 
This operation constitutes the fourth collective return since 20 
January 1993 when some 2,500 Guatemalans returned to their 
country and the first returned by plane. Some 43,000 Guatemalan 
refugees have lived in camps in southeastern Mexico since the 
early 1980's, when they began fleeing from attacks by the 
Guatemalan Army. 
  Meanwhile, Gilberto Ocana Mendez, prison director in Chiapas 
State, announced that four of the 42 inmates, who began a hunger 
strike on 16 May, suspended the action following the promise 
that they would be returned to their country. 
  Guatemalan nationals Alfonso Gabriel Mendez, Juan Lopez 
Ramirez, Nicolas Vasquez Gabriel, and Marcos Prez Sanchez were 
arrested after being charged with violating the General 
Population Law of Mexico. Guatemalan Consul in Chetumal Jose 
Ignacio Salan Casados visited the inmates to tell them that 
within hours they would be returning to Colotenango, a community 
in the northwestern Guatemalan Department of Huehuetenango.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 18 May (EFE) -- Today, the party of 
Joaquin Balaguer, current president and candidate for 
reelection, described as "insolent" the Socialist International 
(SI) observers who attended Monday's elections. On a television 
program, Angel Lockward, spokesman of Balaguer's Social 
Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), criticized Chilean Luis Ayala, 
president of the SI, who last night described the irregularities 
observed in the general elections as "grave and serious." 
Lockward criticized the lack of respect shown by "some 
foreigners" and said that "none of them have the right to meddle 
in local politics." 
  The PRSC indicated that the SI observers were invited by the 
social democratic Dominican Revolutionary Party of Jose 
Francisco Pena Gomez, the main opposition candidate. He added 
that the observers his party invited have remained respectful, 
without making statements.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 18 May (EFE) -- The 27 OAS observers 
who witnessed the 16 May elections in the Dominican Republic 
said today that they detected irregularities and that many 
citizens were not able to vote. 
  The OAS report stated that "in several municipalities, 
citizens who had their identification cards could not vote due 
to irregularities in the official voters lists." In other 
words, the names of those citizens were not in the electoral 
register previously delivered to the political parties. The 
report added: "The OAS electoral mission, along with two other 
international delegations, immediately presented this serious 
concern to the Central Electoral Board (JCE) authorities. At 
the moment, we are not in a position to evaluate the magnitude 
or the implications of the irregularities in the electoral 
register." 
  The OAS observers hope the Dominican authorities will make 
an 
effort to determine "the identity of the persons responsible for 
the irregularities in the electoral registry." Finally, the OAS 
stressed "the preliminary status of the observations. Several 
members of the electoral mission will remain in the Dominican 
Republic to prepare a final report to be presented to the OAS 
Permanent Council as soon as possible." 
  Prior to the report's issuance, representatives from the 
U.S. National Democratic Institute for Foreign Affairs and 
members of Socialist International, SI, made similar 
observations, expressed in even stronger terms. A spokesman for 
President Ballaguer's Social Christian Reformist Party today 
described the SI observers as "insolent," adding that "none of 
them have any right to meddle in our national politics."

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 18 May (EFE) -- Jose Francisco Pena 
Gomez, leader of the opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party 
(PRD), which has made accusations of fraud in Monday's 
elections, said today that it has "a civilian army" to see that 
the "people's votes are not mocked." 
  "We do not accept the results" of the Central Electoral 
Board 
[JCE], which gives a small margin to President Joaquin Balaguer, 
Pena Gomez said on a television program during which he 
requested "a vote count tally sheet by tally sheet." He also 
reiterated statements he made during the 1990 elections, when he 
said: "We must prove fraud before we call for violence."

<F P=106> [By Ramon Melenciano] </F>
  [Text] Santo Domingo, 18 May (EFE) -- Jose Francisco Pena 
Gomez, who claims that electoral fraud was perpetrated in 
Monday's elections, today asked his party activists to remain 
calm. His party, the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD, social 
democrat), demands President Joaquin Balaguer "relinquish power." 
  "We will not push the people to their death....we will fight 
with all peaceful means" the alleged victory of his party, Pena 
Gomez said. He also said that if the Central Electoral Board 
(JCE) continues to tally the votes and proclaims Balaguer the 
winner, the victory will not be valid. 
  The PRD leader today challenged the impartiality of two of 
the judges who comprise the electoral tribunal as part of his 
efforts to have the JCE recount the votes and recognize that his 
party won the elections. Pena Gomez requested Leonardo Matos 
Berrido and Jose Henriquez Almanzar be disqualified for their 
alleged acts of corruption, in which he also implicates the JCE 
and the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), which supports 
President Balaguer. 
  The two electoral judges, proposed by the ruling PRSC, must 
relinquish their posts to their substitutes until the other 
members decide whether the request for disqualification is valid. 
  "The country has been robbed," Pena Gomez stated, justifying 
his charges that there were more ballots than voters in some 
towns. He explained that the JCE must again tally the null and 
"disputed" votes (subject to an embargo due to suspicions) to 
settle the situation. According to him, these votes include 
valid ones that would benefit the PRD. 
  He said the tally of null and disputed votes must be 
directly 
supervised by OAS, International Electoral System Foundation 
(IFES), and Electoral Advice and Promotion Center (CAPEL) 
observers. Pena Gomez believes these same observers should 
participate in a revision of the tally sheets, which correspond 
to electoral tables whose annulment the PRD has requested 
because of a modification of the voters' lists. He reported 
that computer diskettes delivered to the JCE with the tally 
sheet information do not coincide with the information announced 
by the electoral organization. 
  According to Pena Gomez, the situation occurs because the 
JCE's computer center is altering the tally sheet information to 
the detriment of his party. He claimed that JCE personnel added 
38,000 votes that did not belong to the PRSC, and he also 
reported that the military seized four Municipal Electoral 
Boards and no one knows what happened to their tally sheets. 
Pena Gomez said the military still controls the boards in El 
Seibo, Moca, Samana, and Elias Pina. 
  Police and military surveillance around PRD facilities 
located in downtown Santo Domingo increased considerably while 
Pena Gomez gave his statements. Although the presidential 
candidate asked hundreds of followers to remain calm, they 
demanded to go out and "fight for their victory." 
  Nevertheless, Pena Gomez said that he wants no deaths and 
that he does not want "to disrupt the country's peace" with an 
uprising by his activists. PRD activists gathered in front of 
PRD facilities and shouted several slogans: "Get out, get out, 
Balaguer"; "We will repeat the April war"; and "If they do not 
relinquish (power) to us, there will be trouble."

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 18 May (DPA)-- The Dominican 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) political commission has initiated 
legal steps to challenge Monday's general election results. 
  A PRD delegation and a delegation from the Santo Domingo 
Accord lodged an appeal this morning in the predawn hours with 
the Central Electoral Board [JCE] requesting the vote count be 
stopped, no more bulletins be released, and no winners be 
declared in this election. The appeal to the JCE also demands a 
new vote tally sheet count. 
  The Santo Domingo Accord is the name of the alliance that 
nominated Jose Francisco Pena Gomez for president and Fernando 
Alvarez Bogaert for vice president. 
  The PRD says there were serious discrepancies in these 
elections ranging from switched voter lists to an illegal 
increase in the number of voting tables at some polling centers. 
The PRD also claims there are discrepancies between the numbers 
published in public bulletins and those on diskettes [preceding 
word in English] distributed to the parties. 
  The JCE scheduled a meeting for this afternoon to evaluate 
the PRD's claims, particularly the alleged list irregularities 
and the results given. 
  The last JCE bulletin shows Joaquin Balaguer ahead with 
42.76 
percent of the votes counted. Pena Gomez is in second place 
with 40.95 percent. These results are for 80 percent of the 
electoral tables throughout the country.

  [Excerpts] Santo Domingo, 18 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, 
Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer announced he would accept 
holding supplementary elections in the provinces where it can be 
proven dishonest actions took place. The 87-year-old chief of 
state pointed out "he would accept holding these special 
elections in those places where irregularities took place, but 
the Central Electoral Board (JCE) must organize them." 
  Balaguer, the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) 
presidential candidate, declared himself the winner of the 16 
May elections, but the opposition claimed there were 
irregularities during the elections. Expecting to begin his 
seventh term at 87, on 17 May, the almost blind president denied 
there was fraud and maintained the elections were honest. 
[passage omitted] 
  Today, the JCE suspended issuing the bulletin that would 
make 
public the name of the winner of the general elections in order 
to analyze the PRD [Dominican Revolutionary Party] allegations 
of fraud. A PRD delegation delivered the vote challenge to the 
JCE. According to a JCE spokesman, it will take "pertinent" time 
to give an opinion on the opposition's charge and petition, but 
will make a ruling on 19 May at the latest. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 18 May (AFP) -- Provisional 
President Emile Jonassaint (who is not recognized by the 
international community) asked Haitians on Wednesday to rally 
around the national flag and reconcile themselves "as brothers 
of the same nation." 
  In a radio and television message broadcast to the nation on 
18 May on the occasion of Flag Day and of the University of 
Haiti [as received], Jonassaint said the "union of the (Haitian) 
people is as necessary now as it was during the conquest for 
independence." He also urged Haitians, at a time when 
"consciences are being manipulated, to receive the legacy of our 
ancestors" and "hoist the flag before the people" and "protect 
its honor." 
  Prime Minister Robert Malval, who was forced to resign (and 
is recognized by the international community), asked students 
earlier at the same celebration not to allow "force to be more 
important than the law." Malval, in the presence of the 
diplomatic corps that went to his house to offer support, 
reiterated (?his rejection of) Jonassaint's "illegal" regime.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 18 May (EFE) -- Today, 
Constitutional Prime Minister Robert Malval urged Haitian 
university students to continue the struggle to preserve 
democratic achievements and to defeat conservative forces. 
  Meanwhile, in a radio and television message, de facto 
President Emile Jonassaint called for Haitian unity. Malval and 
Jonassaint spoke on separate occasions during the celebrations 
to mark University and Flag Day. According to Jonassaint, this 
unity is as important "as the unity that led to the creation of 
the flag on 18 May 1803." 
  The U.S., Venezuelan, Taiwan, and Mexican ambassadors, the 
Canadian and French charges d'affaires, and the Papal Nuncio met 
with Malval at his Chante Brise home to express their support. 
In statements to journalists, the diplomats noted that their 
presence at Malval's home clearly expresses their rejection of 
the "supposed" de facto government and their support for 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown on 30 
September 1991 by a military group led by General Raoul Cedras. 
The diplomats added that Aristide and Malval represent the 
constitutional legitimacy of Haiti.

  [Text] More job losses in the pipeline for Trinidad and 
Tobago, this time at (Petrotrin). Chief executive officer (Keith 
Owah) says the company's wage bill must be reduced from 47 
percent of the company's operating costs to at least 35 percent. 
(Petrotrin) was formed last year by a merger of (Trintopec) and 
(Trintoc), and the new management is seeking to divest the 
nonpetroleum assets of the two companies. (Nicole Huggins) tells 
us more in this dispatch: 
  [Begin recording] [(Huggins)] The refining operations of 
(Petrotrin) have lost as much as $15 million annually over the 
past seven years. Output stands at less than 50 percent 
capacity, and with international oil prices expected to remain 
soft -- between $15 and $17 per barrel -- (Patten C.U. Keith 
Owah) sums up the company's strategic plan in one word: 
survival. Part of the plan is the sale of the Point Fortin 
refinery. Mr. (Owah) says there have already been informal 
statements of interest, but serious offers are expected, maybe 
by the end of the month. Most refineries are running on 
technology that is 30 years old, but Mr. (Owah) says he is 
fairly optimistic that an interested party will be found. 
  [(Owah)] In South America, you have countries with surplus 
crude and no adequate refining capability. Even in North 
America, you may find people, who are importing crude to process 
in the U.S., who might find Trinidad a good geographical 
location to begin investing in upgrading a refinery. So the 
point is that even though it is an old refinery, it is 
relatively safe in terms of refinery configuration. There is a 
good base on which to build an upgraded refinery. 
  [(Huggins)] The company is also looking at divesting the 
nonetroleum assets of (Trintoc) and (Trintopec), from catering 
services and hospitals to agricultural holdings. The 
Point-a-Pierre refinery is in the process of being upgraded, at 
a cost of TT $1.5 billion, and a venture partner is now being 
sought. 
  [(Owah)] I do not think today, we can say exatly what form 
that alliance will take, but it could be from one extreme -- an 
equity partner -- to another extreme, where you simply have an 
alliance with someone providing raw material and (?taking 
product), and that kind of thing. Our objective is to minimize 
our risk. 
  [(Huggins)] The upgrade is scheduled for completion by the 
first quarter of 1996, at least. The divestment of assets and 
the restructuring of the company are expected to lead to further 
cuts in the workforce over 1994-95, and those who remain may not 
have to accept much less, but will have to produce much more.

  [Text] Here in Mexico, there are many reactions to the bill 
sent to the U.S. Congress by Democrats David Bornier [name as 
heard] and Robert Torricelli. The bill states, among other 
things, that the U.S. Congress should support political reforms 
in Mexico in view of the upcoming 21 August elections. The two 
Democrats also proposed the presence of international observers. 
I repeat, this bill has sparked a number of reactions in Mexico 
by Mexican senators, Congress leader Maria de los Angeles 
Moreno, and Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo. Elvia Moreno 
has the story: 
  [Begin recording] [Moreno] Government Secretary Carpizo 
today 
rejected the idea of foreign intervention in Mexico's internal 
affairs by saying only Mexicans will manage and supervise the 21 
August federal elections. He was interviewed after he opened 
the Radio Broadcasting Commission Production Center of the 
Federal Electoral Institute [IFE]. The center was designed to 
support political parties in their mission to broadcast and 
spread the political culture. He stressed the following: 
  [Carpizo] As a Mexican, I reject any foreign intervention in 
Mexico's internal affairs. As for the elections, it is very 
clear that only Mexicans will manage and supervise the electoral 
process. We will let no foreigner intervene for any reason 
whatsoever. I am sure we Mexicans are united on this, for we 
believe in sovereignty and nationalism. The only thing these 
U.S. congressmen will achieve is to unite us even further. The 
final outcome will be that all Mexicans, as one entity, will not 
accept any interventionist principle. 
  [Moreno] This is how the government secretary replied to the 
interventionist attempt by two U.S. Democrats to observe the 
Mexican electoral process. 
  As for the debate on electoral registers between Samuel Del 
Villar, representative of the Party of the Democratic Revolution 
at the IFE, and Carlos Almada, Federal Voters Registry director 
general, Secretary Carpizo pointed out that the interest shown 
by Mexicans on the electoral lists reveals the citizens' 
determination to be better acquainted with electoral issues. 
  Carpizo also noted that the National Radio and Television 
Chamber is in charge of making the technical preparations to 
hold the electoral registry debate, whose date and place have 
yet to be determined. [end recording]

  [Text] Mexico City, 18 May (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican legislators 
today condemned U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposal to create 
a multinational force in Latin America and invade Haiti, to 
expel the military who rule that country. 
  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Deputy Ramon Mota 
Sanchez, chairman of the National Defense Committee, said Mexico 
remains firm in its foreign policy, which considers inviolate 
the self-determination of nations and the principle or 
nonintervention. "I totally and absolutely disagree with a 
proposal of this magnitude because it only shows us a 
manifestation of the policy traditionally maintained by that 
country, which pretends to act as an older brother" in Latin 
America. He demanded that the neighboring northern country's 
attitude be stopped "once and for all," and he expressed his 
confidence that the firm and invariable Mexican position will be 
stated in Mexico and various international forums. 
  Gabriel Jimenez Remus, parliamentary coordinator of the 
opposition National Action Party (PAN), said it was absurd that 
Clinton issued a proposal of this magnitude and, worse yet, is 
trying to get Mexico to support him." He emphasized that Mexico 
"has a firm policy on this issue and, therefore, all PAN members 
and federal deputies condemn this request, which only proves 
that this country insists on becoming judge or arbitrator of 
everything that occurs in the world, particularly in Latin 
America." 
  Ricardo Valero Recio Becerra, coordinator of the opposition 
Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), said his party will in 
no way support such a petition. Valero, who is also secretary 
of the Lower Chamber's Foreign Affairs Committee, said the U.S. 
policy "is no longer fit for our times." He added: 
Nevertheless, it reminds us of the Inter-American Peace Force 
that was created in the 1960's and whose activities were very 
dangerous for the region. He considered it worrisome that the 
United States make such a proposal given the situation of 
uncertainty which prevails in Haiti and which shall undoubtedly 
affect the region's stability. 
  The U.S. Government, through its Department of State, has 
asked Latin American nations to endorse an armed action on the 
Caribbean island, to replace the Haitian military government, 
but apparently only Uruguay and Argentina have endorsed the 
proposal.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] We are still in contact with Jesus Casasola, who 
this morning covered a number of military maneuvers and 
activities carried out by the National Defense Secretariat in 
the presence of journalists. During the activities, Division 
General Antonio Riviello Bazan, Mexican national defense 
secretary, said the Mexican State does not intend to repress 
public demonstrations with the newly purchased water cannons, 
referring to the famous Cobra vehicles that have been so 
severely criticized. Defense Secretary Riviello Bazan said that 
if public peace is threatened, this equipment will be used. Go 
ahead, Jesus, we are listening. 
  [Casasola] Here again, Pepe, I want to mention that it is 
not 
the government's decision to suppress any public demonstration. 
If the social well-being is threatened by the presence of 
violent groups, however, the riot equipment recently purchased 
by the National Defense Secretariat will be used. This is the 
warning National Defense Secretary Antonio Riviello Bazan made 
today. In a news conference held in the San Miguel de los 
(Agueyes) Military Base in Huehuetoca Muncipality, Mexico State, 
he pointed out that the 24 armored vehicles cost $100,000 each. 
He added that they will be used only when state officials who 
are confronted by violent groups require their use. Here are 
the defense secretary's words: 
  [Begin Riviello Bazan recording] If we had to intervene, 
this 
equipment causes no more harm than getting wet. Anyway, we feel 
it has not been well received by the public, but the Army has to 
take precautions. This is a precaution. If the public, 
however, wants us to remove the water cannons and replace them 
with 105mm cannons, then we will replace them. [laughter] Yes, 
there are two; we are talking about two different types. One is 
the riot cannon, the other is not precisely for that purpose. 
You can see the government does not intend to prevent any 
public demonstration. It is not up to the National Defense 
Secretariat. It is up to the proper civilian authorities to 
make a request through the Government Secretariat and, in the 
last instance, the president gives the authorization. We are 
not autonomous. [end recording] 
  [Casasola] Antonio Riviello Bazan reiterated that the 
purchase of the riot equipment is part of a plan to upgrade the 
Army's equipment, since it has equipment which dates back to 
1942. Jokingly, he said: This is a good opportunity for anyone 
who wants to buy antique cars. 
  He also spoke about the State of Chiapas case, indicating 
that the National Defense Secretariat is currently analyzing two 
recommendations made by the National Human Rights Commission. 
Concerning the current conflict in this state, he added: 
  [Begin Riviello Bazan recording, in progress] ...in a state 
of alert by the Armed Forces. We are determined to continue 
supporting the government's efforts. [end recording] 
  [Casasola] As for the elections, the national defense 
secretary said the Mexican Army will participate in the security 
and transportation of the electoral ballots. On the recent 
creation of the National Commission of Public Security, he said 
his department is not subordinate to anyone. 
  After the news conference some members of the media were 
invited to a military demonstration in which live ammunition was 
used.

<F P=106> [Speech by General Humberto Ortega, commander in chief of </F>
the Sandinist People's Army, at the National Unity Room of the 
Presidential House in Managua; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] ...President of the Republic of Nicaragua, special 
guests, national and international media, Nicaraguan people: 
  As the president of the Republic has said, today we are 
concluding a period of hard work, during which we faced moments 
of tension. Basically, however, it was a period during which we 
learned a lot. 
  For all of us, today is a very important day. If we learned 
anything from this joint effort to give Nicaragua the national 
army our people have desired this century, it is that we cannot 
take these steps and accomplish these goals unless we work 
responsibly and with a spirit of unity and reconciliation, 
despite the difficulties. I believe this was the most important 
thing we learned during the period [four-second break in 
reception] President Chamorro [3-second break in reception] the 
commanders here present have learned. 
  Understanding is vital at this crucial time for Nicaragua's 
future; it is vital to eliminate the climate of conflict, it is 
vital to give ourselves an opportunity to show that we want to 
understand each other; we must show our good faith and our 
willingness to help Nicaragua. In that manner, we will bury 
once and for all the climate of mistrust that prevents us from 
taking the first step to build the national unity the majority 
of the Nicaraguan people so earnestly need. The Nicaraguan 
people are currently suffering the poverty resulting from more 
than a century of underdevelopment, backwardness, war, and 
misunderstandings. In sum, the Nicaraguan people have travelled 
down a very difficult path [words indistinct] at this time when 
other personalities such as Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, 
Pablo Antonio Cuadra, and I have been trying to find venues of 
understanding, when only a few months ago some of us were 
receiving pensions. 
  I therefore believe these steps show that it is possible to 
get together and reach an understanding; to join efforts and 
attain specific results. This is what the Nicaraguan people 
expect from their leaders and authorities. 
  Today, on behalf of the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] I want 
to say that soon, through the Code of Military Organization, 
Jurisdiction, and Social Welfare, the EPS will become the 
national army we all want. It will be an army that, based on 
the necessary constitutional amendments, will have a name 
consonant with the new phase, while its current name will be 
historically recorded as an example [word indistinct] of its 
fundamental and patriotic values. 
  I believe that with the steps and actions we have taken we 
will truly help our fatherland move ahead. Thank you. [applause]

  [Text] Managua, 18 May (NOTIMEX) -- An official source has 
reported that Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro today 
contacted former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez to 
express her solidarity with him. A Presidency document states 
"Chamorro contacted Perez this morning to express her solidarity 
with and fondness for him." 
  The Venezuelan Supreme Court of Justice issued today in 
Caracas an arrest warrant for the former president as part of 
his trial for allegedly embezzling $17 million between 1989 and 
1992. The Presidency communique recalled a message by Perez in 
which he said he "never" embezzled the secret $17 million fund, 
part of which reportedly was transferred to the current 
Nicaraguan Government to "reinforce democracy." Perez was 
impeached on 20 May 1993 when the Venezuelan court found 
sufficient evidence to try him for allegedly committing 
embezzlement. 
  Chamorro recently deemed the allegation that Perez 
financially supported her government "false," but she 
acknowledged the efforts of the former president to "defuse the 
spiral of warlike tension in Central America."

  [Text] "Recontra" Chiefs Jose Santos Rodriguez, alias 
"Cascabel," and Julio Cesar Benavides, alias "Pajarillo," whose 
men seized Quilali last Saturday, will occupy the posts of 
delegate and deputy delegate of the Government Ministry in San 
Rafael del Norte, Jinotega, according to an agreement reached 
yesterday in a meeting between rebel leaders and Government 
Minister Alfredo Mendieta. 
  Ranking National Police chiefs will hold a Commanders 
Council 
today, to study the government measures, which have sparked a 
negative response in the police ranks. "How are we going to be 
subordinate to criminals?" asked a source close to the 
institution. 
  Sergio Caramagna Valinotti, chief of the Support and 
Verification Commission (CIAV-OAS), who was present at the 
meeting between the ministers and the "recontra" leaders, 
reported they had also agreed to allow 11 "recontra" chieftains 
to reenter the Walter Mendoza Academy next Friday. The 
chieftains had abandoned the academy "to protest" the dismissal 
of "Cascabel" and "Pajarillo" from the police forces. 
  Murderers and Criminals [subhead] 
  According to the Information and Study Office, the National 
Police expelled the recontras because they were criminals and 
had deserted the police ranks. Furthermore, it denied that 
those men would return as "the functions of policeman and 
criminal do not coincide." 
  According to police files, the men under "Cascabel" set fire 
to two motorcycles and are the ones who murdered Captain Miguel 
Guido Quiroz, First Lieutenant Jose Agurcia Garcia, and soldiers 
Antonio Castillo Perez and Andres Zuniga, among other crimes. 
  Mendieta explained that the recontras who will reenter the 
forces will work at police stations in the northern part of the 
country and said it had been a "very satisfactory" meeting as it 
showed how Nicaragua had advanced to solve problems "peacefully 
and through dialogue." The meeting was not attended by any 
National Police representative. The meeting was held on the 
fifth floor of the Silvio Mayorga Building at 1100 yesterday 
morning. The recontras used Minister Mendieta's private 
elevator to get to the meeting. 
  Present at the meeting were Deputy Government Ministers 
Frank 
Cesar and Joaquin Lovo; Jose Angel Talavera, alias "Chacal," and 
his brother Esteban; and Mateo Guerrero, president of the 
Nicaraguan Human Rights Association (ANPDH). The members of the 
FN-3-80 [3-80 Northern Front] traveled to Managua expressly to 
meet with government officials after the recontras refused to 
talk with El Jicaro Police Chief Subcommander Marcos Ruiz last 
Sunday, to find a solution to the conflict. 
  Military sources have confirmed that the seizing of Quilali 
had been peaceful and that the rebels had not used weapons. The 
recontras held the town's main entry and exit points and the 
offices of Telcor, the municipality, the Agricultural and 
Livestock Ministry, and Ecodepa [expansion not known].

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergio Ramirez, Sandinist faction leader in </F>
the Nicaraguan National Assembly, by an unidentified reporter on 
the "Impact 620" program; monitored in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] ...that blame the Sandinists for the 
property situation in Nicaragua. A short while ago Daniel 
Ortega said he would return his house, but only to an 
organization dealing with the handicapped or to some sort of 
workers' movement, not to its original owner. Will the congress 
discuss the property issue? As a faction leader in the national 
parliament, you have studied the property problem. 
  [Ramirez] This is not on the congress' agenda. We will only 
discuss our political program, changes to our statutes, and the 
election of our authorities. 
  The property issue is of course on the National Assembly's 
agenda. As soon as we are through with the congress, I plan to 
look into this pending matter and what we call the Last Word on 
Property Law [Ley de Punto Final de la Propiedad], which are a 
group of laws, not just one law. We are going to propose in the 
National Assembly a law that deals with agricultural 
cooperatives, their land deeds or titles; a law that serves to 
regulate and protect workers' propriety rights, both in the city 
as well as in the fields; a law that will be called the property 
stabilization or property stability law; plus a revaluation law 
covering bonds that belong to those whose property was 
confiscated. I believe that this package of laws will help us 
resolve this very complicated property issue, which has no 
single solution, but instead several solutions. 
  My thoughts on this matter are that although some people 
were 
treated unfairly, there are others -- which the government 
itself admits -- whose property was confiscated fairly, for 
example the property belonging to the Somozas and those close to 
them. The finance minister has said that those whose properties 
were affected becasue of their ties to the Somoza regime will 
not be entitled to any sort of return. There were other types 
of property reviews where obviously some people were treated 
unfairly. Nevetherless, that same property may have been 
occupied for 15 years by a cooperative, and no one would even 
consider evicting them, removing them to put someone else in 
their place. What the state has to do in such cases is to 
compensate these people. This has been done with bonds. The 
problem is that these bonds are not worth enough to satisfy the 
people who receive them, so now we will propose in the National 
Assembly a law to revalue these bonds and make them good for 
paying taxes and bank debts, for purchasing privatized 
corporations, and/or conducting various financial market 
operations. This will ensure that people who receive these bonds 
will feel more satisfied. 
  There are also property disputes that need to be discussed 
in 
the courts and not simply resolved by administrative rulings. 
The idea is to find stability, not at the expense of someone 
else or by a sector of the people -- the poorest, the less 
fortunate -- instead, that this be accomplished through fairness 
and justice. 
  [Reporter] Going back to the topic of Sandinist trends and 
with this special congress in mind, there are so many things, 
opinions, points of view on the FSLN. However, speaking of the 
trend that wants Sandinism to return to become a majority party, 
what would be the FSLN platform, guideline, or alternative for 
ensuring the return of Sandinism? 
  [Ramirez] First, we need a true political party. When I say 
a true political party I mean a party that does not fear voters. 
It was precisely in the 1987 Constitution, which was voted on 
when there was a Sandinist majority, where the succession of 
power was established through elections. In order for a party 
to return to power in Nicaragua or gain power, it has to win the 
elections through votes. This party has to therefore practice 
electoral proselytism. Some comrades in the party are a bit 
embarrassed -- I say because of ideological prejudice -- at this 
electoral nature that Sandinism must have. I am not saying that 
Sandinism should only be active during national election 
periods. I do not believe in parties that remain dormant for 
six years and when election time comes they awaken -- these are 
electioneering parties. A party that stops defending those in 
our society who have the least -- the most humble, the less 
fortunate, the jobless, peasants without land or those under 
threat of eviction -- is a party that wants to regain political 
power through the control of land, Nicaragua's traditional means 
of political control. This also holds true for those who use 
small and medium-sized businesses to promote themselves. 
Sandinism must conduct constant political work to make people 
aware of their rights, their interests. This is what I mean 
when I speak of revolutionary parties that always work for the 
benefit of the great majorities -- those who have the least, 
without discriminating against other sectors of society. 
  But, at the same time, thinking that a political party that 
believes its duty is to defend the interests of the vast 
majority and that it has to struggle every day for the interests 
of all sectors, the best way to watch over those interests is to 
put this in practice from a position of power, not from the 
opposition. Therefore, one must be part of the government and 
to become part of the government one must win the votes. It 
must be realized that a political party does not win the 
majority of votes until such time as a person enters the voting 
booth behind a curtain to cast his vote for a specific party. 
If the voter is not convinced at that time that he is voting 
for something, if previously he has not received the true 
message of expectation for the return of lost hopes, we will 
never obtain the majority of votes we need to return to power. 
We will not achieve this if we do not have a true, credible, 
and loyal message. I believe we have to go out and send the 
message again. 
  [Reporter] You have been described as a moderate. It is said 
that if one is moderate, one is not belligerent. To say, for 
example, that the FSLN's action in support of the workers' 
gains, or support for the true problems within society, or for 
economic problems, or to go out into the streets to stage a 
strike -- that to a certain extent this harms the nation's 
development -- well, if this is not being belligerent then it 
would be best to sit behind a desk and give orders instead of 
going out to the streets. What is your point of view on this? 
Do you think that to be belligerent, everyday actions must be 
taken into account? 
  [Ramirez] I know every inch of this country; I have been in 
many places throughout these 15 years. I have talked with all 
sectors; I have visited the most remote municipalities in the 
nation. I believe I understand the people's way of thinking. 
If someone asks me to interpret the feelings of the Nicaraguan 
people about the Legislative Assembly, or whether the people 
want war or violence -- in my opinion, this is not the type of 
belligerence that the people want. Given the enormous economic 
crisis, with such a high rate of unemployment -- in the 
countryside, in the poor Managua neighborhoods -- what the 
people want is an opportunity to work. They want peace. They do 
not want to use weapons anymore. They do not want any more 
deaths. They do not want any more kidnappings. In Matagalpa, in 
Jinotega, what the people want is security. Their security is 
threatened every day by armed criminal gangs who kidnap, rob, 
kill, block traffic on the road, force people out of buses to 
rob and assault them -- these people are armed for acts of 
revenge. What the people want is peace, security. They do not 
want any more war. This is what I interpret as my belligerence. 
My duty as a belligerent politician is to proclaim peace, but 
not peace with injustice. 
  Obviously I will never, never support someone who wants to 
recover his property by burning down the house, damaging the 
roof, poisoning the water supply so that cattle die, closing up 
the water wells -- as happened in a violent eviction on the 
outskirts of Leon. I can never agree with these acts of violence 
that the law must punish. What is sought is precisely that 
violence end, no matter its origin. We want to live in peace 
with security. The FSLN can't keep hailing violence just 
because certain sectors use violence; this would be a 
never-ending story. To the extent that we continue threatening 
the fragile peace the nation and the citizens are enjoying, with 
incorrect speeches, with violent speeches, calling for acts of 
revenge, we will not gain any votes; rather we will alienate 
them. These are my conclusions after my contacts with the 
Nicaraguan people, through my permanent dialogues with diverse 
sectors of society. This is why I reaffirm my conviction in my 
call for peace, call for reconciliation with justice, for a new 
society, for a democratic society in Nicaragua. This is what 
the people of Nicargua want. 
  [Reporter] How much truth is there in that within the FSLN, 
the rank and file will be taken into account [words indistinct] 
the communal movement, if only one sector of the society attends 
the assemblies -- if of course he is member of the FSLN. For 
example, in Masaya an assembly has just been held, where I 
understand Henry Ruiz participated. Some leaders did not attend 
that assembly because they belong to the faction, the other 
faction, that is. How can one side know the other's position 
[words indistinct] if they do not sit down [words indistinct] 
make a decision through a democratic process [words indistinct] 
reach a conclusion? Maybe a consensus can be reached for 
presentation at the congress on the 20th. You, as 
representatives of the Sandinist faction that represent the 
majority, do you invite all to the demonstrations, to meet and 
talk about the FSLN's internal crisis? 
  [Ramirez] Well, about this so-called faction, we know that 
this is a majority that is not an organized faction, it does not 
have authority, it does not have a leader, it does not have a 
structure within the nation. It does not seek to be a party 
parallel to the FSLN. The [passage indistinct] was elected, 
where 150 Sandinist signed an agreement whereby [words 
indistinct] were established. I do not see this as [passage 
indistinct] the radio, the author of the anthem. [passage 
indistinct] The document was signed by the majority. I do not 
see [words indistinct] with people such as Ernesto Cardenal, our 
national poet who signed this document. Also Mario Flores Ortiz 
could be summoned, the founder of psychiatry in the nation, of 
great prestige in the medical sector, and one of the senior 
socialists of Nicaragua. [Words indistinct] the names of the 
150 who signed the document, subsequently 500 more signed. 
There is a true tendency toward [words indistinct] that no one 
can disqualify. At this stage of the game to be calling as 
right wing the [words indistinct] Ernesto Cardenal or Mario 
Flores Ortiz, or [words indistinct], union leaders and all those 
socialists, is nothing more than nonsense. No one in this 
country believes in this type of language and in name calling. 
  [Words indistinct] we are not organized as a faction with a 
structure within the party. Therefore, everyone attends the 
meetings we call, debates have taken place as they should with 
the [words indistinct] if the current tendencies are correct 
this is discussed, if this is correct or not. I believe this is 
the proper way to wage a political debate. What has assembled 
us here in this process before the Congress, is the lack of the 
use of a democratic mechanism within the party. This results in 
serious mistakes being made. For example, there are two 
candidates for secretary general. The department heads, the 
political secretaries of the parties should be [word 
indistinct], both candidates should be given equal opportunities 
to appear before the national congress delegates, before the 
departmental congress delegates. They should be given the 
opportunity to talk to them. Otherwise, when a candidate goes 
to talk to an assembly, the others are not present because they 
might have been prohibited from attending. This is possible. 
Unclear mechanisms could be used to limit who attends. I 
believe this is a result of not practicing democracy. 
  From now on we should ensure there is more than one 
candidate 
for a public post from the FSLN ranks. There could be two, or 
three, or four candidates running for the same post. Now there 
are two, [words indistinct] could be more than two. They should 
be given the same opportunity to appear before FSLN audiences to 
present their own points of view. That is democracy. 
  [Reporter] Allow me, I do not know if in this case I am 
being 
naive [words indistinct], but talking a little about the reality 
that exists within the FSLN, [words indistinct] Carlos Mejia 
Godoy. When Carlos Mejia Godoy presented a composition written 
by Pablo Antonio Cuadra, it received harsh criticism. At the 
signing of [words indistinct] other document [words indistinct] 
the majority, were harshly criticized by the media. What is 
more, the same media that belong to the FSLN do not give space 
to persons who agreed with that position. So, do you believe 
that in the Congress this would be solved, or [words 
indistinct]? The truth is that they are not allowed to make use 
of the media. If they belong to the FSLN, undoubtedly the FSLN 
members should be allowed to use this media. What is your 
opinion on this? 
  [Ramirez] It would be difficult to respond in that same 
language [words indistinct], I will never fall into that trap. 
I believe that my duty is to speak in a lofty manner, to seek 
the consensus of all in the party, I will not respond to 
insults. I will not ask: Why are you insulting me, calling me 
right wing [passage indistinct], cannot sit with me at the same 
table, cannot be in the same party? I would be paving the way 
for my expulsion from the party. My duty is to be a Sandinist, 
my duty is to struggle within the ranks of my party, this is 
what I believe. I want my party to become a truly democratic 
force capable of winning the elections in 1996 and other 
elections in the future. I am going to struggle for a Sandinism 
that will [word indistinct] with Nicaraguan society, not a 
Sandinism that instills fear. I am going to struggle for a 
Sandinism in which true democratic forces can join to offer 
Nicaraguan society a true alternative of power in the nation. I 
want to struggle for a Sandinism that will not identify with 
irrational violent actions that are not the legitimate defense 
of the people, of the dispossessed, of this nation's majority. 
This is the Sandinism I want, this is why I am inside the 
Sandinist party. 
  I am not going to be scared off because they say Sergio 
Ramirez has identified himself with the rich sector. This is a 
gross lie and outright slander. I do not possess any fortune, 
nor do I have anything against those who possess fortunes. I 
believe it is legitimate within this society, to work in the 
field one wants, accumulate capital, if one is honest. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] what will happen after the 
Congress? 
  [Ramirez] I do not want to speak now about what will happen 
after the Congress. I think Sandinist unity should be sought. 
  I am in Sandinism because I believe in the majority. If I 
did not believe in the majority, I would be doing other things. 
I would have some business, a candy store, a shoe store, I would 
have apartments to rent, or a farm of 500 manzanas. I do not 
know what I would be doing if I did not feel that what I am 
doing in my party is politically right, because I want to turn 
my party into a winning force. We must defend the interests of 
the majority, which is what I believe in, and make that majority 
return to Sandinism. The truth is that the majority is not in 
Sandinism right now. The Sandinist Front is a minority party. 
That is what I believe. 
  [Reporter] This is "Impact 620." We are having problems with 
this line. Dr. Sergio Ramirez is here. I have three final 
questions. I had wanted to give listeners the opportunity to 
participate but due to the line problems, here are my questions 
which deal directly with the reality facing the Sandinist Front 
leaders in the National Directorate. 
  There are some who follow a slightly more modern line while 
others maintain a special position -- a position is respected. 
For example, in the case of Commander Daniel Ortega, he is not 
the only option for secretary general of the Sandinst Front. 
Before you arrived, other people called to ask you whether you 
think he is the only option in the effort to maintain the 
Sandinist Front Secretariat and coordinate the party's decisions 
within the conglomerate of the party congress. It is said that 
the decisions are made by the conglomerate, not by a single 
person. But this is not shown in practice. He wants to 
continue being the Sandinist Front secretary. He no longer 
wants to be candidate because it is too early to talk about 
presidential candidates. He wants to continue as secretary, but 
he does not give the other viewpoints and positions in the 
Sandinist Front a chance, and for some time those positions have 
not been accepted. There are also the media and properties 
owned by the Sandinist Front to keep the party functioning. But 
most of those properties are managed by the circle that supports 
Commander Daniel Ortega's line. What do you think about this? 
If this continues in the next few months, there might really be 
a division within the Front. 
  [Ramirez] I think that Commander Daniel Ortega has every 
right to be a candidate for secretary general of the Sandinist 
Front. The Front's statutes do not prohibit reelection to the 
secretary generalship. Therefore, as a Sandinist Front 
militant, he has every right to be a candidate, just as 
Commander Henry Ruiz has every right. He has the same right to 
be a candidate for the secretary generalship and to be elected. 
They each have the right to address the Sandinist audience to 
attempt to show that each one is the best candidate and has the 
best proposal. The Sandinists have the right to hear them, to 
believe them or not. When the vote is held, congress delegates 
have the right to vote for one candidate or another. That is 
part of the democratic game in the Sandinist Front. Different 
candidates present themselves in pursuit of a position. Each 
promotes his candidacy, and congress delegates will vote 
secretly to elect the candidate of their choice. 
  Now then, if either of the two sides involved with these 
candidacies -- Commander Ruiz has his followers and Commander 
Daniel Ortega has his -- tries to disqualify the other, I think 
Commander Ruiz and Commander Ortega will be critical of those 
exclusions, discriminations, or disqualifications. I think that 
disqualifications would not help pave the way for unity in the 
Sandinist Front. 
  [Reporter] Now then, the Sandinist Front party is part of 
the 
Nicaraguan people, and the Nicaraguan people are experiencing a 
difficult economic situation. There is also the problem of the 
return of armed groups to civilian life. There is the issue of 
the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility], the economic 
situation, and the search for aid. The Paris Club meeting is 
approaching. Yesterday there was a meeting with representatives 
of donor countries. What viewpoints does the Sandinist Front on 
the economic problem and the involvement of all sectors, whether 
they be Sandinists or not? The Sandinist Front must also 
contribute. It is said that the Front has not contributed to 
improving the Nicaraguan people's economic situation. There are 
strikes and disturbances. There is a vertical command structure 
which does not permit a consensus in resolving economic 
problems. Criticisms are sometimes voiced in the parliament. 
What are the Sandinist Front's viewpoints on the country's 
economic situation? What about the ESAF? What can you tell us? 
  [Ramirez] I think the Sandinist Front was very critical of 
the ESAF. The Sandinist Front has said the ESAF does not 
fulfill the Nicaraguan people's expectations for profound change 
in the economic model. I agree with those criticisms. I 
obviously agree with the position that the ESAF does not satisfy 
the needs of the most abandoned sectors as participants in the 
economy. I would like an economic program that first helps the 
new owners of land, the cooperatives, the individual owners who 
were members of the resistance, Sandinists, demobilized Army 
soldiers, and demobilized members of the Government Ministry. 
Hundreds of thousands of manzanas have been distributed by the 
Sandinist revolution and the government of Mrs. Chamorro. They 
need credit, they need technical assistance, they need roads, 
they need markets, they need to begin to produce for the 
nation's benefit and that of thousands of peasant families that 
hold these lands and resources. Therefore, the economic program 
should be directed at favoring these emerging economic sectors. 
If we add up these thousands of producers and the thousands of 
manzanas they hold, we have there the actual production of food 
and agricultural products for the country. Therefore, there 
should be special plans for meeting the needs of these producers. 
  In terms of the economy, the country is not going to 
progress if only a minority benefits from the ESAF. I am not 
saying that this minority, which consists of large property 
owners and manufacturers, should be forgotten, but those 
thousands of small, medium-sized, and impoverished growers 
should also be taken into account. They are in dire need of low 
interest credit, technical assistance, seeds, and new markets 
for their products. Herein lies Nicaragua's future, among the 
small and medium-sized growers. I believe that the ESAF should 
be aimed at addressing the problems of this sector, and here I 
also include urban artisans, small and medium-sized businesses, 
and small industrial manufacturers. This sector includes the 
majority of the Nicaraguan people. Again, when I speak of a 
majority, I am referring to the term in the economic sense of 
benefits, not gratuities or giving away credit. I am not 
referring to that but saying that the time is ripe for the 
country's production to start to grow and for resources to be 
truly distributed. 
  [Words indistinct] Nicaragua to those who have less. We need 
an economic program that can result in a rapid drop in 
unemployment in Nicaragua. If every year we could produce 
10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 jobs, we would actually see the 
benefits and the population's living standards would improve. 
But all these problems like criminal activity, child abuse, and 
efforts by the police to control the exponential increase in 
criminal activity are caused by unemployment. In addition, 
instability in rural areas is caused by a lack of economic 
stability, lack of credit, unemployment. This is all related to 
the economic crisis in Nicaragua. 
  At any rate, what do we have? In order for a program like 
this to be implemented, as the Sandinists are proposing, first 
we need to get into the government. We need votes in order to 
get into the government. If those votes cannot be secured, we 
will be speaking in merely theoretical terms because there is 
not much that can be done from the opposition camp to change an 
economic program. In this case, the only thing left would be to 
support the just union demands that are determined to change the 
economic program. 
  [Reporter] What's your opinion on forming coalitions or 
alliances with other political parties for the 1996 elections? 
On several occasions, I have even heard Arnoldo Aleman mention 
that there could be a conservative alliance in order to face the 
FSLN. 
  [Ramirez] I believe that during the 1996 elections there 
will 
be different types of alliances on both sides. In no way am I 
going to rule out that the FSLN will or will not form an 
alliance for the elections. But before we can talk about 
alliances, we must first clearly define what is going to take 
place within the FSLN as a political entity, and if we can 
arrive at a satisfactory agreement that will fulfill the 
expectations of any other party that wants to associate with us. 
  This is why the results of this upcoming weekend congress 
are 
very important. Whatever comes out of this congress will 
determine our image before Nicaraguan society. Whatever takes 
place during the congress will once and for all determine the 
FSLN's position for the 1996 elections. Once the congress 
adopts a political position, this cannot be changed until some 
time before the elections, during another congress and where we 
adopt another position. But the assurances and confidence we 
project during this congress will be decisive in the 1996 
elections, with regard to potential allies as well as to 
society, which will have to choose between the FSLN and those 
political forces to select a government that will run Nicaragua 
as of 1996. 
  [Florentina Navarro, caller] Hello. Good morning. Is Dr. 
Sergio Ramirez speaking? 
  [Reporter] You are on the air. Come in, come in. 
  [Navarro] Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado? How are you? This is 
Florentina Navarro. I would like to ask you something. But 
first I wish to greet the congress and the lasting memory of our 
companeros Fabio Vega, German Pomares, Silvio Mayorga, Hernan 
Pomares, Silvio Buitrago, and all of the heros and martyrs, 
those who fell in Bocay and Pancasan, such as Faustino Ruiz and 
Zoilo Escobar. I hope their memory will last in unity in this 
congress, which is a congress of the people. 
  I want to ask Dr. Ramirez a question. In addition to the 
agenda, what other measures could be taken? As far as I 
remember, the first peace agreements were signed -- one of them 
was Esquipulas -- by the government, represented at the time by 
Commander Daniel, Dr. Sergio Ramirez, and other officials. They 
signed the agreements for peace we have been trying to attain. 
Other agreements and other documents were signed later. 
  Reading the Constitution, I find that the workers' only 
strategy of struggle is based on Article 103 of the 
Constitution, which recognizes the right to strike. This is a 
method for the workers' struggle, according to the Constitution. 
Other means of struggle, such as the right to create unions and 
respect for freedom of organization, are included in the 
Constitution. I think it is necessary to define in the Congress 
the nature of these legalized methods of struggle. We would 
also have to determine how true peace will be attained 
considering that there is no economic, social, or political 
stability. 
  One other thing, Dr. Ramirez. I have read nearly all of your 
writings and papers. I would like to know whether you have a 
socioeconomic plan for improving the country's situation. At a 
conference the other day, Dr. Francisco Solaina said that in 
Nicaragua there are no projects or economic policies that allow 
investments to crystallize in the country because of the absence 
of political or economic stability or security in society. It 
is necessary to devise a strategy to solve this situation [words 
indistinct] stability in the country. 
  My question deals with the economic situation in Nicaragua 
and whether what Dr. Lainez says is true, that in Nicaragua 
there is not even a set of projects or anything that could serve 
as the basis for an economic or social policy to solve the 
problems of unemployment and capital depletion. There has been 
much capital depletion for a long time. This is another factor, 
which not always is taken into consideration in opinion polls. 
At the congress, we have submitted a demand for an answer to 
the people's economic needs. It is necessary to change what 
some people describe as leadership and others describe in 
another way. What the people require are solutions to our 
problems, such as housing, education, health, and all of the 
services stipulated in the Constitution as the right of the 
Nicaraguan people. 
  [Ramirez] I appreciate Mrs. Navarro's call. Rather than a 
question, it has been a series of excellent remarks on the 
country's situation. The country requires an economic project 
like the one I have been trying to outline. It is necessary to 
think first of the large number of unemployed, those who must 
have the security afforded by land possession, who want to till 
the land. We must think of cooperative members, small- and 
medium-sized producers, small- and medium-sized industrialists 
and craftsmen, all of which comprise the majority of the 
population who want to participate in economic activities but 
are restricted by the crisis, who are not given bank loans, 
technical assistance, aid for production, new or repaired roads, 
etc. These needs would be met by a true socioeconomic plan for 
getting Nicaragua out of its economic crisis. National 
unemployment stands at 50 percent. 
  In addition, thousands of young people enter the labor 
market 
every year. These young people cannot find jobs [words 
indistinct]. Any economic project must first take into 
consideration these great dispossessed majorities of jobless and 
just walk the streets. 
  [Words indistinct] I also think that a socioeconomic plan 
which truly solves Nicaragua's social and economic problems 
cannot be sponsored by a single party. It is necessary to have 
a national agreement with the participation of unions and 
political parties. We must agree on medium- and long-term plans, 
which would change the course of the country development, ensure 
the country's economic stability while respecting other parties' 
ideas. If a government undoes what others did, if one 
privatizes while the other nationalizes, and then still others 
privatize again, we would go on and on trying unsuccessfully and 
the country would continue in crisis, chaos, and desperation. 
  [Reporter] Does that mean you agree with the Cosep [Higher 
Council of Private Enterprise] when it asked that a deal be 
struck so that those accords be kept in the years to come 
regardless of whichever government may be in office? 
  [Ramirez] I have been saying for a long time that we need a 
long-term accord that will take us beyond 2000 and give economic 
stability to the country, that we should all get in the same 
boat, and that regardless of the government that comes to power 
it should respect the guidelines or fundamental definitions 
contained in that plan. In that respect, (?Fidelina) is right 
in criticizing the lack of that economic program [words 
indistinct] that program must be the fruit of an accord among 
all the forces participating in the economy and in defining the 
country's political course. (?Fidelina) also asked about the 
methods of struggle, [words indistinct] are those allowed by the 
laws and the Constitution. The right to strike is a legitimate 
right. It is contained in the Constitution. Under the 
Constitution and the laws, workers have been guaranteed the use 
of their right to strike. 
  [Reporter] How about the method used? 
  [Ramirez] The method used is another matter. If a strike is 
implemented with armaments, rifles, and pistols, that does not 
fall within the parameters of the law. This is a topic of very 
intense discussion within the FSLN rank and file. Some say, if 
my house is being set on fire, why should I not defend myself? 
Why doesn't the judge see that? If the method used to evict 
someone from his house is to spill a gallon of gasoline in his 
home while his family is inside, that person, regardless of his 
political affiliation and regardless of who it is that is trying 
to evict him, whether thugs have been paid [word indistinct] 
violence to where he is resting at home with his children, the 
Criminal Code, the Constitution, recognizes the defense of 
legitimate self-defense. That is in the law. It is not illegal 
to defend oneself, if one watches others coming to disturb the 
peace of his house. 
  It is one thing to recognize what the laws state, and 
another 
thing to preach violence [words indistinct] this incites people, 
worsens [words indistinct], and will not bring peace, 
tranquility, stability to the country [words indistinct] 
violence, no matter where it comes from. Violence is not the 
domain of one side. Violence exists in different segments of 
society, and we must calm violence and abide by the laws and the 
Constitution, so we can create the necessary stability, we can 
have the investments that (?Fidelina) mentioned. So long as 
there is no peace and stability in the country, the economy will 
[words indistinct] there are no capital resources [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] On this matter, could we reach a defined position 
on methods of struggle in the debates? 
  [Ramirez] That is in the agenda of the FSLN congress, a 
definition of the methods of struggle. That is one of the most 
important points we are going to discuss in the congress. 
  [Reporter] We have a caller here. Hello? Go ahead, please. 
  [Unidentified caller] Dr. Ramirez, some say that [words 
indistinct] between Commander Daniel Ortega and Dr. Sergio 
Ramirez Mercado is for show, and deep down you are united. 
Also, Commander Ortega said that no Sandinist will be a 
candidate for president in 1996. They will support someone else 
who [words indistinct] the revolution. If you run for president, 
what will your platform be? Another question is: The charges 
against Managua Mayor Arnoldo Aleman were temporarily dropped. 
Will it remain that way [words indistinct] so he may not be 
eligible to run in 1996? 
  [Reporter] Dr. Ramirez will answer. 
  [Ramirez] I have already heard some say that the political 
debate within the FSLN is for show. Skeptics believe the 
political division is for show. I would like to tell the person 
who called, he did not give his full name, and I did not ask him 
to identify himself, that I am participating seriously in this 
debate. This does not mean [words indistinct] trying to 
preserve any kind of personal enmity. I do not believe personal 
enmities are the way to resolve a political debate. There is 
no reason why I should be an enemy of Commander Daniel Ortega. 
We worked together for many years [words indistinct] turn into 
his enemy because we are speaking a different political language 
and because our political stances are different. 
  I do not regard the political debate in terms of an enmity. 
If I am not antagonistic toward people who have no political or 
ideological identification.... 
  [Reporter interrupting] Even if they insult you? 
  [Ramirez] I have not been directly insulted. I must be 
honest in this respect. Even those who [words indistinct] I 
seek to convince them that if someone [words indistinct] and I 
have nothing to do with you, why should I participate in a 
political debate? I think that slurs disqualify the person who 
utters them, not the one who receives them. I think the 
Nicaraguan people and Nicaraguan society have enough political 
maturity to understand that slurs disqualify the persons who 
utter them. 
  If a convinced Sandinist, such as the woman who called me, 
expressed her thoughts, and accurately named all the heroes and 
martyrs -- I remember her with a great deal of admiration and 
affection -- if a woman like Mrs. Navarro who called earlier 
were to believe all those slurs against me, and all the insults 
and offenses uttered against me on the radio, which I repeat I 
[words indistinct], she would not be calling me here. She would 
not believe in me. 
  She gets into a dialogue with me and talks to me over the 
telephone because she respects me. For that reason, all those 
slurs have not made an impression on her heart, her mind, or her 
ears. That is why I am very pleased. I repeat, slurs 
disqualify those who utter them. 
  Now, I really do not agree with the view no Sandinist should 
begin to seek a presidential candidacy for the 1996 elections, 
and that we should seek a candidate outside the Sandinist ranks. 
  I believe that any party that says it does not have a 
suitable candidate to represent Nicaraguan society during a 
presidential election is a party that is defeated even before 
the election starts. If it says that it has to look for 
candidates outside [words indistinct] even Sandinists who are 
quite capable of participating in an election campaign and even 
winning. I am not going to [words indistinct], I have at least 
10 Sandinists in mind who have the prestige and sufficient 
backing to be presidential candidates. Now, if after 
scrutinizing the FSLN ranks we can ascertain that there is no 
suitable candidate, then we have no other choice but to look 
outside the party. However, a party cannot start looking for 
its candidate from outside its rank and file because it is 
disqualifying itself from the beginning. This does not imply 
that I am saying that Sergio Ramirez should be considered simply 
because he is a Sandinist. If necessary, I am quite willing to 
stand in line with any list of candidates. My sole objective in 
life is not to be a presidential candidate, just as my sole 
objective is not to accumulate great wealth and assets. I am 
not going to feel distressed or spiteful, nor will I abandon the 
FSLN or go to the dogs, or lock myself in a dark room and brood 
just because I was not selected presidential candidate. No sir, 
that is not my sole objective in life. My objective in life is 
to change this society, for it to become more equitable, for it 
to have a better social security, and for resources to be 
distributed more evenly. I intend to continue struggling for 
this. In concluding, the issue about Mayor Aleman is currently 
in the courts. So far an appeal has been filed with the Supreme 
Court of Justice on the sentence issued by the Managua Appeals 
Court. This has to be solved in accordance with court 
decisions. I insist that the state of law must be strengthened, 
and will be strengthened insofar as it is possible for us to 
acknowledge the weight of the court's decision. I don't know 
what is going to happen, if the appeal will be received, or what 
repercussions will result from the Supreme Court of Justice 
accepting the appeal. 
  [Reporter] Please allow me to insist again. I believe that 
we have covered many issues during these 90 minutes. In 
reference to the exclusion matter, you mentioned that it would 
not seem appropriate for a situation of exclusion to take place 
within the FSLN or during the congress. Yet, there is a 
situation of exclusion taking place at this time. You yourself 
mentioned the radio stations that do not allow you time to 
express the views of a segment that specifically has some clout 
and strength within the party. [Words indistinct] if this 
continues to take place. Will the issue of the radio stations 
owned by FSLN members be included in the Sandinist debates, or 
have you finally digested the fact that the radio stations are 
owned by private individuals? 
  [Ramirez] The problem is that I do believe that radio 
stations owned by the FSLN should allow equal time to those 
within the party who view things differently to express 
themselves. However, if someone tells me that a radio station 
such as Radio Ya, for example, is not [words indistinct] private 
property. In cases such as these, what can I do to get time on 
the radio if the owners are unwilling? Then, the only thing 
left for me to do is to approach the other stations that do 
allow me time. I believe that this is also part of the game of 
democracy. I am not going to file a lawsuit against a Radio Ya 
simply because they do not want to give me time. It's all a 
matter of taste, then.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] And also because the station is 
owned by private individuals. 
  [Ramirez] I would like a debate to take place in order to 
really determine how is it that these stations are owned by 
private individuals. I believe that is something that concerns 
mechanisms within the party itself which we must clarify as 
thoroughly and openly as possible. 
  [Reporter] I would like to [word indistinct] Henry Ruiz, 
who is running for the position of FSLN secretary general, and 
as a person who as treasurer has handled issues related to 
assets owned by the Sandinist Party. As such he is aware of 
what assets the FSLN has and what it does not. Then we now have 
Henry Ruiz as candidate and the other side says that he is the 
candidate of division. 
  [Ramirez] Henry Ruiz is FSLN treasurer. I have been present 
when he has delivered his financial reports and [words 
indistinct]. Radio Ya is not registered as one of the party's 
assets. BARRICADA and Radio Sandino are registered, but not 
this radio station. I believe that it is the party treasurer's 
responsibility if the party's list of assets suddenly does not 
appear. I want to be perfectly clear in that I am not going to 
make a big fuss simply because I am not allowed media time. Nor 
am I going to resign the party because I am not given sufficient 
media time. I intend to continue to struggle so that genuine 
democracy exists within the party. 
  [Reporter] We have now reached the end of this program and 
want to thank Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado for appearing on our 
"Impact 620" program. What is your message to FSLN followers 
and members and the Nicaraguan people about this congress? 
  [Ramirez] My message is to the congressmen. There are 500 
congressmen from all over the country and the congress begins on 
Friday and ends on Sunday. I want to tell them that the FSLN's 
future is in their hands. They need to be aware that they will 
be responsible for deciding the FSLN's course. They are elected 
by the rank and file and their will should not be affected by 
any possible meddling. There is no party organization at the 
departmental or municipal level, no type of assembly, no small 
or large congress that can hold to ransom the will of the 
national congressmen. Their will is sovereign. They are not 
obligated to any sort of decision or previously agreed 
resolution by the party to vote a certain way for or against a 
certain resolution. Their wills, sovereignly expressed in 
Congress by raising their hand or by secret vote, is what will 
determine the fundamental decision that will guide the party 
over the next few years. This is why the conscience and vote of 
these congressmen is fundamental to defining the course the 
party will take. These congressmen must responsibly remember 
and keep fresh in their minds that they are the people who truly 
represent the FSLN's true will. 
  [Reporter] We want to thank Dr. Sergio Ramirez. We have 
requested TELCOR [Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal 
Services Institute] to improve some of our telephone lines 
because some are noisy and it is difficult to put the calls on 
the air. We hope that this is not the only time we have you 
here on this program. We are at your service with this station 
that has great coverage. With the massive participation of the 
people both Sandinists and non-Sandinists can express their 
views here.

  [Text] (NA-DYN) -- President Carlos Menem signed a decree 
extending federal control of the province of Santiago del Estero 
until 10 days after next year's general election, local news 
agencies announced last night. Menem signed the executive order 
early this morning at Jorge Newbery Metropolitan airport before 
departing for the fourth Ibero-American Information Science and 
Law Congress in San Carlos de Bariloche. 
  Federal trustee Juan Schiaretti's tenure in Santiago del 
Estero was due to end yesterday under the original measure 
approved by Congress last December following several days of 
violent protest in the provincial capital. The President sent a 
bill to Congress last week but the body was unable to make 
quorum and thus Menem decided to resort to a decree. 
  Earlier yesterday, Santiago del Estero National Deputy Jose 
Luis Zavalia warned that the use of a decree could endanger the 
Radical-Justicialist Olivos Pact on constitutional reform 
because "federal takeovers must be ordered exclusively by 
Congress." The deputy accused Menem of extending federal 
control in order to take over the province's social security 
system and privatize public agencies "without adequate 
legislative control."

  [Text] San Carlos de Bariloche, 16 May (NA) -- Tonight, 
President Carlos Menem inaugurated here the Fourth 
Ibero-American Information Science and Law Congress, whose 
sessions will be held under the slogan "Quest for Integration." 
  The congress, sponsored by the Argentine Justice Ministry, 
has been described as being of national interest, and has 
gathered experts from America, Spain, Italy, and Belgium, among 
other countries. 
  This congress, which will hold sessions until 20 May, has 
been inspired by the issue of "the integration of 
Ibero-America." The four key issues of this congress are state 
reform, community law, the rights and liberties of individuals, 
and technological compatibility. 
  Upon inaugurating the sessions, Menem said: "It is essential 
to keep abreast through growth because it is not possible to 
grow and advance unless we prepare our communities." Menem 
emphasized: "Information is important, but communication is more 
important still. We cannot be free unless we abide by the laws, 
but wise laws." 
  For his part, Justice Minister Jorge Maiorano said at noon 
today: "If we assume that it is true that information science is 
linked to power, then we are astonished by the rapid changes." 
Maiorano also stressed: "Technological progress must serve 
human beings." He emphasized that "the use of information 
science for the benefit of humanity" is in the hands of the 
participants of this congress. 
  In addition to Menem and Maiorano, Rio Negro Vice Governor 
Edgardo Gagliardi and Bariloche Mayor Maria Severino de Costa, 
among other authorities, were present at the inauguration 
ceremony.

  [Text] The Economy Ministry estimates that in the period 
1994-96, government spending will rise from $61 billion to $88 
billion, and that a strong negative trade balance deficit will 
continue. It does, however, forecast that some 250,000 jobs will 
be created. 
  All these details are included in the estimates drafted by 
the Economy Ministry for the "A Growing Argentina 1994-96" plan, 
which was put together by the Economic Planning Secretariat. The 
principal points of this plan were partially disclosed by 
President Carlos Menem in his 1 May address to open the new 
session of Congress. 
  The plan envisages the objectives for the two-year period 
1994-96. These are: to consolidate the achieved stability; to 
strengthen economic growth through an increase in investments, 
savings, and exports; and to promote higher levels of employment 
and a more equitable distribution of income at personal and 
regional levels. 
  Within the macroeconomic framework, the Economy Ministry 
forecasts that the Argentine economy will continue to grow in 
1994, recording high levels of investment and an increase in 
exports. 
  In this regard, the plan estimates that with the 
considerable 
decline in relative prices, the renewal of a significant amount 
of reproducible capital, the incorporation of technology, and 
the completion of major energy projects, the investment-output 
ratio will be enough to sustain high growth rates. 
  Later in the document, the economic team extrapolates that 
government expenditure will edge up 44 percent, especially in 
general administration and in the defense and justice portfolios. 
  Social government expenditure, which will total $51.014 
billion this year, will rise to $57.375 billion in 1995 and to 
$63.417 billion in 1996. This will represent an increase from 18 
to 18.8 percent of the GDP. 
  With regard to the consolidated government spending, 
however, 
the plan estimates that the new scheme for allocating resources 
will be enhanced in this period, thus resulting in an increase 
in government spending to meet constitutional requirements and 
social programs of approximately 4.8 and 11.5 percent 
respectively. 
  The plan, drawn up by the Economy Ministry, bases its 
predictions on the assumption that a fiscal balance and the 
soundness of public finances will be maintained; tax revenues 
will increase at an annual rate of approximately 17 percent; the 
privatization process will be concluded; the appropriation of 
financial resources for social programs will be given top 
priority; expenditures will be more equitably distributed; and 
investments will increase. 
  With regard to foreign trade, the report states that the 
trade balance will continue to show a deficit. It is estimated 
that the trade deficit will add up to $4.351 billion this year, 
$4.365 billion in 1995, and $3.604 billion in 1996. 
  It is thus estimated that exports will climb from $16.116 
billion to $24.763 billion, while imports will rise from $23.888 
billion to $29.968 billion. 
  The Economy Ministry considers that a recovery in trade 
began 
to be seen in 1993, and it extrapolates that by the year 2000 it 
will have expanded by 11 percent as compared with last year's 
figures. 
  The plan says that "it is only natural that imports should 
grow at a faster pace than exports in a country that has 
undergone so many changes." It speculates that the increase in 
international interest rates will lead to a decline in imports 
due to a shrinkage in available foreign savings. 
  Concerning employment, the economic team believes that the 
incorporation of capital goods into companies, labor 
flexibility, the reduction of the tax burden, the foreseen 
deregulation in the construction industry, and the enforcement 
of the Fiscal Pact will foster the creation of more jobs. 
  They estimate that 700,000 new jobs will be created between 
1993 and 1996 in urban areas. In other words, the government's 
estimate is based on the premise that some 250,000 new jobs will 
be created every year during that period. 
  As for financial considerations, the plan underlines that 
the 
capital account of the balance of payments will attract $31 
billion in the period 1994-96. It nonetheless foresees that 
there will be greater uncertainty in international markets and a 
decline in the inflow of foreign capital. 
  In conclusion, an increase in public investment in different 
areas is foreshadowed in the "A Growing Argentina 1994-96" plan. 
It also establishes a system of priorities: to promote projects 
aimed at the training of human resources from the low-income 
bracket; to develop programs and projects that contribute to 
enhancing the qualified labor force; and to channel investments 
into plans that envisage reducing regional imbalances. 
  The plan thus underlines that public investments at 
national, 
provincial, and municipal levels will total $6.7773 billion in 
1994, representing 2.4 percent of GDP. This amount is to be 
supplemented with $3.086 billion to be invested by private 
companies in charge of public utilities.

  [Text] (DYN) -- A British company -- under the guise of 
carrying out important ecological work -- is planning to plunder 
some 50,000 hectares of quebracho woods in the province of 
Santiago del Estero without the permission of the Argentine 
state, according to a report from a local environmental group. 
  A complaint was lodged yesterday by the Cordoba FUNAM 
(Foundation for the Protection of the Environment) ecological 
group in conjunction with a fellow British group which said the 
woods, in the region of Moreno in the northeast of Santiago del 
Estero, would be in grave danger if no action was taken by the 
government to shelve the plans. 
  The British company, currently assessing the cost of the 
project, hopes to market the quebracho with the brandname "AAA 
Hardwood." The work would be carried out in conjunction with the 
local Australian Argentine Agricultural (AAA) group. 
  "The project will be promoted by an ecological lobby as if 
it 
had come from a forest which had been exploited rationally," 
FUNAM President Raul Montenegro said. "In other words they will 
try to fabricate a green image." 
  The British company's plans, leaked to FUNAM last month, 
estimate that once work gets under way in Santiago del Estero, 
the company will be in a position to produce some 3.6 million 
metres of parquet, 13,901 tons of charcoal, and 30,000 tons of 
other fuel. 
  A probe into the affair has also discovered that a leading 
bank in the Federal Capital has offered to put up capital in 
order to fund the project. 
  Santiago del Estero forestry commission representatives have 
said they will fight the plans although they have not yet 
received precise details of the British company's intentions. 
Meanwhile the national government has made no comments on the 
case. The forests under threat are considered the most important 
of their type in Argentina.

  [Text] Santiago, 17 May (EFE)--Chilean officials reported 
today that the Llaima volcano in the Andes mountain range in the 
Chilean region of Araucania has erupted with great intensity; 
therefore, a state of emergency has been declared in that region. 
  The volcano, which is located 700 km south of Santiago at an 
altitude of 3,125 meters, is making underground noise, its smoke 
is reaching a height of 8,000 meters, and lava can be seen in 
its cone. 
  This information was confirmed by Ninth Region Intendant 
Oscar Eltit, who said a state of emergency has been declared in 
the area around the volcano, especially in Vilcun, San Patricio, 
Cherquenco, Melipeuco, and Caracautin in the direction of Temuco. 
  It also has been reported that Carabineros and the Air Force 
sent helicopters to overfly the area. 
  A team made up of geologists and emergency office personnel 
also have left for an on-site evaluation of nearby settlements, 
although no decision has been made yet on an evacuation. 
  According to information from the area, the smoke reaching 
8,000 meters is moving east toward Argentina. 
  Chile, which is located in the so-called Pacific fire belt, 
has 2,085 volcanoes, of which 55 are active, and has an average 
of one eruption every eight months. 
  The most recent eruptions include the Hudson and Lascar 
volcanoes, which affected settlements in southern and northern 
Chile, respectively. In the case of the Lascar volcano, its 
ashes and smoke reached several countries, especially Argentina.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mate Granic, "Croatian foreign minister and </F>
vice president," by Maria Isabel Seguel; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Seguel] What is a foreign minister of a nation at 
war doing visiting a small country the other side of the world? 
  [Granic] Croatia is no longer just a country at war. Only 25 
percent of our territory is still occupied, to be more precise 
under the control of the United Nations. We signed cease-fire 
agreements with the local Serb authorities and we expect to hold 
the second round of negotiations regarding economic issues and 
the return of refugees, and then begin political negotiations. 
  Croatia is a very stable and democratic country. It has the 
most stable economy in the entire region. Our inflation will not 
go over 12 percent. Croatia expects a reasonably good tourist 
season. We are also in a full process of privatization. 
  [Seguel] I am even more confused over why you are in Chile. 
  [Granic] Because Chile was one of the first countries to 
recognize Croatia. Also because our economic relations are very 
good. The most important reason is to explain the current 
situation of my country which could be and wants to be the door 
to Eastern Europe and an opportunity for investments. Some 
Chilean-Croats have already bought companies in Croatia, like 
Mr. Luksic who bought the second largest brewery in our country. 
  [Seguel] While there is a conflict, it is cheap to buy. Are 
you saying the war will end soon? 
  [Granic] That is not easy to say. The most important thing 
will be future negotiations regarding a final agreement, and all 
the economic issues that will certainly be discussed with the 
local Serb authorities. 
  [Seguel] How difficult was it for you to negotiate with the 
Serbs taking into account their terrible image as aggressors, 
according to the international media? 
  [Granic] It has been very difficult right from the start but 
still the negotiation continues to be the cheapest way for the 
peaceful reintegration of the zones under UN control in 
Croatia's legal system. 
  [Seguel] What was your most difficult moment during the 
negotiations? 
  [Granic] There were two difficult moments. The negotiations 
with the local Serb authorities and the negotiations with the 
Armed Forces of the former Yugoslavia for exchanging prisoners. 
  [Seguel] Why do you believe the Serbs continue the policy of 
occupying the territory? Will it be costly to them in terms of 
image in the future? 
  [Granic] It is an unreasonable policy in the long-term and 
in 
the short-term it is also costly because its economy is in 
ruins. Serbia is absolutely isolated and it believes the more 
territory it has at the time of the negotiations the stronger 
its position will be. 
  [Seguel] What is your basic rule for negotiations? 
  [Granic] The main thing is that the zones under UN control 
return to Croatia. We are ready to discuss the rights of the 
minorities, the ethnic communities, and local autonomy. We are 
willing to accept international supervision. Croatia will accept 
negotiations with Serb-Croatian authorities regarding future 
local autonomy as well as guarantees for minorities, but we are 
not willing to negotiate our borders. 
  [Seguel] There seems to be more people who want the war to 
continue than those who advocate peace. 
  [Granic] The future negotiations will include talks on the 
demarcation between the Bosnian Federation (Muslims and Croats 
together) and the Serbs, and the type of association between the 
Serbs and the federation because we will ask the Serbs to join 
the federation. I believe the Serbs will refuse. I believe the 
problem of demarcation relates to the percentage of the 
territory we talked about. The Serbs now have control over 70 
percent of it and we have proposed 51 percent for the federation 
and 49 percent for the Serbs. 
  [Seguel] And what did they answer? 
  [Granic] They proposed no more than 47 percent for the 
federation and the Muslims proposed 60 percent. Another 
important problem here will be the corridor the Serbs will 
probably attack soon. It is also very important to prevent that 
Serbian offensive. 
  [Seguel] So you already know how the war will continue.... 
  [Granic] It is simple. But let us go on, the Serbs have 
placed some conditions on signing a total cease fire and the 
start of negotiations, such as lifting economic sanctions. This 
is why it is necessary more than ever to keep the pressure on 
the Serbs very firm. 
  [Seguel] Why does it seem that when the aggressor is so 
clearly identified, the international community cannot act or 
does not want to act with more force? 
  [Granic] This is the question the people on the streets in 
Croatia ask. There are two basic reasons. On one side there were 
the different interests of the great powers and on the other 
side there is the brutal Serbian aggressiveness. Probably, there 
has never been anything similar in the history of Europe. The 
decisions by both the European and international community came 
late and they did not serve or they were not implemented with 
enough decision. The Serbian aggression should have been stopped 
and prevented in Vukovar, when a Croatian city that was under 
siege for two full months was continuously bombed. At that time, 
2,000 people were killed. And in the harshest 72 hours, 2,500 
people were killed. Had the international community acted then, 
it is possible that the conflict would have developed in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Seguel] Did you expect or were you surprised by the attack 
on Gorazde? 
  [Granic] I was only surprised at its brutality. This was 
unreasonable for the Serbs to do because, looking at it from a 
reasonable manner, the only path the Serbs have ahead is the 
path of negotiations and to seek a peaceful end to the war in 
Bosnia. 
  [Seguel] If you were not surprised by the attack on Gorazde 
and if you could predict what the Serbs will do, what other 
surprises can the international community expect? 
  [Granic] The plans of the Serbs are quite clear. Their 
strategic interests are, first, to widen the corridor in the 
Brcko zone. Other interests include the Muslim settlements in 
the eastern part of Bosnia and in Bihac. All this depends 
exclusively on the international community. In other words, if 
the international community shows enough firmness in its 
decision to get the Serbs to negotiate and also to get the 
Muslims, who are the most threatened, to join in. Regarding the 
Republic of Croatia, we will support the agreements signed in 
Washington and this means the installation of the Federation of 
Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We will support 
solutions leading to cease-fire in the region. We will support 
the pressures exerted on the Serbs to make them join the 
negotiations. 
  [Seguel] Do you like to negotiate, or are you tired of it? 
  [Granic] Yes, I like it. In addition to the negotiations 
that 
I have already mentioned, in which I was the chief Croatian 
negotiator, I also headed the group that negotiated with the 
Muslims. The are still plenty of negotiations to carry out and 
it is tiring work. I believe the Washington agreements were the 
best success so far. I would be the happiest person in the world 
if I could finish everything this year because I would prevent a 
lot of human suffering. So many atrocities have been committed 
and there have been so many victims that I believe we should all 
do everything possible to end it. 
  [Seguel] Has this war helped you to understand matters that 
made no sense during Tito's Yugoslavia? 
  [Granic] During the Tito years, especially in 1974 when the 
current Constitution was proclaimed, he was strongly sensitive 
to the topic of nationalism in Yugoslavia. He kept Serb 
nationalism under control, and he also controlled the economy. 
All types of contradictions emerged after Tito, like the 
aggressive Serb nationalism that sought a great Serbia, and of 
course the resistance of the others. 
  The presidents of Slovenia and Croatia proposed a 
confederation before the war. This was rejected by the Serbs. 
Now there is absolutely no chance of any type of union between 
the Serbs and Croats. We can only be neighbors. 
  [Seguel] What will you do after the war? Will you return to 
being a doctor or continue as a negotiator? 
  [Granic] I have become so deeply enmeshed in political life 
that it will be very difficult for me to return to the medical 
profession. The end of the war is currently my motivation, as 
are the development of democratic institutions, European 
relations and integration, and participation in the creation of 
a modern democratic state. 
  [Seguel] Are all parties in Croatia in agreement regarding 
the progress of negotiations? 
  [Granic] All parties agree regarding the negotiations with 
the Muslims. As for the Serbs, the opposition parties do not 
agree because they are against any type of negotiation unless 
Serbia publicly recognizes the Republic of Croatia. We also want 
Serbia to do this, but it is our belief that it must be a mutual 
recognition, and this can be achieved step by step. There is 
also the matter of economic cooperation, but for this to occur 
there must be a restoration of communications by road, rail, and 
the restoration of the oil pipeline system. The return of 
refugees, or displaced persons, and that of "the external 
states" are also important. 
  Talking about the opposition, they are convinced that they 
could carry out privatizations much better than the party that 
is in power. But this is a part of democracy, and we are aware 
of some errors we have made, but we believe Croatia is a stable 
country. 
  [Seguel] Could you put on a doctor's smock and diagnose the 
sick patient in front of you (Yugoslavia)? 
  [Granic] Without resolving the complex situation in which 
Yugoslavia finds itself there can be no peace solution for 
Croatia. A peaceful solution cannot be achieved without strong 
and firm assistance from the international community. Then there 
is the question of how, at the same time, to resolve the problem 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the zones in Croatia that are 
protected by the United Nations. These are two fundamental 
problems. Of course, the international community still has the 
problem of resolving stability in Macedonia, it still has to 
ensure the autonomy of Kosovo, human rights problems, ethnic 
problems, and the rights of the national minorities that live in 
Serbia, especially those of the Croats. It must also solve the 
question of the system of regional security. 
  In sum, a sick patient that needs a multipurpose team to 
help 
it recover, including a long convalescence.

  [Text] Santiago, 17 May (EFE) -- The Chilean Government is 
making all kinds of legal efforts to reverse a ruling of 
"treason to the fatherland" that a Peruvian military court 
handed down against three Chilean citizens, who were sentenced 
to life imprisonment for being involved in terrorist activities. 
  Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa reported today that the 
Chilean Government has asked the attorneys defending the three 
Chileans in Peru to file an appeal for annulment of the case, 
and transfer it to civil courts. 
  The Chilean Government is making efforts to have the 
Chileans 
tried for terrorist crimes and not for the crime of "treason to 
the fatherland," as determined by a Peruvian military court, a 
crime that involves life imprisonment sentences. 
  The Chilean Foreign Ministry has repeatedly expressed that 
it 
is not appropriate to apply to foreign citizens the crime of 
"treason to the fatherland," a legal classification that the 
Peruvian law includes to punish terrorism crimes. 
  Chileans Jaime Castillo Petruzzi, Maria Concepcion 
Pincheira, 
Lautaro Mellado, and Alejandro Astorga 10 days ago received 
final confirmation of their sentences to life imprisonment, with 
one year of incommunicado status. 
  Explaining the Chilean stance on this issue a few days ago, 
the foreign minister noted that the claim filed with the 
Peruvian authorities does not in any way represent a weakness 
toward terrorism.

  [Text] Santiago, 17 May (EFE) -- Chilean Foreign Minister 
Carlos Figueroa noted today that Chile agrees with the 
establishment of a sanctuary for the protection of whales in the 
southern hemisphere, but located south of latitude 60 degrees, 
at the so-called Antarctic convergence. 
  Minister Figueroa explained that the Chilean stance is 
slightly different from the French position, which establishes a 
whale sanctuary from 40 degrees latitude south to Antarctica, 
including Chilean waters from the city of Valdivia, 835 km south 
of Santiago, to Cape Horn, at 56 degrees latitude south. 
  The foreign minister emphasized that Chile wants to explain 
at the next International Whale Commission (IWC) meeting, 
scheduled in Puerto Vallarta (Mexico) from 23 to 27 May, a 
"consistent" position with respect to the four sea treaties or 
conventions that it has signed. 
  Chile has signed conventions on the sea, on the sea bed, and 
on high seas fishing, as well as a treaty on territorial seas. 
  The foreign minister noted that Chile has banned whale 
hunting within its 200-mile territorial waters. He therefore 
indicated that our country "has already initiated unilateral 
protection of this resource." 
  The foreign minister confirmed that Chile is willing to sign 
a broad multilateral agreement to protect whale species. He 
noted that there are fairly advanced studies on the situation of 
the ecosystem at the abovementioned Antarctic convergence. 
  Representatives of the "Greenpeace" ecological organization 
in Chile delivered on 11 May to the president of the Republic, 
Eduardo Frei, a petition with more than 300,000 signatures 
supporting the establishment of a sanctuary for the last whale 
populations in the South Pacific. 
  According to data supplied by this ecological organization, 
more than 1 million whales have been hunted down over the past 
80 years, and the "blue whale," the largest whale species on our 
planet at 32 meters long and 100 metric tons in weight, has been 
particularly affected.

  [Text] Here are the results of the latest poll by the 
National Consulting Center, CNC, conducted at the request of the 
Bavaria company. The poll was conducted between 10 and 12 May 
among people over 18 living in the country's urban areas. The 
polling firm visited 25 municipalities. Methodology of the 
sample: random, stratified, and [word indistinct] in homes. The 
interview was conducted in person with sample ballots. Number 
interviewed: 2,290. Margin of error: 2.7 percent. 
  The CNC conducted 1,050 interviews in big cities, 640 in 
medium-sized cities, and 600 in small cities. Let us see in 
what big cities it conducted the interviews: 400 in Santa Fe de 
Bogota; 200 in Medellin; 150 in Barranquilla; 100 in 
Bucaramanga. As for medium-sized cities: 80 in each of the 
following cities: Tunja, Monteria, Girardot, Neiva, Santa Marta, 
Pasto, Pereira, and Cartago. As for small cities: 50 in each of 
the following: La Ceja, Galapa, Carmen de Bolivar, Chiquinquira, 
[words indistinct], Santander de Quilichao, Chia, Macao, 
Pamplona, Espinal, and Buga. 
  In the poll, which was contracted by Bavaria and which 
Caracol learned about last night, CNC asked the 2,290 people 
surveyed in 25 municipalities whether they plan to vote in the 
May presidential elections. Fifty-eight percent replied 
definitely yes, 17 percent replied probably yes, 7 percent 
probably not, 18 percent definitely no. No one refrained from 
replying. 
  CNC asked: Which candidate on the ballot will you vote for 
in 
the presidential election? Forty-seven percent for Ernesto 
Samper Pizano, 40 percent for Andres Pastrana Arango, 4 percent 
for Antonio Navarro Wolff, 2 percent for Miguel Alfredo Maza 
Marquez, 2 percent for Enrique Parejo Gonzalez, 1 percent for 
Regina Betancur, and 1 percent for Miguel Antonio Zamora Avila. 
The rest of the 18 candidates did not get even 1 percent. Three 
percent of those polled did not indicate their choice. 
  Let us look at the previous CNC poll. It was conducted 
between 29 April and 3 May in 59 municipalities, with a 1.7 
percent margin of error. Forty-seven percent said they would 
vote for Samper. In the current poll, 47 percent said they 
would vote for Samper. There is no change. 
  In the previous poll, 44 percent said they would vote for 
Pastrana. On this occasion, only 40 percent said they would 
vote for Pastrana. According to the CNC poll, Pastrana has lost 
4 percentage points in the last 10 days. In the previous poll, 
3 percent said they would vote for Navarro Wolff. In the 
current poll, 4 percent said they would for Navarro Wolff. 
  In the last poll, 1 percent would vote for Maza Marquez 
while 
in the current one, 2 percent said they would vote for him. In 
the past poll, Parejo Gonzalez received 1 percent of the support 
while in the current poll, 2 percent. In the previous poll, 
Regina Betancur received 1 percent, and in the current one she 
also received 1 percent. No other candidate received at least 1 
percent in the previous poll. In this poll, Zamora Avila 
received 1 percent.

  [Text] In contrast to Thursday's [12 May] debate, which was 
reportedly disorganized, the presidential candidates' debate, 
according to today's edition of EL TIEMPO, was restrained and 
boring -- it was really no debate. Perhaps the biggest mistake 
was having two candidates who want to run the country speaking 
for 90 minutes on how to manage Bogota. 
  The debate began with a warning by the host. 
  [Unidentified speaker] "We continue to be Liberals, will be 
Liberals, and will vote Liberal." 
  More than a debate, it was an exposition of ideas. 
Controversy was nonexistent. The candidates' proposals, even 
though they were not the same, were so similar that the only way 
to tell them apart was their suits. 
  [Samper] "I pledge to double the number of policemen in 
Bogota." 
  [Pastrana] "Finally, to increase the number of policemen. 
From now until the end of the century we must create 300,000 
new jobs for policemen." 
  Commenting on the mayor of Bogota, they both commented on 
how 
he should be above party interests. Both committed themselves 
to expanding Bogota's highway program. They seemed divided on 
the issue of financing the subway, but Pastrana admitted that 
the nation must contribute to this. They were so alike that 
they both had the same answer when asked how they were different. 
  [Samper] "I think I have much more specific proposals on 
city 
and public security issues." 
  [Pastrana] "I think I was more specific on the topic of 
security." 
  The newsmen explained why there was no real debate. 
  [First unidentified reporter] "It was a presentation of 
ideas, rather than a debate. There was no controversy." 
  [Second unidentified reporter] "Yes, it appeared to be an 
exposition of ideas. They appear to be speaking the same 
language and have absolutely minimal differences." 
  [Third unidentified reporter] "Yes, they really did not 
define their differences." 
  Some people said the debate was so cold that it made them 
sleepy.

  [Text] Manizales -- The National Coffee Growers Association 
received with satisfaction and moderate optimism the report that 
coffee prices had closed at $1.45 a pound on international 
coffee markets. 
  The Association believes the government should take 
advantage 
of those circumstance to adjust coffee prices to a point more 
equitable than that existing when the world quota agreement was 
interrupted. 
  Association sources reported Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes 
as saying that if this price holds for at least 30 days, the 
government would consider a new adjustment. 
  In addition, the Cooperative of Caldas Coffee Growers has 
reported a drop in local reserves and that the marketing of the 
mid-season crop has been reduced by 500,000 arrobas compared to 
the same period last year.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 17 May. 
  Colombian sugar exports increased 27.7 percent in 1993 while 
sugar production fell 0.33 percent. This drop meant that 1.833 
million tons of sugar were produced in 1993 compared to 1.839 
tons in 1992. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 7 May 94 
p 3B) 
  As of 12 May, 125 kg of coffee will be sold at a price of 
132,000 pesos, which constitutes a 10-percent increase over the 
former price. The National Committee of Coffee-Growers agreed 
on this price readjustment on 11 May. The increase obtained 
will give the National Coffee Fund additional revenues of 70 
billion pesos. (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in 
Spanish 1200 GMT 12 May 94) 
  The financial system continues to have liquidity problems. 
The interbanking rate dropped to 35-percent annually. Savings 
accounts are growing at an average rate of 44-percent. An 
increase in imports has helped increase the current dollar 
exchange price to 841 pesos. Interest rates are stable. The 
inflation rate for the first trimester of 1994 has been around 
12 percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 15 May 94 p 
2B)

<F P=106> [Interview with Jaime Yoshiyama, president of the Democratic </F>
Constituent Congress, CCD, by Juan Carlos Tafur; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Tafur] In the last few days, several legislators 
have raised the question of whether they are eligible for 
reelection in the next legislative term. Some time ago, you 
said this is more a moral issue than a legal one. In 
conclusion, how does the situation stand? Do you believe the 
national situation can tolerate these petty discussions? 
  [Yoshiyama] Let me explain exactly what happened. First, 
there was great confusion about the electoral system. We wanted 
to implement the Constitution based on the three organizations 
[National Election Board, National Office of Election 
Procedures, and National Civil Registry] because this is the 
modern thing to do. This is not something we invented because 
this system is working in other countries. We believe an 
electoral system based on three organizations is perfect. When 
we started analyzing it, however, we realized that we might have 
some difficulties implementing it. For example, we had no 
control over how long it would take the professional boards to 
choose their representatives to elect the National Council of 
Magistrates members. 
  [Tafur] No one realized this when you were drafting the 
Constitution? 
  [Yoshiyama] Yes we did, but we thought the Constitution's 
drafting was not going to take that long. We drafted those 
chapters back in August-September 1993 and believed that if the 
Constitution was approved after the referendum, we would 
immediately start to work on all this. Aside from all this, we 
thought we would first implement the system. Only later did we 
realize that despite being the modern thing to do, we were 
taking risks and that perhaps we might be unable to implement it 
by election time. Not at our end, but because we depended on 
others and political problems always come up. Secondly, our 
main objective was to achieve an image of complete openness, of 
security and cleanliness. We sought to achieve a completely 
clean electoral system. After making a cost-profit analysis 
like economists do, we have no qualms in accepting what the 
opposition is upholding. We took the Bar Association draft, 
which in its sixth article clearly states: "You cannot seek 
reelection." That is what it states. We discussed it among 
ourselves and all of us decided "we are willing" to accept it. 
  [Tafur] Whom are you referring to when you say all of us? 
  [Yoshiyama] The people who helped the New Majority-Change 90 
[NM-C90] internal group. Clearly aware that this article 
specifies that we cannot seek reelection, I asked: "Are we 
aware of this? Are we aware that this means we cannot seek 
reelection, that we are sacrificing our personal interests for 
superior interests so that the country gets a clear message 
about the electoral system?" 
  [Tafur] All of them agreed? 
  [Yoshiyama] Well, not everyone was present, only some... 
  [Tafur] ... Who were the ones who attended the meeting? 
  [Yoshiyama] I do not remember...I believe CCD members Robles 
and Sandoval were there, but... 
  [Tafur] ... Was CCD and NM member Luz Salgado there? 
  [Yoshiyama] Yes, I believe Luz Salgado was there...I cannot 
say because I do not remember but we made decisions of this 
sort. There were 30 of us. Not all of them are in Lima all the 
time. CCD member Martha Chavez was certainly not there because 
she was involved in all the dealings... 
  [Tafur] ... Perhaps she refused to attend the meeting? 
  [Yoshiyama] No, but perhaps she just did not know about it. 
We hold regular meetings but sometimes we do not know which 
issues are going to be discussed on the agenda because we 
discuss correlated issues. We are a very flexible group in this 
sense. We do not have a fixed agenda, taking of minutes, 
reading of minutes. A person stands up and starts speaking; 
that is all. 
  [Tafur] In short, we can assert that the group accepted the 
proposal? 
  [Yoshiyama] Yes, the group accepted it although perhaps some 
did not understand the issue. I am speaking on a personal 
basis. In that meeting, Yoshiyama understood that the group 
decided not to seek reelection. 
  [Tafur] Beyond the constitutional provision, would you say 
there is a moral obligation to do this? 
  [Yoshiyama] I believe there is a commitment I will assume 
when I vote on the issue. To my surprise, when we held the 
plenum session the friends in the minority, who have much more 
legal experience, were in favor. At the time, I was very 
pleased and of course I thought they also agreed not to seek 
reelection. This is why I say that I believe we assumed 
commitment when we approved the Bar Association draft bill. How 
can we speak of reelection? Personally, I will never propose it. 
I feel morally unable to propose an amendment to this clause 
because I voted in favor of it despite the fact that, as you 
know, the plenum president does not vote. 
  [Tafur] Many people say you are not really making a 
sacrifice because you will run for vice president. 
  [Yoshiyama] No, absolutely, no, no. That is what people say. 
They have even told me: "Obviously chap, you are already on the 
ticket, so why should you care." No, I emphatically declare, 
first, that I have no political ambition whatsoever and that I 
am not making electoral calculations. All the people who know me 
are aware that things are not like this. I have always thought 
that we are here to make a constitution and a series of laws, 
without thinking of personal objectives or reelection. I fully 
disapprove of lawmakers turning this into a profession. 
  [Tafur] Do you think there should be professional 
politicians? 
  [Yoshiyama] I do not think so. 
  [Tafur] Do you think they should be amateurs? 
  [Yoshiyama] I would not go as far as that, but at least they 
should not take this as a profession. The point is that there 
are extraordinary lawmakers, but a few of them are using their 
position for personal advantage. 
  [Tafur] OIGA magazine claims that this Congress is too 
professional. In other words, that its salary level surpasses 
even that of the previous Congress. 
  [Yoshiyama] No. Look, I have some information here. I 
emphatically maintain that this Congress is much more efficient 
than the previous ones. I will prove it by mentioning three 
figures. First, the previous Congress had 4,000 people. Today, 
we are 700 and the trend is to reduce this number. Each person 
now corresponds to six in the previous Congress. Don't you think 
this is highly efficient? Not only because of the lower number 
of people, but because fewer people means smaller facilities, 
lower transportation expenses, lower electric power consumption, 
and many other reduced items. Second, our annual savings amount 
to $70 million. This amount is enough for building 280 schools, 
of the type of beautiful schools President Fujimori is 
dedicating everyday. They are 280 schools; $70 million is a lot 
of money. Third, our average legislative production has been 
three times as much as that of the previous Congress and the 
Constituent Assembly. 
  [Tafur] Are high salaries justified then? 
  [Yoshiyama] No, wait a minute. Why did we reach this 
production level? Because in the past, all bills were studied at 
plenary sessions of Congress and committees worked very little. 
There was the impression that people worked harder, but debates 
were highly unproductive. Today committees are at work and only 
the bills that have been properly screened reach the plenary 
session for approval. We approved five laws yesterday (7 May). 
It is much more productive. Do you know how long it took the 
previous Congress to change the name of Cusco to Qosqo? Three 
days. Can you imagine the country using three days to change 
Cusco to Qosqo? We probably would have needed one hour to do the 
same. 
  [Tafur] Going back to the question that you do not want to 
answer... 
  [Yoshiyama] We earn an average $2,500 per month. You should 
compare this salary with the salary of, say, the general manager 
of EXPRESO -- which I can assure you is much more than $2,500. 
Therefore, I believe we are earning the right amount. Some 
people have said we earn 17,000 sols, but I believe this is 
foolish. But citizens want productive, efficient, and 
hardworking lawmakers. The salary issue has been magnified. It 
should not be a political problem. 
  [Tafur] Lawmaker Torres y Torres Lara maintains that a 
series 
of constitutional amendments like the one dealing with multiple 
electoral districts might be necessary. Is that a majority bloc 
position or simply that lawmaker's idea? 
  [Yoshiyama] That is his own personal idea. I should first 
say 
that we hold lawmaker Torres y Torres Lara in very high regard 
because he is the one who has practically directed the 
constitutional work; that is, his opinions are authoritative. 
The matter, however, has not been debated yet within the NM-C90 
alliance. 
  [Tafur] What do you think about it? 
  [Yoshiyama] We will change a lot of things: the death 
penalty, the Constitutional Guarantee Tribunal, and the method 
for electing the National Council of Magistrates, which will end 
up in chaos the way it is. 
  [Tafur] ...You will enforce such changes despite Dr. 
Ferrero's begin mad about them. 
  [Yoshiyama] What else can we do? Concerning the 
constitutional reforms, over the past three months we have heard 
very authoritative opinions explaining to us how to improve the 
election of members of the National Council of Magistrates and 
the Constitutional Tribunal, the death penalty's enforcement, 
the implementation of the single district, and the cancellation 
of lawmakers' tenures, which we have considered very 
interesting. We have no problem at all admitting that we made 
some mistakes, but we are flexible and willing to consider those 
opinions for a possible amendment of the Constitution. 
  [Tafur] About the electoral issue, is it true that NM-C90 
will not compete, that a new political movement will be created 
for this purpose? 
  [Yoshiyama] No. We have not made any decision about 
electoral 
issues. We have not decided if NM-C90 will compete or if we will 
create another movement. The only thing we want is to make it 
possible for the president to run again. Besides, we are 
convinced that we need strong support from independents if we 
want to succeed in the next election. This is why we have not 
made a decision. Today, to speak the truth, we, and particularly 
the president, are all busy governing the country. I am not sure 
if journalists are aware of how difficult it is to keep pace 
with the president's activities when he is visiting the 
provinces. He works from seven in the morning until three in the 
morning the next day. 
  [Tafur] Are NM-C90 leaders as concerned as some government 
officials about Javier Perez de Cuellar's candidacy? 
  [Yoshiyama] There is still a lot of time, is there not? 
  [Tafur] But you are not concerned? 
  [Yoshiyama] It would be hypocritical to say that I am not 
concerned; but we are taking it calmly. I do not need pills to 
sleep. 
  [Tafur] But the president says he cannot sleep. 
  [Yoshiyama] He does not sleep because he works too hard. 
What 
I mean is that Javier Perez de Cuellar is an excellent 
ambassador and a diplomat. He is attractive because he has great 
international prestige, which might make many things easier for 
him in a future government. A possible negative factor is that 
he is not acquainted with Peruvian problems. 
  [Tafur] Do you not think that statement is rather 
misleading? 
How else could he have helped Fujimori at the beginning if he 
was not acquainted with Peruvian problems? 
  [Yoshiyama] Perhaps I did not express myself well. I said 
Perez de Cuellar has many things in his favor. He is an 
ambassador with great international prestige, but he has to 
update himself on national problems. At this time, he is not up 
to date on national issues because he has lived abroad during 
the past 20 years. That is what I mean. 
  [Tafur] Why do you think people support Perez de Cuellar's 
candidacy? Why is a government such as Fujimori's government, 
which has achieved important things in diverse areas, unable to 
convince the people as much as his accomplishments might lead 
you to imagine they would? 
  [Yoshiyama] People's approval of the president continues to 
be high by all standards. The people are happy with his work. In 
the case of Perez de Cuellar, the people see an image. He is 
practically a stamp. They are comparing an ideal image with a 
real person like Fujimori. Besides, the comparison is being made 
one year before the election. I think it is too early to 
forecast anything. The only thing we know is that Ambassador 
Perez de Cuellar has yet to formally announce whether he will be 
a candidate. The leaders of traditional political parties, 
however, such as the Popular Christian Party, the leftist 
movement, and a group of American Popular Revolutionary Alliance 
followers, already have launched him, involved him. There are 
even discussions on a possible congressional ticket and in some 
places they are forming committees. I think they are using him. 
  [Tafur] Would you accept that Fujimori's biggest 
shortcoming, 
compared to his achievements, is the handling of human rights, 
or at least the handling of reports on human rights violations 
in cases such as the "La Cantuta" or "Huallaga" case? 
  [Yoshiyama] I am not aware of a country where the president 
has had such a high approval rate for so long. There have 
obviously been mistakes and we are determined to correct them. 
For instance, there were some abuses on the issue of human 
rights. In the Upper Huallaga case, it was the Armed Forces' 
duty to enter and eliminate the terrorist groups. Probably, and 
this is being investigated, some Armed Forces members committed 
abuses in isolated instances. It is denigrating to learn that a 
soldier raped someone. It is not a matter of counting to see if 
one or 18 people have been raped or killed. All cases are acts 
of aggression against human rights. These acts must be harshly 
punished. But it is wrong to generalize and involve the entire 
Armed Forces or police in these acts because it turns the issue 
into a political issue. It is also wrong to cover up things. 
  [Tafur] Do you agree with Monsignor Cipriani that all those 
human rights commissions are nonsensical, as he has publicly 
said? 
  [Yoshiyama] No, in no way do I agree. I believe that each 
commission of this type, like the Human Rights Coordinating 
Board, like all human rights groups, does play a role. They 
certainly operate as a counterweight within society. The problem 
begins when there is exaggeration, when groundless statements 
are made. If Monsignor Cipriani said what you are telling me, I 
do not agree with him. 
  [Tafur] If Fujimori were reelected, do you think Commander 
Nicolas de Bari Hermoza should keep his post throughout the 
government term? 
  [Yoshiyama] Ask him. Do not ask me. Work relations between 
two people are known to those two people. It is not only a 
matter of professionalism, but also of personal rapport, of all 
the things that make relations between people so productive. 
  [Tafur] My question obviously was not aimed at the emotional 
side of the relationship. 
  [Yoshiyama] No, I am not talking about that. I am referring 
to the professional side. I hear the news; I read. I believe 
General Hermoza is doing an excellent job in his fight against 
terrorism. I know Hermoza's merits because he is not a general 
who stays at a military building handling documents. He is at 
the battle front. If you read the news, you will learn that 
Hermoza is in Upper Huallaga, in Tarapoto, in Madre de Dios, 
just everywhere. To put it clearly, "it is the master's eye that 
makes the mill go." That is the reason for the successful drug 
enforcement effort. When the history of Peru is written, the 
name of Nicolas de Bari will deserve a special place. But the 
decision is to be made by the president. 
  [Tafur] Will a second Fujimori administration bring anything 
new? Will there be any news from a structural viewpoint, say, in 
terms of a government program? 
  [Yoshiyama] The main problem here is to fight poverty and 
create new jobs. I believe very significant steps forward have 
been taken, but we are still very far from this objective. Major 
reforms have been enforced, but this is over because the reforms 
have already been implemented. We should look at the future, 
continue with the reforms, like in the agricultural sector. We 
will not give up before Peruvian cherimoyas, for example, are 
sold on the international market. A Peruvian cherimoya costs $50 
in Japan. Several things must be corrected. First, land deeds 
should be issued for farmers in order to create a land market; 
second, the Water Law should be thoroughly amended to give water 
the most advantageous use; third, transportation facilities, 
highways, and ports should be improved; and fourth, the dollar 
value should continue to be increased. This project, which seems 
as simple as exporting cherimoyas, calls for several things that 
have not been made yet, which are halfway done and have to be 
made.

  [Text] On 6 May, [Democratic Leftist Movement] Congressman 
Henry Pease demanded that President Alberto Fujimori "take his 
hands off the Armed Forces, and refrain from politicizing them" 
to promote his campaign for reelection, as this greatly harms 
the country. 
  On 18 May, he announced he will insist on his demand for an 
explanation of what happened at the settlement of Querecotillo 
in Piura, where Peruvian Army General Raul Diez, commander of 
the 1st Infantry Division [as published], reportedly got 
involved in an impassioned public harangue in favor of Fujimori. 
  Pease commented that this is not an isolated case, as there 
are several proofs attesting to the government's move in that 
direction, as evinced by the persecution and punishment of 
retired members of the military who have criticized his 
administration. 
  "I am going to insist on my request. The defense minister 
must explain what has happened. The entire country is awaiting 
a response to this request," he said, in an angry tone. He went 
on to say that rather than request that sanctions be applied 
against the military who go out canvassing for votes, he 
demanded explanations. "The entire country, and especially the 
Querotillo settlement, deserves an explanation of what has 
happened," he said. 
  Pease further stated that the rules of the game ought to be 
clear in the next election campaign, and that events such as 
this one should not occur as they inflict much damage to the 
country. "It is not incumbent upon the Armed Forces to compete 
with political parties, as they should abstain from 
participating in the process. That is not their function," he 
noted. 
  He also criticized the ruling party for defeating the motion 
to summon the defense minister to Congress to brief it on what 
has happened. "The majority decided not to summon him because 
they do not want to do anything that may imply they are 
controlling the government. This is why they voted down the 
request that the foreign minister appear before Congress to 
explain the censorship that the president enforced on a foreign 
correspondent," he remarked. 
  Pease recalled that Fujimori himself ordered the erasure of 
some images that had been filmed by a journalist when he visited 
Yanamayo penitentiary in Puno. "What international prestige are 
we talking about when press freedom is restricted in such a way? 
It is preposterous, as that is censorship," he exclaimed. 
  Concerning National Tax Administration Superintendency 
superintendent's unexpected resignation, Pease noted that this 
type of state agency must maintain good administration in order 
to prevent maladjustments. 
  Pease noted that this unexpected replacement may represent a 
political maneuver to reassign a good professional like Sandro 
Fuentes to another area, where he may be required for the 
electoral campaign. Pease pointed out: "The management of 
governmental administration must not become involved in 
political maneuvering. It is necessary to take the country into 
account, and not to have basic aspects in Peru's life become 
involved in political chicanery."

  [Text] Yesterday in a communique, the Northern National 
Security Command Zone denied that officers serving under its 
jurisdiction have engaged in political activities in Sullana. 
The Huancayo Political-Military Zone Command has also reported 
that two Army servicemen were wounded during antisubversive 
operations in the central jungle of Junin Department. 
  Congressman Henry Pease made the allegation that officers 
were engaging in political activities in a motion he proposed in 
Congress on 3 May. Pease said he had received reports from 
several citizens that General Raul Diez, commander of the 
Sullana-based 1st Cavalry Division, accompanied by a group of 
officers and soldiers, attended a meeting on 24-25 April in the 
township of Santa Cruz, which is part of the Querecotillo 
peasant community, to describe projects implemented by National 
Compensation and Social Development Fund and achievements of the 
government's economic policy with a view to earning their 
support for the president's reelection. 
  The military communique adds that Pease's charge was 
highlighted in two issues of a local newspaper. In this 
respect, the communique adds, the Army commander ordered an 
investigation "which concluded that the charge was baseless." 
The communique adds: "Gen. Diez did not go to Santa Cruz on 
24-25 April because he was discharging specific duties during 
those days." 
  The communique notes that a group of officers went to Santa 
Cruz on 25 April in response to an invitation by the president 
of the Self-Defense Committee of Querecotillo, and that "only 
topics related to self-defense committees were discussed at that 
time, and absolutely no political issues whatsoever," proof of 
which are the minutes of the meeting. 
  The communique adds: "The Northern National Security Zone 
Command hereby conveys to the people that the Armed Forces are 
discharging their duties within the precise framework outlined 
by the Peruvian Constitution, and by their own laws and 
regulations; and that their efforts and professionalism are 
committed to the fundamental task of promoting national 
pacification and the implementation of civic actions in favor of 
the most needy towns. It is thus far from our mission and task 
to engage in any activity that could be construed as party 
politics because the raison d'etre of our military institutions 
is the Peruvian nation." 
  The Political-Military Command of the National Central 
Security Subzone No. 7 (Huancayo) has reported that two Army 
servicemen were wounded during antisubversive operations 
conducted by units of the 31st Infantry Division in the central 
jungle Department of Junin. 
  At approximately 0730 on 7 May, an Army patrol engaged 
Shining Path terrorists in the Alto Cachingari region, Satipo 
Province. Sergeant Adalberto Gonzales Manrique was wounded 
during the clash, and was evacuated to the Lima Central Military 
Hospital. 
  At approximately 0800 on 8 May, another Army patrol engaged 
Shining Path members in the area known as Boca Anapate, in the 
Ene River basin, Satipo Province. Infantry Captain Carlos 
Velezmoro Saucedo was wounded during the clash and evacuated to 
the Satipo hospital.

  [Text] Lima, 14 May (EFE) -- Hernando de Soto, president of 
the Freedom and Democracy Institute (ILD), said today that 
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori uses the Armed Forces in 
activities "for which they have not been trained." De Soto told 
the press that when the Armed Forces are used that way "there is 
the risk of contradictions, among them human rights violations, 
corruption over drug trafficking, and the abuse of power and 
authority." 
  De Soto, who was Fujimori's adviser, said in an interview 
with the weekly EL MUNDO that the Peruvian president soon 
realized that "the whip is much more effective than trying to 
coordinate or reach agreement. He is left with the whip in his 
hand which may have given him some short-term results but he has 
not resolved the main problem: A state that governs for very 
few," said de Soto who cooperated with Fujimori during the first 
two years of his government beginning in 1990. 
  He said he was disappointed with Fujimori's administration 
because at the start he represented a government for the great 
majority and placed great emphasis on the democratization of the 
country. He then implemented a system that was "less 
transparent" following the 5 April 1992 self-coup "under the 
pretext of a better democracy." 
  De Soto, the author of "The Other Path," added: "Instead of 
concentrating on the difficult task of reforming a state that 
does not work, he discovered there was, within the state, a 
group of well-disciplined people he could use: the Armed Forces." 
  Hernando de Soto told a local radio station that former UN 
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar would follow a more 
democratic administration than Fujimori "because of his 
tradition of respecting the rules" if he becomes presidential 
candidate for the 1995 general elections. 
  He reiterated that Fujimori had democratic ideals for a long 
time but changed when he realized that "getting his hands on 
resources, based on vertical power and leaning on the Armed 
Forces, resulted in important achievements like his near victory 
over terrorism and his clear triumph over inflation."

  [Text] Last night, the Democratic Constituent Congress 
[CCD] approved, by an ample majority, the top quantities of 
drugs that will, for legal purposes, be considered small 
quantities, as well as early deadlines for certain cases 
involving the crime of drug trafficking. 
  Up to 100 grams of cocaine paste and illegal byproducts, 25 
grams of cocaine hydrochloride, 200 grams of marijuana, and 20 
grams of marijuana byproducts will therefore be the limits for 
`small' quantities, which will determine a prison term of not 
less than two years and not more than eight years, a 365-day 
fine, and disability as established by Article 298 of the Penal 
Code. 
  The same legal standard establishes that, if drugs are 
distributed in small quantities and directly to individual 
consumers who are not chargeable, there will be a prison term of 
not less than one year and not more than four years, a fine 
ranging from 180 to 365 days, and disability. 
  According to its whereas clause, the bill approved last 
night, which was initially remitted by the executive branch and 
subsequently corrected by the CCD Justice Commission, seeks to 
correct the inaccuracy in Article 298 that prompted contentious 
jurisprudence. The bill also establishes a special, expeditious 
trial, which represents a one-sixth reduction of the sentences 
that must be added to the reductions received for confessing a 
crime. 
  Another approved bill involves changing the priority level 
of 
obligations of financial system organizations and savings and 
loan cooperatives when going through a process of dissolution 
and liquidation. The salaries and retirement payments of 
workers in financial system organizations and savings and loan 
cooperatives will, therefore, have immediate priority over the 
deposits of savings account holders now. 
  The CCD session was marked by proposals to send greetings to 
the Panamericana Television Channel "24 Hours" newscast and the 
official gazette EL PERUANO on their 21st and 169th 
anniversaries, respectively.

  [Text] The only place where the MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] still has some strength is in the 
central jungle. There, it has a column that is allegedly headed 
by Nestor Serpa Cartolini himself, and which allegedly has a 
considerable number of weapons, according to two MRTA chiefs 
arrested by the Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] 
and presented to the media on 6 May. 
  The area of influence of this armed group is located between 
La Merced, Satipo, and Pichis, and in the jungle in Junin and 
Pasco Departments. There they continue to carry out attacks, 
although these are not as harmful as those carried out in the 
past. 
  In the January and February issues of the MRTA mouthpiece LA 
VOZ REBELDE, the MRTA claims responsibility for several attacks, 
most of them in the central jungle, a few in the north, and a 
few in Lima. The group that acted in the north, however, was 
deactivated with the arrest of Juan Antonio Leon Montero, also 
known as "Perseo," a member of the MRTA national directorate. 
  The MRTA also suffered harsh blows in Lima, especially last 
month with the Alacran 3 Operation carried out by the second 
Dincote division, which arrested Emilio Villalobos Alva, also 
known as "Celso" or "Polo," and nearly all the members of its 
"Special Forces" -- a detachment that specialized in kidnappings 
and in collecting protection money from businessmen. 
  Dincote said 20 MRTA bases in Peru have been dismantled so 
far. In face of this, MRTA members who no longer have a 
regional command have retreated to Lima and to the Central 
Jungle area, as well as to Jaen and the surroundings of Huancayo. 
  This means there currently remain only four MRTA bastions. 
The main one is in the central jungle. Those in Jaen and 
Huancayo are unstable, and the command in Lima is trying to 
recover the lost time, this time under the command of the number 
two man of the MRTA: Miguel Rincon Rincon. 
  Dincote has said that in general terms, the MRTA forces are 
disbanding. For example, the members of the "Martin La Torre 
Escalante" platoon, which carried out actions south of Peru, 
especially in Puno, are fleeing to Bolivia, where MRTA leader 
Sonia Cuentas supports them. This platoon, which bears the name 
of one of the terrorists who died in the Los Molinos operation 
in 1989, is headed by Justino Soto Vargas, also known as "Lucho 
Chico," among others. The MRTA members who remained in Trujillo 
and Chiclayo have retreated to Jaen. Many MRTA members of Lima 
have also emigrated to Tarma and Junin. 
  According to documents that were found, the MRTA plans to 
take what remains of its military forces to La Convencion 
(Cuzco), and Aguaytia (Ucayali). According to Dincote 
detectives, this is a strategic retreat with the purpose of 
recovering the control of the coca producing zones as well as 
the financing for their actions. 
  Given the action of the forces of order, the MRTA has lost a 
lot of its area of influence at a national level, especially in 
the Huallaga region and in other coca producing zones that 
constituted its emporium and had become its base of actions. 
Now it will be very difficult for the MRTA members to return to 
these zones, not only because of the Armed Force's actions, but 
also because the voids it left were quickly occupied by the 
Shining Path.

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez from the "Investigative Unit"] </F>
  [Text] A report issued by the Interior Ministry General 
Intelligence Directorate (Digimin) last February states that the 
arrest and imprisonment of Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, 
also known as "Vaticano," has not curtailed drug trafficking 
activities. 
  The document states that the creation of new drug stocking 
and dispatch centers, and the transference of drug "firms" to 
new areas is due to the repressive action of the security forces. 
  The report states that Colombian Waldo Simeon Vargas Arias, 
also known as "El Ministro," and the Cachique Rivera brothers 
from Huanuco have occupied the void left by "Vaticano" by 
increasing their operations. "Vaticano's" organizations have 
not been totally dismantled because they are now controlled by 
his brother Elias Chavez Penaherrera, also known as "Cristo." 
  The Digimin report states: "Even though `Vaticano' was 
sentenced to life imprisonment, trafficking increased in Peru 
demonstrating that the organizations and `firms' involved in 
this illegal activity can modify their procedures and change 
their areas of action to avoid being detected." The report was 
distributed to the Armed Forces Joint Command, the National 
Intelligence Service, the Navy, Army, and Air Force Intelligence 
Directorates, and other agencies. 
  The main areas to where the traffickers have moved to avoid 
enforcement actions and to resume their businesses are the 
Tambopata Basin in Madre de Dios, on the border with Brazil, and 
in the northeastern jungle, specifically in Loreto and Ucayali. 
  According to the Digimin document, the "firms" that are 
massively installed in Tambopata Basin use Cusco peasants "to 
transport coca from the Amparaes and Lares valleys (Calca 
Province), Huaros (Quispicanchis Provinces), and Quillabamba (La 
Convencion Province), on a `small scale' basis, by land (road 
and rail) to Juliaca (Puno)." 
  The same "firms," which have turned Boca Manu into one of 
its 
operations center, also collect coca from the higher zones of 
Puno. These leaves "are allegedly processed in maceration pits 
in riverside areas in these provinces and in inaccessible zones 
of Juliaca, where basic and washed coca paste as well as cocaine 
hydrochloride are allegedly being manufactured. This drug is 
then transported by land and sold for consumption in Cusco, 
Arequipa, Moquegua, Tacna, Ica, and Lima as well as in Argentina 
and Chile." 
  The presence of trafficking gangs in the Tambopata Basin, 
Loreto, and other places that will be mentioned later is due to 
the combined action of the Army, National Police, and the DEA in 
Upper Huallaga. 
  Experts warned that the implementation of antinarcotics 
policies based on repression would scatter the "firms" but not 
destroy them. Interior Ministry analysts also acknowledge this, 
admitting that the mafias in Madre de Dios mostly come from the 
Upper Huallaga and Ucayali, especially from Aguaytia and 
particularly from Tambopata River Basin "given its geographical 
location and scarce" police and military "control." 
  The same point of view is expressed in the conclusions of 
the 
document which states: "The pressure exerted by the forces of 
order has caused trafficking activity to (...) move further 
away." 
  Madre de Dios is now "the main stocking center of basic and 
washed coca paste produced in northeastern Peru, as are Cusco 
and Puno, from where it is then transported abroad (to Brazil 
and Colombia)." 
  The "firms" have also moved to the Maranon River Basin from 
the Upper Mayo Valley in San Martin Department, from where they 
send drugs to Chiclayo, Trujillo, Piura, and Tumbes through 
Chiclayo, Olmos, Jaen, Bagua, Rioja, and Moyobamba. 
  The report states that "coca paste production was observed 
to 
have increased gradually there as well as greater stocking in 
Nueva Cajamarca (Rioja and Moyobamba). This increase is 
reflected both in the domestic market (small scale trade) and 
abroad (transported to Ecuador)." 
  The trade, transportation, and manufacturing of drugs has 
increased in these areas, particularly in Celendin, Cajamarca, 
and Luya, Amazon Department, "where Colombian and other foreign 
small planes are observed in the airport of Luya which is 
allegedly the export shipment center." 
  The organization left by "Vaticano," which is now controlled 
by his brother Elias Chavez Penaherrera, also known as "Cristo," 
is allegedly protected by the Shining Path in the Huallaga River 
Basin. 
  The document adds that the "firms" have increased their 
operational levels in Ucayali, especially in Ayatala and Padre 
Abad Provinces and in the towns of Tamaya and Pachitea where 
basic and washed coca paste are manufactured to then transfer it 
to Pichis Palcazu from where it allegedly is transported to 
Brazil. 
  Recent antinarcotic operations in Pichis Palcazu forced the 
"firms" out toward Zona Balta, Puerto Esperanza, and San 
Bernardo, in Puros Province, Ucayali. 
  Just two weeks ago, LA REPUBLICA published a report on 
activities in the Pichis Palcazu valley. We discovered that the 
area had been turned into a new operations center by traffickers 
who previously operated in Upper Huallaga. 
  Regarding the Apurimac-Ene Basin, the document says: "Coca 
producing peasants in the Ene and Perene River valleys, in 
Satipo Province, Junin, and Pichis Palcazu-Oxampampa Province, 
in Pasco; as well as peasants from the Apurimac River valleys in 
Huanta and La Mar Provinces, Ayacucho, and Conception Province, 
in Cusco, have increased their plantations. In these zones, 
traffickers have involved coca producers in their illegal trade. 
Peasants now build maceration pits near rivers and are 
manufacturing basic and washed coca paste." 
  The drug that is produced here, with that sent from 
Huallaga, 
is traded in Palmapampa in the Apurimac valley. This is the 
"main collection center. From here drugs for domestic 
consumption are distributed by land to the capital and other 
important cities (Huancayo, Pisco, Ica, Arequipa, Cusco) and 
shipped toward the Colombian and Brazilian borders by air." 
  Clandestine strips for shipping drugs have been fully 
identified in Luisiana, Palmapampa, Palestina, Puerto Mayo, 
Valle Esmeralda, and Iscozazin. Digimin analysts said there are 
Army and Air Force bases near the clandestine strips of Luisiana 
and Palmapampa but the other strips are not controlled at all. 
  Trafficking activities have increased in the so-called 
central axis -- comprising roads leading to Lima and the main 
coastal, central, and southern cities -- particularly in Ica. 
  One of the projections being handled by Digimin is that 
"trafficking organizations will try to counter their recent 
setbacks by creating new centers of collection and shipping, 
thus spreading the police coverage and reducing their 
efficiency." 
  Another option being analyzed by experts is that 
"trafficking 
organizations, due to the quality of the coca in Huallaga, will 
continue to evade police controls by transporting the drug by 
land or by river to areas outside the control of the forces of 
order and close to airstrips that have been abandoned or are not 
controlled. Here the drug can be manufactured and shipped 
abroad." 
  The document does not specify the amount of drugs 
transported 
by the "firms," the number of drug flights, or the number of 
military or police personnel who cooperate with traffickers. 
  The report says, however, that interdiction has increased 
sharply. During February, the police seized 186 kg of cocaine, 
3,713 kg of washed coca paste, and 8 kg of cocaine and arrested 
245 individuals in 119 operations, most of them in the Maranon 
basin. 
  The antinarcotic forces are now seeking to capture and 
disable the organizations headed by Waldo Vargas Arias and the 
Cachique Rivera brothers. "(Vaticano's) capture has left a gap 
which his main competitors, `The Minister' and the Cachique 
Rivera brothers, are seeking to exploit," the report states. 
Both "firms" work for the powerful Cali cartel, which is 
responsible for 80 percent of the drugs entering the United 
States. 
  The police have hit the Cachique Rivera group the hardest. 
Five houses in Lima were raided, four laboratories were 
destroyed, and 15 accomplices were arrested. Just a month ago, 
Antinarcotics Directorate officials captured Margarita Cachique 
Rivera, the "firm's" contact with foreign buyers in Lima and who 
guaranteed the supply of precursors to elaboration centers in 
the jungle. 
  "The Minister" once again escaped from a combined police, 
Army, and DEA operation in Lagunas, Loreto Department, during 
March. He has an airstrip in the area.

  [Excerpt] After arriving in our country to settle the 
details, Bolivian Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Gumucio announced 
that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will make an 
official visit to Peru. According to the Bolivian official, the 
Bolivian president will arrive in Lima on 5 July. Diplomatic 
sources indicated that Sanchez de Lozada's visit will be an 
opportunity to promote mutual cooperation and integration. 
  The confirmation of such an important visit was made by the 
Bolivian vice foreign minister at a time when there is a lot of 
interest in Peru to increase trade ties that began with the 
installation of an industrial free zone in the port of Ilo. 
  The Foreign Ministry has also reported that President 
Alberto 
Fujimori has officially invited Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria to visit the country. In a letter he sent to Gaviria, 
Fujimori highlights the close ties that unite the two nations. 
The invitation was made as a result of the visit Fujimori made 
to Bogota in February. [passage omitted]

for electoral freedom? 
  [Lacalle] The decision to support departmental 
constitutional 
reform, because this is a reform of the departmental 
governments, has a scope for us that surpasses being a mere 
episode of the reform, and it is an endeavor to get the country 
moving toward a harmony that will help it achieve electoral 
freedom. 
  The last century opened with a struggle among us for 
electoral freedom, something essential for the National Party. 
The 1870, 1897, and 1904 revolutions were not carried out in 
order to take power, to overthrow the Colorado government; they 
were carried out to obtain voting guarantees. We wanted to vote 
freely and with guarantees. 
  This was being achieved until 1925 when the Election Law 
that 
was implemented by the Electoral Court closed the cycle for 
seeking voting guarantees. 
  We can say without making a mistake that since 1925 we have 
had complete voting guarantees and someone has said, not without 
reason, that the revolution's objectives were obtained in 1925. 
  Then, another stage begins. We have the profuse legislation 
on the Lema Law [intra-party tickets], or Lema Laws because 
there is more than one, which gives us our current system. 
  We then go from the one and only list and ticket of the 1951 
Constitution to departmental separation but within the same lema 
in the 1966 reform. Now this new reform is being attempted. Now 
the end of the century finds us facing a situation in which it 
is notorious that the voter does not have full freedom. 
  [EL PAIS] Why do you say this? 
  [Lacalle] Because the simultaneous double vote is in a 
certain sense a restriction of the popular will; because the 
citizen in legal fiction says he votes for a certain party and 
that within this party he prefers a certain candidate, but it is 
the party that he really prefers. 
  Why is it that we talk about electoral freedom when 
departmental reform comes up for discussion? Because we give the 
voter another option. 
  The voter can combine his departmental option with his 
national option; in other words, there is more freedom, there 
are more options. Thus, the voter will combine one party with 
another one by taking into consideration the management ability 
more than party loyalty. 
  We believe this option within the constitutional reform is 
the most adequate one at this time because at this time we begin 
to commit our influence and political force as soon as the new 
government is installed to begin a campaign for achieving 
greater freedom. 
  We have observed that people have moved from one party to 
another, and we believe that mechanisms must be sought that will 
allow the voter to vote for his party at one level and for the 
government at another. 
  It is also true that we propose using some of the points 
contained in the last frustrated reform to help us with our 
commitment. 
  [EL PAIS] In order to make it clear for the people. A 
constitutional reform is going to be voted on in November and if 
it is successful your idea will go into effect at that time? 
  [Lacalle] Of course. Of course. The two systems must be 
voted 
for simultaneously. For the system that is being proposed and 
for the current system. 
  [EL PAIS] The same as in the 1971 elections? 
  [Lacalle] Yes, exactly.

  [Text] Today, Ecuador paid international banks the first 
$25 million of overdue interest, thus beginning to comply with 
an agreement whereby this amount must be paid two weeks after 
the refinancing announcement was made on 3 May. Government 
sources said that another $25 million, equivalent to $5 million 
monthly for overdue interest from January to May, will be 
disbursed in three days. The amount is due before Friday. 
  Two weeks ago, the Ecuadoran Government agreed to refinance 
the country's commercial debt of $7.5 billion over a 30-year 
period with a 15-percent write off with banks. This operation 
will make it possible for the country to refinance its debt with 
the Paris Club and other lending organizations. 
  Ecuador's total debt borders on $13 billion, Latin America's 
largest per capita. The $13-billion debt is equivalent to $1,000 
for each of the country's 13 million inhabitants. Shortly before 
reaching this agreement with the creditor banks, President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen paid $5 million in April as a gesture of good faith 
and seriousness, Finance Minister Cesar Robalino reported at the 
time. With this payment, Ecuador ended a 20-month delay in the 
payment of overdue interest, which had accumulated up to a total 
of $2.5 billion since 1987. As for the remaining principal, 
approximately $5 billion, the country will choose among several 
alternatives proposed.

  [Text] "Not only has corruption become widespread in the 
country in recent decades, but it has also become 
institutionalized, and, although only informally, it is 
regulated." This statement was made by the Andean Center for 
Popular Action (CAAP) in the course of an investigation that 
brings us closer to an understanding of the scope of this 
worrisome phenomenon. 
  According to the CAAP, "commissions" absorb about 6.9 
percent 
of the state budget -- almost 7 percent -- and the regulation 
process has reached a point at which "both those involved and 
careful observers know exactly what amount or what percentage of 
`commission' must be paid out or received by a bureaucrat for 
any given type of procedure." At the same time, there are 
"bureaucratic rings" -- veritable bribe 
approval-payment-acceptance chains -- without which the system 
could not function. 
  The CAAP says it is interesting to note that as of December 
1993, there were in the nation's prisons only 42 inmates 
convicted of crimes against the public administration and 38 
convicted for embezzlement. But corruption is not found among 
government employees alone. The percentages of taxes evaded by 
private businesses are also "regulated." 
  As the CAAP sees it, the impoverishment of broad sectors of 
the population of Ecuador is expressed and can be measured by 
three new parameters. They are crime (which we analyzed 
yesterday), corruption, and the growing lack of respect for 
human rights. The challenge involves finding a way to combat 
corruption on both the public and private levels. 
  On the initiative of the vice president of the Republic, the 
government has contracted for the services of a business called 
"International Honesty," with a view to the launching of a plan 
to combat corruption. However, whenever an effort is made to 
resolve a structural crisis by means of a morality campaign, 
limitations appear, according to analysts who deal with the 
dramatic subject of corruption in Ecuador. 
  Can the monetary sum being absorbed by corruption in our 
country be calculated? The CAAP has decided that it can. It has, 
therefore, using the incipient institutionalization of this 
phenomenon seen in recent decades as a basis, made a study of 
the magnitude of the sums involved in corruption on the public 
and private levels. 
  Starting with the clear "rules of the game" governing the 
processes of corruption today, the CAAP study considered the 
state budget figures for 1993. The expenditure categories were 
used to measure the corruption in the state apparatus, while the 
income categories made it possible to calculate the extent of 
corruption on the private level. 
<H5>  Government Corruption </H5>
  According to the CAAP study, 6.9 percent of the general 
budget of the Republic "drains" through the hands of 
unscrupulous bureaucrats within the state institutional 
apparatus and/or the private sector. In order to reach this 
figure, the investigators established first of all what would be 
called a "useful base for corruption" made up of the various 
expenditure categories (salaries, services, supplies, etc.) in 
the codified budget, which was taken to be the total volume 
vulnerable to corruption. Secondly, the national average for the 
"commissions" absorbed by government employees and officials out 
of the national budget, by category and ministry, was determined. 
  According to the CAAP, three conclusions can be derived from 
the above. 

  -  The simple average of the commissions that must 
be paid to the bureaucracy for various purposes, or in other 
words the "diversion rate," is estimated to amount to about 15 
percent of the budget. 
  -  Where the commission percentages by 
expenditure category are concerned, that for "services" proved 
to be the largest (33 centavos for every sucre of expenditure 
vulnerable to diversion), followed by "supplies" (20.6 percent), 
"construction" (16.2 percent), purchases of "goods and chattels" 
(15.5 percent), "purchases of furnishings" (13.3 percent), 
"transfers" (9.8 percent), "remuneration" (one percent), and 
public debt (2.3 percent, for the foreign debt). 
  -  Provisionally, 
the ministries believed to have the highest average commission 
rates are Education and Agriculture, with averages exceeding 18 
percent. 

  Once these aspects have been reviewed, it is possible to 
calculate the amounts diverted to the personal accounts of a 
myriad of bureaucrats. To this end, the amount in each 
expenditure category is multiplied by the "commission rate," and 
by the percentage that in practice is vulnerable to diversion. 
  By means of this procedure, the investigators came to the 
conclusion that 291.3368 billion sucres (about $155 million) 
were drained off in this way from the expenditures originally 
planned and approved in 1993. In relative terms, this amount is 
equivalent to 6.9 percent of the total budget, and to 1.1 
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) for 1993. 
  "Up to the present, obviously, public corruption has taken 
into account only the monies incorporated in the state budget 
proper. Thus the sums derived from the private sector that go to 
fill bureaucrats' pockets have not been included. It is, as yet, 
impossible to make a quantitative determination of this total, 
since it involves commissions ranging from payments to a 
policeman in order to avoid a fine, through the corruption of 
judges, all the way up to Christmas gifts," the CAAP 
investigators have explained. 
<H5>  The Private Sector </H5>
  Although it is generally believed that the greater part of 
the existing corruption is to be found in the public sector in 
our Latin American countries, there is no doubt that this 
practice, and immorality in general, play a major role in the 
private sector of our economies. 
  The CAAP investigation in this sector was limited to the 
issue of tax evasion, and the figures provided by high-ranking 
government officials themselves (in public statements) were 
used. The researchers began with the tax income collected 
throughout 1993, and this was compared with the income that 
would have been collected by the government had this mass tax 
evasion not occurred. 
  According to the CAAP, if the values that were not taken 
into 
account, but which can be estimated roughly, were added in the 
course of this operation, the result would be an approximate 
total for corruption equal to 9.5 percent of the GDP, including 
the estimates that were not realized.

  [Excerpt] Caracas, 18 May (DPA) -- In a decision 
unprecedented in Venezuela, the Supreme Court decided in a 10 to 
four vote today to issue an arrest warrant against former 
President Carlos Andres Perez and Alejandro Izaguirre and 
Reinaldo Figueredo, ministers during the Perez administration, 
on charges of embezzling $17 million from a secret slush fund. 
  The historic decision, announced by Supreme Court President 
Roberto Yepes Boscan, paves the way for a regular trial against 
Perez, twice president of Venezuela and former Socialist 
International vice president, for embezzlement, presumably 
committed at the beginning of his second administration in 
February 1989. 
  In an unexpected move, Perez went to the Supreme Court "to 
obey the law" with former Interior Minister Izaguirre. Former 
Presidency Secretariat Minister Figueredo is either in the 
United States or in the UK, according to his lawyers. 
  The former president, who is 71, said upon arriving at the 
Supreme Court that the order was a "political decision." On 20 
May 1993, the Supreme Court separated Perez from the presidency 
to begin a "pretrial of merits" for the same case in a judicial 
action that is unprecedented in modern Venezuelan history. 
  The former president was arrested by the Judicial Technical 
Police and will be held in El Junquito Jail outside Caracas. 
Perez's detention marks another political landmark as he was 
elected president on a wave of popularity in 1974 and 1989 and 
portrayed himself as a charismatic leader with Third World 
connections, heading various international forums for 
South-South cooperation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Freddy Torres] </F>
  [Text] An old, weary Francisco Javier Jimenez, Commander 
Ruperto, chief of the Americo Silva Guerrilla Front, has left 
the Anzoategui Mountains where he spent the past 32 years 
resisting successive democratic governments. Although he has 
said farewell to arms, he affirmed that he was not surrendering. 
  "We are beginning another revolution in the streets, joining 
the people. There was nothing left to do in the mountains," he 
explained. 
  Accompanied by 100 men who have laid down their weapons and 
are now seeking power through peaceful means, Commander Ruperto 
noted that he was hopeful the people will support the Red Flag's 
political program. 
  That organization tried to gauge its strength in the past 
presidential elections by endorsing the candidacy of Gabriel 
Puerta Aponte of the Popular Democratic Movement, but the 
group's participation did not win it any elected office. 
  Ahead lies the arduous work of overcoming that defeat, 
winning the support of the people, and facing the big party 
machines in an area the group does not control and which it is 
entering without significant changes in its language, which 
remains orthodox. 
  The guerrilla represents a superseded phase that kept 
activists apart from "the masses," Commander Ruperto 
acknowledged. 
  The guerrilla chief does not deny that the leader of the 
Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro, financed the Venezuelan 
guerrillas, at least during its most active years. "We did 
receive economic assistance when we were MIR [Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left], but that has not been the case for many 
years. At any rate, we are deeply grateful for that aid. 
  The Front took its name from Americo Silva, a guerrilla 
killed in Guayana in 1971 in a clash with the National Guard. 
Its operations center was in Anzoategui and Sucre States. 
  Another member of the group is well-known Commander Gabriel 
Puerta Aponte, who has a long history of armed struggle. It is 
he who influenced the group's decision to demobilize the armed 
Red Flag groups and engage in political activities in the 
streets. 
  Commander Ruperto said the decision to abandon the armed 
struggle was made in response to the different political 
conditions under the President Rafael Caldera administration. 
  The guerrilla leader, who said he spent his life fighting, 
reading, and preaching a revolution during his 32 years in the 
mountains, notes that with President Caldera, the pioneer of the 
peace policy of the 1970's, there is a new political picture. 
  As an example he mentioned President Caldera's dismissal of 
charges against the officers who participated in the two coup 
attempts. 
  Commander Ruperto confessed that he did not experience any 
culture shock upon returning to the city because for the past 
few years he maintained occasional contact with it, even though 
he rigorously observed security precautions and took special 
care to conceal his true identity. The man, who claims to have 
experience in this type of thing, founded along with Americo 
Silva (1965) the first Red Flag guerrilla front in Maturin. 
  He has five children, some of whom inherited his ideas but 
not his fighting style. 
  He left his wife for the guerrillas but admits that a man 
and 
a woman need each other in more ways than one. It was for women 
that he occasionally abandoned his hideouts. He said he is a 
human being no different from the rest. "I left the mountains on 
many occasions because of the women, but I found my true passion 
in the mountains," says this peasant, who does not think he 
wasted his time by dedicating three decades to the armed 
struggle. 
  Commander Ruperto readily admits that "the people no longer 
want guerrilla actions or military coups." 
  The Red Flag leader now says that "the people are mobilizing 
themselves in the streets in defense of their rights and to 
confront the vast array of socioeconomic problems resulting from 
the crisis. The struggle is being waged in the cities, not in 
the mountains." 
  The old guerrilla leader asks: How are we going to do it if 
we want the people to know about the political program we offer 
the country? 
  He asks: Are we going to achieve that goal by continuing the 
armed struggle in the isolated mountains with no access to the 
people? 
  We will now take to the streets. We are going to come into 
contact with the people and explain this program of change. Our 
goal is to convince the people to adopt our program. 
  Ruben Gonzalez, another member of the Americo Silva 
Guerrilla 
Front, admits that their efforts never achieved a national 
character but said he is pleased with the work done by the 
peasants and workers of Anzoategui and Sucre States. 
  "We are demobilizing because the people are demanding deep 
changes," he said. "Caldera came to power as an expression of a 
desire for change and thanks to the unity of the people who 
demanded change." 
  Gonzalez claims that the "Caracazo" [violent looting and 
disturbances in February 1989 after President Carlos Andres 
Perez decreed stringent economic measures] and the two coup 
attempts in which Red Flag activists participated are the result 
of a desire for change in the country. 
  "We came to make our contribution toward change," he said. 
"We could not have achieved that with our weapons in the 
mountains." 
  The commander explained that "revolutionaries do not choose 
their system of struggle; it is determined by the country's 
political situation." 
  The demobilized guerrilla commanders are talking about the 
need to convene a constituent assembly to implement the 
unpostponable reforms the people hope for. 
  They favor a judicial branch that can effectively fight 
corruption. They condemn the successive frauds such as those at 
Recadi [Differential Exchange System] and Banco Latino. 
  Even though they say that the armed struggle has not been 
entirely ruled out, they claim to have joined the project for 
peaceful change and ask President Rafael Caldera's 
administration to promote and convene a constituent assembly. 
  These men, who were demobilized only three days ago in a 
ceremony attended by Sucre Governor Ramon Martinez, church 
authorities, and congressmen, demand that the government draft a 
policy of social justice, economic development, and 
democratization of society. 
  The Red Flag leaders deny they have any responsibility for a 
plan to disrupt public order and claim that the student 
demonstrations shaking Caracas are an expression of the 
"people's just struggle." 
  "They are typical expressions of the revolutionary movement 
in which we live, characterized by the impoverishment of the 
lower classes and by the impunity enjoyed by corrupt officials," 
they said. 
  The demobilized guerrillas maintain that the organizations 
fighting for change in the country cannot remain isolated from 
one another. 
  "Circumstances demand that we join the struggle 
spontaneously 
begun by the Venezuelan people," they said. 
  Commanders Ruperto and Gonzalez made a call on other 
political forces (Third Path, Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement, 
and so on) to join the civic, peaceful, and democratic struggle. 
  "No one wants violence any more," they said.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News"] </F>
  [Text] The finance minister explained that he hopes the IMF 
mission, which will begin a two-week visit on Tuesday to discuss 
with Venezuelan experts the behavior of the economy in the first 
100 days of the current administration, will issue a 
satisfactory appraisal of the measures taken. He admitted that 
differences of opinion might arise over the nonapplication of 
the VAT [value-added tax] and the increase in gasoline prices, 
which, he reiterated, might take place at the beginning of 1995 
following a study on subsidies for mass transportation. Sosa 
Rodriguez said that if the IMF concludes that the international 
reserves have been handled correctly, it would have a very 
positive psychological effect on the country's economy. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] Our reserves are at quite a 
satisfactory level. It is true that operational reserves have 
dropped this year, but they are at a satisfactory level for any 
country. Now then, because we have a type of psychosis coupled 
with a destabilization process involving rumors, telephone 
calls, and so forth, there is speculation in the market. 
Obviously, if we had the IMF backing us, those speculators or 
rumormongers would have a more difficult time. [end recording] 
  [Briceno] The minister also said the slight upsurge in 
petroleum prices, which will bring approximately 100 billion 
bolivares in revenue, will have a favorable effect next year and 
in 1996 to balance the fiscal deficit. The finance minister also 
said the World Bank has recommended that some of its experts 
advise FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] 
and the Banking Superintendency in resolving the management 
problems of the banks that are being assisted and that are now 
owned by the state.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 17 May. 
  Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez has announced that 
Venezuela became a member of the Multilateral Investment 
Guarantees Agency (MIGA) on 6 May by paying the $3,088,038 that 
corresponds to the 20-percent subscription fee. By joining MIGA, 
Venezuela acquires more guarantees in the flow of foreign 
investment. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 10 May 94 p 12) 
  The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) reported on 10 May that 
the 
people have no need to fear an unstable bolivar, because the 
drop in international reserves has been curbed. BCV President 
Antonio Casas said, "There is no reason not to have faith in the 
bolivar and in the country's economic future." The dollar 
experienced a setback on 29 April when the bolivar rose from 
118.30 per dollar to 123.50. On 10 May, the bolivar closed at 
131.50. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0112 GMT 11 May 94) 
  Foreign Trade Institute President Alberto Poletto has 
announced that the abrupt break in trade talks between Colombia, 
Mexico, and Venezuela to form a trade zone under the Group of 
Three "does not mean the end or failure of the negotiations." 
The foreign trade ministers of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela 
will strive in the coming days to overcome the impasse created 
in Bogota when Mexico tried to impose conditions the other two 
countries did not accept. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in 
Spanish 11 May 94 p 20) 
  Finance Ministry sources have reported that imports have 
experienced a 40-percent decline. It is estimated that in 1994 
exports will reach 10.2-10.5 billion dollars, compared to 1993's 
10.9 billion dollar figure. According to the same sources, in 
1993 the country sustained an economic reduction of 1 percent, 
which is expected to reach 1.5 percent in 1994. (Caracas EL 
NACIONAL in Spanish 11 May 94 p E-2) 
  During the first three months of 1994, Venezuela experienced 
a slowdown characterized by spiraling inflation and declines in 
the basic economic indicators. This is reflected in an economic 
report prepared by the Presidency's Office of Coordination and 
Planning. The price of oil, which is a touchstone used to assess 
the country's revenues, was $12.33 per barrel, showing a 
4.8-percent decline when compared to prices recorded in the last 
three months of 1993. (Caracas Union Radion Network in Spanish 
1100 GMT 17 May 94)

  [Text] Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, leader of the opposition 
Dominican Revolutionary Party [PRD], who had reported fraud in 
the 16 May elections held in the Dominican Republic, said today 
that he has a civilian army ready to prevent an election farce. 
  We do not accept the results provided by the Central 
Electoral Board, which gives a slight advantage to President 
Joaquin Balaguer, Pena Gomez said in a television program. He 
also demanded a review of all vote tally sheets. 
  Pena Gomez also referred to his remarks during the 1994 
elections, when he said that fraud must be proven before a call 
for violence could be made. 
  In a letter addressed to the Central Electoral Board, Jose 
Francisco Pena Gomez demands the suspension of the vote count 
due to the despicable, serious irregularities detected during 
the process. If the vote count continues, Balaguer would be 
proclaimed president, he said. 
  Moreover, Chilean Luis Ayala, chairman of Socialist 
International for Latin America, has denounced serious 
irregularities in the general elections held on Monday [16 May] 
in the Dominican Republic. 
  In a news conference, Ayala supported the denunciations made 
by the PRD presidential candidate who said he would be present 
today at the Central Electoral Board to refute the process and 
demand new elections in those districts where thousands of 
citizens were unable to vote. 
  Luis Ayala added that Socialist International delegates, in 
the Dominican Republic to observe the elections at the 
invitation of Pena Gomez, have detected serious and grave 
irregularities. Ayala added that citizens linked to Balaguer's 
government had two identification cards. 
  Balaguer was leading when the latest vote count results were 
announced.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Violeta Chamorro to the nation at the </F>
National Unity Room of the Presidential House in Managua -- live] 
  [Text] Dear Nicaraguans: On 25 April 1990, when I was 
sworn in as president of the country, I addressed all of you 
from the National Stadium and I said that the four pillars of a 
democratic republic for all to be free and equal before the law, 
are: 
  First: the exercise of democratic liberties; 
  Second: the utmost promotion of economic production; 
  Third: the reduction of social inequity; 
  Fourth: to work with a spirit of peace, unity, and national 
reconciliation. 
  During these past four years we have been working toward the 
objectives I mentioned that first day. In the government 
program I outlined for the people, I established the commitment 
that the Armed Forces would have a professional nature and would 
not belong to any political party. However, on that day also, I 
committed myself to putting an end to the war and to 
consolidating peace; to reducing the Army; and to placing the 
Armed Forces under the civilian authority of the president. 
  Ever since that April morning we have been working on these 
objectives. We have been able to reduce the size of the Army 
from 84,000 men and women to only 14,000, thus turning it into 
the smallest army in Central America. As a result of this 
reduction in military expenditures, we have been able to 
increase investments for repairing and building schools and 
health centers. 
  Today I am very happy to send to the National Assembly the 
Bill on Military [word indistinct] and Organization, 
Jurisdiction, [words indistinct], popularly known as the 
Military Law. This bill contains three essential military 
points: It establishes guidelines that ensure compliance with 
the functions of the Armed Forces, their professionalism, and 
their nonpolitical nature. 
  The most important aspect of this bill is that once it is 
promulgated, Nicaragua will have, for the first time in its 
history, an army clearly subordinated to civilian power, 
committed to the Constitution, and it will not belong or submit 
itself to the interests of any political party or social class. 
Behind us now are the years of armies that belonged to groups 
or parties and that made the birth of democracy in Nicaragua so 
laborious. Today we are opening the doors to an Army of all the 
Nicaraguans. It will be done so that we never lose the 
democracy that has been won. 
  It was difficult and hard to bring about the agreement with 
the Army. Never before in the history of Nicaragua had the 
civilian and military leaders of the country worked to draft 
laws that would guarantee civilian supremacy over the military. 
The work was hard and the road the government and the Army had 
to walk to reach this point was lengthy, but the commitment that 
both institutions have with a democratic and unified Nicaragua, 
conquered distrust and [word indistinct]. 
  We have also agreed on appointing the new commander in chief 
of our nation's Army before the end of the year, just as I have 
announced on several occasions. This appointment will be made 
on 21 December of this year. This means that following the 
conclusion of the two-month transition established in Article 9 
of this code, the new commander will be sworn in on 21 February 
1995, the centennial anniversary year of the birth of General 
Augusto Cesar Sandino, and on that day General Humberto Ortega 
will retire. 
  Dear Nicaraguans, on that 25 April I told you that Nicaragua 
was inviting us to bury not its children who die in fraticidal 
wars, but to bury, forever, weapons, so that the muzzles of 
cannons roar no more, as our National Anthem demands. The 
divided, poor, and conflict-ridden Nicaragua we received on that 
day, is being left behind forever. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Statement by Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate of the </F>
Conservative Party; place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Good afternoon. I am going to speak sincerely and 
directly, face to face with you, about the changes I will make 
if you elect me as your president on 29 May. I am going to tell 
you about my plans to make Colombia a nation of opportunities 
where we can be sure of getting a good education, being able to 
walk the streets safely, and finding a decent job. 
  Studies have been under way for quite some time now to 
determine the causes of the problems faced by Colombian society 
today. No one has had the courage to admit that real change 
begins by recovering the family unit. We all have the right to 
belong to a family in which we can learn the right values and 
principles and develop a sense of coexistence and solidarity. 
It is essential to protect the development of our children, to 
guide our youths, and to aid our parents in their role. If 
parents do not know how to feed and educate their children, if 
we cannot satisfy their basic needs, if the least little illness 
becomes life threatening, if there is no roof over their head, 
that family will be devoured by frustration, resentment, 
conflict, uncertainty, and neglect. I say this clearly, and you 
know it is so. That is how many, a great many Colombians live. 
  Real social policy comes from an understanding of family 
problems. That is why I insist on education. All parents know 
their child is intelligent. They dream of a better world for 
their offspring and know that if they can get an education it 
will guarantee their future and they will not be forced to live 
a life of deprivation. 
  Education. Knowledge will be the main asset of the 21st 
century. It is our guarantee for looking toward the future with 
optimism. It is the only source of security we can leave our 
children without worrying about someone taking it away from 
them. Alas, there are many children who will never get an 
education. There are too many who have not been given the master 
key to be someone and to make their mark. That is not fair. We 
cannot pay the parents of this country for their efforts with 
the pain of seeing their child denied the right to a future. 
  My great purpose, my great dream, my great pledge is for 
every Colombian child to go to school and get an education. We 
must not deny anyone this first opportunity, which will allow us 
to live in a better society. The wisdom of the street says a 
stitch in time saves nine. If our children get an education, we 
will no longer see the painful sight of the street children 
[gamines], the junior hit man, the army of small fries selling 
candy or cigarettes at traffic lights. 
  There will be education during my administration because I 
want a future. Those who do not understand this do not want to 
solve the problem but to perpetuate it. I am determined to end 
this conflict once and for all. It is impossible for those who 
have only experienced rejection to be on the side of peace, 
solidarity, coexistence, or democracy. To do this I will become 
a constant ally of the nation's parents. I will be an ally for 
the teachers who choose to ride with us on this crusade for 
guaranteed education. This education must be comprehensive and 
high-quality. Let us teach our parents to be good parents and 
our teachers to be excellent teachers. We cannot fool our 
children, parents, and society with poor education. It is not 
fair for parents to invest their resources in something that 
will not help their children live better lives. There is a 
painful relationship between lack of education and unemployment. 
There is another painful relationship between poor education 
and poor employment. 
  A second demand pertains to personal safety and the recovery 
of our right to live without fear. We must not let ourselves be 
cornered. We must recover public places for Colombians. We 
cannot live happily while wondering if our children will make it 
home, if father or mother will be robbed, or if our children are 
safe while we are at work. One cannot conceive of a government 
that is incapable of guaranteeing security, peace, and peace of 
mind for its citizens in their daily lives. Murder and assault 
are on the rise, as are burglary, mugging, and car theft. Every 
day we feel crime getting closer. Today the victim is just 
someone we know; tomorrow it could be a neighbor, a relative, or 
-- God forbid -- our own children. As I see it, there is a 
painful relationship between a community that arms itself and 
government inefficiency. 
  The former governments have mistakenly believed that 
guerrillas and narcotraffickers are the only ones who deserve 
attention from the state, thus neglecting daily security. That 
is why I have proposed the creation of a specialized group, so 
that just as groups that counter guerrillas, kidnappings, and 
narcotrafficking, it can dedicate itself to dismantling and 
breaking up, once and for all, the mafia of common criminals, 
who disrupt the citizens' tranquillity in the country's main 
cities. 
  It is critical that we support the prosecutor general's 
work to definitively eliminate impunity. Nothing is more 
infuriating or frustrating than to see crimes go unpunished and 
criminals mocking their victims because they know they will not 
be punished. Even worse is the scenario where a victim, the 
citizen, is mistreated by a bureaucratized, inoperative, and 
inefficient justice system. For example, a citizen files 
charges and fails to recover stolen goods but must fear 
retribution from the thief he identified. We must guarantee 
citizens that they will receive prompt and full justice through 
fair punishment of the criminal. 
  Our personal safety is now jeopardized by the Constitutional 
Court's ruling on the legality of specific drug quantities for 
personal use. This is unacceptable and inconceivable. We 
cannot allow them to bury our dream of a better Colombia. As a 
parent, I cannot accept this and you cannot either because we 
want healthy children and young people. I do not want those who 
represent our future to fall under the effects of narcotics. I 
will not allow them to murder our future. I do not want to see 
the criminal selling drugs or killing our efforts to restore 
values, family, education, and everyday safety. No to drugs! I 
have always said this and will always say it: I will not budge! 
  I am not one of those who today says no to the court's 
decision but who yesterday was one of the ones who proposed 
legalization. Or do they believe that the marijuana of 15 years 
ago was less harmful than the kind consumed in the streets 
today? What nonsense! No to drugs! Following the legalization 
of the personal dosage comes the legalization of drug 
trafficking. Let us not be mistaken about that. In this 
struggle against the killers of our future, we have paid a high 
price in lives, kidnappings, and grief. That cost will not be 
fruitless. No parent who really loves his children, no teacher 
who values his students, no Colombian who thinks about Colombia 
can agree with those who favor legalization. I will not permit 
it. 
  In the same vein, I want to be clear and categorical: The 
guerrillas are the ones who declared war on Colombians. The 
state is responsible for protecting the lives, honor, and 
property of all Colombians. I will therefore support the 
military and police forces in their relentless pursuit of those 
who insist on undermining the institutions and attacking 
Colombians. 
  I have told the subversives that we Colombians want to know 
what they want. We must consider their needs, but that should 
not be construed as a sign of weakness. It is an opportunity 
for them to voice their concerns. They are already aware of the 
vigorous position the next government will assume in enforcing 
respect for the state of law. 
  I vigorously reiterate that I am not willing to hold a 
dialogue for the sake of holding a dialogue. I am willing to 
negotiate personally once I know in print what the guerrillas 
want. If they decide not to speak clearly to the Colombians, we 
will continue to enforce the law to the letter throughout the 
country without indulgences or concessions. 
  I am also convinced that the economy is not an end in itself 
but a means, if properly used, to help us improve the well-being 
of all Colombians. 
  Some people believe that economic development pertains only 
to large industries. Employment and companies, employment and 
production, employment and education go hand in hand. A good 
business policy is also a good employment policy. A policy that 
favors production must also favor employment. A policy of 
quality production generates quality jobs and demands quality 
education. 
  I have this in mind when I say that I profess and defend a 
social market economy because it must produce social effects 
that are reflected in more and better jobs, in better salaries 
that allow workers and their families to lead dignified, 
carefree lives, in high-quality production, in access to 
adequate markets, and in the procurement of an efficient social 
security system that will promote health and guarantee the 
futures of senior citizens. 
  I admire personal initiative. Colombians have the 
imagination and intelligence to assess and overcome 
difficulties. They can dream because we are capable of 
accomplishing things. That is why Colombians cannot be made 
promises based on the politics of the past. They cannot be 
thrilled by vain promises that do not tell them how these things 
will be done. I want to make a pledge to you, a serious 
commitment: We are going to strive to make work in rural areas 
profitable; to use personal and community initiatives to create 
small and intermediate companies. To achieve it, there must be 
sufficient, inexpensive, and timely loans so those who want to 
expand their businesses can do so. Any endeavor will fail when 
there is no initial capital. In my government, there will be 
loans so peasants can plant again. There will be loans so small 
and intermediate businesses can produce more and better quality 
products. There will be loans for family-owned businesses and 
for production and marketing cooperatives; there will be loans 
for new businesses. 
  I am certain that as we begin our efforts, the first thing 
we 
will produce is employment. Employment is not magic. It does 
not emerge from words but from the decision to produce more. 
You and I must realize that Colombia can grow hand in hand with 
the people, your hand in mine. We are living in a great time 
and we are not going to squander it. Let us consolidate the 
economy. Let us diversify the productive sector. Let us 
endeavor to produce quality products so we are more competitive 
and will therefore have better jobs. 
  Colombians are capable people, and together we will achieve 
our goals. I will stimulate the financial sector so we can 
offer loans to those who need them most. We must build highways 
in the villages so peasants can reach the market with their 
goods. There is nothing to be gained by producing something 
only to watch it go to waste. We must build highways, railroads, 
ports, and airports so our top-quality products can exit through 
the door of economic opening. 
  We can do it. We have to do it. An economy that is well 
administered and oriented is a wonderful instrument of the 
common good. Employment and production are two sides of the 
same coin. I will make the change you are waiting for. This is 
not merely a matter of social sensitivity but of social 
intelligence. Women and young people play a major leadership 
role in all these endeavors. Colombian women must know they will 
have equality in education and equality in the labor force not 
just in terms of opportunities but in terms of wages. We cannot 
continue to accept the fact that at the end of the 20th century, 
women are still earning lower wages. They will have equality in 
terms of loans and leadership. I am saying this clearly so 
there is no room for confusion. We cannot go on tossing 
Colombia's elderly into some attic as if they were old 
furniture. What kind of society is it that complains of poverty 
yet does not take advantage of its wealth, experience, 
accumulated knowledge, and learned abilities? Retiring should 
not be synonymous with dying but with being useful to society in 
another dimension that deserves our full support in terms of 
quantity and efficiency. 
  I have always said this thinking of you. When we are young 
we still have time to do big things. The time for making a 
major decision has come. Colombia will bear the fruits of that 
decision. Our children will be grateful for the wisdom of that 
decision. It is a decision that we must make and that holds for 
Colombia the scope of its hope, a hope I am ready to turn into a 
reality as president. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Alberto Fujimori by Guido Lombardi </F>
at the Panamericana Television studios in Lima on the "Panorama" 
program -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Lombardi] Engineer Fujimori, 
Peru is about to commemorate your fourth year in power. How do 
you feel about it? Are you tired of exercising power? 
  [Fujimori] No. Do you think I look tired? [laughs] I am 
enthusiastic. I like what I do. I am feeling increasingly 
energetic and want to resolve problems. One of the things I 
like to do best is to face problems. I do not know if this is 
explicitly stated in the book written by [name indistinct]. We 
have overcome some of the macroeconomic and terrorist problems 
and are now concentrating on social issues, like fighting 
poverty. 
  [Lombardi] Will this be your priority issue in the last year 
of your term? 
  [Fujimori] A few months ago we adopted specific measures in 
this regard. Perhaps some critics ignore this and I am sure 
they are unaware of it because they never go where these actions 
take place. There is still a lot to be done, not just next year 
but also in the years to come. 
  [Lombardi] Are you announcing that you will seek reelection? 
  [Fujimori] That is not what I meant. Presidents must seek 
the well-being of people and this entails a process. Some say I 
am campaigning but this is what presidents should do. I would 
say that all future presidents should constantly work toward 
achieving this goal, not just at cocktail parties and at the 
social level. 
  [Lombardi] Well then, I will pose my question more directly: 
Engineer Fujimori will you seek reelection? 
  [Fujimori] I believe this is the fourth time you have asked 
me the same question. [laughs] 
  [Lombardi] But we are 12 months away from the presidential 
elections... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] I believe it would be good for the 
country if these electoral issues were set aside for the time 
being. We should address electoral issues only as election time 
gets near because the country needs people to work hard. If we 
distract our attention with electoral issues, we will be unable 
to do a good job. 
  I will continue to exercise my duties as president. I have 
not yet announced my candidacy and I am still not a 
fully-fledged candidate. 
  [Lombardi] Were you referring to anyone in particular when 
you said that future presidents and eventual presidential 
candidates should be working in the field and not at the 
cocktail party level? Whom were you referring to... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] I was not thinking about anyone in 
particular... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] There is no one... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] No, but that was the traditional 
way 
the issue was handled. Was it not? 
  [Lombardi] No official candidacies have yet been announced. 
You have not announced your candidacy and no one has announced 
it either. But there are some obvious candidacies. What are 
your views on this? Whom would you like to run against next 
year? On 15 May [1995], Peru will have elected a new 
president... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] Yes, if I decide to run, that is... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] If you decide to do so... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] If I run. [laughs] It makes no 
difference to me at all. I believe... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] Do you think Perez de Cuellar would 
be a good candidate? 
  [Fujimori] Well, I would like to see him here in Peru. Only 
then we will be able to assess the situation and his 
possibilities of leading Peru. I believe protagonists must be 
at the site of events not abroad. 
  [Lombardi] The fact that he is not here does not mean we 
cannot make an assessment... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] That is perfectly fine. I also 
believe it is not good for the country to be abroad for a long 
period of time, particularly when handling national issues -- 
more specifically regarding the war on poverty. One must be on 
site to know the situation first hand. It is one thing to see 
the issues from Government House and another completely 
different issue to see the situation in (?Piquichaca) or 
(?Ancaray), which I visited today. The problems are viewed in a 
completely different light. To see how terrorism had destroyed 
these towns and the simple solutions that can be found. This 
can only be done at the site of events. 
  [Lombardi] Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont is a potential 
presidential candidate who is here in Peru and who is trying to 
resolve problems affecting Lima. Apparently you dislike him and 
even at the government level you have blocked any possible 
solutions that Belmont has come up with to resolve problems 
affecting Lima. 
  [Fujimori] The government has adopted technical measures 
seeking to decentralize power and this is being increasingly 
understood by people. 
  [Lombardi] What are your views on (?Fidel Montes) as a 
presidential candidate? 
  [Fujimori] Well, they have announced their candidacies and I 
hope many others will do the same. It is not just a question of 
these two personalities, but of other mayors as well ... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] Former mayors... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] Another candidacy was announced 
today. All this will be very lively. But we should leave all 
this activity for next year. 
  [Lombardi] Not that long because the candidacies must be 
registered by October and the campaigns must be launched ... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] Yes, but the elections will be held 
in April. Let me remind you that I started to move only by 
March. 
  [Lombardi] Let us talk about [pauses] ... but you will not 
be 
an unknown candidate like in 1990. 
  [Fujimori] No, of course not. [laughs] But you are implying 
that I am going to be a candidate. 
  [Lombardi] Let us discuss an issue which you have said will 
be your main concern this year -- social problems, an area that 
has greatly benefited from the resources obtained from 
privatizations. These huge resources were unthought of a few 
months ago. How will you spend these resources and how will 
people, the media, and Congress follow how these sources will be 
used? 
  [Fujimori] Never before this century have resources been so 
well invested. The savings that have been made by using these 
sources are tangible. I would like to give a couple of examples: 
  We saved over $100 million in an irrigation project. Imagine 
the significance of $100 million. I can build 300 schools with 
it. 
  [Lombardi] What project are you referring to? 
  [Fujimori] Chabimochic. 
  [Lombardi] But that means that the project was totally 
overvalued. 
  [Fujimori] Ah, there are works that were overvalued, others 
[word indistinct], and still others were incomplete. The 
Chimbote dock, for example, was overvalued. Fancy spending $19 
million to build a dock that is useless. 
  Look how we spent our resources. There was a long 
discussion and a campaign was launched criticizing the purchase 
of patrol cars. I read in one newspaper that this project was a 
crooked deal, that certain brands were to be preferred over 
others. That is not true. The bid was awarded to a given brand 
and we are purchasing Japanese pickup trucks to be used as 
patrol cars, with power steering, at $10,600... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] And the example set by some 
municipal districts such as [words indistinct]? 
  [Fujimori] No. Sorry, we are only talking about one 
example. I take the example of the patrol cars because I think 
the people will understand it better. We purchased ambulances 
for social projects. For this we purchased new Toyota (?Hiway) 
vans delivered to Callao Port at $10,500. We are paying $7,600 
for that type of vehicle that will be used as patrol cars. 
  Tell me what other government has paid that kind of prices. 
This is why I maintain that our resources are not ill-spent. I 
am concerned about campaigns forecasting the misuse of 
resources. Usually behind these demoralizing campaigns someone 
is trying to get the government to acquire this or that brand. 
But we do not put up with this sort of thing. I think it is 
quite clear how the government uses funds for social programs. 
For example, we have CONADE [National Development Corporation]. 
Just look at all the electrification, potable water, and sewage 
projects it has carried out in the shantytowns. As one example 
I want to mention that soon I will visit a settlement in 
Manzanares, in Huachos, which has existed for 40 years without 
potable water or sewage systems. In Cerro San Cristobal, there 
are still some people who still do not have potable water, 
sewage systems, or electricity. Therefore, there is still a lot 
for CONADE to do and I am certain that the social projects are 
being administered efficiently. 
  [Lombardi] Mr. President, to talk about the good or bad use 
of resources does not necessarily entail corruption or paying 
more for what can be purchased for less. Sometimes it refers to 
where the resources are used. You said the $100 million that 
was saved in the Chabimochic project could be invested in 
building a whole lot of schools. But is building schools all 
that is necessary to improve the quality of the education 
program in Peru or should we invest significant quantities in 
training teachers, increasing teachers' salaries, etc.? 
  [Fujimori] Now we are talking about education? 
  [Lombardi] Just as an example. Just an example of what is 
regarded as a good or bad use of resources. 
  [Fujimori] Before referring to this subject, in which I am 
very interested, I want to mention that in the social field, for 
example, this government has the cooperation of the Armed 
Forces, the Army to build neighborhood roads. Recently we 
purchased machinery worth $40 million, with a credit granted by 
Eximbank of Japan, which will be used to build neighborhood 
roads and second and third level highways. This is a special 
program. We are also building health centers as part of the 
social program. 
  In the education field, it has been said that I only think 
about education in terms of laying one brick on top of another. 
First, I want to tell those who criticize me that they are not 
acquainted with the Peruvian education system, that they are not 
aware of the real situation in Peru. Probably because, out of 
fear of the Shining Path or acts of violence, they have not 
visited shantytowns like Jose Carlos Mariategui, or [names 
indistinct], to mention some. 
  To talk about education and maintain that this or the other 
aspect must be improved is fine, but in the meantime where do 
the children and teachers go? To thatch roof huts and sit on a 
pile of bricks? This is one aspect we are correcting. We must 
improve teacher training and salaries, we must supply books, 
shoes, and even buses to the poorest sectors. The government is 
doing this. Do you know that for the first time in 20 years we 
have held a massive training program from which 45,000 teachers 
benefited. All this is being tackled in a comprehensive manner 
and this is why I believe people are wrong to criticize the 
building of schools. Wherever I go I meet crowds of children 
demanding a school, and they have every right to do so. We may 
have to build 5,000 schools in the next few years. As you may 
have seen, every Sunday there is a whole page of the newspapers 
calling for bids for the construction of 20 schools. Just take a 
look at yesterday's EXPRESO issue and you will find a call for 
bids for the construction of 20 schools, next Sunday another 20 
schools. This is one of the aspects of the social program which 
is, undoubtedly, very important. 
  [Lombardi] Regarding the social program expenditures, the 
Ministry of the Presidency is one of the sectors in charge of 
administrating the expenditures of the social program. Do you 
think someone like Minister Raul Vittor, who is accused of being 
involved with someone who is sought by Peruvian justice, should 
handle this? 
  [Fujimori] The charges have not been proven. 
  [Lombardi] No. 
  [Fujimori] If this were the case, then I should be removed 
also because there are hundreds of charges against me. Do you 
remember, during the campaign? Well... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] The relationship could be 
legitimate. 
  [Fujimori] Of course. The Ministry of the Presidency was 
created precisely so the important resources be administered by 
the Presidency of the Republic. I must say that in this regard 
I am very distrustful. I could not bear all those resources 
scattered everywhere without an effective supervision of the 
expenditures by the executive branch. Experience has shown us 
that the resources are being used in a very rational manner and 
with the best social and economic results. 
  [Lombardi] Does this mean you are satisfied with Vittor's 
performance. 
  [Fujimori] So far, I am not only satisfied with Minister 
Vittor's performance but also with all heads of the various 
sectors, that is, of the National Prisons Institute, National 
Compensation and Social Development Fund, National Housing Fund, 
the infrastructure minister, and all my ministers, whom, let me 
tell you, I call my managers because they are the managers of 
the government's policies. 
  [Lombardi] Somewhere we read that you call yourself general 
manager. Sandro Fuentes, for example, is an excellent manager, 
he did an excellent job... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] But he tendered his resignation for 
personal reasons. By the way, some believe a businessman should 
be elected for this post but I disagree because what the country 
needs is a greater collection of revenues. Therefore, we need 
someone neutral so that the amount of revenues collected may 
grow. Moreover, revenues come from the business sector. 
  [Lombardi] Would not you like Sandro Fuentes, whom you know 
is an efficient person, in another cabinet post? 
  [Fujimori] I have not even thought about this possibility. 
Probably [words indistinct]. 
  [Lombardi] President Fujimori, one extremely important issue 
-- you have always granted it particular importance -- is the 
national pacification process. During the past few days in 
Lima, obviously not with the same magnitude of the past, there 
seems to be a new terrorist outbreak. There have been a few 
detonated petards and bombs that have only damaged windows. 
Nevertheless, it is worrisome. How does the government view 
these incidents; what intelligence information on the issue do 
you have? 
  [Fujimori] This is only normal because the Shining Path, 
which is at death's door, is trying to make itself noticed with 
this type of violent actions. The situation is under control. 
We have the military front, particularly in the rural jungle 
zone and also in the urban zones keeping close track of 
terrorists. The citizenry must clearly understand that the war 
has not ended. We must not be over optimistic. The war will 
continue until 1995. There will be certain actions around 18 
May, which marks the date on which they began their attacks. 
But the important thing is the progress we have made. You have 
not asked me about the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] 
because, subconsciously, you have forgotten about them. That is 
what will happen. Gradually we will progress in this struggle 
against terrorism and the people may rest assured that we are 
acting with determination, effectively against the Shining Path. 
There is no turning back. 
  [Lombardi] We must not forget we are still at war, that the 
war has not ended. Maybe you are partially responsible for this 
lack of concern, convincing us that we will defeat the MRTA and 
the Shining Path. 
  [Fujimori] I said I was going to defeat them in 1993. We are 
already behind schedule. We are still missing two Shining Path 
leaders. A couple of weeks ago the police arrested important 
members, right? They are members of the Shining Path national 
executive council. 
  [Lombardi] By the way, some Chileans have been sentenced 
for treason to the fatherland. There is concern among 
congressmen. The other day, we talked with Chilean Congressman 
Pizarro, the president of Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
Chilean Chamber of Deputies, who asked us how Chileans can be 
sentenced for treason to the fatherland in Peru. He asked: Was 
it a mistake? 
  [Fujimori] No, that was simply the name of the charge. It 
could have been called, let us say, treason to regional 
security. It is currently being described in a bill. Those 
Chilean terrorists committed a crime which is described as 
treason to the fatherland. Now, let us not forget that Castillo 
Petruzzi and his group kidnapped and held several people hostage 
in filthy cells, and they even murdered several of them. That is 
why I -- I think this television channel is seen in Chile -- am 
here addressing all Chileans, who should thank us. Those 
outlaws are now in Peru. They are very safe, sentenced to life 
without any possibility of escape. Imagine if they were 
released in 15 or 20 years. It would be terrible. They would 
be a threat. 
  [Lombardi] You referred to the military fronts that operate 
in rural zones. Let us talk about the Huallaga region. What 
were the objectives of Operation Scorpion Three. 
  [Fujimori] Two objectives. One was to eliminate, eradicate, 
any final Shining Path strongholds that may exist in the 
Huallaga region. At the same time, the Army is working in the 
(hills) in the Ene Valley where the Shining Path has been 
entrenched since 1984 and where they captured Ashaninka Indians. 
The intention is to first eradicate them and then to send the 
settlers and the natives back home. 
  [Lombardi] Have these objectives been met? How long will it 
take? 
  [Fujimori] Near the Bolson Cuchara Valley -- by the way it 
is 
the place where the [words indistinct] (escaped) -- but we will 
find him for sure. I hope that within a month we will have a 
[word indistinct]. Many deserters are surrendering [word 
indistinct] from the war. Within a month, the area will be 
clean. But this does not mean totally clean. This is where the 
Shining Path members who killed more than 50 people in Matucana 
came from. 
  [Lombardi] It was like a Shining Path shelter... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] It was a fortress. 
  [Lombardi] You said war is war. Evidently excesses are 
committed during a war, and innocent people may die. Charges of 
human rights violations in the Huallaga region have been raised. 
Do you think excesses could have taken place? Are you willing 
to investigate? Are the Armed Forces willing to punish those 
who committed excesses? 
  [Fujimori] I do not rule out that some mistakes could have 
happened. I do not rule that out. That should be thoroughly 
investigated. Responsibilities must be determined, but ... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] Mistakes like these affect local 
victims and national security. They affect us at the 
international level. An investigation should be carried out and 
solved by someone trustworthy and credible. 
  [Fujimori] There are several organizations with jurisdiction 
in this subject. They should be international organizations. 
For example, I can mention the congressional human rights 
organization, the attorney general's office, and any other 
organization that wants to investigate the subject. But let us 
not repeat mistakes of the past. The Shining Path committed 
some crimes which were blamed on the Army and the police. We 
have had several of those cases. We are very strict in this. 
We cannot fold our arms and ... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] [question indistinct] 
  [Fujimori] We agree that the civilian population must be 
respected. There has been a radical change in the strategy of 
the antiterrorist struggle because the instructions given to the 
police and the Armed Forces is to first provide support for the 
population so that ... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] Are those instructions still in 
force? 
  [Fujimori] Yes, those instructions are still valid. 
  [Lombardi] I have unconfirmed information that the military 
troops in the Huallaga region are 17 or 18 year-old recruits? 
There are not many, I heard there is a 300-strong battalion. 
Why was this task assigned to such young men who lack 
experience and may get jittery, and not to troops with 
experience in the antisubversive struggle? 
  [Fujimori] We do not have professional troops. Our troops 
are young men who, according to the law, start their mandatory 
military service at the age of 18. There are also some 
volunteers who are not minors. They are trained and commanded 
by capable officers. I must clarify something: It is very easy 
to be sitting on the sofa at home, watching television while our 
military men and soldiers are in the jungle at the risk of being 
the target of a bazooka or of stepping on a mine. We must 
clearly recognize the effort being carried out by our national 
police and Armed Forces. To whom do we owe the success of the 
economic program, peace, and a social program? We owe it to 
them, to the peasant self defense patrols, and to the people who 
fought terrorism, sacrificing their lives. How many of our Armed 
Forces are now handicapped? 
  When people talk to me about human rights I tell them I 
defend the human rights -- you can see for yourself in our 
prisons, which are the best in Latin America -- of those who 
defend the human rights of 22 million Peruvians. Do you recall 
any article published by international human rights organization 
on atrocities committed by the Shining Path and the MRTA? I 
have not read any. That is why I began an international 
campaign in 1992 to make the human rights of our people be known. 
  [Lombardi] Apparently your campaign has been successful 
because Amnesty International has begun to ... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] Ah yes, it began to report on it as 
of May or June 1992. 
  [Lombardi] (Pierre Same), the secretary general of Amnesty 
International has come to Peru. The justice minister has said 
you will not receive him. Why not? Given that Amnesty 
International has reported on human rights violations committed 
by insurrectional groups? 
  [Fujimori] Groups are free to carry out the investigation 
they want. We have total freedom in this country. Even 
International Red Cross inspectors can go into our prisons. 
  [Lombardi] But the Red Cross has not been allowed to enter 
in 
the Huallaga Region. 
  [Fujimori] I believe that impasse has been overcome. There 
is total freedom to carry out investigations. I wonder if, for 
example in other countries, the president receives 
representatives of human rights organizations? Does President 
Clinton receive them?. I do not think so. We are a sovereign 
country in this aspect. But the country is open to any 
investigation. Our government is defending the people's human 
rights. 
  [Lombardi] President Fujimori, to ensure that the Armed 
Forces effort in defeating subversion is totally and unanimously 
recognized, other facts should take place. For example, the 
arrest of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, also known as Vaticano. 
It was said that some Armed Forces officers stationed in 
trafficking zones are linked with traffickers. Names were 
given. What investigations are being carried out? How many 
officers have been arrested? Do you think that given the great 
power of drug trafficking, some personnel, not the whole 
institution -- no one is accusing the Armed Forces or the 
Peruvian Army -- but some officers could have been tempted by 
the traffickers? 
  [Fujimori] Of course, that is human. Some have been tempted. 
That is why the Military Supreme Court has sentenced several 
officers for the crime of drug trafficking. These cases have 
taken place. A few were tried in civilian courts. Demetrio 
Chavez Penaherrera was charged for two crimes: Terrorism and 
trafficking. If a civilian court tried him for drug trafficking, 
where would he be right now? We would be saying that he is in 
such and such place, or that he escaped from prison, or that he 
is still being tried and that there is a risk that he may 
escape. Now he can be tried and asked which military officers 
are involved. Why can we ask him that? Because he is in a safe 
prison, serving a 25 or 30 year sentence. [words indistinct] 
had he been tried by a civilian court, I doubt he would still be 
in our hands. 
  [Lombardi] Just like the case of Manrique. 
  Before discussing the letter of intent with the IMF, and 
because people say we journalists are very sensitive about our 
rights, I would like to ask you to comment on reports that you 
allegedly forced a member of the international press, who 
accompanied you on a trip to Puno, to erase a video tape 
containing a recording of your visit to the (?Llamamallo) jail. 
What happened in Puno? 
  [Fujimori] That report is correct because the recording 
contained a diatribe by a female Shining Path member. We will 
not allow the Shining Path to make rallying speeches. That was 
feasible before when the media were compelled to broadcast video 
and audio tapes containing calls of the so-called armed struggle. 
  The government will not lose such an important front as is 
the psychological war. I believe Peru has the right to adopt 
all the strategies it sees fit in this war. Aside from all 
these issues, I believe that the achievement of peace is above 
everything less... 
  [Lomabardi, interrupting] Mr. President... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] As for freedom of the press, I 
respect it and uphold complete freedom of speech. 
  [Lombardi] Well, here you are to exercise that same right. 
  [Fujimori] [words indistinct] 
  [Lombardi] This past week, the government published a letter 
of intent with the IMF and a few days later the annexes. 
  [Fujimori] Correct. 
  [Lombardi] Some say this is merely protocol because the 
content of the letter includes details of an extensive 
negotiating process that lasted several months which cannot be 
altered no matter what criticisms and opinions may be expressed 
in the next few days. This is one interpretation of the issue, 
the other interpretation is even more bold. 
  Some allege you do not want to sign the letter of intent, 
that you want to gain time, and that you will use these opinions 
to justify your not signing it. They allege you do not want to 
sign it because it restricts the use of funds in social projects 
to 650 million [currency not specified] and that you want to 
spend more than that in the election year. What is the truth 
behind the publication of this letter? Why was the letter of 
intent published? 
  [Fujimori] The publication of the letter of intent before 
its 
signing is in keeping with what was ordered by the Central 
Reserve Bank and the economy minister. I want to note the 
importance of such a publication. These letters of intent are 
normally drafted secretly and kept under cover because of 
certain fears. 
  First, the guidelines of the economic program and its 
objectives are clearly specified. Let us suppose we are unable 
to amend it, but if we are a truly sovereign state we can do so 
by specifying which clauses we want to amend [word indistinct]. 
  I have to admit that although neither Central Reserve Bank 
Chairman German Suarez or Economy Minister Jorge Camet are 
members of the military, I have quote, ordered, unquote, 
[chuckles] them not to sign the letter of intent until a 
consensus is achieved. 
  We were about to sign it sometime ago, but I was 
dissatisfied 
with some terms particularly regarding the use in social 
programs of resources realized from privatizations. But we have 
to sign this letter of intent sometime in the future. It will 
not be beneficial for Peru to refuse to sign. Peru has to sign 
it... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] But IPAE [expansion unknown] 
Chairman [name indistinct] has said Peru should not sign. 
  [Fujimori] I am surprised that a businessman should adopt 
such a stance. Perhaps he has ties with the previous 
administration... 
  [Lombardi interrupting] No, he is a young man and [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Fujimori] Anyway, if Peru signs the letter of intent, we 
will have a technical endorsement from the highest international 
financial institution. With the letter of intent approved by 
the IMF we will have the IMF's support. This would allow us to 
request concessions and pardons from the Paris Club or request 
say $100 million from the World Bank for social stability 
programs. It is a fundamental endorsement. 
  Now, even [pauses] after 5 April, everyone unanimously 
supported the reinsertion of Peru. Do you remember? 
  [Lombardi] Absolutely. 
  [Fujimori] We will achieve our reinsertion by signing the 
letter of intent... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] But two years after Peru's 
reinsertion, Peruvians have started to wonder. It is true the 
agreements achieved with the IMF have allowed us to pay and to 
receive funds. 
  President Fujimori, when you assumed power in 1990 you 
inherited a foreign debt totalling $19 billion. Today, after 
paying part of it through the great effort of all Peruvians, 
this debt has risen to $24 billion -- and this is without having 
contracted any new debts because we basically paid interest 
rates. In view of this, does it make sense to continue paying? 
  [Fujimori] There will come a point beyond which we will not 
make such large disbursements. A good part of this hike in the 
foreign debt was caused by interest rates contracted by previous 
administrations. This is why we are paying so much interest. 
Suppose the debt totals $20 billion. If we add only 10 
percent, we will be throwing away $2 billion. 
  We must strive to reduce debt servicing. This is why we need 
a letter of intent. This must be followed by a reduction in the 
servicing of the foreign debt, and a condoning of our debt with 
international banks. All this entails a process. Let us 
discuss the Brady Plan. 
  Friends, the Brady Plan consists of the following: Peru owes 
$6 billion to international banks, this in addition to interest. 
Through the Brady Plan, Peru can refinance... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] But at lower interest rates... 
  [Fujimori, continues] ... but condoning an important chunk 
of 
the debt. Suppose that after negotiations we are able to 
condone 50 percent of our debt, that is, instead of a $6 
billion-debt we will have a $3 billion-debt. We pay a part of 
the remaining $3 billion and the rest is paid over 30 years. 
This is a way of reducing the servicing of the debt. 
  [Lombardi] Mr. President, experts are concerned about some 
aspects of the letter of intent while the majority are concerned 
about other issues. For example, people say that tax revenues 
should be 12.1 percent and that if this is not achieved 
corrective measures will be adopted. I get goose pimples 
because this is tantamount to more taxes. 
  [Fujimori] Well, it is those who pay taxes who should worry. 
  [Lombardi] Do you pay taxes? 
  [Fujimori] Yes I do and I believe the majority of Peruvians, 
at least those with an income, pay taxes. A 12.1 percent tax 
revenue is low. It is low because we should not think only from 
the point of view of those who pay taxes but in terms of those 
who benefit from these revenues. If we increase tax revenues -- 
and this is not necessarily achieved by creating more taxes or 
by increasing tax rates -- it means the government will have 
more resources to build schools, roads, running water systems, 
sewage systems, and energy systems. 
  This is why the government seeks to achieve a tax revenue 
totalling 12.1 percent of the GDP. Neither you nor businessmen, 
however, should worry, Mr. Lombardi, because you will not pay 
more taxes. Right now tax revenues total 12.7 percent of the 
GDP... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] But that is... 
  [Fujimori continues]... which means the current tax revenue 
is higher... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] So, we have already achieved the 
objective... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] Of course. 
  [Lombardi] This is confusing. For example, there is talk of 
an increase in the GDP of 4.5 percent. But all economic 
indicators -- and even the economy minister has confirmed this 
-- show that the economic growth in 1994 is estimated at about 7 
percent, if not more. What is the reasoning behind these low 
figures? 
  [Fujimori] The letter of intent was drafted a few months 
back 
and only one of its articles, the one pertaining to the use of 
resources obtained from privatizations, was negotiated. Let me 
remind you that in the beginning we were talking about $250 
million plus $200 million, and now we are talking about $250 
million and up to $876 million. There is, therefore, a little 
imbalance but we are achieving the macroeconomic goals. In 
other words, we will not create more taxes because of this 
clause. In view of the tax reform we now have only four taxes: 
income tax, tariffs, General Sales Tax and consumer tax. We 
have rationalized taxes. 
  [Lombardi] Just one final thing on the letter of intent. It 
is very surprising that a president from an agricultural 
background -- a farmer, a former Agrarian University rector -- 
has left aside the agricultural issue. For example, there have 
been reports that the agriculture surtax will be repealed in the 
next few years and the agriculture reactivation program was left 
aside. What do you have to say to all this? 
  [Fujimori] We have defended the agriculture surtax in 
arduous 
negotiations with the Inter-American Development Bank and we 
have publicly stated that we rejected this precondition. There 
will be a surtax until 1976 ... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] You mean 1996. 
  [Fujimori] I mean 1996 [chuckles]. In 1997, the new 
government will have to renegotiate this but it will depend on 
international agriculture prices. Agriculture has been 
protected as never before. There are no subsidies... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting]...direct subsidies... 
  [Fujimori, continues] ...but the agriculture policy seeks to 
maintain certain prices within a given bracket, with a flexible 
surtax, so that if there is a sharp drop in international prices 
of, let us say, rice prices, we will increase the surtax. In 
view of this, rice farmers -- except for seasonal reasons -- are 
guaranteed a minimum profit. 
  [Lombardi] Will you fulfill the privatizations timetable in 
the year that is left of your administration? There have been 
successes, some failures, and it has faded out at times, but do 
you believe you will complete the privatization process by July 
1995? 
  [Fujimori] I refuse to assess it in terms of success or 
failure. There have been more successes than anything else. If 
we make a final balance we can say that the privatization 
process has been successful... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] Absolutely, on balance it has been 
successful. I did not mean failures, I meant temporary 
frustrations. (?I was not generalizing.) What happened with 
Centromin Peru [Central Peru Mining Enterprise] was not a 
failure, more a frustration. 
  [Fujimori] No. Centromin Peru was not undervalued as people 
alleged, it was just that, of the 40 or 50 bidders, no one dared 
to bid the $280 million plus the $60 million needed to cover the 
debt. It was not that undervalued. 
  But on balance, the privatization process has been 
successful. Four years after its implementation, I believe I am 
entitled to say that we had a good [word indistinct], a good 
privatization timetable within the framework of the integral 
development program because we intensified the privatization 
process after achieving domestic stability, otherwise we could 
have auctioned them... 
  [Lombardi, interrupting] Of course... 
  [Fujimori continues]... therefore, we will continue at the 
same pace but always looking for the best prices. Look at the 
$68 million we got for (?CementoYura); look at National 
Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru. By the way I cannot 
imagine what it must be like to receive $2 billion. [chuckles] 
  [Lombardi] There are those who will not believe it until 
they 
see the check. 
  [Fujimori] Ah well, I am one of them because I stand by St. 
Thomas saying: Seeing is believing. 
  [Lombardi] We will have to wait until 17 May to verify this. 
  [Fujimori] But I trust the Spanish Telephone Company, it is 
a 
very serious company. 
  [Lombardi] Former President Alan Garcia's father has just 
passed away. Had it been up to you, would you have authorized 
former President Garcia to attend his father's funeral and 
offered him guarantees that he would not be arrested? 
  [Fujimori] Yes. Instructions were given that if the former 
president arrived, no measures were to be adopted against him. 
This I believe went a little against the trial proceedings. 
  [Lombardi] President Fujimori, thank you very much for your 
willingness to hold such a long interview on the Panorama 
program tonight. We are all impatiently waiting for 17 May at 
noon, when the Spanish Telephone Company will deposit a 
$2-billion check. Thank you very much. 
  [Fujimori] Thank you very much and I know this will be a new 
milestone in the history of Peru's development. Thank you and 
good night.

  [Text] Barranca, 10 May -- President Alberto Fujimori said 
here that the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement [MRTA] has been 
practically liquidated. This statement follows the recent 
capture of high-ranking leaders of this terrorist organization. 
  Regarding his possible reelection as president, Fujimori 
said 
he had not yet thought about the possibility, but would think 
the matter over carefully if the people asked him to run again. 
  The president arrived in this city at around 1500, 
accompanied by Transport Minister Dante Cordova Blanco, 
Inter-American Development Bank representative Rosa Watson, the 
South Korean ambassador, and a group of South Korean 
legislators. His arrival occurred after a three-hour delay in 
Chancay. The helicopter transporting him and his entourage had 
to land at a local stadium in this town due to bad weather in 
the area. 
  In Barranca, Fujimori and his entourage were received by 
Provincial Mayors Paulino Leon Soto and Carlos Mesa, General 
Pedro Moreano, head of the 8th Military Region Army Security 
Department, and other high-ranking provincial authorities. 
  After the protocol greetings, President Fujimori inaugurated 
a 50 km long stretch of the North Panamerican Highway linking 
Pativilca and Huacho. Here, the president made a short speech 
stressing that the MRTA had been practically liquidated 
following the hard blows against the movement's national 
leadership. 
  The president did not give details, but added that in the 
past few days the forces of order had captured important leaders 
of this terrorist organization. He did not mention the place or 
number of individuals captured. Fujimori also said the Shining 
Path will be eliminated before 1995, the year of the end of his 
mandate. 
  Answering a group of local inhabitants who asked him to run 
for president in the upcoming elections, Fujimori said he had 
not yet thought about the possibility, "but if the people ask me 
to run I will study the possibility."

  [Text] Quito, 17 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Ecuadoran peasants 
and Indians took over a provincial cathedral and blocked roads 
to protest an agricultural structuring bill presented to the 
parliament by President Sixto Duran-Ballen. The Confederation of 
Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), which declared a 
48-hour strike beginning on 18 May, also reject the governmental 
plan, which must be studied by the (unicameral) Congress this 
week. 
  Local authorities confirmed a large number of protesters 
peacefully occupied the Ibarra Cathedral this morning in the 
capital of Imbabura Province, 75 km from Quito. The peasants and 
Indians presented a manifesto asking the church to mediate to 
ensure the government withdraws its agrarian restructuring plan. 
They reported the government is trying to implement a 
"privatization wave" and "to eliminate the right to own land, 
the communal properties of the Indian peoples, and the agrarian 
reform law." 
  In this document, the protesters demanded the deputies 
reject 
the governmental project, because it is "unconstitutional and 
antidemocratic and represents the interests of a small group of 
large landowners." 
  Meanwhile, members of the Imbabura Indian and Peasant 
Federation and other similar organizations blocked the roads in 
the northern part of the country. The police maintained they 
controlled the protests without any incidents. The Conaie 
followed through on its call to hold a number of protests on 18 
and 19 May. The Indian and peasant organizations that oppose the 
agrarian project even warned they would promote an "uprising" 
that could halt the country. Obstructing the transportation of 
products from the countryside to the cities, blocking roads, and 
staging nationwide street protests are among the first actions 
of the "preventive" event organized by Conaie. The protests 
include a gathering in front of the National Congress in Quito. 
  The main Ecuadoran workers union, the United Workers Front 
(FUT), the Teachers National Union, and student and public 
employees organizations today announced they will support the 
Indian and peasant uprising. 
  The National Congress, which must issue a ruling at the 
latest on 19 May, must analyze the controversial agrarian 
project. Meanwhile, the Duran-Ballen administration stated it 
will go on with the modernization project and warned it will 
take the necessary steps to maintain peace and order in the 
country.

  [Text] Brasilia -- On 17 May, Finance Minister Rubens 
Ricupero authorized Osiris Lopes Filho, head of the Federal 
Revenue Secretariat [SRF], to implement an administrative 
restructuring of the SRF in stages. The SRF now will have an 
intelligence service charged with fighting tax evasion. 
Ricupero's decision represents a victory for Lopes Filho in his 
dispute with Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis 
Carvalho, who has opposed the creation of new positions of trust. 
  During the first stage, 580 new positions will be created at 
a cost of 300,000 Real Value Units (URV's) monthly to fill four 
new coordinating offices. The original SRF proposal envisioned 
the creation of 2,000 positions at a cost of 1.2 million URV's 
monthly. 
  The following coordinating offices will be created: Fiscal 
Intelligence, which will be charged with fighting tax evasion; 
Customs Assessment, which will identify cases of undercharging 
of export products or overcharging of import items; 
Classification and Nomenclature, which will monitor the 
technological evolution of products; and Auditing and 
Correction, which will oversee internal operations. 
  Furthermore, 18 special offices will be charged with 
appraising the taxable wealth of taxpayers in court hearings, in 
addition to their regular assessment duties. The SRF signed an 
$80 million contract with the Inter-American Development Bank to 
create automated regional centers to become self-sufficient in 
data processing operations. 
  Lopes Filho welcomed Ricupero's decision, which he 
characterized as "recognition of the significant role played by 
the SRF." The project that appears to be most exciting for him 
is the creation of the intelligence service. He said: The SRF 
now will have instruments to fight tax evasion crimes.

  [Text] The upcoming elections and the possibility that 
Workers Party presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva 
may win them have made the government fall back from its initial 
idea to allow the free conversion of reals for dollars, using 
its $37 billion exchange reserves for this. The idea was, like 
in the case of Argentina, to allow the freedom to exchange one 
real for $1 as of 1 July. This would give credibility to the new 
currency given that the government would guarantee the exchange 
with its reserves. That was the idea conceived by the economic 
team last September when it began preparing the Real Plan, an 
idea that prevailed until a few months ago. 
  Now, during the first months of the year, the elections have 
turned up as a real factor in the political scene, as well as 
all the variables and alternatives that could take place in case 
the government insisted on its idea of free conversion. Thus, 
the economic team began to think about the measure's 
consequences and then retracted it. The greatest difficulty was 
the certainty that the elections would interrupt the economic 
plan's continuity and a new administration might change its 
guidelines or simply revoke the plan, as indicated during the 
election campaign. 
  Lula's growing popularity has reinforced the economic team's 
decision to retreat from its initial idea. During his campaign, 
Lula will certainly try to mark a difference with Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso in the field in which the Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party candidate has the greatest advantage -- the 
economic plan -- by creating an atmosphere of uncertainty 
regarding its future. What is more, the most important aspect is 
that the economic agents believe that Lula may somehow freeze 
the domestic debt, a fear that will be reinforced if, in keeping 
with its prevailing trend, the PT's campaign propaganda is to 
promise to take action against the fast and profitable 
enrichment of banks in the past few years. If the government 
decided to allow free conversion of reals for dollars, it would 
seriously run the risk of seeing its exchange reserves diminish 
quickly as people rushed for dollars in order to avoid having 
their financial assets frozen [confisco]. The consequence of 
such an action would be an exchange crisis worse than that which 
took place at the end of the Cruzado Plan when Brazil had to 
declare a moratorium on its debt.

<F P=106> [Article by Nelson Luiz de Oliveira in Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] A government led by Luis Inacio Lula da Silva would 
no longer allow the monthly entry of nearly $1 billion into the 
country. This is the average foreign capital brought into the 
country by investors for speculative operations, namely in stock 
markets. On 17 May in remarks to Radio CBN, Lula said that if 
elected, he would allow only foreign capital that is intended 
for creating jobs. After lunching with foreign executives in Sao 
Paulo, Lula said: "It will be up to the Central Bank [BC] to 
define which investment is speculative." 
  According to BC figures, $19.7 billion was brought into the 
country from 1990 to 1993 for purchasing stocks and for 
investments in the financial market. The monthly average of 
foreign capital brought into the country for this purpose in 
1993 stood at $1.2 billion. A total of $3.9 billion was brought 
in during the first two months of 1994. 
  In August, then-Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 
who is now a presidential candidate, took measures to stem the 
inflow of foreign capital, which already was exerting pressure 
on the issuance of Brazilian currency. Institutional investors 
(pension funds, insurance companies, and others) were channeling 
large resources not only into stock markets but also into fixed 
income investments. The latter were then excluded from stock 
market operations and subjected to an Financial Operations Tax 
surcharge. 
  Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) sources conveyed 
their surprise over Lula's remarks. Stock markets would be 
strongly affected by restrictive measures. They believe it will 
be difficult to define which operations by institutional foreign 
investors are speculative. Normally, the amount of capital that 
leaves the country monthly after obtaining profits accounts for 
40 percent of the incoming capital. 
  CVM sources fear that Lula would allow only direct 
investments. These investments totaled $3.4 billion from 1990 to 
1993 and $481 million during the first two months of 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>
  [Text] Workers Party [PT] presidential candidate Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva on 17 May announced that the PT has decided 
to promote a social pact, which would be called "social accord," 
to fight inflation. Lula made the disclosure to 52 executives 
from large foreign groups during a luncheon in Sao Paulo. He 
said: "Inflation in Brazil is not fueled by demand; rather, it 
is a political problem. The way to reduce it gradually, 
effectively, and lastingly is through a social pact among 
workers, business people, and the government. Our government 
will be based on such an agreement because inflation will 
decline only when this agreement is achieved." The idea of a 
pact is not new. It was tried under the government of Jose 
Sarney by then-Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto, but it was not 
endorsed by either the PT or the Sole Workers Center, the trade 
union closest to the PT. 
  As an example of the type of agreement he wants, Lula cited 
the pact concluded two years ago by business people, workers, 
and government in the car industry that resulted in tax cuts for 
the industry and job security for workers. After noting that the 
eight administrations that have ruled the country since 1985 
have not succeeded in curbing inflation, but rather provoked 
losses to workers, Lula said: "We have to start by bringing 
inflation under social control." He added that it also will 
become necessary "to introduce changes" to oligopolies and the 
financial system, to guarantee investment in productive 
activities, and to fight corruption in state-owned banks so they 
will no longer be used as "backup coffers" and that "domestic 
debt can be rescheduled so the state can count on funds for 
investments." 
  Lula went as far as responding to questions by business 
people about how a socialist party plans to attract foreign 
capital. He said: "Capital has neither fatherland nor ideology. 
No businessman who has invested in China has questioned the 
Chinese Government about the Tiananmen Square massacre." Lula 
stated that investors would respond positively if his government 
assured them that they would obtain profits. He added that, to 
this end, it will suffice to "slightly increase" the purchasing 
power of all Brazilians. He said: "If we achieve this, the 
consumer market will be such that you will be interested in 
investing here." 
  The business people also expressed concern about the closed 
nature of the Brazilian economy and about the fact that the PT 
opposes the privatization of state-owned companies. Making it 
clear that he is not in favor of opening up the economy, Lula 
said: "Open borders sound good in speeches, but in practice 
every country has mechanisms to defend its market and products." 
He announced that the PT will maintain a state monopoly over 
petroleum and telecommunications but will promote concessions to 
the private sector in other areas. Showing that he is against 
privatization, Lula said: "But instead of trying to buy the 
existing state-owned companies, why do you not try to build 
railroad tracks and roads and many other much-needed projects in 
Brazil"? 
  The business people come from various countries, the United 
States, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Japan, Korea, and 
Australia, among others, and represent large groups such as IBM, 
Mitsubishi Bank, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, AT&amp;T, and 
Eastman Kodak, among others. They are attending a master's 
degree program of the Massachuset Institute of Technology, which 
promoted similar visits to Chile and Argentina, where they met 
President Carlos Menem, and Mexico. In Brazil, they also are 
scheduled to meet economists Persio Arida and Andre Lara Resende 
to learn about the economic proposal of Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party's presidential 
candidate.

<F P=106> [Article by Vanda Celia: "Government Spends $4 Billion </F>
Illegally"] 
  [Text] President Itamar Franco and 16 ministers of state 
spent a total of $3.9 trillion cruzeiros -- the equivalent of 
approximately $4 billion -- illegally in January, February, and 
March of this year. The Congressional Joint Commission on the 
Budget, working through its technical staff, is conducting a 
study of the irregular expenditures that the government is 
making with no legal basis whatever. 
  Federal Deputy Paulo Bernardo (PT [Workers Party], Parana), 
who made the initial calculations regarding those expenditures, 
will address the Chamber of Deputies today to denounce Itamar 
and the ministers for exceeding the appropriations in the 
General Budget of the Union. The deputy also intends to send an 
official letter requesting explanations by the ministers and 
President Itamar Franco. 
  The president and the ministers responsible for irregular 
budget spending can be punished for crimes of responsibility. 
Such crimes are covered by the Constitution and by two other 
laws dealing with public administration. But Deputy Bernardo 
does not believe that Congress has the political will to demand 
enforcement of the law. "The budget issue is a policing issue 
because the administration thinks the legislative branch is `the 
house of Mother Joan' [meaning not known]," he said. 
  According to the law -- Provisional Measure No. 396 -- the 
government is to spend one-twelfth of the budget appropriations. 
Excepted from that rule are budgeted expenditures for personnel, 
social security contributions, welfare benefits, debt service, 
and scholarships, teaching manuals, and benefits for government 
employees, including medical and dental care, as well as 
expenditures financed by funds originating in external credit 
operations and their respective counterpart funds. Any other 
expenditures, excluding subprojects and subactivities that were 
not already under way in 1993, must not exceed one-twelfth of 
the amount provided in the budget.

<H5>  Even Planalto Palace Ignores Law </H5>
  The current budget law, for which President Itamar Franco is 
responsible, is being ignored even by Planalto Palace, according 
to the study conducted by the Federal Integrated Financial 
Management System (Siafi). In addition to what was allowed, the 
Office of the President of the Republic spent $549 million 
cruzeiros on the Armed Forces General Staff and the Brazilian 
Communication Company. 
  "The government issued a provisional measure to regulate 
those expenditures, but even it is not capable of obeying that 
measure," Deputy Bernardo complained. The congressman feels that 
President Itamar Franco has an obligation to see to it that the 
ministers explain themselves to the National Congress. 
  Responding to a request from another PT deputy, Jose Paulo 
Pires (Minas Gerais), the Budget Commission's technical staff is 
also investigating the reasons why the administration 
overstepped the amounts established in the provisional measure 
on the budget. "We still do not know how much was spent in 
total, but we are asking the ministries to supply us with data 
on that subject," said the chief of the Budget and Financial 
Oversight Staff, Francisco de Paulo Schettini. Some ministries 
are reporting that they did not overspend, but spent only what 
was appropriated -- although that explanation is not being 
accepted in Congress -- on the grounds that "appropriation" 
means that public money has already been committed, according to 
the Budget Commission.

<F P=106> [Article: "Now There Is a Crusade in Defense of the Real"] </F>
  [Text] Ricupero is a fervent Catholic but likes a 
good fight. In his opinion, the desire to avoid conflict serves 
only to delay change. 
  So the man is Rubens Ricupero, a practicing Catholic whom 
many Brazilians first got to know under unusual circumstances: a 
foot-washing ceremony during Holy Week. His first statement upon 
being named minister of finance brought good news. "Spending is 
banned," he said, repeating the famous phrase by former 
President Tancredo Neves. Chances seem good that the ban is 
genuine. "As an admirer of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Ricupero will 
find it very difficult to lie," says Deputy Delfim Netto. "Lying 
is not a sin in Marxism, but to Saint Thomas it is a capital 
offense." 
  Hours before being sworn in in the vast reception hall on 
the 
third floor of Planalto Palace, Ricupero told Nely Caixeta, 
EXAME's editor in Brasilia, what was going through his head. 
Here is some of what he said: 
  The Fernando Henrique Cardoso-2 Plan: "It is the first plan 
in Brazilian history to be concerned with ensuring smooth 
operations during the first year of the following 
administration. We want to have everything solved by 1995, but 
without the structural reforms now pending, it will be difficult 
to ensure the success of the plan." 
  Inflation: "Without stability and balance in the public 
accounts, there is no salvation. Why is it that in Latin 
America, we are the only ones who have not managed to eliminate 
inflation? Is it because we have a kind of genetic flaw or is it 
because our institutions and, basically, the Constitution render 
us incapable of making decisions?" 
  Privatization: "This is an issue we cannot avoid. The fact 
is 
that in coming years, the government-owned firms are going to 
require very big investments. But the government has no way of 
investing because it stopped saving a long time ago." 
  Wages: "The idea of a wage trigger makes no sense whatever 
because it means betting that the plan will fail. Look at those 
proposals for raising the minimum wage to $100. Who is going to 
pay the salaries for the municipality of Sao Raimundo Nonato in 
southern Piaui? Deputy Paulo Paim?" 
  Elections: "It is in the interest of all the candidates that 
the stabilization program be successful. Anyone gambling on the 
idea that the worse things are the better is going to inherit a 
probably ungovernable country. It will be a Pyrrhic victory." 
  Employment: "First of all, it is necessary to eliminate 
inflation, because employment is the result of investment. We 
also must reduce the costs imposed by legislation and create 
incentives to generate well-paid jobs." 
  "Personal crusade": It is ideas like those that have made 
Ricupero's appointment a welcome one. "I have confidence in the 
minister, and I hope he will be able to implement the economic 
plan," says Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the 
Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries. "He is a serious man 
and a competent politician." For his part, Ricupero claims that 
his intention is to continue with the plan, work with the team 
set up by Fernando Henrique, and combat inflation. "The plan 
will work if every citizen and every member of the 
administration views it as a personal crusade," he says. 
  The minister's objective is to clear the path as soon as 
possible for the adoption and consolidation of the real. Issues 
such as privatization, for example, will probably not receive 
his immediate attention, although Ricupero agrees that the 
government-owned firms need to change hands. While the economic 
team holds internal debates on the best time to introduce the 
new currency and the mechanisms it will adopt for stabilization 
and conversion, Ricupero is preparing to negotiate with the 
National Congress. On the immediate agenda is approval of this 
year's budget and of the provisional measure creating the real. 
The minister also wants to breathe new life into constitutional 
reform, which is threatening, as it blunders from one obstacle 
to the next, to turn into one of the biggest fiascoes in the 
history of the legislative branch. By the beginning of January, 
when he relinquishes his post to the minister appointed by the 
next administration, Ricupero hopes to leave office with the new 
currency consolidated, the budget coordinated, and inflation 
down. 
  Replacing a minister like Fernando Henrique will not be an 
easy task for this descendant of Italian immigrants who was born 
in Bras, Sao Paulo, and likes to listen to chamber music by 
Mahler or Brahms. After all, his predecessor was able to leave 
office to the sound of applause even though the figures 
reflecting his time in office were not favorable. The country 
was growing by 4.5 percent per year when Fernando Henrique took 
over the ministry, but has now slowed to 2.5 percent per year. 
During that same period, annual inflation jumped from 2,700 
percent to 7,200 percent. "If I, Delfim, or Simonsen had gotten 
the country into that situation, we most certainly would have 
been flayed on the public square," says Deputy and former 
Minister Roberto Campos. Delfim Netto agrees, saying: "What is 
most incredible is that the National Confederation of Industry 
and Brazilian Federation of Banks approve." 
  Affable, a good storyteller, and regarded as the best 
official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he impresses his 
listeners with his knowledge of contemporary Brazilian and 
foreign problems, especially those in the area of international 
trade. He has served abroad for a total of 20 years. Like 
Fernando Henrique, Ricupero possesses a solid humanist 
background. In Brasilia, where he lives in one of the two 
mansions still owned by the government on the Peninsula of 
Ministers on South Lake, he follows the custom of another former 
minister of finance, Marcilio Marques Moreira. On Sunday 
mornings, he attends the mass celebrated at the Sao Bento 
Monastery. Alongside his wife Marisa, a teacher to whom he has 
been married for 33 years, he sings Gregorian chants in Latin. 
To obtain an interview with the minister, reporter Angela 
Coronel of EXAME's Brasilia office had to go to great lengths. 
Angela attended the Maundy Thursday Mass at the monastery at 
Ricupero's side. She then accompanied him in the procession that 
followed. Finally, an interview was arranged, and as they 
parted, Ricupero said: "This country needs God." 
  Impulsiveness: Ricupero seems to be the typical official cut 
out for government service: one of those people who try to 
acquit themselves well on any mission, whether as the country's 
representative at GATT in Geneva, as ambassador to Washington, 
or -- it is hoped -- as minister of finance. He regards as 
pointless the warnings that he will have to get along with a 
president of the republic who is given to impulsive behavior. 
"Our thinking coincides," he says, citing as proof his support 
for Itamar during the episode in connection with the conversion 
of salaries to URV's [real units of value] in the judicial 
branch. He saw nothing wrong in the president's demonstrated 
willingness to stand up to the Supreme Court justices. "There is 
something in Brazilian culture that makes people dread facing up 
to conflicts," Ricupero says. "It is that desire to avoid 
conflict which caused us to be the last country to abolish 
slavery and which is hampering changes such as those represented 
by constitutional revision." Although using different words, 
Ricupero is thereby endorsing one of the most revealing ideas 
held by the former prime minister of Great Britain, Margaret 
Thatcher, regarding the art of governing: the idea that 
consensus is the negation of leadership.

<F P=106> [Article by Francisco Alves Filho and Peter Moon: "Tropical </F>
Paradise"] 
  [Text] Russian scientists "imported" by 
the CNP [National Research Council] are testing life in Brazil 
and approving of it. Now they want to stay. 
  Scientists have no fatherland and science belongs to 
humanity. Those two maxims are taken literally by the over 40 
professors and researchers who have settled in Brazil over the 
past two years. Bankrolled by scholarships from the National 
Research Council, they are gradually adapting to the daily 
routine at Brazilian universities and losing the suspicion that 
the assignment would be no more than a brief experiment 
involving half a dozen nobodies. They are optimistic and seem to 
have forgotten the meaning of the term "goska" -- the feeling 
that we usually describe as "homesickness" or "nostalgia" -- 
when they talk about the possibility of returning to Russia. 
They want to stay in our country as long as they have the 
opportunity to work. 
  The distance separating Brazil from a country where 
professors are paid a dignified salary is the same as that 
separating Rio de Janeiro from Moscow. Be that as it may, it 
must indeed be impossible to feel nostalgic about jobs paying an 
average of $80 per month. Physicist Gregory Surdutovich, 56, was 
one of the first to arrive. He landed in Brazil in January 1992, 
impelled by the political instability and drastic cut in science 
budgets in Russia. Deteriorating conditions were causing 
salaries to plummet. Despite the shortcomings, he believes that 
Brazilian research can be improved. "The climate in the 
Brazilian scientific area today resembles that in my country 35 
years ago," says Surdutovich, who is studying the pressure of 
light on atoms at the Sao Carlos campus of the University of Sao 
Paulo (USP). Artur Elfimov, 50, the leader of a group of five 
Russian experts on plasma physics working at the Rio de Janeiro 
State University (UERJ), agrees. "If the administrators really 
give their support, this country will be able to make up for 
lost time in several areas of knowledge," he believes. 
  The researchers are a varied group. Galina Pugacheva and 
Anatoliy Gusev of the Campinas State University (Unicamp) are 
studying anomalies in the Brazilian magnetic field. Those 
phenomena cause the number of lightning flashes in our 
atmosphere to be 50 percent higher than anywhere else on the 
planet. Five other Russian scientists are assigned to work at 
the North Fluminense State University (UENF), which was opened 
on Monday 28 March. They are interested in producing synthetic 
diamonds. Under a plan by Senator Darcy Ribeiro (PDT [Democratic 
Labor Party], Rio de Janeiro), the UENF's mentor, another 15 
researchers from the former Soviet Republic [as published] will 
soon join the team. 
  In the opinion of many people, "importing" Russian 
scientists 
means saving time and money. "Training a professional at that 
level requires at least eight years of heavy investment at a 
cost that is never below $200,000," says Carlos Augusto Azevedo, 
head of the Department of Quantum Electronics at the UERJ. 
"Moreover, it will not take a long time for the work of these 
researchers to produce results," he adds. "That immigration has 
already yielded excellent results for us," says Oscar Hipolito, 
director of the Institute of Physics and Chemistry at the Sao 
Carlos campus of the USP. 
  But all that enthusiasm comes up against an obstacle: the 
law 
prohibiting the hiring of foreigners as government employees. 
That restriction, detested by the scientific community, has made 
it necessary for the Russian scientists to stay here as visiting 
professors on one- to two-year scholarships that pay from $1,000 
to $2,000 per month. Rectors and professors are attacking the 
ban on the basis of the constitutional principle of university 
autonomy. Their arguments began bearing fruit with the 
recruitment of physicist Dmitri Gitma, who was hired by the USP 
in 1992 after passing a competitive examination. 
  Gitma is an exception, however. All the other Russian 
researchers are here on scholarships, and many of them are 
experiencing an additional difficulty in order to teach in 
Brazil: inflation. Physicist Irina Potapenko of the UERJ left 
Russia two years ago. Her salary, like that of state employees, 
is adjusted according to the dollar rate every three months. "I 
live in an apartment provided by the university. But even so, 
the lag in pay means that there is only enough money for the 
upkeep fees and survival." Although her pay is eaten up by 
rising prices, she admits that she is satisfied with her work 
and is not thinking of leaving the country. When people draw her 
attention to legal and economic difficulties, she answers with 
the smile of someone who is already beginning to understand the 
Brazilian soul: "Take it easy! After all, Brazil is ours."

<F P=106> [Article: "Russian Scientists Laud Brazilian Universities"] </F>
  [Text] There is a country where the universities have 
enough advanced computers and possess well-equipped laboratories 
and it is easy to make scientific contacts abroad through 
computerized communication networks. 
  That country is Brazil, and the universities are Sao Paulo's 
three state universities: the USP [University of Sao Paulo], 
Unicamp [Campinas State University], and Unesp [Sao Paulo State 
University], according to Russian researchers who have come here 
to work. At least that is the opinion of five physicists and 
chemists who participated in last Thursday's debate on "Russian 
researchers in Brazil." The debate was sponsored by FOLHA DE SAO 
PAULO and coordinated by the retired professor of Russian 
language and literature at the University of Sao Paulo. 
  During the debate, the Russian scientists made it a point to 
emphasize that they are not exiles who fled their country. They 
were invited by Brazilian laboratories in their fields of 
interest and publish articles in international scientific 
periodicals. In addition, there were instances in which specific 
features of Brazil made the invitation more attractive to the 
scientists. 
  Petr Melnikov, for example, a visiting professor of 
inorganic 
chemistry at Unesp, came from Moscow University to continue his 
research regarding rare earths, a group of chemical elements 
with metallic properties, some of which are used in alloys. 
According to Melnikov, not only are those elements abundant in 
Brazil, but research in that field is advanced in our country. 
  While praising the laboratories and the availability of 
computers, the scientists say they would like to return to 
Russia if working conditions were good, and this in spite of 
some bitter experiences. Physicist Galina Pugachev says that 
members of her institute were forced by the Communist Party to 
harvest wheat in Kazakhstan in order not to lose their jobs. 
  Galina, who is at Unicamp studying anomalies in the magnetic 
field -- typical over Brazil -- says that although she has few 
colleagues in that area around here, she can talk to researchers 
abroad by computer. 
  "In three minutes, I receive answers from American 
colleagues 
to my questions on the computers at my university," says Galina. 
Her husband, Anatoliy Gusev, says the equipment in the nuclear 
physics lab at Unicamp is better than that at many U.S. 
universities. 
  Besides good working conditions, the participants in the 
debate drew attention to features common to academic work in 
both Brazil and Russia. The level of students is similar, as is 
freedom in the style of research -- Brazilians and Russians are 
both "looser" than Americans, who are more rigid in orientation. 
  According to physicist Gregory Surdutovich of the Sao Carlos 
campus of the USP, evaluation procedures are also similar. 
"There is not a lot of checking either there or here in 
comparison with the United States, and I like that. I got tired 
of seeing people making out deceitful productivity reports. 
Scientific activity needs to be measured by other parameters," 
he explained.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 19 May (DPA) -- Dominican President 
Joaquin Balaguer maintains a narrow lead in the 16 May 
presidential elections with 95.93 percent of the electoral 
tables counted. 
  According to Bulletin No. 19 issued by the Central Electoral 
Board (JCE) in the predawn hours, the total number of votes for 
President Balaguer and Jacinto Peynado, vice presidential 
candidate for the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), is 
1,215,513, or 42.37 percent of the counted votes. 
  Jose Francisco Pena Gomez and Fernando Alvarez Bogoert, his 
running mate of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), have 
1,187,210 votes, or 41.39 percent. 
  The difference between the two tickets is only 28,303 votes 
or less than 1 percent. Approximately 9,141 of the 9,528 
electoral tables have already been counted. Close to 3.5 million 
voters were eligible to vote. 
  Juan Bosch and Lionel Fernandez, presidential and vice 
presidential candidates of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD), 
have received 378,982 votes or 13.28 percent. Jacobo Majluta, 
presidential candidate of the Independent Revolutionary Party 
(PRI), has 65,236 votes or 2.27 percent. Priest Antonio Reinoso 
of the Independent, Unity, and Change Movement (MIUCA) has 
received 0.75 percent of the counted votes. 
  The PRD has insisted there was fraud in the elections and 
reiterated that it will challenge the results in all available 
forums, including the international community. President 
Balaguer said today he would not object to annuling the 
elections if the PRD proves its charges of fraud.

tallied. 
  According to the JCE bulletin, Balaguer has garnered 42.39 
percent of the valid votes while his opponent, Pena Gomez, has 
41.39 percent.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 19 May (NOTIMEX) -- Tonight, Jose 
Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential candidate for the Dominican 
Revolutionary Party, PRD, demanded the annulment of the 
elections held on Monday and the holding of new elections 
because of alleged election fraud. 
  Pena Gomez made the demand before a group of diplomats and 
foreign journalists, who arrived in the Dominican Republic to 
cover the election process. The Social Democratic candidate 
said the annulment of the elections is the only way to prevent 
the Dominican masses from trying to seek a solution to the 
crisis by themselves.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 19 May (EFE) -- Today, the Christian 
Social Revolutionary Party (PRSC), which proposed the reelection 
of President Joaquin Balaguer, challenged the alliance between 
the opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party [PRD] of Jose 
Francisco Pena Gomez and the Democratic Union (UD) before the 
Central Electoral Board (JCE). 
  In a document presented to the JCE, the PRSC said the 
alliance of the PRD with the UD, which is led by Fernando 
Alvarez Bogart, has a form defect because, when it was 
registered, other political parties were not informed as 
required by law. 
  Alvarez Bogart is Pena Gomez' vice presidential running mate 
and, according to the official JCE vote count, has obtained over 
51,000 votes. Alvarez Bogart was a member of the PRSC, from 
which he resigned when Balaguer, 87, announced his decision to 
run for reelection. 
  The PRSC challenged the PRD-UD alliance three months after 
the electoral campaign began and four days after the general 
elections, at which point the JCE has not yet reported the 
official provisional results of the vote count. According to 
the latest official JCE report, with 97.65 percent of the 
polling stations accounted for, Balaguer was ahead of Pena Gomez 
by only 29,590 votes, or 1.01 percent of the vote.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 19 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, official 
sources reported the Government of the Dominican Republic has 
denounced the alleged interference of journalists and 
international observers in Monday's electoral process. 
  The Foreign Ministry warned that if state security is 
violated, the authorities will try to stop these actions, which 
are considered "antidemocratic" and which have sometimes been 
carried out in a "veiled" manner and "brazenly blatant" in 
others. 
  In a communique issued this evening, the Foreign Ministry 
stated that the alleged interference of the media and 
international envoys is part of an "international conspiracy to 
unite Haiti and Santo Domingo." The document, signed by Foreign 
Minister Juan Aristides Taveras, added that the actions carried 
out during and after the electoral process by the media and 
international observers "is definitely unacceptable." 
  In an interview with the U.S. network Telemundo, Dominican 
President Joaquin Balaguer said the reports of fraud issued by 
the opposition do not alter the social peace that prevails in 
Santo Domingo after the general elections. "I believe this is 
an international plot rather than a result of Pena Gomez' 
claims; this has something to do with the Haitian problem, and 
it is the old idea of integrating the two countries," the 
87-year-old Balaguer said. 
  On Thursday [19 May], the Dominican Revolutionary Party 
(PRD) 
began to gather the necessary evidence to prove the alleged 
fraud perpetrated in Monday's general elections. Social 
Democrat Francisco Pena Gomez ordered his lawyers to prepare the 
corresponding writs and lists, with names and voters numbers, of 
party members who were not able to vote in different provinces. 
  Pena Gomez said the complete set of documents will be 
delivered to the Central Electoral Board (JCE) and "to the world 
as proof of the colossal fraud perpetrated against us."

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 19 May (DPA) -- This morning, the 
Central Electoral Board (JCE) began reviewing the figures issued 
in official bulletins on the results of Monday's elections, thus 
responding to accusations by the opposition Dominican 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), which said the figures are fraudulent. 
  The review is the result of a resolution issued last night 
by 
the JCE, which instructed the director of its vote-counting 
center to work with technicians appointed by the parties and the 
JCE advisers to review the released figures. 
  The PRD maintains that the numbers cited in JCE bulletins 
differ from those issued to the parties in diskettes that 
supposedly contain the same information. 
  The JCE vote-counting director admitted the discrepancy but 
explained that it is because the diskettes given to the parties 
do not always contain all the information released in the 
bulletins. 
  The method of review to be used by the JCE technicians and 
the parties has not been revealed.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by provisional President Emile </F>
Jonassaint by Rothchild Francois, Jr. at the National Palace in 
Port-au-Prince on 19 May; simultaneous translation of English 
into French and French into English -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Francois] Attorney Emile Jonassaint, the 
provisional president of the Republic, agreed to answer 
questions by Haitian and foreign journalists at the National 
Palace. Answering a question about the nonexistence of a prime 
minister within his government, Mr. Jonassaint, the provisional 
president, officially declared that the Constitution has yet [as 
heard] been revoked. He pointed out that his cabinet is 
responsible to parliament. 
  Concerning rumors of a invasion as a resolution of the 
Haitian crisis, Attorney Emile Jonassaint pointed out that Haiti 
cannot struggle against the United States and that a U.S. 
military intervention to resolve the crisis would be a crime. 
  Concerning the embargo, attorney Jonassaint announced that 
his government is going to take important measures to manage the 
international embargo, which will become a total embargo as of 
this weekend. Let us listen to an excerpt of statements by Emile 
Jonassaint, who immediately pointed out that there is no 
friction between the Army and his government. Answering a 
question regarding General Cedras, he pointed out that Gen. 
Cedras is commander in chief for three years. 
  [Begin recording] [Jonassaint] Gen. Cedras was appointed for 
three years. 
  [Francois] Mr. President, resigning Prime Minister Robert 
Malval has called on taxpayers to boycott -- if you would -- the 
fiscal system. This is a call for fiscal disobedience. How do 
you interpret such a statement? Will your government let itself 
be pushed around in case the taxpayers refuse to pay taxes? 
  [Jonassaint] Mr. Malval has already asked all employees to 
resist, did he not, but nothing has been done so far. Besides, 
did he, himself not say on 7 February when the parliament 
convened that as resigning prime minister, he had nothing 
further to do with the business of Haiti. If Mr. Malval makes 
some mistake or commits some infraction of the law, he will fall 
under the provisions of the law. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, do you intend to rule 
by decrees? A number of people say you [words indistinct] the 
Constitution. How do you intend to rule? 
  [Jonassaint] The Constitution has not yet been revoked. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, your government does not have a 
prime minister. Is that constitutional? 
  [Jonassaint] The prime minister... [pauses] all the 
ministers 
have the right to go into parliament to defend the projects of 
the government even if there is interpellation. The prime 
minister is not the only one. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Malval said that your government is not legal 
and that you are not the president. 
  [Jonassaint] That is his opinion. 
  [Reporter] It is also the opinion of the international 
community. Do you not have a sense of being alone against the 
world? 
  [Jonassaint] Haiti has always been alone, ever since it 
became independent. Even those whom Haiti helped to become 
independent took sides against Haiti. This is a fact that 
everybody knows. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, are you concerned that the U.S. 
might invade Haiti [words indistinct]? 
  [Jonassaint] Haiti does not have atomic bombs. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] what would you do and what 
will 
you do to prevent that? 
  [Jonassaint] To avoid it? If the United States invaded 
Haiti, 
it would simply be a crime. [end recording] 
  That was an excerpt from the news conference held by the 
provisional president, Emile Jonassaint. You will receive more 
details during the upcoming newscasts.

<F P=106> [Speech by provisional President Emile Jonassaint on 18 May, </F>
Haitian Flag and University Day, from his home in Freres, 
Petion-Ville -- recorded] 
  [Text] My dear fellow citizens: Here we are, at a moment in 
our history at which we are duty-bound to think about the causes 
that have torn asunder the fabric of the nation. The fatherland 
today calls for an awakening in all diverted and manipulated 
consciences, invites them to save our ancestors' legacy. Yes, 
the legacy is a heavy one; nevertheless, we must find the 
strength to bear it together. On this 18 May 1994, I am saying 
to you, here, the same thing I said in Arcahaie 44 years ago on 
behalf of the Senate of the Republic. Let us again take this day 
to pass to one another the torch of unity. Let us forget our 
resentments, hatreds, and quarrels, sources of deep bruises for 
the nation, so as to examine our motto: In Unity Lies Strength. 
  On this 18 May 1994 here we are, again, at a watershed in 
our 
history, when the unity of this people is as urgent a need as it 
was on the day of our independence, so that we can compel 
recognition as a nation. 
  My dear fellow citizens: Already nearly 200 years ago, 
rallied behind the flag, on behalf of peace and the universal 
rights of citizens, we fought the decisive battle for freedom, 
thereby responding to the cries of despair and sufferings of 
millions of men and women remaining in the enemy's chains. Let 
us unite. 
  The symbol of a rallying and of solidarity among the 
population, our bi-colored flag still highlights the proud epic 
of our ancestors. I want this anniversary to be used to 
reconcile Haitians among themselves, as brothers from the same 
nation. The anguished fatherland today has the right to solemnly 
demand the help of its children. It does not wish to believe 
that its own sons could exacerbate even further the wounds of 
its distress. [As an] achievement of our people's pride, 
although our flag is rent asunder, let us recover the shreds, so 
that we can again hoist our bi-colored flag before the world. 
Let us together protect its honor. 
  In Unity Lies Strength. Hail Haiti! Thank you.

  [Text] In a message to the nation on the occasion of 18 May 
[Flag and University Day], Haitian head of state Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, who has been living in exile since the 30 September 
1991 coup d'etat, says he applauds the courage the Haitian 
people (?have shown) since the beginning of the crisis. The 
president sent a message of unity, reiterating that an end must 
be put to the tragic situation the population has been 
experiencing for a very long time now. 
  [Begin Aristide recording] The flag of unity has existed 
since 18 May 1803, so Haitians can live freely in a free Haiti. 
Let us doff our hat to our flag. 
  We, like all other peoples, have a flag. It is not a gift 
from foreign colonists; nor a trinket, merely for display; nor 
an ornament for outward show. Our flag resulted from a battle 
against slavery. The blood of our ancestors was shed so all 
peoples would respect us, once we respect one another. 
  Let us doff our hat to our flag. Every time we hoist our 
flag, what we are hoisting is the symbol of that very freedom. 
Every time we sing our national anthem, we are swearing ipso 
facto that Haitians live freely in a country that is theirs. 
  Let us doff our hat to our flag. That must be done. We must 
have it done. We must all join hands so that Haiti can be 
released from any disguised form of slavery. 
  The dreams of our students are our nice university dreams. 
[sentence as heard] Congratulations to you! An avalanche of 
admiration and respect to the memory of all students who (?have 
died), like stars of hope! To (?honor) their memory, we must 
lift Haiti's chin. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The diplomatic corps have answered resigning 
Prime Minister Robert Malval's invitation to support the 
legitimate Haitian Government. Several diplomats accredited to 
Port-au-Prince say they do not favor a foreign military 
intervention in Haiti to dislodge the military rulers. Let us 
listen to Mirlene Joanis. 
  [Begin recording] [Joanis] The four countries that claim to 
be Haiti's friends asserted once again at the residence of Prime 
Minister Robert Malval that the rumors of military intervention 
are unfounded. U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Lacy Swing 
reaffirmed the intention of the United States to carry on with 
the negotiated, diplomatic path. [passage omitted] 
  [Venezuelan Ambassador Elsa Boccheciampe] The Venezuelan 
ambassador to Haiti has the same opinion as the little Friends 
of Haiti. "We are part of the group of friends; we make 
decisions; and we share the opinions of the group of friends." 
  [Joanis] French Charge d'Affaires (Philippe Seltz) says: We 
just support a deployment of MINUHA [the United Nations Mission 
in Haiti]. But is the decision, made jointly by the military 
rulers and some parliamentarians, not a slap in the face of the 
international community? (Seltz) thinks Haitians are sovereign 
in their country and they can do what they want. 
  [(Seltz)] "The Haitians are sovereign and [words 
indistinct]." 
  [Joanis] If Haitians are sovereign, why is the French charge 
d'affaires at the Malval residence? 
  [(Seltz)] "It is simply because he invited us to come today. 
In fact, as he told you, we talked about issues relating to the 
university. He wished to know our viewpoint on certain 
proposals. When the legitimate prime minister asks me to visit 
him, I do so, just as my colleagues in the diplomatic corps 
would." 
  [Joanis] As for Canadian Charge d'Affaires (Louis Robert 
D'Aigle), Canada is still on the diplomatic path for restoring 
democracy. 
  [(D'Aigle)] "Here we maintain the same hope, the 
(?conviction) that the crisis will be resolved in the general 
interest of the Haitian people as they expressed it in (?1987)." 
  [Joanis] "[words indistinct] President Aristide will no 
longer officially be president." 
  [(D'Aigle)] "Listen, we will see at that moment. It is 
perhaps... [pauses] Politically, 12 months is an eternity. We 
must always, we are going to support all efforts aimed at 
restoring constitutional order." 
  [Unidentified reporter] "Canada does not favor a military 
intervention in Haiti?" 
  [(D'Aigle)] "[words indistinct] expressed himself very 
clearly about that. We have thought about adopting complete 
sanctions, which will undoubtedly be enforced this weekend. We 
will see at that time." 
  [Reporter] "Mr. Ambassador, are you optimistic about a 
possible return of President Aristide to the country?" 
  [(D'Aigle)] "I have an optimistic nature." 
  [Joanis] Within the scope of the negotiated diplomatic path, 
(William Gray), who replaces Mr. Pezzullo in the Haitian crisis, 
will arrive in Haiti next week. Does this emissary intend to 
meet either with the military rulers or with the de facto 
government? Mr. Swing does not know. 
  [Swing] "I do not know yet. I do not know [words 
indistinct]. I did not talk about that. I do not know what the 
agenda upon his visit to Haiti will be. I do not know." 
  [Joanis] Whereas the Haitian crisis has reached a watershed 
with the installation of Attorney Jonassaint to power, the four 
countries that say they are Haiti's friends have stuck to their 
positions. They have the same speech. The speech is not 
renewed. Everyone is wondering what the country's democratic 
future will be. Observers are very worried. But Prime Minister 
Robert Malval has no reason not to believe in the good 
intentions of the international community. 
  [Malval] "I have no reason not to believe in them. In 
October, I expressed the reproaches I had to level at the 
international community." 
  [Jonais] The friendly countries, the little Friends of Haiti 
have taken a clear stand. For the time being, they are not 
favorable to the idea of military intervention. They favor 
instead a total and complete embargo, a sanction that will be 
effective as of 22 May. [end recording]

  [Text] PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva on 13 May supported the nationwide strikes 
against the economic plan of Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 
who is the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] presidential 
candidate and former finance minister. Yesterday in Rio de 
Janeiro, Lula installed the Popular Brazil Front. This is a 
coalition of parties that support his candidacy (PT, PSB 
[Brazilian Socialist Party], PPS [People's Socialist Party], PC 
do B [Communist Party of Brazil], PCB [Brazilian Communist 
Party], and PST-U [Unified Social Workers Party]). 
  Lula said: "The demands by Federal Police agents are 
justified. The government called in the Army because it is unfit 
for dialogue." The PT candidate said that the claim that the 
strikes are political "is an old story." He noted that the PT 
opposed the economic plan since it was set in motion -- not 
since Cardoso became a candidate. Lula said the plan was not 
harmed by the strike, it was harmed because Cardoso "escaped 
from the responsibility" of managing it to become a candidate. 
"He should have raised his baby," he said. 
  The Popular Brazil Front was set in motion during a lunch at 
the Brazil Automobile Club building, in downtown Rio de Janeiro. 
The reception was attended by Lula, by PSB Senator Jose Paulo 
Bisol, who is Rio Grande do Sul and Lula's running mate, and by 
coalition party leaders. The reception was attended by 160 
persons who each paid $15. While unionist Ciro Garcia (PST-U) 
was defending the strikes, 85-year old Parana representative 
Cordolina Fontelles handed Lula a landless people's flag. She 
is the mother of Deputy Paulo Fontelles who was murdered in an 
agrarian conflict in June 1987. 
  CUT [Sole Workers Center] President Jair Menguelli said that 
of the 5 million plus workers whose collective bargaining date 
is in May, less than 200,000 are on strike. "It is a small 
number compared to other years. Strikes should continue," he 
said.

  [Excerpts] Former President Jose Sarney was defeated twice 
on 18 May at the Federal Supreme Court [STF]. By a 10-1 vote, 
the STF first turned down a petition filed by the Social 
Christian Party [PSC] requesting an extension of the period in 
which a prospective candidate can join the party for which he 
will be running. The STF thus dismissed the PSC contention that 
the deadlines established by the electoral laws are 
unconstitutional. By a unanimous decision, the STF also ruled 
that incumbent senators are not, by virtue of their office 
alone, entitled to seek their party's nomination to any elective 
office at the party convention. As a result of those two 
rulings, Sarney will not be able to join another party to seek 
his presidential nomination. [passage omitted] 
  Through his aides, Senator Sarney announced that he will not 
leave the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party [PMDB]. He has 
already decided, however, not to attend the PMDB convention 
scheduled for 22 May. He has concluded that the situation 
within the PMDB remains favorable to Orestes Quercia. Sarney is 
determined, however, to continue participating in the succession 
process, but he will only decide how he will do this within the 
next few days. [passage omitted] 
  Sarney will wait for the Sao Paulo Superior Court ruling in 
Quercia's case before deciding to support the presidential 
candidacy of Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso (Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party). Quercia is facing charges of fraud in 
connection with electronic equipment imported from Israel during 
the final stage of his tenure as Sao Paulo governor. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Ronaldo Brasiliense] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Environment and Legal Amazon Region Ministry 
is threatening to dismantle six national parks, three biological 
reserves, seven national forests, two environmentally protected 
areas, and four rational exploitation reserves. As these units 
have not been legally registered within the period contemplated 
in the laws, their status will become void. This is an 
unprecedented retrogressive step in the Brazilian environmental 
policy. Two of the threatened units are in Rio de Janeiro: the 
Tingua biological reserve, which was created on 23 May 1989, and 
the Mario Xavier national forest, which was created in October 
1989. 
  In accordance with Article 10 of Decree 3365 dated 21 June 
1941, the legal registration of these units, which were created 
by the federal government, "must be made effective through 
agreements or obtained judicially within five years of the date 
on which the decree is published. At the end of this period, 
the terms of the decree become void." When this happens, the 
unit can only be the object of a new decree after one year. 
  The Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable 
Natural Resources (Ibama), which is responsible for the 
administration, preservation, and maintenance of the 
preservation units, allegedly has no funds to finance the legal 
registration of these units which were created at the end of 
Jose Sarney's administration and the beginning of Fernando 
Collor administration. Several areas were created as an 
ecological marketing strategy a few days before the UN 
Conference on Environment and Development (Rio-92) in an attempt 
to show the world that Brazil, which had been harshly criticized 
internationally for deforestation and clearing land by fire in 
the Amazon Region, was concerned about environmental 
preservation. 
  Research by Ibama experts before Rio-92 showed that the 
government would have to invest $1.2 billion to legally register 
the land on which Brazilian national parks, biological reserves, 
ecological stations, national forests, environmentally protected 
areas, and rational exploitation reserves are situated. 
  The first warning of the threat that has been affecting 
these 
units was made by Atanagildo Matos, also known as Gatao, who is 
the president of the National Council of Rubber Tappers. Gatao 
is the successor to ecologist Chico Mendes. He reported that 
five rational exploitation reserves created during the Collor 
administration are threatened with being dismantled because of 
Ibama's negligence in legally registering the expropriated areas. 
  On 10 May, Atanagildo Matos and Federal Deputy Sidney de 
Miguel (Green Party-Rio de Janeiro) met Environment Minister 
Henrique Cavalcanti and called for urgent measures to prevent 
Brazil from losing these units, which are important for the 
preservation of the national flora and fauna. Their loss would 
be a tremendous blow for the Brazilian environmental policy. 
[passage omitted] 
  The National Center for Sustained Development of Traditional 
Peoples succeeded in legally registering 2.1 million hectares of 
the Alto Jurua and Chico Mendes rational exploitation reserves 
in Acre State; the Cajari River reserve in Amapa State; and the 
Ouro Preto reserve in Rondonia State. The Chico Mendes rational 
exploitation reserve in Xapuri and Brasileia counties, with 
970,000 hectares, shelters 7,500 people and was demarcated with 
the assistance of the Army Cartographic Service. The land of 
the Cajari River reserve, with 481,000 hectares and 5,000 
inhabitants, still has not been totally registered because the 
Jari Project is questioning its legality in the courts. 
  The nine rational exploitation reserves created by the 
Brazilian Government cover an overall area of 2.2 million 
hectares and have 28,460 inhabitants who live basically on 
rubber gathering, Brazil-nut harvest, and babassu exploitation.

  [Text] Salvador, Brazil, 11 May (PL) -- Cuban President 
Fidel Castro arrived today in this northeastern Brazilian city 
during a service stopover on his return flight from South Africa 
to Cuba. 
  The Cuban president visited Pretoria, the South African 
capital, where he participated in the inauguration of President 
Nelson Mandela. 
  The Cubana de Aviacion flight landed at the Dos de Julio Air 
Base in the capital of Bahia state, where Fidel Castro and his 
entourage were greeted by current Governor Antonio Imbassahy, 
former governor Carlos Magalhaes, Ramon Sanchez Parodi, the 
Cuban ambassador to Brazil, and other local personalities. 
  This is the second time the Cuban president has visited 
Salvador and the fourth time he has visited Brazil. 
  Fidel visited Brasilia in early 1990 for the presidential 
inauguration that year. In June 1992 he attended the world 
summit on the environment in Rio de Janeiro, and in July 1993 he 
visited Salvador Bahia to participate in the third 
Ibero-American conference. 
  According to official sources cited by the local press, the 
Cuban president will remain approximately 12 hours in Brazilian 
territory, although no official agenda was announced for his 
visit. 
  Organizations of friendship and solidarity with Cuba as well 
as other associations in Bahia said they wanted to give Fidel 
Castro a great reception.

  [Text] Havana, 12 May (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
returned to Havana today after participating in the historic 
inauguration of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first black 
president. 
  Castro and the high-level delegation accompanying him 
arrived 
in Cuba at 2119 GMT and were welcomed by Army General Raul 
Castro, vice president of the Council of State and Council of 
Ministers and Armed Forces chief, and other ranking leaders. 
  Fidel Castro's arrival in South Africa on 9 May to attend 
Mandela's presidential inauguration ceremony was a milestone in 
the traditional ties of friendship and solidarity between Havana 
and Africa. 
  The Cuban president and his entourage held several bilateral 
meetings in Pretoria with over 20 statesmen and well-known 
figures from Africa and the Middle East. Castro also granted 
interviews to various news media from South Africa and other 
countries. 
  Significant and historic were among the descriptives used by 
sources close to Fidel Castro in reference to his conversation 
with the African National Congress (ANC) leader and new 
President Nelson Mandela, to whom Castro expressed Cuba's 
resolve to initiate and develop multilateral cooperation. 
  Another important event was the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between both states on 11 May, based on a protocol 
signed by Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto 
Robaina and Alfred Nzo, respectively. This, reports indicated, 
was the first foreign policy decision of the new ANC government. 
  Fidel Castro thus concluded a tour that began in Barbados, 
where he attended the First World Conference on Sustainable 
Development of Small Island States, which ended on 6 May. 
  At that regional forum, he urged developed nations to stop 
polluting the environment and called for the equitable 
distribution of wealth in the world to bridge the growing gap 
between poor and wealthy states. 
  After the meeting in the Barbadian capital, where he also 
met 
with dignitaries and well-known conference attendees, the Cuban 
president visited Ghana in western Africa during a technical 
stopover en route to South Africa. 
  His stay in Accra, although brief, was considered official 
by 
Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings, who welcomed Castro at 
Katoka Airport for a friendly meeting. 
  The Cuban delegation, comprised also of National Assembly 
President Ricardo Alarcon and Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of 
science, technology, and environment, traveled from Pretoria to 
Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, which, in July 1993, hosted the Third 
Ibero-American Summit. 
  On that stopover en route to Havana, the head of the Cuban 
Revolution also conducted various official activities with the 
authorities in Salvador de Bahia, capital of Bahia State, who, 
last night, gave a reception in his honor at Ondina Palace, 
headquarters of the state government.

<F P=106> [By Walfredo Angulo] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 11 May (PL) -- Speculation is an ancient and 
objectionable occupation practiced by individuals who buy and 
sell articles, merchandise, or property. Some clerical 
employees make a living from it. 
  The former were held in check in Havana by official 
provisions announced following the extraordinary session of the 
Cuban National Assembly on 1 and 2 May. The provisions decreed 
that property would be confiscated from individuals linked to 
the black market, illicit enrichment, and other illegal 
activities that are repudiated by the people. 
  The implementation of this decree-law is consistent with 
requests that speculators and individuals who divert state 
resources be punished. The requests were made by some 3 million 
workers at approximately 80,000 parliaments in the workplace 
held over the past few months throughout the country. 
  The decree-law is also one of several guidelines approved by 
the deputies to reorganize Cuba's domestic finances in view of 
the excess of currency in circulation, surpassing 11.2 billion 
pesos (equivalent to the dollar at the official exchange rate), 
and the approximately 4.2 billion peso budget deficit. 
  The clerks are "theorizing" while these measures are being 
implemented in a country that must readjust 85 percent of its 
foreign trade because of the fall of its former commercial 
partners, particularly the USSR, and in the midst of the 
intensification of the U.S. blockade. 
  While some people characterize the Assembly's decisions as a 
"drastic adjustment plan," others view it as "slow, moderate 
reform." 
  According to Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and price 
minister, 
Cuban experts have confirmed that the announced measures should 
be implemented gradually over several months. 
  Some even say that the black market is "the most efficient 
economy in Cuba," thus attempting to legalize the theft of state 
resources with the trite phrase used by local diplomatic sources. 
  President Fidel Castro told the deputies that existing laws 
must be enforced so those who conduct illegal trade or 
activities will not go unpunished. 
  Others who speculate about Cuba's reality and ruminate about 
the "hidden plan," go a step further and write about an 
imaginary power struggle that has allegedly broken out among the 
country's top leaders. This struggle pits politicians and 
economists against each other and indiscriminately links 
distinguished figures from either side. 
  National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon told PRENSA 
LATINA that the consensus reached through the deputies' 
decisions resulted from that body's preparedness for the debate 
on the controversial subject and also from the process he 
described as the parliamentarization of Cuban society, which 
began several months ago. 
  Cuban politicians and economists say the informational 
biases 
that certain people unwittingly represent make them see darkness 
where there is only light.

  [Text] Havana, 11 May (PL) -- Cuba will apply only legal 
and constitutional measures in its declared war on illegal 
wealth, but without permitting a "witch hunt" or corruption, an 
authorized source told PRENSA LATINA today. 
  The Attorney General's Office is putting the final touch to 
Decree-Law 149 after it was promulgated following 
recommendations by the National Assembly of the People's 
Government and the demands of 80,000 workers assemblies held 
throughout the country. 
  A source close to the Attorney General's Office has reported 
to PRENSA LATINA that the procedure to be applied envisions, 
after the corresponding information is received and analyzed, 
taking cautionary measures on the assets of individuals known as 
"money hoarders" and giving them a 10-day deadline to prove the 
legal origin of their money. 
  Money hoarders have amassed huge sums of money and purchased 
properties with profits obtained through black market dealings 
in staples, scams, or fraudulent transactions, all of which are 
being continually criticized by the population. 
  The seizure, which could even mean that the properties 
remain 
in the hands of the suspects but under control of the 
corresponding authorities, will be accompanied by the drafting 
of a report addressed to the Finance and Price Ministry, the 
agency authorized to order the seizure. That is to say, the 
assets whose legitimate origins are in doubt are not 
automatically seized because this penalty is just the 
culmination of a process. It is possible to file an appeal with 
the finance and price minister. 
  This is to prevent errors in enforcing the decree and 
strictly obey the law, respecting the rights of those eventually 
accused, and applying administrative measures only as a general 
standard. 
  There is no intention to send individuals found guilty of 
acquiring illegal wealth to prison. The intention is to deprive 
them of their illegally obtained assets and return the assets to 
society. 
  Of course, as the same source confirmed, this does not mean 
the authorities will be weak in the presence of activities 
widely criticized by the people and which further negatively 
affect the economic difficulties the country faces at present. 
  It is necessary to reaffirm the duty to respect the ethical 
and moral concepts that exist in Cuban society. The law will be 
applied to anyone who attempts to ignore these principles, the 
source said. 
  All of the dispositions stipulated in the decree and its 
bylaws will comply with the current constitutional precepts. 
Those who hamper the investigations of the Attorney General's 
Office will be penalized. 
  Another aspect to be taken into consideration is that the 
current campaign will only be part of the permanent fight 
against the aforementioned illegal activities, some of which 
have increased in the country's current situation and which will 
never be seen as a chance happening. 
  Finally, it was reported that any legal actions to disguise 
the illegal acquisition of wealth will be regarded as null and 
void. In the battle against these offenses will participate 
  All state agencies, the rank-and-file organizations, and the 
current special vigilance and protection system will participate 
in the battle against these offenses.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Elsy Fors: "The Unveiling of the </F>
Adjustments"] 
  [Text] Havana -- On 5 May, Havana woke up shaken by a 
double tornado. The winds, unexpected and violent, ushered in 
the issue of the official war declaration on the "currency 
hoarders" -- the local nickname given to speculators. 
  Forty-eight hours after the closing of a special session of 
the National Assembly of the People's Government (Cuban 
Parliament), the Council of State complied with its first 
mandate -- to take strong action against those who have an 
illegitimate patrimony, be it the result of robbery, 
speculation, or the diversion of public funds. 
  Other measures, which will affect the entire population, 
will 
be announced more calmly and in no more than 18 months. Cubans 
are currently concerned over a prospective rise in the cost of 
living, but they are willing to face it so long as the national 
economy and their own living standards improve in the long run. 
  For over three decades, Cubans have lived under nearly 
absolute state protection. They did not have to worry about 
paying taxes or any other fiscal obligations, but the days of 
the paternalistic state seem to be drawing to a close. 
  The shortcomings resulting from the collapse of Cuba's 
leading commercial partner in the former socialist bloc 
contributed to the shortcomings prompted by the U.S. blockade, 
internal deficiencies, and the absence of fiscal obligations to 
the depletion of the Treasury. 
  Now, without any more delays, the country will proceed to 
restore order to its internal finances. With this objective, 
the National Assembly met in a special session on 1 and 2 May. 
  According to the figures revealed by Jose Luis Rodriguez, 
minister president of the State Committee for Finance, at the 
end of March, currency excess in the population's hands amounted 
to 11.636 billion pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official 
Cuban exchange rate) while the budget deficit amounted to 4.2 
billion pesos. 
  Cuban academic sources are of the opinion that the excess 
money in the hands of the population -- equivalent to 
approximately 15 months of wages for all the workers in the 
country -- is unequally distributed. Therefore, out of the 59 
percent of this amount deposited in banking accounts, one-fourth 
corresponds to only 1 percent of savings accounts. [sentence as 
received] 
  The situation became difficult in 1987, the last year in 
which the budget was virtually balanced. Since then, in the 
first measures implemented to correct the imbalance, the state 
assumed the weight of the adjustment, by issuing currency 
without compensatory backing. 
  Between 1989 and 1993, the country's import capacity fell 
from more than $8 billion to only $2.2 billion. This had a 
multiplying effect on domestic agriculture and industrial 
production, which were virtually paralyzed for lack of fuel, 
fertilizers, and other materials. 
  The main effects of the crisis on the population were a 
decrease in food, scarcity of medicine, and a severe reduction 
in electricity and urban transportation. Besides that, most 
Cubans had to turn to the black market to obtain basic products 
such as soap, detergent, and cooking oil. 
  The reform was begun without a set model. In what were the 
first firm steps, on 14 August, the Cuban Government 
decriminalized the holding and use of dollars and other strong 
foreign currencies among the population. It also changed a 
large part of the agriculture sector, which had been 
government-managed up to then, into cooperatives. 
  This was followed by an in-depth reorganization of the 
state apparatus in April 1994, which reduced ministries and 
payrolls. 
  According to specialists at the Center of Cuban Economic 
Studies (CEEC), the increase in tourism -- the second most 
important foreign exchange generator after sugar -- the increase 
in the production of nickel and domestic oil pointed toward the 
initiation of a partial recovery at the end of 1993. This 
prompted the government to find the necessary national consensus 
for the adjustments required to stimulate the incipient 
improvement. 
  This was how a process called "the workers parliament" 
started and the country's problems and the possible solutions 
were studied in 80,000 assemblies held at work centers. The 
common denominator of those assemblies was the unanimous demand 
for the government to act against the people who profited from 
the country's shortages. 
  The country's finances, however, require something more than 
the elimination of "money hoarders." In this sense, the 
corresponding minister proposed that tax revenues be increased 
and that savings and economic efficiency be encouraged. He also 
proposed that several subsidies be eliminated and did not deny 
the possibility of a future currency replacement. 
  Jose Luis Rodriguez recommended that currency be collected 
by 
increasing the prices on fuel, cigarettes, and alcoholic 
beverages. Also, that electricity, postal, and telephone rates 
be augmented, dependent on the improvement of those services, 
which are currently deficient. 
  In an effort to promote economic efficiency, several months 
ago, material incentives were given to workers in priority 
fields such as in the sugar, mining, nickel, and electricity 
sectors. This measure has resulted in important production 
advancements. 
  Another of the proposals to obtain revenues was through 
taxes. The taxes applied to persons who have been self-employed 
for the past year will be increased and it is estimated they 
will contribute not less than 126 million pesos to the 1994 
budget. 
  The elimination of subsidies is expected. This includes 
charging for sports and cultural events, as well as school 
lunches, school supplies for junior and high school students, 
and some medicine such as Neovitamin -- a vitamin supplement 
distributed without cost to the population since the outbreak of 
the optic neuritis epidemic in 1993. 
  Regarding the replacement of the currency, economists such 
as 
Osvaldo Martinez, the president of the Economic Affairs 
Committee in the parliament, believe the measure would not have 
a lasting effect on the reappearance of the black market. Its 
defenders, however, claim the change attempts to achieve other 
financial control objectives. 
  The measures, which are still not all known, according to 
the 
parliament's final resolution "will lead to gradually being able 
to surmount the current difficulties" and will ensure the 
protection of the low-income sectors. 
  Despite all the foreseeable difficulties, the truth is that 
Cuba is launching an independent development, which foreign 
specialists and investors consider to be more advantageous in 
the long term.

  [Text] United Nations, 17 May (PL) -- Today, Cuba claimed 
it continues to be subject to an intensive radio broadcasting 
campaign supported by the U.S. Government which is aimed at 
imposing foreign political models on that contry. 
  Cuban delegate Edgardo Valdes, who participated in the 
general debates of the sessions of the UN Committee on 
Information, described those actions as a clear violation of his 
country's sovereignty and of international regulations on 
peaceful coexistence among states. 
  Valdes said those actions are also contrary to the 
information order promoted by this committee and contravene 
international rules and regulations on communications signed by 
all countries, including the United States. 
  He recalled that at a recent conference on sustained 
development of small islands held in Barbados, UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said "no single theory, model, or 
group of priorities can be imposed from abroad" and urged each 
society to choose its own path. 
  This radio policy, however, is being used against Cuba, with 
the excuse of an alleged need to inform Cubans, claiming to have 
the authority to define what is described as a "free flow of 
information." More than 15 radio stations and one television 
station are broadcasting to Cuba, Valdes protested. 
  "Cuba rejects the continuation of that practice and warns 
that no attempt to increase those broadcasts will go 
unanswered," he noted. Valdes added that as the U.S. Congress 
control office has admitted, programs broadcast by those 
stations "ignore the majority of positive news about Cuba, or 
they are reinterpreted or mystified," and that frequent calls 
are made to change the current political system. 
  Valdes said there are 1.7 radios per family in Cuba, more 
than 100 international broadcasts can be heard, including VOA, 
and that 400 out of the 600 Western films shown each year are 
from the United States. 
  He added that there is free access to publications of 
various 
kinds in libraries and document centers, the national television 
rebroadcasts CNN, CBS, and other networks' reports, while 120 
foreign journalists live in Cuba and hundreds visit the country 
each year. 
  "Even if this were not the case, no foreign government has 
the right to decide what the information policy of a sovereign 
state should be, ignoring the most basic principles of [words 
indistinct] Valdes stressed.

  [Text] Havana, 14 May (PL) -- Cuba and Colombia will sign 
here on Tuesday an agreement that will permit the establishment 
of regular airline flights to link the capitals of the two 
countries. 
  A Cuban civil aviation source confirmed to PRENSA LATINA 
today that the signing of the document will conclude the current 
negotiations under way between the Colombian Aeronautics 
Directorate and the Cuban Civil Aeronautics Institute (IACC) 
aimed at achieving the objective noted above. 
  Fernando Zarama heads the Colombian delegation that will 
hold 
meetings with the IACC representatives on Monday in order to 
give the final touches to the agreement. 
  Currently Cubana de Aviacion and Medellin Aeronautics 
Association (SAM) charter flights are made periodically between 
the two Latin American nations and contribute, among other 
things, to developing bilateral tourist trade, especially from 
Santa Fe de Bogota to Havana and Varadero. 
  The agreement, which should conclude with the signing of the 
treaty this coming week, seeks to determine the frequency and 
characteristics of the regular flights, which will further 
increase permanent air transit between the two countries. 
  In addition to SAM, the Venezuelan VIASA and Chilean LADECO 
companies have flights between Cuba and Colombia. 
  The agreement that is about to be signed further strengthens 
Cuban-Colombian relations, which showed a great improvement 
early this year. 
  The Colombian Naval Training Ship ARC GLORIA is scheduled to 
arrive this coming week in Havana on a goodwill visit and as 
part of the training that Colombian midshipmen receive. 
  Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos is also 
expected to visit Cuba to sign the expansion of the current 
partial agreement, which will expand bilateral commercial 
activities. 
  A delegation of Colombian businessmen, who are interested in 
investing in Cuba, are also expected soon in Havana, Colombian 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin has announced.

  [Text] Havana, 18 May (PL) -- Today in this capital, Cuba 
and Colombia signed an agreement of understanding that will lead 
to the establishment of regular flights of the two countries' 
airlines. 
  The document was signed by Fernando Zarama, Colombian 
director of national civil aviation, and Argimiro Ojeda Vives, 
vice president of the Cuban Civil Aeronautics Institute (IACC). 
  The agreement specifies that airlines from the two Latin 
American nations may offer passenger, cargo, and mail services 
regularly and independently from the current weekly charter 
flights. 
  The agreement was the result of negotiations between 
delegations from the two countries with the participation of 
representatives of Cubana de Aviacion and the Colombian 
airlines, namely, SAM, Avianca, Intercontinental, Islena, and 
Transportes Aereos Mercantiles Panamericanos (Tampa). 
  Also present at the talks were Manuel Leal, representing the 
Association of Colombian Air Transporters, as well as other IACC 
and Cubana de Aviacion officials. 
  During the signing ceremony, Zarama described as important 
the agreement that established bilateral aeronautics relations, 
which reflect the friendship and solidarity that exist between 
the two nations. 
  Meanwhile, Colombian Ambassador to Cuba Ricardo Santamaria 
underscored the coincidence between the conclusion of the 
negotiations, a visit to Cuba by the Colombian Navy's school 
ship "Arc Gloria," and the conclusion of a visit to Havana of a 
delegation of businessmen interested in investing in the island. 
  Santamaria said the happy conclusion to the negotiations was 
the product of the Cubans' constructive attitude. He said that 
Cuba can count on Colombia as a loyal and friendly partner. 
  Ojeda underscored Cuba's satisfaction with the agreements 
and 
the need for unity and cooperation between the region's airlines 
from underdeveloped countries in order to survive and offer the 
services that their peoples require. 
  He said the ceremony took place on the 65th anniversary of 
Cubana de Aviacion and pointed out that it contributes to the 
development of relations between Colombia and Cuba.
