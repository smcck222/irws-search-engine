  [Text] An increase in production and a more efficient use 
of fuels allocated to Matanzas Province have resulted, from the 
point of view of efficient energy use, in relative savings, 
which totaled 16,000 tons of conventional fuel by the end of 
April. This information has been confirmed by a survey conducted 
by the Matanzas office of statistics. The survey adds that 
consumption of energy resources has decreased by nearly 13,000 
tons in comparison with the same period in 1993, while 
mercantile production has increased by 5.3 million pesos. 
  Statistics officials point out that only petroleum 
consumption was higher than projected, while there has been a 
decrease in electricity consumption of 7,000 megawatt-hours. 
  There are 35 enterprises in the province that have surpassed 
the electric consumption quotas. Among the enterprises that 
consume large amounts of energy, 25 have exceeded quotas -- 
among them the rope and thread factory; the Martires leather 
factory in Caguasu; the meat complex; the metal-tooling factory; 
and the Cuba Libre, Juan Avila, Reinol Garcia, Mexico, and 
Jovellanos Farming Complexes.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 24 May (AFP) -- Opposition 
presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the 
Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) today warned President 
Joaquin Balaguer that the country faces serious "political, 
economic, and moral consequences" if the post-electoral conflict 
is not resolved promptly. 
  In a letter sent to Balaguer around midnight yesterday and 
distributed to the media today, Pena Gomez urged Balaguer "to 
adopt timely measures, in view of the delicate situation, to 
ensure a normal solution of the electoral crisis." 
  According to government sources, the letter was read to 
Balaguer early today and stated that "should the current 
conflict not be resolved in due time, it will inflict serious 
economic, political, and moral damage on the Dominican Republic." 
  Pena Gomez faced Balaguer, an 87-year-old seeking reelection 
to a seventh term, in the 16 August [month as received] general 
elections, which produced a serious crisis. 
  Pena Gomez contested the elections hours after the voting 
concluded and claimed that a "scandalous fraud" had taken place 
through various forms of information manipulation that prevented 
"200,000 citizens from voting because they were reportedly 
replaced by a similar number of official party followers." 
  In his letter, Pena Gomez told Balaguer that "we are 
convinced that you will, in view of this delicate situation, 
adopt timely measures to ensure a normal solution of the current 
electoral crisis." 
  Pena Gomez also denounced the refusal of most magistrates of 
the Central Electoral Board (JCE) to give the PRD the voter list 
sent to the electoral boards. This list was reportedly 
distorted at the JCE computer center. 
  As of today, the JCE has not yet proclaimed a winner in the 
elections, but Balaguer is leading Pena Gomez by 1.01 percent 
with 98 percent of the votes counted. 
  Pena Gomez told the media that he will reject a vote recount 
that the JCE will begin tomorrow if the voter list is not 
produced. The JCE refused to produce the votes list that the 
opposition is demanding. According to the PRD, this list 
reflects the fraud committed by Balaguer's followers.

<F P=106> [News conference by Panamanian President Guillermo Endara </F>
with unidentified reports upon arriving at Toncontin Airport in 
Tegucigalpa; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Endara] ...the future discussion. My case is unique 
because I am attending the preparatory meeting, but another 
person will attend the summit. Ernesto Perez Balladares, who 
will be president then, will attend the summit in December. 
  [Reporter] What is Panama concerned about specifically? 
  [Endara] We are basically concerned about what concerns all 
Central Americans. We want to be treated equally, as friends of 
the United States. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] for example the pressures of 
international organizations on these countries. Do you think 
those pressures should not exist? 
  [Endara] I think there should be equality. We should be 
given 
the same benefits given to Mexico, for example. That is what we 
think. 
  [Reporter] The canal treaty with the United States concludes 
in 1999. Will it be renegotiated? 
  [Endara] As far as I am concerned, from the start of my term 
I emphatically said there would not be a renegotiation. I think 
that the political position of Perez Balladares.... [pauses] I 
know he should be the one to express it, but in any case, I 
understand that his position is the same as mine on this topic. 
There will be no renegotiation, the canal treaty will be 
fulfilled, and at noon on 31 December 1999 the canal will be 
turned over to us. 
  [Reporter] Southcom [U.S. Southern Command] continues in 
Panama? 
  [Endara] Southcom continues in Panama, but I must say that 
next week I will attend a ceremony that I have never attended 
before. Military events are frequently held on the canal bases, 
and the only one I have agreed to attend is one next week during 
which the first brigade is pulling out of Panama for good. It is 
the first withdrawal of troops from Panama, and I will be very 
happy to attend this event because as a Panamanian it is a very 
important moment. 
  [Reporter] What base [words indistinct]? 
  [Endara] It is not a base. It is a brigade, an infantry 
brigade. 
  [Reporter] Is Panama interested in joining Central America 
to 
be part of NAFTA? 
  [Endara] I, President Endara, only have three months left in 
office, and I think this is how it should be. The best way for 
Panama to join NAFTA is through Central America. This is 
advisable for Panama and for the Central Americans. 
Unfortunately, I have heard a different opinion from my 
successor. I think President-elect Perez Balladares believes 
that, because Panama has had such an important bilateral 
relationship with the United States throughout its history, 
perhaps better results could be obtained individually. I think 
he is mistaken, but, in any case, he is the one who is going to 
be president of Panama. Let us hope he will change his opinion, 
because I think he is mistaken. 
  [Reporter] Is your opinion, which is different from your 
successor, dangerous in Panama? 
  [Endara] No, [laughs] I hope not. One of the greatest 
achievements of my administration is the establishment of full 
freedom of opinion in Panama. In Panama, there is full freedom. 
You should see what reporters say about me. They have every 
right, and I support them 100 percent. I think this situation is 
irreversible. No one can change that. Perez Balladares has 
promised to maintain the same situation. I will continue to give 
my opinion with full freedom, as all Panamanians do now and, I 
am sure, will continue to do so in the future. 
  [Reporter] Are you going to bring up the canal issue with 
Vice President Gore? 
  [Endara] I do not know whether we are going to have time to 
discuss bilateral topics. Above all, we are going to address 
multilateral topics. We have to study some recent remarks by 
President Clinton regarding the provisional organization that 
will exist in the canal until 2000, when the canal is turned 
over to us. I do not want to negotiate or discuss this at this 
time because President Clinton has just issued the statements. I 
have my foreign affairs advisory commission and the Panamanian 
representatives in the Canal Commission analyzing Clinton's 
opinion about the new organization of the canal until 2000. I do 
not want to issue an opinion until I receive proper advice on 
what position Panama should adopt. Panama's position has to be 
thoroughly studied. 
  [Reporter] Who will guarantee the security of the canal 
after 
2000, because there will be no gringos or Panama Defense Forces? 
  [Endara] Look, the canal is defenseless. It is like a 
newborn 
baby. Any world power that wants to destroy it can do so even if 
the gringos and Russians are in the canal together. Therefore, 
the canal is defenseless. Now then, whatever must be defended in 
the canal can very well be protected by a police specialized in 
terrorist attacks. That is all that must be done. A police force 
can protect the canal perfectly well.

Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo with unidentified reporters; 
place and date not given; from the "National" Newscast -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] What is your opinion on the Sandinist 
Congress? 
  [Chamorro] Speaking as a simple citizen, I think the 
Sandinist Congress met as any political party would meet. Each 
party must deal with its own problems. 
  [Reporter] But who is your candidate, Daniel Ortega or Henry 
Ruiz? 
  [Chamorro] Young man, I do not have a candidate in any 
party. 
This development is fine as long as we consolidate the new 
democracy with the help of conservatives, liberals, social 
Christians, Sandinists, and [words indistinct]; as long as it is 
done for Nicaragua's sake. 
  [Reporter] Do you think the contradictions within the 
Sandinist National Liberation Front are real or just a smoke 
screen? 
  [Chamorro] I really could not say. God willing, they will 
benefit everyone. Everyone has a right to speak freely, to say 
what he likes. This is a party -- I repeat -- just like the 
liberals, conservatives, and social Christians. They should 
reach an agreement for the country's benefit. I think unity 
equals strength. I do not think anyone should (?perpetuate 
himself), however. 
  [Announcer] Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo also commented on 
the Sandinist Congress: 
  [Obando y Bravo] They will always be united and will try to 
attain power in the next term. Nothing else will happen. For the 
time being, there can be only criticism from and tension created 
by the media. 
  [Announcer] Dona Violeta was questioned about the possible 
presidential candidacy of Engineer Antonio Lacayo: 
  [Chamorro] [Words indistinct] informed, but he has not said 
so. He has not told me. Anyone who wishes to run should do so. 
  [Reporter] But would you support him? 
  [Chamorro] I cannot answer that yet.

report on 17 May 94 pp 1, 7 that says the economic cabinet on 16 
May formally asked the diplomatic representatives of donor 
countries for $180 million in additional aid for the next three 
years. Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said the additional 
funds would result in higher economic growth rates. In the 
meeting, the government presented to the community of donors a 
report on progress made toward the democratization and 
macroeconomic stabilization process. It highlighted the 
demobilization of the 3-80 Northern Front, the constitutional 
reform process, and the conclusion of the Enhanced Structural 
Adjustment Facility, ESAF, negotiations. Lacayo said Nicaragua 
is requesting additional resources, not in donations but in 
credit lines in the medium and long term to help the country's 
financial system.

<F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>
  [Text] Cecilia Alegre, Panamanian member of the Canal 
Commission, has described as positive the recommendations made 
by President Bill Clinton establishing a series of changes to 
the law that regulates the canal in order to permit its orderly 
transfer to Panama on 31 December 1999. Clinton sent to the 
U.S. Congress a series of recommendations on the Canal 
Commission legislation, including one on tolls. 
  Alegre said the initiatives are positive because most of 
them 
include the majority of the recommendations made by the Canal 
Commission's Board of Directors to the U.S. Administration a few 
months ago. "I would say that, in general, they are positive 
because they change the Commission to meet the needs of the 
canal traffic, making it more flexible for maritime commerce 
demands, giving the board more power to make needed changes, and 
better preparing the Commission for the transition," she added. 
  The Canal Commission is a U.S. federal agency whose board of 
directors is made up of five North Americans and four 
Panamanians. According to the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties, the 
canal will be totally in Panamanian hands on 31 December 1999. 
  Alegre said the Canal Commission presented its 
recommendations to Leon Panetta, director of the U.S. Office of 
Management and Budget. The majority of Clinton's recommendations 
"agree with ours," Alegre reiterated. 
  Clinton recommended that the process to establish tolls be 
carried out by the Canal Commission, not the U.S. president.

  [Text] Mario Boyd Galindo and Alonso Fernandez, legislators 
who form part of the Foreign Relations Committee, pointed out 
that President Bill Clinton's statements on the transfer of the 
canal to Panama hit the nail on the head, while adding that it 
is necessary to make certain amendments to the Torrijos-Carter 
Treaty. 
  Legislator Alonso Fernandez acknowledged that the treaty 
should undergo certain amendments because it was not discussed 
by the people. Meanwhile, Legislator Mario Boyd Galindo said 
anything that tends to ease the transition of the Panama Canal 
to the Panamanians is appropriate. 
  It can be pointed out that, according to Legislator Alonso 
Fernandez, the amendments to the Torrijos-Carter Treaty should 
be negotiated between the Panamanian president and the U.S. 
President. Meanwhile, Legislator Mario Boyd Galindo believes 
President Bill Clinton is giving Panama the importance it 
deserves because it is of vital importance for U.S. trade. 
  "Clinton's statements are very forceful because he knows 
very 
well that many Panamanians want the treaties to be amended, 
Legislator Alonso Fernandez indicated. Legislator Mario Boyd 
Galindo said: "The proposals made by President Bill Clinton to 
Congress to reorganize the Canal Commission's corps are fitting 
and necessary."

<F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de 
Rubio stated the two nations approved an agreement to legalize 
the immigration of approximately 15,000 citizens who have not 
processed their documents during the fifth meeting of the 
Neighboring Commission between Panama and Colombia. 
  Sanin de Rubio stressed "that this agreement will be in 
effect for citizens who arrived in Colombia or Panama two years 
ago." She also noted that "in the next two months, authorities 
will clearly demarcate the boundary stones on the 
Colombian-Panamanian border," which have not been inspected for 
years. 
  The border between the two nations is 263 km long and it 
only 
has 14 boundary stones. At the meeting, it was agreed to 
increase the number of stones to improve the border area. The 
work to establish the boundaries will be conducted by a joint 
commission, but the date has not yet been set. It was learned 
that the work might take place in the summer of 1995 when the 
two governments will verify the limits. 
  The meeting between the two governments included several 
agreements in which COPA, Avianca, and SAM airlines agreed to 
several exchanges. Colombian and Panamanian hotels signed a 
similar agreement. 
  Meanwhile, the Kuna Yala and Embera-Wounaan general 
congresses criticized the Neighboring Commission meeting because 
Indian representatives were not invited to discuss the opening 
of the Darien Gap. 
  The Indian population will be affected by the construction 
of 
the Inter-American highway, the railroad, drug trafficking, 
health issues, biodiversity conservation, and the environment. 
  The Indian chiefs questioned the meeting of the governments 
of Panama and Colombia because the rulers of these nations are 
not familiar with the situation of the Darien and Kuna Yala 
region. Only the Indian population, which has lived there for 
more than 500 years, know it.

  [Text] Jose Luis Sosa, who is currently one of the 
representatives of the president-elect in the transfer of power 
commission, will be the director of the State Security and 
National Defense Office in the administration that will be 
inaugurated on 1 September. 
  Currently the Public Security and National Defense office, 
led by Menalco Solis, former planning minister of the military 
regime, is made up of a specialized brigade that uses very 
modern communications equipment to keep President Guillermo 
Endara informed of everything that is taking place in the 
country. 
  A source linked with President-elect Ernesto Perez 
Balladares 
announced that tomorrow, Tuesday, Sosa and Gabriel Lewis 
Galindo, future foreign minister, will travel to Washington to 
meet with ranking U.S. Government officials. The Panamanian 
delegation will also meet with U.S. senators and businessmen to 
discuss topics related to economic and political relations 
between the two countries. 
  Sosa, an experienced businessman, and Francisco Sanchez 
Cardenas represent Perez Balladares in the commission for the 
transfer of power. Eduardo Linares and Joaquin Fernando Franco 
represent the government in the commission. 
  In addition to the security office, the Presidency of the 
Republic maintains the members of the Institutional Protection 
Service (SPI), which is charged with guarding the Palace of the 
Herons presidential palace and other state offices. 
  There are supposedly installations with computerized 
equipment in Amador that permit state security members to 
compile data and general information on different areas and 
topics.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 May (NA) -- On 23 May, President 
Carlos Menem conceded that the disagreement that broke out in 
the cabinet over the establishment of a Secretariat for 
Community Protection "may affect the Constituent Assembly," but 
only "marginally," he hastened to add. 
  Menem acknowledged that "there were some arguments" over the 
issue of the secretariat, although he made it clear that "there 
is no confrontation" and that activities "are going on as usual." 
  The head of state commented that "this situation will affect 
the Constituent Assembly, but not in a major way; it will have 
only a slight, practically insignificant bearing on the 
assembly." He confirmed that he will attend the opening session 
to be held in Parana [Entre Rios Province] on 25 May. 
  Menem did not rule out that "as in any election campaign, an 
offense of defamation, insults, and slander will be launched." 
  He noted that newspaper headlines, which reported on 
controversies within the cabinet, "will have some effect on 
people's way of thinking," but he stressed that "this does not 
influence the working of the administration in the least because 
there were only arguments, and not confrontations as the media 
reported." 
  The president labeled the arguments within the cabinet 
"normal," "especially in a government like this, in which 
changes are really dramatic." Hence, one "should not be 
surprised or alarmed." 
  With regard to the Secretariat for Community Protection, 
Menem said it will be "like any other thing that was established 
at cabinet level, many of which came directly under the 
jurisdiction of the president." 
  Menem, speaking on the La 9.90 radio station this morning, 
said "it is a secretariat like any other. The problem lies in 
the fact that there are eight laws on security, and they must be 
made compatible with the areas in which they are inserted." 
  He pointed out that the government "has been working" on the 
establishment of this secretariat "for a year." He nevertheless 
conceded that "perhaps information about the subject was 
deficient; some hasty words were uttered, and the events that 
are now public knowledge supervened." 
  Notwithstanding this, he reiterated that "these kinds of 
organizations pertaining to people's security already exist in 
the leading countries of the world, and it never crossed their 
minds to think they are like the Gestapo. These words 
(Gestapo-KGB) are used in the world of politics to stir up 
uneasiness among citizens," he added. 
  Menem again said that "once the law on ministries is amended 
following the constitutional reform, there will be a new 
ministry that will be entirely and exclusively charged with 
ensuring that the community is protected." 
  He went on to say that "those who feel ill at ease are 
obviously the ones who are going to wield less power and are 
therefore trying to create problems in the community." 
  The head of state believes that "those who are openly 
against 
the establishment of this secretariat are those whose actions 
seek to destroy the peace that reigns in Argentina, cause 
problems for democracy, and hamper the complete freedom we enjoy 
in our country."

  [Text] Brussels, 24 May (AFP-NA) -- On 24 May, the European 
Union (EU) and Argentina signed a fishing agreement pursuant to 
which a certain number of ships sailing under the EU flag are 
authorized to fish in Argentine territorial waters, while 
shipowners from both signatories will undertake joint ventures. 
  This is the first fishing agreement ever signed between the 
EU and a Latin American country. It will be initially effective 
for five years, and may possibly be automatically renewed for 
two more years. 
  The agreement was officially signed in Brussels after it had 
been accepted by the fishing ministers of the 12 EU member 
countries in October 1993 and ratified by the European and 
Argentine parliaments. The UK had abstained from voting last 
October due to its controversy with Argentina over the Malvinas 
islands. 
  The agreement provides that the EU is allowed to fish a 
quota 
of 120,000 tonnes of hake and 130,000 tonnes of other species 
(including squid and codfish) in Argentine territorial waters. 
  The number of fishing boats from the EU that will be able to 
operate in Argentine territorial waters amounts to 70, 20 of 
which will sail under the flag of one of the EU member 
countries, which will have rights to one-third of the quota 
granted by the Argentines. 
  The other 50 boats, which will be able to catch the 
remaining 
two-thirds of the quota, will sail under the Argentine flag, but 
will belong to joint ventures between EU and Argentine shipping 
companies or to Argentine companies funded by foreign capital. 
  The EU commits itself to reducing its customs duties (from 
15 
percent at present to 5 percent) on fishing products through 
annual import quotas. 
  The EU is to contribute 162.5 million ECU's ($187 million), 
of which 28 million ECU's ($32.2 million) will be earmarked for 
streamlining Argentina's port facilities, the funding of 
research programs, and professional and technical formation of 
Argentine fishermen. 
  EU sources have reported that by signing these agreements, 
the EU seeks to diminish fishing activities in its own 
territorial waters to stave off possible depletion and intensify 
exploitation in those territorial waters that are underexploited.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 May (NA) -- Today, the Foreign 
Ministry said that control operations carried out by the 
corvette Spiro against a Korean-flagged [as received] ship 
fishing illegally in Argentine waters were carried out "in 
accordance with international law and in coordination with the 
Foreign Ministry." 
  The Foreign Ministry thus approved the intervention by the 
Argentine corvette when it discovered the Korean ship Chin Yuan 
Hsing violating Argentine jurisdictional waters on 21 May. 
  The Argentine Navy reported today that the corvette Spiro 
stayed near the Korean ship "given the adverse weather 
conditions, and fulfilling its responsibilities of sea search 
and rescue." 
  The Korean ship, which had been fishing illegally in 
Argentine waters, was sunk by its own crew after failing to 
answer to the Argentine ship's warnings. 
  The crew was transferred to the Chin Chuan Hsing, which was 
sailing nearby and approached to rescue the crew of the sinking 
ship. 
  The Navy reported that around 15 nautical miles off the 
coast 
of Malvinas and "in accordance with bilateral agreements with 
Great Britain, the Spiro transferred assistance responsibility 
to British authorities." 
  The Foreign Ministry said "an understanding with the UK for 
operations in cases of uninterrupted persecution of illegally 
fishing ships was implemented." 
  The Foreign Ministry also said the policy "is in accordance 
with the growing international opinion currently giving priority 
to the preservation, regulation, and the sustainable use of 
marine live resources and the effective punishment of violators 
of national laws on the matter."

<F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Mario Brigando in Rio </F>
Gallegos] 
  [Excerpt] On 31 May, the Latin American Arbitration Court 
will close the so-called "allegations phase" involving Argentina 
and Chile, and will be in a position to issue an unappealable 
ruling before the end of the year on the final boundary in 
Laguna del Desierto, an area where slightly more than 530 square 
kilometers are under dispute. 
  It happens that, without congressional approval on both 
sides 
of the Andean mountains, the agreements signed in 1991 by 
then-Chilean President Patricio Aylwin and Argentine President 
Carlos Menem, which resolved 22 points under dispute between the 
two countries, but did not manage to untie the "Gordian knots" 
involving the lake and the Continental Glaciers, paved the way 
for international arbitration. 
  Some diplomatic researchers speculate about the inexorably 
looming shadow of an "arbitration compensation" to settle the 
disputes with Chile. The researchers interpret that there are 
conditions for the court to recognize Argentine sovereignty in 
Laguna del Desierto. Nevertheless, based on the right, following 
the 1984 agreements on the Beagle channel, to submit other areas 
under dispute to the Arbitration Court, without a right to veto 
and with unappealable rulings, the researchers note that it 
would be a miracle if Chile does not submit the Continental 
Glaciers issue to international courts. This issue has been 
bogged down in the Argentine Congress since 1991. 
  Following a Foreign Ministry request, now that the 
arbitration ruling is forthcoming, provincial authorities wisely 
chose to remain silent. Nevertheless, the experts note that 
Chile keeps the Glaciers card up its sleeve. The experts note 
that this alternative would actually allow the approval of the 
Aylwin-Menem agreements through some compensation mechanism to 
establish the "polygonal line" [not further specified] as the 
border between the two countries. Many people in this part of 
the country believe such a ruling would involve Argentina's loss 
of "the key" to the Continental Glaciers. 
  As confirmed by maps and geographic charts, the area under 
dispute was sovereign Santa Cruz (Argentina) territory between 
the 1902 arbitration and 1965. The "official history," which is 
very well known by Santa Cruz residents, particularly confirms 
this fact. 
  The 1902 arbitration had an adventurous side: Sir Thomas 
Holdrich, a British citizen appointed by His Majesty Edward VII 
to establish the borders between Argentina and Chile, buried a 
Dutch gin jug as a group of assistants looked on in surprise. 
The landmark was established at 72 degrees 47 minutes latitude 
west. Henceforth, it was established that from that point, 
called landmark 62, to the Fitz Roy Mount the border between 
Argentina and Chile would pass through the high Andean mountain 
peaks, the local water divide (lines that meet without cutting 
across rivers). [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 24 May (AE) -- A luncheon hosted by Sao 
Paulo State Federation of Industries [FIESP] leaders for U.S. 
Treasury Assistant Secretary Lawrence Summers and Finance 
Minister Rubens Ricupero has just ended. The business people 
voiced satisfaction with the support shown by Summers for the 
Brazilian stabilization program. 
  Businessman Luiz Fernando Burlan of the Sadia Company said: 
"Summers came here as a U.S. Government representative and it is 
our impression that it is truly committed to Brazil. I for one 
was surprised by the way in which he conveyed the U.S. support 
for the plan." 
  Businessman Antonio Ermirio de Moraes said: "Summers has 
demonstrated that he has confidence in the plan." 
  Most of the business people who attended the luncheon ruled 
out the possibility of an outburst of consumption in the short 
term.

<F P=106> [By Renata de Freitas] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo, 23 May (AE) -- The Brazilian Government 
is giving signs that it has revised its foreign trade policy. 
With seven months remaining before the institutionalization of 
the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), Finance Minister 
Rubens Ricupero recently defended the Brazilian role as a 
"global trader," and argued that "the regional level is less 
attractive" for the country. He said integration into the 
Southern Cone is still a priority for Itamaraty "as long as it 
promotes an open regional organization with a liberalizing 
outlook." 
  According to Denot Medeiros, the Brazilian under secretary 
for integration, Brazil has adopted "a dose of pragmatism and 
realism" in its foreign policy. He defines the various areas of 
Brazilian foreign trade policy as "concentric circles." Mercosur 
fits within the South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA), which in 
turn fits within hemispheric integration. Medeiros noted, 
however, that Brazil is "neither interested in, nor capable" of 
now joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
  Medeiros assigned the same degree of priority to both SAFTA 
and Mercosur, a position which is different from that conveyed 
by Rubens Barbosa, who was in charge of integration until late 
last year. Barbosa said "Mercosur continues to be the priority 
for Brazilian foreign trade policy" and that, despite reflecting 
a very significant idea both politically and economically, SAFTA 
should be left for the next government. "A growing priority is 
being assigned to Mercosur," Barbosa said. 
  Professor Paulo Casella, the creator of a course on economic 
integration law at Sao Paulo University, has identified the 
first signs of change in Itamaraty's policy, and criticized the 
lack of consistency. He said: "No program may be left entirely 
to political intiative because politics is extremely volatile." 
He added that there is "a risk of wasting many years of effort." 
  The revision in Brazilian foreign trade policy has taken 
place following the Uruuguay Round of the GATT talks, that is, 
since GATT approved a global trade policy. The reduction of 
import duties reduced the significance of regionalization. In 
Casella's opinion, "Mercosur is in no way a straitjacket." 
  The American Chamber of Commerce, which consists of more 
than 
800 affiliated companies, does not view NAFTA as a stumbling 
block for the Brazilian global strategy, either. "One can move 
on all fronts at the same time," argues journalist Brian 
Nicholson, who wrote an editorial commentary entitled "Today the 
World; Tomorrow NAFTA?" published recently in a bulletin of the 
Chamber. 
  Ricupero said the diversification of Brazilian foreign trade 
has been "impressive." Brazilian trade can be broken down as 
follows: 26 percent with Europe, 24 percent with Latin America, 
20 percent with the United States, and 16 percent with Japan and 
Asia. He noted that there are 200 significant export items. 
Medeiros said "the idea that multilateralism and regionalism are 
incompatible is false." He noted, however, that this is true as 
long as there is "a liberalizing regionalism."

<F P=106> [Article by Marcio Moreira Alves: "Strategy and Spying"] </F>
  [Text] The National Defense Committee of the Chamber of 
Deputies has a brilliant group of advisers, some of them former 
Armed Forces officers who took the exams to join the legislative 
branch. Thanks to this group, seminars on matters of strategic 
interest are organized every few months with the cooperation of 
centers of civilian studies. The last seminar took place this 
week, and its theme was the use of intelligence services in a 
democratic society. 
  The Center for Strategic Studies [CEE] of the Strategic 
Affairs Secretariat, which is under the Presidency of the 
Republic, is also seeking new horizons. The CEE, which is 
associated with the Nucleus for Interdisciplinary Analysis of 
Policies and Strategies [Naipe] of Sao Paulo University, 
organized the First National Meeting of Strategic Studies. It 
will take place at the former National Intelligence Service 
[SNI] school in Brasilia from 25 to 27 May. Admiral Mario Cesar 
Flores will preside over the opening ceremony. Among the 
lecturers are former chiefs of the military regime, such as 
General Carlos Meira Mattos, and intellectuals who opposed the 
military regime, such as Aspaisa Camargo, Rene Dyfuss, and 
Luciano Martins, in addition to diplomats and ministers. It will 
be a pluralist meeting of some of the people who have stood out 
in the last few years for their devotion to the study of 
Brazilian matters. 
  In commenting on the meeting, the organizers say: "In the 
last few years, it has been noticed that there are shortcomings 
in the exchange of ideas and in the interdisciplinary debates 
about methodological progress in strategic studies in Brazil. 
The CEE and Naipe therefore decided to unite and promote a 
meeting of people who are interested in studying strategic 
matters." 
  The effort to reorganize the intelligence, 
counterintelligence, and strategic analysis of the government is 
not simply a result of the dismantling of the National Security 
Council and the former SNI, which were promoted during the 
Collor administration and officially held responsible for 
embezzlement and other crimes committed by the former "service." 
It is also a result of the call for openness imposed by the 
consolidation of the democratic process. 
  Democracy and the organs that gather information and design 
strategies are not opposed to each other. All democracies have 
their services, which report to special congressional committees 
and to the president of the Republic. Their task includes the 
preservation of the territory and the economic, scientific, and 
military interests of the nation from declared or potential 
enemies, and also from friends. 
  During the Cold War, Western intelligence services got tired 
of spying on each other. Once the Cold War was over, they set 
new goals. In July 1880 [as published], then CIA Director 
William Webster said: "We want to be informed about new trends, 
national and regional resources and limitations, financial 
transactions, and technological progress. This makes us search, 
either officially or clandestinely, for the economic information 
that our politicians need to make prudent decisions and to make 
competition as fair as possible. We need to know what our 
competitors do in order to face them or reject them." CIA 
spokesman Mark Mansfield added: "In the future, our efforts will 
concentrate on three areas: economic capacity and economic 
restrictions, commercial and financial strategies, and 
technology." 
  Today, Brazil, which is a midlevel power, has nothing in the 
area of intelligence, counterintelligence, and strategy, among 
other reasons because almost no one is thinking on a long-term 
basis. Three months are long term for most politicians, while 15 
years are short term for a Japanese enterprise. The only 
exceptions are the Armed Forces and the Foreign Ministry. This 
is why these two institutions are trying to use university 
resources, which concentrate much of the knowledge that they 
need. The meeting in Brasilia is part of that effort.

  [Excerpt] Brasilia, 24 May (AE) -- The next president of 
the Republic will be elected for a four-year term and will not 
be able to seek reelection. The Constituent Congress today 
approved for the second time a constitutional amendment that 
reduces the presidential term from five to four years. Of the 
357 congressmen in attendance, 323 voted in favor of the 
amendment, 29 voted against it, and five abstained. The 
possibility of an incumbent president seeking reelection already 
had been denied during the first vote taken on the issue.

  [Text] One day after the Sole Workers Center [CUT] decided 
in its national congress that it can neither support nor aid the 
Workers Party [PT], PT presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula 
da Silva campaigned on 23 May outside factories in the Sao Paulo 
ABC region from a loudspeaker-equipped van owned by the 
CUT-affiliated metalworkers union. On 23 May, Lula, who said 
earlier he is against CUT support, stated it is up to the 
workers to decide who should use the van. In the opinion of 
electoral specialist Antonio Carlos Mendes, Lula violated 
electoral laws.

  [Text] Santiago, 23 May (EFE) -- Today, Genaro Arriagada, 
minister secretary general of the Presidency, revealed here the 
government does not believe it is the right moment to change the 
regulations by which the commanders in chief of the Armed Forces 
and Carabineros, who will remain in their post until 1997, 
cannot be replaced. 
  The minister said that "although everyone is aware that we 
believe the commanders in chief should be appointed by the 
president of the Republic, the government has now proposed to 
the country what we call an `explicit defense' policy." 
  Arriagada explained that the policy "does not emphasize the 
relationship between civilians and military, but rather issues 
pertaining to national defense." 
  The fact that the high military commands cannot be replaced 
is established in the 1980 Constitution, which was drafted under 
the military regime headed by General Augusto Pinochet. 
  The minister admitted that the political parties of the 
governing coalition lack the support in the Senate, as well as 
in the Chamber of Deputies, to approve the constitutional reform 
announced in President Eduardo Frei's government program when he 
was elected in December. 
  Minister Arriagada was asked about the subject in view of 
the 
fact that President Frei did not mention it in his 21 May speech 
to Congress, in which he announced the tasks his government will 
undertake next.

<F P=106> [Report by Darcy Quinn from the "24 Hours" newscast -- </F>
passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] The conflict between the Constitutionality Court and 
President Gaviria has intensified. On the evening of 23 May, the 
president of the court disclosed a letter suggesting the dangers 
of a presidential dictatorship. Darcy Quinn has this report: 
  [Quinn] Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango began 
his 
reply to President Gaviria by reminding him of certain basic 
provisions contained in the Constitution. 
  [Arango] "The Constitution recognizes the separation of 
state 
branches --namely, the legislative, executive, and judicial 
branches -- under Article 103." 
  He also told the president that he has overlooked one very 
important point: Common citizens are permitted to do anything 
that is not specifically prohibited by law, but public servants 
must limit their actions to the duties outlined by laws and 
regulations. 
  [Arango] "With due respect for his very important office, we 
must point out that the president of the Republic is not a 
common citizen and that there are limits on his ability to 
exercise power." 
  He reminded President Gaviria that the duty of the 
Constitutional Court is to decide whether rules and regulations 
are in keeping with the Constitution. 
  [Arango] "In terms of reviewing laws, for example, this 
responsibility obviously cannot be fulfilled by Congress, which 
issues them. The chief executive cannot do this either because 
this would imply a dictatorship." 
  Finally, the Constitutional Court president outlined which 
branch of state would serve to pass judgment over members of the 
court. 
  [Arango] "If we fail to fulfill our duty, the Senate of the 
Republic is there. The Constitution states that the Senate 
should act as our judge."

Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango Mejia; date not 
given; from the "24 Hours" newscast--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Let me emphasize to you that in this case, as in any 
other, the government accepts and respects the decisions made by 
your institution with regard to the interpretation of the scope 
of the Constitution. This position, however, does not prevent me 
from advocating the alternatives I deem convenient within the 
judicial system. 
  I share with you the interest in preserving the separation 
of 
government branches, especially the autonomy of the judicial 
branch. This belief does not mean unanimity, nor does it 
obstruct the pursuit of legal or constitutional alternatives. 
  Rest assured that the government refuses to let this case be 
overblown.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 24 May 94. 
  According to a stock market report, net profits for the 
manufacturing sector rose 13.3 percent compared to the first 
quarter of 1993. The country's economic situation has not 
adversely affected Colombiana enterprises, which grew stronger 
in the first quarter, registering increases in sales and assets 
and decreasing indebtedness. The strengthening of the Colombian 
enterprises became evident in the growth of current assets and 
net worth, which rose 51.8 and 70.6 percent, respectively.

  Colombian exports to Venezuela dropped 6.5 percent as a 
result of the bolivar devaluation. (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras

<F P=106> [News conference by Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon </F>
Carpio upon arriving in Honduras to attend a meeting of Central 
American presidents, with unidentified reporters; at the Hernan 
Acosta Mejia Air Force Base in Tegucigalpa -- live] 
  [Text] [De Leon] We, the Central American presidents, are 
very excited to be here, where we will try to unify our 
positions and prepare the agenda for the hemispheric summit -- 
the so-called Summit of the Americas -- which will be held in 
the United States at the end of the year. The idea is precisely 
to unify the proposals, our proposals, proposals to be presented 
by each nation. The idea is to present in a unified manner 
diverse issues, including environmental issues, on which a 
proposal has already been drawn up by all of the Central 
American presidents. I had the honor of presenting to President 
Clinton the proposal for a sustained alliance, an Alliance for 
Sustained Development. This is a pilot program for Central 
America to strengthen our democracies based on absolute liberty, 
based on a true democracy, and based on respect for human 
rights, such as the right to a clean environment. 
  There is also the drug trafficking issue, and drug-related 
activities, which generally includes several other issues. 
There is also the free trade issue, which has taken the form of 
NAFTA. We will attempt to unify standards in an attempt to 
present a single point of view at the upcoming meeting on this. 
  [Reporter] What [words indistinct] NAFTA in Guatemala? 
  [De Leon] We have been studying this. We have presented a 
proposal to the United States. Every president has already 
appointed and designated two representatives each, and these 
representatives are already working on this. We hope this 
process will develop little by little until a hemispheric free 
trade agreement is achieved. This was the proposal the 
presidents made to President Clinton in November. Of course, to 
achieve this we must overcome several problems. Our [words 
indistinct] our goal is to achieve integration, although we 
understand that integration into this free trade agreement will 
be a slow process. 
  [Reporter] This is a historic moment for the democracies of 
Central America. The Guatemalan Government has entered into 
negotiations with the Guatemalan guerrillas. What are the 
chances these negotiations will ultimately put an end to this 
conflict, which is the last armed conflict to prevail in the 
region? 
  [De Leon] Tomorrow will be exactly one year since former 
President Serrano Elias attempted to interrupt the institutional 
and constitutional order. This is one of the main reasons why I 
assumed the presidency of the Republic. Now, one year later, we 
can highlight two fundamental changes that have taken place. 
  In institutional matters one year later, we can say with 
satisfaction that Guatemala has guarded and strengthened its 
institutionality. Today, more than ever, any possibility of 
interrupting institutional order has been removed. Now, more 
than ever, there is no talk of a coup d'etat in Guatemala, and 
the principles of institutionality have been strengthened and 
preserved and, in turn, so has the democratic process. 
  Meanwhile, when I assumed the Presidency nearly one year 
ago, 
we encountered a dialogue that had broken down; the entire 
process was totally bogged down. Now we are nearing peace 
[words indistinct] to sign peace. Today -- and this is the 
reason I was delayed -- we were engaged in direct communication 
with the Peace Commission that is discussing the displaced 
communities issue. We are on the verge of resolving this point, 
while we are [words indistinct] the aspect we have already 
agreed upon on a timetable that will conclude with a cease-fire 
in September. In certain regions, there could be cease-fires 
before this time. This would conclude with the signing of a 
peace pact that puts an end to an armed conflict -- the last 
one, as you just noted -- which has been going on for more than 
33 years. 
  [Reporter] What was the U.S. reaction to the proposal you 
presented in the name of the Central American presidents? 
  [De Leon] At that time, it was very well-received. I believe 
this is the time to test the world power that is our neighbor 
and which, to some extent, is committed to these issues not only 
because of a commitment to the nations of Central America, but 
also because of its commitments to its own population. For 
example, environmental issues as well as drug-related 
activities, adversely affect not only the Central American 
population, but they also affect the U.S. population and the 
world population. Therefore, this proposal was very 
well-received, and we hope that today we can wrap up this point 
and take it to the upcoming summit with... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Mr. President will this meeting 
serve to somehow establish a bilateral relationship with 
Honduras? 
  [De Leon] We have embarked on an excellent relationship with 
President Reina, and I believe that this is a good opportunity 
to discuss bilateral issues, even through this may be in a very 
quick manner. We will be meeting on 31 May in San Salvador, but 
there are issues we can discuss, such as the supply of 
electricity. We could offer Honduras a certain amount of 
megawatts, which would enable us, when the network is created, 
to supply a certain amount of electricity. Right now, this is a 
difficult issue for Honduras. We undoubtedly could discuss this 
and other issues, particularly in light of the excellent 
relationship all of the Central American nations currently have, 
and all presidents have, including the new presidents. 
  [Reporter] What about the travel advisory issued to U.S. 
citizens in the wake of the high level of violence and attacks 
against U.S. citizens? Has this situation improved? Why is 
this situation occurring? 
  [De Leon] As Guatemalan President and as a representative of 
the Guatemalan people and its government, I believe this was a 
very drastic decision; it was much too extreme on the part of 
the world power, the United States. In the United States 
itself, incidents such as those that have occurred in my country 
are also taking place against citizens from other nations. 
There are murders, violence, and others incidents. 
Nevertheless, although I respect it, I do not agree with this 
drastic decision. It is unjustified because, although in 
Guatemala we are currently experiencing a climate of violence 
like many other parts of the world, conditions do not exist to 
justify the travel warning [preceding two words in English]. 
Nevertheless, we are making an all-out effort to convince the 
United States that conditions do not prevail to continue with 
this warning in the hope of returning tourism to the nation. 
  [Reporter] But what is the reason for this situation? 
  [De Leon] It has been brought about by violent situations 
that have taken place in all countries of the world. There have 
been two or three cases. There were charges of trafficking in 
children, and these were untrue. Nevertheless, two or three 
U.S. citizens have been accused, as well as two or three other 
foreigners. Nevertheless, conditions do not prevail to justify 
the travel warning [preceding two words in English].

  [Text] Montevideo, 20 May (AFP-NA) -- The directors of the 
Argentine, Brazilian, and Uruguayan state banks met today in 
Montevideo to accelerate the region's financial integration 
process with an eye to establishing the future Common Market of 
the South (Mercosur). 
  Executives from the Argentine Bank of the Nation, the Bank 
of 
Brazil, and the Bank of the Uruguayan Republic participated in 
the meeting, according to officers of the Uruguayan bank. 
  The meeting had the mission of "evaluating the application 
of 
mutual cooperation agreements that will permit an effective 
financial integration of the countries that will be a part of 
Mercosur," according to a communique issued by the Uruguayan 
banking authorities. 
  "The mutual granting of lines of financial credit to promote 
the subregion's exports, actions to promote trade within 
Mercosur, and credit support for enterprises that run their 
activities from Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay" were among the 
topics that were evaluated. 
  The three Southern Cone countries and Paraguay will, as of 
1995, implement a free trade zone in which financial activities 
will be increased with a greater flow in the exchange of 
services and assets. 
  During the meeting that was held in Montevideo, with the 
absence of Paraguay, it was agreed to promote the "exchange of 
technical and normative information between the state financial 
institutions and to advance in the field of banking technology 
cooperation," according to the communique.

communities issue. We are on the verge of resolving this point, 
while we are [words indistinct] the aspect we have already 
agreed upon on a timetable that will conclude with a cease-fire 
in September. In certain regions, there could be cease-fires 
before this time. This would conclude with the signing of a 
peace pact that puts an end to an armed conflict -- the last 
one, as you just noted -- which has been going on for more than 
33 years. 
  [Reporter] What was the U.S. reaction to the proposal you 
presented in the name of the Central American presidents? 
  [De Leon] At that time, it was very well-received. I believe 
this is the time to test the world power that is our neighbor 
and which, to some extent, is committed to these issues not only 
because of a commitment to the nations of Central America, but 
also because of its commitments to its own population. For 
example, environmental issues as well as drug-related 
activities, adversely affect not only the Central American 
population, but they also affect the U.S. population and the 
world population. Therefore, this proposal was very 
well-received, and we hope that today we can wrap up this point 
and take it to the upcoming summit with... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Mr. President will this meeting 
serve to somehow establish a bilateral relationship with 
Honduras? 
  [De Leon] We have embarked on an excellent relationship with 
President Reina, and I believe that this is a good opportunity 
to discuss bilateral issues, even through this may be in a very 
quick manner. We will be meeting on 31 May in San Salvador, but 
there are issues we can discuss, such as the supply of 
electricity. We could offer Honduras a certain amount of 
megawatts, which would enable us, when the network is created, 
to supply a certain amount of electricity. Right now, this is a 
difficult issue for Honduras. We undoubtedly could discuss this 
and other issues, particularly in light of the excellent 
relationship all of the Central American nations currently have, 
and all presidents have, including the new presidents. 
  [Reporter] What about the travel advisory issued to U.S. 
citizens in the wake of the high level of violence and attacks 
against U.S. citizens? Has this situation improved? Why is 
this situation occurring? 
  [De Leon] As Guatemalan President and as a representative of 
the Guatemalan people and its government, I believe this was a 
very drastic decision; it was much too extreme on the part of 
the world power, the United States. In the United States 
itself, incidents such as those that have occurred in my country 
are also taking place against citizens from other nations. 
There are murders, violence, and others incidents. 
Nevertheless, although I respect it, I do not agree with this 
drastic decision. It is unjustified because, although in 
Guatemala we are currently experiencing a climate of violence 
like many other parts of the world, conditions do not exist to 
justify the travel warning [preceding two words in English]. 
Nevertheless, we are making an all-out effort to convince the 
United States that conditions do not prevail to continue with 
this warning in the hope of returning tourism to the nation. 
  [Reporter] But what is the reason for this situation? 
  [De Leon] It has been brought about by violent situations 
that have taken place in all countries of the world. There have 
been two or three cases. There were charges of trafficking in 
children, and these were untrue. Nevertheless, two or three 
U.S. citizens have been accused, as well as two or three other 
foreigners. Nevertheless, conditions do not prevail to justify 
the travel warning [preceding two words in English].

  [Text] Montevideo, 20 May (AFP-NA) -- The directors of the 
Argentine, Brazilian, and Uruguayan state banks met today in 
Montevideo to accelerate the region's financial integration 
process with an eye to establishing the future Common Market of 
the South (Mercosur). 
  Executives from the Argentine Bank of the Nation, the Bank 
of 
Brazil, and the Bank of the Uruguayan Republic participated in 
the meeting, according to officers of the Uruguayan bank. 
  The meeting had the mission of "evaluating the application 
of 
mutual cooperation agreements that will permit an effective 
financial integration of the countries that will be a part of 
Mercosur," according to a communique issued by the Uruguayan 
banking authorities. 
  "The mutual granting of lines of financial credit to promote 
the subregion's exports, actions to promote trade within 
Mercosur, and credit support for enterprises that run their 
activities from Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay" were among the 
topics that were evaluated. 
  The three Southern Cone countries and Paraguay will, as of 
1995, implement a free trade zone in which financial activities 
will be increased with a greater flow in the exchange of 
services and assets. 
  During the meeting that was held in Montevideo, with the 
absence of Paraguay, it was agreed to promote the "exchange of 
technical and normative information between the state financial 
institutions and to advance in the field of banking technology 
cooperation," according to the communique.

<F P=106> [News conference by U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, </F>
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, Costa Rican President 
Jose Maria Figueres, and Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon 
Carpio with unidentified reporters following Gore's meeting with 
Central American presidents at the Government Palace in 
Tegucigalpa; Gore speaks in English with passage by passage 
translation into Spanish; transcribed from the English -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Reina] It is a great pleasure and honor to be 
here today in the presence of the Central American presidents 
and U.S. Vice President Albert Gore. This is happening in 
Tegucigalpa a few hours before we mark Journalists Day. Thus, I 
think that this is a symbolic act. I wish to congratulate you 
for this celebration that speaks highly of communications in our 
homeland. 
  We had a very interesting meeting which was enriched by the 
opinions of the U.S. Vice President, who has had a very 
brilliant career in his country, in the House of 
Representatives, the Senate, and in politics. The vice 
president wanted us to discuss very important issues, including 
sustainable development and good government [previous two words 
in English], which I call social revolution in Honduras; in 
other words, a government that makes scrupulous efforts to 
become not only efficient but absolutely honest in the handling 
of funds and in its social policies; a government that 
strengthens the principles of democracy and consolidates those 
values to achieve development with a humanistic consideration, 
which is what we have talked about in the past. 
  Vice President Gore will address you, and afterward, you may 
pose appropriate questions, and the vice president, I, or the 
presidents of Central America will answer them. We are honored 
to have here the presidents of Central America, which has grown 
because we now include Panama and Belize as countries of the 
region. Thank you very much for being here. Mr. Vice 
President, welcome to Honduras; this is the press from my 
country. [previous sentence in English] [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Is there a possibility that the U.S. Government 
could get international organizations to be more flexible toward 
the Central American countries? Have you made a commitment in 
this summit to talk to these international organizations to be 
more flexible and to decrease their pressures against these 
countries when it comes to the negotiation of loans? 
  [Gore] [words indistinct] intensive discussion of the need 
for development on a sustainable basis in the region with 
assistance from multilateral development banks and other 
international financial institutions and increased investment 
flows and trade flows to improve standards of living throughout 
Central America, and in the bilateral meetings I had with 
President Reina prior to the meeting with all of the Central 
American presidents, we talked in specific detail about the 
relationship between Honduras and the IMF and ways in which the 
United States can offer constructive help in that dialogue. 
  [Reporter] Mr. U.S. Vice President, President Endara 
announced today that the first withdrawal of U.S. troops from 
the Canal Zone will take place next week. Our question is: Will 
your country seek to negotiate with Honduras or any other 
Central America country the relocation of the bases, which the 
Panamanians say they want vacated by 1999? 
  [Gore] Perhaps, that is the reason why it was not part of 
the agenda for a discussion. 
  [Reporter] Is the United States willing to accept 
responsibility for its conduct during the past decade? What 
specific commitments will the United States assume in light of 
appalling poverty in Central America so that economic 
readjustment programs can be made more flexible and sustainable 
development can be achieved from a humane viewpoint in the short 
run. Also, what commitments will it make to give the area, 
currently represented as a bloc, the same conditions offered to 
other countries, for instance, within the frameworks of NAFTA 
and the Summit of the Americas to be held in Miami? 
  [Gore] We want to be a good partner with the countries of 
Central America. We believe that what we have stood for, not 
only during the last 10 years but the last 200 years, is in the 
best interest of all people. We believe in democracy and free 
markets and social justice, sustainable development, human 
rights, and the other values that are now shared and are almost 
universal in this hemisphere. The Summit of the Americas in 
December promises to be an unparalleled opportunity for the 
democracies of this hemisphere, having reached this plateau of 
development and shared values, to now set our sights together on 
even higher peaks and to find more effective ways to work 
together to improve standards of living for all of our people in 
the areas of education, health care, environmental protection, 
and sustainable economic development throughout the hemisphere. 
My country wants to be a good partner in all these endeavors. 
I was really impressed by the depth of the dialogue that we 
shared during this consultative meeting in Tegucigalpa. I think 
this was an important milestone. 
  [Reporter] The fight to protect the environment begins to 
emerge in the Central American countries. As the governments say 
they are willing to protect the environment, they are often 
cornered by a lack of resources and resort to foreign 
investment. For instance, in Honduras, the government is 
preparing to approve a considerable amount to install a refinery 
in a protected area. Would the U.S. Government be willing to 
help Hondurans protect the environment and, to what extent, will 
it be willing to help? 
  [Reina] No decision has been made regarding that refinery 
yet. There is a proposal, which must be studied with the 
environmentalist groups. No commitment exists yet to establish 
that refinery. This is why we cannot ask for help because a 
decision has not been made. Hondurans will be the ones to decide 
whether this is convenient or not. I have said this in order to 
clarify the situation for Vice President Gore. 
  [Gore] I do not know any region in the world where seven 
heads of state have come together to propose that an entire 
region, across international boundaries, be considered a model 
area for sustainable development with careful attention to 
protecting the environment and the natural resources, the 
bio-diversity, and the harmonious relationship between people 
and the environment. We have agreed to enter into an intensive 
consultative process, to put flesh on those bones, so to speak, 
to spell out the specifics of what such a commitment would mean. 
As for resources necessary to support an approach like this, 
the Inter-American Development Bank has now set aside a rather 
large sum that will help efforts to protect the environment and 
to promote sustainable development. Other international 
financial institutions are also setting environmental criteria 
for providing support for sustainable development, institutions 
like the World Bank, for example. I believe Central America has 
an opportunity to be a showcase at the December Summit of the 
Americas as a success-story in how nations can cooperate and 
improve the lives of their peoples by pursuing sustainable 
development. Now, one final comment: It is essential also to 
focus on stabilizing population. There are 30 million people in 
Central America today, within 25 years, there will be 50 million 
people. In September, the entire world will gather in Cairo for 
a global conference on stabilizing population. Part of 
sustainable development is finding ways to take the steps 
necessary to stabilize population: increasing child-survival 
rates, providing education for all people and [break in 
reception] women. 
  In some areas of the world that is one of the, [pauses] the 
lack of education is part of the problem. Providing access to 
birth control and information about birth control. These are 
measures which will be discussed in Cairo in September. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Reporter] Let us now listen to President Jose Maria 
Figueres. 
  [Figueres] We are trying to set up a new axis around which 
to 
create a new relationship between the United States and the 
Central American countries. The truth of the matter is that 
relations between our countries and the United States during the 
1980s had a lot to do with the armed conflicts that were going 
on in the region. Today, we are seeking a new basis upon which 
to build a good and beneficial long lasting relationship. 
  [Reporter] Could you tell us why the meeting was extended? 
Did any of you ask the United States to intercede with 
international financial organizations to try to make conditions 
on our foreign debt payment a little more flexible? 
  [Figueres] I understand that President Reina discussed the 
matter with Vice President Gore during a meeting prior to the 
meeting with all the presidents. We did not discuss this issue 
during our meeting, however. It is very related to the issue of 
sustainable development. We discussed the Central American Bank 
and agreed this financial institution of ours could become a 
source of financial assistance to facilitate the transition to 
sustainable development. To do that, we would have to attract 
capital to the Central American Bank from countries outside the 
region. 
  [Reporter] We also have statements by Guatemalan President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio. 
  [De Leon] We need resources. Although he did announce that 
local and international nongovernmental organizations are going 
to talk with him and us, we made our request for cooperation 
quite clear. We highlighted the fact that the international 
community tends not to help us as much in Latin America, Central 
America in particular, as we emerge from under development or as 
we overcome our institutional and democratic problems and look 
toward improving development and fighting poverty. There are 
several examples of this. We were clear to state that we must 
continue receiving the same degree of cooperation if we want to 
reach sustainable development levels. 
  Regarding the issue of trade and investment within an 
environment of sustainable development, we pointed out three 
specific areas: 1) the need to accelerate and support the 
process of prior negotiations directed at signing agreements 
under an alliance for a program of sustainable development, 2) 
the need to designate a technical liaison for Central America 
and for the U.S. Government to coordinate and prepare the 
process, and 3) to direct our foreign ministries to set a date 
for the next follow-up meeting in Washington. As you may 
remember, we presented a pilot plan for Central America when we 
were in Washington, which will now be a central issue for this 
meeting. The Central American countries will present this plan 
together, with the intention of receiving technology and 
resources. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, specifically now, what kind of 
action can the U.S. Vice President carry out, or what degree of 
influence could he have to channel funds toward Central American 
countries? 
  [De Leon] One issue we discussed has to do with trade. 
Today, the vice president himself announced what we were going 
to request of him: trade equality. He announced today that the 
Clinton administration has responded and has proposed, or is 
about to propose, trade parity for our countries before 
Congress. This equality would grant preferential treatment for 
certain products, such as textiles and others. This is, in 
itself, a preliminary step toward entering NAFTA, whose final 
objective is to become a hemispheric trade agreement. We also 
asked him to invite the U.S. Government to become an external 
partner of the Central American Bank of Economic Integration 
[BCIE] 
  [Reporter] What did he say? 
  [De Leon] He gave us a very specific answer; he will examine 
this request under the light of the Clinton administration's 
economic position. We hope they will answer us at the next 
meeting in the United States. This is, as you can see, a very 
specific answer to the request for funds you mentioned. With 
the United States and the vice president integrated as external 
partners of the BCIE, we would obviously have better access to 
funds from the United States. Hence, their commitment goes 
further than meetings and conferences to become an effective 
contribution. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, we would like to know if the vice 
president made any commitment about preventing what is known as 
Central American forum flu [trancazo de los foros 
centroamericanos] and if it is in fact avoidable? I mean unfair 
economic packages. 
  [De Leon] That was not something we discussed directly. It 
is, however, a situation that affects all Latin American 
economies. We hope the human aspect, the social aspect... [6 
second break in reception] ...certain areas could see 
significant development levels, but with a social and human 
outlook. That will not only mean growth for a chosen few, but 
the effective fight against poverty. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, you have shown your willingness 
to accept all that he has promised here, but, what chances do we 
have that this will be complied with? 
  [There is no answer; a voice is heard saying: Over here, 
please] 
  [Reporter] Security agents have intervened and did not 
permit 
any further questions. The men did not even allow the 
Guatemalan president to answer the question. 
  [Announcer] The news conference is over. In addition to U.S. 
Vice President Gore and the Honduran president, the presidents 
of Costa Rica and Guatemala participated and spoke in detail on 
the subjects discussed during this joint meeting of the Central 
American presidents and the U.S. Vice President.

<F P=106> [By Francisco Ramirez Cardenas] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 24 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Cuban 
Government suspended summer vacations for sugar workers after 
announcing that the harvest season will be extended and asked 
workers to keep working "until the last cane is pressed" to 
avoid losses in the sector resulting from the heavy rains. 
  "These are the times in which our intelligence, our work 
ethic, and courage are necessary to produce as much sugar as 
possible," Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres Perez said on 
Tuesday in statements to official newspaper GRANMA. Torres 
asked agro-industrial workers to raise their spirits and not to 
give up in view of the heavy rains and floods, which paralyzed 
harvests in the eastern provinces of the island, where at least 
10 persons lost their lives. 
  Bridges, roads, thermoelectric plants, houses, and 
plantations were adversely affected by the heavy rains, which 
represented for the residents of the region a disaster similar 
to the one they suffered last November. 
  The sugarcane harvest, which had been scheduled to end in 
April, was first extended until May, and now, according to 
official estimates, could be extended until June. 
  The critical situation was foreseen in mid-April by Vice 
President Carlos Lage, who in an analysis meeting in Holguin 
Province described the sugarcane harvest situation as tense and 
difficult. Lage, the principal economic strategist, thereby 
changed the criteria he had set at the beginning of the year 
when he said that the 1994-95 harvest season would be greater 
than the present one and that the present one would be greater 
"by several hundred tons [as received] than the 1992-93 season." 
  The water excess, in addition to obstructing the work of the 
scarce machinery that remains operating with the shortage of 
fuel, decreases the amount of sucrose in the sugarcane. Cuba 
registered in the last sugar cane harvest, its principal 
industry, the lowest production in three decades of only 4.2 
million tons of sugar, which President Fidel Castro described as 
"a disaster." 
  The drop in production, as compared to the 1991-92 harvest 
season, of 7 million tons, represented for the island a decrease 
in revenue of $500 million at a time when the country is facing 
a serious shortage of foreign exchange. "In July and August, 
nothing will stop...most of the sugar cane workers will remain 
in combat because there are no resources to perform work in 
other areas, including repair work" at the sugar mills, Torres 
said. "This effort we are making is not due to somebody's whim 
or to the proud search for an objective," the sugar industry 
minister said in the western city of Matanzas. 
  The rains of the last 30 days in the Provinces of 
Guantanamo, 
Granma, Holguin, and Santiago de Cuba flooded hundreds of 
hectares and paralyzed the sugarcane harvest, which is also 
facing problems due to the lack of supplies. 
  Torres suggested taking advantage of the momentary absence 
of 
rain to work in the flooded fields because "we cannot spare even 
a ton of sugar. The national economy and the commitments we 
have made require it." 
  The Cuban Government has, for the past few weeks, made a 
dramatic effort, which included the deployment of thousands of 
workers with machetes -- cane cutters -- to step up production.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Begin Constant recording] 
FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of 
Haiti] has askws the Clinton administration to remove the ships 
operating off the Haitian coast because of the country's 
volatile situation, and to avoid all defensive reaction from the 
population. 
  FRAPH commands all its supporters to closely cooperate with 
the Haitian Armed Forces during this period of hostility created 
by the threat of intervention: We are saying: Grenadiers to the 
assault. It is not important who dies. FRAPH says it hopes 
President Clinton and the United Nations realize that the crisis 
is political, not military. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Furthermore, FRAPH denounces the new demands the 
United Nations is making of the military. The organization led 
by Emmannuel Constant states that the Governors Island agreement 
does not provide, at any point, for the departure of the police 
chief in Port-au-Prince nor of members of the Army General 
Staff, but in its most recent stand, the United Nations Security 
Council mentions the resignation of members of the General 
Staff. Moreover, Constant demands the withdrawal of the military 
from the negotiation file. The country now has a president in 
Justice Jonassaint, maintains Emmannuel Constant. FRAPH favors 
the professionalization of the Army and the separation of the 
police and the Army. FRAPH calls on the government of Justice 
Jonassaint to make reforms in public administration and to 
prosecute President Aristide and resigning Prime Minister Robert 
Malval. 
  [Begin Constant recording] FRAPH asks the executive to give 
the necessary orders for the examining office to issues 
summonses for the following citizens: Aristide, deposed 
president of the Republic of Haiti; Prime Minister Malval; 
Ambassador Jean Casimir; Attorney Michael Barnes, for 
embezzlement -- see Mr. Malval's letter of 14 December 1994. 
  FRAPH solicits help for the Haitian state and the Haitian 
justice system from the Armed Forces and the forces of order in 
retrieving some of the administrative files that were taken by 
ministers of the Aristide/Malval government. As agreed, FRAPH 
hopes that the Ministry of Commerce will succeed in reducing the 
prices of essential products by 40 percent. Bravo. [applause] 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] FRAPH also criticizes the international civilian 
mission, which it accuses of writing subjective reports. FRAPH 
asks the observers to stop their investigation on the human 
rights situation in Haiti. FRAPH claims it is center-right and 
denounces the extreme right in Haiti, which it calls 
opportunistic and without political vision.

  [Text] La Paz, 13 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Deputy Ramiro 
Barrenechea, of the Pachacuti Axis Movement, has said that the 
supreme decree authorizing the industrialization of coca leaves 
is further evidence of the government's inopportune actions, as 
it breaks all existing laws by penalizing the use of this 
product. 
  He added critically that "this decree proves that the only 
thing the government wanted in the negotiations (with the COB 
[Bolivian Labor Federation]) was to delay the resolution of this 
central problem. It is a deliberate lie, because when the 
lifting of the highway blockade was conditioned on the issuance 
of the decree, it was said that the text of the decree would be 
the one that was drawn up with the peasants, who honestly and 
loyally lifted the blockade. The peasants believed the 
government's word, but the government has now done exactly the 
opposite." 
  He added that this decree penalizes coca leaves and goes far 
beyond Law 1008, because while this law made no provisions on 
the subject, such provisions have now been made. We can see 
that the agreement that was reached with the peasants was 
ignored, based on a decision by the U.S. Embassy which said that 
it would not permit implementation of a different policy for 
coca, and this is what we are now seeing. 
  He said that "this is an unbelievable provocation, because 
the government could have said this before. Instead, it has 
deceived peasants with a decree that despite enforcing the 
regulations that were agreed upon, has also penalized coca." 
  To justify his assertion, Barrenechea mentioned Article 2 of 
the decree, which reads: "The regulations approved by this 
decree apply to legal coca, and do not entail the legalization 
of coca. Specific quantities of coca leaves should be 
industrialized in the traditional zones that are described in 
Article 9 of Law 1008." 
  The government should have been more sincere, and should 
have 
said that it did not need to debate with peasants, as there is 
an order that must be fulfilled no matter the agreements we may 
have reached, Barrenechea said. 
  He added: "This decree will probably cause a wave of 
unbridled reactions by peasants, because maintaining that a 
government position can be negotiated is very different from 
accepting a proposal, finding consensus on it, and then doing 
exactly the opposite. It is like a hidden dagger carried by 
those who are not sure even of their own program."

<F P=106> [State of the nation address by President Eduardo Frei </F>
Ruiz-Tagle at the opening of the 1994 congressional period in 
Valparaiso -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [monitored in progress] ...and has been built 
during our democratic life. I have come to this Congress with 
an open and confident spirit. I am not unfamiliar with 
Congress. I came from it. I know its virtues and limitations. 
The presidential system of government believes Congress is a 
place for real encounter and cooperation. Great Chilean 
congressmen have contributed under that political system. 
[passage omitted] 
  What is the basic idea this president wants to convey to 
this 
sovereign assembly at the beginning of his administration? 
  I have come to assert that Chile has a great historic 
opportunity. I have come to invite the country to take this 
opportunity. I have come to explain how the government hopes to 
take advantage of this opportunity in the immediate and near 
future. Taking an opportunity means recognizing it. Our great 
writers and historians have taught us that Chile had other 
opportunities in the past. One of them is very well known 
because when it was not taken, it meant a long history of 
national frustrations. 
  The people feel great bitterness when they lose their 
opportunity and have to wait for a long time for a new one. An 
opportunity is not a miracle as a result of a plan or the magic 
or force of a political boss. An opportunity is the result of 
work by all the people which sometimes does not come true 
because of disagreements among their leaders or because the size 
of the projects is not up to the circumstances. This is when 
the sacrifice of the people can become useless and forgotten. 
  I am deeply convinced that a powerful series of national and 
international factors have opened a great opportunity for us. 
Chile has grown over the past 10 years at an average rate of 
over 6 percent a year, which is unusual in the history of Chile. 
During this period, our exports increased at a rate of over 9 
percent, inflation decreased from an average 20 percent per year 
in the second half of the 1980's to an average 13 percent during 
the last two years. These achievements were made along with a 
historic reduction of unemployment, which dropped from an 
average of over 17 percent in the last decade to about 5 percent 
in the last few years. 
  Our great hope in the future, however, lies in increasing 
our 
savings and investments. During recent decades, the savings 
rate never surpassed 18 percent of the GDP, in the last few 
years it has risen to about 22 percent. In the last couple of 
years, the investment rate, which traditionally never reached 20 
percent, has risen to between 25 and 27 percent. This is 
unprecedented in the last 50 years of Chilean economic history. 
  This economic growth will be accompanied by a greater social 
determination through a decrease in poverty levels and an 
increase in production. This was the start of an era in which 
we have achieved economic growth with equity. If we are able to 
maintain this trend in the next 10 years, our country will 
certainly have reached the threshold to overcome 
underdevelopment. 
  World transformations have opened new horizons for our 
expectations of economic growth and a new political, cultural 
and social agenda. The internationalization of the economy is a 
reality today. We face the challenge of exporting all goods and 
services with comparative advantages to all countries throughout 
the world. Soon there will come a time when our traditional 
economy will probably continue to grow and, at the same time, we 
will perfect the current comparative advantages and thus achieve 
proper margins of competitiveness of new goods and services. 
  The new post-Cold War international agenda is ambivalent. On 
the one hand, the conflict that characterized the second half of 
this century -- which during peak political tensions 
internationalized intrinsically local issues as we Chileans know 
too well -- is categorically over. On the other hand, we are 
simultaneously witnessing the opening of new expectations of 
altruism with new threats of barbarism. 
  The end of bipolarity has done away with rigid dogmas that 
characterized our recent past and allows for a wider, more 
diversified, and richer discussion of the options available at 
all social levels. The globalization of communications and an 
increasing interaction, however, challenge our identity. We 
need to critically assimilate the global culture that surrounds 
us through our own development. 
  If our social, political, and economic coexistence become 
cosmopolitan without an adequate hierarchical order, our 
Republic runs the risk of becoming a true Tower of Babel. To 
assume this historic opportunity, we must prioritize subjects, 
objectives, and challenges; and thus center our country's energy 
on the needs of our people. This should be achieved by 
concentrating our efforts in those areas which have a greater 
impact on the quality of life of all Chileans. 
  We have defined three great tasks that must be assumed with 
a patriotic attitude because beyond being the specific duties of 
the administration in power, the future of all Chileans depends 
on these national objectives. They are: the consolidation of 
our economic development, eradication of extreme poverty, and 
establishment of a modern labor code; the design of effective 
and all-encompassing health and education systems able to meet 
the demands of a fast-growing society; and lastly, the insertion 
of Chile into the international scenario. 
  In the last few years, Chile has conquered a privileged 
position among countries with developing economies. This 
constitutes a solid basis upon which to build the country all 
Chileans desire. We are determined to continue to build and 
expand this path toward development on the basis of equity and 
stability. The success achieved in the recent past compels us 
to redouble our efforts in the immediate future. 
  This year, we experienced an economic adjustment process 
that 
will result in an economic growth of about four percent and an 
estimated inflation rate of 11 percent. Today's sacrifices, 
however, are an investment for the future. We will be 
inflexible in our struggle to curb inflation because it 
constitutes the worst tax to burden those fellow citizens who 
live off a salary or wage. 
  This is a high priority task for my administration. In the 
past few months, we have already adopted measures to decrease 
high spending. We will not curb the inflation rate by resorting 
to the easy alternative of decreasing the exchange rate because 
it will undermine our exports. 
  There will be no economic growth without effort and 
sacrifice. We will achieve a greater economic growth only if we 
are able to significantly increase our national investments and 
savings. This compels us to be more austere both at the private 
and public levels by avoiding spending, which many times is 
justified, and thus increase our savings and finance investments. 
  Continued high economic growth demands constant efforts to 
strengthen savings and investments and their effectiveness is 
strongly tied to development and the expansion of the financial 
market. We are committed to implementing the new capital 
markets law promptly. We hope to achieve a reasonable and 
timely solution to the debt of private banks with the Central 
Bank through the adoption of responsible measures that will not 
undermine the Central Bank's patrimony. 
  The government, which will persevere in its efforts, will 
use 
the savings and investment fiscal policy, the commercial policy, 
and production incentives, as tools to achieve the following 
goals: 1) To curb inflation so that during my administration we 
may achieve single-digit inflation comparable to that of 
successful economies; 2) a real economic growth of no less than 
5.5 percent during my administration so that by the year 1999 we 
may increase the current per capita income of $3,160 to about 
$4,400. This represents a 38 percent increase at today's 
current values; 3) a more dynamic job market to increase the job 
and labor force by 2.5 percent per year; 4) a production 
increase that will average about 3 percent per year. Although 
this is demanding, it will allow economic growth on a more 
equitable basis; 5) a gradual but systematic increase of real 
salary levels to substantially increase the real salary of 
workers during my administration; 6) a significant increase in 
consumption levels of low-income families in line with the new 
sustainable opportunity pattern [patron de oportunidades 
sustentables] which is designed for them; 7) a continuation 
of our commercial opening process by expediting the 
internationalization process of the financial and investment 
fields to considerably increase our competitive levels. [passage 
omitted] 
  Throughout history, Chilean foreign policy has always 
abided by the following main principles: Firm respect for 
international law, the peaceful solution of conflicts, 
international cooperation, support for democracy, and friendly 
relations among all nations. 
  Within the current international context, compliance with 
these principles is evinced by the active and dynamic support 
given to the internationalization of Chile's economy through 
what we call diplomacy for development. 
  With this encouraging attitude in mind, we have defined 
three 
main targets for our country's foreign policy. First, we will 
seek to further internationalize the Chilean economy through 
alliances and agreements which will give us a better chance of 
becoming part of an increasingly interconnected world. Our 
second objective is to improve our relations with our main trade 
partners throughout the world, while fostering an atmosphere 
conducive to the strengthening of democratic stability, 
especially in Latin America. Our third objective will be to 
selectively participate in initiatives to attain peace, foster 
democracy, increase respect for human rights, and implement 
development and social fairness throughout the world. 
  We will act in keeping with certain guidelines and policies. 
Our country fully supports the principle of open regionalism 
and believes that regional agreements are the appropriate 
mechanism to expand trade and investments. We believe these 
agreements should ultimately seek increasingly free world trade. 
This approach allows us to unilaterally open our economy, sign 
bilateral agreement, and actively participate in multilateral 
negotiations. 
  Our foreign policy will give priority to our ties with other 
Latin American countries. Latin America has again become one of 
the world's most economically dynamic areas. Economic 
integration and complementariness are, thus, more necessary than 
ever. We would like to contribute to the shoring up of an 
atmosphere of peace, dialogue and mutual trust among the 
countries of this region. With this objective in mind, we will 
implement a policy based on constructive rapprochement, and 
physical and economic integration. This year, we expect the 
court of arbitration will issue a ruling that will end the 
dispute [with Argentina] over Laguna del Desierto, thus reducing 
pending border disputes to the minimum. 
  Our evaluation of the results of bilateral agreements Chile 
has signed so far with Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, and 
Venezuela, is very positive. These agreements and our domestic 
policies that seek to further open our economy have contributed 
to make more dynamic our commercial relations with other Latin 
American countries. We will continue to negotiate with Ecuador, 
and we hope that our talks with Peru and Brazil will make more 
headway than they have so far. 
  We are especially interested in our relations with the 
Common 
Market of the South [Mercosur] to which Chile's two main Latin 
American trade partners belong. In the coming months, Chile 
will propose to Mercosur a mechanism which, without requiring us 
to become a partner in that common market, will pave the way for 
the establishment of a free trade zone in the region. 
  We are aware that in the medium term, it will become 
necessary to find a regional framework to reconcile the many 
partial agreements that various countries have reached among 
themselves. The Latin American Integration Association [ALADI] 
should provide us with the proper legal foundation for an 
integration policy, and provide the main scenario for 
multilateral action to the point of becoming a true Latin 
American trade forum. 
  Chile will support efforts to make the Rio Group the common 
representative for Latin America at global debates. This group 
must expand its economic scope, especially to join forces 
against protectionist measures which threaten our development. 
The Rio Group must resume its initial quest for political 
agreements to tackle pending problems related to peace, security 
and coexistence in Latin America. 
  Our Latin American policy must be fully compatible with our 
drive for greater participation in world markets. My 
administration will give priority attention to the negotiation 
of bilateral or multilateral agreements aimed at the attainment 
of this objective. 
  We want to broaden our bilateral agenda with the northern 
countries. With the U.S. Government, we recently made the 
political decision to begin negotiating a free trade agreement 
which could be either bilateral or multilateral by having Chile 
join NAFTA. My administration views negotiations for this kind 
of agreement as a priority. 
  This does not mean just any agreement will be attractive to 
us. It is very important to coordinate negotiations and properly 
weigh the impact of the various elements such as the opening of 
the goods and services market, trade regulations, mechanisms to 
resolve disputes, intellectual property, investments, 
environment, labor affairs, and other issues that an agreement 
of this kind involves. Only through a joint effort by the entire 
country will the negotiations have a positive outcome for Chile, 
and pave the road for other Latin American countries. 
  Europe is also an important target for our foreign policy. 
The EU is the world's largest common market, and continues to 
be one of Chile's main commercial partners. Furthermore, our 
country has excellent political relations with the European 
countries. These relations are based on deep-rooted common 
values and this has prompted a significant flow of cooperation 
and investment. We have things in common that we want to 
develop and thus strengthen commercial ties with the EU and its 
members and to soften the impact of protectionist tendencies 
that harm Chile. We are prepared to negotiate -- either 
bilaterally or multilaterally through the Rio Group -- a 
partnership with Europe that will give stability to our 
commercial and financial operations. 
  Chile's foreign policy also seeks to increase the opening 
toward the Asian-Pacific countries. The Pacific Basin is bound 
to be one of the main scenarios of the future world. In October 
this year, we will join the Asia Pacific Cooperation, APEC, thus 
crowning our efforts to tighten bonds with that part of the 
world. Our presence in the Asian-Pacific region is, however, 
not strong enough yet. The Chilean Government can create 
favorable conditions and establish the necessary contacts, but 
it is up to private entrepreneurs to make use of these 
facilities daringly and creatively if we truly want to make 
Chile Latin America's outlet to the Pacific. [passage omitted] 
  The protection of the environment and natural resources is 
yet another priority of my administration. Our work to protect 
the environment will abide not only by the provisions of the 
Constitution and of the Basic Law for the Environment; we will 
also take several other steps. The state will be given 
effective legal, economic, and administrative tools to include 
protection of the environment in the policies for each sector. 
For this the administration will strengthen the National 
Environment Commission [Conama] and the appropriate regional 
commissions. 
  This year we will develop and implement the rules and 
regulations for the evaluation of the environment, which the 
Basic Law for the Environment calls for, and the regulations 
that will allow us to set environmental standards. We will 
improve the people's environmental awareness through formal and 
informal education methods aimed at fostering 
environment-conscious behavior patterns. For this, we will 
train over 1,200 monitors over the next three years. 
  The administration will promote environmentally sustainable 
technological development. Along those lines, we are already 
implementing a program of subsidies for technological upgrading 
aimed at reducing by 60 or 70 percent the consumption of 
industrial components that harm the ozone layer by the year 1996. 
  We also want to develop consultative mechanisms for the 
citizenry and the productive sectors concerning the drafting of 
environmental policies and instruments. The administration is 
already in touch with these sectors in its effort to create the 
above mechanisms. This effort will be strengthened soon through 
the establishment of a communications center under the Conama 
umbrella, and by involving social agents in the adjustment and 
implementation in Chile of the Rio-21 environmental agenda. 
  We will actively involve public agencies that have a role 
to play in the preservation of the environment in solving 
administrative problems and in training and the allocation of 
resources. To accomplish this, we have the invaluable support of 
a World Bank program which is already operational. 
  We will implement a program to control water and air 
contamination, for which the appropriate standards will be 
established. The administration will also encourage financial 
companies to support worthwhile environmental projects. For 
this, the administration will expedite technological upgrades 
and allow the companies to comply with regulations by providing 
the lines of credit to finance the necessary investments. 
  We will support the environmental efforts of the 
municipalities for which instructions have been issued to 
develop the necessary instruments for better and more effective 
management of urban, industrial, and dangerous waste. We will 
also strive for a more effective use of energy. As part of our 
planning of the use of energy, and in keeping with our 
international commitments, we have prepared a list of gases 
related to the greenhouse effect. We will also improve the 
national wildlife reserve system, coastal zoning, and marine 
reserves. [passage omitted] 
  The future of our nation is safeguarded by a nonpartisan, 
coherent national defense policy designed in consensus by 
democratic institutions. No particular problem will deflect us 
from these guidelines. In matters of national defense, the 
administration will assume its pertinent role of strategic and 
political leadership. To this effect, it will strengthen and 
streamline the existing defense institutions. It will promote 
the adequate modernization of our Armed Forces by granting them 
a stable budget based on strategic criteria, and by assuming the 
challenge of reorganizing them in keeping with the demands of 
the international and regional scenarios. 
  We want all citizens to be aware of the privileges and 
duties 
that the task of national defense entails. We will actively 
promote the involvement of civilians, at the academic and 
technical level, in the development of the Armed Forces and in 
national defense matters. The administration will promote this 
national awareness through a National Defense Report to be 
issued in one year. This report, which will be available to all 
citizens, will explain in detail the objectives and tools of our 
national defense. 
  My administration has decided to fully occupy Chilean soil, 
sea, and air spaces. We will consolidate and integrate our 
domestic borders and will effectively occupy our lands. To this 
effect we will study the initiative that the Chilean Army has 
promoted in this regard within the vast concept of the 
regionalization and national development programs. 
  Moreover, when I opened the Month of the Sea, I proposed a 
series of initiatives for the development of a sea policy. In 
addition, the Navy has made important contributions to 
developing sea resources, which constitutes a new privileged 
space for development opportunities. 
  We need an organization to promote these initiatives and to 
coordinate the activities of those organizations dealing with 
sea-related activities. In view of this, within a six-month 
period, the government will establish a National Oceanic 
Commission that will be in charge of overseeing the effective 
occupation of the sea, the safeguarding of Chilean rights, and 
the balanced exploitation of sea resources. 
  The administration is also closely following the vast 
prospects for the peaceful exploitation of space: 
communications, weather forecasting, and environment. In view 
of this, it will study the Chilean Air Force's proposal to 
create a national space institute. 
  Our challenges in the defense area will be based on the 
pillars of knowledge to promote the commitment of citizens and a 
national defense policy for a safe future. [passage omitted] 
  There will be no sustainable development for our fatherland 
if we are unable to establish well-designed and effective 
political institutions that are recognized by all as just and 
legitimate. There are countries with successful economies that 
have been ruined by faults in their political systems. There 
have also been countries with truly legitimate political systems 
that have seen their development frustrated because of the 
explosion of longstanding social conflicts, or because of their 
inability to draft a coherent security and defense policy. 
  My administration has proposed that the constitutional 
reform 
be discussed within the broader framework of the state reform 
and modernization program in order to adjust it to international 
changes at the economic, international affairs, and political 
levels. This is not a question of minorities or majorities or 
an issue concerning the imposition of the will of one group over 
that of the other. By definition and essence, this is an issue 
of consensus. 
  I want to be perfectly clear on this issue. I propose, 
therefore, a frank, open, and constructive proposal. I believe 
everyone must admit that there are a large number of issues in 
the current constitutional order that lack consensus. No matter 
on which side of the fence you are standing -- among those who 
defend the current constitutional order or those who criticize 
it -- we must admit that this constitutional order lacks the 
consensus it should and needs to have. 
  There is a lot of contradictory criticism in Chile about the 
electoral system, the municipal order, the manner in which 
mayors are elected, the limits and procedure for controlling 
legislative elections, or how the Senate is formed. Moreover, a 
series of proposals and initiatives are circulating on 
inabilities and incompatibilities in regional council reforms. 
  It is neither practical nor ethical for our country to 
exhaust these issues in rigid political struggles without 
implementing this reform. On this basis I urge you to adopt a 
futuristic outlook, one of rapprochement through dialogue, and 
one that seeks constructive solutions in congress and in the 
political parties' debates. 
  Let us overcome stagnation because this only helps to 
aggravate problems. Let us not use this issue to point out the 
differences between government and opposition parties. Let us 
not adopt a narrow-minded attitude by only proposing reforms 
based on either government or opposition power strategies. Let 
us not center our discussions on ideological issues or try to 
seek personal attention. If we avoid these temptations, we will 
be able to have a constructive debate instead of one that will 
increase our differences. 
  More specifically, more than centering our discussions on 
authoritarian enclaves to safeguard democracy, we must face the 
challenge of defining what kind of congress we need for Chile; 
and of establishing a municipal order that heeds the current 
national needs, seeking democracy at the municipal level, 
decentralization, efficient administration, and ethicality. 
  Within this context, my administration is working on two 
constitutional reform bills which we will soon submit to 
Congress. The first is inspired by the idea of having an 
expeditious and modern congress with truly democratically 
elected members. 
  In view of this, we will be proposing reforms in the 
following areas. First, the reform of the electoral system, 
establishing one that will guarantee reasonable results based on 
the principle of one citizen, one vote, and reflecting the 
representativity of main opinion trends, contributing to 
political stability and long-term governability. 
  We are also open to reforms that will increase the 
effectiveness of legislative work, expedite paper proceedings, 
and make less bureaucratic the drafting of bills. 
  In this regard, the government proposes to do away with the 
differences between ordinary and extraordinary congressional 
terms. Moreover, it proposes reforms seeking to make joint 
committees more efficient and expedite proceedings in the 
drafting of laws. We are willing to introduce reforms to the 
Constitution that will increase the supervisory duties of the 
Chamber of Deputies. 
  A modern congress must offer guarantees to congressional 
minority blocs so that they can exercise their supervisory 
duties in an effective and responsible manner. This 
presupposes, under terms to be specified, a decrease in the 
number of legislators needed for the establishment of 
investigating committees [applause], but it also guarantees the 
responsible exercise of supervisory duties so that no one 
shielded by legislative immunity may undermine the honor and 
dignity of people without being punished. [applause] 
  A constitutional reform, like the one we aspire to implement 
in Congress, cannot exclude the case of designated senators. 
The proposal of this amendment does not presuppose an adverse 
judgement against the persons who are today exercising these 
duties. My administration is convinced that the Senate must be 
formed on the basis of the will of the people. [applause] 
  The second constitutional reform draft bill to which we are 
devoted is that concerning municipal government. This 
administration is willing to discuss an amendment that will 
allow the direct election of mayors. The approval of this 
reform compels us to carry out an exhaustive discussion of the 
overall modernization of the municipal administration system, 
which presupposes the study of several interrelated issues. 
  Let us consolidate our institutions on the basis of national 
objectives. We need coherent and overall democratic operational 
objectives at the regional and municipal levels. Let us keep in 
mind that what is at stake here is the competence and the 
essential resources needed to achieve an equitable balance 
between the municipalities and regions of our country. 
  There is another issue I would like to comment on, which 
affects the quality of politics, the administration of the 
state, and our entire society. I am referring to ethics and 
morality. 
  Chile is a country with an honorable tradition of public 
service. We must safeguard and protect this moral patrimony. 
Though they are of course serious, the recent reports of 
irregularities and abnormalities cannot compel us to say that we 
are facing a situation of systematic or rampant corruption. 
  Nonetheless, we must be prudent and safeguard our fatherland 
with a view to the future. We also cannot ignore that drug 
trafficking and other illegal transactions are dangers that are 
looming over our fatherland. 
  In view of this my administration is determined to increase 
the quality of life of our citizens by reasserting the moral 
values that are essential for public servants; by improving the 
social control of government leaders; and by increasing openness 
in the exercise of political duties and in the interrelation 
between political and economic power through a more effective 
handling of public assets and institutions. 
  The lack of public ethics is the result of an uncontrolled 
exercise of power, and ambiguous responsibilities. In view of 
this we must define responsibilities, and what is legal and 
illegal in public life. This is a consensus that must be 
achieved with the ultimate objective of restoring a new national 
public ethics code. 
  The promotion of morality presupposes the achievement of a 
national consensus because public ethics affect private business 
and public administration alike. In view of this, we have 
promoted and established the National Public Ethics Committee, 
encompassing all the branches of government and representatives 
of civilian society. Its objective is to draft guidelines 
which, once introduced through administrative and legislative 
measures, will be clear guidelines for preventing and punishing 
behavior that is not in keeping with ethics and morality. We 
will have specific results in this regard within a couple of 
months. 
  We will continue to work relentlessly, but calmly and 
diligently, in the same manner in which we have written the 
history of our nation. 
  My government will comply with its duty in this area. By 
the end of this millennium, we either will or will not have 
taken full advantage of the historic opportunity we have 
received from the nation, with the unprecedented circumstances 
existing in the world today. 
  One of the most common ways of undermining the strength and 
drive of the national plan is by hiding behind group interests. 
The relative situation of neglect affecting any given group, 
within the context of various production and service sectors, 
will be corrected only through a persevering, effective, and 
coherent policy. There is no other way of reversing the 
historical process that provoked the weakening of that sector. 
  Each Chilean must be aware of what this new opportunity is 
all about. We must find ways to stop opportunists, hasty 
populists, and those who are still longing for polarization and 
violence. Each Chilean should know that political stability is 
an essential condition for economic growth. Everyone, 
especially the lower income sectors, must know the extent to 
which social development is dependent on economic growth. The 
poorer, humbler people can still tell between those who seek 
progress and those who only instigate useless disputes. 
  Ending an era in which ideologies prevailed cannot generate 
a 
void entailing a lack of ideologies or ideas. Drawing on the 
nation's spiritual strength, we must build a common democratic 
foundation. This foundation, which ought to be based on 
ethical-legal principles, must promote a culture upholding 
responsibility. This foundation should be taught in schools, 
families, and through the media, as well as in churches and in 
other national spiritual centers, so that it may be legally 
binding for everyone. 
  The country must reaffirm its resolve to act with the 
strength of its old pioneers. The country requires new efforts 
and new tasks, without which the national plan will lose 
strength. Civic friendship and a conciliatory spirit are the 
driving forces behind this new opportunity. The desire to 
search for agreements has been one of our major achievements in 
our coexistence in recent years. This desire may thus not be 
conceived as a mere truce, or as a ruse to block the action of 
the opposition. To search for agreements is to promote 
understanding rather than confrontation; it means to understand 
that development requires stability; it entails awareness that 
politics is built on confidence, which gives way to constructive 
behavior. It means to understand that no agreement will bring 
adverse effects on those who promoted it, but that it will 
rather bring legitimacy and glory upon those who promoted it. 
[applause] 
  In this spirit I urge everyone to look, without pause, for 
basic agreements concerning the rules of the political and 
economic games and broad cooperation among the branches of 
government. Let us be aware of this opportunity. We have the 
chance to humanize politics. Let us all make sure that our 
legitimate democratic disagreements stay on a suitable course. 
We have made much progress, but let us not fail at such a 
decisive moment for our economic expansion and political 
consolidation. [passage omitted] 
  The nation must display sound, calm optimism in order to 
continue treading this historic path. By the end of the next 
decade, the resolve of each Chilean will have made a great 
nation from this small community. [passage omitted] 
  Seventy days ago I solemnly pledged here to respect the 
Constitution and the laws, and to work for the greatness of the 
fatherland. Today, complying with the desire of our people, 
without arrogance, with happy humbleness, with resolve, courage, 
and strength, I am committed to leading our country on the path 
leading to this great opportunity. May God enlighten me in this 
great task. Long live Chile! [applause]

<F P=106> [News conference by U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, </F>
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, Costa Rican President 
Jose Maria Figueres, and Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon 
Carpio with unidentified reporters following Gore's meeting with 
Central American presidents at the Government Palace in 
Tegucigalpa; Gore speaks in English with passage by passage 
translation into Spanish; transcribed from the English -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Reina] It is a great pleasure and honor to be 
here today in the presence of the Central American presidents 
and U.S. Vice President Albert Gore. This is happening in 
Tegucigalpa a few hours before we mark Journalists Day. Thus, I 
think that this is a symbolic act. I wish to congratulate you 
for this celebration that speaks highly of communications in our 
homeland. 
  We had a very interesting meeting which was enriched by the 
opinions of the U.S. Vice President, who has had a very 
brilliant career in his country, in the House of 
Representatives, the Senate, and in politics. The vice 
president wanted us to discuss very important issues, including 
sustainable development and good government [previous two words 
in English], which I call social revolution in Honduras; in 
other words, a government that makes scrupulous efforts to 
become not only efficient but absolutely honest in the handling 
of funds and in its social policies; a government that 
strengthens the principles of democracy and consolidates those 
values to achieve development with a humanistic consideration, 
which is what we have talked about in the past. 
  Vice President Gore will address you, and afterward, you may 
pose appropriate questions, and the vice president, I, or the 
presidents of Central America will answer them. We are honored 
to have here the presidents of Central America, which has grown 
because we now include Panama and Belize as countries of the 
region. Thank you very much for being here. Mr. Vice 
President, welcome to Honduras; this is the press from my 
country. [previous sentence in English] [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Is there a possibility that the U.S. Government 
could get international organizations to be more flexible toward 
the Central American countries? Have you made a commitment in 
this summit to talk to these international organizations to be 
more flexible and to decrease their pressures against these 
countries when it comes to the negotiation of loans? 
  [Gore] [words indistinct] intensive discussion of the need 
for development on a sustainable basis in the region with 
assistance from multilateral development banks and other 
international financial institutions and increased investment 
flows and trade flows to improve standards of living throughout 
Central America, and in the bilateral meetings I had with 
President Reina prior to the meeting with all of the Central 
American presidents, we talked in specific detail about the 
relationship between Honduras and the IMF and ways in which the 
United States can offer constructive help in that dialogue. 
  [Reporter] Mr. U.S. Vice President, President Endara 
announced today that the first withdrawal of U.S. troops from 
the Canal Zone will take place next week. Our question is: Will 
your country seek to negotiate with Honduras or any other 
Central America country the relocation of the bases, which the 
Panamanians say they want vacated by 1999? 
  [Gore] Perhaps, that is the reason why it was not part of 
the agenda for a discussion. 
  [Reporter] Is the United States willing to accept 
responsibility for its conduct during the past decade? What 
specific commitments will the United States assume in light of 
appalling poverty in Central America so that economic 
readjustment programs can be made more flexible and sustainable 
development can be achieved from a humane viewpoint in the short 
run. Also, what commitments will it make to give the area, 
currently represented as a bloc, the same conditions offered to 
other countries, for instance, within the frameworks of NAFTA 
and the Summit of the Americas to be held in Miami? 
  [Gore] We want to be a good partner with the countries of 
Central America. We believe that what we have stood for, not 
only during the last 10 years but the last 200 years, is in the 
best interest of all people. We believe in democracy and free 
markets and social justice, sustainable development, human 
rights, and the other values that are now shared and are almost 
universal in this hemisphere. The Summit of the Americas in 
December promises to be an unparalleled opportunity for the 
democracies of this hemisphere, having reached this plateau of 
development and shared values, to now set our sights together on 
even higher peaks and to find more effective ways to work 
together to improve standards of living for all of our people in 
the areas of education, health care, environmental protection, 
and sustainable economic development throughout the hemisphere. 
My country wants to be a good partner in all these endeavors. 
I was really impressed by the depth of the dialogue that we 
shared during this consultative meeting in Tegucigalpa. I think 
this was an important milestone. 
  [Reporter] The fight to protect the environment begins to 
emerge in the Central American countries. As the governments say 
they are willing to protect the environment, they are often 
cornered by a lack of resources and resort to foreign 
investment. For instance, in Honduras, the government is 
preparing to approve a considerable amount to install a refinery 
in a protected area. Would the U.S. Government be willing to 
help Hondurans protect the environment and, to what extent, will 
it be willing to help? 
  [Reina] No decision has been made regarding that refinery 
yet. There is a proposal, which must be studied with the 
environmentalist groups. No commitment exists yet to establish 
that refinery. This is why we cannot ask for help because a 
decision has not been made. Hondurans will be the ones to decide 
whether this is convenient or not. I have said this in order to 
clarify the situation for Vice President Gore. 
  [Gore] I do not know any region in the world where seven 
heads of state have come together to propose that an entire 
region, across international boundaries, be considered a model 
area for sustainable development with careful attention to 
protecting the environment and the natural resources, the 
bio-diversity, and the harmonious relationship between people 
and the environment. We have agreed to enter into an intensive 
consultative process, to put flesh on those bones, so to speak, 
to spell out the specifics of what such a commitment would mean. 
As for resources necessary to support an approach like this, 
the Inter-American Development Bank has now set aside a rather 
large sum that will help efforts to protect the environment and 
to promote sustainable development. Other international 
financial institutions are also setting environmental criteria 
for providing support for sustainable development, institutions 
like the World Bank, for example. I believe Central America has 
an opportunity to be a showcase at the December Summit of the 
Americas as a success-story in how nations can cooperate and 
improve the lives of their peoples by pursuing sustainable 
development. Now, one final comment: It is essential also to 
focus on stabilizing population. There are 30 million people in 
Central America today, within 25 years, there will be 50 million 
people. In September, the entire world will gather in Cairo for 
a global conference on stabilizing population. Part of 
sustainable development is finding ways to take the steps 
necessary to stabilize population: increasing child-survival 
rates, providing education for all people and [break in 
reception] women. 
  In some areas of the world that is one of the, [pauses] the 
lack of education is part of the problem. Providing access to 
birth control and information about birth control. These are 
measures which will be discussed in Cairo in September. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Reporter] Let us now listen to President Jose Maria 
Figueres. 
  [Figueres] We are trying to set up a new axis around which 
to 
create a new relationship between the United States and the 
Central American countries. The truth of the matter is that 
relations between our countries and the United States during the 
1980s had a lot to do with the armed conflicts that were going 
on in the region. Today, we are seeking a new basis upon which 
to build a good and beneficial long lasting relationship. 
  [Reporter] Could you tell us why the meeting was extended? 
Did any of you ask the United States to intercede with 
international financial organizations to try to make conditions 
on our foreign debt payment a little more flexible? 
  [Figueres] I understand that President Reina discussed the 
matter with Vice President Gore during a meeting prior to the 
meeting with all the presidents. We did not discuss this issue 
during our meeting, however. It is very related to the issue of 
sustainable development. We discussed the Central American Bank 
and agreed this financial institution of ours could become a 
source of financial assistance to facilitate the transition to 
sustainable development. To do that, we would have to attract 
capital to the Central American Bank from countries outside the 
region. 
  [Reporter] We also have statements by Guatemalan President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio. 
  [De Leon] We need resources. Although he did announce that 
local and international nongovernmental organizations are going 
to talk with him and us, we made our request for cooperation 
quite clear. We highlighted the fact that the international 
community tends not to help us as much in Latin America, Central 
America in particular, as we emerge from under development or as 
we overcome our institutional and democratic problems and look 
toward improving development and fighting poverty. There are 
several examples of this. We were clear to state that we must 
continue receiving the same degree of cooperation if we want to 
reach sustainable development levels. 
  Regarding the issue of trade and investment within an 
environment of sustainable development, we pointed out three 
specific areas: 1) the need to accelerate and support the 
process of prior negotiations directed at signing agreements 
under an alliance for a program of sustainable development, 2) 
the need to designate a technical liaison for Central America 
and for the U.S. Government to coordinate and prepare the 
process, and 3) to direct our foreign ministries to set a date 
for the next follow-up meeting in Washington. As you may 
remember, we presented a pilot plan for Central America when we 
were in Washington, which will now be a central issue for this 
meeting. The Central American countries will present this plan 
together, with the intention of receiving technology and 
resources. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, specifically now, what kind of 
action can the U.S. Vice President carry out, or what degree of 
influence could he have to channel funds toward Central American 
countries? 
  [De Leon] One issue we discussed has to do with trade. 
Today, the vice president himself announced what we were going 
to request of him: trade equality. He announced today that the 
Clinton administration has responded and has proposed, or is 
about to propose, trade parity for our countries before 
Congress. This equality would grant preferential treatment for 
certain products, such as textiles and others. This is, in 
itself, a preliminary step toward entering NAFTA, whose final 
objective is to become a hemispheric trade agreement. We also 
asked him to invite the U.S. Government to become an external 
partner of the Central American Bank of Economic Integration 
[BCIE] 
  [Reporter] What did he say? 
  [De Leon] He gave us a very specific answer; he will examine 
this request under the light of the Clinton administration's 
economic position. We hope they will answer us at the next 
meeting in the United States. This is, as you can see, a very 
specific answer to the request for funds you mentioned. With 
the United States and the vice president integrated as external 
partners of the BCIE, we would obviously have better access to 
funds from the United States. Hence, their commitment goes 
further than meetings and conferences to become an effective 
contribution. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, we would like to know if the vice 
president made any commitment about preventing what is known as 
Central American forum flu [trancazo de los foros 
centroamericanos] and if it is in fact avoidable? I mean unfair 
economic packages. 
  [De Leon] That was not something we discussed directly. It 
is, however, a situation that affects all Latin American 
economies. We hope the human aspect, the social aspect... [6 
second break in reception] ...certain areas could see 
significant development levels, but with a social and human 
outlook. That will not only mean growth for a chosen few, but 
the effective fight against poverty. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, you have shown your willingness 
to accept all that he has promised here, but, what chances do we 
have that this will be complied with? 
  [There is no answer; a voice is heard saying: Over here, 
please] 
  [Reporter] Security agents have intervened and did not 
permit 
any further questions. The men did not even allow the 
Guatemalan president to answer the question. 
  [Announcer] The news conference is over. In addition to U.S. 
Vice President Gore and the Honduran president, the presidents 
of Costa Rica and Guatemala participated and spoke in detail on 
the subjects discussed during this joint meeting of the Central 
American presidents and the U.S. Vice President.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 24 May (AFP) -- Manuel Garcia 
Lizardo, president of the Central Electoral Board (JCE), today 
categorically denied that the thought of a runoff election was 
being considered because "the people have already voted." 
Garcia Lizardo thereby denied statements to the contrary, which 
were attributed to him by some news media. 
  Noting that the vote count will begin on Wednesday [25 May], 
Garcia Lizardo said: "The people have already voted. What is 
left to be done is assessing the people's vote." 
  In addition, JCE spokesmen recalled that the law does not 
call for an annulment of the elections or a runoff election. 
According to the law, the only action that could be taken would 
be holding partial or complementary elections in places where 
there were serious irregularities. 
  Presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez called for 
a 
runoff election after alleging that a "scandalous fraud" was 
committed in the 16 May elections. 
  The JCE has not proclaimed a winner yet. However, following 
the count of 98 percent of the votes, President Joaquin Balaguer 
was ahead of Pena Gomez by 1.01 percent.

  [Text] Guy Alexandre [Haitian ambassador to the Dominican 
Republic] has firmly denied rumors that there is a plan to unite 
Haiti with the Dominican Republic. This alleged plan to reunify 
the two countries sharing the island of Hispaniola was strongly 
rumored last week by the partisans of outgoing Dominican 
President Joaquin Balaguer. 
  In a statement to the press this week, Ambassador Alexandre 
said he knows nothing about this alleged unification plan. In 
the middle of the grave post-electoral crisis being experienced 
by the Dominican Republic today, the pro-Balaguer sectors have 
set up an impressive campaign to highlight the dangers that 
would threaten the Spanish-speaking part in the event of a 
possible reunification. Alexandre noted the cultural and 
linguistic difference between the two peoples. 
  Nearly half a million Haitians, considered the poorest 
people 
in the American hemisphere, are living in the Dominican Republic 
where they work in the sugarcane fields and live in field 
buildings. Alexandre adds that he is satisfied because the 
Balaguer government took effective measures last October to 
prevent violation of the UN embargo against Haiti, which was 
reinforced on 21 May. 
  A UN mission, presided over by (Alexandre Martinovic), 
arrived in the Dominican Republic the middle of last week to 
ensure that the embargo, which some people use to amuse 
themselves by violating the Haitian-Dominican border, was 
observed. Observers accused several Dominican Army members of 
effectively contributing to the violation of the sanctions by 
authorizing the free transfer of oil products across the border. 
  These last months, several hundred Dominicans have made 
exceptional profits by trading gasoline to Haitians, in exchange 
for household items, slippers, and so on. The Dominicans are 
closely observing events that threaten Haiti -- whether there 
will be a foreign military intervention in that country. The 
Dominican Army is extra watchful to prevent any violation of the 
embargo and a massive exodus of Haitians to the Dominican 
Republic, said an official source.

  [Text] On 23 May, Haiti's main neo-Duvalierist group 
Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, 
FRAPH, called on its militants to mobilize and oppose by arms 
any attempted U.S. invasion of Haiti. Emmanuel Constant, 
secretary general of this party, said during a news conference 
that in case of a U.S. invasion, FRAPH would automatically 
become the Haitian People's Armed Revolutionary Front [Front 
Revolutionnaire Arme du Peuple Haitien]. 
  Condemning any and all invasion plans, Constant explained 
that FRAPH militants would fight invaders with machetes, sticks, 
and stones [if need be]. Claiming to draw its inspiration from 
the center-right but not from the extreme-right, which is made 
up of rich and heartless people, Constant asked the government 
of Provisional President Emile Jonassaint -- which is not 
recognized by the international community -- to practice true, 
non-demagogic social justice. 
  Constant also pointed out that UN Security Council 
Resolution 
No. 917, which imposes a total embargo on the country, calls for 
the resignation of Police chief Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Michel 
Francois, while the Governors Island agreement and the 
parliamentary plan for solving the crisis provided only for his 
transfer within the Army. Let us listen to Emmanuel Constant. 
  [Begin Constant recording] In spite of the gestures of good 
will made by all sectors in Haiti, including the political, 
people's, military, civilian, professional, and private sectors 
-- and the parliamentarians surpassed themselves -- the cartel 
made up of Aristide, Barnes, Casimir, and the Black Caucus wants 
to keep killing people by imposing a genocidal embargo on Haiti 
as of 21 May. The government of the president of the Republic, 
attorney Emile Jonassaint, must be able to restore order and 
discipline immediately so that social justice can reign in 
Haiti. His ministers -- regardless of whether or not they have 
experience -- should immediately effect administrative and 
judicial reforms and set up an emergency program aimed at 
helping the population, in view of this genocidal Resolution No. 
917 of the UN Security Council. [end recording] 
  But this is not all. FRAPH's organization secretary made 
proposals to the Haitian Army. Let us listen. 
  [Begin Constant recording] FRAPH wishes the Haitian Armed 
Forces not to receive any foreign or local mediators, because 
the Army is a branch of the executive and cannot negotiate with 
itself. FRAPH wishes the military to work toward the 
professionalization of the Army and the improvement of the 
working and living conditions of Haitian soldiers, and to 
withdraw completely from this negotiation dossier. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Some candidates for a clandestine trip were arrested 
in Petit-Goave. Fifty Haitians, who were getting ready to embark 
by boat to the Florida coast, were arrested by police. Those 
people, mostly peasants, were brought before the court over the 
weekend. 
  Members of the civilian mission went to the spot to 
investigate this matter. It should be noted that this was the 
first significant arrest of potential boat people since 
provisional President Justice Emile Jonassaint's announcemnt of 
his government's intention to suppress the departures of boat 
people. Orders were given to representatives of the Haitian 
justice system to apply the 17 November 1980 decree, punishing 
authors and accomplices of efforts to organize clandestine trips 
to foreign countries. 
  A clear upsurge in departures of Haitian boat people to the 
Florida coast was observed during the past few weeks, following 
the announcement by U.S. President Bill Clinton of a change in 
the procedure of direct repatriation of Haitian refugees. They 
must be authorized to seek political asylum in the United 
States, on some U.S. ships, or in some other countries. These 
new measures have not gone into effect yet, however.

  [Text] The [word indistinct] sector in St. Kitts-Nevis has 
received a boost, with the establishment of a new lending 
institution on the island. We get the details from (Via 
Gallaway): 
  [Begin recording] [(Gallaway)] The prime minister, the right 
Honorable Dr. Kennedy Simmonds, while delivering an address of 
the opening of the new branch of the Royal Bank of Canada said 
that the commerical banks in St. Kitts and Nevis play an 
important role in the overall developmental thrust through the 
wide array of banking and financial services they provide. He 
commended the Royal Bank of Canada for the confidence it has 
placed in the continued growth of the economy, adding that it 
has helped to provide a variety of modern conveniences. He also 
attributed to the solid performance of the economy over the past 
decade and our strong infrastructure base on the policies of his 
government. 
  [Simmonds] All of these entities have been effected from the 
very liberal [word indistinct] regime and the [words indistinct] 
investment climate that my government has created through 
variety of creative fiscal and economic policies. In fact, my 
government is now providing new incentives for companies to 
undertake developments of this nature. Hence, the 1994 budget 
provides that companies may now enjoy capital allowances in 
respect of new commercial buildings, the construction of which 
commence on or after matched across 1994. Hence, as I said 
[words indistinct] company limited and other companies continue 
to invest and expand, we will enjoy additional tax relief. 
  [(Gallaway)] Meantime, the vice president for the Barbados 
and Eastern Caribbean area, Mr. Douglas Maloney, said that the 
reason for the establishment of the bank was trade. The Royal 
Bank of Canada had begun life as the Merchants Bank of Halifax. 
At the turn of the century, the merchants found many 
opportunities in a [word indistinct] trade financing between 
Canada's maritime provinces and the Caribbean. He said at the 
time, sugar, cotton, and spices were being traded and the Royal 
Bank was kept busy providing banking services to importers and 
exporters on all of the islands. Governor of the Eastern 
Caribbean Central Bank, Mr. (Dwight Brenner), said a great deal 
of concern is being expressed about impact of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, on our economies. He disclosed that 
in the OECS [Organization of Eastern Caribbean States], you have 
to be very careful to continue to maintain a rational approach 
in matters of this kind and not succumb to the [word indistinct] 
"Join at all Costs" imperative, which Mr. Brenner noted seems to 
be the case elsewhere in the region. 
  [(Brenner)] In a situation where some countries are claiming 
to be NAFTA eligible, we in the OECS have to remember two 
things: firstly, that in the new atmosphere of trade and 
financial liberalization, [words indistinct] national economy, 
countries must prepare themselves to be internationally 
competitive, whether there is a NAFTA or there is not. Secondly, 
a competitive environment is based on getting the economic 
fundamentals right. And in this area, the OECS countries have 
done remarkably well for countries of their size. 
  [(Gallaway)] The new branch of the Royal Bank of Canada is 
located at the [word indistinct] Complex on Wellington Road. I 
am (Via Gallaway) reporting for the Caribbean Evening News.

Rodriguez Martinez asserted that he is impressed by Italian 
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, to whom Rodriguez presented his 
credentials on 23 May. Rodriguez told journalists that Scalfaro 
turned out to be very much aware of the problems of Cuba and 
Latin America. 
  Rodriguez replaces Javier Ardizones, who was Cuba's 
ambassador to Italy for 10 years. Rodriguez added that among his 
goals are that of maintaining and further developing the already 
good political, economic, and trade relations with Italy and 
that of spreading the truth about Cuba. 
  Rodriguez was very much interested in getting to know the 
new 
Italian Government, which defines itself as centrist, and he 
reiterated that he is very pleased to have met with Scalfaro.

    [Editorial Report] Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision 
Networks in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 25 May carry a report on the 
damage caused by recent rains in the eastern provinces. 
  In Santiago de Cuba, the Provincial Defense Council reported 
the following damage caused by ``unusually heavy'' rains and 
flooding: over 4,000 homes damaged, 72 of which were completely 
destroyed; close to 800 km of roads destroyed, with numerous 
mudslides reported in different areas; 562 power outages 
reported, and parts of the city of Santiago de Cuba left without 
power; and approximately 100 caballerias of miscellaneous crops 
damaged. 
  In Guantanamo, it has not rained for 36 hours. Juan Carlos 
Robinson, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in the 
province, has stressed the importance of working together to 
overcome the damage. The main damage in Guantanamo occurred in 
the infrastructure. This resulted in the interruption of 
heavy-vehicle traffic between Baracoa and Maisi. Many homes, 
roads, and water lines were damaged in Yateras Municipality, 
where more than 500 ml of rain were fell. So far, the number of 
lives lost is seven. Most of the people evacuated have already 
returned home. Close to 1,000 people remain in shelters and 
1,600 homes have been reported damaged; of these, 27 were 
completely destroyed.

  [Text] The Army General Staff has held a summit. 
High-ranking Armed Forces officers from units and garrisons of 
both Port-au- Prince and provincial towns gathered for a meeting 
at Army General Headquarters on 24 May. The meeting lasted 
several hours and focused on several current issues, said a 
source close to the military leadership. 
  Approximately 30 unit commanders gathered around the Army 
High Command to analyze the nation's overall situation. The 
measures taken after this meeting are unknown. Nevertheless, it 
should be recalled that the Haitian Army has been on maximum 
alert since 20 May, a few hours before the total embargo ordered 
by the United Nations against Haiti went into effect.

  [Excerpts] Several political parties have taken positions 
for or against Judge Emile Jonassaint in the provisional 
presidency of the Republic. After a week of observation, some 
political parties have begun to take positions on the 11 May 
provisional decision. Clarence Renois filed a report: 
  [Begin Renois recording] First, the socialists from National 
Congress of Democratic Movement are hoping for a quick return to 
constitutional order. The party of Professor Victor Benoit, 
minister of National Education in the resigning Robert Malval 
government, called on all Haitian democrats to express 
solidarity for the purpose of provoking a return to 
constitutional order. 
  A small party, which had supported the appointment of Judge 
Jonassaint, Pastor Vladmir Jeanty's Haitian Party of God, now 
dissociates itself from the new government. Pastor Jeanty says 
this team is not credible and has a negative profile. [passage 
omitted] 
  In opposition, Eddy Volel's party, the Christian Democratic 
Assembly, sees a dictatorship being installed in the country. 
The party's spokesman finds proof of this in the governmental 
press release, warning against any offenses to the current 
authorities. [passage omitted] 
  The MDN [Mobilization for National Development] of Professor 
Hubert de Ronceray, who had established some distance from the 
Jonassaint government even though he had previously supported 
it, is now consulting with the Jonaissant government. Between 19 
and 22 May, Professor De Ronceray met three times with three 
delegations of the provisional government. Following those 
talks, a special consulting commission was formed by the MDN. 
This commission is in charge of meeting with ministerial 
authorities and studying the policy planned by the government in 
an effort to confront the total embargo ordered by the United 
Nations against Haiti, according to a press release from the 
party. 
  Two other major parties, Nationalistic Progressive 
Revolutionary Party of Haiti, led by Serge Gilles; and Movement 
For the Establishment of Democracy in Haiti, led by former Prime 
Minister Marc Bazin, took a stand against the arrival of Emile 
Jonassaint in the provisional presidency of the Republic, 
especially denouncing the unconstitutional character of the 
provisional government. [end recording]

  [Text] The Dominican Republic has decided to respect the 
almost total embargo imposed on Haiti by the UN Security Council 
on 21 May. According to Fabio Herrera Cabral, the Dominican 
Government intends to deploy soldiers in the border areas to 
prevent leaks. Herrera added that Dominican Navy troops will be 
sent to prevent any and all Haitian initiatives to stock pile 
fuel via the sea. Haitian vessels that may try to reach the 
Dominican coasts to buy gasoline will not be authorized to pull 
into any Dominican port.

  [Excerpts] William Lacy Swing, U.S. ambassador in 
Port-au-Prince, has denounced the Emile Jonassaint government's 
intention to halt the flood of Haitian refugees leaving Haiti. 
Swing said: It is an illegal government. Its decisions will not 
be acknowledged by the international community. 
  Mr. Swing, who just returned to the country after 
consultations with his superiors, asked the Haitian military to 
take the necessary measures to ensure that citizens' rights are 
respected, while reaffirming that the establishment of democracy 
is the top priority in the case of Haiti. [passage omitted] 
  According to Ambassador Swing, the United States has pleaded 
for a marked increase in the civilian mission in Haiti in 
response to the Haitian people's expectations and to see to it 
that their rights are respected. Let us recall that according to 
what he has said, Colin Granderson, who is in charge of the 
civilian mission, intends to deploy the mission throughout the 
country in the near future.

  [Text] The antidrug brigade made a spectacular seizure of 
cocaine at the Port-au-Prince Airport by intercepting 143 kg of 
cocaine going to the United States on an American Airlines 
plane. The cocaine was being carried by two Haitians residing in 
the United States, who were arrested. Another person, a Canadian 
of Haitian origin, was apprehended with 1 kg of cocaine and 
three pounds of marijuana while he was getting ready to travel 
abroad. Clarence Renois questioned Colonel (Antoine Athouriste), 
who is in charge of the Antidrug Service. 
  [Begin recording] [(Athouriste)] [Words indistinct] only 
cocaine yesterday. It was very unusual. We have never had such a 
case at the airport before. 
  [Renois] Where did those drugs transiting through Haiti, 
that 
you fortunately succeeded in intercepting, come from, Colonel? 
  [(Athouriste)] Just like for the other Caribbean countries, 
the drug comes from Colombia. We are situated on the 
international axis for the international traffic from south to 
north -- meaning from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia to the United 
States or Europe. It is therefore necessary for the drugs to 
transit Haiti. Of course, we know that many measures have been 
taken in Haiti. We have been in control of the situation for 
many years, despite certain false allegations by certain sectors 
or the opposition, which is continuing its campaign of 
denigration. [Words indistinct] in the Caribbean, and it is done 
in Haiti as well. 
  [Renois] Could you say today, Colonel, that the antidrug 
brigade completely controls the drug-trafficking situation in 
Haiti? 
  [(Atouriste)] I tell you sincerely that to see what we have 
been able to accomplish with the support of the authorities 
concerned constitutes our greatest satisfaction. The system is 
under control and they know that. You have heard about the 
latest report of the international observers in that regard, how 
they congratulate Haiti despite the embargo. We have 
accomplished, without much money, what the Haitian Government 
was never able to accomplish in the past, before 1991. 
  [Renois] Indeed, Colonel (Athouriste), there is a report 
from 
the U.S. Justice Department that calls into question 
high-ranking Army officers, who are allegedly involved in 
protecting this trafficking from Colombia to Haiti to the United 
States. An investigation has been opened in that regard. Is the 
Haitian Army or the Antidrug Service concerned about that? 
  [(Atouriste)] Your question is quite political. We are 
technicians. I will simply say to you that the Haitian Army is 
now the dog to kill. When one wishes to kill his dog, he accuses 
it of being rabid. But we are from the Army and we have been 
fighting drugs for more than a quarter of a century in Haiti. 
The Haitian law on narcotics dates from 1971. To my knowledge, 
the Haitian Armed Forces are in charge of fighting drugs and 
continue to do so. I want to believe that what you hear in the 
media today is again this sick sector of the national life that 
is continuing its campaign of denigration, or that it is this 
sector of the international community that is affected by this 
virus you know. That is my opinion on that. [end recording]

  [Text] OECS [Organization of Eastern Caribbean States] 
leaders assembled at the (Windham) Morgan Bay Resort in St. 
Lucia today for the 23d Authority meeting. At this morning's 
meeting, outgoing chairman of the Authority, Montserrat's Chief 
Minister Reuben Meade handed over the reins to the new chairman, 
St. Lucia's prime minister, Right Honorable John Compton. 
  The meeting, which comes at a time when a host of issues 
plague the subregional grouping, is expected to go until Friday. 
Among the subjects expected to engage the attention of the OECS 
leaders are the grouping's position on individual entry into 
NAFTA, the controversial ruling issue, and the current banana 
negotiating contract. This subject is of particular interest to 
St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, and Dominica, the islands which 
make up the Windwards, as these are the major banana-producing 
countries in the region. Another agenda item, which some OECS 
leaders considered an exhausted one, is that of the 
privatization of Leeward Island Air Transport. 
  This morning's official session was addressed by the 
outgoing 
Authority chairman, Chief Minister Reuben Meade, and incoming 
chairman, St. Lucia's prime minister, Right Honorable John 
Compton. The 23d Authority meeting was attended by all but one 
leader of the OECS, Grenada's Prime Minister Nicholas 
Braithwaite was noticeably absent. Ill health has been advanced 
as the reason for the Grenadian leader's nonattendance.

  [Text] Weeks of campaigning characterized by sometimes 
harsh accusations and lots of promises came to an end last 
evening as Trinidadian nationals went to the polls to decide who 
they wish to represent them in the Laventille West area. The 
election results out of Trinidad and Tobago indicate that the 
People's National Movement [PNM] and the United National 
Congress have retained their seats. Commenting on the outcome, 
Prime Minister Patrick Manning expressed satisfaction with the 
way things went: 
  [Begin recording] [Manning] Over time, over the next year or 
two, as we come into a general election, and as things improve, 
as they undoubtedly will, you will see a considerable 
improvement in the position. The poll is low. There is voter 
apathy at this time because, to a large extent, we are at the 
midpoint in our five-year period of office. And again, because 
people saw no real threat to the ruling party, either in 
Laventille West or in (Cocorite River) Valley. All in all, I 
think we have done very well. I want to congratulate all parties 
in this election. Campaign elections were clean. Elections were 
incident-free except for one incident that had potential danger, 
but did not materialize, a couple days ago. If I told you that I 
was unhappy with the way things had gone, I would be less than 
honest. 
  [Unidentified reporter] One of the elements in this election 
has been the question of the low poll. There was very low 
response by the electorate, by the people who were eligible to 
vote for the Laventille West constituency. What do you see as 
accounting for this? 
  [Unidentified interviewee] Maybe a lot of them did not take 
the by-election too seriously. But I know that there are a 
number of (PNM) people who did not go out to vote today. And 
there is no indication that (PNM is not Laventille or Laventille 
is not PNM; Laventille is still very much PNM). 
  [Reporter] Right through the campaign, you would say that 
you 
were confident of victory. 
  [Inteviewee] Yes, right through, I was. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the opposition National Alliance for 
Reconstruction also commented on its defeat: 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We have been around 
to 
nearly all the polling divisions in the constituencies that took 
part in this election and it was quite obvious to me, and even 
from the reports of my election agents, that most of the people 
who came out to vote were senior people, and in some instances, 
they actually had to be helped to get into the polling station. 
It also tells me that the ruling party barely knows where its 
support is, and they go out to pull that support out, and in 
fact, they are pulling out senior people. They have not been 
able to capture the imagination of the younger voters. I think 
it should be a concern of all political parties because it means 
that the young people seem to be disillusioned with the 
political process. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Omar Carreon Abud: "Will Democracy Come To Us </F>
From the North?"] 
  [Text] Just like hundreds, perhaps thousands of times 
before, last week, prominent members of the U.S. Congress 
pressured our country to make Mexicans behave the way it suits 
them. This time, it was Democratic Congressmen David Bonior's 
and Robert Torricelli's turn. They submitted a draft resolution 
to the Foreign Affairs Committee on our country's upcoming 
elections. If approved, Bonior's and Torricelli's initiative 
would be debated and voted upon by the full House. 
  In essence, the U.S. lawmakers are proposing an invitation 
be 
extended to have "total international observance" of the Mexican 
elections and also "the establishment of autonomous electoral 
authorities at the federal, state, and local level." Before 
unveiling their proposal to journalists, Bonior and Torricelli 
were not remiss in including their venerable opinions on Mexican 
politics of the past years. All of this, according to the 
concerned U.S. politicians, so there can be genuine democracy in 
our country. 
  According to newspaper reports, a histrionic David Bonior 
said: "It is our hope that in approximately 95 days, the world 
will once again celebrate the triumph of democracy and raise its 
glass to another democratically elected president in Mexico." 
  The Mexican Embassy in Washington was the first to reject 
this clear meddling, which is unacceptable despite the fact that 
is has been often repeated. Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo 
McGregor was next to reject it. In that respect, many Mexicans 
feel accurately represented. 
  Is it necessary to have others observe us on election day? 
Who are these ethereal, almost immaterial individuals, 
uncontaminated by base economic and political interests, who 
could unquestionably decide if Mexicans elected their president, 
senators, and deputies in a democratic manner or if they cheated 
and have to play overtime, take penalties, or even repeat the 
game. Such individuals do not exist, and the U.S. lawmakers 
know this well. 
  If they insist, I am certain it is merely because they want 
to continue meddling, deciding the future of Mexicans. If the 
idea is not to impose a president because the old, deeply rooted 
Mexican nationalism will not allow it, then it is at least to 
obtain other concessions that may not be as decisive but which 
are certainly vital to their interests. The message is clear: 
If you do not agree, if you do not accept certain treaties and 
agreements, if you do not accept certain conditions for 
conducting business, I will accuse you and portray you as 
undemocratic and dictatorial. It is an intimidation tactic. 
  It is a tactic they are already using against Cuba. Robert 
Torricelli is sponsoring the latest tightening of the U.S. 
blockade against that island. Under the pretext that there is 
no democracy in that small country, Cubans are being starved to 
death. One cannot buy anything from Cuba; one cannot sell 
anything to it; and if a ship (no matter from what country) even 
docks there, it is penalized by not being allowed to dock in 
U.S. ports for six months. All of this because the interests 
defended in the Capitol are not the same as those defended in 
Cuba. 
  In fact -- and much has been said already -- democracy, the 
election of authorities based on the sovereign will of the 
people, is never and has never been anything but an excuse for 
meddling. There are countries where there is no democracy, 
where it is not even known, where the people live under 
outrageous oppression, but those governments and systems are not 
the object of the mildest censure on the part of the champions 
of democracy to whom we refer today. On the contrary, these 
lawmakers are their great allies and commercial partners. Close 
to us, in Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the world, the 
military violently toppled the democratically elected president. 
Now he must wander for years all over the United States begging 
for support. He only receives evasive remarks and promises. 
  Father away we have an example that is similar or even more 
eloquent. Saudi Arabia has been ruled for decades by a despotic 
family that does not even know what "international observers" 
are, much less "autonomous electoral observers." When the time 
came, however, it proved itself to be one of Washington's most 
unscrupulous and therefore staunchest and most reliable allies. 
We will not even mention the terrible years of Pinochet, 
Stroessner, and General Videla, among many others. 
  We Mexicans are read the riot act, but we flatly reject it. 
Decisions concerning Mexico's economic and political life and 
everything else fall solely within our purview, even more so now 
that the solidarity of the poor with the poor is only an 
illusion of the past. If our system of life has flaws, even if 
it has aberrant features, it falls to Mexicans to correct it. 
It is clear that models from abroad are not always viable and 
that pressure from abroad is never acceptable. The best and 
only way to have a fatherland that is more just, sovereign, 
free, and democratic, which is what many of us want, is through 
the unity and organization of the people who suffer abuses and 
injustices and who are always living under oppression. Heeding 
the north is not and will never be the way. They have their 
interests, not friends. We have our children to leave them a 
better, or a least a little better, world.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 24 May. 
  A Chinese mission headed by Wang Lian Ying, chairman of the 
Real Estate Development Corporation of Economic Technology 
Development of Yukou, arrived in Mexico City on 18 May. The 
purpose of this mission is to sign a final agreement for the 
start of a "Mexican Town" tourist project in China. (Mexico 
City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 19 May 94 p 18) 
  The inflation rate in 66 percent of the country's major 
cities, not including Mexico City, was greater than the 7.2 
percent registered nationwide from January to April. (Mexico 
City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 20 May 94 p 3A) 
  Figures released by the Finance and Public Credit 
Secretariat 
indicate the GDP rose 0.5 percent during the first quarter of 
1994, which is the smallest first-quarter increase within the 
past five years. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 20 May 94 p 
19) 
  Speaking in Guadalajara, Jaime Serra Puche, commerce and 
industrial development secretary, reported that Mexico has 
exported more than $4 billion to the United States since NAFTA 
went into effect, thereby setting an all-time record. 
Meanwhile, Pedro Aspe, finance and public credit secretary, 
reported that customs revenues are increasing at an annual rate 
of 5 billion new pesos. The Finance Secretariat also reported 
nonoil exports rose 15.7 percent in March from the same period a 
year earlier, while oil exports rose 23 percent. (Mexico City 
XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 21 May 94) 
  Mexican exports increased 17 percent during the first 
quarter 
of 1994 when compared to the same period a year earlier. 
Exports of manufactured goods rose 26 percent. Figures show 
Mexican imports from the United States increased 22 percent. 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 23 May 
94) 
  The Finance Secretariat has reported that, during the first 
quarter of 1994, the Mexican trade deficit hit $4.317 billion, 
with exports and imports amounting to $13.735 billion and 
$18.052 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, the Mexican GDP 
increased 0.5 percent during the same period. (Paris AFP in 
Spanish 1709 GMT 21 May 94) 
  A quarterly report issued by the National Banking and 
Insurance Commission indicates that expired portfolios amounted 
to 38.431 billion new pesos, representing a 59.8 percent 
increase, in the first quarter of 1994. The report also shows 
that loans amounted to 471.975 billion new pesos, while bank 
reserves amounted to 15.369 billion new pesos, a 46.7 percent 
increase, during the same period. Bank net profits increased 18 
percent. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 23 May 94 p 4)

  [Text] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio has said that 
the CACIF's [Coordinating Committee for Agriculture, 
Commercial, Financial and Industrial Associations] refusal to 
participate in the Civilian Society Assembly and its decision to 
meet with the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] and 
to demand the legal prosecution of guerrilla commanders are 
still puzzling me, but I respect its position because it proves 
there is freedom in the country. 
  De Leon compared peace to a train, and sectors that 
fail to hop aboard are left at the station. The CACIF has 
realized that it must join efforts to reach peace, he added. 
  As for the petition made by business circles to the Attorney 
General's Office that UNRG commanders must be legally 
prosecuted, the head of state deemed it somewhat hard to 
understand as CACIF is holding talks with the URNG. This shows 
peace is more difficult to achieve than war. I want to clarify, 
however, that I respect all decisions made by CACIF, he 
pointed out. 
  As for the talks held by conflicting parties on the uprooted 
population, the president said he has little to say because 
civilian sectors have already made their proposals and the 
delegations will make the final decision. 
  President De Leon also said he was pleased with the visit he 
paid to the refugees who returned to Guatemala in the last few 
days because he regards them as apolitical Guatemalans, although 
some leaders are trying to use or manipulate them.

<F P=106> [Paid advertisement by the General Command of the Guatemalan </F>
National Revolutionary Unity, place and date not given: "The 
Situation and Resettlement of the Population Displaced by the 
Armed Conflict"] 
  [Text] Being forced to leave one's land, place of origin, 
home, and natural and social surroundings is no doubt one of the 
most painful dramas that can happen to a person, a family, and a 
community. If violence and repression force them to seek 
survival and run for their lives in the midst of ferocious 
extermination campaigns, the scope and drama of this situation 
is then unmeasurable. 
  It is an exodus of sorrow and bitterness. It is a march 
amidst terror and huge uncertainty. It is to walk not knowing 
where, leaving everything behind, abandoning everything obtained 
through the hard work of a lifetime. The tales, testimonies, 
and descriptions of those who one day had to leave propelled by 
anxiety and harassment will never tell the whole story. They 
watched their homes burn down. They died along the way or had 
to start their lives again overwhelmed by sadness and longing 
for the past. 
  The scope of the people who were displaced by the repression 
should be carefully considered. One must recall and clearly 
state the motives behind the displacements, determine the 
consequences of these displacements, and seek solutions. In 
Guatemala, the displacement started with the scorched earth 
strategy and genocide the army carried out in large areas of the 
country during the 1980's. This policy later became 
consolidated with the repressive mechanisms of control over the 
population, the establishment of concentration camps, 
euphemistically called model towns or development centers. 
  The direct, repressive, and brutal actions against the 
civilian population is what causes the phenomenon of refugees, 
people displaced internally, or resistant communities. 
Altogether or separately, they constitute problems of a truly 
terrifying scope in terms of quantity and quality. 
  The URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] thinks 
the 
situation of the displaced population (refugees, people 
displaced internally, and resistant communities) must be viewed 
in its overall context, although we must seek specific solutions 
that at any rate and from any standpoint have a common 
denominator, and, therefore, comprise in a substantial manner 
the list of topics in this search for a political solution to 
the internal armed conflict. 
  It is totally wrong to view it as a simple problem of 
repatriation of emigrants who wish to return based on their 
legitimate right. It is also wrong to assess it for unspeakable 
reasons as an administrative or economic problem. 
  The displaced population in its various forms constitutes a 
living and visible testimony of a policy of repression and it 
includes separations, traumas, and an aftermath of historic and 
national consequences. It is a complex problem to which no 
solution can be found if it cannot be found within the framework 
of complete agreements that truly resolve the causes of the 
problem and that compensate for harm inflicted. 
  Repression and mechanisms of oppression were the causes that 
degenerated into this situation. They are the direct result of 
a demented outpouring against insurgents. It would be illusory 
or unrealistic to attempt to resolve this acute and immense 
problem with partial agreements or measures. 
  Based on the fact that this reality must be part of the 
general solution, the list of topics, and agreements between the 
government and the URNG, the following has to be taken into 
consideration: 
  1. The problem of the displaced population has to be 
considered and discussed as a whole, starting with the 
conditions and reasons that forced the different displacements 
and establishing the specific characteristics of its current 
situation. 
  2. Foremost, the solution to this problem must take into 
consideration the opinion and stance of the sectors that were 
directly hurt by it to study and design their resettlement. 
  3. Because of its nature, the situation of the displaced 
population will be partly resolved if the agreements on human 
rights adopted during the process of negotiation are fully 
implemented. Their implementation, enforcement, and verification 
is a sine qua none condition to make the problem viable. [as 
published] 
  4. The active participation of the international community 
through governments, nongovernment organizations, and 
humanitarian organizations is truly essential and a decisive 
element to guarantee their certain and effective resettlement, 
based on the needs of that population. 
  5. Considering that the essence of the problem of the 
displaced population has a social and political nature, although 
it also has very important components of an ethnic and economic 
nature, it is necessary to draft specific projects that address 
those aspects. 
  6. It is necessary to create and guarantee conditions so 
that 
the solution to the problem of refugees, people internally 
displaced, and resistant communities does not turn into a 
demagogic program indented to fracture the overall negotiation. 
  7. In the case concerning refugees in Mexican territory, the 
impartial conditions for their return have to be created. In 
addition, the elemental principles of voluntariness and specific 
guarantees of a political, economic, and social nature that they 
are defending must also be created.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz by anchorman </F>
Edgardo Melgar and journalist Mayra Navarro at network studios 
in Tegucigalpa and by Carlos Ridel at network studios in San 
Pedro Sula; from the "This Very Day" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Melgar] I am accompanied by Foreign Minister 
Ernesto Paz Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Foreign Minister, for being 
with us on "This Very Day" newscast. What is your opinion on the 
summit among Central American presidents and the U.S. Vice 
President?. 
  [Paz] I firmly believe this summit marks the beginning of a 
new relationship between Central America and the United States 
in the framework of a new phase, the post-Cold War period, with 
a new democratic leadership that will show the way for Central 
America to follow in the next few years. 
  [Melgar] Was this summit a success? 
  [Paz] It was a success. 
  [Melgar] For whom? 
  [Paz] For Central America and the United States. I think it 
represents significant support for the Honduran Government and 
for President Reina as a leader. This is an event that speaks 
for itself and responds to some foreign publications that claim 
there is no credibility or stability in Honduras. Vice 
President Gore's presence here has strengthened the regional 
leadership of President Reina. 
  [Melgar] Let us quickly review the agreements celebrated 
this 
afternoon by the presidents of Central America and Vice 
President Al Gore. Let us begin with Carlos Ridel, at the main 
studio. 
  [Ridel] Welcome, Foreign Minister Paz, for being with us. We 
understand there will be a hemispheric summit in Miami in 
November. What significance will the resolutions drafted here 
today have for the Miami summit? 
  [Paz] I think the summit scheduled to take place in December 
will allow the United States to outline its foreign policy for 
Latin America. I think it is positive for Latin America that 
the United States is outlining its policy for the next few years. 
  [Melgar] Mayra, I believe you want to ask the foreign 
minister about commercial relations. 
  [Navarro] Yes. Today, Vice President Gore announced Central 
America will be granted some benefits similar to those Mexico 
receives through NAFTA, but in exchange for some conditions. 
Perhaps you can give us more detail on these conditions and on 
how the integration will take place. 
  [Paz] Central America has reiterated its desire to join 
NAFTA. Central America has requested to be granted benefits 
similar to those Mexico receives within the framework of NAFTA. 
  In the next few months, President Clinton will present to 
the 
U.S. Congress a bill to extend the benefits of the Caribbean 
Basin Agreement. Central America will have to make efforts to 
improve the capabilities of Central American workers. It will 
have to make substantial changes to the copyright law. This is 
a demand of the United States. 
  [Melgar] Mr. Foreign Minister and listeners, I have in my 
hands a copy of the joint communique signed by the presidents of 
Central America and the U.S. Vice President. Here is a part 
that speaks of a common project involving Central America and 
the United States. The communique speaks of sustainable 
development. We have characterized it as a framework for 
creative cooperation within which we can jointly tackle priority 
objectives of common interest, such as fighting poverty and 
strengthening democracy. How will this common U.S.-Central 
American project of sustainable development be carried out? 
  [Paz] Sustainable development has to be based on a new kind 
of alliance between Central America and the United States. 
Sustainable development is a new concept that takes into 
consideration the interest this and future generations have in 
combining development and the struggle against poverty in 
harmony with nature. 
  [Ridel] Mr. Foreign Minister, excuse me for stepping out of 
the economic and social arena, but today, the presidents of 
Central America stated their solidarity with former Venezuelan 
President Carlos Andres Perez. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry 
immediately told them not to meddle in the domestic affairs of 
Venezuela. What can you tell us about this? 
  [Paz] I think the statement by the Central American 
presidents was a gesture of gratitude toward an important person 
who decisively supported Central America when it was going 
through its most difficult period in the 1980's. We think we 
should not take the feathers off a wingless bird. We Central 
Americans believe in gratitude and think this is good news for a 
man who is going through his most difficult moment and is in 
prison. 
  [Melgar] Thank you, Mr. Foreign Minister, for participating 
in this mini-news conference. Any final statement for our 
television audience? 
  [Paz] I thank "This Very Day." I am certain we have embarked 
on a new phase that will reorient U.S.-Central American 
relations based on mutual respect and common interests between 
the two regions. 
  [Melgar] Thank you, Mr. Foreign Minister.

  [Text] Sergio Ramirez Mercado, who was removed from the 
Sandinist National Directorate during the party's special 
congress, has said he will continue the struggle for deep 
changes in the Sandinist Front [FSLN], which is now controlled 
by Daniel Ortega's orthodox faction. I will continue promoting 
ideas of change, transformation, and renewal within the FSLN, 
the former Nicaraguan vice president and chief of the FSLN bloc 
in the National Assembly said. He added: These are not battles 
one wins in only one day. He also said a crisis emerges when 
something does not complete its birth and death processes. 
  He indicated that one must struggle for something new to be 
born in Sandinism. In that constant struggle, nothing is over 
[words indistinct] the day of its victory, Ramirez said. He 
said that in the National Assembly, the conservative group that 
now controls the party has already carried out the first phase 
involving crushing those who do not think like it does. He was 
undoubtedly referring to Daniel Ortega and those who currently 
hold important key positions in the FSLN. Ramirez said they will 
now implement the second phase of the plan to control the 
legislative faction, the newspaper BARRICADA, the media 
stations, and those who do not think like the new Sandinist 
leadership that emerged from the FSLN congress.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Cortes and Luis Jimenez] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Cortes] The explosion took place exactly 800 
meters from the Plaza Paitilla Inn on Via Italia. This happened 
at approximately 0820 [1320 GMT] this morning. Information 
gathered by RPC Radio from PTJ [Judicial Technical Police] 
agents reveals that the person wounded is Colombian Aaron 
Schwartz. He was seriously injured. His car was parked outside 
the Tamaco Building... 
  [Jimenez, interrupting] The Tamanaco Building. 
  [Cortes] Excuse me, the Tamanaco Building, where he lives. 
This is where Colombian citizen Aaron Schwartz lives. He was 
injured and taken to Paitilla Hospital. 
  On 13 May, Mr. Schwartz witnessed a kidnapping attempt in 
this same building. It seems the kidnappers constantly followed 
him. Last night, they managed to place a bomb in the rear of 
his car, a Cherokee four-wheel drive vehicle. It is a blue 
vehicle with brown molding on the sides and the license plate 
521054. 
  It is worth noting that he was being tailed because he had 
witnessed a kidnapping. The kidnappers felt he gave some 
information to the PTJ linking them to a kidnapping attempt in 
the Tamanaco Building in the Punta Paitilla area. 
  This is the part of the information we have been able to 
gather in the area of Punta Paitilla. The National Police are 
still cordoning off the area. Another vehicle was also damaged 
as a result of the explosion. By the way, a black Cherokee 
four-wheel drive vehicle was behind the vehicle that exploded. 
Some shrapnel also hit nearby homes. This is what is 
happening. The National Police are still investigating the 
incident and promise to provide details later. 
  We should also note that the driver of the black Cherokee 
who 
was driving behind the car that exploded this morning was 
unhurt, although the vehicle was badly damaged. The driver is a 
Jewish citizen. We tried to talk to him -- this man who 
witnessed everything -- but he refused to comment. 
  [Jimenez] In terms of the injured, we first learned one 
person was injured in the explosion. Later, we were informed 
someone else was injured. 
  [Cortes] This is what we have. We talked to some witnesses 
and one told us he was walking nearby when he heard the blast. 
When he turned around, he saw someone exiting the vehicle. It 
seems this person was seriously wounded. This is what the 
witness said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from "The RPC Television News"] </F>
  [Text] An explosive attack today on Via Italia in the Punta 
Paitilla area of Panama City injured one person and damaged 
nearby property. Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) have arrested 
two suspects. 
  Unidentified individuals planted a bomb in a Jeep Cherokee, 
which caught fire when the device detonated. The explosion was 
deafening and the shock wave made nearby buildings tremble. 
Residents were confused and scared. 
  The incident took place on Via Italia in the Punta Paitilla 
area of Panama City around 0800 today. This footage was filmed 
a few minutes after the violent explosion. The driver and owner 
of the vehicle is Jewish Panamanian businessman Aaron Schwartz, 
age 39, who miraculously survived the attack but is currently in 
serious condition at Paitilla Hospital. 
  The fire department responded efficiently but the vehicle 
with license plate 521054 could not be saved. According to 
eyewitnesses, Schwartz turned the key in the ignition of his 
vehicle, thus activating the bomb, which exploded seconds later. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] The man came out of 
the building, got into his vehicle, a Cherokee, started it, and 
five seconds later there was an explosion. That was it. 
  [Ortega) Did you carry him? Was he seriously injured? 
  [Speaker] When he stepped out of his vehicle it was already 
on fire. He was asking for help and nearly falling. He asked 
to be taken to a hospital. I was nearby so I grabbed him and 
took him to Paitilla Hospital. [end recording] 
  This is the first time a car bomb has been used in Panama to 
kill someone. According to the police, this is not a technique 
employed by Panamanian criminals. 
  [Begin PTJ official Ildefonso Suira recording] PTJ 
laboratory 
personnel are currently trying to determine the type of 
explosive used in this vehicle. I could also tell you that we 
currently have two individuals under investigation. They are 
Colombians. They are under arrest, and we are trying to 
determine their link to the case. [end recording] 
  According to reports, Aaron Schwartz had reported received 
death threats after he witnessed a kidnapping attempt on 13 May 
at the building where he lives, Tamanaco Building, in Paitilla. 
Aaron Schwartz is the cousin of Colon Free Zone businessman 
Saul Schwartz, who was kidnapped in Panama in June 1993 by a 
group of unidentified individuals who asked his relatives for a 
huge ransom. Saul was later released. 
  Only four seconds passed between the time the vehicle was 
started and the explosion. The pavement on Via Italia clearly 
shows the impact of the explosion. The authorities are trying 
to locate the perpetrators of this incident and to determine if 
there are other links to the crime. 
  Explosive experts found shrapnel in the area, and unofficial 
reports indicate that a fragmentation grenade was used in the 
attack. The rear door of the Cherokee has not been found. It 
apparently flew into the air following the violent explosion. 
  The truth is that these kinds of attacks make the community 
uneasy. Aaron Schwartz remains hospitalized at the Paitilla 
Hospital and is in critical condition. Our team of journalists 
tried to locate his wife at their Tamanaco Building apartment. 
  [Begin recording] [Ortega] We are from RPC Television. 
  [Schwarz' wife] No, no, I cannot speak to anyone now. 
  [Ortega] We want to know about your husband's health. How is 
he? [end recording] 
  The Cherokee station wagon also suffered the effects of the 
shock wave. Attacks with explosives are common in Colombia. 
These condemnable criminal actions are now taking place in Via 
Italia, Panama City. The police must take strong action against 
the criminals who are terrorizing society.

<F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara has requested a review of 
the U.S. proposal to make changes in the law that regulates the 
operation and administration of the Panama Canal. U.S. 
President Bill Clinton sent to the U.S. Congress a number of 
suggestions for changes in the law that regulates the Panama 
Canal. The proposal includes changing the Panama Canal 
Commission into a government corporation, making the 
requirements for the composition of its Board of Directors more 
flexible, and permitting the participation of international 
advisers in board meetings. In Panama, the president is 
studying the proposal. 
  [Begin Endara recording] I am not familiar with the details 
of Bill Clinton's proposal. From what I understand, President 
Clinton's proposal stems from a senator's proposal, which was 
studied by Panamanian authorities, and, in general, we agreed 
with it. Nevertheless, I am going to ask the five [number as 
heard] Panamanian members of the Panama Canal Commission's Board 
of Directors and the Presidential Commission on Panama Canal 
Affairs to undertake a study to enable the Panamanians to 
respond to the proposal. In general, I understand it is a good 
proposal. [end recording] 
  The changes suggested by Clinton include the review of tolls 
and the strengthening of the Panama Canal Commission 
regulations. In our country, sectors such as the Interoceanic 
Region Authority [ARI] agree with these changes. 
  [Begin ARI member Carlos Mendoza recording] The goal is to 
more smoothly, expeditiously, and functionally conduct the 
transition of the U.S.-administered Canal to a Panamanian 
administration, which begins on the first day of the year 2000. 
[end recording] 
  While officials evaluate the proposal, President Endara will 
discuss this topic with U.S. Vice President Al Gore in Honduras 
on 24 May.

  [Report by Jose Quintero De Leon] 
  [Text] Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria has asked all of 
the country's lawyers and members of the Supreme Court of 
Justice to establish something that was already done in 1991 -- 
to remove secrecy protection from corporations so that offenses 
can no longer be committed under this system. 
  His proposal was prompted by the scandal involving the 
Homsany Group, which the National Bank of Panama [BNP] and the 
Comptroller General's Office accuse of stealing millions of 
balboas from the BNP. "We cannot let corporations' secrecy 
serve to commit crimes," Comptroller Chen said. He said that in 
this particular case, his office is using a precedent set by 
Panamanian law regarding corporations. It would be up to the 
courts to determine if it is possible to remove the cover of 
secrecy from corporations, he said. 
  Regarding meddling by the Comptroller General's Office in 
this case, he said the office acted according to its 
responsibility and the law through the Directorate for the 
Recovery of State Property. 
  In those instances, the delegated District Attorney's Office 
continues gathering evidence, which clearly proves a crime was 
comitted. The Homsany Group is trying to evade justice by using 
the veil of corporations. "I hope the courts will do their work 
and that the proofs, which are categorical, will be sufficient 
for justice to prevail in Panama." 
  Chen Barria described what the Homsany Group did -- using 38 
companies to steal 5.6 million balboas -- as detrimental to the 
BNP's funds, which belong to all Panamanians. In fact, 33 of 
these 38 companies were never in business, but their legal 
representatives and those who signed as loan debtors were 
employees earning between $200 to $250. "All of this shows a 
duly structured and planned crime," Chen Barria commented. 
  The companies involved in this crime are not operating, but 
the comptroller general revealed that the Homsany Group is 
running these companies under other corporations.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 24 May. 
  Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas has 
reported that the Inter-American Development Bank has formally 
notified the Panamanian Government that it has complied with all 
requirements for the first disbursement of a $180 million loan. 
The funds will be used to repair and build roads. A delegation 
from the Planning and Health Ministries is also in Washington 
negotiating a $25 million loan from the World Bank for the 
health sector. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 18 May 94 p 1) 
  In the first four months of the year, the Panama City 
Construction and Projects Department issued 940 permits for 99 
million balboas worth of projects, compared to 854 permits for 
64 million balboas worth of projects in 1993. This amounts to a 
more than 34 million balboa increase in construction 
investments. (Panama City EL SIGLO in Spanish 22 May 94 p 6)

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The possibility of negotiating

NAFTA also presents Argentina with the difficulty of harmonizing 
it with integration processes in which it is already a member, 
basically ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] and 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. 
  The difficulties Mexico had due to Article No. 44 of the 
Montevideo Treaty are well known. This article obliges Mexico 
to extend to ALADI members the concessions negotiated within 
NAFTA. If Argentina negotiated a free trade agreement on its 
own with the United States, it also would have to request a 
waiver [preceding word in English] for Article No. 44 or 
compensate ALADI members. 
  In the case of Mercosur, the situation would be even more 
delicate if Argentina appeared alone on President Clinton's 
list. Notwithstanding, while the customs union is not perfect, 
Argentina could enter into negotiations with an eye to a free 
trade agreement with a country outside of its zone as long as it 
contains carefully written clauses of origin. If there was a 
common external tariff, then matters would become even more 
complicated. 
  Brazil's support would be necessary in order to successfully 
manage these facts. The alliance with Brazil has been and is 
one of the pillars of our foreign policy. On the other hand, 
Brazil has become our No. 1 trade partner and the main 
destination of our exports, especially those with greater added 
value. [passage omitted] 
  It is very probable there would be an even greater 
deterioration in the bilateral trade balance if there was a 
tariff reduction with the United States. This is born out by the 
fact that our levels of protection are even higher, and ours 
would be the larger concession in taking them to zero. In 
addition, a large part of the products we place on the U.S. 
market already have low tariffs (some at zero) or enter through 
the Generalized System of Preferences. If we grant a greater 
opening of our market to U.S. competition, the results could be 
very difficult to digest. This is not an argument against 
negotiations, but a warning regarding the drafting of a 
strategy: Negotiations must be very careful with respect to the 
time spans for the dismantling of tariffs barriers, including 
the safeguard mechanisms. 
  From the trade point of view, for the time being, Mercosur 
offers us better prospects given the characteristics of this 
market, which allows Argentina to export more products with 
added value. Forty percent of our exports to Mercosur countries 
are manufactured goods, while Argentine manufactured exports to 
the rest of the world amount to only 23 percent of our total 
exports. Only 14 percent of Argentine exports to Mercosur are 
agricultural products. Seventy-five percent of Argentine exports 
to the United States are food, drinks, industrial materials, and 
raw material. 
  NAFTA's most important effect is that it ensures a steady 
inflow of foreign investments. In the case of Mexico, direct 
foreign investment increased spectacularly from 1991 to 1992. 
U.S. and European investments increased 115 percent and 303 
percent, respectively, during the first months of 1992 alone in 
comparison with all of 1991 (countries like the UK, Japan, and 
Switzerland greatly contributed to this increase in investments). 
  An agreement like NAFTA will serve to consolidate the 
Argentine economic reforms of the past few years because it 
would open a horizon of stability and confidence in the future. 
  Beyond technical considerations that define the negotiations 
strategy, Argentine participation in a free trade agreement with 
the United States would, in part, be the result of the fact that 
Argentine domestic and foreign policies were and continue to be 
consistent with our moral values and national interests. 
  Bilateral relations developed with the United States that 
are 
based on common values and interests have allowed us to 
establish a more favorable framework for specific negotiations. 
In the same manner, the smooth relations we currently maintain 
with Brazil have allowed us to carry out negotiations for mutual 
benefit. 
  Within this current framework of harmony, we must continue 
making progress in our political and economic relations with our 
main partners. Beyond some difficulties in the definition of the 
common external zero tariff, Mercosur is a reality. It has 
yielded major benefits for Argentina and is still very 
promising. The possibility of access to NAFTA, although distant, 
exists and it also has a lot of potential benefits beyond the 
inconveniences it might bring us in the short term. Integration 
processes always entail some initial costs that one must be 
willing to pay in order to obtain future benefits. Argentina is 
a global trader and it must maintain relations with the whole 
world, without barring any option. 
  Although Argentina favors a free trade policy in the 
international field (our position in GATT has been fully 
consistent in this aspect), it must be recognized that despite 
the progress made, free trade is not a reality in the world. 
Even Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairperson of President Bill 
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, has admitted it: "Let us 
be realistic; there is no free trade in the world." If the 
world is heading toward the formation of economic blocs, it will 
not be good for Argentina to be left out of the most important 
ones. 
  The fact of being included in the report by the U.S. trade 
representative is, without doubt, an acknowledgement of 
President Menem's economic reforms. The possibility of beginning 
negotiations is in President Clinton's hands. It would be 
unwise, however, to think this is an essential matter for 
Argentina. A country's destiny is built gradually by the daily 
effort of all its inhabitants.

  [Text] A new branch of the Justicialist Party in the 
Federal Capital and Buenos Aires province was launched yesterday 
[24 May] by ultra-Menemists with deputy Erman Gonzalez and 
Restaurant Workers Union leader Luis Barrionuevo at the helm. 
The new faction, called Encuentro Peronista Bonaerense [Buenos 
Aires Peronist Movement], was the idea of some 30 Peronist 
political leaders and trade unionists. Barrionuevo told 
reporters in a press conference that the main platform for the 
new group would emphasize "getting back to Peronist basics such 
as health, education and unemployment." Later, Gonzalez said 
the group "will work in conjunction with the public and not via 
the media, which only seems to cater to other interests."

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 24 May (NA) -- The Criminal Court 
has upheld the dismissal of former de facto President Jorge 
Rafael Videla in a case filed by the Interior Ministry for 
allegedly approving a crime. 
  Following Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf's instructions, 
Alicia Pierini, the Interior Ministry under secretary for human 
rights, pressed charges following remarks he made during an 
amity dinner with retired military officers. 
  The former military officer noted that "he should have been 
given an award for his part in the struggle against subversion." 
Videla described himself as "a scapegoat of that struggle." 
[passage omitted] 
  The dismissal ruling mentions that Videla confirmed making 
the remarks mentioned in the charges, but, according to the 
judges, he did not maliciously seek to have his remarks 
published by newspapers or retold outside the group attending 
the dinner.

  [Text] La Paz, 16 May -- On 16 May, the Army General 
Command reported that the Armed Forces will carry out 
"anti-guerrilla training exercises" in the tropical areas of 
Cochabamba and throughout the country. 
  Army Commander General Reynaldo Caceres Quiroga told LOS 
TIEMPOS in La Paz that "antisubversive" logistic operations are 
being carried out by diverse military units in the region. They 
follow an "activities schedule" drafted by the Armed Forces 
Third Department. 
  Gen. Caceres said that at no time has his command ordered or 
instructed the 7th Army Division based in Cochabamba "to move 
military contingents" to Chapare, Ichoa, or Chimore to carry out 
an "alleged intelligence dragnet to investigate the existence of 
armed groups in the zone." 
  Caceres said remarks by Gen. Guido Tavera Leyton, commander 
of the 7th Army Division based in Cochabamba, were 
"misinterpreted" as a result of "superficial evaluations" on 
regular Armed Forces "antisubversive" operations. 
  Caceres said: "All military movements in Cochabamba's 
tropical region over the next few days are within the framework 
of routine maneuvers scheduled by regiments and military units 
based in the region." Caceres added, however, that Gen. Tavera 
Leyton's remarks in Cochabamba will be "thoroughly investigated" 
to definitively establish what happened to the military 
announcements that were released to the press last weekend. 
  The military chief said military activities in the zone 
merely seek to consolidate education, health, and basic 
sanitation projects in rural areas. "Those projects in no way 
seek to fight insurgent outbreaks in the zone. As far as the 
Army knows, they do not exist for there are only indications of 
that possibility," Caceres said. 
  Last weekend, the commander of the 7th Army Division based 
in 
Cochabamba told the press that Army intelligence agents were 
"moved" to the Chapare region to investigate the possible 
presence of irregular groups linked with drug traffickers. 
  Tavera Leyton also announced that a report will be released 
in the next few hours to inform the population whether there is 
evidence of subversive activities in Chapare, Chimore, and Ichoa. 
  The military chief said that in June, the Army will organize 
an "active" operation of all military units in the Chapare 
region to receive anti-guerrilla training. 
  Gen. Tavera said the Rene Barrientos Ortuno Regiment, based 
in the Colomi settlement, and the Captain Victor Ustarez 
Regiment, based in Tolata, will participate in the 
anti-guerrilla military exercises that will be carried out as a 
priority in the Chimore and Ichoa area. 
  Tavera also ruled out the possibility of declaring 
Cochabamba's Chapare region a "military zone" as a result of 
"the growing" drug trafficking activity in this coca region.

  [Text] La Paz, 14 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Within the next 30 
days, the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) will broaden its 
area of operations into the Bolivian Amazon region to prevent 
illegal drug trafficking by cutting off the traffickers "supply 
line." Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz Valenzuela 
confirmed this information today in La Paz. 
  Soliz reported the preparation of a "long-term project" for 
immediate implementation. He indicated that the new FELCN 
regional headquarters will probably be located in Cobija (Pando 
Department) and that the plan includes the participation of 
customs control mechanisms, police border posts, and the 
military units in the region. 
  FELCN Deputy Commander General Rogelio Vargas Ortuno 
reported 
that as a result of increased trafficking activities in some 
sectors of Beni and Pando Departments, a detailed study has been 
made on the creation of a so-called "permanent operational 
command" in this tropical region. 
  Gen. Vargas said the many FELCN intelligence reports on the 
dangerous growth of trafficking in the zone have received the 
appropriate attention of Bolivian officials. He added: "The 
creation of a regional FELCN headquarters is the result of that 
concern." 
  Vargas said many factors prompted national officials to 
create a permanent control post on the Brazilian border. He 
cited actions by FELCN agents a few weeks ago after settlers of 
the region opposed the arrest of a dozen traffickers. He said 
the regional command to be established in Pando will be 
permanent and similar to the ones in Santa Cruz, Trinidad, and 
Cochabamba. 
  The FELCN reported that the busiest drug routes in the 
Amazon 
region are the Guayaramerin-Riberalta-Serena (Rio Madre de 
Dios), and the Puerto Rico-Cobija (Pando) roads. The report 
indicates that the roads "frequently help" traffickers in the 
region to consolidate their illegal activity. 
  The report says these roads serve an area of about 600 
square 
km. Public transportation vehicles run on them and these are 
widely used by traffickers. The report adds that the drugs 
produced in the zone come mainly from San Joaquin and San Ramon 
(Beni Department).

  [Text] Minister of Government German Quiroga has asserted 
that almost all the coca produced in Chapare goes for drug 
trafficking and does not deserve executive branch support to 
legalize it. 
  Quiroga thus dismissed any possibility that the Decree on 
the 
Industrialization of Coca will be modified. This decree bans 
the industrialization of coca produced in Chapare, Cochabamba. 
  The minister asserted: "It seems some coca producers want to 
legalize it, but the government is not planning to do so because 
everyone in Bolivia knows that 80 or 90 percent of the coca 
produced in Chapare is surplus to requirements." He said the 
surplus production is earmarked exclusively for drug 
trafficking. To think of legalizing it would mean "legalizing 
the raw material for the production of drugs." Quiroga said 
there is no chance of this happening because it would go against 
the drug enforcement policy. 
  He explained that the controversial supreme decree and its 
regulations on the industrialization of coca complies with 
current Bolivian laws and international agreements. As such, 
the criticisms it has prompted are unjustified. 
  Quiroga believes "there is good coca and bad coca in 
Bolivia. 
The good coca deserve the support of all organizations for its 
industrialization so that it may be marketed properly." He 
added: "The bad coca does not deserve any support because it is 
earmarked for drug trafficking." 
  He said government authorities believe some leaders want the 
bad or surplus coca production to circulate freely in the 
country. This is not possible because by allowing this the 
government would be promoting drug trafficking. Quiroga 
concluded: "If the government yields to pressure seeking to 
legalize coca from areas that produce surplus production, it 
would be violating measures like Law No. 1008 and some 
international agreements. This is not possible and will not 
happen."

  [Text] La Paz, 19 May (ANF) -- It was officially announced 
that the government has decided to continue the plan to 
eradicate 3,000 hectares of coca this year and thus receive $20 
million in assistance from the United States. 
  National Social Defense Mario Solz said: "Bolivia urgently 
needs that financial aid to compensate for its balance of 
payments. The government wants to attain its goals without 
implementing forceful programs, but by convincing each coca 
plantation owner," the government official said. 
  According to official eradication figures, between January 
1993 and April 1994, just 2,500 hectares of coca plantations and 
18,000 square meters of coca nurseries were destroyed. 
  Despite the extraordinary U.S. concession, Bolivia was 
unable 
to fulfill its goal of eradicating 5,000 hectares of coca and 
20,000 square meters of nurseries by last March. For this 
reason, the $20 million disbursement was suspended by the United 
States. 
  The executive branch and the Bolivian ambassador to 
Washington have obtained an extension so as not to lose aid 
which is "important for the 1994 balance of payments." 
  Meanwhile, the Alternative Development Under Secretariat has 
reported that it continues its program of paying $2,000 for each 
hectare of eradicated coca crops. In turn, the five federations 
of coca producers have declared "a state of emergency and 
mobilizations in face of an imminent militarization of the 
Chapare region," even though the government and the Armed Forces 
have denied this.

  [Excerpt] La Paz, 17 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- According to the 
conclusions reached by the Military Justice Court, the arms 
trafficking "affair" carried out in the name of Bolivia from 
1991 to 1992 in Europe and Asia involved an estimated $59 
million and a considerable number of companies and countries 
linked to illegal global arms trafficking. 
  Defense Minister Raul Tovar Pierola disclosed this 
information on 17 May at the conclusion of the ceremony honoring 
the 180th anniversary of the creation of the Argentine Navy, 
which was held at the Bolivian Military Naval School. 
  Minister Tovar also announced that the conclusions of the 
summary proceedings delivered by the Military Justice Court, 
which are to be submitted to authorities this week, will lead to 
the "opening of criminal proceedings against approximately 70 
people, among them civilians and military personnel, who are 
involved in this case" for trial in the regular courts. 
  Tovar said: "They will all go to the regular courts because 
those involved in the crimes can only be labeled common 
criminals, as they have seriously harmed the nation." He did 
not, however, reveal the names of the people to be accused of 
criminal acts before the regular courts. 
  He said the number of people involved in the "affair" is 
large, but refused to give their names. He admitted, however, 
that there are more foreigners than nationals involved in this 
case. 
  He added: "Many Bolivians took advantage of the 
circumstances, and there is evidence that some institutions were 
negligent in the fulfillment of their functions and duties."

  [Text] Congressional leaders in the Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party [PMDB] have not accepted PMDB presidential 
candidate Orestes Quercia's proposal to break with Itamar 
Franco's government. Quercia contends that if the PMDB does not 
withdraw its support for the government, it will ultimately help 
approve and consolidate the current economic plan that, in his 
opinion, is being used as an electoral tool by Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
  The PMDB leaders want to maintain their support for the 
government and its plan. This division within the party will be 
another stumbling block in Quercia's candidacy. He is already 
facing the PMDB branches' opposition in the states of Rio Grande 
do Sul and Parana and a lack of mobilization in several other 
states. 
  Deputy Tarcisio Delgado (Minas Gerais State), PMDB leader in 
the Chamber of Deputies, supports Quercia's candidacy. He is, 
however, in favor of maintaining PMDB support for the 
government. He said: "We are going to maintain our proposal of 
lending the government our support, but without relinquishing 
our right to criticize." 
  Senator Mauro Benevides (Ceara State), PMDB leader in the 
Senate, who also supports Quercia, said the party "is committed 
to promoting governability. If the PMDB just pulled out of the 
government, it could hurt several projects of national interest." 
  During the convention that approved his nomination, Quercia 
characterized Franco's government as "small and low." Quercia 
himself admitted that it would not be easy to break away from 
the government. In addition to having three ministers serving 
in Franco's cabinet -- Sinval Guazelli (agriculture), Aluizio 
Alves (regional integration), and Murilio Hingel (education) -- 
the PMDB has many other members holding offices in the federal 
government. 
  PMDB National President Luiz Henrique told FOLHA he is not 
going to convene the PMDB Political Council (which consists of 
54 members) to discuss the matter even if someone formally 
proposes the PMDB withdraw from the government. 
  The 22 May convention showed that Quercia has problems in 
several states. He obtained only 27 votes of the total of 86 
delegates representing Minas Gerais State. Quercia only 
obtained two votes of the total of 54 delegates to which the 
states of Rio Grande do Sul and Parana are entitled.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Quercia"] </F>
  [Text] After the "soap opera" involving former President 
Jose Sarney's candidacy, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party 
[PMDB] nominated former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia as 
its candidate for Planalto Palace during the party's national 
convention, which was held last weekend. 
  This candidacy faces considerable difficulties. Quercia's 
image as a politician and administrator, which has been 
surrounded by doubts and suspicions for a long time, is now 
exposed to a still more serious threat resulting from the fraud 
charges filed against him by the Federal Prosecutor's Office. 
As if this were not enough, the Superior Court may decide to 
uphold the charges right in the middle of a campaign in which 
there will be more concern about ethics and honesty than before. 
  Quercia is also facing problems inside his own party. 
Despite 
his power over the PMDB machinery, there is serious resistance 
to his candidacy in several states. The large number of 
abstentions during the voting in the party primaries and the 
party convention indicate that Quercia can hardly count on the 
party's overall support. In addition, the fact that the PMDB is 
still the largest Brazilian party will no longer be important if 
its members are not effectively devoted to ensuring the 
candidate's victory in the elections. 
  The Democratic Social Party members' lack of interest in 
Cristiano Machado's electoral campaign in 1950, when most of the 
party decided to support Getulio Vargas' candidacy, gave birth 
to the term "Christianize." Ulysses Guimaraes' defeat as a 
presidential candidate in 1989, when he was abandoned by the 
PMDB during his presidential campaign, is the most prominent 
example of similar behavior in recent years. 
  Quercia, however, is entitled to comparatively long, free 
electoral propaganda time on radio and television. Many believe 
he will use this time to involve the campaign in such an 
exchange of accusations that he will neutralize suspicions 
hanging over his head. An old-fashioned politician who is 
personal and addicted to the most traditional sort of political 
patronage, he has already started the campaign with a populist 
and aggressive attack against his adversaries. All that remains 
to be seen is whether this will be enough to reverse his weak 
performance in the electoral polls.

  [Text] The first technical test has not confirmed the 
authenticity of the typewritten sheets of paper that Rio de 
Janeiro Prosecutor General Antonio Carlos Biscaia presented as 
the numbers game kingpins' accounting sheets. 
  The test conducted by the Del Picchia Institute of Sao Paulo 
indicated that the sheets had not been prepared one month after 
the other, as monthly accounting sheets would have been expected 
to be. The test indicated that they had been prepared recently. 
  Biscaia did not allow an official test to be conducted. He 
used the documents as evidence in charges that involved bribery 
with money resulting from the illegal game, drug trafficking, 
and arms smuggling. Appellate Court Judge Gama Malcher ordered 
that the documents be tested again.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "The New </F>
Target of Traffickers"] 
  [Text] There is a new color in the uniforms of Rio de 
Janeiro drug traffickers: olive green. Although the information 
has not yet been confirmed, the precise details that have been 
supplied do not allow for many doubts. For months in Santa 
Cruz, the Conjunto Antares drug traffickers' boss has dressed 
his men in Army uniforms! Two members of the gang led by the 
trafficker, who "works" under the curious alias of 
Soldier, were arrested by the Drug Control Precinct 
(DRE), and revealed that the uniforms are obtained from recruits 
serving in Western Zone barracks. Soldier does not 
buy them; he barters them for drugs. The recruits are not only 
addicts. According to a former drug spot manager -- 
an important post in the drug trafficking hierarchy -- they 
receive "a larger amount of drugs" for each stolen uniform in 
order to open a market in a privileged sector: the barracks! 
  This information is serious, but not because it deals with a 
bold attack against the Army. After all, how long have 
newspapers been reporting successive arms robberies from Army 
barracks? This has happened not only in Rio de Janeiro and -- 
to tell the truth -- not only in the Army, because the Navy and 
the Air Force have also been victims of that crime. It would be 
enough to know the caliber of the arms that the police have 
seized from drug traffickers' arsenals to identify the link 
between the broad availability of heavy weapons, which are for 
military use only, and drug trafficking. The problem consists in 
the new step forward: the possession of uniforms. 
  The fact that drug traffickers steal uniforms used by 
Brazilians who are serving in the national Army has obvious 
significance. It is, as such, so serious that no additional 
observation is necessary. Aside from the worrisome implications 
of traffickers dressed in uniform, what is the objective of 
bartering military uniforms for drugs? To have an "assortment" 
that can open any door? Or, in the next fight with the PM 
[Military Police] or the Civil Police, make traffickers appear 
as Army members, creating an institutional crisis? 
  Those who hurriedly proclaim that "the Army on the streets" 
is the only solution for the state of calamity in Rio de Janeiro 
should reflect a bit on why traffickers want military uniforms. 
The Conjunto Antares soldiers have confirmed the 
possibility for drug trafficking to enter the barracks. This is 
why it is necessary to pay attention to one fact: The longer the 
Army remains in direct contact -- through repression -- with the 
world of drugs, the longer Army soldiers -- the true soldiers -- 
will be exposed to a dangerous coexistence. Those who always 
imagine that the worst will happen should carefully reflect on 
the robbery of uniforms. The vulnerability of the forces of law 
might be at stake. That is why it is important to find out, as 
soon as possible, the reason why drug trafficking has chosen 
this target. 
  Those who imagine that the price of cocaine is the main 
antidote against troop contamination should recall 
the September poll results by the Rio de Janeiro State Drug 
Control Council. According to this poll, 28 percent of the 
addicts who tried to obtain some help to end their addiction 
earn a minimum salary, while 56 percent of cocaine consumers 
live in the northern Rio de Janeiro zone! The poll's conclusion 
deserves attention: Drugs have reached sectors that do not have 
enough money to buy meat. 
  Drug traffickers have an organization that observes methods 
and adopts efficiency techniques. In July in the Tijuca forest, 
Drug Control Precinct agents clashed with drug traffickers in a 
battle in which the latter used authentic guerrilla warfare 
methods. In the Roquete Pinto ghetto, the troops that protected 
the area after shots were fired on a recruit of the Ramos 1st 
Infantry Battalion found a surprising copy of their methods. 
For the time being, stolen uniforms are only a "passport" to a 
concentrated, well located market. They hint, however, at 
another type of use that is hard to identify by using common 
sense. Yet common sense advises that if the worst is to be 
avoided, the Army should keep away from drug trafficking.

The project costs amount to $1.1 billion and will be implemented

  The winners of the tender are a U.S. consortium led by 
Raytheon and a French consortium led by the state-owned Thomson

<F P=106> [By Isabel Dias de Aguiar] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo, 24 May (AE) -- The position of Brazilian 
exports on the international market is vulnerable. Brazil is 
running the risk of being considered a country that indulges in 
social dumping, and one that could suffer retaliatory actions 
for not having legislation to regulate industrial property in a 
way that is acceptable to developed countries. Furthermore, 
with the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) -- an agreement that includes Canada, Mexico, and the 
United States -- Brazilian products are facing the risk of not 
being able to reach the U.S. market at competitive prices. The 
U.S. market accounts for nearly half of all manufactured 
products exported by Sao Paulo State. Carlos Eduardo Moreira 
Ferreira, president of the Sao Paulo State Federation of 
Industries (FIESP), has conveyed these concerns to U.S. Treasury 
Under Secretary Lawrence Summers. 
  Summers visited FIESP to hear suggestions for the agenda of 
the Summit of the Americas to be held in Miami in December. Yet 
instead of making proposals for the meeting on ways to restore 
the flow of capital and credit toward Latin American countries, 
Summers was asked to discuss issues concerning Brazil and the 
United States as trade partners. Ferreira argued that Brazilian 
industry cannot be charged with practicing social dumping 
because it has to bear a heavy social burden amounting to 110 
percent of its salary payments. 
  Boris Tabacof, director of the FIESP Economic Department, 
said Ferreira's concern reflects the prevailing mood among 
Brazilian businessmen. Tabacof added that U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's efforts to defend U.S. industrial interests should 
make the Brazilian Government remain alert. He believes 
international competition will become tougher in the next few 
years. The Americans are inclined to be selective and 
protectionist. The advent of NAFTA has made things worse for 
Brazilian exporters. Mexico competes with Brazil as a supplier 
of major items such as steel, orange juice, auto parts, 
vehicles, and sugar. According to Ferreira, Brazil runs the 
risk of suffering unfair competition, particularly if the NAFTA 
rules concerning the origin of products are not respected. 
  At a luncheon attended by nearly 50 businessmen, Summers 
said 
he is optimistic about the outcome of the Brazilian economic 
stabilization plan. He said the U.S. Government is determined 
to contribute to making the plan a success through financial 
help and through incentives for investing in the country.

  [Text] Yesterday, Foreign Under Secretary Jose Miguel 
Insulza stated that Chile believes resorting to military action 
to restore democracy in Haiti would be inappropriate. Yesterday, 
Insulza discussed the situation on the Caribbean island with 
U.S. Ambassador Curtis Kamman, whom he summoned to disclose the 
Chilean stance regarding this subject of continental interest. 
Referring to the meeting, Insulza said: "I think everyone (the 
countries) is aware that military action would be inappropriate." 
  President Bill Clinton has mentioned the possibility of 
direct action to restore democracy in Haiti. Moreover, Insulza 
stated that Chile regards the appointment of a president in 
Port-au-Prince other than Jean-Bertrand Aristide as unacceptable. 
  Insulza explained that an agreement was reached with the 
U.S. 
ambassador to channel any actions referring to the situation in 
Haiti through multilateral organizations such as the OAS and the 
United Nations. 
  Insulza voiced support for the blockade against Haiti, 
noting 
that it entails neither food nor medicines. He added: "For 
many years this is all the people of Haiti have had access to." 
  Insulza also disclosed that the Chilean ambassador to Haiti, 
Luis Larrain, is currently in Santiago for consultations, but 
that he will soon return to Port-au-Prince.

  [Text] Santiago, 24 May (EFE) -- Chilean Foreign Minister 
Carlos Figueroa will travel to Buenos Aires on 8 June to start 
negotiating a commercial partnership between Chile and the 
Common Market of the South, Mercosur. 
  During a news conference, Figueroa said that "during this 
phase, we are going to propose establishing a partnership with 
Mercosur that will allow us to make gradual progress, first 
within the framework of a broad agreement that will entail not 
only commercial variables, but also investments and services." 
  Figueroa explained that this does not mean joining Mercosur, 
and reiterated that Chile cannot become a member of the 
mentioned bloc because, among other reasons, Chilean customs 
tariffs are much lower than those of Mercosur, which is composed 
of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay. 
  Figueroa added that Chile's interest in establishing some 
sort of partnership with Mercosur is partly due to the 
importance Chile grants Brazil and Argentina, its third and 
fourth largest commercial partners respectively, after the 
United States and Japan. 
  The minister asserted that within this context, it is 
necessary to perfect an agreement that will preserve the tariff 
advantages Chile currently enjoys with those two countries. 
  Figueroa explained that in Buenos Aires, he hopes to start 
negotiations with his Argentine counterpart Guido Di Tella and 
also with the rest of the Mercosur member countries. The idea 
is to explore a form of partnership that will be advantageous 
for all. He added that President Eduardo Frei's government has 
made a political decision "and we have all received precise 
instructions to start working on it." 
  Figueroa said Chile took this path after Brazil proposed 
creating a hemispheric free trade organization and receiving a 
similar invitation from Argentine Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo during his recent visit to Santiago. These proposals 
have opened a space for us to start working on a sort of 
partnership with Mercosur, said Minister Figueroa. He 
reiterated that Chile is all for bilateral and multilateral 
agreements as long as they contribute to opening trade and new 
markets and "not locking us into exchange inefficiency."

  [Text] Quito, 25 May (EFE) -- A large area of Quito was 
left without drinking water when two charges of dynamite 
exploded in the city's main water processing plant early 
yesterday. Today, the police continue defusing explosives in 
the installation, Patricio Ribadeneira, manager of the Municipal 
Drinking Water Enterprise (EMAP), stated. 
  The explosives destroyed the energy tower that allows the 
plant to function. No group has claimed responsibility for the 
attack, which "regrettably means the suspension of drinking 
water service in a large area of the city for several days," the 
manager noted. "The police are also helping workers of EMAP and 
the electricity enterprise handle the problem because some 
charges have not exploded and constitute an imminent danger, 
Ribadeneira added.

  Abreu arrived in Asuncion this morning. He was received by 
his Paraguayan counterpart Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner. 
  Talking about his 3-day official visit, Abreu said he will 
discuss the common foreign tariff and other bilateral and 
regional issues with Paraguayan officials. He will also invite 
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy to the inauguration of the Martin 
Garcia Channel dredging, in Montevideo, on 10 June. Argentine 
President Carlos Menem is also scheduled to attend. 
  Tomorrow, Foreign Minister Abreu will sign various

  [Text] Police Superintendent Juan Angel Aguero, chief of 
the Narcotics Department of the National Police, has warned that 
cocaine trafficking has grown by remarkable proportions in our 
country. He added that this information is based on the latest 
seizures of the valuable yet illegal merchandise in our country. 
  Aguero said: "There is a noticeable increase that is easy to 
detect in the latest drug seizures," adding that cocaine 
trafficking in Paraguay has grown considerably. 
  Aguero noted that drug seizures were smaller than the latest 
seizures, especially those made so far this year. Aguero added: 
"The trade is growing and cocaine trafficking is flourishing. 
We have no information on a group of cocaine addicts in 
Paraguay, but we know we are on the drug route. Trafficking has 
grown in Paraguay." 
  Aguero said the National Narcotics Directorate (Dinar) and 
the Narcotics Department of the National Police's work has been 
successful. "Dinar has in a few weeks confiscated more cocaine 
than the total confiscated in an entire year," Aguero said to 
prove his remarks. 
  According to National Antinarcotics Secretariat (Senad) 
information, 34,200 grams of high-purity cocaine from the 
Bolivian cartel of Santa Cruz de la Sierra was seized in April 
and May. Normally, cocaine seizures amount to only a few kilos 
per year, Senad sources said. 
  Aguero said mobile laboratories for producing cocaine have 
not yet been detected in our country. "There were reports that 
a border `mini-cartel' had a cocaine-producing laboratory in the 
Chaco or in the town of Pedro Juan Caballero, but so far we have 
been unable to confirm anything but drug trafficking." 
  The police official said the cocaine issue could be serious, 
considering the ratio accepted worldwide between the quantity of 
drugs seized and the volume that reaches its illegal market. 
"If we consider the accepted worldwide ratio, it may become a 
concern. Only 20 percent is being confiscated, while 80 percent 
reaches its destination. It is difficult to seize more," he 
said. "This means that if 50 kg are seized, it represents only 
20 percent of the entire shipment. Traffickers are getting most 
of their shipments to their destinations," the police official 
said. 
  Aguero added that recent cocaine seizures prove "there is an 
excess of narcotics. We must optimize our work, uniting 
security organization forces in the drug enforcement effort."

  [Text] At about 1700 yesterday, Dinar [National Narcotics 
Directorate] Intelligence Department agents, headed by Dinar 
Director Inspector Publio Fretes, retired, and legally supported 
by Judge Angel Barchini, raided a house at 1937 Mariscal Lopez 
Avenue near President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's residence. 
  The antinarcotics agents thoroughly checked the house with 
the assistance of super dog "Flyn." The dog went to a desk in 
the living room and found three packages containing white 
powder. A "narcotest" confirmed that the powder was cocaine 
hydrochloride (pure cocaine). The packages weighed 3 kg. The 
agents continued checking the house and discovered two 
.22-caliber rifles, one with a telescopic sight; one 
7.65-caliber pistol; and one .38-caliber revolver. They also 
discovered $3,500 in allegedly counterfeit bills. 
  The occupant, identified as Roque Maximo Villalba Acevedo, 
31, a married Paraguayan citizen, and his uncle, Wellington 
Acevedo, also a married Paraguayan citizen, were immediately 
detained. Judge Barchini ordered the detention of the two 
alleged traffickers who were taken to the Dinar headquarters 
where they are being held incommunicado. 
  The detainees were talking with two Automotor company 
employees who reportedly went to the house to collect 
installments on seven Hyundai cars that the traffickers 
reportedly purchased about one month ago. The employees were 
released as the judge believe they are not involved in the 
affair whatsoever. 
  The cache, worth almost 100 million guaranies, was allegedly 
shipped by the Santa Cruz Cartel and was allegedly to be 
marketed in our country by the detainees. This raid was not 
easy for the Dinar agents due to the strategic location of the 
"traffickers" house. 
  A second raid, also linked to this case, was carried out at 
a 
building near the intersection of 3 de Noviembre Street and 
Eusebio Ayala Avenue, specifically at the "Villalba Avalos Real 
Estate Company." Maximo Wenceslao Villalba Fernandez, 37, the 
office manager, was interrogated. The office was allegedly 
being used by the "traffickers" for their commercial operations. 
Not a trace of drugs was discovered in the office. 
  To crown the Dinar-legal raid, a lady, allegedly the mother 
of other stock holders of the company, entered the office and 
began a heated argument with another relative over the situation.

  [Text] Today, Economy Minister Jorge Camet reported that 
the salaries of public servants will increase by the second half 
of 1994. He also announced that the letter of intent with the 
IMF, which will be signed in the next few days, will not be 
amended. He made this announcement at the end of a meeting of 
the CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] Economy and Budget 
Committee. 
  Economy Minister Camet attended the CCD Economy and Budget 
Committee meeting with Central Reserve Bank President German 
Suarez. During the meeting, Camet briefed the congressional 
committee on the letter of intent that will be signed with the 
IMF. 
  [Begin recording] [Camet] I think it will be signed in the 
next eight days because although legislators have made some 
proposals, no one has proposed any major changes. [passage 
indistinct] No one has proposed any major changes. 
  [First unidentified reporter] No one has proposed any 
amendments? 
  [Second unidentified reporter] Will some issues contained in 
the letter of intent agreed upon with the IMF be politicized? 
  [Camet] Well, [name indistinct] has requested the 
elimination 
of some taxes. We will obviously not do this with the funds 
obtained from the privatization process, as these are assets 
that could be sold only once, and we must invest this in 
production. 
  [Third unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] any reform 
for the time being? 
  [Camet] No basic amendment. We have heard important 
comments, but none of them compel us to adopt any major changes. 
  [Second reporter] Teachers are staging a strike to demand 
better salaries. Will there be another salary increase? 
  [Camet] A salary increase is feasible for the second half of 
the year, depending on the tax revenue we collect, which I hope 
will be positive, as I have already mentioned. Teachers and 
health workers have nevertheless received major salary 
increases, much higher than [words indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] Lima, 25 May (EFE) -- In a communique issued today 
in Lima, the Huallaga Military Command reports that a total of 
30 Shining Path (SL) members were arrested by Army patrols in 
the Huallaga jungle area. 
  The communique adds that the "narcoterrorist criminals," as 
they are described in the official report, were arrested during 
military operations in the Huallaga region encompassing San 
Martin and Huanuco Departments. The communique, however, does 
not specify the dates the arrests were made. 
  The communique also reports that on 24 May, an Army patrol 
seized guns, explosives, ammunition, medicine, and propaganda 
material from a terrorist group in Leoncio Prado Province's Arab 
district, in Huanuco Department. 
  Peruvian security forces have been conducting an 
antiterrorist military operation in Leoncio Prado since 5 April 
against SL columns, which have been disrupted. 
  According to previous official communiques, military patrols 
killed 15 SL members and arrested another 11 in Leoncio Prado 
and Pachitea between 20 and 23 May. 
  Moreover, today, Daniel Espichan, special prosecutor for 
terrorist crimes, reported that a total of 4,138 terrorists have 
resorted to the repentance law so far. Those terrorists who use 
this law or cooperate with security forces have their sentences 
reduced. Espichan added that this figure does not include those 
who surrendered in the Huallaga region, whose number was not 
specified. In a statement to the press, Espichan added that 
4,800 people are imprisoned in several national jails on charges 
of perpetrating terrorist crimes.

  [Text] The government has not implemented a shock 
[preceding word in English] economic policy because pensions are 
indexed by constitutional mandate and because it was impossible 
to apply the process of reducing public expenditures due to the 
failure of privatizations. This is why the anti-inflationary 
measures have followed a "gradualist" course, Economy Minister 
Ignacio Posadas stressed in remarks to the Argentine newspaper 
AMBITO FINANCIERO. 
  Referring to the Argentine convertibility plan, the minister 
said: "The transformation Argentina has experienced has impact, 
is revolutionary." And his opinion is that convertibility has 
"a symbolic value, but in my opinion it does not compare with 
structural reforms that are more substantial and long lasting." 
  Posadas admitted: "There was a time when our government 
seriously debated the possibility of implementing something 
similar, but it did not because the indexation of pensions 
imposed by the Constitution would have implied that a shock 
[preceding word in English] policy would have been followed by 
an enormous increase in social security expenditure." 
  He also added: "It was not possible to synchronize the 
process with the generation of fiscal resources from 
privatizations; this is a minority government. This was the 
great difference (with Argentina) that made us adopt a 
gradualist anti-inflationary strategy." 
  Referring to "currency over-evaluation," the minister said 
"this is a topic being discussed throughout Latin America," and 
that the so-called "over-evaluation" is nothing less than the 
level of competition of national enterprises when compared with 
foreign enterprises. "It would be dangerous to generalize 
because it implies not acknowledging the fact that some 
enterprises have had problems and others have made progress," he 
said. 
  Posadas indicated that it is not fair to attribute 
competition problems to exchange rate problems "because there 
are a series of factors in play: salary agreements within the 
private sector that have not come up to expectations; certain 
markets that receive our exports have suffered a recessionary 
period during the past few years; and some of our competitors, 
such as Southeast Asia, have had much lower costs than our own." 
  He also cited the argument of the inflow of capital that has 
kept the dollar at a low price in our market and has led the 
Central Bank to intervene in order to sustain the dollar to 
prevent a greater loss of competition by enterprises. "In any 
case, what can be questioned is whether every thing is being 
done, but what cannot be denied is that in this respect an 
active policy has been followed," the minister said. The 
minister rejected devaluation to improve competition because it 
would only be "a short-term improvement that would lead to 
greater inflation." 
  Posadas also evaluated the current government's 
accomplishments, saying: "We can feel satisfied if we take into 
account this government's starting point, but if we measure our 
task with all that we wanted to do and with what the country 
needs, then we have to acknowledge that we have not achieved all 
that we would have liked to."

  [Text] Economy Minister Ignacio Posadas did not want to 
give an opinion on whether the executive branch will veto the 
"interpretive law," which will permit a 6 percent salary 
increase, retroactive to 1 January, for employees and teachers 
at the University of the Republic. With his usual directness 
and without concessions, the minister indicated that the 
responsibility for the salary increase does not lie with the 
executive branch and he criticized those who are pressuring 
Congress during an election year to obtain benefits. 
  "The executive branch has had to say no to salary demands, 
not only from the university but other sectors too, basically 
due to two factors: Because it does not have the money and 
because the Constitution wisely prevents the granting of salary 
increases in an election year in order to avoid demagogic 
pressure and weaknesses," the minister said. 
  He stressed that the interpretative law prevents this 
unconstitutionality and provides the resources. "Anyway, I 
believe there is nothing good in pressuring Congress during an 
election year in order to obtain salary increases," Posadas 
stressed. 
  When he was asked if the law would be viable if it provides 
the resources, the minister said: "All of this undoubtedly means 
a greater sacrifice for the people." 
  He did not wish to guarantee whether the executive branch 
would veto the "interpretative law" if it is approved today in 
the Chamber of Deputies and finally promulgated. "I am part of 
the executive branch, but I am not the executive branch; so let 
us see what is resolved," he said. 
  Posadas added that the executive branch is not authorized to 
disperse funds to serve this type of demand. "In these matters 
arguments are always used that are not in keeping with reality. 
It is said: We defend the university, which is being attacked 
by the executive branch. The executive branch does not attack 
the university, and this (conflict) is definitely not being 
carried out to defend the university. These are people who are 
asking for higher salaries (and) this is not a bad thing, but it 
is the truth. To make a big uproar to defend the university is 
somewhat conspicuous," he said. 
  "There is definitely not much heroism in this because who is 
going to pay? Those who are making the demands -- of course 
not; you (the taxpayers) are going to pay because now we 
complete the vicious circle: The executive branch has no money 
in its pockets, it has no money of its own. If they oblige it 
to pay more, well then the executive branch is going to take the 
money from you; there is no other way," he emphasized. 
  When he was asked how conflicts such as the university 
conflict are resolved, he said: "The solution to conflicts must 
come from those who create them because here we have another 
very curious thing: A conflict is generated and then they go and 
ask the other party how to resolve it; (the conflict) was not my 
idea."

  [Excerpt] On 19 May, the National Executive Committee of 
the Herreraist faction unanimously proclaimed Juan Andres 
Ramirez its presidential candidate. They also approved the 
first five candidates for the Senate by a majority. 
  The executive committee of the majority faction of the party 
also approved the report drafted by its Political Affairs 
Committee -- thus confirming what EL PAIS published yesterday -- 
recommending that the faction's convention on 22 May approves 
these two points. 
  Ramirez' proclamation, which was the first point, was 
unanimously approved. The second point, regarding the list of 
members for the Senate, received a negative vote from Deputy 
Arturo Heber and reservations from two other leaders. 
  Senator Jorge Silveira Zavala, president of the Herreraist 
faction, announced this at the end of a two and a half hour 
meeting. He confirmed that the Senate list will be headed by 
Transport and Public Works Minister Juan Carlos Raffo, San Jose 
Mayor Juan Chiruchi, Deputy Luis Alberto Heber (Rivera 
Department), Deputy Carlos Garat (Colonia Department), and 
Uruguay Tourne, a former senator and current member of the 
National party's executive board. 
  The executive board decided to postpone selecting the 
candidate for the vice presidency. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has indicated that in 
Venezuela, there is a high demand for foreign exchange by 
speculators and that his government has been questioned for 
political rather than economic reasons. Caldera stated that an 
abnormal situation prevails in the country but added that his 
government will win the confidence battle. 
  Caldera emphasized the fact that there are currently two 
crises. One is the institutional crisis resulting from the 
trials of former Presidents Jaime Lusinchi and Carlos Andres 
Perez and the transitional government led by Jose Ramon 
Velasquez, which gave public employees a salary increase without 
enough available funds. The other is the economic crisis 
resulting from the intervention involving Banco Latino.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaqueline Aponte] </F>
  [Text] Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera has said the 
country's fiscal deficit is worsening mainly because of the 
crisis in the banking sector -- a crisis he says has prompted 
irregular, unjustifiable, and perverse pressure on Venezuelan 
currency to convert it to foreign currency, which is 
impoverishing our nation. 
  He said the state currently does not have a plethora of 
resources as it did in the past when resources were squandered 
and used to encourage physical and moral corruption. He said: 
"We do not have a great deal of money in our budget; instead, we 
have found a tremendous deficit that is getting worse for a 
thousand reasons." 
  Speaking at the Saturday inauguration of a newly built 
section of the Trapichito neighborhood in Valencia, President 
Caldera noted that although resources are scarce, there still 
exists a great deal of hope, desire, and a strong work ethic in 
the nation. He added that, through the joint efforts of various 
state offices that deal with public housing and slums, the 
nation will face these social problems, which it still considers 
a priority. 
  "I feel a special calling to resolve the housing and slum 
problems, and the government I head is committed to this and 
intends to struggle and open the way to clean up slums 
throughout the country and boost housing at every level in 
accordance with the economic needs of the dwellers," Caldera 
concluded.

  [Text] During a meeting at the Banco de la Construccion, it 
was announced that, as of Monday, the stockholders of all banks 
receiving financial assistance from Fogade [Deposit Guarantee 
and Banking Protection Fund] will have 15 days to underwrite the 
capital needed to cover the losses incurred by the banks. It 
was also announced that Fogade will take control of all 
subsidized banks failing to meet this requirement. 
  The meeting marked the end of the financial assistance 
agreement with the banks, and now the goal is for the banks to 
begin operating on their own and to start repaying the funds 
provided by Fogade. Here are statements by Fogade President 
Noris Aguirre: 
  [Begin Aguirre recording, in progress] ...Fogade has simply 
waived conditional ownership. We should remember that in no way 
have we forfeited the rest of the shares placed under our 
control as creditors as a result of the financial assistance we 
provided. It is only [words indistinct] currently in effect in 
those banks that can replace all of the capital due by 1630 on 
15 June. If by that time the stockholders have not guaranteed 
this capital, Fogade will be entitled to seize operational 
control. 
  Nevertheless, as of today, the management of these banking 
institutions remains under the control of the Venezuelan state 
-- a move intended to ensure the openness of the entire process 
and the beginning of a new climate of trust. To me personally, 
it is a pleasure to announce that I have just received the 
requirements [words indistinct] and many of the banks' clearing 
houses have responded favorably. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Banco Metropolitano and Banco Barinas have 
scheduled stockholders meetings for Tuesday.

<F P=106> [Report by Fabioli Vechionacce from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The value of the bolivar fell more than 29 percent 
on Tuesday in response to changes implemented by the Central 
Bank of Venezuela in the mechanism for allocating dollars for 
commercial banks. 
  As of Tuesday, the official average exchange rate at the 
Central Bank of Venezuela was 156.31 bolivares to the dollar, 
which means dollars were sold by [words indistinct] at a minimum 
price of 151.50 and a maximum of 175 bolivares. There was a 
36-bolivar increase over the official closing price the previous 
day, which was 139 bolivares. As for the unofficial market, 
there was a 3-bolivar drop compared to the closing price on 
Monday. At six banks, the dollar was sold for as much as 180 
bolivares, which broke the previous highest rate by 15 
bolivares. The devaluation of our currency could be described 
as historic if we bear in mind that in 1993 the total 
devaluation was 33.2 percent. That is the response to the new 
system [words indistinct] dollars by the Central Bank of 
Venezuela, which has its pros and cons because at least the 
Venezuelan Petroleum Chamber believes it is a positive step 
toward strengthening the country's economy. 
  [Words indistinct] from the Venezuelan Petroleum Chamber 
said: 
  [Begin recording][Venezuelan Petroleum Chamber official, in 
progress] ...to return to the country's exchange rate, and we 
hope to return to this reality. We must not return to an 
artificial, controlled exchange rate. We hope to adapt to a 
progressive devaluation. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Today, how much was [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Petroleum Chamber official] In the case of several 
companies 
affiliated with the Petroleum Chamber, the rate is 170 or 172 
bolivares per dollar. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Petroleum Chamber official] That is correct. That is what I 
just said. The accelerated devaluation rate is unfortunate, but 
if we must choose between having a dollar at a single exchange 
rate of 160 bolivares, which we had before, and what we have 
now, we prefer what we have now. [end recording] 
  According to Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of 
Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry] President 
Edgardo Romero Nava, the foreign exchange allocation system 
implemented by the Central Bank of Venezuela will fail if a 
macroeconomic stabilization program is not implemented. 
  [Begin Romero Nava recording] [Words indistinct] includes 
all 
factors linked to the economy. [passage indistinct]. [end 
recording] 
  It is important to note that according to the (?Dutch) 
method 
implemented by the Central Bank of Venezuela, the issuing bank 
sells the currency [words indistinct] at the highest price so it 
is subject to the forces of supply and demand on the free market. 
  Finally, the Fedecamaras president said he believes that if 
the exchange rate situation continues on it is present course, 
inflation will reach 50 percent by the end of the year.

  [Text] Caracas, 25 May (AFP) -- A tax on luxury items 
(between 10 percent and 30 percent) and wholesale transactions 
(10 percent); a new tax code; reforms to the income tax; and a 
new fiscal stamp law were approved on Wednesday by President 
Rafael Caldera's administration, it was officially reported in 
Caracas. 
  The approval of these taxes and laws complete the package of 
new fiscal mechanisms proposed by Caldera. Part of these 
mechanisms had been approved earlier -- a tax on bank debits 
(0.75 percent) and new laws for the concession of public works 
and for a budget. 
  Caldera received special powers from Congress approximately 
one month ago for the implementation of this series of taxes and 
tax laws. The powers are valid through today and they authorize 
him to issue a decree approving these laws instead of submitting 
them for parliamentary discussions. 
  Upon reporting the approval of these new taxes, with which 
the government expects to overcome this year's fiscal gap -- 
calculated at approximately $6 billion -- Finance Minister Julio 
Sosa said the Venezuelan economy is leaning toward 
stabilization. Sosa also said that the currency could be 
revalued in about two weeks. The bolivar, whose exchange rate 
has dropped considerably for a month, has been devalued 30.93 
percent, and its parity with the dollar is currently 182 
bolivares. Nevertheless, Sosa said that parity could rise to 
150 bolivares in approximately 15 days.

  [Begin Sosa recording] The exchange rate stands at 170

dollar. The bolivar was overvalued in the past, but now we have 
an undervalued bolivar. I think nervousness led a number of

  The finance minister reported that in a meeting today the

including a property tax [words indistinct], a tax on the sale 
of luxury items, and a wholesale tax. The wholesale tax will 
produce (?350) billion [currency not specified] for the national

  Sosa announced that he will travel to Washington on Thursday 
to meet privately with IMF President Michel Camdessus to ask for 
help in restoring confidence in the country.

  [Text] Asdrubal Batista, minister for the reform of the

system will help the price of the dollar stabilize at a lower 
level than that registered in the past days. Batista made this 
statement to Congress, where he was questioned about basic

brewing given the difficult situation Venezuela faces, Batista 
replied: 
  [Begin Batista recording] I do not foresee a situation like 
the social chaos that affected the country. We certainly have a 
new policy, which has only been in effect for a day. We firmly 
hope the dollar will stabilize at a level below the values it 
reached so that there will be no reason to have an excessive 
rise in the price of the dollar. In this context, we must 
remember that volatile forces affect the market, and that 
sometimes they cause situations that go beyond reasonable and 
expected limits. The process is being monitored in a very 
responsible and careful manner to ensure that state mechanisms

  Nevertheless, Batista asserted that the government does have 
a coherent economic policy despite what other national sectors 
say. Batista argued that President Rafael Caldera has not broken 
his commitment of avoiding a sharp devaluation, but 
circumstances have prevented Caldera from complying with his 
goal. Finally, when asked about his dismissal, Batista 
indicated that the president is entitled to choose the 
individuals who he deems will work best with him.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno at Miraflores Palace from the </F>
"Union Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom has issued an 
appeal to the people, urging them to remain alert and report the 
speculation and hoarding that is currently taking place with 
food and medicine. The control mechanisms' inability to curb 
this abuse, which negatively affects the consumer spending, has 
compelled the government to (?seek) ways to control unscrupulous 
businessmen who want to profit from the current crisis in the 
country. 
  Likewise, the interior minister said he is willing to hear 
the community's proposals to cooperate with police authorities 
in the struggle against crime. He referred to the initiative 
adopted by the [word indistinct] Against Crime Movement, which 
he received in his office, [words indistinct] plan actions to 
fight crime. 
  [Begin Escovar recording] I wish to welcome, as interior 
minister, these spontaneous movements organized by civilian 
society, which realizes personal safety is the country's leading 
problem. Some polls show the safety problem is the country's 
leading problem -- 58 percent of Venezuelans believe this is the 
leading problem in the country. This proves the democratic 
maturity many people have because they realize they must 
cooperate and mobilize themselves against violence and crime. 
The government is [words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  The interior minister explained that these groups organized 
as civic movements (?advocate) defending themselves with 
precautionary measures rather than weapons; although [words

Caracas, where student disturbances were reported even though 
the National Guard had occupied the city since early morning, 
according to the national news agency VENPRES. 
  Groups of students set several vehicles on fire and erected 
barricades at strategic points in the city to protest an 
unauthorized fare hike and a failure to apply reduced student 
bus fares. 
  Police spokesmen told AFP that as of noon, there were no 
reports of injuries.

  [Text] Seven Central American countries have just 
participated in a brief summit with U.S. Vice President Al Gore, 
in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, El 
Salvador, Nicaragua, Belize, and Honduras, represented first by 
their foreign ministers and later by their heads of state or 
government, presented a united bloc in the meeting with Gore, 
who had previously announced he would stay for only eight hours. 
As a matter of fact, the brief dialogue that was conducted 
spearheads the summit President Bill Clinton has called for 
December in Miami, as well as the Cartagena de Indias summit in 
Colombia on 14-15 June. 
  With the Miami summit, the United States hopes to initiate a 
new era in its ties with Latin America to eliminate vestiges of 
the Cold War. It has not invited Cuba, however, using the 
pretext of a lack of democratization; or Haiti, although its 
government is recognized by the United Nations and the OAS. 
  It was reported that during the talks between Vice President 
Gore and the leaders of the region, economic and social issues 
were discussed as well as the strengthening of democratic 
institutions, the environment, the war against drugs, and issues 
related to probable economic aid from the U.S. Government. The 
main focus of the summit, however, was getting Al Gore to 
clarify the true possibilities of Central American countries' 
joining the North American Free Trade Accord. The accord, signed 
by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, is bound to become the 
most powerful commercial bloc in the world. 
  Still convalescing from the ravages of almost a decade of 
armed conflict, and short of having consolidated true peace, 
Central America has a population of 30 million people, over 30 
percent of whom live in extreme poverty because the enormous 
economic aid provided the region by the United States was mostly 
consumed by the military in fighting the guerrillas. 
  Central America hoped the Clinton government would clearly 
define its position regarding this region and explain the 
conditions under which commercial negotiations might occur in 
order to later analyze and decide on the prospects of whether to 
move as a bloc or bilaterally, but still united.

Emile Jonassaint by reporter Federico Guevara in Port-au-Prince 
on 24 May; from the "24 Hours" newscast; in French with 
passage-to-passage translation into Spanish -- recorded] 
  [Text] The National Palace in Haiti has a new guest, Emile 
Jonassaint. He spoke to the ECO news enterprise and several 
Latin American reporters on the Haitian situation. 
  [Begin recording] [Guevara] I would like your opinion on the 
international community's stance regarding Haiti. 
  [Jonassaint] The international community acts this way 
because it has been misinformed on what has taken place in 
Haiti. I believe the international community now has precise 
information and that it will change its opinion in the 
not-too-distant future. I occupy this post in response to an 
article in my country's Constitution, which provides that, in 
the case of a vacancy, the president of the Appeals Court shall 
become president. 
  [Guevara] What is your opinion on a possible multilateral or 
unilateral military invasion? 
  [Jonassaint] Haiti cannot fight the international community; 
Haiti does not have the atomic bomb. It is impossible. Haiti 
could be reduced to ashes in a matter of minutes, but we know 
that your country, Mexico, has always rejected any sort of 
military intervention against other states. Mexico has always 
opposed such intervention in other sovereign states. 
  [Guevara] What about the possibility? 
  [Jonassaint] I do not know. They can do whatever they like, 
but I doubt it. Haiti has its protectors. [words indistinct] 
extremely difficult. 
  [Guevara] What will happen in the next few days? 
  [Jonassaint] Only God knows; I am not a fortune teller. [end 
recording] 
  Emile Jonassaint, who was born in 1913 and is 81 years old, 
is perhaps a faithful representative of that 18th century black 
elite -- the old Haitian oligarchy -- where the mixture of 
ancestral popular rites and their very own interpretation of 
constitutionality are clear examples of the enormous 
contradictions that seem more noticeable in this Caribbean 
country.

  [Text] Merida, 24 May (NOTIMEX) -- An official source 
disclosed here today that the Mexican Government hopes the 
current Haitian problem can be resolved peacefully and that 
peaceful options are exhausted in an effort to preclude the use 
of armed intervention. 
  Carlos Ferrer Argote, Caribbean Affairs director of the 
Foreign Relations Secretariat, pointed out that Mexico will not 
interfere in the conflict "because our constitutional principles 
on foreign affairs are based on self-determination and 
nonintervention." 
  Nevertheless, he said the Mexican Government will in no way 
abstain from raising its voice in favor of the Haitian people's 
will being respected. Once the situation in Haiti has been 
normalized, the Mexican Government will direct its international 
cooperation efforts toward the reconstruction of the country. 
  On 21 May, the United Nations implemented a complete embargo 
against Haiti after the expiration of the two-week deadline 
granted to coup leader Raoul Cedras to step down from power and 
allow the return of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
The trade embargo is the most sweeping package of sanctions 
directed against any country on the continent. 
  Within the framework of the 19th Caribbean Studies 
Association, Ferrer Argote stressed that Haiti's problems or the 
conflicts taking place in other countries in the region will 
undermine the integration of the Caribbean States Association. 
He also indicated that Mexico has "definitely" encouraged the 
integration of the Caribbean States Association because there 
must be an ever-growing sense of belonging to the region. The 
Caribbean Affairs director also recalled that 750 km of Mexico's 
coastline faces the Caribbean. 
  The official concluded by indicating that the aforementioned 
integration process has traditionally been hampered by 
inadequate channels of communication. Moreover, he called for 
the construction of a deep draft port in the Caribbean to 
encourage the development of navigation, maritime activities, 
trade, and tourism.

  [Text] Yesterday, the Christian Democratic Party's (PDC) 
rank and file elected a Transitional Political Commission in an 
attempt to politically define this institution and save it from 
extinction. The political commission will have eight members 
instead of the outgoing commission's 15 and will operate until 
November. Its main objective will be to reform the party's 
bylaws. 
  Napoleon Duarte, Jr., Julio Rivas Gallot, Remo Bardi, Ramon 
Sigfredo Jovel, Gustavo Molino, Roberto Giron Flores, Mauricio 
Monico, and Jorge Arriaza form the Transitional Political 
Commission. 
  During this transitional phase, the secretary generalship 
will be replaced by a coordinator who will be elected at the 
commission's first meeting. 
  The outgoing commission was formed by Fidel Chavez Mena, 
Roberto Viera, Atilio Vieytez, Orlando Arevalo, Alfonso 
Aristides Alvarenga, Miguel Espinal, Gerardo Le Chevalier, 
Antonio Morales, Pablo Alvergue, Amanda Villatoro, Antorio 
Torres, Gustavo Salinas, Roberto Serrano, and Arturo Argumendo, 
Jr., [14 names as published] all of whom resigned their 
positions. 
  In addition to electing a transitional commission, it was 
agreed during the party convention to draft a code of ethics and 
discipline for disclosure in September and to schedule a 
doctrine congress in August. Thus, members will have until 30 
July to present collective or individual suggestions for reforms 
to the bylaws. 
  According to Milagro Azcunaga de Melendez of the Movement 
for 
the PDC's Recovery, this convention is only a cosmetic measure 
because it did not take into account the requests the group 
presented. Likewise, the party's youth, who presented their 
criticism at the convention with a pamphlet entitled "Ten Years 
of Decline, Crisis, and Recovery in the PDC," stressed that the 
reforms should be deep, not superficial. 
  The PDC reorganization is part of a series of internal 
changes following the political failure in the past elections.

<F P=106> [Address by President Carlos Menem to open the Constituent </F>
Assembly in the 3 February Theater in Parana, Entre Rios 
Province -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In 1973, on the occasion of 
announcing the three-year plan, General Juan Domingo Peron 
maintained that the aspirations projected for the 21st century 
will have to be written into a new constitution through 
constitutional reform. 
  The opportunity emerges from the political context of the 
current sociological and political situation and from the 
capability of attaining the difficult forging of a 
constitutional consensus. This consensus emerged in 1994. It 
would not have been possible to arrive at this consensus without 
the preceding 10 years of democracy. 
  This honorable Constituent Assembly is the epitome of that 
democracy, and it will be the point of no return between the 
Argentina of fundamental disagreements and the Argentina of 
definite agreements. 
  History has taught us that basic agreements are the major 
force behind the progress of institutions, while fundamental 
disagreements have led to periods of deterioration or regression. 
  We can affirm that a system's political stability is 
directly 
proportional to the degree of agreement reached by its political 
and social forces. The degree of this agreement is what we will 
write into this reform, and history will be implacable when 
judging certain achievements or errors. 
  This honorable assembly has been convened on the basis of a 
popular mandate, a popular mandate that became more and more 
consolidated during the past decade, and it now has been given 
the opportunity of changing history, of making us a participant 
in the most important pages of that history. The opportunity 
arises today and we cannot overlook it. 
  Messrs. Constituent Assembly members: You have been elected 
by the Argentine people to reform and bring up to date the law 
of laws in order to unfold the reform's contents. You have been 
elected by the people to consolidate, through an enlightened 
debate, a debate of ideas, the values of freedom and the 
instruments of democracy. You have been elected as protagonists 
of a time in which history is being written, a time of 
institutionalization, and I repeat: a most important time of 
institutionalization in this century. 
  But you have not been elected to think about present times, 
to remain standing in this historical time, nor have you been 
elected to think about this century. You have been elected to 
think of the future, to think of the Argentina of the 21st 
century, to give the state the necessary judicial and 
institutional instruments with which it can thrive in the times 
we are living and in the times in which we will have to live. 
  History will judge your responsibility. If you succeed in 
your performance, if you can place the interests of the 
fatherland above and beyond any other type of motivation, and if 
you overcome current disagreements by placing the common welfare 
in the forefront, then the future will look upon you with the 
same pride and respect with which today we look upon the 
constituent members of 1853. 
  I do not doubt that this will be so. I do not doubt that 
each and every one of you have alighted on the banks of the 
Parana River, on this river that is a witness to heroic actions 
like that of the Vuelta de Obligado, and are aware of your 
responsibility, of the responsibility given you by 35 million 
Argentines. 
  I know that on this side of the river, you will be 
illuminated by the spirit of Pancho Ramirez. I know that on the 
other side is the remembrance of Estanislao Lopez. Due to their 
passion for federalism, both of these caudillos were fundamental 
pieces in the building of Argentina. 
  The people hope and confide in the revival of that patriotic 
spirit. They hope the democratic system will be consolidated 
with this reform and the balance between the powers of state 
will be perfected; that the organization and functioning of 
justice be strengthened; that the organs of control be 
strengthened; that the federal system be strengthened to enhance 
the economic development and progress of the provinces and 
regions; that Latin American and continental integration be 
favored. They hope, and they have faith, in the debate on the 
points that have been approved by Congress for this honorable 
assembly. They hope a consensus will emerge that will be the 
noblest of our juridical and political culture. 
  Messrs. Constituent Assembly members: As president of the 
Argentine nation and in the name of the people I represent and 
to whom I must respond, I wish to thank all the political 
parties that, above and beyond the position each of them defends 
regarding the reform, made possible the creation of this 
honorable assembly. 
  I wish to thank each of you for the civic courage you 
demonstrated when you assumed such an important historical 
responsibility, with the certainty that you will rise to the 
occasion. 
  If the current reform process concludes successfully, then 
the future development of the new institutions and the best 
balances of power will bury the last vestiges of our historical 
disagreements. 
  It up to this honorable assembly, it is up to you Messrs. 
Assembly members to provide an adequate framework for 
Argentina's entry into the 21st century. 
  Now, I can only ask, as politician and Gen. Justo Jose de 
Urquiza did, that the light of heaven and your love for the 
fatherland illuminate you. God bless you. Thank you very much. 
[applause]

  [Text] La Paz, 17 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Today in La Paz, 
Armed Forces Commander General Fernando Sanjines Yanez revealed 
that after years of investigation, Army intelligence has 
detected indications of the active presence of subversive groups 
in the Cochabamba tropical region. 
  This information was disclosed a few hours after Gen. Guido 
Tavera Leyton, commander of the 7th Army Division, said that 
next month, there will be an "active" presence of military units 
in the tropical regions of Cochabamba Department to verify the 
presence of subversive groups in that zone. 
  In La Paz, Army Commander Gen. Reynaldo Caceres Quiroga 
recently told LOS TIEMPOS that the Armed Forces are carrying out 
antisubversive training daily in Chapare and other parts of the 
national territory. He denied, however, that his command had 
ordered the deployment of members of the Rene Barrientos Ortuno 
and Capitan Victor Ustarez Regiments, which are stationed in 
Tolata and Colomi respectively.

  [Excerpt] Santiago, 23 May (EFE) -- Gutenberg Martinez, 
president of the Chilean Christian Democratic Party [PDC], today 
denied alleged U.S. pressure on Chile to prevent the imminent 
resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba. The leader of 
the main governing party emphatically stated that "we have felt 
no pressure, and if they were to exert any we would flatly 
reject it because we are not going to tolerate any form of 
pressure from anyone, either in favor or against it." 
  In June Martinez will head a PDC delegation to Cuba with the 
purpose of personally learning about the current situation in 
Cuba. 
  Asked about the problems preventing the full restoration of 
diplomatic ties, Martinez answered: "We cannot continue to live 
in the past, either at a national or international level." 
Among these obstacles is the support granted by Cuba to Chilean 
armed groups that struggled against the Chilean military regime, 
especially the massive and illegal introduction of weapons into 
Chile in 1986. Martinez also stated that the current situation 
in Cuba is far from what it was a decade ago and important 
progress can be seen on the island. He commented: "During our 
visit we will see what changes have taken place." After the 
visit, the delegation will give the PDC leadership a report on 
its findings so that the latter may then give the government its 
opinion. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu by </F>
unidentified reporter in Asuncion; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [ABC COLOR] We do not know much about Romania. 
We only know about Dracula and (former dictator Nicolae) 
Ceaucescu. 
  [Vicaroiu] Dracula, Ceaucescu, (gymnast) Nadia Comanecci, 
and 
(tennis player) Ilie Nastase. 
  [ABC COLOR] Of course, there are other well-known names. 
  [Vicaroiu] It is true, little is known about Romania. It is 
understandable because of the great distance separating us. 
Before 1989, Romania was a totalitarian state ruled by 
Ceaucescu. 
  [ABC COLOR] We have heard there are a lot of similarities 
between the Romanian and Paraguayan processes, particularly 
because of their dictatorships, which are now being followed by 
transition processes... 
  [Vicaroiu] We have things in common. Both processes began in 
1989. Both countries have encountered many difficulties in 
their reform processes. We also suffered a lack of capital, 
inflation, the privatization process, social costs... [passage 
omitted] 
  [ABC COLOR] How was Romania's democratization process 
carried 
out? Who participated in it? 
  [Vicaroiu] The main protagonists were those involved in the 
events. They organized a sort of provisional government. A 
strategy was drawn up immediately after the revolution for the 
radical transformation of Romania based on democratic values. 
  [ABC COLOR] What did that strategy involve? 
  [Vicaroiu] We drafted a new Constitution using the technical 
assistance of experts from the most democratic countries in the 
world. Then we worked out specific legislation on market 
economy and began a process to eliminate all state intervention 
in productive activities. We also distributed land among the 
peasants. 
  [ABC COLOR] What happened with Ceaucescu's former government 
officials? The fall of the dictator must have looked like a ray 
of sunlight in an area of eternal darkness. 
  [Vicaroiu] Some went their own way during the privatization 
process, others retired with pensions, while some others are 
participating in the construction of democracy because the 
people were not responsible for what happened. 
  [ABC COLOR] What do you mean by that? 
  [Vicaroiu] In Romania, by contrast to what happened in 
countries around it, the Communist Party was more like a labor 
union. It had more than 4 million members who paid money in 
exchange for a secure job. [passage omitted] 
  [ABC COLOR] How does the reform process affect the 
population? 
  [Vicaroiu] The reform had a very high social cost, just like 
in any country going through a transition process. We have a 
comprehensive program to reorganize and privatize the Romanian 
economy. We have already finished the privatization of 
agriculture. The privatization of industry is ongoing. 
  [ABC COLOR] How many companies have been privatized? 
  [Vicaroiu] To give you an idea, during the process we 
created 
some 380,000 companies with private capital. Of these, some 
70,000 companies are based on foreign capital. So far we have 
privatized hundreds of state-owned companies. 
  [ABC COLOR] Were the privatizations traumatic? 
  [Vicaroiu] We experienced a very difficult economic crisis. 
When my government took over in November 1992, Romanian industry 
was operating at 50 percent capacity. We introduced a series of 
financial and monetary measures and started privatizing. The 
decline stopped. In 1993, growth resumed. Agriculture has 
grown 12.4 percent. We have launched a complex price, trade, 
and foreign exchange liberalization process. 
  [ABC COLOR] How did the population react? 
  [Vicaroiu] We have very strong unions, perhaps the strongest 
in Europe. Union members agree with the reform process, in 
principle. But they also organize street demonstrations, 
strikes... 
  [ABC COLOR] Union members organized a strike here this 
month, 
demanding "no to privatizations..." 
  [Vicaroiu] That is not the Romanian workers' position. 
Unions are in favor of privatizations, but they naturally want 
higher salaries, lower prices, more jobs... 
  [ABC COLOR] Are salaries freely negotiated? Do you have a 
minimum salary? 
  [Vicaroiu] Salaries are freely negotiated between managers 
and union leaders according to the financial possibilities of 
companies. Our unions are not violent. We are in constant 
discussion... 
  [ABC COLOR] What is your strategy to attract foreign 
capital? 
  [Vicaroiu] Romania has aggressive new policies. One of the 
essential conditions to overcome the crisis is to develop 
bilateral relations with every nations in the world. 
  [ABC COLOR] Has the new democratic government spent more on 
foreign relations, defense, interior affairs, or education? 
  [Vicaroiu] According to the budget, the state is only 
responsible for financing infrastructure works, such as 
highways, telecommunications, railways, ports, free trade 
zones... 
  [ABC COLOR] How interesting is Paraguay for Romania? 
  [Vicaroiu] We are very interested in Paraguay and Latin 
America. We are of Latin origin. We have things in common: the 
language, civilization, traditions. We have complementary 
economies and common economic potentials. 
  [ABC COLOR] In what are you specifically interested? 
  [Vicaroiu] Traditional products like cotton, soybeans, 
ferrous minerals, and beef. 
  [ABC COLOR] What can Romania offer Paraguay? 
  [Vicaroiu] A great variety of industrial products like 
planes, helicopters, ships, machines, and tools. We can also 
offer textile, chemical, and fertilizer factories, and different 
types of furniture, oil refineries... 
  [ABC COLOR] It is known that Paraguayan products end up in 
former Communist countries, but deals are always made through 
countries like Brazil. 
  [Vicaroiu] That will change. We can build a good furniture 
factory here. We are the best in the world. Why can we not 
install an urea factory in this country? We can make things 
easier for businessmen. 
  [ABC COLOR] How does Romania compare with its competitors in 
the manufacture of machines, tractors? 
  [Vicaroiu] We are exporting to the United States. 
  [ABC COLOR] Are Romanians interested in investing in 
Paraguay? 
  [Vicaroiu] I am accompanied by more than 40 businessmen. We 
have already signed some contracts. Each one must make a 
profit... 
  [ABC COLOR] Can you balance your visit? 
  [Vicaroiu] Well, first, President Ion Illescu has officially 
invited President Juan Carlos Wasmosy to visit Romania. 
Meanwhile, we expect businessmen to negotiate new investments. 
We also expect to receive Paraguayan congressmen and 
businessmen.

  [Text] Army Commander in Chief Lieutenant General Daniel 
Garcia has praised the restructuralization of the Armed Forces 
ordered by the executive branch. He said the changes will 
improve the Armed Forces' performance, thus helping to 
"guarantee the security of the democratic institutions." 
  Garcia gave a speech yesterday morning during a ceremony to 
commemorate Army Day. The ceremony took place in the Army 
square and was attended by President Luis Alberto Lacalle and 
the cabinet. 
  The anniversary of the battle of Las Piedras was 
commemorated 
during a ceremony that took place during the afternoon in the 
town of Las Piedras, and which was also attended by President 
Lacalle. Mayor Jose Andujar gave a speech in which he defended 
the amendment of the Constitution through a plebiscite that will 
be held in November. 
  During the ceremony in the Army square, Garcia said the 
Armed 
Forces' restructuralization plan attained "a better use of 
human, material, and financial resources, which is something 
essential for the performance of a modern Army." 
  Among the measures that were adopted, he pointed out the 
staff reduction in the Army General Command, Staff, and 
Administrative Support Command, several of whose members were 
reassigned "to field positions." 
  The objective, he said, is to "concentrate the basic units 
in 
the large elemental tactical units by carrying out the necessary 
studies and coordination to modernize and readapt them." 
  After listing the many changes made in the force, he said 
the 
improvement of the efficiency, modernization, and readaptation 
of the Army "will, in the future, allow the Army to efficiently 
comply with its basic traditional mission of defending our 
independence, peace, territorial integrity, Constitution, and 
the laws within our specific jurisdiction, and will contribute 
to guaranteeing the security of the democratic institutions, 
which we hereby reaffirm." 
  In conclusion, Garcia said he is sure that "we are heading 
toward a more efficient and professional Army in which unified 
thought and action are and will be our line of action to attain 
our basic objectives."

<F P=106> [By Gregorio Salazar] </F>
  [Text] Judging from unofficial yet reliable information 
circulating yesterday among journalists at Miraflores Palace, 
Cesar Quintini Rosales, transportation and communications 
minister, will not be the only one to leave President Rafael 
Caldera's executive team. 
  Quintini will reportedly be joined by Development Minister 
Luis Carlos Palacios; Ciro Anez Fonseca, agriculture and 
livestock minister; and Roberto Perez Lecuna, environment and 
natural renewable resources minister 
  Development Minister Palacios has apparently followed the 
government's general guidelines in the commerce and industries 
sector, and certain people say the tendency will be to fall back 
and return to subsidies. Labor unions have criticized the 
minister, and it is believed that he is trying to absorb 
organizations like the Institute for Consumer Education and 
Protection (IDEC) and the Institute for Business Competition. 
  No one knows if the minister's problems stem from actions 
taken by his brother. Rumor has it that the minister's brother 
went to the Institute for Business Competition and demanded that 
the organization change its decision to prevent the merger of 
Heinz and Yukery "because he is the minister's brother." 
Environment Minister Perez Lecuna has been forced to face the 
critical problem created by the water shortage. The extended 
drought has spread a desperation among the people that has not 
been seen in many years. Nevertheless, there is no information 
on any errors or omissions on the minister's part that could 
serve as the basis for his removal. 
  As for the agriculture and livestock minister, organizations 
like Fedeagro [National Federation of Agricultural-Livestock 
Producers], Fedenaga [Venezuelan Cattlemen's Federation], and 
Fedenaca [Peasant Union] have demanded Ciro Anez Fonseca's 
removal, bitterly complaining about the minister's inability to 
act as a mediator to renegotiate the 143 billion bolivar debt in 
the agriculture sector and obtain a higher preferential rate to 
finance this year's harvest. 
  Cesar Quintini Rosales' problems in the Transportation and 
Communications Ministry are well known. They began with the 
resignation of deputy minister Rafael Iribarren, who reported 
the existence of corrupt groups supported by high-ranking 
officials. Quintini is not alone. Rumor has it that he is 
supported by Hugo Perez La Salvia, a member of the commission 
conducting the investigation of Iribarren's charges, the results 
of which remain unknown. Journalists report that he was fired, 
but yesterday Quintini denied dismissing him.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of "exclusive" interview with President Cesar </F>
Gaviria by ``special correspondent'' Pablo Biffi in Gaviria's 
office on 24 May; copyrighted by CLARIN] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Biffi] When Colombian drug 
trafficker Pablo Escobar escaped from jail in 1992, it was said 
the United States had been preparing his abduction ... 
  [Gaviria] No, I do not believe the United States wanted to 
abduct Pablo Escobar in violation of a Colombian legal order. 
As I have already said, Escobar escaped thanks to his huge 
power to corrupt. He escaped because we prevented him from 
pursuing his criminal activities from jail. Colombia did away 
with Escobar and may yet defeat drug trafficking. 
  [Biffi] You have restored diplomatic relations with Cuba. As 
OAS secretary general, will you promote Cuba's reintegration 
into the OAS? 
  [Gaviria] On an issue like Cuba, the OAS secretary general 
may not adopt an attitude different from that of other members. 
Nevertheless, I believe there is a perception in America that we 
can encourage Cuba to implement economic and political changes. 
This involves their opening to other social segments and 
holding elections the way we understand them in other countries 
so that Cuba may rejoin the inter-American system. 
  [Biffi] Are these changes a nonnegotiable condition for 
Cuba's reintegration into the OAS? 
  [Gaviria] It may be perceived in our continent that if Cuba 
takes these steps, its reintegration may be possible. Likewise, 
if Cuba does not take these steps, its reintegration would be 
somewhat difficult. 
  [Biffi] The United States has threatened military 
intervention in Haiti. Would you support this type of measure? 
  [Gaviria] I can only express my opinion as president of 
Colombia as I must be cautious because I will encounter this 
problem as OAS secretary general. Our country's policy has 
always been to exercise full diplomatic and economic pressure on 
Haiti's de facto government seeking the reinstatement of 
democratically elected President Jean Bertrand Aristide in his 
post. We have never made a decision on military intervention 
because we have never had to make such a decision in the OAS or 
in the United Nations. Therefore, we have not taken a position 
on this issue because we are convinced that diplomatic and 
economic pressures may yield results.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Domestic Security''] </F>
  [Text] The decision by the executive branch to establish a 
secretariat in charge of domestic security sparked off the 
heated controversy within the federal government that has been 
so lavishly reported over the last few days. 
  First reports stated that the new secretariat would directly 
report to the Presidency of the nation and would control all 
national security forces. This means that the Federal Police, 
the National Border Police, and the Coast Guard would all come 
under this new secretariat. Its official name would allegedly 
be the Secretariat for Community Protection and, according to 
what has been officially disclosed, it would be headed by Julian 
Licastro. 
  Subsequent reports stated that some members of the cabinet 
are against the all-encompassing role that the government 
intends to give this secretariat. They suggest that the 
National Border Police and the Argentine Coast Guard continue 
under the jurisdiction of the Defense Ministry. 
  Those who support the first position -- the one that 
encompasses all agencies without distinction -- contend that it 
would be more suitable to unify the management of the nation's 
security forces and to coordinate their respective intelligence 
services to enable a greater control of government domestic 
security spending and the optimum use of resources for drug 
enforcement. 
  Those in favor of the second position argue that it is not 
necessary to unify the management of security forces because 
there is already a unified command -- that vested in the 
president of the Republic, under whose natural command come all 
the government's agencies in one way or another. It is also 
alleged that the project for unification contradicts several 
laws (internal defense and security, among them) and that it 
ignores the fact that the Border Guard currently carries out 
external security functions in addition to its task of internal 
security. It is stressed that the creation of the super 
secretariat could lead to an exaggerated concentration of power 
in one branch of government and that it could encourage the idea 
of the intention to create a repressive structure, which does 
not coincide with the style and stamp of democratic societies. 
  Whether these arguments are valid or not, the proposal does 
not seem to follow an imperious need at the present time. The 
internal security problems facing Argentine society do not come 
from the fact that the respective organizations are not in their 
correct positions within the state's current organizational 
chart, but from other factors, some of which have been 
frequently mentioned in this column: The lack of budget 
resources for the sector, the ever-increasing deterioration of 
police professionalism, and the obvious fissures in the judicial 
system, among others. 
  Nothing presupposes a change in the jurisdictional aspect of 
the organizations will help to correct the endemic weakness of 
the national security system or help to attenuate in some way 
the feeling of a lack of protection that Argentine society is 
experiencing in the face of an upsurge in crime and uncontrolled 
drug trafficking. 
  One error that most governments have committed stems from 
the 
presumption that problems can be resolved by the creation of new 
and enormous state structures. Experience shows that this 
formula generally leads to a completely useless expenditure or 
to the overlapping of organizations with similar or parallel 
missions. 
  Internal security is, without a doubt, one of the 
fundamental 
values that the state must safeguard, but the right way is not 
through atypical organizational mechanisms; it is through the 
good use of existing structures and the removal of the obstacles 
that prevent its efficient functioning. The Interior and 
Defense Ministries have clearly established missions and 
functions. If for some reason they are not carrying them out 
with the necessary efficiency, then the needed adjustments and 
behavioral changes must be made so that the organizations can 
face the needs of society today with adequate moral and 
technical competence.

  [Text] Fiber optics, digital telephone exchanges, antennas 
for satellite communications ... the first world of 
telecommunications is not far off. Actually, it is located in 
Campinas, Sao Paulo, where the Telebras [Brazilian 
Telecommunications Inc.] Research and Development Center (CPqD) 
has been operating for 18 years. In partnership with 
universities and industries, the CPqD does applied research, 
which helps the Telebras System save $2 billion per year. 
  The CPqD's 1994 budget amounts to $113.3 million -- the 
highest one since its establishment. Is so much investment 
worthwhile? CPqD Managing Director Leoncio Rezende Neto answers 
affirmatively. "Our cost-benefit ratio is 2,000 percent, much 
higher than any other activity," he said. 
  Besides promoting the technological enhancement of the 
companies operating in the Telebras System, i.e. 
government-owned telephone companies, the CPqD develops products 
and transfers them to industry. Royalties [preceding word in 
English] from these transfers have already greatly exceeded $11 
million. "We study everything, but we do not produce everything 
since we also try to establish the appropriate conditions to 
absorb foreign technology. There is no xenophobia," he said.

  [Text] On 19 May, Jose Altino Machado, businessman and 
leader of the gold prospectors, said all the gold miners who 
were prospecting illegally at the Venezuelan border already have 
left that region. He reported, however, that 11 of them are 
missing and that the two Brazilians detained in Puerto Ayacucho 
were taken to Caracas on 19 May. 
  According to Machado, the decision to leave the region was 
made by the Federation of Legal Amazon Region Gold-Prospectors 
(USAGAL), an organization he heads. About 300 gold prospectors 
have gathered in Pista do Mineiro in Brazilian territory and are 
being transported in light airplanes to Boa Vista. 
  Machado is surprised that Venezuela is bombing only the 
border area when in Venezuela there are more than 16,000 
Brazilian gold prospectors working without harrassment. He said 
those Brazilians have prerogatives because they contribute money 
to politicians and police. He added: "That is very good for the 
pockets of some Venezuelan officials." 
  Machado believes this is the reason Venezuelan officials 
want 
to try him, to make illegal gold prospecting a personal issue. 
Machado is willing to go to Caracas if his right to defense and 
guarantees for his physical safety are assured.

  [Text] Brazil is betting on space conquest. In the 
beginning of 1995, the National Institute of Space Research 
(INPE) in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo State, will put a 
second Data Gathering Satellite (SCD) into orbit. If everything 
runs smoothly, it will launch the first Brazilian communications 
satellite in 1996. Thus, Brazil will be the Latin American 
leader in a scarcely exploited field: cellular telephone systems 
supported by satellites. 
  The INPE is an island of prosperity in a country where 
investment in science and technology has been decreasing each 
year. With a budget of only $1 billion and the promise of $180 
million in supplementary credit, the Science and Technology 
Ministry has to define priorities. The space race is one of 
these priorities. The ministry's budget represents only 0.7 
percent of the Brazilian GDP. This is very little in the face of 
Brazil's needs."We had to define priorities and one of them will 
undoubtedly be the space program," said engineer Oskar Klingl, 
Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas' chief of 
staff. 
  On 19 May, INPE Director General Marcio Barbosa, engineer, 
exhibited in Cachoeira Paulista, in interior Sao Paulo State, 
INPE's main achievement: a NEC SX3/12R supercomputer. It was 
purchased for $20 million and can process 3.2 billion operations 
per second. This supercomputer will be used in the weather 
forecast complex. "We will be able to forecast the 
metereological conditions five days ahead with 70 percent 
accuracy," Marcio Barbosa reported. He said the current system 
only forecasts the metereological conditions 24 hours ahead. 
  According to Barbosa, the supercomputor will have a great 
impact on agriculture, civil defense, recreational activities, 
and tourism. Not everything is positive, however. At the 
national level, Klingl admits that the ministry has been losing 
experts, who join private companies as a result of the low 
salaries being paid to scientists. He added that there should be 
more investment in science and technology, particularly, by the 
private sector.

  [Excerpt] On 23 May, Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero began 
to train entrepreneurs for the fixed exchange rate system that 
will follow the implementation of the real. He said he is 
concerned about the consequences the new system will have for 
exports. The minister mentioned studies on taxation 
modifications and anti-dumping laws, without giving, however, 
any concrete details. 
  At Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries in Sao Paulo, 
Ricupero said "what in the past was compensated for with an 
exchange rate adjustment, should now be compensated for with 
more efficiency and productivity, and this calls for greater 
efforts from entrepreneurs." The economic team has already 
decided to adopt a fixed exchange rate system. When addressing 
the entrepreneurs, however, the minister preferred to use the 
expression "stable exchange rate. Fixed is a strong word 
because as physics has demonstrated, there is nothing fixed in 
the world. In a stable economy, there is no reason for the 
exchange rate to be unstable." 
  Yesterday, Ricupero adopted a more categorical position on 
the economic plan: "We are betting strongly on the stability of 
the currency and the economy," he said. He refused to debate 
the inflation rate in real value units or to make any forecast 
about it: "These are hypotheses that predict failure." [passage

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Change of Course"] </F>
  [Text] The election of metal workers union leader Vicente 
Paulo da Silva, or Vicentinho, to head the Sole Workers Central 
(CUT) represents an important renewal in the Brazilian labor 
movement. The decision not to involve the labor central in PT 
[Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva's presidential campaign is not the only difference 
separating the new leadership from the aggressive political 
stance adopted by Jair Meneguelli for the past 11 years. 
  Vicentinho has confirmed the opinion of political scientist 
Francisco Weffort of the PT, who "opposes corporatism." During 
an interview with JORNAL DO BRAZIL, the new CUT president, 
following the evolutionary line of the Brazilian labor movement, 
defended his independence from the state and the need to end the 
compulsory labor tax. 
  The compulsory contribution is inherited from Getulio 
Vargas' New State interventionist policies. The labor policies 
implemented by Vargas were inspired by Mussolini's fascist Carta 
Del Lavoro and have influenced Brazilian labor legislation. 
Through the labor compulsory tax, his policies prompted the 
creation of both workers unions and managers unions. 
  The subordination to and tutelage of the state was the 
greatest contradiction in a labor movement that is trying to be 
modern and at the vanguard of Brazilian workers' thinking. By 
suggesting that the CUT and affiliated unions should exist on 
the voluntary contribution of their members, Vicentinho 
introduced a risk component that must be extended to other 
workers' federations and managers' unions. 
  The compulsory contributions of million of private workers, 
public servants, and public company employees, which today 
dominate the CUT, have been the main source of workers and 
managers unions' economic and political power. Thus, it was not 
strange to see acrid and even mortal disputes over these 
considerable funds. 
  We must also note that the decision of the new labor leader 
follows a Progressive Renewal Party proposal to create a 
Congressional Investigating Committee to investigate CUT and PT 
relations and the origin of the resources of the labor central. 
By what authority does the PT condemn contributions by 
managers' unions and companies to political campaigns if the CUT 
maintains direct links with PT candidates? 
  The new order within the CUT does not preclude 
investigations 
into past activities. The CUT is the most powerful of the four 
national labor federations. It embodies 2,235 urban unions and 
741 rural unions, representing approximately 18 million workers 
and has an annual budget of $11 million. The labor movement 
needs to control its economic and political power and, 
particularly, to prepare for the possibility of no longer being 
in the opposition, but ready to become part of the ruling class. 
  The end of compulsory contributions will not rid the 
Brazilian labor movement of fascist attitudes. It will also be 
necessary to end the practice of deciding on strikes in 
assemblies where only the most radical elements are represented. 
Vicentinho wants more democratic assemblies and condemns the 
practice of calling general strikes in public administrations 
without very good reason. He suggests alternatives such as 
strikes in key areas of a factory to stop the production process 
without forcing everyone to stop work. 
  The Federal Supreme Court ruled that strikes will be illegal 
in public service companies until Congress regulates Article 37 
of the Constitution permitting strikes by public servants. This 
and Vicente Paulo da Silva's presence at the head of the labor 
central that rules over state companies' workers unions should 
trigger changes in the labor movement. The new CUT president 
has already said Brazil must not look merely inside, adding that 
public workers must also realize that a wave of productivity and 
efficiency is sweeping the world today.

  [Text] Havana, 26 May (PL) -- Today's issue of GRANMA 
describes as insulting U.S. President William Clinton's message 
on 20 May on the occasion of one of the most lamentable moments 
in Cuban history. 
  Under the title of "Pharisaism," journalist Felix Pita 
Astudillo recalls that on the day the United States installed a 
government in Cuba following military intervention, and now, 92 
years later, this country intends to maintain annexationist 
ideas "with the intention of annexing us into its new world 
order at any cost." 
  After pointing to the crudeness of the message's content, 
which seems more like an electoral diatribe directed at Miami -- 
in November, Floridians will go to the polls -- Pita Astudillo 
assesses in detail each of the four paragraphs that "the 
arrogant superpower produced to express its opinion about 
today's Cuba and to disseminate the unsolicited opinions of its 
government." 
  The Cuban Government daily cites statistics that reflect the 
situation in the country prior to the 1959 revolutionary 
victory, and it notes that the Cuban people are not interested 
in the freedom advocated by the United States "because it is 
inhuman and belongs to the every-man-for-himself philosophy." 
  Further on, the journalist notes that the wishes expressed 
by 
Clinton do not take into account "the right to life, work, 
education, food, health, or housing" in Cuba or in its 
neighboring Latin American countries. 
  "There is no reference, at all, to the eradication of 
poverty, which requires well-balanced economic development and a 
better distribution of wealth because it only deals with age-old 
and worn- out references to individual civil liberties with a 
vague mention of the state of law," Pita Astudillo adds. 
  The article describes the argument in the third paragraph as 
cynical because it defends the blockade, a blockade that "is 
aimed at making it impossible for the people of Cuba to attain 
prosperity and satisfy their basic needs as well as making us 
surrender through hunger." 
  President Clinton's message, the journalist adds, indicates 
that Cuba and the United States "have a long history of 
cooperation and admiration." It is indeed long, Pita Astudillo 
remarks, but filled with voraciousness and disdain toward the 
"immoral dwarfs," as the North Americans used to describe Cubans 
in the last century. 
  Describing it as having the nerve to refer to Jose Marti as 
someone whose ideas are consistent with Clinton's policy, Pita 
Astudillo recalls that it was precisely Marti who, 105 years 
ago, wrote: "The United States has never viewed Cuba as anything 
but a savory possession whose only inconvenience is its people, 
whom they view as impetuous, lazy, and loathsome." 
  After noting that President Clinton had an opportunity not 
to 
endorse this shameful part of history, the journalist emphasizes 
with certainty that "there is something between us," adding that 
two different worlds separate us: one of policies of conquest 
and annexation and one of policies of friendship and hospitality. 
  "We are an educated, friendly, and hospitable people, who 
also can be fierce and intransigent when our most beloved 
symbols are insulted with the language of pharisaism, and this 
is the language used in this message," Pita Astudillo concludes.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 25 May (PL) -- The hasty dialogue held 
this week between the Central American presidents and U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore left a balance of conditions and promises that 
were well below expectations. 
  In many respects, the topics discussed were more of interest 
to the United States than to Central America, an area that is 
still suffering from the effects of 10 years of civil war and 
extreme poverty. 
  For the six heads of state who attended the event last 
Tuesday, the dialogue with Gore was primarily aimed at 
determining the White House's position on the possibility of 
Central America gaining access to the NAFTA signed by the United 
States, Mexico, and Canada, which has been in effect since 1 
January. 
  The economic bloc with the most potential in the world 
emerged from this agreement, and access to it has become a sort 
of obsession for most governments in Latin America. 
  According to Gore, however, the Tegucigalpa mini-summit was 
intended to prepare for the hemispheric summit to be convened by 
President Bill Clinton in Miami in December. 
  Revived by Clinton, these types of meetings were suspended 
by 
Washington in the 1960's and are reemerging today, when 
defensive and vindictive strategies for the Ibero-American 
summit are being consolidated. 
  Predictions became realities in Tegucigalpa. Gore downplayed 
any possibilities for short- or medium-term links between 
Central American countries and NAFTA. 
  U.S. analysts commented a few weeks ago that countries with 
key raw materials or with strategic geographical positions, like 
Chile and Venezuela, would now be among the few nations with 
which Washington would be willing to negotiate a link to the 
agreement. Obviously, Central America does not fall into that 
category. 
  Instead of access to NAFTA, the U.S. vice president offered 
the Central American presidents "a program that would provide 
similar NAFTA treatment for textile products coming from the 
Caribbean basin that could comply with NAFTA regulations. Such 
a prerogative would eliminate tariffs for some $3 billion in 
Central American exports to the U.S. market per year. 
  Gore said, however, that for the countries to benefit from 
this program, to be discussed in the U.S. Congress in the next 
few days, the Central American nations would be forced to expand 
their domestic markets for the entrance of U.S. textile products. 
  According to Gore, this plan is Clinton's reply to the 
existing concerns in Central America regarding the economic 
effects that could be brought about by NAFTA, and it definitely 
dashes Central America's hopes of having closer ties to the 
trade bloc. 
  The serious foreign debt problem, however, which has 
absorbed 
so many resources from Central America and prevented it from 
undertaking sustainable development, was not analyzed in the 
summit. 
  By the end of 1993, Central America and the Caribbean 
accumulated a foreign debt totalling $36.56 billion. The 
Central American region alone owes a total of $25.6 billion, 40 
percent of which is Nicaragua's, one of the countries most 
seriously affected by civil war. 
  As for this delicate matter, Vice President Gore only said 
the United States would encourage international financial 
institutions to cooperate with the region to overcome the 
problem. 
  What absorbed Gore's attention the most was not the debt 
problem but his interest in dictating the conduct of the 
presidents of the region in matters of human rights, public 
sector corruption, honest elections, and drug trafficking. 
  With a population of 30 million, the Central American 
region, 
so overwhelmed by social injustice and the impunity with which 
the military continues to intrude on the civilian sector, 
urgently needs specific projects that can lead to accelerated 
development rather than political promises. 
  Economic expansion will be the key to consolidating peace 
and 
democracy in the region, but unfortunately, according to some 
observers here, the meeting with Gore did not open wide any 
opportunities for dealing with such urgencies.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Roberto Molina] </F>
  [Text] The golden chimera that the world predicted would 
follow the decreed end of the Cold War compares to the promise 
of a bright future out there, on the horizon, that imaginary 
point whose remoteness increases as we believe we are getting 
closer. 
  These illusions, which vanish almost as soon as they are 
born, constitute the basis of new worries that emerge before the 
international community on the future of the world and the 
danger of the so-called globalization of politics. This is a 
sort of pretension establishing that everyone must act the same 
in accordance with a predetermined script. Those objectives, 
evidently, were always behind the phrase "the new world order." 
  The United Nations, with its current 184 members, could not 
remain detached from this new trend in international politics, 
and soon the practical results of this trend began to be applied 
in the United Nations. Perhaps, the first warning signal to UN 
members came from the Security Council, one of the seven main UN 
bodies, whose major responsibility, according to the Charter 
adopted in 1945, is to look after the preservation of 
international peace and security. 
  The true symptoms of the practical implementation of the new 
order include the lack of transparency in its endeavors, the 
schematization, the routine in the reports of the General 
Assembly, the unofficial consultations behind closed doors among 
its 15 members, and an increase in peace-keeping operations. 
  The leading complaints made by most countries, especially 
those in the Third World, revolve around three aspects: an 
increase in the number of Council members, the elimination or 
the limitation of the use of the right to veto, and a greater 
transparency in its decisions and interrelation with the General 
Assembly. 
  These grievances might appear fair and -- why not -- even 
modest to anyone. A task force, however, created by the General 
Assembly to analyze all aspects related to perfecting the United 
Nations, is involved in a new "diplomatic" battle, as many have 
labelled the situation, a battle consisting of smiling in 
public, playing with words in speeches, and lobbying intensely 
among those with kindred thoughts to impose ideas. 
  None of the five current permanent members of the Security 
Council (the United States, Russia, France, China, and the 
United Kingdom) is willing to relinquish their right to veto, 
judging from their discussions, although the advocates of a more 
democratic new world order, as they are recommending, are among 
them. 
  There is more. While they agree with the rest of the world 
on an eventual increase in the number of members, they argue 
that, for the sake of the organization's efficiency, no more 
than three countries should be added. They are firmly favoring 
Germany and Japan. 
  At least, they are suggesting that the selection take place 
through the so-called kindred groups, a category aimed at 
eliminating the effectiveness of existing regional groups and 
also at undoing the principle of equitable representation by 
geographic areas at every UN specialized agency. 
  As for the veto, many Third World countries are proposing to 
limit its use to cases related to very relevant issues only. 
For instance, Mexico advocated limiting its use to the 
imposition of penalties to those countries that violate 
international order. There are even countries that propose 
adopting a mechanism consisting of two vetoes in order to block 
a resolution. 
  The U.S. position is clear. Karl Inderfurth, alternate 
permanent representative, recently said he is convinced the 
current status quo of permanent members should remain the same, 
even the right to veto. 
  As for the suggestions to curtail or regulate this 
privilege, 
he emphasized that the use of two vetoes, as well as the 
enhancement of procedures under which a veto is unenforceable, 
are unwise solutions to nonexisting problems. 
  In all these discussions, two Latin American countries, 
namely Mexico and Cuba, have maintained clear positions in 
harmony with the opinions of the majority, which favors 
democratic changes within the UN. 
  Ambassador Victor Flores Olea, permanent Mexican 
representative, has been permanently active in the task force. 
He pointed out that the original political circumstances that 
created the right to veto were already surmounted; this is why 
we cannot make the same mistake of granting this right to 
potential new Security Council members. 
  Both Mexico and Cuba agree it is time to eliminate the 
Council's provisional and operational guidelines in effect for 
the past 50 years and support the adoption of permanent 
statutes, including proposals for procedural reforms and methods 
of work. 
  To that effect and due to the increasing number of issues 
being discussed at the Council, many state-members are 
questioning the ever-increasing use of the closed-door method of 
dealing with unofficial issues. 
  This situation is leading the rest of the UN members to have 
a limited knowledge of transcendental peace-keeping and 
international security issues, because secrecy and covert 
agreements have become the rule. 
  Mexico and Cuba maintain that, by opening new channels of 
communication with other UN members and by devising new 
mechanisms for their participation, the Council's authority will 
be enhanced and the states will feel truly committed to and 
responsible for the Council's decisions. 
  The growing trend among the Council members to adopt strong 
measures -- as stipulated in Chapter VII of the UN Charter for 
matters that threaten peace and international security, thus 
failing to exhaust the mechanisms for peaceful solutions to 
conflicts, as stipulated in Chapter VI -- is also worrisome. 
  This is why the United States is more inclined to deploy 
troops to the four corners of the earth and to resort to 
military operations -- an image very removed from the principles 
upon which the United Nations was instituted, precisely as a 
result of the end of the 1945 military actions. 
  It is still not uncommon to listen to hard-line lingo 
uttered 
by some representatives of large countries, even from permanent 
members of the Security Council, without exhausting the arsenal 
of recommendations stipulated by the Charter to seek bargained 
solutions. This behavior proves we are far away from realizing 
the beautifully depicted dreams of the post-Cold War world. 
Seeking equality and the democratic enforcement of 
international law is also a UN goal. 
  For the time being, it is difficult to forecast how the 
Security Council will be redesigned to align itself with the 
reality of our times. It is very clear, however, the path to 
accomplish this goal is not exactly a bed of roses.

  [Text] London, 24 May (PL) -- It was reported today in this 
capital that Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly 
of the People's Government, visited Westminster Palace, home of 
the British Parliament, and toured the historic building. This 
was Alarcon's first event on the official visit he began here 
yesterday at the invitation of the British group in the 
Parliamentary Union. 
  Sources close to the visiting mission have reported that Sir 
Tom Arnold, a conservative deputy and treasurer of the 
British-Cuban group in the House of Commons, one of two houses 
in the British Parliament, hosted the leader of the Cuban 
legislative branch. 
  The Cuban delegation received a detailed explanation of the 
procedures in the House of Commons and then attended a lunch 
hosted by legislator William Rogers, a foreign policy spokesman 
for the Labor Party. The Cuban delegation also visited the 
famous Tate Gallery, where visitors were able to see valuable 
paintings by British artists. 
  Alarcon also spoke with Sir Michael Marshall, president of 
the British Interparliamentary Council, and later he and the 
rest of his delegation went to a dinner hosted by John Ward, 
president of the British group at the Parliamentary Union. 
  According to sources of the Cuban Embassy in London, this 
first day of activities by the Cuban delegation was a clear 
indication of the hosts' satisfaction with the visit, especially 
their interest in knowing about the organization and procedures 
of the Cuban Parliament. 
  Alarcon arrived in London on Sunday in the company of Dr. 
Osvaldo Martinez, president of the Economic Commission of the 
Cuban National Assembly, and Dr. Lidia Tablada, director of the 
National Agricultural and Livestock Health Center. The 
delegation also includes Dr. Ramon Crespo, secretary general of 
the Cuban Health Union, and Juan Alberto Gonzalez, Alarcon's 
assistant. 
  This visit will strengthen relations of friendship and 
exchange between the two parliaments and help develop the 
already prosperous relations between Havana and London, Cuban 
sources said.

<F P=106> ["Cuban Foreign Minister To Conduct Sweeping Diplomatic </F>
Activities" -- PRENSA LATINA headline] 
  [Text] Havana, 24 May (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina will carry out intense diplomatic activities in 
the next few days, beginning with his participation in the 
upcoming conference of foreign ministers of the Nonaligned 
Movement member-states. 
  Robaina will leave for Cairo, the host city, on Saturday. He 
will head a Cuban delegation which, according to Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso, will present specific 
proposals aimed at maintaining the island's active participation 
in the activities of the movement. The meeting will last until 
3 June. 
  From Cairo, Robaina will travel to Qatar, where he was 
invited by the Qatar Government to review bilateral relations 
and assist in the inauguration of the Cuban Embassy there. 
  After returning to Havana for a few days, the foreign 
minister will, on 12 June, assist in a foreign ministers meeting 
that will take place in advance of the Ibero-American Summit, 
which will be held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, and be 
attended by the chiefs of state and government of the two 
regions. 
  Another important trip by Robaina will be one in early July 
that will take him to the installation ceremony for the 
Association of Caribbean States in the capital of Barbados. 
  Speaking to a group of domestic and foreign reporters, 
Alfonso described these trips as part of the "diplomatic 
offensive" Cuba is waging right now. He pointed to the 
continuous increase in diplomatic and consular relations between 
the island and other nations. 
  So far, a total of 147 countries maintain diplomatic 
relations with the largest of the Antillean islands, a situation 
that exposes the lie about Cuba's alleged isolation in the world.

  [Text] Havana, 17 May (PL) -- It was learned here today 
that Cuban physicists are designing a three to six megawatt 
research nuclear reactor. The physicists hope to have the 
nuclear reactor operational by the end of the century. 
  Andres Garcia, secretary of the Nuclear Affairs Executive 
Secretariat, explained to PRENSA LATINA that the project is part 
of a strategy aimed at the gradual advancement of the potential 
in this field that, even though it is seriously affected by 
material shortages, has the scientific capacity for the 
development of this type of technology. 
  The idea of the reactor, Garcia said, is linked to the 
creation of a center for the production of radioactive isotopes 
that should be completed by late this year and that includes, 
among its main objectives, becoming a source of radionuclides 
for medicine and the pharmaceutical industry. 
  We hope 50 percent of the reactor's technology will be 
produced in the country, Garcia added. Garcia said a small 
group of very highly qualified specialists are designing the 
nuclear reactor. 
  From the very beginning, the Cuban nuclear program was 
conceived as a multiphase project and, together with nuclear 
energy (the production of electricity by the fission of an 
atom), the use of radioisotopes and radiation in various fields 
will also be developed. 
  The center for the production of isotopes, located at the La 
Quebrada Research Center in southeastern Havana, is being built 
with the help of Invap S. Emn, an Argentine enterprise 
specializing in that technique. 
  Regarding the construction of the Juragua Electro Nuclear 
Plant, which was being done with the help of the former USSR and 
is currently stopped, Garcia said talks are under way with 
Italian, British, and French companies interested in continuing 
the construction. 
  The Cuban Atomic Center project included the supply of two 
VVER, model V-318, (water pressure) reactors. Each of these 
reactors can supply 417 megawatts of electricity.

  [Text] Havana, 19 May (PL) -- Official actions against 
those who have enriched themselves illicitly will be taken 
seriously and calmly, with emphasis on those who improperly took 
advantage of state goods, a top leader of the Communist Party of 
Cuba [PCC] said today. 
  During a meeting with the Veterans Association, Candido 
Palmero, first secretary of the PCC in the agricultural province 
of Havana, said several cases have been uncovered. Greater 
emphasis will be placed on those who enriched themselves at the 
expense of the state. 
  Explaining the need for Decree Law 149, Palmero noted that 
the struggle against impunity has become a task of the people 
and it will not be implemented in haste. 
  Referrring to cases of illicit enrichment already uncovered, 
he cited the case of a citizen whose eight different kinds of 
transportation and a large amount of money were confiscated. 
  Decree Law 149, promulgated by the executive at the request 
of the Cuban assembly, is among the first official actions 
against the so-called money hoarders, individuals who outrage 
the citizens because of their accumulation of resources obtained 
in a questionable manner. 
  The need to adopt measures against these individuals was a 
continuous proposal during the workers' assemblies, meetings 
held in all work places in the country in the early months of 
1994. 
  Palmero noted that it is the people who have complained 
about 
those who, according to Havana's newspaper TRIBUNA, "filled 
their coffers through speculation, theft, and shady deals."

  [Text] Varadero, Cuba, 18 May (PL) -- Osmany Cienfuegos 
Gorriaran, the recently appointed tourism minister, warned that 
in this dynamic sector of the Cuban economy "there will not be 
any parasols to cover up inefficiency because quality must 
prevail above everything else." 
  Actions must be taken to encourage healthy and necessary 
competition because orderly competition will prevail without 
paternalism nor undeserved support, he said during the official 
welcome speech at the 15th Annual Cuban Tourism Convention. 
This convention will run through Friday [20 May] at this beach 
resort, approximately 140 km east of Havana. 
  After recalling that this traditional encounter coincides 
with important organizational changes in the local tourism 
sector, Cienfuegos stressed that the rules (to obtain sustained 
development) will be efficiency in the economy, excellence in 
the quality of the services, and the professionalism of all 
workers and executives. 
  Cinefuegos noted that the Tourism Ministry will be 
streamlined and that it will not issue mandates nor dictate. 
Instead, it will concentrate on development policies and oversee 
their implementation. 
  He stressed that the ministry will manage Cuban tourist 
services which, at times, have been the victim of bad 
administration. This, he noted, has created a distorted image 
of the industry, and he called on tour operators to comply with 
what has been agreed upon contractually to avoid 
misunderstandings. 
  "In addition to sun and beaches, in general our outdoors, 
our 
history, our culture, and our traditions are fundamental 
elements of the Cuban tourist product," he stressed. 
  He affirmed that the conservation of cities and the 
environment will shape the design of tourist facilities. The 
extended use of the land will not take precedence over its 
rational use and it will not take precedence over nature. He 
noted that a culture of cement will not be created. 
  When referring to job opportunities in the industry, he said 
all the forms of specialized tourism will be explored. The 
development of aquatic sports and golf will quickly open new 
opportunities to fill the void in current inducements to 
vacationers. 
  He also commented on the fact that tourism is not only the 
obligation of the so-called tourist organizations, but it also 
should be the obligation of society as a whole and its 
institutions. 
  In this regard, and without giving any more details, he 
announced the utilization of a tourism council that will include 
participation from various organizations, and he also mentioned 
the enactment of a government law that will regulate this 
sector. In addition, Cienfuegos concluded, a law on the already 
charted coastlines and a code of ethics will be promulgated.

  [Text] Varadero, Cuba, 18 May (PL) -- Tourism Minister 
Osmany Cienfuegos Gorriaran said here today that Cuban 
recreational facilities are able to receive more than 1 million 
visitors. 
  In a news conference at one of the halls of the 
Melia-Varadero Hotel, Cienfuegos explained that the sector's 
infrastructure and personnel are ready to increase the presence 
of vacationers in the next two years. 
  As part of the 15th Cuba '94 Tourism Convention, the 
minister 
met with nearly 120 foreign and local reporters who were given 
detailed information about the reorganization of this economic 
sector in Cuba. 
  He confirmed the presence at this fair of representatives 
from 26 nations, 13 from America, 12 from Europe, and Algeria, 
who is attending for the first time. 
  Cienfuegos reiterated that last year, Cuba earned 
approximately $720 million in gross revenue from tourism, a 30 
percent increase compared to 1992. For 1994, he added, the 
revenue is expected to reach $900 million as a result of greater 
efficiency and better training of personnel. 
  He explained that in the 12 months ending in December, an 
average hotel occupancy rate of 50 percent was achieved, but 
that the new facilities, such as the Melia, have satisfactory 
occupancy rates. 
  The minister described his ministry's structure -- with only 
50 officials -- as compact, adding that it was created under the 
concept of efficiency, which should prevail. 
  He also said that 560,000 tourists entered the country in 
1993. The largest number came from Canada, Germany, Mexico, and 
Spain, indicating that 54,100 arrived from Spain. He compared 
these figures with the plans to reach 1 million visitors in 
1995, adding that tour operators and agencies are focusing on 
that objective. 
  As an element of comparison, he said 20 million vacationers 
visited the Caribbean last year, with a 50 percent distribution 
between hotel installations and cruise ships. He said Cuba must 
become the preferential market in the area, adding that it does 
not plan to compete with its neighbors but to seek regional 
integration.

"In Varadero, `The Best is the Best'"] 
  [Text] Varadero, Cuba -- A luxurious sun caresses the 
tourists who come to this beach resort, which in 1880 was 
absolutely pristine but now has plenty of excellent hotel 
facilities. 
  Those who make repeat visits to the Hicacos peninsula claim 
that here, where the finest sand delights visitors for more than 
20 km, the sun is more than a star. 
  This is also a good place for tourist businesses and this is 
why the Cuban Tourism Convention, which is being held from 16 to 
20 May, every year becomes more significant. The convention has 
been held in Havana, but the so-called blue beach is undoubtedly 
its pinnacle. 
  Seeing visitors walk along the streets of Varadero or travel 
by car toward the end of this narrow sweep of land one might 
think this beach has always been a haven for vacationers, but 
this is not the case. 
  The first luxury hotels emerged in the 1950's following a 
long period of neglect, during which pirates plundered the area 
and only a handful of landowners were present. 
  The Internacional Hotel and some residences of the Kawama 
housing project are the oldest structures enhancing this 
landscape. Around the time these installations were being 
built, the peninsula also began to host Boston-style homes that 
were dismantled in Boston and moved to Varadero. 
  The Ambrosio cave, which contains aboriginal drawings, and 
cays such as Mono Cay where seagulls make annual visits, is in 
Varadero. These and other characteristics make Varadero a 
superb and beautiful destination. 
  [Words indistinct] green branches and glass-walled 
elevators, 
or the back-and-forth journeys of catamarans, yachts, and 
motor-boats cruising the sea. 
  In spite of blistering heat, the 15th Annual Cuba Tourism 
Convention attracted many people to the 464-square meter 
Puntablanca Fair Room. 
  While attending their own exhibition rooms or walking around 
in search of pleasant conversation, businessmen from 88 
commercial firms in 26 countries are informing interested 
journalists from around the world about the possibilities of 
Cuba's nascent tourist industry. 
  Cuba's Tourism Minister Osmany Cienfuegos reported that Cuba 
expects some 1 million tourists in 1995. Many other Tourism 
Ministry officials, however, say they are getting ready to 
receive more than that. 
  The island, which has many other beautiful attractions in 
addition to Varadero, has more than 7,000 rooms available, and 
negotiations are under way so that every year 2,000 new rooms 
become available, according to official reports. 
  There are two especially significant attractions: the 
beaches, or let us say, the landscape; and the people. This is 
what we mean when we say "the best is the best," keeping in mind 
a suggestion by Rene Capriles, a Rio de Janeiro colleague who is 
one of the 85 foreign reporters covering the convention, which 
will close tomorrow. 
  This blue beach located in an area that began to be utilized 
in 1883, when 10 people from the neighboring town of Cardenas 
decided to buy land, today is the standard of Cuban tourism. 
  Many people from that town would have acquired peninsula 
land 
had they foreseen the admiration held for this paradise, which 
today is hosting numerous tourist installations. 
  One gets the impression that without Varadero there might be 
no sun and no warmth anywhere else, when just the opposite is 
true. Varadero has become, perhaps, the standard for multitudes 
of Cuban tourist attractions. This is the reason why all of the 
businessmen at this convention are saying "the best is the 
best." It is true.

  [Text] Havana, 24 May (PL) -- Cuban Tourism Minister Osmany 
Cienfuegos said today that the Sixth International Hall of 
Technology and Products of Tourism Industry, Tecnotour '94, 
represents a significant improvement over past fairs. 
  Ciefuegos dedicated the specialized fair and noted the 
presence of more than 600 firms, -- 155 of them local, from 22 
countries, including Spain, Canada, Mexico, Italy, and Germany, 
which are also the countries whose citizens travel to the island 
the most. 
  The minister said: We hope all tourist and marketing 
enterprises will secure service and supply contracts in this 
sector of the economy during Tecnotour '94. 
  The tourism industry is considered strategic in pulling the 
island out of the economic crisis it has been facing for more 
than four years. 
  Regarding the presence of foreign firms, Cienfuegos noted 
that most of them have relations with Cuba and that the new ones 
are trying to establish them. 
  Shortly after cutting the inaugural ribbon at the exposition 
pavilion in this capital's Convention Palace , Cienfuegos and 
other representatives of the Cuban Government walked through 
part of the 4,680-square meter fair area and spoke with some of 
the exhibitors. 
  He spoke with Eduardo Adam, representative in Cuba of Farma 
Venda, an Italian enterprise that occupies approximately 100 
square meters of the fair exhibiting cosmetics, clothes, 
appliances, and food. 
  At the fair, foreign visitors have the opportunity to talk, 
make contacts, and sign new agreements with Cuban entities. 
Czechoslovakia and Costa Rica are the newcomers to this tourist 
technology round, which will last until 29 May. 
  The Latin America countries with the largest number of 
exhibitors in Tecnotour '94 are Mexico with nine firms; Chile 
with four; Panama with three; Venezuela with two; and Costa 
Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Peru with one each.

minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, praised the work 
done in the area of agriculture by the military youth 
detachments, and he said this is one of the corps of which he is 
most proud. 
  Castro, who is also second secretary of the Communist Party 
of Cuba, made this statement during a tour of three integrated 
farms administered by the Youth Labor Army (EJT) in Havana 
Province. 
  Raul Castro visited the the Kent Martyr labor unit in 
Artemisa Municipality, and the Calderon-El Cedro and La Flor de 
Cuba units in Alquizar Municipality, where he showed interest in 
crop yields, production costs, labor productivity, and rational 
use of fuel and other resources. 
  There, the pass system used by the young soldiers, their 
discipline, and the new organizational methods that have been 
introduced -- such as working in blocs (the concentration of 
manual labor and resources in one unit of land), which permits 
an increase in productivity and the saving of resources -- were 
all explained to him. 
  The Armed Forces minister congratulated the EJT members, as 
well as the civilian agricultural workers who assist them in 
their tasks, for the good results obtained, and he urged them to 
continue their efforts to overcome the difficulties caused by 
the lack of fertilizers and fuels.

  [Text] Havana, 24 May (PL) -- PRENSA LATINA learned today 
that Cuba has taken another step toward normalizing relations 
with Cuban emigrants by creating the Directorate for Affairs of 
Cubans Residing Abroad [Direccion Para los Asuntos de los 
Cubanos Residentes en el Exterior]. 
  The new office reports directly to the Ministry of Foreign 
Relations and has already started to implement agreements 
reached at the recent Cuban emigrant conference, which took 
place last month in Havana. 
  More than 200 Cubans residing in other countries attended 
the 
meeting, which was convened by the Foreign Ministry. They 
discussed ways of securing normal relations with their country 
of origin, despite the reasons that led them to live abroad. 
  Jose Cabanas, a graduate of the Higher Institute of the 
Foreign Service of Cuba, was appointed to head the newly created 
office, whose creation is also a result of the conference 
between the Cuban Government and the participants at the April 
conference. 
  According to sources close to the Foreign Ministry, Cabanas 
is adding the final touches to the first decisions of his new 
office. The decisions will be announced in the coming days. 
  Among the decisions, as announced by Foreign Minister 
Roberto 
Robaina during the recent conference, is the implementation of a 
process for children of the emigrants to study certain 
specialized careers at several Cuban higher education centers. 
  Likewise, there are several decisions that will make it 
easier for Cuban nationals living abroad to travel to the 
island, including the elimination of a provision requiring them 
to pay for reservations at local hotels, which is part of the 
tourism program that has been in place up until now. 
  The Foreign Ministry is planning to set up a publication 
directed at improving information emigrants receive in the 
countries where they live, particularly in the United States. 
Conference participants admitted that this information is 
distorted. 
  Work at the Directorate for Affairs of Cubans Residing 
Abroad 
is directed at implementing these decisions and creating ways to 
expand the contacts initiated with the emigrants.

  [Text] Havana, 18 May (PL) -- Today the Higher Institute of 
Sciences and Technology established an environment department, 
dedicated to the use of nuclear techniques to preserve and 
protect the environment. 
  Headed by Francisco Martinez Luzardo, a forestry expert and 
chemist by profession who holds a doctorate degree in the 
sciences of the use of residues, the department groups 
radiochemists, nuclear physicists, and technologists whose 
interests and research findings are related to the idea of 
sustainable development. 
  Martinez Luzardo told PRENSA LATINA the department will 
promote environmental projects with stress placed on their 
economic feasibility. In addition to conducting a nuclear 
analysis of the industrial waste and atmospheric pollution, the 
department seeks to develop and apply technologies to treat 
residual and natural waters and waters muddied with the waste of 
contaminating metals, as well as to lower the risks of human 
error in operating industrial processes, he explained. 
  The researchers discussed the main achievements in using the 
residues of salt plants, sawmills, and nickel factories and 
referred to the virtues of the products obtained: additives for 
fuel, anticorrosive products, purifying resins, and others. 
  At present, the department is conducting a joint program 
with 
Rio de Janeiro and Roraima Universities in Brazil on the 
protection of the environment, specifically on the use of 
radiotracers [radiotrazadores] to analyze residuals polluted by 
mercury.

  [Text] Havana, 18 May (PL) -- The Union of Military 
Industries has the capacity to ensure the production and repair 
of the light weapons required by the Cuban Armed Forces, General 
Luis Perez Rospide has stated here. 
  The ranking officer heads a complex of factories and 
workshops that has as its primary mission maintaining combat 
weapons in top condition and overseeing the profitability of the 
12 existing enterprises. 
  In 1989, the military industry began a process of 
preparation 
to also take on production necessary for the national economy 
following the disappearance of the Soviet Union with which the 
country had 85 percent of its foreign trade. 
  Replying to a question from PRENSA LATINA, Perez Rospide 
said 
the military industries have the capacity to ensure, with its 
own experts, the repairs of tanks, airplanes, rockets, and other 
equipment necessary for defense, despite the economic 
difficulties the island is facing. 
  In addition to maintaining and modernizing combat weapons, 
the factories and workshops are also guaranteeing light weapons, 
mines, and ammunition, Perez Rospide, a graduate in tank 
engineering, said. 
  Perez Rospide told reporters during a tour of three military 
enterprises, where experts, designers, and a skilled labor force 
work, that 25 percent of its output consists of products in 
great demand among civilians. 
  The production of these enterprises includes safes, 
compressors, industrial refrigerators, wagons, computers for 
medical diagnostics, other equipment useful for tourism, public 
health, and agriculture.

<F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 19 May (PL) -- Today, Colombian ambassador 
to Cuba Ricardo Santamaria emphasized the vigorous development 
of relations between the two countries and predicted that these 
ties will be strengthened in the immediate future. 
  In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Santamaria recalled 
important events that have taken place in the past few hours as 
part of the joint efforts by the two Latin American countries. 
  Yesterday, Camilo Penalosa, Colombia's deputy minister of 
economic development, ended a visit to Cuba in which he led a 
group of businessmen interested in investing in the island. 
There was also the arrival of the Colombian training ship, Arc 
Gloria, which brought a message of friendship to the Cuban 
people. 
  The Colombian and Cuban Civil Aeronautics Directorates have 
also signed an agreement allowing for prompt establishment of 
regular flights, linking their capitals and other cities in the 
two countries. 
  Commenting on the businessmen's visit, Santamaria explained 
that this was a positive step in joint business ventures and 
that it had exceeded expectations, as face-to-face meetings were 
held with people who want to invest in Cuba. 
  He said the businessmen identified specific points of 
cooperation. As part of the next phase of the talks, they 
arranged for a new meeting to be held soon in Bogota with 
ranking Cuban and Colombian officials in order to reach specific 
agreements. He said the visitors exchanged views on prospects 
for Cuba's economy and its future, as well as on new methods of 
foreign investment approved by the Cuban state. 
  The diplomat said this type of visit creates a continuity 
that gives Colombians direct knowledge of the opportunities that 
exist in Cuba to establish ventures beneficial to both countries. 
  The topic of the aeronautics agreement recently signed was 
broached with enthusiasm by Santamaria, who described this as 
the principal object of the diplomatic mission's work in view of 
its economic importance. 
  This is done on the basis of a real market because there are 
clear prospects for scheduling several weekly flights between 
the capitals and other cities in Cuba and Colombia, as evidenced 
by the increase in tourist flights this year, he noted. The 
ambassador noted how increased travel between the two countries, 
not only of tourists but also of businessmen and respective 
government officials, will help strengthen bilateral relations 
between the two countries. This important agreement was reached 
thanks to Cuba's constructive attitude, which can expect of us 
all the loyalty expected of a brother country, he said. 
  Santamaria referred to the negotiations on expanding the 
partial agreement, which would represent a significant increase 
in commercial bilateral ties. To this end, the Colombian 
Government is now consulting with the private sector on tariff 
issues, which would affect over 800 products included in the 
expansion and which were the object of prior agreements during 
the last meeting in Havana. 
  We hope to sign the respective document between the Cuban 
and 
Colombian Foreign Trade Ministries this coming June or July, 
based on the work that has been carried out and the technical 
meetings that have been held, the ambassador concluded.

  [Text] Havana, 19 May (PL) -- Today, Colombian Ambassador 
to Cuba Ricardo Santamaria talked about the existing dynamics in 
the development of the relations between the two countries, and 
he predicted even better relations in the immediate future. 
  Santamaria granted an interview to PRENSA LATINA, during 
which he noted that important events had taken place in the past 
few hours regarding relations between the two Latin American 
countries. 
  Camilo Penaloza, Colombian deputy economic development 
minister, ended a visit to Cuba yesterday. He was leading a 
delegation of businessmen interested in investing in the island. 
The Colombian Navy training vessel Arc Gloria docked in Havana 
Port, bringing a message of friendship to the Cuban people. 
  Moreover, the civil aeronautics directors of Colombia and 
Cuba signed an agreement that will soon lead to the 
establishment of regular flights by their airlines to link the 
capitals and other cities of both countries. 
  As for the visit paid by the businessmen, Santamaria 
explained it represents a specific step forward in the area of 
possible joint business ventures by means of direct meetings 
with the people who are able to invest in Cuba. 
  He also said the business delegation identified specific 
points of cooperation and a new meeting was scheduled with 
high-ranking Colombian and Cuban officials with the goal of 
signing specific agreements. The meeting will soon be held in 
Santa Fe de Bogota as bilateral talks move into their next round. 
  The visitors, he said, held meetings in which they were 
informed of the Cuban economic outlook and the country's future, 
as well as being informed of new types of foreign investments 
approved by the Cuban state. 
  The diplomat said there is going to be continuity in these 
types of visits, which are aimed at providing Colombian 
companies with direct knowledge of existing opportunities in 
Cuba for the establishment of enterprises that benefit both 
sides. 
  Santamaria talked with great enthusiasm about the 
aeronautics 
agreement that has just been signed. He described the agreement 
as the primary goal of the diplomatic mission in view of its 
economic importance. 
  The agreement was based on the existence of actual market 
needs because clear possibilities already exist for having 
several weekly flights between the capitals and cities of Cuba 
and Colombia, as is shown by the increase in the number of 
tourist flights during the current year, he said. 
  The ambassador said the increase in the number of flights 
between the two countries, not only for tourists but also for 
businessmen and government officials, contributes to the 
dynamics of bilateral relations. 
  It is an important agreement that was signed thanks to the 
constructive position of Cuba, which can expect from us all the 
loyalty one can expect from a brother country, he said. 
  In addition, Santamaria talked about the status of the 
negotiations for expanding the partial agreement, which will 
also allow, in the area of trade, a significant increase in 
bilateral relations. 
  To this effect, the Colombian Government is currently 
conducting consultations with the private sector regarding 
tariffs that will affect more than 800 products included in the 
expansion, which were the object of previous agreements in the 
last meeting held in Havana. 
  We hope that in June or July of this year, the Colombian and 
Cuban foreign trade ministers will sign the corresponding 
document based on the work already done and the technical 
meetings that have already been held, the ambassador said.

  [Text] Havana, 18 May (PL) -- PRENSA LATINA learned today 
that a delegation of Colombian businessmen, which just completed 
a visit to Cuba, has discussed the possibility of investing in 
Cuba in the areas of production and services with local 
authorities. 
  A Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation 
(MIECE) source confirmed to PRENSA LATINA that Camilo Penalosa, 
Colombian deputy minister of economic development, headed this 
delegation. 
  The Colombian businessmen identified investment 
opportunities 
in the areas of tourism, the sugar and pharmaceutical 
industries, biotechnology, agricultural sector, and basic 
industry, among others. 
  The visitors initially received ample information during a 
plenary session, which was offered by MIECE representatives, the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Chamber of Commerce of Cuba, 
in which they discussed the ideas presented by the delegation on 
possible joint ventures. 
  The delegation also learned about current legislation on 
foreign investment in Cuba and about preparations for the future 
approval of a law for mutual promotion and protection of this 
kind of business resulting from the development of economic 
links. 
  Members of this business group joined the Cuba '94 Tourism 
Convention which is currently being held at the well-known 
Varadero Beach, about 140 km from the capital, because this is 
precisely the area where there already exist more immediate 
possibilities for bilateral cooperation. 
  Among other activities, the delegation visited the Sugar 
Industry and Finance Ministries and the facilities of the 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. There, they were 
briefed on the country's production efforts and the use of their 
installed capacities. 
  When consulted by PRENSA LATINA, Roberto Rivas, the MIECE 
director for America, described the visit as another step in the 
process of identifying possibilities for joint work and 
expansion of existing links between the two Latin American 
countries. 
  Deputy Minister Penalosa and other businessmen returned to 
their country today, but those who are participating in the 
tourist convention remain on the island.

  [Text] Asuncion ROMPRES, 20/5/1994 -- The documents that 
are going to be signed during this visit "will become the first 
instruments proving a friendship just being born," said 
Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy at a ceremony at the 
Lopez Palace wherein the Romanian prime minister was awarded the 
national order of merit ranked as "Great Cross Extraordinary." 
  Another ceremony took place at the Asuncion mayorship 
wherein 
the Romanian premier was declared "illustrious guest" and was 
given the key to the city. 
  The string of protocolar meetings included Premier 
Vacaroiu's 
attending a solemn session of the National Congress, the 
Paraguayan Parliament. 
  The fact obviously came to the fore from these protocolar 
ceremonies that Premier Vacaroiu's current visit, the first at 
such a level made by a delegation from Central and Eastern 
Europe, represented an opportunity for the development of 
bilateral relations. 
  Referring to the meeting between President Wasmosy and 
Premier Vacaroiu, the secretary-general of the Romanian 
Government, Viorel Hrebenciuc, who is accompanying the Romanian 
prime minister, said "the talks have proved the usefulness of 
the Romanian delegation's visit in assisting the Romanian 
businesses to penetrate these markets. 
  Prime Minister Vacaroiu delivered to the Uruguayan President 
Wasmosy an invitation to visit Romania on behalf of the Romanian 
president. 
  The meeting focussed on economic matters, opportunities of 
cooperation in various domains, especially power engineering and 
transport. Also, considering the very big Paraguayan deposits 
of phosphates and methane and the cotton resources, cooperation 
will be possible in chemistry, fertilizers, urea and ammonia, 
cement, light industry and furniture. 
  The same forms of cooperation were referred to also during 
the talks of the Romanian ministers of industries and trade with 
their Paraguayan counterparts, who also analyzed the possibility 
of new multilateral actions. Paraguay may become for Romania a 
turntable to the countries in the region. It is a member of the 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South], an economic space 
counting over 200 million consumers. In this context, the 
opening is planned for next year of a Romanian trade office in 
Asuncion.

<F P=106> [DESCO ``Special Report'' No. 35: "Political Violence in </F>
Peru Today," issued by Peru's Center for Development Studies and 
Promotion (DESCO)] 
  [Text] During March 1994, political violence increased 
slightly, compared to the months of January and February. There 
were 43 attacks on persons, or 10 percent more than in January 
(when there were 34) and February (when there were 32). 
Fortunately, there was a considerable decrease in the number of 
persons killed. The attacks in March caused 17 deaths. Twelve 
involved presumed subversives, four were civilians, and one was 
a member of the armed forces. 
  Lima continued to be the area where the largest number of 
subversive actions took place. A total of 27 (63 percent) of the 
attacks took place here. In March, two periods of time were 
preferred for subversive activity: the middle and the end of the 
month. Shining Path [SL] carried out two waves of attacks, 
including a series which took place during two weeks in the 
middle of March as part of a "subversive celebration" to 
commemorate two anniversaries: the attack on the CRAS [Social 
Rehabilitation Center--after prison training center] in Ayacucho 
and the establishment of Socorro Popular [People's Assistance 
Organization, the SL equivalent of the Red Cross]. The wave of 
attacks which took place during the last few days of March 
involved a series of actions in anticipation of the anniversary 
of the coup d'etat of 5 April. 
  Most of the attacks in Lima involved acts of sabotage 
against 
branch banks, supermarkets, and high voltage electricity pylons. 
The most serious action, however, involved the detonation of a 
tricycle bomb in the home of Patricio Ricketts, a journalist. 
  In second place in terms of acts of political violence was a 
three-way tie between the subversives' Principal, Norte, and 
Centro [Principal, North, and Center] regions. Four attacks (9 
percent of the total) took place in each region. 
  In the Principal region, there were three raids on towns in 
the Province of Acobamba and an act of terror in the Province of 
Huancasancos in which the governor of the province was wounded. 
  In the Norte region, subversives attacked the local 
headquarters of a company which repairs highways, murdered a 
local official, and incited a mob to lynch a group of farmers. 
Finally, two members of the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement] were captured when they attempted to break into a 
house. 
  In the Centro region, there were two clashes, one of them 
initiated by the Army and the other by indigenous people of the 
Ashaninka tribe. At the same time, subversives sabotaged 
electric lines in the Valle del Mantaro area. 
  In third and last place, a tie was also recorded between the 
Regional Committees of La Selva and Sur, with two attacks each 
(5 percent of the total). 
  In La Selva region, there was a clash and a deliberately 
targeted murder, whereas in the Sur region there was also a 
clash in Orurillo, Province of Puno. The subversives detonated 
explosives against a special project. 
  Regarding persons killed, the leading area was the Centro 
region, with 13 persons killed (72 percent of the total). These 
figures include subversive deaths in clashes with the security 
forces and with a group of indigenous people of the Ashaninka 
tribe. 
  In second place, as far as persons killed are concerned were 
the Lima and La Selva regions, with two each (11 percent of the 
total). The two civilians, killed in Lima, died in the attack on 
the home of Patricio Ricketts, a journalist, while in La Selva 
region, a Army sergeant died in a clash with subversives and a 
farmer was murdered for not paying taxes levied by the SL. 
  Finally, in last place in terms of persons killed was the 
Norte region, with one person dead (six percent of the total). 
This was the murder of the mayor of Huaylillas, in the Province 
of Pataz.

  [Text] Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, May 24 KYODO -- Four 
nations advanced an alternative proposal Tuesday [24 May] to a 
plan for imposing a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic that would 
virtually bar Japan and other whaling nations from resuming 
commercial whaling. 
  Chile, Argentina, Sweden and Switzerland jointly put the new 
proposal forward at a session of the International Whaling 
Commission (IWC) here, conference sources said. 
  The compromise plan appeared to stand a better chance of 
being approved than the original French-led proposal, the 
sources said. Of its joint sponsors, Chile voted against and 
Mexico for a similar sanctuary plan at last year's meeting while 
the remaining two abstained. 
  The revised plan is a scaled-back version of the drastic 
French proposal which would ban whaling in a vast area of the 
southern hemisphere that stretches from latitude 40 degrees 
south to the shores of the Antarctica, they said. 
  The fresh proposal, however, if adopted, would mandate a ban 
on any hauls of minke whales, the last large whales to have 
survived the modern whaling era, whose numbers are estimated by 
the IWC at 760,000. 
  Japan, where whale meat consumption is considered customary, 
has been calling for exclusion of minke whales from protection 
under the sanctuary formula. 
  The proposal, however, corresponds with the Japanese 
proposal 
in that it would pare down the scope of the French-proposed 
sanctuary to a narrower area that stretches from latitude 55 to 
60 degrees south to the Antarctic shores. 
  It would authorize hunting of sei whales, which make an 
annual migratory tour throughout a vast aquatic range stretching 
to the equator. Sei whales are reportedly endangered. It would 
also allow whaling in the 200-nautical-mile zone off the shores 
of Chile, one of the four proponents of the proposal.

<F P=106> ["Dumping" published in English throughout item] </F>
  [Text] "We are 14 very different countries, but we have 
some common interests. We acknowledge that after the GATT's 
Uruguay Round we have achieved a certain progress, but it is not 
enough. Therefore, from now on we will redouble efforts in order 
to obtain other advantages with less subsidies and a freer and 
more clear-cut agricultural trade. And we are optimistic 
because we are now in a better position than when the Uruguay 
Round began." 
  With these words Australian Bob McMullan, president of the 
Cairns Group, summed up what was accomplished at the 14th 
meeting, which closed on 20 May in Montevideo after two days of 
debates. 
  Answering a battery of questions after he made the final 
declaration known, McMullan was able to explain future 
objectives: "We want free competition. The market does not 
matter as long as the principles of free and fair trade are 
respected. We are not attacking competition; we are defending 
it while pushing for a world without trade barriers." 
  McMullan, who is minister of trade and administrative 
services for his country, flatly denied Australia obtained 
benefits from Europe while the GATT negotiations were being 
held, and he indicated that the Cairns Group will evaluate the 
types of dumping that some nations carry out. "We are not 
referees," he said, "but we will be ready to revise every type 
of unfair practice that is carried out in order to be able to 
fight it." 
  The Canadian and Argentine representatives were obliged to 
speak due to the sale of Canadian wheat to Brazil that is an 
Argentine concern. The Canadian representative [not further 
identified] said: "The price of our wheat is the same as other 
market prices. We do not carry out unfair trade and there is 
nothing irregular or illegal in our procedures." Argentine 
Agriculture Secretary Felipe Sola said: "The Cairns Group is not 
a referee that has to decide bilateral situations, and we have 
not come here to ask for explanations. What we have proposed is 
that from now on the group will study the dumping situations, 
and then it will fight them if it considers them unfair." 
  Asked about this point, Uruguayan Agriculture and Fishing 
Minister Pedro Saravia stated that from now on, the Cairns Group 
must look into matters that could influence free trade in the 
future, such as the social aspects of labor and environmental 
topics. 
  Regarding the group's functioning, it will continue its 
annual meetings, and it has been agreed that the next meeting of 
ministers will be held in the Philippines in May or June 1995, 
"although if circumstances demand it, we will meet before that 
date," McMullan said. 
  It has been agreed that from now on some of the countries 
will have the responsibility of closely following some matters 
and they will draft reports to submit to the other countries. 
In this respect, Argentina will evaluate matters pertaining to 
dumping, Chile will do the same regarding world trade in fruit 
and vegetables, the Philippines will evaluate the fishing 
industry, and Australia will look into the matter of 
agricultural subsidies and try to evaluate them in precise terms.

  [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- Today, the presidents of 
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela reasserted their 
commitment to the integration process of the Andean Group (GRAN) 
or Cartagena Agreement on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. 
  The five presidents expressed their support for the Andean 
integration process in separate communiques issued here today by 
the Cartagena Agreement Board (JUNAC), the GRAN's technical and 
executive body. 
  Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada stated the 
common problems affecting Andean countries are the basic factor 
in their unity. He added: "More than ever before, the 
challenges and hopes the Andean Group represents still prevail." 
  Sanchez de Lozada stated: "With our creativity and effort, 
we still must strive to achieve a better life for our countries." 
  His Colombian colleague, Cesar Gaviria, stated on the 
occasion of GRAN's 25th anniversary, "we have to rejoice over 
the implementation of this idea that has made a great 
contribution to the unity of our countries." He added: "Today, 
trade is the great force behind economic development, 
integration, and the well-being of nations." 
  Gaviria asserted that in these two and a half decades, GRAN 
faced difficulties "because the prevailing protectionist 
practices undermined commercial and integration processes." 
  He added: "Today we hope the Andean Group will develop. We 
also hope to establish a common export tariff, although we are 
aware this does not constitute a goal in itself but a means for 
achieving a free trade zone throughout the entire continent of 
the Americas." 
  Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen stressed the 
"integrating tradition" of GRAN members and reasserted his 
country's support for "the Andean integration process." 
  Duran-Ballen stated the Andean Group faces the immediate 
challenge of establishing an Andean free trade zone and helping 
Andean countries achieve "a level of modernization and 
proficiency that will allow them to achieve a definitive and 
advantageous presence in the international market." 
  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori stated that his country 
shares with other Andean countries "a profound integrationist 
spirit." Fujimori explained that Peru temporarily withdrew from 
GRAN's economic process from August 1992 to April 1994 because 
of the serious domestic crisis his country was experiencing. 
  He added that today, Peru has been able to achieve economic 
stability and has reassumed "with great enthusiasm, the noble 
task we assumed with our Andean brothers a quarter of a century 
ago." 
  After noting that businessmen were skeptical about the 
Andean 
Group's success when it was implemented, Rafael Caldera, the 
president of Venezuela, which joined the Andean Group 23 years 
ago, praised the fact that private business has become the most 
important integration force. 
  Caldera added: "The celebration of the anniversary of one of 
the most effective and auspicious Latin American integrationist 
movements constitutes an auspicious event not only for its 
members but for all developing countries."

  [Excerpts] Lima, 25 (EFE) -- On 26 May, the Andean Group 
will celebrate its 25th anniversary without having attained the 
objectives of social integration and an improvement in the 
living standards of all its inhabitants, who number some 100 
million. [passage omitted] 
  On the occasion of its anniversary, the Andean authorities 
have issued a series of documents referring to the current 
status of the integration process. One of these documents admits 
that, despite the obvious progress made, "there are still great 
differences between the social groups within the member 
countries." 
  Therefore, it adds, "the challenge that the Andean 
countries, 
in an individual and collective manner, must undertake is to 
promote equal opportunities; grant the great majority access to 
the right to education, housing, and health; improve the living 
standards of the population emigrating from the rural areas to 
the cities; and strengthen the institutions of civil society." 
  The document explains that from a closed model at the 
beginning, the group has moved to an open one with automatic 
community mechanisms where the market system prevails, starting 
with genuine competitive advantages and the adjustment of 
community regulations to international levels. 
  According to the document, in 1993, the Andean GDP amounted 
to $142 billion and increased at a greater rate than its 
population, that is, at a 3.2 percent rate per year, "which 
means the Andean Group has increased its available assets and 
services." Per capita income in the Andean Group increased by 
three times between 1970 and 1993, going from $515 to $1,850. 
  Services have made the greatest contribution to the increase 
in GDP, with $70 billion which represents approximately half of 
the total $142 billion, followed by the manufacturing and 
agricultural sectors, which in 1993 amounted to $26 and $21 
million respectively. 
  Inflation has been curbed and shows a tendency to decrease 
by 
a monthly average of 0.5 percent in Bolivia, 1.8 percent in 
Peru, 2.8 percent in Ecuador and Colombia, and 3.1 percent in 
Venezuela. 
  Trade between the Andean Group member countries has also 
increased. In the seventies, it amounted to $112 million and in 
1993, it amounted to $2.88 billion, which represents 
approximately 10 percent of the Group's total exports of $29.459 
billion. Foreign investments in the region have also increased, 
from $3.4 billion in the seventies to almost $14 million in 1993.

  [Text] Today, 26 May, the newspaper GRANMA published an 
article entitled "Pharisaism," which points out that 20 May was 
the 92d anniversary of the (eunuch government) installed through 
U.S. military intervention in Cuba. The article reports that for 
the Cuban people, this date was an ill-fated moment in our 
history. 
  The article adds that President William Clinton, who is not 
Cuban and need not be, had decided to commemorate that 
castration with a 400-word message aired by anti-Cuban radio and 
television. Four miserly paragraphs are what this arrogant 
superpower produced to make pronouncements on today's Cuba and 
spread the unsolicited opinions of the U.S. Government. They did 
not have to deliver that message, but Clinton decided to do so, 
adhering to the old idea of annexation that today still 
manifests itself with insistence upon its desire to annex us to 
their new world order. 
  The crudeness of the U.S. President's communique suggests an 
electoral message directed more toward Miami than toward Cuba. 
GRANMA clarifies that in November, Floridians will vote and that 
several interests are at stake in that election. Perhaps this is 
why in the first of his four paragraphs, William Clinton 
describes the 35 years of the Cuban Revolution as an inhumane 
dictatorship, saying that he has a profound desire for Cuban 
people to live in liberty. 
  The Yankee president wants to believe that we Cubans are 
gullible sheep, that we will identify that inhumane dictatorship 
with the regime that preserved human dignity for the first time, 
and accustomed all Cubans to food and clothing and employment, 
something that the capitalist regime, prior to the Revolution, 
offered to only one-third of the work force. 
  GRANMA's article notes that if living in freedom means the 
Cuban people must return to 31 percent of the population having 
no education, 24 percent illiteracy among the adult population 
and 66 percent among children up to 10 years of age; a 
49-percent unemployment rate; 32 percent of the homes having 
dirt floors and thatch roofs, 65 percent of these houses without 
running water, 72 percent without sanitary systems; 36 percent 
of the peasants infected with parasites, 31 percent of them 
suffering from malaria, and 14 percent of them suffering 
tuberculosis -- just to quote a few indicators -- then we really 
are not interested in that liberty, which is truly inhumane 
because it is the philosophy of every-man-for-himself. 
  In another part of his message, U.S. President William 
Clinton says the observance of democracy, human rights, and a 
government that reports to the people are the cornerstones 
considered in relations between the United States and Latin 
America, and Cuba does not comply with these requirements. 
Clinton made such comments about the only government in this 
hemisphere, including the United States, that not only reports 
to its people, but in a supremely democratic procedure including 
millions of people, the only one of its kind, opens political 
issues such as Cuba's economic situation to public debate. 
  GRANMA asks: Where does the average American express his 
opinion on taxes or on the economic policies of Washington, 
either to support or to oppose the decisions of government, 
which are a select group of corporate plutocrats? 
  GRANMA points out that in his message, President William 
Clinton says he wants the same for us as for all the people of 
America. He then specifies what those wishes are: freedom of the 
press, freedom of speech, protection against arbitrary 
imprisonment, respect for a legitimate legal process, and a 
state of law. 
  GRANMA says that Clinton's message makes no reference to 
Cuba's nor to any of its Latin American neighbors' right to 
live, work, receive education, food, health care, and housing. 
There is no reference whatsoever to the elimination of poverty, 
which implies balanced economic development and better 
distribution of wealth. 
  All this stems from the old and well-known individual civil 
rights, which mean little or nothing to the deprived majority. 
It is just the same rhetoric as usual.

  [Text] The dialogue between the Central American chiefs of 
state and U.S. Vice President Al Gore resulted in the setting of 
conditions and promises that did not come anywhere near what had 
been expected. 
  For the six presidents who participated in the dialogue with 
Gore, it was most important to know the White House's position 
on the possibility of the Central American countries forming 
part of the free trade agreement signed by the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico. But for the United States, the objective of 
the minisummit was to prepare for the upcoming hemispheric 
summit President William Clinton convened in Miami for December. 
  Gore discounted any kind of short- or mid-term link between 
the Central American countries and NAFTA. Instead, the vice 
president offered his interlocutors a program that would only 
give textiles and apparel treatment equivalent to that provided 
under NAFTA. 
  Gore cautioned, however, that to benefit from this program, 
the Central American nations would have to open their domestic 
markets to U.S. textiles and apparel.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon de </F>
Quesada in London by reporter Francisca Paquita Calvo Zapata at 
the Radio Havana Cuba studios in Havana; date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Calvo] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], is in 
London having been invited by the British representatives of the 
Parliamentary Union. Radio Havana Cuba would like to ask 
Ricardo Alarcon his general impressions of the visit of a Cuban 
assemblymen's delegation to Great Britain. 
  [Alarcon] This visit has to be seen, first, within the 
framework of a specific reality. The British Parliament invites 
only two foreign delegations each year. This year, they decided 
to ask us to visit the UK. We accepted and discussed a date 
mutually convenient to the two countries, which was at this 
time. It allowed me to make this visit following the special 
session of the ANPP in early May, and here we are. 
  But I must point out that it is significant, in my judgment, 
that this country's parliament considered Cuba to be one of only 
two delegations to be invited this year. I have been here a 
little over two days, and we have not had a break. We have had 
meetings with the speaker, that is, with the president of the 
Parliament's House of Commons, who, together with the president 
of the House of Lords, invited me. We met with two parliamentary 
commissions today and with a group of British businessmen. 
Tomorrow we will have two more meetings with this country's 
businessmen and with the British Government's Caribbean Trade 
Advisory Commission. We also met today with the secretary of 
state, who is in charge of the Latin American and Caribbean area. 
  I would say it has been, or rather continues to be -- I 
still 
have various meetings tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and 
then we shall end the visit -- a very intense, very useful stay 
during which many contacts were made and discussions held with 
many people on a level of great respect and cordiality. I think 
our British friends are capable of showing their guests much 
hospitality, and a certain degree of frankness, flexibility, and 
understanding, which is truly admirable. 
  [Calvo] How will this visit benefit the relationship between 
Cuba and Great Britain, and the European countries, in general? 
  [Alarcon] To tell you the truth, here we have been 
concentrating on Great Britain, which is a European country that 
has a lot of influence. Its conduct, its inclination, tends to 
attract followers from other European countries. I can tell you 
that it is clear that in the next few months there will be a 
follow-up on actions that were slowly taken this year, which I 
am sure will result in more British activity in Cuba. We await 
-- and that was decided in today's conversations -- the visit of 
Great Britain's secretary of state for trade in September. The 
UK, Great Britain, has traditionally been linked to the 
Caribbean area. Remember that a large part of the Caribbean, 
from Jamaica to the Caribbean's eastern limits, was colonized by 
England, had a special link with the UK, is part of the 
Commonwealth, etc. The British have more knowledge of and more 
presence in the area. Based on that, they have a more 
reasonable, realistic policy, and a better understanding of the 
Cuban reality and the international reality that has allowed 
them, through frank dialogue with Cuban authorities, to slowly 
build a relationship that grows more cordial and natural every 
day.

  Today's report covers diverse aspects of the efforts of this 
military division, ranging from task work, personnel, 
production, and equipment to workers' welfare and productivity. 
This EJT division, which was created seven months ago, tends 50 
percent of Havana's lands and is already attaining significant 
results. 
  Today, Raul Castro pointed out how much can be done even 
under the difficult conditions we are experiencing, through 
optimism, better use of resources, and better organization of 
the labor force. 
  [Begin recording] [Castro] Yesterday, I briefly mentioned to 
several leaders in Alquizar, several provincial agriculture 
leaders, that the EJT is the pride of the FAR and that -- within 
the framework of the law so no one can say we are threatening 
anyone -- we are not going to let speculators or the 
inefficiency of that large bureaucracy called state collection 
pilfer their work and prevent it from reaching the population. 
[end recording] 
  Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan states that experiences 
such as these, given their importance and reach, ought to be 
extended to state enterprises, Basic Cooperative Production 
Units [UBPC's], and cooperatives. 
  [Begin Jordan recording] I believe this experience is 
undoubtedly the most integral and complete I have seen. In the 
future, it would be good for this type of visit, including 
Raul's presence, to continue for assessment of the work of the 
UBPC, and above all, the farming cooperatives, given their 
importance. I believe there are many interesting things here 
that we can broaden, implement, and generalize in the rest of 
the production organizations, which have also accumulated a 
series of experiences we ought to analyze. [end recording]

  [Text] Havana, 24 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Miguel Alfonso, 
official spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, said he will 
hold periodic meetings with the media to brief them on the 
Ministry's activities and to answer reporters' questions. The 
diplomat and scholar, who has been Ministry spokesman since 
April, said his appointment was due to a "need that had been 
felt for a long time." The Foreign Ministry spokesman is 
virtually the only official of his kind in the Cuban Government. 
  Alfonso said that during the meetings with reporters, he 
will 
brief them on the activities of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
and other Ministry officials as well as comment on events in the 
area. He did not say, however, if officials in other ministries 
would assume a similar role. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman began his duties in April 
during "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference, which was 
attended by Cuban officials and approximately 200 exiles. On 
that occasion, Alfonso was introduced as a conference spokesman, 
but in ensuing weeks he continued as spokesman for the Foreign 
Ministry's routine activities. 
  The Ministry spokesman is a professor at the Higher 
Institute 
of International Relations and until last year was a member of 
the Cuban delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission based in 
Geneva, Switzerland.

  [Text] On the morning of 25 May, technical difficulties in 
generator units at the Antonio Guiteras electric power plant in 
Matanzas and the Antonio Maceo electric power plant in Santiago 
de Cuba have resulted in a deficit of approximately 400 
megawatts in the nation's generation of electricity. Electric 
power sector officials in Matanzas announced that in the case of 
the Antonio Guiteras plant, the problem was due to tears in the 
boiler's heat-exchange surfaces. Damage assessment and repairs 
will begin at noon today. Specialists have stated that if the 
needed repairs are found to be minor, they could be done in two 
or three days of intense work, bearing in mind that the 
temperature of the boiler must drop before repair work can begin. 
  The breakdown of the 330-megawatt generating unit caused a 
deficit of 70 megawatts during the morning and afternoon; and in 
the evening, the peak demand period, the deficit was of 90 
megawatts. 
  Specialists are making great efforts -- particularly since 
the sugarcane harvest is in the final phase and in light of 
other important economic activities -- to ready a schedule of 
outages for when power is available. The outage schedule will 
also guarantee an equitable supply of water to the residential 
sector.

  [Text] Everything is ready for the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit that will be held in June in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia, to promote regional integration. Everything is ready 
so far as organization is concerned, and only the details need 
to be finalized. This was the report given today in Havana by 
Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos and Cuban Ambassador to 
Colombia Jesus Martinez. 
  The Cuban ambassador said different versions of the summit's 
main document had already been analyzed, and that the first to 
receive copies were the host countries: Mexico, Spain, Brazil, 
Colombia, and Argentina. The fifth summit will be held in the 
last country. He added that he was here to convey the attention 
being paid to the Cuban position and to make recommendations 
concerning the contents of the various subjects. He said the 
Cuban position has achieved consensus among these five countries. 
  Moreover, Bolanos referred to the previous three summits, 
the 
objectives concerning cooperation and integration, and the key 
factor for success. 
  [Begin Bolanos recording] We made an assessment of the three 
previous summits because the results are not in keeping with the 
aspirations. Cuba has always tried to strengthen the [word 
indistinct] and the integration ideas, and we will continue 
working in this fourth summit toward those objectives. With this 
summit, we hope to break some barriers to adopt positive 
actions, not only in the cultural but in the educational areas 
as well, and to discuss some problems that might be hampering 
integration. [end recording] 
  He added that this summit will be important so far as 
functioning is concerned, and that in addition to speeches by 
the chiefs of delegations, which will each be seven minutes in 
length, there will be panels to discuss different issues, and 
that these panels will be chaired by outstanding figures from 
the region. He also highlighted the position Cuba will take to 
the summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. 
  [Begin Bolanos recording] We are not leading preparations 
for 
the summit, but we are preparing proposals concerning trade 
violations, certain obstacles to integration, and cooperation on 
our commercial development with our economy, and investments 
that I think are very important. [end recording]

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the 
Central Electoral Board (JCE) of the Dominican Republic 
announced the conclusion of the initial vote count for the 
general elections held on 16 May, the results of which indicated 
President Joaquin Balaguer was the winner. 
  The electoral authorities, however, refrained from 
proclaiming the Reformist Social Christian Party (PRSC) 
candidate the victor because the official resolution on charges 
of irregularities filed by the opposition is still pending. The 
JCE considers the charges filed by the opposition parties to be 
"nonexistent" despite the lack of verification of eight voting 
tables, according to JCE spokesman Francisco Alvares. 
  According to the results of the JCE, Balaguer obtained 42.44 
percent of the votes, while the largest opposition party, the 
Dominican Revolutionary Party, led by Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, 
who made charges of alleged fraud, obtained 41.40 percent. 
Third place was held by the Democratic Liberation Party (PLD) 
of former President Juan Bosch, which obtained 13.8 percent. 
  The results were suspended for a period of time until the 
authorities were able to explain which of the two presidential 
candidates had committed the least amount of electoral fraud at 
the polls. 
  Even though the figures provided by the JCE gives Balaguer 
the victory, Pena Gomez said he would continue until he has 
exhausted all peaceful means to denounce the "colossal fraud" of 
which he claims to have been a victim.

  [Excerpt] Santo Domingo, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today under 
protest, Representatives of the opposition Dominican 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), which nominated Jose Francisco Pena 
Gomez as its presidential candidate, joined the second day of a 
review of the Dominican elections. 
  After opposition parties filed charges of electoral fraud, 
107 electoral boards decided to review the vote count 
certificates for the 16 May elections, an activity which the 
[word indistinct] joined this Thursday under the premise that 
not all the certificates had been manipulated. 
  Pena Gomez said the fact that he is joining the certificate 
review does not mean he is validating the figures manipulated by 
the vote counting center. The politician said he will prove 
that the tens of thousands of people who supported him, which he 
described as a considerable number, are twice the number of 
those who supported the Reformist Social Christian Party (PRSC), 
which nominated President Joaquin Balaguer. 
  The PRD said the majority of its members could not vote 
because their names were not included on the voter lists even 
though they had their credentials. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- The political 
crisis facing the Dominican Republic was reflected today in the 
explosion of five homemade bombs in various streets of Esperanza 
municipality without causing any casualties, the police reported. 
  The bombs were hurled by hooded individuals and one of them 
exploded near the headquarters of the Dominican Revolutionary 
Party (PRD) headed by Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential 
candidate in the 16 May elections who has made accusations of 
fraud. A police report said there were no casualties but 
several individuals, presumably responsible for the attacks, 
were arrested. The police and Army initiated a surveillance 
operation along the streets to prevent another attack. 
  The political crisis erupted when the elections closed with 
the PRD making accusations of a "scandalous fraud" planned by 
the followers of President Joaquin Balaguer at the Central 
Electoral Board (JCE) computer center. 
  Tourism representatives reported that numerous trips, 
especially from Europe, were suspended because of the news 
generated by the crisis facing the country. "The Dominican 
Republic political situation is a threat to the tourism industry 
which generates substantial revenues for the country," an 
important tourism businessman pointed out. The Dominican 
Republic is visited by 1.4 million tourists, who generate more 
than $130 million, the equivalent of 70 percent of its 
exportable goods.

  [Text] The new U.S. envoy in the Haitian crisis, William 
Grey, began his mission with a visit to the Dominican Republic. 
On 25 May, William Gray met with Dominican authorities, 
including President Balaguer, regarding the possible closure of 
the border. He was accompanied by Dante Caputo. 
  We have since learned that last night, President Balaguer 
committed himself to completely closing the border with Haiti in 
order to guarantee respect for the UN embargo against the 
country. 
  The spokesman for Mr. William Gray, U.S. special envoy, 
confirmed that President Balaguer committed himself to 
completely closing the border out of respect for Resolution 917 
of the UN Security Council, following a two-hour interview with 
the head of the Dominican state. 
  Balaguer's government, which is opposed to the embargo, has 
been accused by some North American sectors of allowing the 
passage of goods, especially fuel, to Haiti. President Balaguer 
made no comment following his meeting with President Bill 
Clinton's special envoy.

<F P=106> [By Ramon Malenciano] </F>
  [Excerpts] Marcher (Haiti), 26 May (EFE) -- While the 
effects of Dominican Republic President Joaquin Balaguer's 
decision to close the border with Haiti are still being 
monitored, the military and wealthy Haitians continue to profit 
from an increase in cross-border trade. 
  Wednesday, President Balaguer promised William Grey, U.S. 
special envoy to Haiti, and UN and OAS envoy Dante Caputo that 
the Dominican Republic would completely close its border with 
Haiti in accordance to UN Security Council Resolution 917. 
Nevertheless, Haitians buying fuel in the community of Marcher, 
located next to the Dominican township of Dajabon, pointed out 
that Haitians and Dominicans are still obtaining "significant 
gains" from the sale of crude oil along the border separating 
the two nations. 
  Jackson Marcelin and Benoit Antuan, two Haitians who make 
their living by trading along the border, indicated to EFE that 
the sale of fuel in this area "is a lot better than before." 
They added that in the township of Marcher, a fuel distribution 
center located on the banks of the Masacre River, the military 
has posed no "problems, although it is necessary to give them 
something (money)." [passage omitted] 
  Gerardo Gil, 30, a Haitian, agreed with his compatriots, 
stating, "business between Dominicans and Haitians is continuing 
as usual." Gil explained that on Monday, the Dominican 
(military and customs) authorities allowed "unrestricted entry" 
to those Haitians who normally cross the border every Monday and 
Friday to buy and sell in Dajabon. 
  The so-called "gasoline market" extends for nearly 1 km 
along 
the Haitian side of the Masacre River in Marcher -- a region in 
which Haitians have set up small shops operating in Dominican 
territory. It is in this community where citizens from both 
nations distribute fuel which, according to Haitians 
interviewed, they then export to Port-au-Prince and other 
Haitian cities subject to the UN-imposed embargo. The objective 
of the embargo is to pressure the military leaders -- who, in 
September 1991, toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- into 
stepping down from power. 
  According to those Haitians who spoke with EFE, the fuel is 
taken to Qanaminthe, where it is then accumulated "gallon by 
gallon" before being taken to the "wealthy and the military in 
Port-au-Prince." A gallon of gasoline (3.8 liters) that costs 
20 pesos ($1.60) increases in value to more than 50 pesos 
($4.00) once it crosses the border. Despite this, Haitians only 
receive between one-half and two and one-half pesos (between 
four and 20 cents in U.S. currency) from the entire transaction. 
  In addition, Haitian sources said their profits tend to drop 
even more because they have to pay the Dominican military five 
pesos (40 cents) for each gallon that crosses from the Dominican 
Republic into Haiti. The same sources noted that last week fuel 
trafficking decreased because of the presence of "white men" -- 
a reference to UN observers. The presence of UN observers was 
also the reason why the military decided to prevent movement 
across the border. 
  In addition to the sale of fuel in Marcher, Dominicans and 
Haitians also distribute rice, sugar, eggs, ice, and other items 
not found in Haiti in the wake of the total economic blockade 
that went into effect Sunday. These items increase in price by 
more than 300 percent once they cross the river separating the 
two nations that share the island of Hispaniola. Dominicans 
normally purchase plastic and other household goods sold in 
Haiti. 
  Marcelin, Antuan, and Gil confirmed to EFE reports disclosed 
by other Haitians who chose not to identity themselves and who 
indicated that trade along the border "is greater now than 
before, because the other side (the Dominican Republic) is 
experiencing an election." Nevertheless, it has been possible 
to ascertain that "officially," military officials in both 
nations are limiting the movements of Dominicans as well as 
Haitians. 
  Unsuccessful attempts were made to contact gasoline 
distributors in Dajabon in order to learn how the Dominicans and 
Haitians were distributing and selling fuel in Haiti, because 
gasoline stations were out of fuel and vehicle owners were being 
forced to stand in long lines, sometimes for as many as three 
days. 
  Nevertheless, according to Haitian sources, the considerable 
quantity of fuel that has already reached the "market" has 
prompted a decline in fuel prices. Citizens from both nations 
selling their goods along the border acknowledged that they 
"have heard" something about the embargo, but they added that so 
far it is not noticeable in the region.

  [Excerpt] Port-au-Prince, 26 May (AFP) -- On Thursday, 
President Emile Jonassaint's provisional government, which is 
not recognized by the international community, reported that 
unidentified foreign diplomats are "interfering" in Haitian 
affairs. 
  Diplomats, posted to Port-au-Prince, "insultingly and 
scandalously interfere in the internal affairs of the Haitian 
State," according to a Foreign Ministry communique, which 
expresses its "bitterness and absolute indignation" at these 
"intolerable deviations." 
  According to observers, the complaint refers in particular 
to 
U.S. Ambassador William Swing and his spokesman, Stanley 
Schrager. On Thursday, the U.S. Embassy in Haiti strongly 
condemned the assassination of four opposition members by armed 
men between Sunday evening and Monday morning in Cite Soleil, 
the largest shantytown in Port-au-Prince. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On 24 May, the U.S. House of Representatives took a 
stand to oppose a U.S. military intervention in Haiti. On the 
contrary, they favor the establishment of a free port on La 
Gonave Island where refugees can be received. The lower house of 
Congress adopted this nonconstraining amendment to the defense 
budget, by 223 to 201 votes. The amendment was presented by 
Representative (Porchugos), a Republican from Florida, and 
emphasizes its opinion to the executive. 
  The vote came after the U.S. Navy, in charge of enforcing UN 
sanctions against Haiti, on 22 and 23 May, fired [words 
indistinct] against two Bahamas-registered ships, which ignored 
their orders by trying to break the embargo. In its amendment, 
the House of Representatives expresses its opposition to a 
military invasion of Haiti unless there is an urgent and known 
danger threatening U.S. interests or citizens. 
  President Bill Clinton has not formally ruled out the use of 
force against the military that is exercising de facto power in 
Haiti. A new regime of sanctions imposed by the United Nations 
went into effect on 21 May. 
  The text also proposes that a free port be opened in La 
Gonave, an island located off Port-au-Prince with 80,000 
inhabitants and a small military contingent. This free port 
could be used to examine the requests of Haitian refugees who 
wish to be granted political asylum in the United States and as 
a base for President-in-Exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  We have also learned from reliable sources that besides the 
eight U.S. ships stationed off Haiti to ensure enforcement of 
the international embargo, the aircraft carrier Eisenhower, and 
the helicopter carrier (Rusp) also embarked into Haitian seas, 
with 650 additional Marines whose mission is to enforce respect 
for the embargo. They stated: We are ready to carry out any 
action provided that its main objective is to drive the military 
out of power. 
  For the time being, the White House confirmed that Bill 
Clinton has made no formal decisions about sending troops to 
Haiti in order to reinstate President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

  [Text] Provisional President Emile Jonassaint met with 
about 30 senators and deputies at the National Palace from 1530 
to 1700 on 25 May on issues concerning the Haitian parliament. 
According to a press release from the special cabinet of the 
provisional president of the Republic, the representatives 
elected by the people touched on problems relating to the 
parliamentary institution and to issues concerning their 
constituencies. 
  The summit of the Army High Command should also be 
mentioned. 
A source close to the military command advised us that 
high-ranking officers of the Haitian Armed Forces and those in 
charge of units and garrisons in both Port-au-Prince and 
provincial towns met on 24 May at Army Headquarters. This 
meeting lasted several hours, focusing on major issues, 
according to our source, which indicates that both the Haitian 
situation and the international matter were broached. 
  The management of the country under the United Nations total 
embargo, the curb on the clandestine emigration of boat people, 
and the Army's improvement of the judicial system were the three 
main topics discussed in this meeting, presided over by Army 
chief, General Cedras. The military also discussed the Army's 
response in case of foreign military intervention, but this 
subject was the eighth of 11 points discussed during this 
meeting, which lasted several hours. 
  Gen. Cedras was surrounded by the Army High Command, 
commanders of the country's nine departments, the navy, 
aviation, engineering, communications, health, and anti-drug 
representatives. The intensification of the fight against drug 
trafficking and crime was also part of the agenda during this 
important meeting of the Haitian Army High Command.

  [Text] Still within the framework of enforcing the embargo 
against Haiti, eight U.S. warships are crisscrossing one another 
offshore. Six U.S. Coast Guard ships have also been 
crisscrossing off Haiti in an effort to intercept Haitian boat 
people. The eight U.S. warships in charge of enforcing respect 
for the embargo are supported by frigates from the Canadian and 
Argentine navies. 
  Last Saturday and Sunday, according to the Pentagon, the 
U.S. 
Navy fired warning shots twice at ships that were ignoring the 
orders of the ships that are enforcing the embargo. One of the 
ships succeeded, however, in reaching the Haitian coast.

  [Text] Mobilization for National Development [MDN] formed a 
special consultation committee. From 19 to 22 May 1994, MDN 
President Dr. Hubert De Ronceray received three delegations from 
the provisional government of Emile Jonassaint. The 
conversations focused on the MDN General Secretariat's press 
release, dated 17 May, and the measures to be considered for a 
better balance of relations between the party and the 
provisional government. This special consultation committee is 
in charge of immediately meeting with the incumbents of the 
various ministerial departments as well as the officials of the 
other sectors to collect information on the following points: 
measures by which to meet Resolution 917 of the UN Security 
Council, threats of foreign military intervention, and the 
political timetable of the provisional government. Let us listen 
to the explanations of Hubert de Ronceray. 
  [Begin de Ronceray recording] Well, I believe [previous 
three 
words in Creole] it is rather a sort of active observation, 
given that the government made a gesture that we greatly 
appreciated, that is, government figures came to meet with us 
and discuss a number of problems. Then, we thought we were also 
duty-bound to take those conversations into account, to continue 
them, and to carry on with them. This is the reason we formed... 
[pauses] the party formed this special consultation committee in 
charge of meeting with the various (?ministers) and other 
officials, listening to them, taking note of their projects and 
programs, and seeing to what extent their objectives agree with 
those of the party. 
  Once the committee gives us its report, we will see know 
where we stand, according to what is being done and what will be 
done. [end recording]

  [Text] The Front for the Restoration of Democracy in Haiti 
[Front pour Restorer la Democratie en Haiti], FRDH, asks General 
Raoul Cedras to show goodwill by respecting the Governors Island 
agreement, which demands his early retirement and the return of 
constitutionally elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  Since the enforcement of Resolution 917 of the UN Security 
Council, consisting of a total embargo, which has already been 
imposed on our country, we in the FRDH -- jointly with four 
other people's organizations -- cannot remain indifferent toward 
the suffering of the Haitian people. This is the reason we are 
again asking Gen. Cedras to show goodwill by standing behind his 
signature.

  [Text] Today, the leaders of the Organization of Eastern 
Caribbean States [OECS] got down to their first working session 
of the 23rd Authority meeting in Castries, St. Lucia. The 
meeting is scheduled to come to a close tomorrow. 
  Today began deliberations on a host of issues, including the 
preparation of maritime boundary delimitation negotiations, 
World Bank reports, and the follow-up on the just concluded 
Global Conference in Barbados. The Authority meeting, which was 
attended by all but one OECS leader, namely Prime Minister 
Nicholas Braithwaite of Grenada, yesterday welcomed its newest 
family member in the person of Antigua's newly elected Prime 
Minister Lester Bird. Mr. Bird addressed yesterday's official 
openings in his capacity as representative for the delegations. 
While noting that this time his role was different, he did, 
however, indicate that the task was not new, having had years of 
practice. 
  [Begin Bird recording] I wish to thank the chief minister of 
Montserrat and the prime minister of St. Lucia for the warm 
words expressed by both of you on my election to the prime 
ministership of Antigua and Barbuda. As many of you are aware, I 
have been attending conferences of heads of government of the 
OECS from its inception. Indeed, you accorded me the distinct 
honor of allowing me to be the first chairman even though I was 
not a prime minister. In that sense, I spent the last 14 years 
in this council impersonating a head of government. And many of 
you spent the last 14 years in complicity. I am pleased that by 
(electing the government a party) which I have the honor to 
lead, the people of Antigua and Barbuda have chosen to relieve 
not only me of the role of impersonator, but you of the role of 
collusion. 
  On a serious note, I have placed on record my profound 
thanks 
to OECS heads of governments past and present, who over the last 
14 years, have treated me with such great consideraton. Mr. 
Chairman, it is fitting for me that the first OECS heads of 
government conference I should attend as prime minister is held 
in St. Lucia. For on this island, (around) your wise and mature 
guidance, Mr. Chairman, our countries have together made many 
practical decisions which have advanced the economic and 
political interests of our subregion. [end recording]

Mexico City and the State of Mexico. 
  The body, the head of which was covered with a sack, 
received 
a gunshot wound to the forehead. A spent 9-mm cartridge was 
found on the car's floor, the official reported. The commander 
was identified by his electoral voting card, which has a 
picture, and the badge of the Attorney General's Office, which 
identified him as commander.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Sotero from the "ACIR Radio News"] </F>
  [Text] Cecilia Soto Gonzalez, Labor Party [PT] presidential 
candidate, commented on the events that occurred yesterday at 
the National Autonomous University of Mexico [UNAM] involving 
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, PRI [Institutional Revolutionary 
Party] presidential candidate, and accounting faculty students. 
  Ernesto Zedillo visited the UNAM, specifically the 
Accounting 
and Business Administration Faculty, to meet with university 
students in a closed forum at a faculty auditorium. What took 
place instead was several instances of verbal and even physical 
abuse against Zedillo. Things got so out of hand that the PRI 
candidate was nearly hit by a bottle or a stone. Insults may 
not cause any physical harm, but they do undermine an 
individual's morale. 
  Ernesto Zedillo had agreed to meet with the university 
students, who requested an open dialogue in the university's 
esplanade, not in a closed auditorium guarded by presidential 
security agents for several hours prior to the meeting. As a 
result, the dialogue never took place. The media, including 
Radio ACIR, have commented extensively on what took place. 
  The PT candidate said it would be a mistake to stop trying 
to 
hold dialogues at public and private universities and demanded 
respect for all presidential candidates. 
  Ms. Soto was interviewed after a breakfast meeting with 
bankers, businessmen, and investors at a Mexico City hotel. 
Naturally she condemned the abuse to which the PRI presidential 
candidate was subjected, saying it was an unfortunate incident 
that could jeopardize dialogues at the nation's universities. 
She called on everyone to keep working for dialogues at the 
universities. 
  Cecilia Soto stressed that the presidential candidates 
should 
not be attacked and should be received with respect. She added 
that the attack against Zedillo is an irrational action 
reminiscent of the dinosaurs. 
  Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate of the Mexican 
Green Ecologist Party [PVEM], said that what took place at the 
UNAM yesterday with Ernesto Zedillo must be analyzed within its 
real perspective. He added that university students have always 
been very serious about dialogues with the authorities. 
According to Gonzalez, the PRI candidate must also respect the 
guidelines in force at the UNAM. 
  The PVEM candidate said that perhaps the person most 
responsible for the incidents,which fortunately did not develop 
into anything more serious, was Zedillo himself. The PRI 
candidate organized a meeting with students that even included 
PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] members. In addition, 
it was a dialogue during which the genuine students were not the 
ones who spoke out. 
  Gonzalez Torres warned that there is pent up dissatisfaction 
among the population that is ready to explode throughout the 
country. He said that what the people really want is a closer, 
more genuine relationship with the presidential candidates, not 
violent confrontations such as that which took place this 
Tuesday between PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce 
and UNAM students. 
  During a visit to the community of (Pericos) as part of his 
campaign program, Gonzalez Torres rejected the figurative type 
of democracy that the government's candidate is offering as well 
as the Defense Secretariat's decision to purchase more weapons. 
  [Begin Gonzalez Torres recording] The campaign programs do 
not address genuine needs. You all witnessed how one attempt 
turned out. This indicates that first there is a need for prior 
contacts. Contacts cannot take place hastily; they must be 
gradual. I hope we will all be able to understand this. If 
not, we will be going along with a figurative democracy 
believing that everything is fine when the truth is that there 
is rising dissatisfaction throughout the nation and it is ready 
to explode The Mexican people do not want more weapons to 
repress them, they want assistance. The government's 
responsibility is to serve, not to repress or to remain in power 
by any means. [end recording] 
  The PVEM candidate's visit to (Pericos) was quite colorful. 
Gonzalez Torres distributed calendars and [words indistinct] to 
businessmen. Amid shoves and shouts, he stopped and spoke to 
the people, who were demanding answers from the federal district 
about increasing garbage, candidates not honoring their campaign 
promises, and a closer relationship with the candidates. 
(Pericos) businessmen, mostly young adults, shouted slogans 
such as "Green is Life" while the PVEM candidate toured the 
community. 
  Gonzalez Torres expressed his opposition to the appointment 
of citizen advisors, whom he described as more advisers to the 
PRI, the National Action Party, and the PRD than to society in 
general.

<F P=106> [Report by Lourdes Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Commerce and Industrial Development 
Secretary Jaime Serra Puche guaranteed there would be no 
expeditious elimination of tariffs in sectors whose 
representatives reject such a measure. "If any sector in Mexico 
opposes the expeditious elimination of tariffs, this will not 
occur," Serra Puche emphasized within the framework of a 
revision that will be carried out by the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiation teams. These teams will 
analyze a possible modification of the timetable for various 
production sectors. 
  The official warned: "None of the NAFTA members are duty 
bound to modify the timetable for the elimination of tariffs," 
so "they will only carry out changes that are advisable for the 
Mexican production sector and economy." 
  During a brief interview upon the conclusion of his 
participation in the Conference on North American Business 
Outlook, the commerce secretary said there is also enough time 
to carry out the necessary consultations to determine the 
approval or rejection of the nation's industrial community. He 
said if there is any objection from the production groups 
concerning the elimination of specific tariffs, the Mexican team 
will not bring those products to the negotiations. 
  Jaime Serra emphasized the importance of conveying to the 
nation's production sector the guarantee that, although NAFTA 
considers the possibility of expediting the previously agreed 
upon elimination of tariffs, provided the involved parties 
previously agree to this, the measure will only be implemented 
in the areas that request it. The authorities will impose no 
advance measures to abate the tariffs, the commerce secretary 
insisted after his speech at the event, which was organized by 
the Conference Board and the private sector's Center for 
Economic Studies (CEESP). 
  After various Mexican industry sector representatives 
rejected the expeditious elimination of the tariffs on their 
products, Serra urged production sector representatives to 
participate in the consultation process and determine in which 
areas a change should be requested. The goal was to guarantee 
-- as it was done throughout the NAFTA negotiation process -- 
agreements with the full support of those directly involved. 
  He said the necessary consultations are being carried out 
through the Coordinator for Foreign Trade Business Organizations 
(COECE) to detect support for an expeditious elimination of 
tariffs, or the denial to renegotiate the deadline for trade 
opportunities in each sector.

with the United States and Canada to speed up the elimination of 
tariffs on an official list of 157 products, most of which had 
protective terms lasting five to 10 years, as originally 
stipulated in NAFTA. 
  Today, the Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat 
[Secofi] invited businessmen and individuals involved in the 
production or marketing of those articles to express their 
opinions "for or against" speeding up the opening. 
  Secofi has reported that, to determine whether or not this 
expeditiousness is appropriate, the secretariat has consulted 
with the involved producers, chambers, and agricultural, 
livestock, and industrial associations through the Coordinating 
Board for Entrepreneurial Foreign Trade Organizations [COECE]. 
The list was composed based on this consultation. 
  The list includes glass, wine, vegetables, dairy products, 
grain, fruit, chemicals, vitamins, film, paper, fiber, textiles, 
fabric, footwear, silverware, screws, refrigerators, freezers, 
dryers, dishwashers, washers, machinery and equipment, ovens, 
stoves, bicycle spare parts, and tools, in general, among others. 
  We are dealing with the elimination of tariffs for a large 
number of articles. Some of the lines include bilateral export 
products whose quantities and values are considerable. 
  The invitation, published today in DIARIO OFICIAL DE LA 
FEDERACION, says: "Public consultation on the expeditious 
lifting of tariffs for products of North American origin, as 
stipulated by NAFTA, is hereby requested." The consultation will 
last one month. Negotiations will start later. 
  The negotiations will be virtually bilateral because 
Canada's 
demands to expedite the commercial opening are relatively few in 
relation to those presented by the United States and Mexico. 
Canada's requests represent only 8 percent of the total to be 
discussed. 
  According to NAFTA's paragraph 3 of article 302, NAFTA 
member 
countries can speed up the opening. "On request of any one of 
the members, the interested parties will carry out consultations 
to consider the possibility of expediting the elimination of 
tariffs provided for in the tariff elimination lists." 
  The inclusion of these products does not represents a priori 
commitment for the opening, but only the intention to sit down 
and negotiate. Nevertheless, "generally speaking, the three 
countries will consider lifting the tariffs on the products 
included on the list." 
  The 157 products appear on the list at the request of three 
countries' production sectors. In Mexico, all modifications will 
involve consultations with the involved sectors and will be 
negotiated between the governments later, Secofi said. 
  For this reason and to incorporate into the consultation 
process the opinions and proposals "of all interested parties," 
Secofi has invited all persons and enterprises who so desire to 
express their views on this subject through their chambers or 
associations represented at COECE. 
  Views for or against speeding up the opening for the 
products 
included on the list should be addressed to the entrepreneurial 
representatives prior to 23 June 1994. The remarks should 
include the name of the tariff group involved, the signatory's 
economic activities and the reasons for his interest, and 
specific arguments supporting his case, such as the effect on 
jobs, production, and exports. 
  The negotiations, "scheduled to be held in a few weeks," 
will 
discuss only the products included in the groups listed. In 
addition, the Mexican Government will agree to modify the speed 
of tariff elimination on goods from the United States and Canada 
and determine whether the consultation shows absolute consensus 
for speeding up the process among the national production 
sectors involved. 
  According to the list, which will also be released in the 
United States, the two governments will negotiate the 
expeditious lifting of tariffs on products such as wine 
(including sparkling wine, grape must, brandy, and wine 
coolers); various types of glass; textiles, such as flat cotton 
fabrics; polyester fibers; metalized thread, velvet, and plush; 
garments, such as suits, trousers, and silk ties; cotton towels; 
curtains; and various types of footwear. 
  The list also includes vegetables, such as potatoes, 
asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, and dried beans, and fruits, 
such as mangoes, lemons, and grapefruit. Also, corn flour, 
preserves, prepared or preserved tomatoes, and grapefruit juice 
and other citrus products. [sentence fragment as published] 
Also included on the list are photographic films, herbicides, 
lumber, blinds, chemical paper, silverware, screws, untreated 
zinc, stove spare parts, scissors, refrigerators, freezers, 
driers, dishwashers, washers, electric ovens, stoves, and ranges. 
  The list also includes chemicals such as sodium cyanide, 
monochlorodifluorethane, ethyl hexanol, tributylamine, 
ethylenediamine, diethylentriamine, triethylentetramine, 
lovastatine, e-nalapril malleate, hexamethylen, and 
sulfamerazine, among others. 
  In the invitation, Secofi points out that a country can 
refrain from participating in the negotiations on a given tariff 
group for two basic reasons: either the importing of that 
product to the country is already free of tariffs or the country 
has no interest in eliminating the tariff.

<F P=106> [Report by David Aponte and Gerado Rico] </F>
  [Text] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 23 May -- Today, the new 
archbishop of Guadalajara, Juan Sandoval Iniguez, said 40 
percent of the personnel in the Attorney General Office's (PGR) 
are "involved" in drug trafficking. This is why "no one has 
gotten to the bottom" of the homicide of Cardinal Juan Jose 
Posadas Ocampo and why the Arellano Felix brothers have not been 
arrested. 
  He said that high-level PGR officials "told me" that they 
are 
not absolutely sure which Federal Judicial Police (PJF) agents 
are trustworthy and honest, and which are linked to drug 
trafficking. 
  This has complicated the capture of the Arellano Felix 
brothers, chiefs of the Tijuana Cartel, "because when the police 
are told they are in a certain place, by the time the police get 
there they are already somewhere else." The police themselves 
give them a heads-up, the archbishop said. 
  He said the Catholic Church is not satisfied with the 
results 
of the investigation because it has not gotten to the bottom of 
the matter and the PGR has not arrested the real killers. 
  There is no "room for percentages" in assessing how the 
investigation is going because we do not know who the real 
killers are or their motives for the murder. The PGR has fought 
drug trafficking, but "they have not had the answers" to 
Cardinal Posadas' case. 
  In light of this, he said, Mexicans run the risk that 
impunity "may become entrenched in our fatherland and we will 
end up with a violent society, a dangerous society," if the 
homicides of Cardinal Posadas and Luis Donaldo Colosio are not 
solved. 
  The archbishop called a news conference in the capitular 
room 
of the Archdiocese of Guadalajara on the day before the first 
anniversary of the death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. 
Before beginning his remarks, he asked reporters from the 
international, national, and local media to pray. 
  He then began: "We have always said we still are not 
satisfied, that the investigation has not gotten to the bottom 
of the case, that we are not happy because no one has gotten to 
the bottom of this since the real killers have not been 
captured. All Mexicans -- not just the Church -- want these 
investigations to continue and for this crime to be cleared up 
soon." 
  [Question] What is your evaluation of the authorities' 
behavior, especially that of the PGR? 
  [Sandoval Iniguez] We have been in touch with high-ranking 
PGR officials. They have assured me they are very interested in 
the investigation; they are determined to clear up the murder. 
In fact, they want some assistance, some of our help. This is 
why we have called on anyone who may have some information... 
It could be these people may supply details that may have been 
misinterpreted by others. 
  "They face many difficulties on this road. First, because a 
year has already passed and second, because all municipal, 
state, or federal police forces in Mexico are either 
contaminated a little or a lot. They were telling me, for 
example, that 40 percent of the people who work for the PGR are 
not to be trusted. They say that even they do not know who is 
who; they do not know who the trustworthy and honest agents are. 
They do not know who is involved with the drug traffickers or 
with other groups who buy off these people's consciences. That 
is how the security forces are infiltrated and why they have 
people working there who are not trustworthy." 
  [Question] Could this be blocking the investigations? 
  [Sandoval Iniguez] ...They (high-level PGR officers) claim 
this is one of the reasons why this and other investigations 
have not been wrapped up. They even told me that when they go 
to arrest criminals, some people warn the criminals in advance. 
When they arrive on the scene, the criminals are gone. That 
could be one of the reasons. 
  The same is true of the Arellano Felix brothers, who escape 
when they learn that authorities are coming after them. Drug 
traffickers have plenty of money to corrupt and buy off people's 
consciences and thus ward off any action against them, he said. 
  But the Catholic Church will not fight that kind of 
corruption. There will be other ways for that. But it will not 
stop insisting, as all citizens must, that the homicide should 
be resolved even after the current six-year presidential term 
ends, he added. 
  Surrounded by some of his aides in the room housing 
paintings 
of the archbishops of Guadalajara, Sandoval Iniguez recalled 
that the president of the republic said the crime would be 
solved and said "he should be asked about it." 
  "I would also like to say in this forum that all society 
should demand, each one of us must demand that justice be done. 
A democratic country must not leave its hopes and dreams in the 
hands of two or three people...this is a demand of all society," 
he said. 
  [Question] Are we living in a country of half-truths? 
  [Sandoval Iniguez] I believe our truths are less than 
half-truths. We can barely get to a half-truth, he said 
ironically. [as published] 
  He mentioned that the PGR has not briefed the Archdiocese of 
Guadalajara on the investigations since November 1993. 
  A journalist asked if he feared any possible reprisals for 
his statements. The archbishop said: "I do not think I will be 
the object of reprisals for what I am saying because I am not 
offending or injuring anyone or telling lies." 
  Sandoval Iniguez said that on Tuesday, 24 May, the crypt 
containing the remains of the late cardinal will be open from 
1000 to 1800. During the evening, the archbishop will officiate 
at a mass in memory of Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.

<F P=106> ["Ocosingo Message" by Eduardo Robledo Rincon, Mexican </F>
Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, candidate for the 
Chiapas governorship, broadcast over the radio to residents of 
Chiapas jungle from Ocosingo on 23 May] 
  [Text] Red Radio Chiapas, Ocosingo, 23 May 1994 
  I came to Ocosingo, gateway to the Chiapas jungle, to add my 
efforts toward peace. I came to express my respect for those 
who risk their lives in the defense of their ideals. I have 
said it: I agree with broad sectors of Chiapas society which 
believe the social demands that have been made are just. I also 
believe, however, just as broad sectors believe, that the path 
chosen has resulted in grief, pain, and sacrifice. 
  I understand that the people of Chiapas must do something 
soon. We must do it right to work for reconciliation. We must 
make an effort to have peace with justice and to have the 
dignity that all people of Chiapas want. 
  I am convinced that electoral campaigns -- I am not 
referring 
to mine, but to those of all parties -- must effectively aid the 
reconciliation. I believe this, and I have made my campaign a 
parallel path for reconciliation. Society must know that. 
  Therefore, I urge all parties to put differences aside and 
make this campaign a crusade for peace. Let us make it an 
offensive for peace, like commissioner Manuel Camacho said. 
  I think everyone, especially the parties, should do his 
share 
and do it well. We must work from the bottom up, adding not 
subtracting. I think that is the way to move closer to peace. 
  The state's political conditions, which stem from ancestral, 
economic, and social problems, call for new rules. 
  In Chiapas, we must turn our backs on the past, but not on 
all of the past. We must remember the best of it. We must be 
conservative. We must preserve our culture and old traditions. 
  In Chiapas, especially in this region, where children do not 
attend school and where they die of hunger, where hundreds, 
perhaps thousands do not know how to read or write, we must 
think of realistic ways to build them a new future, a future 
that will guarantee them the right to be born and to live with 
dignity. We must build a future that guarantees health, 
development, education, housing, employment, and land, 
especially land, for them. In other words, we need to guarantee 
that everyone will have food tomorrow. 
  How should we treat this land issue? How should we reconcile 
historical reason with the law? 
  Chiapas has been a different Chiapas since 1 January. Many 
of us knew it, but many more just discovered this pluralistic 
society: We are several races; we are from several regions; we 
speak different languages; we have different climates; we have 
different temperaments; we have different religious beliefs. 
  I believe the secret lies in how to direct this social 
energy 
toward building a common future; how to make all this strength, 
all this energy, a great social victory for the Chiapas people. 
  I agree with those who say that Chiapas is a heck of a town 
to defeat. 
  I think this new pact can be considered a proposal. It is 
like a method of discussion for finding agreements that will 
allow us to build our future. 
  This is why I insist that we should make this political 
campaign a permanent debate. It should be a basis for finding 
that which unites us and rejecting that which separates us. 
  This social pact must be implemented by society. To do this, 
I propose forming a pluralistic government. When I say 
pluralistic government, I am not just referring to a government 
with many parties in it. I am referring to a government that 
will unite its different religious, environmental, regional, 
political, economic, and social aspects. 
  To do that, we need: 

  -  just laws, an autonomous judicial 
branch, an honest police force, and fair economic 
laws; 
  -  sustainable economic development. We must guarantee an 
economic system that will promote the welfare of the population 
without jeopardizing opportunities for future 
generations; 
  -  thorough social reform based on education to supply 
the necessary tools for finding jobs; 
  -  democracy based on 
legality and legitimacy. 

  I offer a pluralistic government that will use Chiapas' best 
men, regardless of their party affiliation. I will not rule 
with my friends. All I need to form a new government is men who 
are honest, conscientious, and competent. 
  Transition is a process. To implement it without problems, 
we must have a strong government, a government that cannot be 
short-termed. I propose a strong government, very strong; a 
government whose strength is based on the law, on what is right, 
on consensus, on legitimacy; a government based on the people's 
support and on pluralism.

  [Text] San Jose, 26 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican President 
Jose Maria Figueres today said he will review a U.S. proposal 
presented to Central American nations concerning Haitian 
refugees. Under the plan, the Central American nations would 
receive Haitian refugees "temporarily" while a solution is 
sought to the current crisis in that Caribbean nation. 
  Figueres told ACAN-EFE that Washington is working with the 
UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in an attempt to "assist 
those Haitian citizens who feel politically threatened." 
  Figueres added: "The idea is for these people to stay here 
on 
a temporary basis, until they can be returned to Haiti." 
  Although Figueres stressed that "all of us are concerned" 
about the situation in Haiti, "so far, we have yet to make a 
decision." He added, "We will be evaluating the request within 
the next few days." 
  Meanwhile, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo 
confirmed Washington had indeed presented the request to Costa 
Rica, but he explained that it would affect only political 
refugees, not economic refugees. He added that the issue would 
be studied jointly by the United States and Costa Rica.

  [Text] Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, Central Information 
Office [OCI] director, has said that, so far, the alleged 
removal of ministers from the executive cabinet are merely 
rumors, which must be denied because there are no official 
statements about it; in other words, the government is denying 
the continuous rumors on an alleged cabinet reshuffle reportedly 
planned by President Rafael Caldera. Vicente Briceno has the 
story: 
  [Begin recording] [Briceno] Alvarez reported that 
Transportation and Communication Minister Cesar Quintini Rosales 
still heads that ministry, but Quintini, who was at Miraflores 
Palace apparently attending a Council of Ministers meeting on 25 
May, refused to deny reports of his alleged removal from the 
cabinet. Alvarez noted that any governmental change is the 
decision of the president alone, thereby explaining that 
ministers are not hired, nor do they buy their posts. 
  The OCI chief rejected the existence of any ambiguity as a 
result of the division in the economic cabinet by ironically 
stating that the only division at the Council of Ministers is 
Defense Minister Division General Rafael Montero. 
  [Alvarez] There were rumors on a subject inherent to the 
president: the change, dismissal, or removal of ministers. No 
one else can make this decision. Therefore, these are 
unofficial rumors. 
  [Briceno] Despite the OCI director's statements, it is a 
fact 
that President Caldera could be thinking about revamping the 
executive cabinet. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Adriana Cortes] </F>
  [Text] Venezuela emerged as the sole exception to a 
Cartagena Agreement Board [JUNAC] report that adjustment 
programs applied by the five Andean countries over the past five 
years had positive macroeconomic results. In terms of the 
annual inflation index, Venezuela registered the highest price 
level and was the only country to maintain such a high index. 
Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador experienced a decrease in 
inflation. 
  According to the latest JUNAC figures, which were released 
prior to the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Andean 
Pact, Venezuela showed negative economic indicators last year, 
unlike the other four Andean countries. In 1991, the entire 
Andean Group registered an average inflation rate of 63 percent, 
with Peru and Ecuador showing the highest. At the end of 1993, 
the average rate was 33 percent, with Caracas showing the 
highest. 
  In 1993, Venezuela's inflation rate was 45.9 percent, 
followed by Lima with 39.5 percent, Quito with 34.8 percent, 
Santa Fe de Bogota with 23 percent, and La Paz with 8.5 percent. 
This situation represents a complete reversal from previous 
years. All the Andean countries except Venezuela showed 
decreasing inflation rates in 1992. 
  Venezuela's inflation rate eliminates one of the country's 
positive macroeconomic indices compared with the rest of the 
Andean Group, that is, per capita income. Given Venezuela's 
status as a petroleum producing country with a medium 
population, its per capita yearly income of $3,777 is the 
subregion's highest, followed by Colombia with $1,472. 
inflation negatively affects this indicator, however. 
  As for GNP, Venezuela is the only country in the subregion 
showing an economic decrease of one point against positive 
figures of seven points in Peru, 5.2 in Colombia, 3.2 in 
Bolivia, and 1.7 in Ecuador. 
  Regarding agricultural GNP, Venezuela is the only Andean 
country with a negative index of 5.9 percent, while Peru shows a 
positive 6.8 percent, Bolivia 5.4 percent, Colombia 2.7 percent, 
and Ecuador 1.3 percent. 
  Until 1993, Venezuela was the indisputable leader in net 
international reserves with $8.324 billion, followed by Colombia 
with $7.901 billion, Peru with $2.701 billion, Ecuador with 
$1.254 billion, and Bolivia with $371 million. That positive 
figure, however, will probably radically affect JUNAC's 
predictions because the financial crisis the country has been 
experiencing since January has greatly decreased international 
reserves. 
  Other aspects favorable to Venezuela are exports and the 
commercial balance, with the country registering the highest 
surplus in the subregion, $3.582 billion, as a result of its 
petroleum producing and exporting status. Only Ecuador, another 
oil country, shows a positive index of $439 million. Colombia 
shows a deficit in its commercial balance of $2.841 billion, 
Peru shows $626 million, and Bolivia $455 million. 
  According to a preliminary JUNAC economic analysis of the 
subregion in general, the Andean Pact member countries have 
grown at an average rate of 5.3 percent. This figure is higher 
than the Latin American average, which grew by more than 3 
percent, and even higher than that of developed countries, which 
grew at an average of 2 percent annually. 
  "By applying adjustment programs, the Andean Pact member 
countries have successfully controlled their inflation rates, 
which in the past few months have been close to 1.5 percent 
monthly, significantly lower than the 5.3 percent registered in 
1991. The member countries have solved foreign debt problems, 
restored foreign credit standing, and improved their social 
indicators," the document states. 
  The document also emphasizes the internal integration 
process. The establishment of a free trade zone in the past few 
years increased trade by more than 100 percent from 1989 to 
1993. In December 1993, trade amounted to $2.886 billion, a 30 
percent increase over the 1992 figure. 
  In addition, when the negotiations with Mexico conclude in 
the framework of the Group of Three, negotiations intended to 
include the other Andean countries, the potential market will be 
doubled, reaching 200 million consumers. The Andean countries 
will coordinate their positions at the Uruguay Round, 
particularly regarding the negotiation of goods and agricultural 
and institutional issues.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Yolanda Garcia from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Sunday, Interior Relations Minister Ramon Escovar 
Salom announced that the Vagrancy Law will continue to be 
enforced until a civil security law is approved. The interior 
minister visited Metropolitan Police Headquarters, where he was 
welcomed by Police Commander General Orlando Hernandez Villegas. 
The objective of the visit was to exchange views on the 
failures and successes in the struggle against increasing 
criminal activity in Caracas. 
  Escovar Salom explained that although he opposes the way in 
which the Vagrancy Law is being implemented, it is necessary to 
continue enforcing the law as long as a civil security law is 
not approved. 
  [Begin Escovar recording] As interior minister, I would like 
to express my complete support for the Caracas police, as well 
as my support for the governor and mayor of Caracas in their 
handling of urban security issues. As you all know, up to 
several weeks ago, the level of gun-related violent crimes was 
down. But then these kinds of crimes soared, continued to rise, 
and then began to drop off again. Most of all, I want to know 
what will be done this weekend, and how it will be done, in 
order to understand the shortcomings and to determine what 
adjustments should be made. 
  I have invited the Federal District governor to a meeting to 
reach an understanding on this issue. I am aware that you are 
all interested in asking me about the use of firearms. I 
imagine this is one of the main issues of concern, the other 
being related to what is going to be done with the neighborhood 
scourges -- those individuals involved in violent crimes in 
Caracas and who represent a danger to the people. 
  As long as a new law is not approved, the Vagrancy Law will 
remain in effect. Personally, I do not like the Vagrancy Law. 
Nevertheless, there is no other option but to depend on this 
law as long as Congress does not approve a civil security law. 
Meanwhile, there will be a need to enforce the Vagrancy Law. 
[end recording] 
  The interior minister also expressed his opposition to the 
use of firearms to quell demonstrations. Escovar Salom 
indicated that any officer of the Metropolitan Police or any 
other police division that takes part in controlling 
demonstrations must abstain from using his weapon to control 
student activities. 
  [Begin Escovar recording, in progress] ...if there are 
shortcomings in the actions of the Metropolitan Police or any 
other police officers. Another issue I would like to explain is 
related to the use of firearms. I cannot endorse the 
indiscriminate use of firearms by police. This cannot be 
tolerated in any country. In other words, the police can use 
their weapons only in accordance with standard regulations. 
This is why these weapons are described as service weapons. In 
no way does this sanction police to use their firearms 
indiscriminately against protesters. In other words, we need to 
implement guidelines similar to those used in other countries 
governing police actions. 
  On the other hand, we cannot have a police force that is 
restricted, unprotected, and without room to maneuver. It is 
impossible for police to conduct themselves like timid rabbits. 
They must have mechanisms that allow them to exercise their 
duties whenever necessary. This entails specialized training 
for them in the area of respecting individual rights. We want 
neither a police force that intimidates, nor one that is weak. 
[end recording] 
  Escovar also indicated that he had information related to 
the 
likelihood of a food blockade in the metropolitan area, which 
could result from the current strike by Coche Market workers. 
He said he recently met with Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz 
to discuss measures necessary to prevent difficulties or 
inconveniences from affecting the population. 
  In addition, the interior minister indicated that measures 
were also being taken to transfer those individuals suspected of 
criminal activities to the El Dorado and (Igorro) Prisons in 
Valencia. Both prisons are now undergoing renovations.

<F P=106> [Report by Edwin Gongora from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] head Enrique 
Ter-Horst confirmed that his group will verify the training of 
National Civilian Police [PNC] members in the face of alleged 
departures from the original initiative. Salvador Sanchez 
Ceren, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] leader, 
said the creation of the joint commission tasked with 
investigating the alleged irregularities within the PNC, is part 
of the latest rescheduling of the peace agreement. 
  The last report by the UN secretary general to the Security 
Council, in which he underscores irregularities in PNC training, 
has already been acted upon by those involved. On Monday, 
Ter-Horst said the group is already doing verification work to 
report, by 30 June, whether the new security corps has 
militarized. 
  [Begin Ted-Horst recording] I believe that right now it is 
not practical or constructive to describe whether the PNC is 
militarized. The government has a clear resolve to correct any 
error or irregularities detected in June. [end recording] 
  Ted-Horst said that like any new institution, the PNC has 
its 
problems, however, these are being quickly faced and resolved. 
  Salvador Sanchez Ceren, FMLN representative to the National 
Commission for the Consolidation of Peace, expressed confidence 
in the commission tasked to evaluate how civilian the PNC is. 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] All the irregularities the UN 
secretary general lists will be investigated. We have also 
verified this on site and have been able to confirm that the 
academy is militarized, starting with the monitor corps, and 
that there is an imbalance in the chain of command. The academy 
is made up of a majority of national policemen, and this creates 
an imbalance. [end recording] 
  The new scheduling between the government and the FMLN 
mentions, among other dates, 15 March 1995 for completing the 
National Police demobilization and the full deployment of the 
PNC, with an average of 8,000-10,000 policemen. The land 
transfer process is scheduled to be 70 percent complete by 30 
April 1995. With this new schedule, the head of Onusal said 
President Cristiani has cleared all pending peace matters. 
Nevertheless, for Sanchez Ceren, Cristiani leaves instead a 
more specific schedule, which the new Calderon Sol 
administration shall be unable to elude.

<F P=106> [Report by Mario Jovel from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On Monday, President Alfredo Cristiani, in view of 
the UN secretary general's latest observations, announced a 
special commission will verify that the National Civilian Police 
[PNC] is not militarized. 
  The president disclosed that this commission will comprise 
an 
Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] representative as well as 
National Public Security Academy [ANSP] and PNC directors. 
  In an 11 May report sent to the UN Security Council, UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali states that former security corps 
sergeants are in charge of PNC criminal investigations, and 
members of the former antidrug unit are taking the posts of 
commissioners. The report adds that ANSP graduates are 
discriminated against because none of them have been appointed 
commissioners. Ghali has called for these mistakes to be 
corrected to avoid having the PNC become more militarized. The 
president, however, rejected these assertions. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] We disagree with this report. 
Last week, we brought everything up to date just as we had said 
we would do, including the public security topic. For the 
secretary general's peace of mind, a commission is being created 
to verify whether this is true. On no account have we attempted 
to militarize the PNC. [end recording] 
  The commission that will verify the civilian nature of this 
new security corps will include ANSP Director Mario Bolanos, PNC 
Director Jose Maria Monterrey, and one Onusal representative. 
In the same report, Ghali explains that persistent deficiencies 
have been found in the training of PNC members in legal matters 
and in the use of force and firearms. For the president, these 
failures have an explanation: 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] One must remember that we are 
trying to hurry and deploy the units as soon as possible and 
that exclusive courses lasting six months are being given with 
much effort. These courses are insufficient to create a 
completely trained public security policeman. To my way of 
thinking, once the PNC has been fully deployed, we need to 
continue to give members courses and training. [end recording] 
  Likewise, Cristiani said that another special commission 
will 
be created to verify the enrollment of PNC members in the ANSP, 
which should not surpass 1,000 members or 20 percent of the 
total. According to the president, it was agreed in last week's 
meeting to clear all pending matters that the demobilization of 
the former security corps will continue until 31 March 1995.

  [Text] The terrorists who attacked an Army helicopter in 
Quebrada Pena Blanca (Chanchamayo) on 12 May may be members of 
an MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] column that 
protects some five "firms" of drug traffickers operating on the 
outskirts of the jungle in that region. This was asserted by 
Interior Ministry intelligence sources, according to which the 
terrorists allegedly come from San Luis de Shuaro. 
  The terrorists belong to one of the MRTA columns that have 
lost their slight ideological tint, and are surviving as a 
mercenary group protecting a Mexican "firm" that is allegedly 
trying to grow poppy plants in the surroundings of Sanchirio, 
Alto Batinaki, Santa Herminia, and on the banks of the 
Paucartambo River near Villa Rica. 
  This, however, is not the only organization of foreign drug 
traffickers: Colombian and Bolivian drug traffickers operate in 
the region in cahoots with Peruvian traffickers. 
  Intelligence experts maintain that this MRTA column, and 
those located on the outskirts of the Satipo (Junin) and 
Oxapampa (Pasco) jungle, enjoy the compulsory help of peasant 
and indigenous communities, whose leaders and heads of family 
are forced, under threats of death, to cultivate coca leaf, 
marijuana, and poppies. They are also forced to produce washed 
cocaine paste, which provides the MRTA with a significant income. 
  According to information obtained from peasants in Villa 
Rica, 500 kg of washed cocaine paste are shipped to Colombia 
each week. This represents an income per shipment for the 
terrorists of approximately $225,000, taking into account that 
the drugs are sold at $1,800 per kilo and the terrorists collect 
25 percent of the total amount. 
  As for the "political military" organization of that 
terrorist group, the analysts believe the MRTA Central Regional 
Committee has lost its geographical domain. In other words, it 
no longer has the same control it used to exercise in Pasco and 
Junin, and only survives due to its link with drug traffickers. 
  Another source of income is allegedly the protection fees 
the 
MRTA members charge merchants, businessmen, and passengers 
travelling through San Francisco, Esperanza, Miraflores, and 
Villa Rica in Oxapampa (Pasco).

  [Text] Business people throughout the country and drug 
traffickers from the Upper Huallaga pay MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] approximately $5 million per year in 
"war duties," according to documents confiscated from Emilio 
Villalobos Alva, "Comrade Polo," a MRTA national directorate 
member recently arrested by Dincote [National Counterterrorism 
Directorate]. 
  According to what Villalobos Alva told Dincote agents, 
currently approximately 50 powerful Peruvian businessmen and 
industrialists and 200 medium-size merchants are on MRTA's 
computerized list of those who paid from $100 to $400 per month. 
  Operation Alacran III -- during which Divicote-2 [Dincote 2d 
Division] agents found MRTA strongholds in Lima, Barranca, and 
Arequipa -- however, revealed all this information and radically 
cut the resources MRTA received from Peruvian business people 
through either blackmail or abductions. 
  In the meantime, MRTA terrorists continue to receive money 
from drug traffickers in Upper Huallaga, whom they protect when 
transporting drugs from one place to another or when shipping 
drugs abroad. 
  According to our sources, Comrade Polo's confessions, and an 
assessment of the documents and archives the Divicote-2 agents 
confiscated from MRTA strongholds revealed that the money was 
distributed as follows: 
  Part of it was deposited in bank accounts in Paris, France, 
where Hugo Avellaneda Valdez, Comrade Eloy, lives. Avellaneda 
Valdez, MRTA international coordinator, is in charge of 
distributing the money together with other MRTA leaders living 
abroad and with leaders of the MIR [Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left] international wing. Deposits are made by 
computer via "modems," which were seized at one MRTA stronghold 
raided by counterterrorist agents. 
  As we reported some days ago, the MIR international wing is 
financed by contributions from American and European terrorist 
groups, to whom they send weapons and highly trained subversive 
elements in military tactics. 
  Another part of the money is withheld by the terrorist 
leaders in Lima to pay foreign -- Chilean -- terrorists for the 
crimes committed together with MRTA and for the logistics 
apparatus that was run by terrorist Ramos Edison Loayza Alferez 
(arrested). 
  This group used the money to buy or rent houses used as 
strongholds; to purchase vehicles, weapons -- brought from 
abroad, computers, faxes, and communications equipment; and to 
set up clandestine workshops to make military or police uniforms.

  [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- Peruvian Foreign Minister 
Efrain Goldenberg said today that trade, integration, 
investments, and social issues are the basic issues that should 
be discussed at the fourth Ibero-American Summit to be held in 
Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). 
  Goldenberg, who is also Peruvian prime minister, said 
cooperation in the drug enforcement and antiterrorist areas are 
other important issues that must be discussed at the 
Ibero-American presidential summit to be held in June. 
  He added that the overall political agenda also should 
broach 
the subjects of limited arms spending and renewed support for 
the prompt signing of an agreement banning nuclear tests. 
  Goldenberg told EFE: "Peru is willing to discuss and find 
common viewpoints on all these issues and others that may come 
up during the negotiations." 
  He later stressed the importance of the Ibero-American 
summits and added that all the ones held so far -- in Mexico, 
Spain, and Brazil -- "have strengthened ties between our peoples 
and governments and have helped us to better understand our 
situations and potential." 
  Goldenberg added that this is also true of the financial 
system and that "our increasing trade in Europe should be viewed 
as a natural result of this." The Peruvian foreign minister said 
trade will be one of the main issues to be discussed at the 
Cartagena de Indias summit and this will allow us to continue 
improving in this area. 
  Goldenberg believes that instead of adopting joint positions 
on priority issues -- such as democracy, poverty and social 
development, integration, investment and trade -- for the 
upcoming Presidents of the Americas Summit to be held in Miami 
by the end of the year, Ibero-American countries should try to 
perfect their viewpoints. 
  He said Ibero-American and Caribbean countries have been 
holding informal discussions in this regard within the Rio Group 
and that he believes it will be "interesting and useful" to 
exchange views at the fourth Cartagena de Indias summit. 
  Goldenberg said he believes regional integration processes 
will be able to develop when it is understood that in principle 
the integrationist model is not the same as before, that it is 
not conceived as a means to protect inefficiency "or even less 
to artificially subsidize closed markets." 
  He said: "The issue in question now is to compete in 
international markets. To achieve this we need open and free 
integration mechanisms, and this will be viable when 
macroeconomic and national policies are sufficiently harmonized."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 26 May. 
  The Peruvian-Russian Yugansk Petro-Andes Inc. consortium 
will 
invest $10 million in oil exploitation in the Titicaca Basin and 
in the country's southern Andean area. This announcement was 
made by Carmen Alva de Benavente, the consortium manager in 
Juliaca. The first drilling will be in Canchi Chico, San Antonio 
District, Puno Department. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 14 May 
94 p 9) 
  The National Commission for Foreign Investments and 
Technology reported that foreign investment in Peru will total 
$3.629 billion through 30 May, a 100 increase compared to late 
1993. The privatization of the Peruvian Telephone Company and 
the National Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru accounts for 
$2.002 billion of the investments. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 17 
May 94 p A3) 
  Energy and Mines Minister Daniel Hokama reported that 
current 
gold production rose to 25 metric tons per year. He said Peru 
plans to become the leading country with a production of more 
than 100 metric tons of gold per year. He noted that in the past 
two years, private investors have asked for authorization to 
prospect in more than 5 million hectares. They are RTZ of Great 
Britain, Angloamerican of South Africa, Cambior and Cominco of 
Canada, Newmont of the United States, and Shougang of China.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] The 39 deputies of the FSLN [Sandinist National 
Liberation Front] unanimously threw their support behind Dr. 
Sergio Ramirez Mercado to remain head of the Sandinist bloc 
after Ramirez resigned from the post during a special meeting of 
bloc members yesterday afternoon. 
  After meeting for three hours, Deputy Dora Maria Tellez, 
member of the FSLN National Directorate, publicly announced 
Ramirez's intention to resign from his post within the FSLN bloc 
and the deputies' decision to vote down that resignation. "We 
have not only rejected this resignation, but we have also 
endorsed his mandate because his work as the chief of our bloc 
has served the struggle in the interests of both the FSLN and 
the needy sectors of society," Commander Tellez indicated. 
  According to Deputy William Ramirez, the Sandinist deputies 
are convinced that to maintain the unity of the bloc and 
relations within the National Assembly, it is not advisable to 
accept his resignation. 
  It was reported that all 39 lawmakers concurred in voting in 
favor of Ramirez. Damaso Vargas, who represents the interests 
of the Sandinist Workers Federation in the FSLN bloc, confirmed 
the unanimous backing for Ramirez's mandate. 
  "The statutes do not make the Sandinist bloc a component of 
the FSLN structure and for that reason the bloc has the 
opportunity to coordinate its actions and choose its directors. 
What is vital is to carry out the resolutions of the Sandinist 
Congress," he noted. 
  "Dr. Ramirez submitted his resignation for obvious political 
reasons," Dora Maria Tellez added, explaining that the Sandinist 
Assembly approved the bloc's internal regulations, which 
establish the mechanism to elect its authorities. 
  Tellez added that the National Directorate does not plan to 
submit the topic of the leadership of the Sandinist bloc to a 
debate. "In the meeting held today (yesterday), the Directorate 
said Directorate members do not necessarily have to be 
well-liked by everyone," she added. 
  Ramirez, who from the moment he learned of his exclusion 
from 
the new Sandinist Directorate announced his willingness to 
resign, saying he would abide by the decision of his colleagues. 
"I think what lies ahead in the weeks to come is our 
legislative work because the Sandinist bloc must continue to be 
a key part in the complex machinery of national stability," 
Ramirez stated categorically. 
  Dr. Ramirez declined to comment on the topic of factions 
because, at this time, he was still speaking as chief of the 
Sandinist bloc. The public statement by Commander Monica 
Baltodano on the possible change in the Sandinist bloc's 
leadership was one of the events that hastened the discussion on 
this topic among the FSLN lawmakers. 
  In the early morning hours, Dr. Ramirez said he will 
continue 
his struggle for the renewal and transformation of the FSLN from 
the inside "and never from the outside," adding that battles are 
not won in a single day. "I am already too old to let someone 
else decide for me whether or not I am a revolutionary, or 
whether or not my ideology is correct," he noted. "now, there 
is a certain trend on the part of some FSLN comrades to grant 
certificates of revolutionary legitimacy and to decide who is a 
neoliberal and who supports or opposes the masses," the FSLN 
bloc chief noted.

<F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>
  [Text] Bayardo Arce, member of the National Directorate of 
the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], has said Dr. 
Sergio Ramirez should continue to head the Sandinist bloc in the 
National Assembly because he has done an excellent job and 
because this decision should be left in the hands of bloc 
members. "I do not think he will be replaced," Arce added. 
  Arce said the expansion of the FSLN National Directorate to 
15 members and the ratification of most members of the 
traditional National Directorate were outstanding decisions made 
at the Sandinist Special Congress. 
  The vote by the congress delegates left out only two 
previous 
members of the top Sandinist executive body, namely, Dr. Sergio 
Ramirez and Commander Jaime Wheelock, who did not run because he 
is studying abroad. 
  The removal of Dr. Ramirez "is in keeping with the need and 
the will voiced by the congress to renew the leadership and to 
endorse the traditional directorate," Arce said. 
  He said this action should not be interpreted as "punishment 
of an individual" who had supported the theory that Sandinism 
should respond to the majority, as certain people had claimed in 
the halls of the Olof Palme Convention Center. "Although, we 
could talk about a political defeat," Arce said, "I actually 
think the congress had to simply choose 15 people. It is like a 
baseball game in which someone has to win and someone has to 
lose." 
  Nevertheless, Arce believes Dr. Ramirez will not be left out 
of the decisionmaking process. He added that among the National 
Directorate's first tasks will be the creation of new 
mechanisms, a task that will benefit from his knowledge and 
experience. 
  Arce, who supported the candidacy of Daniel Ortega on the 
opening day of the congress, downplayed Dr. Ramirez's absence at 
the closing ceremony. He said the same was true for Commander 
Victor Tirado, who was brought from his residence after being 
approved as a National Directorate member. 
  "I do not give any political significance to Sergio's 
absence," Arce pointed out. "I want you to know that if Daniel 
had extended his speech, I would have fallen asleep," the 
high-ranking leader joked. 
  During an informal news conference after the closing of the 
congress, Arce refused to say whether Sandinism achieved a 
consensus during the three days of discussions, but he did say, 
"we achieved substantial progress," and he suggested heeding 
Commander Ortega's invitation to continue fine-tuning the 
discussions. 
  Arce thinks the mixture of traditional and new figures poses 
a challenge to the National Directorate: "We need to learn from 
the incoming youths and climb to the level set by our heroes and 
martyrs, whom we replaced in the struggle against the 
dictatorship."

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergio Ramirez Mercado, FSLN faction leader, </F>
by unidentified reporter; place and date not given; from the 
"Events" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Ramirez] I want Nicaraguans to know we are aware 
that we still have work to do and that we have a political 
position to pursue. I want to reiterate that I have listened to 
fellow Sandinists and believe that their views are logical. The 
party's common interest is above my own. We have always worked 
for the common interest. The FSLN represents social rather than 
political interests. The FSLN seeks to benefit the majority of 
Nicaraguans; stability [words indistinct] is not enough. We 
have always strived for social laws that help alleviate the 
current poverty and misery facing Nicaragua. In light of these 
goals, which are above my personal interests, I have 
reconsidered my decision. 
  [Reporter] The decisions of the FSLN bloc will always be 
subject to the Sandinist Assembly. I am referring specifically 
to the constitutional reform regarding reelections. 
  [Ramirez] Constitutional reforms were discussed by the 
Sandinist Assembly, which is the FSLN's highest consultative 
body. The Assembly approved guidelines for negotiations, and 
the Sandinist bloc has fully complied with these guidelines. We 
have worked with the other factions on the draft constitutional 
bill, thus abiding by the said guidelines. I believe this 
matter will not be reviewed again by the new Sandinist Assembly. 
  [Reporter] Then, will the FSLN be subject to the Sandinist 
Assembly? 
  [Ramirez] There is no reason for the FSLN not to be subject 
to the Assembly since it is a political party. As William [name 
as heard] said, the Sandinist Assembly is a part of the 
political whole embodied by the FSLN.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 May (EFE) -- Paraguayan President 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy has said: "I will do my utmost not to 
dissolve Congress." A similar statement was once made by 
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. 
  Wasmosy made this remark during an exclusive interview with 
the Buenos Aires newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO. Wasmosy said the 
Congressional Committee on Illegal Activities "puts its foot in 
its mouth so often it has totally lost credibility." 
  The Paraguayan president noted that Fujimori "strengthened 
democracy" in Peru and expressed hopes that "the Paraguayan 
people will mature." 
  Wasmosy said: "Part of the labor movement believes in 
violence and makes demands they know cannot be granted." 
  Wasmosy added that the appearance of a guerrilla movement in 
Mexico and the people's rebellions in Paraguay and Argentina 
"are part of the same plan." 
  He said former Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti 
handled the democratic transition in Uruguay "better" than Raul 
Alfonsin did in Argentina. 
  Juan Carlos Wasmosy said the peasant rebellion is part of an 
ultra-leftist campaign and that the Paraguayan military "have 
adapted to democracy even though no one wants to admit it." 
  "We reduced the number of generals from 62 to 38. Congress 
stripped them even of their food coupons and reduced everything 
they had," Wasmosy said referring to his policy to reorganize 
the Armed Forces "without losing the chain of command or 
discipline." 
  The Paraguayan president said labor leaders "know" the 
government "cannot give them a 40 percent salary increase 
because it would mean 40 percent inflation." 
  Wasmosy ratified the Paraguayan commitment to the Common 
Market of the South (Mercosur) which his country is implementing 
with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. 
  "There is no path other than integration, unless someone 
shows me something better," the president stressed, adding that 
he rejected labor leaders' requests to withdraw from Mercosur. 
He added: "This does not mean I will jump into an empty 
swimming pool and kill my country with me." 
  Wasmosy said Paraguay supports the coordination of Mercosur 
member countries' economic policies. "We must find a way to 
understand the problems facing Brazilians without ruining 
Argentine industrialists," Wasmosy added. 
  The president said that during the Alfonsin administration 
(1983-89), "there was a reaction against the Argentine Army" 
following the repression of guerrillas which resulted in some 
9,000 deaths, according to official figures. 
  "If the military did not do what they did, Alfonsin could 
not 
have done what he did, and President (Carlos) Menem could not 
have consolidated the Argentine economy," Wasmosy stressed.

  [Text] According to a joint declaration signed yesterday 
afternoon by Foreign Ministers Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner and 
Sergio Abreu Bonilla, Paraguay and Uruguay have begun to 
negotiate an agreement, which should be signed as soon as 
possible, establishing the two countries' reciprocal assistance 
in recovering stolen cars. The signing of this document will 
contribute to repressing this illegal activity, and will help 
speed up the process of returning stolen cars. 
  The joint declaration was signed at the Foreign Ministry. It 
was the Uruguayan foreign minister's last official activity in 
Paraguay. Abreu is scheduled to return to his country this 
morning after a 3-day official stay in our country. 
  In the joint declaration, the foreign ministers also 
recognized the increase in the consumption rate and illegal 
trade in narcotics, which constitutes a grave threat to our 
peoples' health and well-being and obligates all nations to 
share in the responsibility of repressing it. 
  The ministers ratified the importance for the two countries 
-- in the context of the Parana-Paraguay waterway -- of the work 
to eliminate existing obstacles to the effective use of port 
facilities granted to Paraguay in Montevideo and Nueva Palmira. 
Port authorities and operators from the two countries will meet 
in Montevideo during the second half of July. 
  The Uruguayan foreign minister returns to his country on a 
private plane at 0900 this morning.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis </F>
Galindo by Luz Maria Noli at the TVN Network studios in Panama 
City; date not given; from the "Dialogue" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Lewis] Thank you very much for inviting me. I am 
very grateful to be here with you. 
  [Noli] Sir, what will be the foreign ministry's main goal? 
  [Lewis] Well, Luz Maria, the main goal is to contribute to 
Perez Balladares' number one priority, which is to improve the 
living conditions of Panamanians through the creation of 
well-paid jobs. To contribute to this, we plan to create a new 
Panamanian diplomacy, which besides addressing bilateral issues 
with other governments, will also be an instrument to promote 
our country. I believe the diplomatic corps has been ill-used. 
I believe the diplomatic corps should have important functions 
in promoting investments in our country and promoting the sale 
of our products. I also believe it is a priority task to secure 
scholarships for Panamanians. 
  Here we are always under the impression that our 
geographical 
position is our country's greatest asset. I do not share that 
opinion. The greatest asset of any country is the education of 
its people. We have to radically improve the Panamanian 
educational level. I do not foresee shirt-making plants here. 
I think we must prepare ourselves for the 21st Century so 
Panamanians will have skills, through education, to be able to 
have jobs requiring technological knowledge. 
  [Noli] You are aware that during the seventies, Panama 
conducted a diplomatic offensive that put this country's name on 
the map. How is your diplomatic offensive going to differ from 
that of the seventies based on your projections for the foreign 
ministry today? 
  [Lewis] Dr. Balladares believes as I do, that diplomacy 
should be conducted on a one-on-one basis, the same way that 
General Omar Torrijos carried it out during the seventies. 
Proof of this is that on Friday, President Perez Balladares; 
Jose Luis Sossa, Perez Balladares' national security adviser; 
and I were in Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, we discussed issues of 
great importance to the two nations. We are going to establish 
joint policies on how to fight drug-trafficking, on border 
disputes, and on a range of issues that cannot be solved through 
diplomatic notes. They must be solved, as the late Gen. 
Torrijos used to say, between the pitcher and the catcher. That 
is what I propose to do in cooperation with Dr. Perez 
Balladares. Tomorrow, the three of us leave for Santa Fe de 
Bogota to discuss with President Cesar Gaviria and his team 
steps for cooperation in many areas. One of them is 
drug-trafficking, which is one of Dr. Perez Balladares' 
priorities. In this way, we can try to change Panama's bad 
image abroad. 
  [Noli] You have mentioned our two neighboring countries. As 
I recall, in the seventies there was a saying that we should 
have an extraordinary relationship with those countries next to 
which we sleep. And I remember that at that time, Costa Rican 
President Daniel Oduber, if I am not mistaken, said that 
whatever Panama says, Costa Rica will follow. Do you hope 
relations with our neighbors will maintain the same excellent 
status of that time? 
  [Lewis] Well, of course. Without having yet taken possession 
of the foreign ministry, I have already spoken a number of times 
with Costa Rican President Jose Figueres, with whom I have a 
great friendship dating back to his father's time. 
  [Noli] Also, at that time there was a relationship with 
another country -- the United States of America. It was a 
relationship of friendship and partnership, and you were a 
protagonist of that relationship at a time when you could enter 
the White House practically unannounced, something which was 
very difficult for other ambassadors to do. 
  [Lewis] Luz, I am going to tell you something. Being a 
nobody, I lunched with President Reagan while he was president, 
and recently I was in the White House having lunch with some 
very important officials. I did not see President Clinton, who 
was at a news conference. But I can tell you that I have 
maintained the ties I made with important people in the United 
States when I was ambassador in 1977, and that my circle of 
friends in Washington has increased. They feel great respect 
for me and I for them. Consequently, in this atmosphere of 
mutual respect and dignity, I believe I can be of service to my 
country. 
  As a matter of fact, I was already retired because every 
cloud has a silver lining. When Noriega exiled me in 1989 -- 
and I spent three years in exile -- my sons took charge of all 
the family businesses. When I returned in 1990 [year as heard], 
I found that my children had done a better job than I had. So I 
was unemployed and I retired to a life of resting and reading. 
  Truthfully, when Dr. Perez Balladares invited me to join him 
-- he being a president elected by the Panamanian people with a 
tried and proven interest in creating a national reconciliation 
government -- my conscience would not permit me to reject his 
offer. I believe what President Kennedy said on one occasion: 
Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can 
do for your country. That is why I am here today. And I have 
great confidence Dr. Perez Balladares will move forward. He has 
the best intentions to make our country morally and economically 
sound. 
  [Noli] Tell me something. Let us talk about a partnership 
and 
friendship with the United States. How are you going to 
accomplish that? 
  [Lewis] I think the relationship between Panama and the 
United States should be conducted very closely between our 
foreign ministry and the U.S. Embassy, and our embassy in 
Washington has to play a very important role. In the United 
States, there are different power centers. The legislative 
branch is a great power in the United States. That is a real 
democracy. One has to make contact on a personal basis and I am 
certain that the person proposed by Dr. Perez Balladares as 
ambassador in Washington will be able to fully carry out all 
these activities. 
  I think our relationship with the United States needs 
serious 
attention. This has to be done with great professionalism, with 
much dignity, and with mutual respect. The United States is our 
friend, and we should perceive it as our friend. Today, it is 
the most powerful nation in the world and we should capitalize 
on the very special relationship we have with the nation. I do 
not in any way believe that the relationship with the United 
States should be conducted through blocs. We must speak with 
the United States as equals, with respect, but within a 
relationship beneficial to our interests. We cannot view the 
United States from a regional point of view. 
  [Noli] Does that mean that when we talk with the United 
States it will not be through the Central American bloc or any 
other bloc? Are we are going to talk as partners? 
  [Lewis] Talking with the United States through a regional 
bloc would mean losing our special relationship with the United 
States versus the rest of the countries. 
  [Noli] Tell me something about speaking with partners and 
friends. How does that fit in with a certain part of the 
population that feels that the U.S. bases should remain here for 
economic reasons? 
  [Lewis] Look we, and when I say we I mean the group that 
supported Gen. Torrijos, were determined to let future 
generations decide the relationship between the United States 
and Panama whichever way they believed was in the best interests 
of Panama. I remember that after the signing of the treaties at 
the OAS, Gen. Torrijos, who was my guest at the embassy, told me 
something that is still very clear in my mind. He said: 
Gabriel, we have fulfilled our mission. We have removed the 
ill-fated perpetuity clause from the treaties with the United 
States, and now a new generation will have to decide if it is in 
Panama's best interest to have the U.S. stay in the country 
after the year 2000. That is the prerogative of the new 
generation. 
  I never expected, however, to be involved in the decision of 
the next generation. That makes me the oldest among the 
youngest. 
  [Noli] Don Gabriel, from 1970 until 1994 -- there are 24 
years in there, if my math is correct, right? -- the world has 
suffered dramatic changes in this period. For example, the 
Soviet Union is no longer the Soviet Union, the Berlin wall does 
not exist, and there is a situation in East European countries 
that is totally different from the Yugoslavia of Josip Broz 
Tito. To try to achieve a diplomatic offensive in this changing 
world and occupy the position we once held, will that not leave 
us a bit out of sync with the present? 
  [Lewis] We are pressed for time, but the capacity of the 
Panamanian people is great. If we can assemble an adequate team 
and do things properly, I think that within six months of 
President Perez Balladares' inauguration, we should be able to 
change our image. 
  This will require shock treatment. It cannot be done slowly. 
The change has to be dramatic. We have to do heroic things to 
gain the confidence of foreign investors and foreign powers. We 
have to make sure they are fully aware, first of all, that we 
can operate the Panama Canal efficiently. We have to get rid of 
Panama's bad name in terms of drugs. We have to do this in 
earnest, not just with lip service or by simply saying we want 
to change. We have to do it with actions. 
  Listen, this has been a family slogan since the first Lewis 
arrived here at the beginning of the 19th Century: Deeds, not 
words. Therefore, I propose to uphold the family motto and to do 
precisely this. I firmly believe that Dr. Perez Balladares, 
more than anyone else, is interested in getting this done. 
  We have to do it quickly, through conversations with the 
U.S. 
Government, the Colombian Government, and the Costa Rican 
Government, which are, for obvious reasons, the countries most 
involved with us in terms of drug trafficking. As soon as we 
begin to take positive steps and have the necessary ties to make 
the international media perceive our country differently, things 
will change quickly. 
  Can you imagine, the other day a French banker came to see 
me 
and said, man, I feel sorry for the Panamanian people. In 
Paris, I heard on television that there had been honest 
elections in Panama. That is great, but the report added that 
Panama is a country whose economy depends, to a large extent, on 
drug trafficking. 
  There is no one to refute this. If we do not assemble a good 
team made up of highly professional people, and if we do not do 
it quickly -- because, as I say, these things have to be changed 
with shock treatment -- we cannot accomplish this on a long-term 
basis. I believe that if Dr. Perez Balladares' government does 
indeed internalize what I am proposing, I think we will change 
our image quickly. 
  Nevertheless, Luz, I cannot go out and say that this lady is 
a virgin, and then have it proven that she lives in a brothel. 
The internal and external image have to be one and the same. I 
hope we can achieve this, because Dr. Perez Balladares has great 
leadership abilities. 
  He has the support of the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary 
Party], the largest political party in the country, which I 
think is convinced that structural changes are needed to improve 
the condition of all Panamanians. The world is headed toward 
the globalization of markets, toward a number of ecological 
changes, and toward the improvement of its inhabitants through 
education. 
  Just take the case of Costa Rica. While we are dealing with 
all these issues, Costa Rica has been advancing, has been taking 
advantage of the situation. Costa Rica has embassies that are 
always looking for business prospects. They have attracted an 
enormous amount of foreign investments. The last time I was 
there, I learned that Costa Ricans estimate they have $100 
million in investments for reforestation. The production of 
energy has become a problem for the ozone layer. When 
electricity is generated, certain gases are released into the 
atmosphere and one method of fighting this is to make the world 
green again. The investment in reforestation in the United 
States is tax deductible, and Costa Rica has skillfully managed 
to make investments in reforestation in Costa Rica also tax 
deductible. Consequently, many investors from affected 
companies have moved to Costa Rica with pleasure because of the 
peaceful atmosphere and the democracy that reigns in that 
country, a democracy that we have just recently acquired. So we 
are on the right path. 
  [Noli] Mr. Lewis, you are an entrepreneur. You are a 
businessman. Now you are going to be the foreign minister. How 
are you going to reconcile being a businessman in the private 
sector and suddenly being a government official in such a 
delicate position as the foreign minister? 
  [Lewis] Luz, first of all I want to say that I am going to 
organize a group of talented people about me. It is the same as 
when you are going to establish a new business. A large part of 
the success of a new business is the people with whom you 
surround yourself. This is one of the reasons I have always 
organized businesses by surrounding myself with specialists. I 
asked Dr. Omar Jaen to be my deputy minister because he is very 
talented, very well educated, and very respected by the 
diplomatic corps. He will attend to all those things in which I 
am ignorant but in which he has an overabundance of knowledge. 
I have also asked Dr. Jaen to begin a specialized study of the 
characteristics of each embassy, what is required, an outline of 
the type of ambassador that should be assigned there. I do not 
want ambassadors assigned because they are so-and-so's uncle, 
brother, or son, but people who can represent Panama in the 
exterior as it should be represented. 
  I was very ashamed the other day when a very prestigious 
diplomat of a friendly country, who came to observe the 
elections, talked at length with me, and told me that his 
foreign office was very upset with Panama. I asked him why. He 
said because of the quality of ambassadors we send them. 
  Our ambassadors are very poorly paid. They are people who 
wind up in all kinds of activities, all the way from drug 
trafficking to the illegal sale of cars. These people ruin our 
country's image. I do not agree that our embassies should be 
only for people with large resources. Of course, there are some 
rich people who are very well qualified, but there are also 
people who are not well off but who can represent Panama with 
pride. I do not want to reinvent the wheel. Around the world, 
there are diplomats from every country and you do not hear a 
scandal about them -- that they smuggled cigarettes into the 
country, that they were involved in drug trafficking, or that 
they falsify and sell passports -- for the simple reason that 
those countries pay their foreign representatives salaries in 
keeping with the economic situation of each one of them. And 
this practice is generalized. 
  We are one of the few countries in which the ambassador to a 
certain country, if he is the president's friend or the foreign 
minister's friend, will try to get extra money from another fund 
or from an autonomous institution. That has to be stopped. I 
was talking with a Panamanian career diplomat who told me that 
what is important is to reorganize this ministry so that things 
are done as they are done in other countries. There is a report 
which the World Bank updates every three months, and another 
from the IMF which indicates the cost of living in every 
country. Those in charge of forwarding the salaries and 
representational expenses to the embassies and diplomats abroad 
abide by these reports automatically. If the cost of living goes 
up in Buenos Aires or goes down in Tegucigalpa or Tokyo, the 
salaries go hand in hand with these changes. You cannot send an 
ambassador to a certain country and have his salary be 
insufficient to cover his rent. 
  [Noli] What you are saying is that the people who will 
represent the country do not necessarily have to be career 
diplomats. You are also talking about a complete reorganization 
of the Foreign Ministry and of the salary allotments for each 
post. Is that what you are saying? 
  [Lewis] I believe we need a general reorganization. To 
accomplish that I need the president's support, which of course 
I already have, and I also need support from the legislative 
branch. When it is time to discuss the Foreign Ministry, they 
must understand that we need to include the element of floating 
costs, which is something we have never seen here. If we do 
not, we will continue to have a unrespected diplomatic corps. I 
need them out there as vehicles for promotion of our country. 
That is why I want to look at the kind of image our ambassadors 
will need to project to each country. I do not want to send 
someone just because his wife cannot stand him or because he has 
no way of paying for his son's university, in which case the 
Human Resource Education and Training Institute should offer him 
a grant or a scholarship. 
  We say we are a privileged nation, thanks to our 
geographical 
position. Our geographical position means nothing if we do not 
have the right people. Let us prepare them. That is why I want 
to bring scholarships from abroad. Take Singapore, for example. 
They have the same population as we do and they are one of the 
richest nations in the world today. It has nothing to do with 
geographical position, that is absurd. It is because of its 
people's capability. This was only possible over time, mind you, 
as this could never be achieved overnight. I may not even 
witness it here, but you will, because you are quite young. 
  [Noli] [Laughing] How diplomatic you are! 
  [Lewis] Just think. The government of Singapore will pay all 
the expenses of anyone who is admitted to one of the top ten 
U.S. universities; MIT, Harvard, Stanford, or the like. The 
person agrees to return to Singapore and work for the government 
or private enterprise. The individual becomes a capital 
investment for Singapore. Frankly speaking, after a few years 
we could go out into the world and sell Pananamian capability, 
then all kinds of enterprises will set up shop here. 
  [Noli] You spoke about the embassies and the kind of 
ambassadors we want. Rumor has it that Jorge Illueca will be at 
the United Nations; Ricardo Alberto Arias will be in Washington; 
Aristides Royo in Paris; Aquilino Boyd in London; and I believe 
the last person to be mentioned for the embassy in Spain was a 
woman. Is this in accordance with what you are saying now? 
  [Lewis] Let me be a little indiscrete with Mr. Perez 
Balladares. Mr. Perez Balladares and I select all of those 
names, except for Spain, but because of diplomatic protocol we 
should not make any announcements until we receive the approval 
from the host countries. The only one I have officially 
announced is Jorge Illueca. Any one of the people you listed 
could be confirmed as ambassador. They are all prominent 
citizens and we can feel proud about the work they will do. I 
am sure all of them clearly understand what Mr. Perez Balladares 
wants. We have to improve the quality of life for Panamanians 
and to do so we must attract foreign investment. He said so in 
Rambala again yesterday. 
  [Noli] You know something? Panama is known for being a 
country of convenience. A short while ago, in the previous 
segment of the program, you told me that in six months we could 
change this country of convenience image. How will you do this 
in so short a time? 
  [Lewis] I do not think I can do what you mention about 
Panama 
as a country of convenience. I mean the image of a country 
involved in drug trafficking, a country with a corrupt 
government. The country of convenience concept originated in 
1936, when Dr. Harmodio Arias decreed that ships from other 
countries could be registered in Panama to lower their costs. 
That is much more complex and I have not even thought about it. 
I am not thinking about Paris or Tokyo newscasts doing us harm. 
What I want is to portray Panama as a safe country for 
investment. 
  The most important thing is to have a democratically elected 
government. This is a priority requirement. If this is 
present, I am sure that Perez Balladares' team will quickly 
improve the Panamanian people's condition. But we need 
everyone's cooperation. One other thing, and this includes 
you, too. In a country trying to attract foreign investment, 
such as Costa Rica, there are agreements among all political 
forces. When it comes to attracting foreign capital, the 
government and the opposition will work in harmony. Some things 
must be accomplished by the government and the opposition 
working together. I think Mrs. Mireya de Gruber will be the 
opposition leader here. At some time, President Perez 
Balladares will have to sit down with her and say to her: We 
need this strategy to improve the Panamanian people's condition, 
but we need your cooperation. This is what civilized countries 
do. Let us not throw rocks at one another because it will be 
the sons and grandchildren of Balladares and Mrs. Mireya who 
will be hurt. We must move Panama forward. It is easy, 
provided we work together. 
  [Noli] Tell me something, Mr. Gabriel. How will you 
implement this strategy you have outlined, considering that PRD 
is the government's political basis and, during the last years 
of what Juan Materno Vasquez describes as the ancienne regime, 
you were one of the most articulate opponents of the government 
led by Noriega? 
  [Lewis] Very simple, Luz. As in every other party, in the 
PRD there are very good people and there are useless people, who 
have not distinguished themselves in any of the ways I have 
mentioned to you. The majority of the PRD people, nevertheless, 
agree with this criterion. I have talked with many of them. 
Remember, I worked closely with Gen. Torrijos and I am well 
acquainted with the PRD people, some of whom are very good. The 
bad thing is that the military had taken over the PRD and had 
taken the party prisoner, so to speak. I think those who most 
benefited from Noriega's ouster were the PRD members who are now 
free to lead a party independently. Previously, however, the PRD 
people were under the military's authority. For instance, one 
colonel might say: This is the policy. The PRD people are full 
of pride and self-esteem. Now they feel free, most of them at 
least. 
  [Noli] Tell me something. Has a true effort been made during 
the Endara administration toward Panama's integration with 
Central America? To what extent will this new relationship that 
you intend to establish affect what has been done so far? 
  [Lewis] Fortunately, as far as I know, the pledges made by 
the Endara government had to do with political and cultural 
agreements only. There is no agreement with Central America for 
economic integration. I say fortunately because, should we 
enter an economic market with Central America, we would be at a 
disadvantage. We would have to equate tariffs on all products 
with those established by the other Central American countries. 
Unlike the other Central American countries, we have a hard 
currency, the U.S. dollar. No industry would be established 
here. All of them would move to Tegucigalpa or San Salvador, 
where labor cost are far lower than in our capital. 
Consequently, the social cost of our incorporation into Central 
America would be similar to incorporating into NAFTA for the 
benefits that would be provided by a truly large market. We 
would have to pay a high social price and no additional jobs 
would be created in Panama. 
  [Noli] Pardon me for interrupting, Mr. Gabriel. I am under 
the impression that the new approach of industrialized countries 
is as a bloc. For instance, NAFTA is made up of the United 
States, Mexico, and Canada. 
  [Lewis] I can tell you a story. Guillermo Chapman, the new 
planning minister, has always had a dream. Panama is very 
fortunate for his having accepted the appointment because he has 
devoted his life to studying everything related to improving the 
Panamanian people's standard of living. Dr. Chapman visited me 
several times while I was in exile. One of the main topics we 
discussed was Panama's incorporation into the U.S. market. 
NAFTA had not yet come into being. After the invasion took 
place, Dr. Chapman and I discussed in depth the possibility of 
proposing to the United States the signing of a free trade 
agreement with Panama as part of a compensation. NAFTA had not 
been created. Can you imagine what would have happened had we 
incorporated ourselves into that market as part of the 
compensation? That would have been quite a different story. 
Panamanians would enjoy stable jobs and better living 
conditions. And there was a good climate for this proposal. We 
requested the current government file a request with President 
Bush, who would address the Congress to ask for compensation for 
Panama. But Congress never responded to our request. This was 
very frustrating for Dr. Chapman and I. 
  I am sure, however, that, if we act with the new diplomacy 
that I intend to use.... [pauses] I have come to this ministry, 
not to get acquainted with people, but precisely because I know 
people. Since I am convinced of the value of interpersonal 
relations, I would like Panama to have an opportunity to advance 
this idea, but not as part of a bloc because the reasons for 
including Panama in it are not valid. On the one hand, we do 
not have their type of economy. On the other, we do not have 
special relations with one of the partners, the United States. 
  But I would like Panama to have a rapprochement with 
Mexico. Mexico is our big brother. Mexico has implemented 
radical economic changes, and it constitutes a good example for 
us to follow. I am confident that the Mexicans, with whom we 
had very strained relations until recently, will soon become our 
big brothers again. Hopefully, Mexico and the United States 
will help us make a serious attempt to establish formal 
relations with Canada. We have virtually no relations with 
Canada since this country has no consulate or embassy in Panama, 
and all procedures must be conducted through Costa Rica. 
Establishing high-level relations with Canada would be one of 
our priorities. 
  We are outlining the path -- as if we were managing a 
business -- we will follow to attain success. Dr. Chapman will 
play a leading role regarding the economy. I will be one of his 
instruments abroad to ensure the success of this endeavor. You 
are going to like the way we are going to work because the media 
and public relations element play a significant role in this 
entire project. We must have the support of all Panamanians, 
including the opposition, the government, the media, the people, 
everybody, to get Panama out of this mess. 
  [Noli] Central American integration will not take place 
until 
the EEC decides to allocate the funds assigned to specific 
geographic areas. The funds have been earmarked for a specific 
geographic area called Central America, which implies that we 
could be part of that bloc. If we are not in the bloc, how will 
relations with the EEC be managed? 
  [Lewis] The cost of joining that group and receiving those 
EEC funds, which are not that substantial either, is high 
because it deprives us of our capacity to negotiate directly 
with the United States. We must seek to preserve our bilateral 
relations with the United States rather than join any bloc. We 
should not join a regional bloc only because of the money 
Europeans will be giving out. The United States may like Panama 
very much, but if they can unload us by our joining a regional 
bloc, I believe they would be most happy to do it. I would feel 
the same way if I were in charge of U.S. foreign policy. What 
we must do is avoid that situation. This does not mean we want 
to offend any Central American nation, they understand us 
perfectly. I have talked to former Central American presidents 
such as Daniel Oduber, who is a dear friend of mine. They are 
truly aware that our situation and that our economy is different 
from their economies. 
  [Noli] How will you tackle our relations with the Far East, 
namely Japan, especially now that Japan's situation vis-a-vis 
the United States has changed to such an extent that President 
Clinton is doing everything within his power to make 
U.S.-Japanese relations as harmonious and convenient for his 
nation as possible? 
  [Lewis] I repeat, we are very lucky. I have traveled to 
Japan on many occasions; I have very good friends in Japan. The 
Japanese know that Panama cannot be treated as part of a bloc 
because Panama has a canal. Japanese trade depends heavily on 
the transit of vessels through the canal. We must capitalize on 
this. Japan is a difficult country to deal with, but there are 
specialists. We must specialize people. As I said, we must 
define the profile of each delegation we send to a particular 
country. The ambassador that we will send to Japan cannot have 
the same characteristics as the one who has to deal with the 
British. We must specialize. We must take into account the 
idiosyncrasies of each people. 
  Moreover, I expect PRC traffic through the canal to increase 
in the early 21st century. We must begin to establish the 
necessary links with them. The Chinese are building what is 
thought will become one of the world's largest merchant marines. 
We must update ourselves. We must look ahead, we must plan 
what we will be doing in the year 2010, as serious countries 
would. 
  The other day, Luz Maria, I visited a learning center in the 
United States that is drafting a plan on how medicines will be 
sold in the year 2010 and the pilot for this plan cost $150 
million. The world knows that the clock does not stop. 
Everything stopped here, absolutely everything. The 
self-esteem of Panamanians dropped. I do not like this at all. 
We must raise our self-esteem. We must accomplish this by 
telling the people that we will overcome our problems if we all 
work together. 
  The first step was taken last week when Mr. (Harold 
Bernstein) of Petroterminales visited Panama, and in the company 
of Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares, they announced investments of 
over $100 million. This is the most important foreign investment 
in the past 10 years. 
  [Noli] But tell me something, to do all those things we need 
money. High self-esteem and jobs are obtained with money, but 
it seems that there is a connection there. What will you do to 
achieve this harmony? 
  [Lewis] When I started to work, I did not have money for 
gasoline for my car. I did not steal one real [five centesimos] 
from anyone, but I managed to provide a comfortable life for my 
family. Luz Maria, improving Panama's image will help local 
commerce because people will not come to Panama if they feel 
that their safety is jeopardized. No one wants to come to 
Panama or get established in Panama due to the links to drug 
trafficking. 
  Commerce and the Colon Free Zone will benefit if we manage 
to 
clean the country's image. I mean the honest ones in the Free 
Zone because we must get rid of the bad ones. I am sure that if 
we appeal to them, we will be able to raise a certain amount of 
money, say 1 or 2 million [not further specified] or whatever is 
required to move forward and sell [words indistinct]. Our plan 
seeks to build a new Panama within five years. We want to 
ensure that we will have many things established along our 
coastlines come the year 1999, when we will have to takeover the 
canal. We need to open up to the world. 
  President Carter, with whom I have a very great personal 
friendship, and who heads the Carter Research Center, told me 
the other day: I am quite fascinated by these elections. I have 
not seen cleaner elections than Panama's. 
  I would be willing to establish a team of people to invite 
to 
a seminar, figures from around the world who have business with 
the canal, to let them see the birth of a new Panama, that we 
have allies, that there are people who love us. 
  [Noli] Dear viewers, this was a conversation with the man 
who 
will lead the foreign policy of the Republic of Panama beginning 
on 1 September.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella stressed that the UK 
obstructs the relationship with the national government when it 
expresses doubts about Argentina's attitude concerning military 
re-equipment. 
  The minister asked the U.S. Government to intercede with the 
UK in a gesture of political trust, to improve relations between 
the two countries. 
  Nevertheless, Di Tella made it clear that trade relations 
with the UK are excellent. But he stressed: We are in a very 
bad mood over the embargo imposed on Argentina concerning the 
re-equipment of its Armed Forces. 
  The Argentine foreign minister also confirmed the decision 
to 
remove the mines installed in the Malvinas Islands during the 
1982 military conflict. 
  Here is a report from (Gaston Sulage): 
  [Begin recording] [(Sulage)] Thank you very much. Today, 
Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella opened a round of talks at San 
Martin Palace between Argentine Foreign Ministry and U.S. State 
Department officials with a broad agenda, basically including 
issues linked to bilateral and regional security. 
  Foreign Minister Di Tella addressed Thomas McNamara, U.S. 
State Department acting principal secretary for 
political-military affairs [title as heard], and U.S. Ambassador 
to Argentina James Cheek. Here are Di Tella's remarks: 
  [Di Tella] Have we managed to transmit the image of a 
peaceful and cooperative Argentina to the world only to a 
certain extent, as there is a country that is your and our ally 
that doubts this image, namely the UK. 
  This is a very important issue for us. The UK not only 
blocks material equipment like spare parts for a Rolls-Royce 
turbine or airplanes, an issue that was discussed and for which 
we are very grateful for the final decision you made, but 
obstructs in a different way by expressing doubts about the 
Argentine Republic. And the UK is a key country in the Western 
alliance. 
  I actually believe the UK does not harbor any doubts. It 
(?depends) on a disabling bureaucracy. It is hard to find a 
bureaucrat who changes his or her opinion and takes the 
initiative of saying dismissed [preceding word in English] on an 
issue that has been dragging on for 12 years. 
  Nevertheless, this is a problem that bothers us a lot, not a 
bit, but a lot. And I believe you can do a lot -- not a bit -- 
to end it. 
  I believe you have made a great effort concerning the 
Skyhawk 
issue. We appreciate your effort, not only as a material 
gesture, but as a political gesture of trust, which actually is 
what really counts. 
  We believe that the UK is allowing this issue to fade away. 
It has its own internal lobbies [preceding word in English] and 
does not want to appear one day saying: We have discontinued 
the embargo. 
  Nevertheless, the embargo really puts us in a bad mood, in 
an 
extremely bad mood. Either the embargo is really justified or 
else it involves people who read the newspapers every 10 years, 
as there has been an overwhelming wealth of data here. Those 
who do not want to acknowledge this overwhelming wealth of data 
on a new Argentina at the international level are not aware of 
what is happening in Argentina. 
  [(Sulage)] Di Tella also made it clear that the relationship 
between Argentina and the UK is ambivalent because it is 
surprisingly perfect commercially and culturally. 
  This was a report by (Gaston Sulage) over Radio Nacional.

  The Economy Ministry has approved 9.5 million pesos in petty 
cash for the Presidential Secretariat, the Natural Resources 
Secretariat, the Drug Abuse Prevention Secretariat, the Science 
and Technology Secretariat, the Social Development Secretariat, 
and the Public Function Secretariat. (Buenos Aires CLARIN in

  On 19 May, business sources reported that Germany has 
implemented trade sanctions against Argentina for its delay in 
paying $7 billion in interest to the Paris Club. 
Argentine-German Chamber of Commerce sources indicated that the 
sanctions include the suspension of German loans, which are 
worth $300 million per year, to finance bilateral trade exports. 
The overdue interest involves loans contracted with German 
banks within the Paris Club to finance the Yacyreta 
hydroelectric dam project and the Atucha nuclear power plant 
project. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1331 GMT 19 May 94)

  [Text] Santiago, 24 May (EFE) -- Chilean businessmen fear 
that the labor and environmental demands that various U.S. 
organizations want to introduce into a free trade agreement with 
Chile would leave this country out of the competition. 
  Jose Antonio Guzman, president of the Production and Trade 
Confederation, said that the demands being rejected by Chilean 
businessmen are sectoral collective negotiation and mandatory 
unionization, which have already been left behind in Chile. 
  The businessmen also reject the environmental regulations 
for 
production, which according to Guzman exceed the Chilean 
capabilities of investment, and is a requirement that is not 
even met in the United States. 
  Guzman made this comment to local journalists after 
returning 
from the United States, where he contacted various U.S. 
organizations, including union leaders. 
  Regarding the talks he had held, Guzman said he perceived 
strong pressure to impose the labor and environmental 
regulations in the future free trade agreement to be negotiated 
between Chile and the United States. 
  In reference to the environmental demands, Guzman said: "We 
have to be very careful and alert, because a clause of 
protectionism under the disguise of protecting our interests 
could be introduced, which is logically something we will not 
accept." 
  Regarding the labor clauses, Guzman said the two suggested 
regulations have already been left behind in Chilean labor 
legislation, and that business is not willing to reincorporate 
them "because they are harmful to various labor sectors and 
consumers." 
  He added that Chilean business is willing to reach an 
agreement with the United States, but only, he added, "if it is 
beneficial for the country, and does not impose environmental or 
labor regulations that exceed Chilean capabilities and leave us 
out of the competition." 
  Guzman explained that his organization is studying the 
advantages and disadvantages of joining NAFTA, or the 
possibility of a free trade agreement with the United States. 
  Guzman said the businessmen will thoroughly study the two 
choices before issuing a declaration. 
  Chile and the United States reaffirmed their decision to 
sign 
a free trade agreement, to be defined during the negotiations.

  [Text] Santiago, 24 May (EFE) -- Chilean Foreign Minister 
Carlos Figueroa said today that the country is "very calm and 
very confident" about the results of the defense it made before 
the arbitration tribunal that will establish the borderline in 
Laguna del Desierto. He also denied Argentine reports of an 
alleged "territorial barter deal." 
  The minister emphatically denied Buenos Aires press reports 
that Argentina had assured for itself a favorable decision in 
the dispute, and that in compensation Chile would be granted 
some territories in the continental glacier zone, which is also 
under dispute. 
  "The two areas are being considered in an absolutely 
independent manner, and there is no link whatsoever between the 
conversations or negotiations over the arbitration in Laguna del 
Desierto and the treaty that was proposed for the continental 
glacier zone," Figueroa said. 
  "We are very calm and very confident in the defense Chile 
has 
made of its interests before the international tribunal, and 
what we will do now is wait for the decision," the minister 
added. 
  He said that the decision on Laguna del Desierto is unlikely 
to be made before the end of the year. 
  He reiterated that Chile and Argentina have no pending 
border 
problems, recalling that in October 1991 the presidents of the 
two nations resolved 22 of the 24 border disputes. 
  On that occasion, only the Laguna del Desierto dispute was 
left unresolved, and it was decided to submit the matter to 
arbitration, while a solution -- which must be ratified by 
Congress in the two countries -- was reached for the continental 
glacier zone. 
  He added that the Peace and Friendship Treaty that the two 
countries signed in 1984 has mechanisms for finding consensus 
solutions through juridical channels for any difficulty that may 
appear during the ongoing border negotiations. 
  Figueroa reiterated that Chile had made "a very good 
defense" 
before the international tribunal, which is headed by Colombian 
jurist Rafael Nieto and includes four other Latin American 
jurists. 
  The disputed territory in Laguna del Desierto covers a bit 
more than 500 square kilometers between parallel 62 south [as 
received] and Mt. Fitz Roy. 
  Minister Figueroa also announced that on 8 June he will 
travel to Argentina to start negotiations in search for a 
formula for a partnership with the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur) countries.

  [Excerpt] Brussels, 25 May (EFE) -- Chilean Agricultural 
Minister Emiliano Ortega said today that the agreement reached 
with the European Union (EU) to export apples and pears "will 
allow higher" prices to enter the European market and alleviate 
"the high tariffs" affecting Chilean fruits. 
  "This agreement is extremely important, as it inaugurates a 
more normal relationship with the EU," said Ortega, after 
signing the agreement with Rene Steichen, European agricultural 
official, at the EU headquarters in Brussels. 
  The agreement reached last week in Brussels is temporary, 
until the commitments of the Uruguay Round of the GATT talks -- 
which are improved in this agreement -- go into effect in 1995. 
  Chile promised to immediately withdraw the charges submitted 
to GATT against the European Community regulation on the 
importation of apples and pears with reference prices and 
compensatory rates penalizing the low price imports. 
  As a result of the Chilean-EU agreement, the tariffs Chile 
had to pay on its exports of apples and pears have been reduced 
by half. Therefore, the current tariff of 6 percent for apples 
drops to 3 percent and the tariff of 4 percent for pears drops 
to 2 percent. 
  The agreement also established that the entrance price of 
these fruits can drop to 12 percent (it is currently 8 percent) 
below the European reference price without receiving the penalty 
of the highest EU tariff (54 percent), but rather a lower tariff 
of 11 percent. 
  The basis to be taken into account for the overall 
calculation of the entrance prices of apples and pears into the 
EU will also be 60 percent of the total amount at the lowest 
sale prices, instead of the current 30 percent. 
  In addition, after Chilean apples' absence from the price 
list on the European market for four days (instead of the 
current six), the compensatory rate will be eliminated. 
  Steichen expressed his satisfaction over a "friendly 
solution" having been found to this conflict, which began in 
September 1993 when Chile decided to file charges. [passage

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 26 May (AE) -- Foreign Minister Celso 
Amorim and Industry Ministry officials are debating the creation 
of legislation to allow the Brazilian Government to stem big 
flows of imported products. Amorim is concerned about the 
excessive importation of some products following the opening of 
the economy. Under the new legislation, the Industry Ministry 
might establish quotas on products for which importation is 
considered excessive. During a GAZETA MERCANTIL-sponsored 
seminar entitled "The New Map of World Commerce," Amorim 
emphasized that Brazil must have appropriate instruments to 
fight commercial dumping. The minister said the U.S. Department 
of Commerce has 600 employees working in the anti-dumping area, 
while Brazil has only four or five professionals.

<F P=106> [Article by Celso Pinto from Sao Paulo] </F>
  [Text] Brazil currently has a record level of foreign 
reserves and one of the most generous trade surpluses in the 
world. This solid foreign trade front faces, however, two 
problems that might complicate the situation. 
  Nearly two-thirds of foreign exchange reserves today consist 
of short-term commercial loans that are renewable every six 
months. Furthermore, there has been a heavy rush to collect 
export revenues in advance and to delay import-related debts. 
This has resulted in a significant gap between accounts 
concerning actual shipments of merchandise and financial 
accounts. 
  The actual foreign trade balance should stand at $4.9 
billion 
by the end of May. Foreign trade balance figures, however, are 
expected to reach $13 billion. The $8.1 billion difference 
comprises commercial loans to finance imports and export 
revenues collected in advance. 
  In other words, because there has been such a major increase 
in this financing, the figures include a great deal of exports 
that will not bring revenues in the next few months and imports 
that will have to be paid for later. As it is unlikely that 
commercial loans will continue to grow at the same pace as they 
have since the last quarter of 1993, the reserves will drop even 
if the level of the trade balance is maintained, which is 
unlikely if a fixed exchange rate is established upon the 
implementation of the real in July. 
  All these figures and analyses were supplied by economist 
Fernando Montero of the MB Associates consulting firm. His 
conclusion is not catastrophic, but it serves as a warning. 
  Irrespective of the political situation, foreign currency 
reserves will decelerate during the second half of 1994 because 
of the financial advances already reflected in the trade 
balance. Montero estimates that reserves currently stand at $40 
billion -- an all time record. 
  The other possible conclusion is more delicate. If Montero's 
figures are correct, short-term commercial loans today total $27 
billion; that is, they account for two-thirds of the foreign 
currency reserves. These loans are renewable every six months 
and are obviously sensitive to the degree to which the country 
is trustworthy. If the presidential succession raises serious 
distrust regarding the debt issue, these loans could rapidly 
decline as happened in the past. 
  Montero notes that the latest report released by the Central 
Bank (BC) on short-term commercial debt is dated March 1992. 
This report officially estimates that the short-term commercial 
debt would total $15.7 billion by December 1992. According to 
BC figures, short-term loans increased by $5.4 billion in 1992. 
  This figure is quite close to Montero's estimate of $5.2 
billion for 1992. Comparing the trade balance figure with the 
total amount of foreign currency used in foreign trade 
operations, the difference should account for foreign financing 
of foreign trade. 
  These short-term commercial loans have increased 
substantially since 1991, but the largest increases began in 
October 1993. Exporters have good reasons for wanting to 
collect their revenues in advance, while importers seek to 
finance their costs. 
  Montero cites three of these reasons: First, the sudden 
increase in real domestic interest rates. This has made it very 
advantageous to transform dollars into cruzeiros and to invest 
them on the financial market. More recently, another reason is 
the fear of a delay in correcting the exchange rate if, as 
expected, the government decides to fix the exchange rate for 
three or four months after the implementation of the real, or 
for as long as there is residual inflation. 
  The third reason suggested by Montero is the restriction 
imposed last year on foreign investment in fixed-term 
certificates in Brazil through the so-called Annex 4. As a 
result of this, banks have had greater levels of funds available 
to finance foreign trade. Moreover, it is obvious that the 
international banks had the funds available and were interested 
in granting commercial loans to Brazil. This can be explained 
by the large profitability and guarantees offered by these loans. 
  Montero's figures show there has been an increase of nearly 
$16 billion in the volume of short-term commercial loans since 
the end of 1991. This explains roughly two-thirds of the 
increase in foreign reserves during that same period. Montero 
believes the net balance of financial investment within the 
framework of the exchange operations market has been relatively 
small since 1991: $200 million in 1992; $1.3 billion last year; 
and $600 million from January to May. This falls short of 
explaining the sudden increase in foreign reserves, even if we 
consider financial investments and the trade balance separately. 
  The difference between the overall commercial exchange 
operations and the effective trade balance (shipments) totalled 
$4.1 billion in 1991; $5.2 billion in 1992; and a surprisingly 
high $8.1 billion from January to May of this year. 
  It is very probable that the enormous volume of export 
revenues collected in advance will begin to decrease as of July. 
Changes in the amount and type of commercial loans to be 
granted will depend on several factors. 
  Before the debt crisis, the volume of short-term commercial 
loans totalled nearly $15 billion. By the time the creditor 
banks' obligation to maintain these credit lines ended as a 
result of the old "Project 3," which was part of the 
negotiations held with the banks, this volume had decreased by a 
little more than 50 percent. 
  The recovery of the country's credibility in the 
international financial community and the extremely high 
profitability of these operations since then has prompted the 
international banks to resume granting short-term commercial 
loans. These loans will continue to be granted for as long as 
the international financial market trusts Brazil. The fact that 
they are renewable after an extremely short term, however, makes 
the situation rather vulnerable to substantial changes in the 
market evaluation of the risks involved in investing in Brazil.

"Displeasure"] 
  [Text] Lawrence Summers, U.S. Treasury under secretary for 
international affairs, went right to the point in his talks with 
Workers Party [PT] economists. 
  After announcing that the U.S. Government will respect the 
outcome of the Brazilian elections irrespective of who the 
winner is, Summers conveyed all his displeasure. He said: "I 
have talked with some 15 bankers and they have all expressed 
concern" about what they heard during PT presidential candidate 
Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's visit to the United States. "It was 
a tough conversation," economist Jorge Matoso said, "or frank, 
as Itamaraty would say."

  [Text] If it wins the elections, the PT [Workers Party] 
will impose a temporary tax on large fortunes, in order to 
create a fund destined to finance projects for the creation of a 
large number of jobs. This information was supplied yesterday 
to FOLHA by economist Jose Marcio Camargo, one of the designers 
of the party economic policy. 
  The tax, which will be collected only in 1996, is one of the 
sources of money that the PT intends to use to create 8 million 
jobs during its government term. The party also intends to 
transfer 10 million workers from the informal to the formal 
sector of the economy. 
  According to Camargo, the fund to be created with the tax on 
fortunes will feed on the profits of the investments that were 
made. 
  Camargo added that another fund, which will be created in 
1996, will serve the same purpose, but no decision has yet been 
made on the source from which the money for it will be obtained. 
  Before creating this fund, the government will reportedly 
finance infrastructure projects for creating jobs with money 
from the budget and from social funds. 
  PT economists were due to meet last night in Rio de Janeiro, 
under federal PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Aloizio Mercadante, to 
debate the program for jobs creation and the party macroeconomic 
program.

approximately 1100 in the Granizal section of Medellin set fire 
to approximately 10 buses, causing damage amounting to 115 
million pesos. The peace agreement is between the government

northwestern communities. [passage omitted] 
  With the support of the Army and the police, urban bus 
services are gradually being restored to Medellin and the 
surrounding communities. Currently the Granizal area is 
cordoned off and heavily militarized. After 1000 this morning 
in Granizales, during an event led by Government Minister Fabio 
Villegas Ramirez, the peace agreement will be signed by three of 
Medellin's five popular militias. This translates into the 
demobilization and disarmament of approximately 650 men from the 
three armed groups. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1318 GMT on 26 May reports that 
three taxis and 10 buses were burned. No injuries or fatalities 
were reported. The report says that bus service in Medellin has 
been drastically reduced because of fear among bus drivers and 
owners that their vehicles might be targeted, adding that 
authorities believe that the escalation of guerrilla activities 
is related to the 29 May elections.]

  [Text] In the last three years, part of the fortune of the 
Valle drug lords has been invested in giving financial support 
to a number of Colombian political leaders. 
  This affirmation is contained in a report on Colombian drug 
trafficking given to Italian authorities by Fernando Brito, 
director of the Administrative Department of Security [DAS], two 
weeks ago. The report claims that after the dismembering of the 
Medellin Cartel, the Valle mafia has consolidated its power to 
such an extent that it controls 75 percent of all drugs shipped 
from Colombia to the U.S. and European markets. 
  The report says that in the last decade other organizations 
have created veritable industries in which departmentalized 
networks are involved in the process of obtaining raw materials, 
processing, internal transportation, and international drug 
trafficking. The fortunes of these organizations have 
infiltrated the construction industry, drugstore chains, radio 
stations, automobile dealerships, department stores, factories, 
banks, sports clubs, and even investment firms. 
  The report claims that the drug trafficking organizations 
run 
a large number of offices in the United States and Europe that 
handle hard currency derived from drug trafficking. However, 
the Valle mafia is outstanding because of a "managerial 
organization with business criteria and decentralization." The 
report states that at present the Valle drug lords are not 
participating in cocaine exports but that they receive a 
percentage of the shipments of other drug traffickers for the 
use of distribution routes and networks under their control. 
The analysis indicates that complementing the support of 
political leaders, a large part of drug trafficking money is 
invested in real estate; another part is exchanged into pesos; 
and another large part is deposited in international banks 
abroad. Following that order, the report says, the money sent 
abroad is funneled toward the creation of new front companies 
for drug trafficking operations or into high yield investments 
in the stock market. 
  Other organizations have a marked tendency to launder money 
through fictitious exports using official documents and dummy 
corporations that act as customs agents in the transfer of money 
to Colombia. Currently the organizations have expanded their 
drug trafficking networks abroad and are investing capital in 
casinos, real estate firms, travel agencies, and night clubs in 
various countries in Europe. Thus, drug money has been detected 
in Spain, Luxembourg, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Holland, and even 
in Russia. 
  Other drug cartels send money orders and money transfers 
through agencies in charge of cashing foreign checks and 
receiving foreign payments. It is difficult to trace money 
derived from drug trafficking in these types of operations. In 
internal drug trafficking, the cartels use eight departments to 
ship drugs to the drug distribution centers abroad.

  [Text] Beginning today, bank secrecy will be rescinded in 
cases involving officials under investigation by the Attorney 
General's Office. An agreement signed by the Banking 
Association and the Attorney General's Office is designed to cut 
investigation time by more than half. 
  This agreement will allow authorities to expose current and 
former corrupt officials who grew rich illegally by taking 
advantage of their positions. Until now, the release of banking 
information on customer transactions was banned. 
  [Begin Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta recording] By 
way of this agreement, they will not only provide us with 
information in a timely manner, but they also will participate 
in its analysis to help us understand the flow of assets 
[evolucion patrimonial] and the origins of an individual's 
resources. [end recording] 
  From now on, every bank, savings institution, and other 
financial institution must, as soon as possible, provide all 
information the Attorney General's Office needs to uncover 
illegal enrichment. Meanwhile, the financial institutions think 
this measure is nothing new and that the document is merely a 
commitment to expedite procedures already in place. 
  [Begin Banking Association President Cesar Gonzalez Munoz 
recording] I must stress that this is nothing new. Bank secrecy 
is not being lifted, because this was done years ago in cases 
involving investigations by the Attorney General's Office. [end 
recording] 
  In 1993 and so far in 1994, the Attorney General's Office 
has 
conducted more than 72 investigations into illegal enrichment 
cases involving some 5 billion pesos. The subjects of these 
inquiries are officials working in customs, mayoral and 
gubernatorial offices, aeronautics, police services, and the 
Army.

<F P=106> [By Miriam Mercado] </F>
  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 24 May (NOTIMEX) -- The foreign 
ministers of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Panama 
consider it urgent for the OAS to debate Cuba's return to the 
hemispheric organization. 
  Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo told NOTIMEX 
the government of Jose Maria Figueres, who was sworn in on 8 
May, will review its relations with Cuba. "The Cuban people 
have been greatly harmed by a blockade that has lasted many 
decades, and we believe the Cuban problem should be discussed 
within the OAS," Naranjo said. He stated: "In a matter of 
months, Costa Rica will approach the OAS concerning what we 
believe should be a revision of the Cuban situation," the Costa 
Rican minister added. 
  We do not rule out the possibility of analyzing Cuba's 
situation at the next OAS general assembly, which is scheduled 
to be held in Belen do Para, Brazil, from 6 to 10 June, the 
Honduran Foreign Ministry reported. 
  Haiti's problem is another case that must be analyzed within 
the OAS, Naranjo said. The strengthening of the democratic 
system, the human rights issue, and the integration process are 
part of the topics in the agenda for the next OAS general 
assembly in Brazil. 
  Moreover, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal told 
NOTIMEX that, "in Cuba's specific case, the world has changed, 
and we believe Cuba must return to the OAS." 
  Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar said "Cuba is 
a 
brother country that belongs to the American hemisphere and it 
must be reinstated in the OAS." 
  Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero Gonzalez 
said he "disagrees" with the blockade enforced by the United 
States against Cuba for more than 30 years. "The case of the 
Cuban embargo must be discussed at the OAS because this is 
apparently the last remnant of the Cold War redoubt," Cordero 
said. 
  Guatemalan Foreign Minister Marithza Ruiz de Vielman 
emphasized that the president of her country, Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio, has yet to define what position he will adopt concerning 
the Cuban case. 
  Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria revealed 
a position similar to the one adopted by Guatemala when he said 
President Alfredo Cristiani's administration has yet to discuss 
the Cuban issue.

<F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today the daily GRANMA, organ of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, describes the message 
delivered by U.S. President William Clinton on 20 May as 
insulting. 
  Under the title of "Pharisaism," journalist Felix Pita 
Astudillo recalls that today, 92 years after the United States 
installed a government in Cuba, it still wants to maintain 
annexationist ideas with the intention of annexing us, at any 
cost, into its new world order. 
  After pointing out the crudeness of the message's content, 
which seems more like an electoral diatribe directed at Miami 
rather than at Cuba, Pita Astudillo notes that the Cuban people 
are not interested in the freedom advocated by the United States 
because it is inhuman and falls under the every-man-for-himself 
philosophy. 
  The journalist notes that the wishes expressed by Clinton do 
not take into account the right to life, work, education, food, 
health, or housing in either Cuba or its neighboring Latin 
American countries. There is no reference whatsoever to the 
eradication of poverty, which requires well-balanced economic 
development and a better distribution of wealth, and it simply 
deals with age-old and worn-out references to individual civil 
liberties with a vague mention of the state of law. 
  Pita Astudillo describes as cynical the argument in defense 
of the blockade, which is aimed at making it impossible for the 
Cuban people to attain prosperity and satisfy their basic needs 
as well as making us surrender through hunger. 
  The GRANMA article notes that, in his message, President 
Clinton claims Cuba and the United States have a long history of 
cooperation and admiration. Pita Astudillo concedes that 
although this history is indeed long, it is filled with 
voraciousness and disdain toward the immoral dwarfs -- the term 
the North Americans used to describe Cubans in the last century. 
  Finally, the journalist refers to the nerve it took to refer 
to Jose Marti as someone whose ideas are consistent with 
Clinton's policy, when it was precisely Marti who 105 years ago 
wrote: Cuba has never been seen by the United States as anything 
other than an savory possession whose only nuisance is its 
people, whom they view as impetuous, lazy, and loathsome.

  [Text] The Barbados Labor Party says it does not intend to 
take the proposed 8 percent pay cut issue lightly. Opposition 
leader (Owen Arthur) said the laws that allow government to 
interfere with the salaries of public workers as it sees fit are 
bad and offensive. According to the opposition, these laws 
should be removed from the statute books. Mr. (Arthur) says he 
is getting legal advice on the matter, which he intends to put 
before parliament. 
  [Begin (Arthur) recording] Clause 26, which was (read) as a 
basis upon which the government has acted in this instance, was 
recommended as one of those aspects of the Constitution that 
should have been changed. I deeply regret the (?Balisur) Party 
government did not change it then. I deeply regret this was not 
tested for fear... [pauses] only because we fear that because 
the government then did not have a two-thirds majority, or 
because we did not have... [pauses] [words indistinct] it was 
not changed, but it is such an offensive law that it ought to be 
off the statute books of this country.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Interior Minister Ramon Escovar </F>
Salom by Luis Vallenilla; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom said: "No 
political big stick has been used against Carlos Andres Perez." 
Thus, he replied to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who claimed he was 
a personal friend of the jailed former president and attributed 
Perez' current situation to maneuvers by his enemies. 
  "I acknowledge and respect the opinion of a man like Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez, but I do not think he has been adequately 
informed about what has happened in Venezuela," the interior 
minister curtly replied. 
  Escovar argues that Perez was tried with all the appropriate 
guarantees. That trial, he notes, was for embezzlement and 
misappropriation of funds. "It is not at all true that he was 
tried because he is a champion of democracy in America. He has 
not been jailed for the good he has done for democracy but for 
the harm he has caused the nation," Escovar said. 
  Escovar believes this trial "stimulates the moral recovery 
of 
Venezuela and strengthens democratic institutions." 
  Remarking that it was the first time that a president in 
office has ever been tried, Escovar recalled that when he 
initiated his action against Carlos Andres Perez (11 March 
1993), "no one believed it was possible." 
  "Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the action I 
undertook had a solid basis, as evidenced by the fact that the 
Senate unanimously suspeded Carlos Andres Perez from his post. 
Now, an arrest warrant has been issued against him with 10 
votes in favor of the decision and five against." 
  The interior minister believes what some are saying, that 
is, 
that Carlos Andres Perez accepted his arrest while apparently 
rejecting privileges as a maneuver to regain credibility and 
popularity. 
  "The polls indicate that public opinion is against the 
former 
president even while he tries to portray himself as a victim to 
see if he can generate some support. The Democratic Action 
Party National Directorate has just excluded him from the party, 
thereby announcing that his strategy will not work," Escovar 
noted. 
  In Escovar's opinion, Perez is not anyone's victim, much 
less 
a victim of Escovar's alleged rage. "He is the victim of his 
own actions. He is only targeting himself for serious abuse 
when he attempts to personalize the matter by saying that this 
is a hateful conspiracy against him, not a legal action for 
embezzlement and misappropriation of funds. 
<H5>  Relations With Colombia </H5>
  In response to insistent reports that certain Colombian 
sectors support an armed aggression against Venezuela because 
the new president will not fulfill Perez' exaggerated promises, 
especially those involving the Gulf, the interior minister 
affirmed that relations with the neighboring country "are 
excellent." 
  Contrary to the popular opinion that Gaviria's visit was 
highly untimely (among other reasons, because he is about to 
leave office), Escovar said: "It was one of the best 
presidential visits I have seen because it was not an encounter 
of protocol, rhetoric, or pomp and circumstance; it was a 
working meeting." 
  Escovar reiterated that the visit was significant: "Mainly 
because it stimulates a new climate of trust in the mutual 
affairs that demand our attention." 
  In terms of the new climate of trust, the interior minister 
explained that some people in Colombia believed relations 
depended on Perez. Perez, he noted, did more harm than good to 
those relations. Why? Escovar responded: "Because no one in 
Venezuela trusted the way Perez managed relations between the 
two states and the two peoples. Now relations are better 
because no one doubts that the president will manage them 
skillfully and impartially." 
  Nevertheless, we told Escovar that the Venezuelan media 
reported that the meeting with Gaviria concluded with the 
signing of a document of no importance. 
  To this Escovar replied: "There is one point which refutes 
that. The joint declaration signed by the two presidents 
acknowledged the importance illegal aliens have for Venezuela. 
It recognizes that Venezuela is absolutely sovereign on 
deciding who can remain in Venezuela and who cannot." 
  He added that the importance of cooperation between the two 
governments in the immigration problem was stressed. "This 
issue alone justifies the visit by President Gaviria and his 
team. By the way, there are some very brilliant, top-notch 
people on that team." 
  We then mentioned Decree 1911, which allows the 
registration of children born to illegal aliens. Escovar Shalom 
commented: "This was a serious, disturbing problem. I have the 
authority to speak on this because I opposed the decree. I 
asked the Court to annul it, and I asked President Velasquez to 
repeal it, which he did." 
  The interior minister mentioned the ambiguities of the 
decree. The decree granted more privileges to illegal aliens 
than to Venezuelans, who, without proper identification, cannot 
register their children with the vital statistics registrar. 
"It is not a matter of being against Colombians or anyone from 
another nation, it is against illegal aliens," he noted. 
  Escovar was then asked if this irregularity was corrected by 
repealing the decree. The interior minister appeared somewhat 
surprised by the question. Although the legal amparo no longer 
exists, it is still possible that exceptions continue in some 
cases. 
  He jots this down in a notebook and says that a memorandum 
will be sent on the matter, although he does not doubt that 
children continue to be illegally registered as Venezuelans 
through irregular procedures such as forging documents. 
  "Is this one of this government's and the nation's biggest 
problems?" 
  Escovar says he has a great interest in confronting this 
challenge efficiently but that he does not expect miracles. He 
refers to how from the beginning this government was able to 
reduce the number of people killed by firearms over the weekend. 
  "When the Metropolitan Police relaxed, there was a rise in 
the number of deaths. That is now being corrected.... As 
interior minister, I have insisted that the police remain 
deployed on the streets. This means breaking the culture of 
police inertia and bureaucracy.... If the action is not 
consistent, the results won't last," the interior minister 
observed. 
  But what about poverty and the forgotten neighborhoods where 
there is not even a training facility for young people? 
  The interior minister replied: "The problem lies deeper and 
requires coordinated action in the needy neighborhoods with 
neighborhood associations and other organizations. We are 
already doing some of this, but not with the required intensity. 
There are still many setbacks in coordination. The problem 
goes far beyond what statistics and the formal appearances 
disclose. We must get to the bottom of the matter. True 
progress cannot be achieved without prevention and improvement 
in the social conditions and without counting on a new, more 
highly trained police force that is better equipped and has 
ethical values." 
  He was then questioned on how the student bus fare issue was 
finally resolved. He recognized that the subsidy must be 
maintained but administered in another way. "It must not 
generate corruption or conflicts," he remarked. 
<H5>  Caldera's Apparent Inertia </H5>
  Caldera appears to have fallen into inertia. Some say he 
seems to be playing a solitary game of chess. He is neither 
seen nor heard, despite what one would expect of him in a 
situation as difficult as the one the nation is experiencing. 
  Escovar stated: "The president is attentive to the 
government. Just because he does not make many public 
appearances does not mean he is inactive. He is focused on his 
main obligation; that is, to govern..." 
  The minister noted that besides, "his attitude contrasts 
with the verbal hemorrhage [hemorragia verbal] of previous 
years." 
  The interior minister denied Antonio Ledezma's charges that 
now he combats the same hooded individuals he protected as 
prosecutor general. "I always fought them as prosecutor 
general. I have told the students this both privately and 
publicly. As interior minister, I have instructed the police 
throughout the nation to arrest hooded individuals. The law 
should be applied to those of legal age and the provisions in 
the Law on Protection of Minors to minors. 
  Escovar noted that on several occasions he has spoken with 
students in his office. Their leaders have been asked to reject 
the presence of hooded individuals and violence in general. 
  The students say these people are a minority without any 
roots, at least not in the university. They claim that they are 
small groups removed from the student body. At times they are 
joined by high school students. 
  "This is the only time that students have come to this 
office 
to drink coffee and talk with the minister. I told them a few 
days ago they should have rejected the people shooting at the 
police cars just like the government rejected the police officer 
who killed the student from Fermin Toro school." 
  Nevertheless, Escovar acknowledged that in the past, the 
pressure of student and other types of demonstrations had 
lessened. He believes that if the police have put away their 
weapons and adopted a tolerant attitude, the students should 
moderate their impulses and demonstrate in a civilized manner. 
  Returning to hooded individuals, he again insisted that 
there 
is no contradiction between his policy as prosecutor general and 
his policy as minister. 
  "The Presidency has regained its majesty with Dr. Rafael 
Caldera and that is noteworthy. Besides, only three months have 
gone by, and a government cannot be judged after 90 days, much 
less amid a crisis as traumatic as this one." 
  Are changes in the works? 
  Escovar replies that it is not his place to discuss that. He 
mentioned, however, a maneuver to generate friction among the 
ministers and a conspiracy among public office aspirants whose 
expectations were not fulfilled or who were not chosen for the 
positions they sought. 
  "Their goal is to spread all sorts of rumors about the 
ministers." 
  He recommends looking at this "conspiracy" from the 
viewpoint 
of the local culture, as part of the tropical folklore. 
  He adds: "Now, the possibility of change always exists." 
  Rumors (we tell the minister), which recently constituted a 
very popular and exploited tool, were always a recourse, a 
weapon of the population. 
  Escovar notes: "Rumors and gossip are part of 
communication... Sometimes they are free information bulletins." 
  Escovar added that the popular media have become more 
sophisticated. Rumors are not just spread orally, by idle talk, 
anymore. "Now there is the anonymous fax, a vicious tool being 
used to publicize all sorts of maneuvers and which does not 
require many people." 
  Escovar relates how the so-called "Operation Centaur" was 
extensively publicized in this way. Those behind "Operation 
Centaur" claim that Escovar, Jose Vicente Rangel, Rafael Poleo, 
Radical Cause, and others plotted to destabilize bankers and 
businessmen to set up a communist regime in Venezuela. 
  And what is the source of that campaign and those strange 
charges? 
  "Rumors such as those circulated by `Operation Centaur' 
preceded the arrest warrant against Perez. It is obvious that 
there are certain interests and persons who dislike my being 
interior minister." 
<H5>  That Cancer Called the Sectorial General Directorate of </H5>
Identification and Control of Foreigners [Diex] 
  Escovar said that as for the Diex, strict measures are being 
taken. "We need to clean house, to begin and conclude a clean 
operation." With this goal in mind, he has given specific and 
categorical instructions to the new Diex directors. 
  The operation has begun with immigration officials and 
includes an investigation to determine the origins of several 
falsifications and the forgery of documents used to legalize 
visas, residence permits, and other transactions. 
  "The Diex, as it currently operates, does not defend 
Venezuela's national sovereignty." Escovar adds: "I am willing 
to take action against all those people." He explains that it 
is not an easy task, but it will be undertaken, even if most of 
the staff has to be changed." [no opening quotation marks as 
published] 
<H5>  Presidential Aspirations </H5>
  Ramon Escovar Salom, who has been minister four times (twice 
under Carlos Andres Perez himself) and former ambassador to 
France, was constantly mentioned as a presidential hopeful while 
he was prosecutor general. 
  "When some groups offered to promote my candidacy, I 
understood that the time was not right. I did not agree to run 
for first senator of the Federal District, either, and decided 
to remain as prosecutor general." 
  He recalls that many insisted he was doomed to fail when he 
became prosecutor general. His opponents now make similar or 
worse predictions, perhaps because people know he acts 
independently and fear he will unveil a few crimes. 
  Let me remind you of the failure of many other interior 
ministers. Right now, one of them is in prison with Carlos 
Andres Perez. "But I am not the executor of other people's 
failures... Those who are dying to see me fail as interior 
minister will be disappointed. This applies to those I call the 
authors of the bogeyman." 
  Does that mean you are not afraid that the position will 
wear 
you out? 
  "Before they claimed I was preparing my presidential 
campaign, now they say I am burying it because I accepted this 
ministry." 
  What do you think? 
  "Conjectures do not always match the facts. The well-worn 
expression neither one nor the other but quite the opposite 
comes to mind." 
  He recalled that in addition to the offers to run for 
president or senator, he was offered the post of international 
prosecutor (the equivalent of UN under secretary general, with a 
$14,000 salary) to try Yugoslavian war criminals. 
  "It was not like I did not have anything better to do, but I 
believed my duty was to stay here and accept President Caldera's 
offer. 
  What is your goal? 
  "That is unpredictable. Just remember how Christopher 
Columbus sailed for the East and ended up reaching the West." 
  But is that the way to reach the presidency? 
  "It is not necessarily a way, but it is not an obstacle, 
either."

  [Text] Lima, 25 May (EFE) -- Peruvian military planes have 
intercepted two small Colombian planes in the department of 
Ucayali, in the Peruvian jungle, forcing them to land, police 
sources reported today. 
  The two small planes, which were intercepted by Peruvian Air 
Force planes, landed at an illegal airstrip in the Boca Apua 
zone and were set on fire by the crew, after which the alleged 
drug traffickers escaped into the jungle. 
  Military troops and two judges later went to the illegal 
airstrip and destroyed it [as received], the sources said. 
  The illegal airstrips in the Peruvian jungle are used for 
the 
landing and takeoff of light planes from the Colombian drug 
"cartels," which pick up cocaine base shipments produced by 
Peruvian drug trafficking gangs.

many things they did. I have, however, said publicly that 
Daniel Ortega was going to face a very difficult situation. 
  If the FSLN does not change -- although he has this 
opportunity and his party gave him this new responsibility -- in 
the long term the FSLN might not survive. If the party changes 
[words indistinct] direction of what the government has been 
doing; that is, that savings are valuable, taxes are paid, 
credits cannot be given away. An economy based on subsidies 
[word indistinct] in Nicaragua or elsewhere in the world. We 
must transfer productive resources from the public sector to the 
private sector and reduce consumption to increase production 
[words indistinct] there are simply no resources to meet all 
that demand. 
  A responsible political leader must tell [passage 
indistinct]. Thus, my opinion is that there is some concern 
because the current that [words indistinct] needed to help 
Nicaragua move forward [passage indistinct] there will be 
contributions to this country if there is a change within the 
FSLN. If it does not change there will be no progress [words 
indistinct] for the good of Nicaragua. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Pereira, in his speech Daniel Ortega called 
for three things: promoting a national movement to win the 1996 
elections, defending revolutionary achievements, and confronting 
the government's neoliberal policies. 
  [Pereira] I think that it is important that there exists in 
this country the political desire to win the upcoming elections 
to [words indistinct] of this country. The great [words 
indistinct] of Nicaraguans is that the fate of this country has 
been in the hands of extremists [words indistinct] if we 
continue to leave the fate of this country in the hands of 
extremists. The church itself, in its recent pastoral letter, 
called on all citizens to participate in politics [words 
indistinct] power fell in the hands of extremes in Somozist and 
Sandinist times [words indistinct]. 
  As for the neoliberal policy [words indistinct] we are 
promoting a market economy. In the modern world, unfortunately, 
the market economy model and the [word indistinct] is the model 
that will create employment in a sustainable manner and will 
reduce poverty [words indistinct] in these modern times would be 
deceitful [passage indistinct]. 
  As for the achievements of the FSLN, I think that [words 
indistinct] among the poor, but for that to happen conditions 
must be created to produce material goods and wealth. Many of 
the great achievements of the Sandinist process [words 
indistinct] based on Socialism. During their 10 years in office 
that government spent more than it received in revenues. When a 
government spends more than it receives, it makes society 
poorer. It is not possible to [words indistinct] of the poor 
when society was made poorer for consecutive years. Only when 
the government spends less than it receives in revenues will it 
be able to [word indistinct] society. 
  Thus, the way to combat any problem [words indistinct] that 
there be austerity and savings, that the size of the public 
sector be reduced, that the productive sector be programmed 
differently, and above all, that there be contributions to the 
attainment of political stability. In this country [words 
indistinct] of those who burn tires and stage uprisings, is to 
deceive the people. 
  I recently read a report on the situation in the rural 
sector related to how the previous administration's economic 
program caused a real disaster, specifically in the condition of 
rural women. I am convinced that this is why they lost the 
elections. 
  The entire population, and mostly women, are aware of the 
unfortunate consequences that could come about when the country 
is continuously subsidized, there is ceaseless paternalism, and 
it is treated like a small child. We recently visited several 
San Carlos communities, and it was quite refreshing to listen to 
the people say that they were not interested in any type of 
subsidies or handouts and that all they really wanted was an 
opportunity to work. This can be accomplished through an 
economic model such as the one we are currently promoting. This 
is the same case throughout most of the rural sector and also as 
it relates to women. These sectors are aware that the practice 
of granting largess and subsidies does not lead [words 
indistinct]. 
  In concluding, I would like to say that I believe that, 
regarding economic policy, the only thing we can learn from the 
previous administration is exactly what we should not do. 
Nevertheless, that does not solve the problems of the most 
needy sectors; you are all aware of this. Regarding FSLN 
economic policies, it is quite clear that there has been no 
encouragement to attract investments, and this is not something 
the government says. This has also been a major Sandinist 
failure. On the social side, there has also been a lot of 
cosmetics. 
  Therefore, looking at things objectively, I believe that 
those of us who are involved in the dialogue are aware that 
there is an opportunity for Daniel Ortega. If he simply starts 
to promote a policy of sustainable growth based on [word 
indistinct], then I believe that he can truly contribute. If he 
changes his practice of promoting violence, aggression, and 
confrontation, then he can definitely contribute. This will 
also be the case if he makes promises based on concrete 
arguments and not vague [words indistinct], then he can most 
definitely contribute. If changes are made in the right 
direction, he can obviously contribute enormously, and the 
Nicaraguan people will be thankful. 
  Now, regarding the elections, my forecast is that they 
definitely stand no chance of winning. The Nicaraguan people 
still remember quite clearly. Obviously the FSLN still has a 
long road to travel mostly to recover its identity, if not its 
unity. However, this does not mean they do not possess an 
identity. Identity entails having a clear economic program on 
what can be done to contribute to the country's development. So 
far, the only thing that has happened is that they have blocked 
this country's development. We still have to see what they can 
do to develop this country.

  [Text] It has been disclosed that Juan Blau, general 
manager of the Interoceanic Region Authority [ARI], could be 
preparing to resign. The likelihood of Mr. Blau's resignation 
has prompted several meetings and concern among the other ARI 
directors. 
  ARI adviser Adolfo Obarrio commented to "Telemetro Reports" 
on the possibility of the resignation of the current ARI general 
manager. 
  [Begin Obarrio recording] All I can say is that we have been 
working normally and have even progressed significantly. I am 
not aware of anything out of the ordinary taking place at this 
time. I am aware, however, of the reports that have been 
circulating through the media. It would seem that there is a 
report that speculates that Mr. Blau could be thinking of 
resigning. Why? I do not know since I have not yet spoken to 
the other ARI directors. Therefore, I am not aware of any 
specific reason that could prompt such a decision. [end 
recording] 
  Mr. Blau's replacement is an issue the ARI Board of 
Directors 
will have to evaluate. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] If Mr. Blau did 
decide to resign, who would replace him? 
  [Obarrio] That is a good question because at this time there 
is no deputy general manager. I am not a lawyer and would not 
like to get involved in an area that is out of my competence. 
Nevertheless, I understand that no government official can 
resign from his post if there is no replacement. I also 
understand that the law requires that a replacement be selected 
from among several candidates. Therefore, Mr. Blau would have to 
remain in his position until the new general manager is 
selected. [end recording]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 May (NA) -- Today, President 
Carlos Menem stated "there is not all that much hurry" to debate 
the pharmaceutical patents law, and he flatly rejected the 
possibility that this would provoke "any type of friction" with 
the U.S. Government, which is demanding quick approval of the 
law. 
  "I have spoken with the ambassador (from the United States 
in 
our country, James Cheek) and he told me there is not that much 
hurry on this topic," Menem said. 
  He also highlighted the fact that "the United States 
understands that the delay in Congress is due to the need to 
achieve a better law." 
  In remarks to the Buenos Aires radio station La 9.90, the 
president again denied that the United States was applying 
pressure to get the pharmaceutical patents law approved.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Clara R.M. do Prado in Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] Brazil and the 12 other countries that make up the 
so-called Rio Group are willing to continue holding talks about 
the Summit of the Americas proposed by the United States. In 
this way, the Rio Group will define issues of common interest, 
and thus achieve a more thorough integration among the countries 
of the American continent. 
  Ambassador Roberto Abdenur, Foreign Ministry secretary 
general, said: "The Latin American answer to this proposal has 
been positive." In Brasilia, Abdenur coordinated the meeting 
between the so-called "troika" faction of the Rio Group 
(comprised of Chile and Ecuador, in addition to Brazil) and the 
representatives of the Argentine and U.S. Governments. There 
are, however, issues on which no agreement has been reached. 
These must be discussed before a consensus on a specific agenda 
and a coordinated plan of action is reached. 
  One of these issues involves trade and the contrary opinions 
held particularly by Brazil and the United States. The U.S. 
Government supports the idea of adding other American countries 
to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) through the 
signature of bilateral agreements. Negotiations with Chile have 
advanced, and talks with other countries, such as Argentina, 
have already started. The Brazilian Government, however, 
believes the agreements must be reached through subregional 
blocs as in the cases of NAFTA, Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South], and the Andean Pact. 
  The Brazilian deputy foreign minister said: "The expansion 
of 
NAFTA has not been mentioned. What has been discussed is a 
gradual process in which the Brazilian side values subregional 
groups, such as Mercosur and Andean Pact, as the basis for a 
gradual deregulation of trade in the region." 
  The U.S. Government's interest in the summit, which was 
officially proposed by the Clinton administration during Vice 
President Al Gore's recent visit to Latin American countries, 
can be measured by the high-ranking level of the U.S. 
representatives who have been sent to the meeting with the Rio 
Group in Brasilia: Lawrence Summers, U.S. Treasury under 
secretary for international affairs; Alexander Watson, assistant 
secretary of state for inter-American affairs; in addition to 
delegates from the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), the trade 
organization that represents the interests of the United States 
and the National Security Council. 
  After the Rio Group meeting, Summers met Central Bank 
President Pedro Malan during the afternoon. On 24 May, he will 
be in Sao Paulo to participate in meetings with entrepreneurs. 
There is also a meeting with Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero 
on his agenda. 
  The Summit of the Americas will continue to be discussed at 
a 
meeting of the Rio Group member countries, which will 
specifically deal with the issue, during the Ibero-American 
conference of presidents and chiefs of state. The meeting will 
be held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14 and 15 June. 
These talks seek consensus on other issues, such as investment, 
which are as important as trade. 
  Abdenur said: "The idea that sustained development can be 
financed by private capital is a good one, but this is a 
volatile and unpredictable source of capital, which could cease 
being available for the long term. The region must therefore 
count on public resources that can be obtained from 
international organizations such as the World Bank and the 
Inter-American Development Bank." He believes these 
multilateral loans must be granted more swiftly and contain 
fewer conditions. He stressed: "It is very important to 
remember that during the talks."

  [Text] Today, 650 Medellin Commune militiamen turned in 
their weapons. A peace treaty was signed a few minutes ago with 
the government following five months of negotiations. 
  The ceremony for the signing of the peace process that 
involves 650 militiamen from three groups in this city is going 
on right now at El Granizal Playground of Medellin's Nororiental 
Commune. There are thousands of people at the playground. They 
are the guarantors that the peace process that begins today 
becomes a reality. The militiamen will turn over their weapons 
as soon as the government minister and the governor of Antioquia 
arrive. They will deliver 150 weapons and at the same time they 
will become part of a process in which they will work for the 
community. 
  [Begin Medellin Mayor Luis Alfredo Ramos recording] The 
national government has the commitment of contributing to the 
continuation of this process, to a permanent presence in the 
process, and to a continuous evaluation of the process to insure 
its continuation. [end recording] 
  The process that concludes in Medellin today is the 
beginning 
of a new one which involves a dialogue with five other militia 
groups in Medellin. 
  Early this morning, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
[FARC] militants who chose not to participate in this process 
protested by carrying out terrorist activities in Medellin. 
Eight urban buses were set on fire in several parts of the 
city, causing losses amounting to 120 million pesos. The urban 
guerrillas have threatened transport owners and have paralyzed 
20 percent of the transportation services to the downtown area. 
The situation returned to normal around 1000. 
  The militiamen who did sign the agreement are optimistic. 
With the agreement, they secured not only guarantees that their 
lives will be respected but also committed the state to making 
social investments in the communes. During the past five months 
of direct conversations with the state, the 650 young Medellin 
militiamen promised to turn over their weapons in exchange for 
social investments. This is what they secured: 
  [Begin reintegrated militia man Felipe recording] The 
creation of the Technological Institute, the [words indistinct], 
the creation of the Carpinelo Health Center. [end recording] 
  In addition to this, the national government must create 
more 
health centers, a human rights office, and family offices, and 
it must improve education centers and control the creeks in the 
Nororiental Commune. During the next two years, the 
reintegrated militiamen will earn 150,000 pesos monthly, will 
receive loans for 3.5 million pesos for mini enterprises, will 
have a two-year insurance policy, and militiamen in prison will 
be pardoned. The church will employ 50 of them in church social 
work. 
  [Begin Father Hector Fabio Henao recording] The militia's 
citizen security work, which includes providing security to some 
neighborhoods, has been acknowledged. They also won something 
else that is very important: They can become a political 
alternative and they also can be a tool for making social 
well-being and investments available to the communities, if they 
remain in the framework of democratic participation and if they 
are able to open communications channels with the communities, 
as is expected. [end recording] 
  But the big and new reward of the militia agreement is that 
it definitely sets in motion the law that created the 
Cooperatives for Community Protection. The young militiamen 
will now use their weapons with the blessing of the state to 
protect their neighborhoods. 
  The Adult Education Center of Santa Cruz Neighborhood will 
be 
the main headquarters of the Cooperatives for Community 
Protection. From this center, 300 young persons will patrol six 
zones of the Nororiental Commune. They will wear a uniform and 
carry a weapon. The people will continue calling them The Boys. 
Starting today, they will show their faces and everybody will 
know their names. 
  [Begin cooperative Director Diego Restrepo recording] Our 
men 
are trained to handle any kind of weapon. Now that we have 
become legal, we have to behave in line with different 
guidelines and must have a change of attitude. We are going to 
work with a different strategy. [end recording] 
  They have taken seven months of human relations and 
community 
work courses. They will take care of the streets of six 
neighborhoods of the Nororiental Commune, the same streets they 
used to protect when they were militiamen. 
  [Begin commune leader Juan Sepulveda recording] The state 
has 
legalized the protection of these neighborhoods by creating a 
protection corps. These young people will be under the control 
of the Private Protection Superintendency. We are going to know 
how many young people there are, in what zones they work, what 
kind of weapons they have, and what kind of identification 
markings they and their vehicles have. [end recording] 
  They will work together with the police. They will support 
each other. The community gave them a location to set up their 
headquarters. Some neighbors still have their doubts. 
  [Begin Luiz Mila Taboada recording] Some people trust what 
they see and what the militia people will do, but other people 
just do not believe and are afraid. [end recording] 
  This will be the country's largest protection cooperative. 
It will be supervised by the townspeople and The Boys trust. 
From now on, they will not have to scrawl the names of their 
dead on the walls of the neighborhoods.

  [Text] "The Cairns Group will continue functioning but with 
goals, and because there are no schedules we must take the 
priorities on the basis of the problems that crop up. But we 
have determined everything that refers to the implementation and 
schedules contained in the final document of the GATT's Uruguay 
Round." This was said by Pedro Saravia, our country's 
livestock, agriculture, and fisheries minister, when he 
evaluated the 14th [Cairns Group meeting], which ended on 20 May 
in Montevideo, as "very positive." 
  It is his opinion that "there are a series of signals 
throughout the world that indicate that the group must continue 
its functions," in addition "it must have the capability of 
answering immediately" because "the first Cairns Group meeting 
took place after the signing of the Marrakech document." 
  Saravia reaffirmed: "The work that was carried out was very 
important as an element of pressure, and it was a way in which 
criteria were unified, thus we can convey to the major powers a 
very different position from the one they already have." But 
the Cairns Group's functioning "is informal and has its 
limitations." 
  The minister considered: "The illegitimacy that world trade, 
meaning subsidies and dumping [preceding word in English], were 
some of the factors on which we have had to work, and in one way 
or another they now are being felt." 
  Undoubtedly these are not the only elements, "but the world 
and the great powers have had to cede some things, including the 
fact that they have had to sit down and discuss new budgets, and 
even though the dismantling will take place within 10 to 15 
years, it can be considered very positive." 
  Saravia stated that even with these ups and downs, the 
Cairns 
Group "countries have played a very important role." 
  The minister, who was the meeting's host, said that during 
the meeting "the code of conduct was not debated, but everything 
pertaining to honesty and loyalty regarding procedures was 
debated." 
  Although it has no legal status and does not have the means 
to act as a referee in controversies that can crop up in the 
trade sector, "the positions that emerged within the group's 14 
member countries are a counterweight when there is a business 
deal with distortions."

  [Text] Chilean Agriculture Under Secretary Alejandro 
Gutierrez said: "Chile is very interested that the Cairns Group 
continue to function because we believe its participation in the 
GATT Uruguay Round was very successful." 
  Now that the GATT Uruguay Round has concluded, the Chileans 
want to see "how it is applied in the rest of the world, and 
this is why the Cairns Group must continue to function as a base 
for the dissemination of information and for action for other 
countries, especially the industrialized countries." 
  The special Chilean mission continues in Uruguay to overcome 
the problems that have occurred with the export of Uruguayan 
meat. These problems pertain to the expiration of the operation 
permits for the meat packing plants and not to problems in the 
quality of the product, as was mentioned originally. 
  In this respect, Gutierrez said that in his country "there 
is 
a new law and this is why the rules and regulations are quite 
strict," and this is also why "the same standard [preceding word 
in English] that is being applied to those who supply us from 
other countries is now being applied to the cattlemen here." 
  It is the view of Chilean authorities that "different rules 
and regulations cannot be applied to the suppliers," and this 
why "the Chilean agricultural mission is now working in Uruguay 
to draft a report." 
  He explained that Chile wants "the typifying rules and 
regulations to be complied with, and that the political 
agreements between the two countries also be observed."

  [Text] Lima, 27 May (EFE) -- In Lima today the Cartagena 
Agreement Board announced that Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela 
have decided to implement the Andean Common External Tariff 
(AEC) as of 31 December 1994. 
  Representatives of the three countries managed to overcome 
disagreements of a conceptual and technical nature and undertook 
serious commitments in this direction during the meeting held by 
the Andean Group Commission, the highest level organ of the 
Andean integration process, during the past four days in this 
capital. 
  The commitment is contained in a decision draft, as the 
integration mandates are called, proposing a tariff structure 
and preferential treatment for Bolivia and Ecuador, as well as 
mechanisms for unifying in time the products that are still 
unable to fully adopt the AEC by 31 December 1994. 
  The project also includes a system for the implementation of 
agreements reached by Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela in the 
automobile sector through a sectorial agreement, and the 
commitment to adopt specific variable rights for agricultural 
products affected by the variations in international prices. 
  It also includes strict mechanisms to restore 
competitiveness 
when one of the member countries is affected by the application 
of tariffs other than the AEC after 31 December 1994, according 
to a press communique issued by the Cartagena Agreement Board. 
  According to the communique, the decision draft implements a 
measure that consolidates the Customs Union [Union Aduanera] and 
establishes clear mechanisms regulating competition between the 
member countries. 
  The Andean Group has established four tariff levels of 5, 
10, 
15, and 20 percent, depending on the merchandise involved. 
  Peru is currently under a special regime within the Andean 
Group, approved in April, that allows it to temporarily regulate 
its trade in the region through bilateral agreements until the 
rest of the member countries gradually eliminate the 
protectionist tariffs they maintain in various economic fields. 
  Peru, according to the mentioned system, continues as an 
observer at the meetings of the commission designed to discuss 
the AEC, and is authorized to maintain tariffs at 15 and 20 
percent.

  [Text] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National 
Civilian Police (PNC), has confirmed he has received death 
threats and that 15 days ago he was the target of an attempt on 
his life. 
  "These actions come from sectors that have yet to understand 
the role of the new society and the democracy being experienced 
in the country," Monterrey told LA PRENSA GRAFICA. Monterrey 
said that for the past 20 days he has been receiving threatening 
phone calls and communiques both at his office and home. He 
added that investigations are being conducted to find out who is 
responsible. 
  The PNC director said that some of the threats have already 
been carried out, indicating that 15 days ago he was the target 
of an attack from which he emerged unharmed. As a result of 
this, he has been forced to take security measures. "I have 
never in my life had to use bodyguards; I have never even been 
armed. Unfortunately, I will have to take some precautions so 
as not to ignore these threats," he added. 
  Monterrey said the PCN has acted firmly against kidnappers, 
drug traffickers, car theft gangs, and individuals who have been 
illegally using weapons, so some of these sectors might be 
responsible for the threats. Monterrey denied that the PNC is 
becoming militarized, and he said the best witness of the 
process is Onusal [UN Observers For El Salvador], whose members 
have participated in the evaluation of the personnel joining the 
PNC. 
  He explained that, up to the PNC's 13th graduation class, 
the 
PNC filled 20 percent of the openings with individuals who had 
been members of the National Police, as was established in the 
Peace Agreements, but that from then on, these individuals have 
not joined the PNC. 
  Nevertheless, the director of the PNC, which was established 
by the Peace Agreements, said that at this 20th recruitment call 
the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] has been 
unable to complete its 20 percent, although it still has time to 
fill it. 
  According to Monterrey, the middle level ranks of the PNC 
are 
filled by persons who have obtained the best scores in their 
evaluations, so now there can be no discrimination. 
  The PNC is carrying out its functions in 12 of the country's 
14 departments, and it is estimated that by the end of October 
it will be doing so throughout the country with 5,700 members. 
  President Alfredo Cristiani has rejected FMLN charges that 
the government is trying to militarize the PNC and proposed the 
creation of a commission to verify this. 
  Cristiani said the government and the FMLN agreed over the 
weekend that the demobilization of the National Police will be 
extended until 31 March 1995, because the PNC is still unable to 
face the increase in crime. 
  He added that they also agreed that an additional number of 
former National Police members, in excess of the 20 percent 
established by the Peace Agreements, can enter the PNC following 
an evaluation and training.

<F P=106> [Report by Alfredo Villareal; from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National 
Civilian Police [PNC], reported that a special PNC brigade 
protects FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] 
leaders to prevent any attack on their personal safety. He also 
disclosed that he may possibly retire at the end of this month. 
  The various threats to well-known FMLN political leaders, 
including attacks in certain cases, such as the Nidia Diaz case, 
has forced the PNC to give 24-hour protection. A special police 
squad has been trained to protect FMLN personalities, Jose Maria 
Monterrey stated. 
  [Begin recording] [Monterrey] We give the so-called top FMLN 
leadership security protection with approximately 400 of our 
people who work in our personality protection division. 
  [Villareal] How is the investigation advancing into the 
death 
of this young bodyguard of a FMLN leader? Where is it headed? 
  [Monterrey] The investigation continues; I believe we will 
soon have results. I cannot say yet because the investigation 
is still incomplete. [end recording] 
  The police chief added that he has tendered an open 
resignation to the new government that will be sworn-in on 1 
July. 
  [Begin recording] [Monterrey] If the president-elect wants 
to, my post will go to someone else. 
  [Villareal] Would you be willing to remain in the post? 
  [Monterrey] Yes, if the president requested me to. 
  [Villareal] But what about you, personally? 
  [Monterrey] I have already made an effort for nearly two 
years, with only one year to go, and would like to make this 
contribution with all the personnel who began this job. [end 
recording] 
  Jose Maria Monterrey, who made his resignation available 
from 
May, met this morning with judges and coroners representatives, 
in order to coordinate protection of these officials when they 
appear on death scenes at night in risky areas.

  [Text] San Salvador, 28 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Salvadoran 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria has said that El 
Salvador cannot receive, even temporarily, Haitian refugees as 
suggested by the United States to all Central American countries. 
  According to an article published today in LA PRENSA 
GRAFICA, 
Salaverria said the United States is presenting this possibility 
not only to Central America, but to the Caribbean and some South 
American countries. 
  The government official explained that the United States has 
made this suggestion in light of the fact that hundreds of 
Haitians are fleeing their country because of the difficult 
political situation. The Haitians are leaving their country in 
boats, many of which are being intercepted at sea. 
  Foreign Minister Salaverria said that the United States is 
looking for a third country that will temporarily accept these 
people while the causes that motivated them to leave their 
country are investigated. If it is found that they fled their 
country for economic reasons, they will be returned to Haiti. 
However, if they fled for political reasons they will be 
allowed to enter the United States. 
  Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani has said that the 
Salvadoran Government has not received an official request from 
the United States, but if it does, "this will have to be 
studied." 
  Salaverria said that El Salvador, a country that is still 
recovering from a 12-year war, saw many of its citizens flee to 
other countries, mainly the United States, Canada, Mexico, and 
Australia. 
  "Our duty is to improve our domestic situation to offer 
favorable conditions for the return of our fellow countrymen," 
the minister said. Salaverria added that the Salvadoran 
attitude does not "reflect a lack of sensitivity on our part, 
but rather it reflects our situation." 
  Meanwhile, Health Minister Gustavo Argueta said that El 
Salvador faces serious problems because it is the smallest 
country in the area and it is overpopulated; therefore, offering 
space to the Haitian refugees "would be illogical."

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 27 May (DPA) -- Today, Constantino 
Matos Villanueva, Dominican Republic Armed Forces secretary, 
ordered that the 5,000 Dominican soldiers on the border be 
replaced to guarantee the effectiveness of the total embargo 
against Haiti. The replacement was made in response to reports 
by international organizations and the U.S. media that Dominican 
soldiers were profiting from the contraband of fuel and other 
Haiti-bound merchandise from Dominican territory. 
  In addition, Matos Villanueva revealed that 30 UN observers 
will come to the country soon to work alongside Dominican troops 
and verify compliance with the embargo. He explained these 
observers, many of whom are soldiers, will work in civilian 
clothes and several of them will man helicopters, speedboats, 
and other logistical equipment that will be used to prevent the 
smuggling of fuel and food. Matos Villanueva said the United 
Nations will supply this U.S.-made equipment. This will be done 
because the Dominican Navy does not have enough ships to patrol 
the Dominican coasts that border Haiti. 
  These measures, Matos Villanueva added, were suggested by 
Alexander Martinovic, political official of the UN Security 
Council Sanction Committee, who visited the Dominican Republic 
early this week at the head of an observers mission. 
  Meanwhile, Matos Villanueva concluded that the border has 
remained sealed off for the past three days and the movement of 
persons or vehicles between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is 
not allowed.

  [Text] United Nations, 27 May (EFE) -- Today, Pedro 
Blandino Canto, Dominican ambassador to the United Nations, said 
his government is taking action to comply with the embargo along 
the border with Haiti. He added that embargo violations 
registered were minor and that an effort is being made to 
prevent them. 
  During a news conference, Blandino Canto accused U.S. 
television media of staging a campaign accusing his country of 
violating the embargo; however, up until now they have only 
presented images of civilians "who are taking advantage of the 
situation by transporting jugs of fuel through isolated areas." 
  According to the Dominican ambassador, "no one has been able 
to display photographs of private, military, or petroleum 
company fuel trucks transporting gasoline to Haiti." He added 
that, since the beginning of the Haitian crisis, the Dominican 
Republic's policy has been "coherent, stable, and humanitarian." 
  As he had done previously, before Latin American and 
Caribbean countries, the ambassador mentioned the measures 
adopted by his government to assure the fulfillment of the 
embargo. These measures started with the creation of a 
high-level commission, comprised of the military chiefs. This 
commission requested technical assistance from the United 
Nations. 
  Blandino Canto added that he had met on two occasions with 
Nigerian Ambassador Ibrahim Gambari, president of the UN 
Security Council, to analyze the matters and with UN 
undersecretary Marrack Goulding, to discuss the technical 
mission. 
  The diplomat distributed copies of the 13 April decree 
issued 
by Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer, whereby the commission 
was created. The commission, chaired by Armed Forces State 
Secretary, was authorized, at the request of the United Nations 
and the corresponding organizations, "exclusive logistic and 
technical support, in case it was considered necessary." 
  He also delivered a copy of the letter whereby the 
Commission 
requests UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, to send a technical 
mission "to study on site the true situation that prevails," and 
to present recommendations on the case. 
  The Dominican organization promises "the most faithful 
fulfillment of these recommendations "to prevent weapons, 
petroleum, petroleum by-products, and other articles that are 
not strictly humanitarian from being introduced through the land 
border and the adjacent marine areas. 
  The Dominican Republic, in addition to supplying the 
logistical support that may be considered necessary, will 
"gladly" receive the technical advisers that the UN secretary 
general may appoint. This was stated in the Dominican 
commission's letter to Butrus-Ghali. 
  Ambassador Blandino Canto also made reference to the 
elections in his country, which were held on the 16th, signaling 
that they are not directly related to the Haitian problem. The 
exception is the campaign staged against his country, based on 
"the irresponsible allegations by an alleged observer," clearly 
making reference to former U.S. Congressman Stephen Solarz. 
  The Dominican diplomat acknowledged that during the 
elections 
"irregularities could have been registered, as happens in all 
elections, but that this does not constitute fraud, unless the 
results are altered." He also recalled that, according to the 
last Electoral Board bulletin, President Balaguer was reelected 
with more than a 30,000-vote advantage over the candidate who 
came in second.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 30 May (EFE) -- Today, Dominican 
Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral advocated that 
Haitians be allowed to cross the border to buy food to satisfy 
their basic needs. Herrera Cabral said the ban on the entry of 
Haitians to buy food "is excessive" and they should be allowed 
to buy food. He added that "Haiti cannot be turned into a 
prison or an immense concentration camp," seeking to justify his 
position of allowing Haitians to enter to buy food. 
  Since last Friday, Dominican troops have been preventing 
Dominicans and Haitians from crossing the border to buy or sell 
products. Up to last Friday, Haitians had been allowed to enter 
for several hours on Mondays and Fridays to sell their products. 
They took advantage of the opportunity to buy dry goods which 
are scarce in Haiti. 
  Increased border vigilance began after Dominican President 
Joaquin Balaguer committed with UN negotiator Dante Caputo and 
William Gray, U.S. Government delegate, to completely close the 
border with Haiti. 
  Regarding UN observers who will arrive in the Dominican 
Republic to supervise fulfillment of the embargo, he explained 
they will not bring military equipment or troops. Herrera 
Cabral said: "Military equipment is not needed to control a 
disarmed and hungry people." Herrera Cabral added that the UN 
observers are coming with logistical equipment to support the 
border surveillance by Dominican military. 
  Miguel Bermeo Estrella, UN delegate in Santo Domingo, told 
EFE that the observer mission will arrive in Santo Domingo after 
UN Secretary General Butros-Ghali studies the report prepared by 
the mission that assessed the situation two weeks ago at the 
border of the Caribbean island. Bermeo Estrella said the 
sending of the mission observers will depend on Butros-Ghali's 
decision. 
  As for the scope of the total embargo, Bermeo Estrella 
explained that "humanitarian aid" programs are being conducted 
to prevent poverty and hunger from further destroying the 
Haitian people.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 27 May (AFP) -- Armed Forces 
spokesmen report that 19 people have died and 42 others have 
been injured along the Dominican-Haitian border since the 
embargo on Haiti began to be intensified on Saturday. Citing 
military sources, local newspapers reported today that 
fatalities and injuries along the border have been caused by 
accidents involving vehicles that were smuggling fuel into Haiti 
and that were attempting to evade pusuing military vehicles. 
Over the weekend, the Dominican Army intensified its 
surveillance of more than 300 km of border with Haiti to prevent 
the smuggling of fuel into the neighboring country.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 27 May (AFP) -- Today, Dominican 
Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera said deposed President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide should resign to facilitate a negotiated 
solution to the Haitian crisis. Herrera said he does not 
believe that stepping up the embargo or resorting to military 
intervention to force Aristide's return are solutions for the 
neighboring country. 
  "I believe the solution will be for the military to leave 
power and for Aristide to resign, thereby making way for a 
provisional government and, in turn, general elections," Herrera 
said in a domestic television interview. According to Herrera, 
if the Haitian military is crushed by way of a military 
intervention, then Aristide would have to rule with a government 
guarded by foreign troops. 
  The Dominican deputy foreign minister, who is considered an 
expert on Haiti, reiterated his disagreement with the embargo 
because Haiti "has become a huge concentration camp." Herrera 
also said that it was "impossible" for the Dominican Republic to 
prevent contraband fuel from trickling into Haiti "because we 
have 300 km of border which is very difficult to patrol." 
  Herrera also rejected the idea presented by Western powers 
that Haitian refugee camps be set up in Dominican Republic. 
This topic, as well as the issue of border patrols, was 
discussed with President Joaquin Balaguer by President Bill 
Clinton's special envoy William Grey on Wednesday night in Santo 
Domingo. Following the meeting, Balaguer announced that he 
"would seal" the border. 
  According to information received today, Balaguer met 
yesterday afternoon with the Armed Forces High Command to 
instruct them to redouble border vigilance. According to Army 
sources, more than 10,000 soldiers are deployed in the 
impoverished border region to prevent contraband and Haitians 
crossing into the Dominican Republic. 
  Armed Forces Secretary General Constantino Matos told the 
press that "we are conducting strenuous and honest work" along 
the border in an effort to comply with UN decisions. 
Nevertheless, he admitted, "it is possible that some gasoline 
is still being shipped" into Haiti, but "not with the consent of 
the Armed Forces." Matos also announced that border troops will 
soon be relieved by fresh troops, and he gave assurances that if 
officers or soldiers are found to have permitted contraband to 
cross the border into Haiti, they will be severely punished. 
  [In a related 210-word, Santo Domingo-dateline report, Paris 
AFP in Spanish at 1335 GMT on 27 May notes, "The presence of 
Haitians in the commercial sector of downtown Santo Domingo, 
where they secure supplies to meet demands for various goods in 
their country, has been reduced to a minimum." The report adds: 
"A similar drop in the presence of Haitians was noticed in the 
border province of Pedernales, 350 km south of Santo Domingo. 
According to reports from the border region, many Haitians are 
gathering along a small river on the border, waiting to 
establish contact with Dominicans wanting to sell them food."]

<F P=106> [By Arturo Gudino] </F>
  [Text] Santo Domingo, 27 May (AFP) -- Opposition 
presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez today announced 
that should the Central Electoral Board (JCE) proclaim President 
Joaquin Balaguer the winner, the elected mayors, deputies, and 
senators of his party will not take office. This, in all light, 
would provoke an institutional crisis that would prevent 
Balaguer, should he be proclaimed winner, from ruling the 
country beginning on 16 August, date scheduled for the change of 
government. 
  After the 16 May general elections, Pena Gomez made 
accusations of a massive fraud in favor of Balaguer, who is 
seeking reelection to a seventh term. According to Pena Gomez, 
the JCE Computer Center and at least two of its five magistrates 
planned the fraud through a computer maneuver that left about 
200,000 citizens, who could not vote and were replaced by others 
"who voted twice," off from the voting list 
  In statements to the media, Pena Gomez said that if Balaguer 
is proclaimed the winner before clarifying the serious 
irregularities that were denounced, his deputies, senators, and 
mayors will not take office. With only eight voting tables 
pending count, Balaguer was ahead of Pena Gomez, but by only 1 
percent of the votes, that is, about 30,000. Should this trend 
be repeated in the vote count for deputies, senators, and 
mayors, where the PRD [Dominican Revolutionary Party] could win 
a majority, Balaguer might be unable to rule, because the 
congressional chambers would not be operational. 
  "No winner has been proclaimed and cannot be proclaimed, but 
if they try to do so, they should know that there would be an 
illegitimate government in place, which we will combat by all 
means," Pena Gomez said. "We will not legalize any usurper," 
added the black Social Democratic leader in a vigorous tone. 
  Pena Gomez has so far prevented street demonstrations by his 
followers, in an effort to avoid any violence, and has shown 
impartiality, an image that contrasts with the one that the 
official party tried to sell during the electoral campaign. 
  Pena Gomez said that in the past hours, he has received 
solidarity calls from Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, 
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, and Portuguese 
President Mario Soares. He added that he will send missions to 
Europe and America to show that his charges are based on 
reality. Meanwhile, various sectors of Dominican society 
started to demand a solution to the crisis through an agreement 
between the various political forces and President Balaguer.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 29 May (AFP) -- The social democratic 
Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) of presidential candidate 
Jose Francisco Pena Gomez today denounced "an attempt to stage 
an electoral coup" that would jeopardize "the nation's 
democratic order." 
  In a communique issued in Santo Domingo, the PRD and the 
other seven small parties that supported Pena Gomez stated that 
"we are facing an electoral coup attempt perpetrated by the 
current government (of conservative President Joaquin Balaguer) 
through the distortion of the electoral process. The Dominican 
Republic held presidential, parliamentary, and municipal 
elections on 16 May in the presence of international observers. 
  "Government officials, in an attempt to keep themselves in 
power, realizing that it is impossible for them to win the 
elections honestly, decided to corrupt the electoral process, 
because they know that it is difficult for them to achieve their 
goal through a direct coup d'etat or through military force, the 
communique stated. 
  After insisting that Balaguer's Social Christian Reformist 
Party (PRSC) has resorted to "fraudulent attempts in the past," 
the PRD maintained that "on this occasion, the crisis acquired 
an unprecedented characteristic because the country's democratic 
order is at stake." 
  The PRD and seven other parties said "the key is to preserve 
the representative system," and reaffirmed that [words 
indistinct] the PRD leaders announced last Friday, in the voice 
of Pena Gomez himself. Analysts think this could reportedly 
unleash an institutional crisis that would prevent Balaguer, 
should he be proclaimed winner, from ruling beginning on 16 
August, the date scheduled for the change in government. 
  Balaguer, an octogenarian who is virtually blind and has a 1 
percent (30,000 vote) lead in the vote count, plans to start his 
seventh term in the presidency in the next four days. 
  No winner in the presidential elections has yet been 
proclaimed because of the fraud charges, and the Central 
Electoral Board announced that it will start an investigation 
into alleged distortions in the voters list. Meanwhile, Pena 
Gomez announced he will start an international offensive to 
prove that his fraud charges are true.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 27 May (EFE) -- The feared "Tontons 
Macoutes" reappeared in Haiti today and announced their 
intention to assist the Army in preventing a foreign military 
intervention. 
  Spokesman Gerard Dessaint said "reinforced vigilance" 
throughout the country is the new assignment of this 
paramilitary group, which is accused of killing thousands of 
people under the Duvalier regimes. 
  Dessaint said the group is ready, together with the Haitian 
Army, to combat a possible foreign military intervention. He 
said the group intends to once again establish its garrisons 
throughout the country and keep close watch over all Haitian 
territory. 
  According to Dessaint, within 15 days the "Tontons Macoutes" 
will be seen all across Haiti wearing their traditional blue 
uniform. 
  The "Tontons Macoutes," the name given to the paramilitary 
police created by dictator Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier in the 
1950's, was officially dissolved in February 1986, following the 
overthrow of his son's regime. Later, many of its members 
joined the Army and have served as volunteers in the police and 
Armed Forces. Most of them, however, became "attaches," who are 
used in attacks on citizens, especially followers of President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in September 1991 by the 
military under the command of Raoul Cedras. 
  The announcement of the reappearance of the "Tontons 
Macoute" 
takes place at a time when the United Nations is trying to 
enforce a total embargo against Haiti to force the military to 
abandon power. 
  A U.S. aircraft carrier, a helicopter carrier, and two 
special patrol boats, along with other vessels, are maneuvering 
near Haiti to reinforce the naval embargo against this Caribbean 
country. 
  In the neighboring Dominican Republic, the border has been 
militarized by the Dominican Government to avoid the smuggling 
of gasoline and other oil derivative fuels. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1737 GMT on 27 May transmits a 
similar 350-word report that quotes Dessaint saying that "more 
than 30,000 VSN (National Security Volunteers, better known as 
the `Tontons Macoutes') have already been recruited from around 
Port-au- Prince."]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rothschild Francois] </F>
  [Text] [Francois] On 27 May, the Tontons Macoutes formally 
announced that the Volunteers for National Security [Volontaires 
de la Securite Nationale (VSN)] have returned to the Haitian 
political scene, eight years after being dissolved by Henry 
Namphy and the Government National Council. They noted that the 
move was prompted by the threat of intervention hanging over 
Haiti. 
  Mrs. (Gerard Dessain), the VSN's new leader, explains that 
the Tontons Macoutes have offered to help the Haitian Army fight 
foreign troops in case of invasion. (Dessain) asserts that the 
big Duvalierist lords or the big Tontons Macoutes lords are 
behind this movement: 
  [Begin (Dessain) recording, in Creole] All VSN delegates 
from 
the nine departments that were sent here today say: No! No! 
They will not accept an intervention. There will be an 
intervention only over our dead bodies. We will be in front and 
the Army will be behind. We offer our services to the Army 
because we are not ungrateful. The Army trained us. We only 
know how to use weapons because the Army taught us how to fight. 
The Army taught us how to protect ourselves. We cannot betray 
the Army. They think that the Army is alone today, but this is 
not true. Some people have a conscience. Some people love 
their country and side with the Army. We, the VSN, say we are 
present. We make it a point of saying that we are on the field. 
We stand beside the Army in defending our country no matter 
when, no matter which day they wish to intervene. We know they 
can kill us, but we will not die on our knees. We will not die 
sitting down. We will not be disabled. We will die standing 
up. [applause] [end recording] 
  [Francois] (Dessain), who was addressing correspondents at 
the downtown headquarters of the neo-Duvalierist party known as 
the Assembly of Democrats for the Republic, rose up against 
military intervention in Haiti. (Dessain) also tried to make it 
clear that Port-au-Prince slums would be destroyed by the 
foreign forces in case of intervention. (Dessain) noted that 
30,051 Tontons Macoutes have already been recruited in the 
metropolitan area alone. She asked President-in-Exile 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to take an official stand against 
military intervention in Haiti to solve the crisis. (Dessain), 
who leads the VSN, also asserted that the Tontons Macoutes and 
the VSN will be donning their blue uniforms nationwide very soon.

  [Text] Port au Prince, 30 May (EFE) -- Today, Haitian 
Information Minister Jacques Saint-Louis said the de facto 
government of Emile Jonassaint will not accept the return of the 
paramilitary group known as Tonton Macoutes, which was created 
during the years of the Duvalier dynasty. 
  In an interview on Radio Metropole, Saint-Louis said the 
Jonassaint government will not permit the return of the group 
which was dissolved in 1986. He recalled that the Haitian 
Constitution authorizes only the Army and the police as armed 
corps. Saint-Louis urged the people to remain alert in case of 
a foreign invasion, however. 
  Franck Pierre, of the Capois La Mort organization (on Army 
salary), asked General Raoul Cedras, commander of the Haitian 
Armed Forces, to decree a general mobilization to face the 
foreign threat. Pierre also asked Cedras to reintegrate retired 
officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces to form a "Grand 
Military Council" and put the country on a war footing. 
  The leader of the extreme right organization urged Cedras to 
request Parliament and the president de facto to declare a state 
of siege in the country. 
  Meanwhile, the announcement about the resurging of the 
Tonton 
Macoutes continues sparking reactions from political leaders. 
Reynold Georges, of the (center-right) Alliance for the 
Liberation of Haiti, said the announcement is "a violation of 
and an injury to" the Constitution. 
  Eddy Volel, of the (center-left) Reunion of Christian 
Democrats, said that with this maneuver, the military will 
provoke a civil war in the country.

  [Excerpt] Deputy Antoine Joseph, member of the Movement To 
Establish Democracy in Haiti and former lower chamber president, 
has asserted that the Jonassaint government is illegal and 
unconstitutional and that he does not recognize the current 
power's authority. Deputy Joseph believes the government that 
was installed by a group of legislators and not by the entire 
legislative corps operates beyond the constitutional provisions 
provided for in that respect. Deputy Joseph, who noted friction 
between the executive, the parliament, and the position of the 
political parties, considers that all the conditions have been 
met to overthrow the Jonassaint government. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Lester Bird at the Organization </F>
of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) meeting in St. Lucia on 26 
May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Chief Minister of Montserrat, Prime Minister Compton 
of St. Lucia, fellow ministers, members of our diplomatic corps, 
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: I wish to thank the 
chief minister of Montserrat and the prime minister of St. Lucia 
for the warm words expressed by both of you on my election to 
the prime ministership of Antigua and Barbuda. 
  As many of you are aware, I have been attending conferences 
of heads of government of the OECS [Organization of Eastern 
Caribbean States] from its inception. Indeed, you accorded me 
the distinct honor of allowing me to be its first chairman even 
though I was not a prime minister. In that sense, I spent the 
last 14 years in this council impersonating a head of 
government. And many of you spent the last 14 years in 
complicity. I am pleased that by electing to government the 
party which I have the honor to lead, the people of Antigua and 
Barbuda have chosen to relieve not only me of the role of 
impersonator but you of the burden of collusion. 
  On a serious note, I place on record my profound thanks to 
OECS heads of government past and present, who over the last 14 
years, have treated me with such great consideration. Mr. 
Chairman, it is fitting for me that the first OECS heads of 
government conference I should attend as prime minister is held 
in St. Lucia. For on this island and under your wise and mature 
guidance, Mr. Chairman, our countries have together made many 
practical decisions which have advanced the economic and 
political interests of our subregion. Therefore, while coming to 
St. Lucia for the first time as prime minister is for me a 
beginning, it is also a continuum for the beginning benefits 
from a solid foundation of experience gained in the council. 
  Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, more than anyone else I 
am conscious that in recent years Antigua and Barbuda appears to 
have stepped back from the regional movement. We appear to be 
standing apart, indifferent of the faith and fortunes of our 
regional kith and kin. This is not so. In this case, 
appearance belies reality. The vast majority of the people of 
Antigua and Barbuda continue to regard the Commonwealth 
Caribbean and the OECS, especially, as an extension of 
themselves. They are keenly aware that ultimately their 
authenticity as a culture group, their survival as an economic 
entity, and their political legitimacy in a world which 
increasingly marginalizes small and powerless states lies in 
concerted economic and political action with the Caribbean 
family and more particularly their West Indian brothers and 
sisters. 
  Over the last few years, Antigua and Barbuda has been 
preoccupied with its internal political affairs. Our 
preoccupation flowed from the fact that after more than 50 years 
in which he dominated political life in our country, Vere 
Cornwall Bird, Sr. was departing the national stage. 
  As you are aware, any change creates insecurity and 
uncertainty. When the change in power replaces a leader who over 
five decades symbolized dependability and safety to the nation, 
even greater apprehension arises. In such a milieu, as people 
search for something to fill the void, opportunities are created 
for the untried and the untested in whose hands neither Antigua 
and Barbuda's affairs nor the influence of such affairs upon 
neighboring territories could be certain. 
  Mr. Chairman, it is as well that in Antigua and Barbuda we 
took the time to settle our internal affairs for we have emerged 
from it a stronger and more stable democracy. While the 
campaigning was intense, our elections were conducted without 
violence or loss of life. The decision of the people was 
accepted peacefully by our two political parties, both of which 
are represented in parliament. We have now set to the task of 
governance through established democratic institutions, 
including a virulent if sometimes unnecessarily vicious, 
unfettered opposition press, enhancing, as it does, the space 
for free political expression and action. Such a democracy is 
good for the maintenance of stability in Antigua and Barbuda. 
It can only be beneficial to the security of the region as a 
whole and, particularly, to the member-states of this 
organization. 
  Mr. Chairman, our preoccupation with our internal political 
affairs led only to a lowering of regional concern on our 
national agenda, not to its removal. That decisive period in 
our nation's history is now behind us and we can again lift our 
eyes above the plane of national full contributions to the 
strengthening of our institutions. [sentence as heard] 
  We will play our part on the international stage to augment 
the bargaining strength of the OECS against third countries and 
groups of countries. 
  As we survey the global landscape, it appears beset with 
difficulties for our small island-states. An objective analysis 
paints a worryisome picture. The Caricom [Caribbean Common 
Market] area faces higher prices for goods and services imported 
from North America and Europe. Dwindling aid, increasing 
international rivalry for private capital, both loans and 
investments, is reducing shares of our two principal markets in 
Europe and North America and intensifying competition for 
tourism. It is becoming increasingly clear that the 
preferential market which our countries and others in the 
Caribbean community have enjoyed in the EC will, in fact, 
disappear. Already, trade preferences have increased, the share 
of Central American exports to the EC to approximately the same 
level as Caribbean exports. And recent developments arising 
from the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade signal that bananas and sugar from the so-called (?dollar) 
countries, particularly Central America and Spanish-speaking 
Caribbean states, will enjoy an even bigger share of the EC 
market. Banana growers in our part of the Caribbean will not be 
competing on a level playing field. The absence of strict labor 
laws and, therefore, poor wages paid to Central American 
workers, combined with the resources of the U.S. companies which 
own many plantations and market the bananas, place eastern 
Caribbean countries at a severe disadvantage. 
  I need hardly tell this audience that any significant loss 
of 
the banana market in the EC by the Windward Islands will have a 
most distressing effect on the foreign exchange earnings of the 
eastern Caribbean dollar (?area) and on our (?reserves). In 
turn, this will adversely affect our ability to pay for the 
import of goods and services. The combined effect of less 
foreign exchange and a contraction of the import sector would 
lead to a consequential reduction in public sector programs and 
to unemployment. In short, economic decline could stare us in 
the face. 
  NAFTA offers no more promising an outlook for trade. 
Mexico's involvement in the free trade area with the United 
States and Canada threatens to adversely effect Caribbean 
exports to the U.S. and Canada, especially the assembly 
industry, textiles, and the apparel industry. The limited 
access provided to the U.S. market by the Caribbean Basin 
Initiative [CBI] and to Canada by the Caricom agreement pales 
into insignificance when compared with the access Mexico will 
enjoy on the NAFTA. When Mexico's comparatively lower labor 
costs and its proximity to the U.S. market is factored into the 
equation, the Caribbean will obviously lose market share. By 
the same token, hurrying into NAFTA as it stands is not 
desirable in our opinion. Free trade groups from NAFTA would 
cripple, if not kill, many of our industrial enterprises, whose 
production could not match their cheaper prices. 
  In this connection, we must renew our efforts to seek parity 
with Mexico for Caribbean goods that now enter the U.S. market 
under the CBI while we negotiate ways to enter NAFTA with agreed 
mechanisms to relieve the effects of reciprocal free trade with 
three giants such as the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. 
  Mr. Chairman, we, together with other Caribbean Basin 
countries, are not without some collective bargaining strength 
in relation to NAFTA. CBI beneficiary countries have increased 
their spending in the United States. Purchases of U.S. goods 
and services grew from $340 million in 1986 to $11 billion in 
1992, providing for 200,000 direct jobs and 1 million indirect 
jobs in the United States. And with many of our countries, the 
U.S. enjoys a balance of trade surplus. But we, in the OECS and 
the wider Caricom, have to forge strategic coalitions or 
alliances with other countries or groups of countries to promote 
our interests. In this context, an alliance with other 
Caribbean Basin countries is imperative. For without such an 
alliance, large groupings such as NAFTA and the EC, faced with 
contending interests from Central American countries, on the one 
hand, and Caricom countries, on the other, may find it very 
difficult to be evenhanded in their treatment. We may well be 
the losers. 
  Further, to the extent that Caricom countries could agree a 
joint position with Central American countries and the Dominican 
Republic for negotiations with NAFTA and the EC, to that extent 
we can expect no collective bargaining position. The decision 
by Caricom heads of government to adopt the recommendation of 
the West Indian commission and create an association of 
Caribbean states is extremely important. However, we should 
guard against the possibility of such an association 
unintentionally becoming the servant of its most powerful 
masters and accidentally neglecting the interests of its smaller 
and weaker members, which is what Caricom states would be. It 
is essential that the association reflects the consensus and 
interests of its membership and that it be dominated by no one 
country or group of countries, that it mediate contending views 
between different groups, and that it construct a relationship 
among its members that serves the community of interests. 
  In this regard, Mr. Chairman, I repeat a position which I 
(?enunciated) last month in Basse-Terre, when in the presence of 
our colleague, the prime of St. Kitts, I spoke at the 12th 
annual banquet of the St. Kitts and Nevis private sector. I 
said then...[pauses] And I strongly favor the location of the 
headquarters of the association of Caribbean states in Jamaica, 
which sits almost geographically between the English- and 
Spanish-speaking Caribbean Basin countries. After all, it was to 
Jamaica that the great father of Latin American liberation, 
Simon Bolivar, retreated after his earlier failure to liberate 
Venezuela from Spanish domination. It was from there that he 
issued his famous Jamaica Letter, which set a successful plan 
for the independence of so many Latin American states, including 
Bolivia, named after him. 
  Both historically and geographically, Jamaica lends itself 
as 
a hospitable location for the headquarters of the association. 
I hope that in this meeting, we, in the OECS, would endorse 
this suggestion, that Jamaica should be the location of the 
headquarters and that we could jointly advance the idea in the 
councils of Caricom and the wider Caribbean Basin area. 
  Another element in our approach to the issue of NAFTA should 
be the special relationship that Caricom countries have always 
enjoyed with Canada. As the West Indian commission pointed out 
in its report, and I quote, together, we are the Commonwealth 
countries of the hemisphere; that shared history has forged 
strong ties over the years and provides a natural bond; there is 
every reason why we should seek to engage the Canadian 
Government at the highest level in working out our arrangements. 
  To me, to Antigua and Barbuda, it is a significant 
indication 
of Canada's continuing goodwill to the Caribbean that last month 
the Canadian International Development Agency agreed to finance 
a Caricom study on the likely effects of NAFTA and the strategy 
options for the community. A Canada-Caricom-heads-of-government 
conference would be beneficial to this process at this time. 
Perhaps we in the OECS can take the initiative in trying to 
structure such a meeting at the earliest opportunity. 
  What about the United States, itself? We have to be 
cognizant of how Washington works. It is a city of lobbying, 
whether we like it or not. We will get little movement beyond 
what the U.S. Government thinks it can sell to Congress unless 
we help to accelerate that movement ourselves. And to do so, we 
have to mount a lobby in Washington that includes but does not 
rely solely on our embassies there. Contact has to be made with 
every congressman and senator. That could make a difference to 
how we are treated in NAFTA. We have to inform them, educate 
them, and win them over, if not all, the majority. Jamaica has 
had lobbyists in Washington for some time. The Cheddi Jagan 
government, in Guyana, has had lobbyists since it won the 
election in 1992. And, significantly, Trinidad and Tobago has 
announced that it too has employed a firm of lobbyists. We, in 
the OECS countries, should do no less if we expect to be heard 
by the ears of Washington. 
  With regard to the EC, Mr. Chairman, in the past, we tended 
to focus our efforts in Britain, neglecting the reality that 
many powers over trade and policy have passed to the EC and its 
executive agency, the European Commission, in Brussels. Lastly, 
there has been an attempt to strengthen our presence in 
Brussels, but it needs to be more permanent and in greater 
numbers. Our collective voting and lobbying strength is 
important. But to be able to utilize such voting and lobbying 
strength in Brussels, we require a prominent presence, working 
in a coordinated way. 
  I know that we have all agreed to have Mr. (Larocque) 
represent us. I would like, however, in the course of this 
meeting to suggest that we have to deal with the question of our 
voting rights, as to whether or not we will vote as one or we 
will vote with the full impact of our several votes. 
Increasingly, too, lobbying efforts have become as important in 
Brussels as the European Commission evolves into a labyrinth of 
discreet decisionmaking departments. It may serve the OECS well 
to consider retaining well-placed lobbying experts and, on a 
joint basis, to supplement the work of closely coordinated 
missions. 
  Mr. Chairman, as we survey our regional scene, it is 
striking 
that Haiti stands out as the country in dire need of attention. 
Its attempt to establish a democratic system of government 
after two centuries was aborted by a military coup, supported by 
a financial elite opposed to economic and political reform. As 
countries committed to democracy, free and fair elections, and 
the unfettered expression of the will of the people, it is 
axiomatic that we find government and military force 
reprehensible. The weekly slaughter of hundreds of Haitians by 
agents of the military regime and the suffering of the vast 
majority of the dispossessed in this society are matters which 
cause us, as Caribbean people, even greater concern. That there 
is need for action to remedy the Haitian situation is beyond 
question. However, as small Caribbean states, we should view 
with some apprehension any suggestion of military intervention 
unless such intervention were under the auspices of the United 
Nations and with the authority of the Security Council. As it 
stands, I would advised the established principle justifying 
(?new) intervention under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter a threat 
to peace does not appear at this moment to apply in the case, 
which creates a difficulty for us. [sentence as heard] 
  Mr. Chairman, the weekly reports of (?massive) rapes and 
mutilations and the continuous reports now that the current 
voluntary embargo is causing the suffering only for the poor, 
while the Army and its rich financial backers continue to enjoy 
a good life. Good conscience demands that to use our concerted 
efforts to call for a realistic remedy to this situation by the 
United Nations. 
  I hope at this meeting we can agree to make such a call and 
advance it in Caricom, the OAS, and the United Nations for the 
benefit of the Haitian people. It only remains for me to say, 
Mr. Chairman, on behalf of those of us who are privileged to be 
guests in St. Lucia, what a great pleasure it is to be here. 
St. Lucians are reputed to be generous by nature and charming 
by inclination. I have no doubt that before this visit has 
ended, many here will have found reason to support my testimony. 
In advance and in anticipation, Mr. Chairman, I thank you, the 
Government and the people of St. Lucia, for the hospitable 
environment which we all know we will enjoy. Thank you, very 
much for being patient with me. [applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with Hocine Ait-Ahmed, leader of the Algerian </F>
Socialist Forces Front, by Qasiyy Salih al-Darwish "somewhere in 
Switzerland"; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Darwish] Hocine Ait-Ahmed, a few days ago 
you called for a serious and comprehensive dialogue. It was not 
your first appeal. Do you believe developing conditions can 
still make a solution based on dialogue a success? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] I believe in Algeria. I do not believe in the 
inevitability of a national collapse. We have over the past two 
years been calling for holding a sovereign national conference. 
  [Al-Darwish] Is that what you call a constituent assembly? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] No...a sovereign national conference with the 
powers to set up institutions and structures for the 
transitional phase. This conference should comprise the regime, 
that is the Army, and the political formations representing 
Algerian society. 
  [Al-Darwish] Including the [Islamic] Salvation Front [FIS]? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Of course including the FIS. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Darwish] Am I to understand that you believe the 
security option has failed completely? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Completely. I have from the outset said that 
this option is doomed to failure. I spoke openly about this 
with Major General Khaled Nezzar following the assassination of 
President Boudiaf. We stressed the need to open a direct 
dialogue with all parties. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Darwish] But are you calling for dialogue with the FIS 
or with the armed organizations? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Of course with the FIS. However, we believe 
that the FIS' commitment to and entry into the dialogue process 
is bound to influence these organizations. But nothing prevents 
us from addressing these organizations and their members as 
Algerians who have adopted a means of expression of which we do 
not approve and which we reject in the political action domain 
for the sake of sparing the blood of Algerian men and women. 
  [Al-Darwish] Did you follow the reports of contacts between 
the regime and FIS leaders? Did these contacts include you? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Of course, we followed these reports with 
interest, through the press, rumors, and private channels as 
well. But we were not consulted, nor did anyone contact us. 
Nevertheless, we bless these initiatives and hope they are 
serious. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Darwish] What about the message you sent to President 
Zeroual on 9 April? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Proceeding from my personal and partisan 
responsibility, I wanted to renew our call for dialogue and to 
express to the new president our fear of moving toward a worse 
security situation, especially after the emergence of serious 
maneuvers and calls in recent weeks. 
  [Al-Darwish] I believe that you are referring to the calls 
for distributing arms and forming militias. Do you believe that 
the regime has something to do with these calls? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] The call by some ministers from Redha Malek's 
government for calling up the reserve and civil defense elements 
is nothing but a framework for what is called in other cases 
"militias." In the Algerian political reality it means moving a 
step closer to all-out civil war. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Algeria is prepared to enter into partnership with 
any foreign bank that wishes to work in Algeria, on the basis of 
competition in the banking system which will come into force 
soon. This was stated by Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour in a 
televised interview on the recent agreement between Algeria and 
the IMF. The minister said that Algerian banking, as a vital 
element in the stage of economic stability, is now subject to 
restructuring much the same as other institutions.

<F P=106> [Commentary by unidentified JANA editor] </F>
  [Text] In a statement, the Rwandan National Front 
criticized France's interference in Rwanda. The Front stressed 
that France had been involved in this conflict for three years 
through giving weapons to some parties in the conflict and this 
added to the massacres among the ranks of the Rwandan people. 
The UN secretary general called for preparing a huge UN military 
force to send to Rwanda, which is witnessing a party and tribal 
conflict. 
  The JANA African affairs editor commented on this by saying: 
Western states are the ones that fabricate incidents and 
problems in many parts of the world with the aim of achieving a 
military intervention in those regions. 
  The editor wondered why international forces did not stop 
the 
racial and religious conflict in Bosnia and said that the 
dubious role of these forces in Somalia was known to all.

  [Text] The U.S. House of Representatives has decided to 
seize the Iraqi assets which have been frozen in the United 
States since the Gulf war, valued at $1.2 billion. The JANA 
economic affairs editor commented on this, saying: 
  The decision of the U.S. House of Representatives to seize 
Iraqi assets deposited in American banks was a clear and direct 
robbery which is punishable by the international law that 
organizes relations between states. It is also considered as an 
open violation and blatant aggression against all financial and 
banking organizations in which dealing between states is 
achieved and also under the protection and encouragement of 
which, many states that produce raw materials have deposited 
their funds in American and European banks. 
  This measure gives a negative and even a very dangerous sign 
to Arab states that deposit funds and about the fate of the Arab 
people in the West's banks. Under the pretext of investing funds 
or protecting them from wastage and robbery, this measure 
confirms with irrefutable proof that the Arab funds in Western 
private and governmental banks are not immune, protected, or 
invested and there is no interest in their existence. 
  The measure which must be taken immediately and without 
official endorsement [as heard] is to withdraw these funds and 
bonds, and redeposit and reuse them in the Arab region, which is 
in most need of these funds in order to achieve its development, 
civilizational change, and the prosperity of its sons who are 
the ones entitled to their wealth.

  [Text] Tripoli, 1 May -- These days the British Government 
is waging a violent campaign against Iran under the pretext that 
Iran had contacts with the IRA. 
  The JANA international affairs editor commented on this, 
saying: This campaign is merely a repeated attempt on the part 
of Britain to falsify the truth and abolish rationality. This 
attempt is governed by a colonialist logic based on 
misrepresentation, deception, and turning the given facts upside 
down, if what gave rise to the British Government's rancor was 
the contact of a certain party with the IRA. 
  As it recently confessed, it was in official contact with 
this organization at a time when it was describing it as a 
terrorist organization and anyone who had contact with its 
members as a terrorist who supported terrorism. 
  But if the matter is related to aid from one party to 
another, in Britain's history and the behavior of its 
governments are matters which make it the first to be condemned 
and the first against whom a campaign should be waged motivated 
by the anger of peoples rather than those campaigns based on 
falsification. It has been noticed that it was Britain who 
received and provided support for the Iranian opposition. Now 
it is trying to cover up this stance by waging its propaganda 
campaign against Iran. 
  When it raises the Irish issue in this framework, it is 
trying at the same time to deceive peoples' minds by diverting 
attention to the essential cause of this problem which is its 
occupation of Ireland and its determination to colonize this 
country and deny Irish people the right to self-determination 
and then has recourse to pinning its evil actions on others. 
  The Editor added that what Britain is complaining about 
today 
is its own doing, as it is the one which occupied Ireland and 
the Irish people did not go to occupy Britain. It is also the 
state which built an empire on colonizing peoples and draining 
their wealth and is now reaping what its hands committed and 
that empire and its limbs were cut off by the struggle of 
peoples for freedom and independence. Britain has collapsed to 
the point where it retreated to its capital London and in front 
of which it is taking in its doorstep and might even retreat to 
beyond this capital unless it submits to the logic of right and 
law and abandons its behavior ruled by the colonialist and 
guardianship mentality and becomes aware of the fact that the 
resistance by the Irish -- whose fire is burning as the result 
of its occupation -- is not caused by Iran or anyone else. 
Britain has no other way to get out of this situation apart 
from ending its occupation of Ireland and letting the Irish 
people achieve self-determination.

  [Text] Tripoli, 1 May -- Brother Umar Mustafa al-Muntasir, 
the secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign 
Liaison and International Cooperation, has sent a message to 
Hamed Algabid, the secretary-general of the Islamic Conference 
Organization [ICO]. 
  In his letter he calls for the necessary contacts to be made 
regarding the call to ICO member countries to hold an emergency 
session of the conference of ICO foreign ministers before the 
date of this year's pilgrimage. The meeting would be to discuss 
the subject of Libyan pilgrims being impeded from carrying out 
the religious ceremony of pilgrimage, due to the unjust measures 
imposed by Western states via the Security Council, that would 
enable Libyan citizens to perform this religious duty free from 
the hindrances imposed by the resolutions of the Security 
Council. 
  In his message he emphasized that the resolutions of the 
Security Council which imposed an air embargo on the Great 
Jamahiriyah were in essence purely political resolutions which 
had led to Libyan pilgrims being impeded in the performance of 
their religious duty securely, peacefully and easily and had led 
brotherly Islamic states to assist the Security Council in its 
resolutions by stopping the Libyan people from getting to the 
holy mosque in Mecca.

  [Text] Sudan's security forces have arrested Major General 
Muhammad Ahmad prior to his departure from Khartoum to assume 
the post as his country's ambassador to Kenya. 
  The "Brothers" sources in Khartoum have confirmed that 
before 
his departure the major general had invited some of his military 
colleagues to a dinner at his house. Heading the list of guests 
was Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir. The sources said that 
the dinner invitation turned into an open dialogue between 
al-Bashir and the army officers, during which the latter 
severely criticized al-Bashir for neglecting the Army and 
thereby enabling the Islamic Front's cadres to seize power. The 
sources note that al-Bashir did not voice any objection to the 
officers' talk during dinner. 
  They said that al-Bashir left the dinner party and went 
directly to the house of the Front's interior minister, 
'Abd-al-Rahim Husayn, and told him there was a major coup plot 
under way by active and retired army officers led by Major 
General Ahmad, known as "Al-Sirr Ab Ahmad." He also told the 
interior minister that he personally had uncovered this plot 
while meeting with the officers. The sources added that the 
interior minister ordered the arrest of the major general and 
his officer colleagues. Their whereabouts remain unknown.

  [Text] Khartoum, April 30 (AFP) -- Fourteen opposition 
figures, including the army's former supreme commander, have 
been sentenced to between two and 10 years in jail for 
conspiring to topple the government, judicial officials said 
Saturday [30 April]. 
  A special civil tribunal announced it had sentenced nine out 
of 17 people tried in absentia to 10 years for conspiring 
against 'Umar al-Bashir's regime. 
  They included former army commander-in-chief General Fathi 
Ahmed Ali, former security chief General Al Hadi Bushra, and 
former Deputy Chief of Staff General Abdul Rahman Saeed. 
  They were charged with sending teams to Lebanon for 
explosives training in order to carry out sabotage and 
assassinations inside Sudan as a precursor to a coup. 
  The remaining eight tried in their absence were acquitted. 
  Five of the nine defendants present in court, who were 
arrested in May, were jailed for between two and seven years. 
  The remaining four were acquitted.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Sirab from the "Brothers" page] </F>
  [Text] In a sudden turn of events, the Sudanese People's 
Liberation Movement [SPLM], led by Colonel John Garang, has 
announced the formation of a new political and administrative 
entity it has christened "New Sudan." At the end of its 
general congress meetings, held near the Sudanese border with 
Uganda last week, the SPLM issued a statement. According to the 
statement, the SPLM congress formed an executive council and 
instructed it: 
  1. To seek self-determination for the "New Sudan" people. 
  2. To mobilize the country's resources for the war effort. 
  3. To separate civilian from military administration. 
  4. To create the necessary infrastructure for "New Sudan." 
  5. To create an independent judicial system. 
  6. To respect the law and protect human rights. 
  7. To issue a general amnesty for former insurgents. 
  With these seven tasks and the announcement of this new 
organization, the SPLM has taken a serious step toward the 
formation of a state completely separate from north Sudan. The 
statement defines the borders of New Sudan as those areas in 
south Kurdufan in western Sudan, areas south of the Blue Nile in 
eastern Sudan, and the three south districts of Upper Nile, 
Equatoria, and Bahr al-Ghazal. 
  According to political observers, the above resolutions run 
counter to all the agreements endorsed by the National 
Democratic Grouping [al-tajammu' al-watani al-dimuqrati; NDG]. 
The NDG's charter, which the SPLM had signed, calls for 
replacing the current regime in Sudan with a transitional 
democratic government and a multiparty system. 
  Observers say that the views of several northern political 
organizations, who support self-determination in south Sudan, 
have encouraged the SPLM to make this difficult decision. 
  According to African observers, Garang was under heavy 
pressure to take such a step. There has been unprecedented 
pressure for secession and the formation of an independent state 
in the south. Observers say that the 10-year war has taken its 
toll on the SPLM. 
  The sudden tack by Garang's group coincides with mounting 
unrest in Sudan. Antigovernment demonstrations were reported in 
Madani and al-Qadarif. The protests could threaten the regime's 
survival if they spread to Khartoum. 
  Observers say that the opening a new dialogue with Garang's 
SPLM would be useless so long as the National Islamic Front is 
in power. They add that Sudan's unity can only be preserved 
through swift action to bring down the regime.

    [Editorial Report] Baghdad Republic of Iraq Radio Network 
in Arabic at 2000 GMT on 30 April carries a "recording" of a 
28-minute off-the-cuff address delivered by Iraqi President 
Saddam Husayn to al-Anbar officials and residents during his 
visit to al-Anbar Governorate on 30 April. Reception ranges 
from fair to poor, with a number of indistinct passages. 
  Saddam begin his address by commenting on the speeches made 
by the al-Anbar dignitaries. He observes that, in their 
speeches, they began with history. This shows that the Iraqis 
and Arabs care about history and the past, just as they care 
about their future. He adds that the Arabs always stress the 
nonmaterial meanings of the past, citing a speaker who 
highlighted the historical status of al-Anbar in the past, 
rather than its material possessions. 
  Saddam adds that the most important thing he wishes for the 
people of al-Anbar is for history to record their positions so 
that their grandchildren may take pride in them. He tells them 
that every position has its rewards and consequences. Saddam 
then recalls his previous visits to al-Anbar. 
  Saddam continues to elaborate on the link between the past 
and the present, noting that the Arab nation is capable of 
making great achievements when it relies on God and gathers the 
necessary elements for success. He then talks about anti-Arab 
trends in the Arab world that have cast doubts on the Arab 
nation's present capabilities and argue that the past glory of 
the Arabs is over. 
  Addressing people of al-Anbar on this point, Saddam adds: 
"Your great role and the role of your people is that they have 
created a vital link between the present and the past." He then 
refutes charges that the Arabs do not know how to use their 
minds or how to utilize science. Saddam says science emerged 
first from Baghdad and then developed in other nations later 
when Baghdad retreated for reasons familiar to all historians. 
Saddam says this link between the past and the present is 
important because it enables the people to look toward the 
future with confidence. The present shows that the Arabs know 
how to respond to the scientific age in a balanced, correct 
fashion, because the Arabs have faith that puts science on its 
proper track. 
  Saddam tells the people of al-Anbar that their sacrifices 
provide strength to remedy the weakness on the part of certain 
Arabs and Arab officials who, wittingly or unwittingly, have 
taken a wrong course of action. 
  Saddam then recalls a conversation he had with an "Arab 
official" during the war with Iran. He says he had told the 
official that the Arabs should thank Iraq, not for the obvious 
reasons -- that Iraq is the eastern gate of the Arab nation and 
that it protects the nation, enabling many people to sleep 
peacefully when they could not before -- but because Iraq 
upholds the banner of the Arab nation and has given all Arabs a 
chance to demonstrate an honorable position, whether in words or 
by contributing money or troops. Saddam says that a right is 
not lost if someone continues to claim this right and fights to 
regain it. He recalls in this connection some battles fought in 
al-Anbar to regain its lost territory, thus showing the Arabs 
their history in the making. Saddam concludes his speech by 
thanking God for everything that has happened and praising God 
for everything that is yet to come. 
  The recording of the address ends at 2028 GMT.

  [Text] Baghdad, 30 Apr (INA) -- The paper AL-QADISIYAH has 
said that the basic objective of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's current tour is to impose U.S. decisions on the 
countries he will stop in--Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria--and 
to maintain pressure on Iraq, harm it, and continue the siege 
imposed on it in an attempt to achieve what the military 
aggression has failed to achieve. 
  In an article today under the headline "A New Chapter in the 
Scheme of Conspiracy," the paper adds that the priority given to 
discussions of the developments in the Arabian Gulf stems from 
heightened U.S. interest in the situation in this region and 
because Iraq has held fast in defiance of the forces of evil, 
conspiracy, and aggression, rebuilding all the pillars of 
advancement that the evil ones destroyed. 
  The paper says that recent international changes, 
particularly on the part of three permanent UN Security Council 
members, provide strong evidence that Iraq has an important 
regional and pan-Arab role, that it is part of the real world, 
and that it must be respected and dealt with seriously. It is 
useless for the United States and Britain to continue to ignore 
history and geography or to continue the imposition of the 
blockade against the steadfast Iraqi people.

  [Text] Baghdad, 1 May (INA)--In their editorials today, the 
Iraqi papers stress that Christopher's article in THE NEW YORK 
TIMES is nothing more than a reiteration of the same conniving 
U.S. stands aimed at fabricating pretexts and justifications to 
prolong the blockade and harm the leadership and people of Iraq. 
  The paper says that the lies included in Christopher's 
article are fabrications that will not stand up before the facts 
and that they are an obvious misrepresentation of reality and a 
sign of weakness, for a strong stand does not need lies to 
support it. 
  The papers add that Christopher's article is a nervous 
response to Iraq's diplomatic moves and the international 
changes acknowledging and praising Iraq's cooperation and 
calling for taking the required steps to remove the blockade 
after the disappearance of its justifications. 
  Under the headline "Iraq's steadfastness and Christopher's 
Allegations," AL-QADISIYAH says that thanks to its patience, 
jihad, balanced political stand, and the wisdom of its 
historical leadership, Iraq has destroyed the chapters of 
conspiracy against it. Despite their unfairness, Iraq has 
fulfilled its obligations fully toward relevant UN Security 
Council resolutions. This has been acknowledged by the fair UN 
Security Council member states and the special commissions that 
have dealt with those resolutions. 
  The paper explains that Christopher's stand reflects the 
reality of the tendentious and unjustified U.S. stand against 
Iraq, thus increasing U.S. isolation and showing that the United 
States is the sole power antagonizing Iraq and seeking to 
perpetuate the blockade against it. This is contrary to the 
will of the majority of permanent UN Security Council member 
states, other member states, and the rest of the world states 
that sympathize with Iraq's suffering and view positively its 
honoring of its obligations in accordance with UN Security 
Council resolutions. 
  Under the headline "Christopher Is Swimming Against the 
Current," AL-JUMHURIYAH says that Christopher has fallen into a 
glaring contradiction when, claiming to be speaking on behalf of 
the international community, he said that he opposes Iraq's 
efforts to have the blockade lifted. He said, however, that he 
sees that the unity of the Security Council has begun to 
disintegrate and that the majority of the international 
community are now in favor of lifting the blockade. He also 
said that a minority--specifically the United States and 
Britain--still want the blockade to continue. 
  The paper adds that some may think that like his president, 
Christopher may have little information about the suffering of 
the Iraqi people. But in his article, Christopher shows 
complete awareness and acknowledges the Iraqi people's 
suffering. Yet, he called for maintaining the blockade against 
Iraq, turning a blind eye to that fact and deliberately seeking 
to prolong that suffering. The paper asks: Can any double 
standard be clearer than this? 
  Under the headline "Exposed Fabrications in Warren 
Christopher's Article," AL-THAWRAH says: Warren Christopher's 
article reflects the embarrassing situation the U.S. 
Administration, led by Clinton, has put itself in as a result of 
its continued unjustified confrontation with Iraq and its 
desperate attempts to continue to harm Iraq by calling for 
tightening the blockade and extending it at every review session. 
  The paper adds that the U.S. secretary of state's article 
was 
a direct reply to the voices, which are growing louder even 
inside the United States, saying that the U.S. attitude not only 
conflicts with the changing international position but also with 
the interests of United States itself, especially after French, 
Italian, German, and Japanese companies have opened negotiations 
with Iraq to protect their interests. 
  The paper says Christopher's accusation that Iraq tried to 
assassinate criminal George Bush during his visit to Kuwait has 
been refuted by the trial of those accused of the attempt. The 
statements made by the defendants and the fact that the sessions 
have been adjourned several times to reach a verdict prove that 
the story is nothing more than a fabricated and exposed attempt 
aimed at maintaining a tense situation and pressing for 
continuing the blockade imposed on Iraq. 
  On Christopher's claims about the so-called displacement 
operations of Arabs in the marshlands, the paper says: The 
report prepared by a special UN committee -- formed to look into 
chemical use allegations propagated by Western quarters and 
Iranian authorities -- has conclusively refuted these 
allegations after examining all aspects of this affair. The 
committee would not have missed the slightest indication of such 
operations, especially since it hoped, along with those who sent 
it, to find even a shred of evidence to facilitate condemning 
Iraq. 
  On Christopher's allusion that Iraq is still holding Kuwaiti 
prisoners, the paper says Iraq is willing to cooperate with any 
party to ascertain the truth of the information sent by Iraq to 
the Arab League through its envoys who visited Iraq and saw with 
their own eyes that there are no Kuwaitis detained in Iraq. The 
latest Iraqi initiative in this regard was the invitation 
extended by the Iraqi National Assembly speaker to a Kuwaiti 
parliamentary delegation to visit Iraq and see that Iraq is not 
holding any Kuwaiti prisoners, but Kuwait has rejected the offer. 
  On Christopher's accusation that Iraq continues to produce 
weapons of mass destruction, AL-THAWRAH says: The statements of 
Rolf Ekeus are still fresh. Ekeus said two days ago, after 
meeting with Iraqi officials, that Iraq is cooperating with the 
Special Commission and that both sides are working together to 
shorten the trial period of the monitoring regime. Also, all 
reports by the UN committee supervising the destruction of 
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction show, in documents and 
figures, Iraq's full response to its demands to facilitate its 
mission. 
  On Christopher's talk about our beloved north and his 
accusation that Iraq is assassinating relief workers and UN 
observers, the paper wonders: Has Christopher forgotten that 
the region he is talking about is currently outside the control 
of the central authority and that the forces of his country and 
the allied states are supervising the region and claim to be 
providing security and peace for it? 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes: Christopher's article amounts to 
nothing more than a repeat of conniving U.S. positions that seek 
to create excuses and pretexts to maintain the blockade and 
target the people and leadership of Iraq, who have proven, 
through their remarkable steadfastness, that it is possible to 
defeat the schemes of the enemies. The enemies did not imagine 
Iraq would return a giant, as it was, having dealt it a blow 
with all of the weapons of mass destruction in their arsenal.

  [Text] New York, United Nations, 29 Apr (INA) -- Yesterday, 
after presenting a report to the Security Council about his 
mission in Baghdad, Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Security 
Council Special Commission, said that "Iraq is cooperating with 
the Special Commission. We are working together to shorten the 
trial period of the monitoring regime." Ekeus also said that he 
is very optimistic. 
  Ekeus added that the Security Council member states would 
like to have a monthly follow-up on the monitoring regime. 
Ekeus said: I have told them that the Committee has positive 
developments to report in all fields. 
  Ekeus noted that work on the monitoring regime in the 
missile 
and the chemical fields will be finished in May and in the 
biological field in June. 
  INA has learned that the PRC envoy has asked that the 
Security Council acknowledge the very positive developments in 
Iraq's implementation of UN resolutions. He suggested that the 
Security Council adopt a partial lifting of the blockade. 
  The Russian envoy also spoke about the need to give Iraq a 
chance for more cooperation. The British envoy acknowledged 
that progress had been made and that Ekeus' report to the 
Security Council was encouraging.

  [Text] Damascus, April 30 (AFP)--An Iraqi Kurdish 
opposition group on Saturday alleged China was supplying Iraq 
with chemical weapons through a third country. 
  "Kurdish police intercepted on the night of April 17 two 
trucks carrying 19 tonnes of sodium phosphate used to make 
mustard gas and chemical weapons," a statement by the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said. 
  The chemicals were smuggled into Iraq through a 
"neighbouring" third country, according to the statement 
received here by AFP which did not identify the country. 
  The truck drivers "admitted during questioning" they were 
trying to transport the chemicals through Kurdish-controlled 
northern Iraq to regions controlled by the Iraqi central 
government.

<F P=106> ["Clarification" by unidentified official spokesman of the </F>
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan; date and place not given--read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] During an interview with Radio Monte Carlo, Jalal 
Talabani, secretary general of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan 
[PUK], spoke frankly about several important issues, including 
an attempt by the Iraqi regime to negotiate with the Kurdish 
people's liberation movement. He explained the PUK's 
understanding of this issue. It is worth noting that certain 
parties used particular parts of the interview for their own 
interpretations and to serve their own objectives. Therefore, 
to avoid misleading the masses or distorting the PUK's views and 
policies, we would like to declare to the masses of Kurdistan 
that the PUK considers federalism a gain for Kurdistan because 
it establishes the status of Kurdistan within an Iraqi framework 
on a federal basis. The PUK considers this to be the fruit of 
the blood of hundreds of thousands of martyrs and of a long and 
bitter struggle by the Kurdish people. 
  The PUK played an effective and important role and has made 
sacrifices to accomplish this. Under no circumstances will the 
PUK accept lesser gains for narrow party interests and 
developments; this is impossible. 
  Self-rule is not a PUK slogan. However, no other political 
party can be prevented from raising the self-rule slogan instead 
of the slogan of obtaining our people's legitimate rights. The 
PUK adheres to the idea of federalism in form and content. 
Establishing relations between the Kurds and Arabs in Iraq on 
the basis of federalism without achieving democracy remains an 
impossible dream. Therefore, eliminating the dictatorship and 
achieving democracy in Iraq are two prerequisites for 
establishing and safeguarding federalism in Kurdistan and Iraq. 
  Negotiating with Saddam Husayn for any reason whatsoever 
will 
only result in repeating the tragedies of the Kurdish people and 
the destruction of Kurdistan. 
  All the countries and people of the world consider Saddam 
Husayn and his regime to be big war criminals, genocidal 
criminals, and a contributing factor to instability in the 
region. Negotiations between Kurds or any Kurdistan party in 
Iraq with this regime constitutes a link with a collapsing 
regime that is ostracized by the countries of the region and the 
world. In effect it would mean substituting a considerable and 
realistic gain for an illusion. 
  The PUK considers dialogue one of the ways and means of 
struggle. However, initiating a dialogue with Saddam 
Husayn--with his criminal killers of Kurds, enemies of mankind, 
democracy, peace, and human rights, the chauvinists, and 
racists--would be inexcusable under the current circumstances. 
This is because Saddam Husayn and the Ba'thists do not 
recognize any of our Kurdish people's rights. They consider 
death and destruction as the only legitimate right we Kurdish 
people have left. 
  Our people have tried to engage in dialogues with the Iraqi 
regime several times, and they must have learned a lesson from 
this experience. The Baghdad regime may provide funds and arms 
to those who side with it, but it will never recognize the 
Kurdish people's rights, nor will it improve the living 
conditions of the Kurds. 
  The PUK considers the gains made in Iraqi Kurdistan, 
embodied 
in the parliament and federal government, freedom, and peace, to 
be great gains that cannot be safeguarded through dialogue with 
Saddam Husayn. In fact, a dialogue with Saddam Husayn might 
destroy these gains. Safeguarding these gains can be achieved 
through the unity of the people and cooperation among the 
Kurdistan Front parties and the sons of our people. We believe 
that safeguarding and promoting these gains is a turning point 
for establishing a firm entity in Kurdistan. No one has a right 
to make us lose this opportunity.

al-Suhayl Murder"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A movement calling 
itself the "National Resistance" in Iraq has announced its 
intention to avenge the assassination of Iraqi oppositionist 
Talib al-Suhayl, who was killed by the Iraqi intelligence 
service in Beirut. In leaflets it distributed in a number of 
districts in the Iraqi capital the movement said that some 
people have named the main street leading to al-Shu'lah area in 
Baghdad "al-Suhayl Street." The movement said that the murdered 
oppositionist was "the toughest defender of freedoms and 
democracy for 30 years." 
  Arrivals from Iraq say that these leaflets were distributed 
at night in front of houses, shops, and schools. It is the 
first time this movement has distributed leaflets in Baghdad and 
a number of major cities. 
  Meanwhile, some leaders of the Iraqi Tamim tribes, one of 
whose senior leaders was al-Suhayl, have met to discuss steps to 
be taken to retaliate against the government, including pursuing 
those who planned and implemented the operation and all those 
who took part in watching and supplying information about 
al-Suhayl's movements from inside and outside Iraq. Arrivals 
from Baghdad say that security authorities have encircled a 
number of houses belonging to senior Tamim tribal chiefs in 
anticipation of violent incidents.

<F P=106> [Report by Gerhard Bitzan: "United States Insists on Iraq </F>
Boycott by All Means"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- 'Abd al-Razak al-Hashimi, director of the 
foreign office of the Iraqi Ba'th Party, accuses the United 
States of wanting to maintain the international boycott against 
Iraq by all means. "The United States prevents the UN Security 
Council from lifting the sanctions; and this even though Iraq 
has fulfilled all demands and resolutions." The foreign leader 
of the state party also criticizes the United States with regard 
to Kuwait: "Kuwait was not the point for them, because the 
crisis has long passed, more than three years have passed. But 
the United States is maintaining the sanctions. This shows that 
the problem was not Kuwait." 
  Al-Hashimi also complains about international propaganda: 
"We are accused of still having Kuwaiti prisoners. Commissions 
visited us, which confirmed our claims -- there are no 
prisoners. We have even invited Kuwaiti parliamentarians, but 
they rejected the invitation." 
  Regarding the latest attacks on UN employees in northern 
Iraq, al-Hashimi says that this area is not under government 
control; therefore, Baghdad rejects all accusations that its 
agents have carried out these attacks. "The Kurds in this zone 
know now that things were much better in the past. The problem 
is foreign interference. There will only be a solution if the 
foreign powers leave the country. We will get along well with 
the Kurds." 
  For al-Hashimi the most important thing is that the 
sanctions 
are lifted, "that the Iraqi nation has enough to eat." He sees 
signs of a softening: "The United States cannot prevent that 
anymore. Sooner or later the boycott will be lifted." In this 
period, which is so difficult for Iraq, one is choosing the 
friends, and also future business partners, who will then 
already have a foothold in Iraq as soon as the sanctions are 
lifted, al-Hashimi says temptingly.

  [Text] Baghdad, Apr. 27, INA--AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper of 
Baghdad today said ideas of the former American President 
Richard Nixon had greatly influenced the behaviours of President 
Bill Clinton and boosting his antagonism to Iraq. 
  A paper editorial said that viewpoints of President Nixon 
toward Iraq, which were reflected in his book had equalled 
between the danger of Iraq to the West with that of the Soviet 
Union and pointed out that Bill Clinton insists on obstructing 
the lifting of the embargo so that Iraq would not resume its 
liberation role for peace, stability and justice in the region. 
  The paper said that Nixon, in his book admits that the 
influence of Saddam Husayn's Iraq bypasses its geographic size 
and makes it in the same level of influence of the Soviet Union 
toward international events. 
  The Iraqi paper further said that the former American 
president added in his book that Saddam Husayn's Iraq and the 
Soviet Union represented the most significant dangers and 
challenges that had faced the world. 
  It explained that Nixon assessments were based on various 
political and geopolitical realities that could not be 
concealed, prominent among which is that Iraq is considered one 
of the few countries that would have an essential role in world 
economy, the world technological growth and the balances of 
regional and international forces. 
  Referring to the factor of oil, the paper said that oil is 
an 
effective power in the hand of Iraq and that oil would remain 
the major source of energy in the world for another century and 
consequently the one who dominates oil would have an effective 
role in the world of tomorrow. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper said the second effective power is 
technology which started to be acquired by most nations and had 
minimized the importance of some countries that had 
technological supermacy. 
  The paper added that patriotic policy also influences the 
role of countries in international events and that the 
independent political course of some world countries has become 
a giant power feared by the big powers which try to place the 
world under their hegemony. 
  The paper linked this reality with the plots and aggressive 
plans and said that America resolved to destroy countries that 
maintain an independent course like Yugoslavia and that its 
attempts with Iraq had failed. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH expressed conviction over having oil as a 
strong weapon in the hands of Iraq alongside other weapons for 
the sake of confirming its effective role and position in the 
region and said that the independent policy of Iraq represents 
the basic guarantee for having oil away from imperialist 
domination and turning technology into a striking power in 
steadfastness and progress. 
  The paper said that all those facts interpreted Nixon 
outlook 
toward Iraq and were represented in the fact that Saddam 
Husayn's iraq constitutes an obstacle that could not be removed 
before the attempts of American imperialism dominates the world 
and that is why we see Clinton insists on obstructing the 
lifting of the embargo imposed on Iraq.

<F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "Not Just the Allies: America </F>
Too"] 
  [Text] Whoever thinks America's allies and supporters in 
the 30-state aggression against our country are the only ones 
who changed their positions on the embargo on Iraq is totally 
mistaken. This is because America itself is facing a new move 
from within that centers on a demand to reestablish relations 
with Iraq and end the embargo. Taking part in this move are 
senior politicians, Congress members, researchers, and, above 
all, prominent businessmen. 
  Some Congress members like Lee Hamilton, head of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee at the U.S. House of Representatives, and 
Senator David Banner [name as published] began to question the 
wisdom behind continuing the embargo. Moreover, the two most 
important newspapers in America; namely, THE NEW YORK TIMES and 
THE WASHINGTON POST, are talking in a new language about the 
embargo, demanding that it should be lifted because it is no 
longer justified and because of Iraq's cooperation with the 
United Nations. The dissatisfaction was not confined only to 
elements in both political and media quarters, but also included 
the economic quarter. Many U.S. companies in the sectors of 
agriculture, oil, and car and airplane manufacturing began to 
talk about their losses as a result of the embargo on Iraq. 
  Former U.S. Congress member Mervin Dimely [name as 
published] 
noted that the losses are estimated at more than $2 billion in 
certain sectors. Therefore, preparations have begun to hold a 
conference organized by American companies in Washington in May. 
These companies called on the secretary of energy and secretary 
of commerce to attend the conference in order to discuss the 
negative effects of the embargo on the U.S. economy. Because 
the three powers in America -- the political, media, and 
economic powers -- are beginning to witness dissatisfaction and 
an inclination toward lifting the embargo, this means action 
against the embargo has begun in America as well as in other 
countries. Here we can say that these positive changes have 
taken place thanks to the steadfastness and sacrifices of the 
Iraqi people and to the greatness of their leader Saddam Husayn. 
Therefore, in order for these developments to reach a positive 
result, we must reinforce the base of steadfastness and broaden 
the rallying around President Saddam Husayn. We must move on 
all diplomatic, commercial, media, and organizational levels to 
cut short the time for achieving great changes.

  [Article by Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar: "The Success 
and Failure of U.S. Plans in Light of the Leader's Speech"] 
  [Text] Some might not be aware of the consequences of 
promoting confused political views ostensibly grounded in common 
sense, but which when subjected to a thorough and serious 
examination, turn out to be serious attempts at deception. An 
example of this is the argument promoted in various parts of the 
world that world events are determined by the decisions of 
superpowers, which cannot be conquered by medium-sized and small 
powers. Consequently, these humble powers eventually succumb. 
This argument is promoted particularly by West-educated 
individuals, and among quarters that maintain cultural and 
political ties with the West. 
  This argument gained wide circulation in the aftermath of 
the 
the collapse of East Europe and the disintegration of the former 
Soviet Union. The aim has been to prove that U.S. decisions 
always triumph, and that whatever the United States wants, the 
United States gets. It is ironic that this argument is being 
promoted in this age of decadence by intellectuals and thinkers 
who in the past depicted themselves as advocates of liberation 
and progress. These people are promoting this argument under 
the guise of having to demonstrate "rationality, realism, and 
in-depth knowledge." Nonetheless, it has to be remembered that 
these very individuals are well aware in their heart of hearts 
that a thorough analysis of the current state of affairs would 
point to the opposite of what they are promoting. 
  Given all this, and to dispel any delusions that might be 
harbored here or there, we must pose a specific and direct 
question, particularly since we are now in the final chapter of 
the embargo. This question is as follows: Is it true that U.S. 
plans and decisions are fail proof, and that peoples have to 
succumb to U.S. hegemony? Well, we will not answer this 
question by way of theoretical exposition and analysis. Rather, 
we will address the international situations in which the United 
States made the crucial decision and went to war to vindicate 
that decision. 
  For example, in World War II, the war was not settled by a 
U.S. decision. Indeed, the Soviet Red Army played the crucial 
role in defeating Germany. Concerning the European and U.S. 
contribution to the war effort in World War II, it comes next to 
the Soviet Red Army's contributions. It has to be recalled that 
the United States got involved in the war only in the aftermath 
of the Pearl Harbor incident. 
  Similarly, in the early 50's, the United States went to war 
on the Korean peninsula to prevent liberation forces there from 
reaching power. However, the result was that the United States 
was defeated, and the Korean revolutionaries established a base 
in the north, which is now called the DPRK, one that has 
remained very much alive. 
  Additionally, the United States experienced abysmal defeat 
when it attempted to knock off the Cuban revolution. This 
failure is still a hard fact although Cuba is only 90 miles from 
Miami Beach. It is to be recalled that the Castro-led Cuban 
liberation revolution triumphed 33 years ago. As for Fidel 
Castro, he has remained a nationalist and socialist hero. He is 
persisting in the fight against U.S. colonialism. This U.S. 
defeat acquires greater significance when we realize that the 
United States has a huge military base on Cuban territory. 
  When France fled Vietnam after the Dien Bien Phu battle, the 
United States thought that it was in a better position than 
France to dominate the Vietnamese. This prompted it to embroil 
itself in the Vietnamese mire for several years. Consequently, 
it lost 50,000 American lives, and many times this number in 
wounded and handicapped Army personnel. The Vietnam war brought 
about early recession to the U.S. economy. It is true that the 
United States was not defeated in a crucial military battle in 
Vietnam, as was the case with France. However, it suffered a 
strategic defeat when it lost the will to fight. That is why 
its military command fled Vietnam from the rooftop of the U.S. 
Embassy in Saigon in a most disgraceful and cowardly act. The 
U.S. military command left 1 million South Vietnamese troops to 
face their destiny there. Hence, the Vietnam complex that 
surfaced in the United States. 
  What happened in Vietnam also happened in Laos, Cambodia, 
and Latin America, where nationalist revolutionaries achieved 
victory by force of arms, although they are in the "back yard" 
of America. In our homeland, the region has never seen a 
colonialist force that is more cowardly than America. The 
demolition of the Marines' headquarters in Lebanon and the 
killing of more than 200 soldiers showed the fragility of the 
U.S. decision. After Ronald Reagan's fiery and strong decisions 
to invade Lebanon and to destroy it, the decision was changed 
and the Marines withdrew in a humiliating way. 
  In Africa, America and its agents were defeated in Zimbabwe 
-- formerly Rhodesia -- Ethiopia, and elsewhere. In the Arab 
homeland, there was also the 17-30 July Revolution in 1968, 
which made great changes despite America and its continuous 
conspiracies. 
  These examples prove, without any doubt, that America did 
not 
achieved any strategic victory until the late eighties. In 
fact, it sustained strategic defeats wherever it interfered. 
Its decisions were defeated. The "Vietnam complex" was 
aggravated in a way that encouraged the American public to exert 
pressures to resort to the policy of isolation. 
  However, some might wonder and say: The collapse of East 
Europe, the disintegration of the USSR, and the nineties all 
indicate that America has achieved victory. This question is 
immaterial. One of the facts revealed in 1993, which were mere 
conclusions in 1992, shows that the collapse of the USSR was due 
to two essential factors: The first factor is the corrupt 
social-economic system and its party tool, which was the factor 
that contributed the most to the collapse, because it paved the 
way for the emergence of the second factor: The internal 
treason represented by the decision of Michail Gorbachev and his 
clique to premeditatedly partition the USSR, as Yanayev, who was 
Gorbachev's deputy, said. 
  Here, we can say that the only big strategic victory scored 
by America was not military, but an intelligence victory by 
which America succeeded in winning over Gorbachev and turning 
him into an ideological agent who destroyed the USSR and paved 
the way for Soviet intelligence to destroy Communism in East 
Europe. 
  The categorical evidence of the soundness of what we are 
saying is the current situation. Apart from America's victory 
in the field of intelligence, what is left is a series of 
defeats that resulted in the downfall of Bush and a change in 
the comprehensive global strategy. America tried to deceive the 
world by propagating the prevalence of the American era, 
leadership, and model of life. It embodied this ideologically 
by presenting Fukiyama's theory of the end of history. 
Following all this, America began to face serious challenges 
beginning with the severe Iraqi blow in the Mother of Battles 
which exposed America's shames and weakness as noted by leader 
President Saddam Husayn in his address on 17 April 1994. 
  Iraq fought, remained steadfast, and triumphed over the most 
brutal and most serious military campaign in history, in which 
the weapons of the 21st Century, prepared to destroy the Soviet 
Union, were used against it. This is despite the fact that all 
U.S. officials and writers affirmed that the Saddam Husayn 
regime would end within a month. However, years have passed and 
Iraq's strength has been doubled and become historic, thereby 
forcing U.S. intelligence to admit there is no hope of changing 
the Iraqi regime. 
  The mere survival of Saddam Husayn's Iraq in the face of the 
barbaric and fascist onslaught is a great strategic victory that 
has shaken the pillars of the evil empire led by Bush. As a 
result of Iraq's victory and heroic steadfastness, Russia woke 
up from America's morphine and began its struggle against its 
hegemony. We are now witnessing Russia's swift return to the 
scene of world events in defiance of America, which decided to 
divide Russia as it divided the Soviet Union. America, however, 
failed in dividing Russia. 
  Somalia, the small starving state, forced America to 
withdraw 
with humiliation. This showed once again that it is ready to 
withdraw and change stands under the first signs of pressure. 
  In Haiti, the regime the United States wanted to replace is 
still steadfast and is still challenging the United States. 
Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which the United States wanted to 
dominate the region in cooperation with the Zionist entity, have 
become fragile entities on the verge of collapse, especially 
Egypt, which is being stormed by an armed national revolution 
that is hostile to the United States and Zionism. 
  In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the republics of the former Soviet 
Union, and eastern Europe the situation is plagued with 
unprecedented confusion. This has led to the return of 
socialists and nationalist forces to their leading role in the 
society. Even the United States' closest ally, Japan, has begun 
to rebel against paternal U.S. hegemony. Japan strongly said no 
to the United States. The European Union is also working 
seriously to achieve its independence. 
  In Asia, the Chinese giant is waking up to teach the United 
States lessons in international politics and to keep the United 
States from imposing its hegemony over the Korean peninsula and 
Chinese decision making. China has stopped bowing to the U.S. 
tempest. The most obvious picture of U.S. failure is the 
disintegration of the anti-Iraq front at the Security Council 
and the United Nations, as well as the emergence of big powers 
and other powers demanding an end to the blockade on Iraq in 
spite of the United States. 
  In light of these defeats and this public U.S. failure 
throughout the world, the United States can no longer repeat 
Bush's silly talk that the world has become stable, that 
conflicts have ended, and that peace has prevailed as a result 
of U.S. dominance. A new theory emerged called the conflict of 
cultures by American Professor Samuel Huntington [name as 
published] to replace the theory that is called the end of 
history in the U.S. black house. According to this theory, the 
world is a dangerous jungle full of wars and ethnic, cultural, 
and religious mines. The reasons for wars and clashes have 
become cultural rather than ideological or economic. 
  This theory prevails in the Bill Clinton era just as 
Fukiyama's theory prevailed in the Bush era. This clearly shows 
the failure of the planned global strategy, as well as the U.S. 
failure to dominate the world. 
  Therefore, leader President Saddam Husayn's conversation 
with 
the commanders who liberated al-Faw is an ingenious and sound 
analysis of one of the world's most important issues pertaining 
to the blockade imposed on Iraq. Contrary to what is being 
spread by the U.S propaganda machine -- that breaking or 
maintaining the blockade should be purely an American decision 
and that the other states, including Iraq, cannot affect that 
decision -- we say breaking the blockade will be an Iraqi 
decision that will be implemented, thanks to the Iraqi people's 
will and steadfastness and to President Saddam Husayn's 
leadership. Just as it was defeated in Vietnam and other places 
and failed in the nineties to invest in the unique opportunity 
following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States 
will be defeated in the battle of the blockade. 
  Wellbeing is coming, wellbeing is coming not because the 
evil 
ones intend to lift the evil, but because we know that the fist 
that seizes the sword by its blade will be forced to ease the 
grip when the owner of the sword pulls the sword forcefully. 
When the owner of the sword pulls the sword forcefully, the 
adversary will find himself compelled to release his grip on the 
sword or risk losing his fingers. In either case, he will have 
to release the sword. In this ingenious talk, the leader 
defines the future of the blockade. The United States will be 
compelled to retreat, cancel all its threats and decisions, and 
bow in respect to the Iraq of the martyrs and Saddam Husayn, 
whose slap to the face of George Bush awoke the world. 
  The United States is burdened with the factors of collapse. 
Month after month, it becomes weaker and weaker. The price it 
will pay for its crimes against Iraq will double. Our people, 
who achieved the impossible and foiled U.S. decisions during the 
Iranian aggression on Iraq, will be able to cut off the fingers 
of the United States, which is now seizing Iraq's sword by the 
blade. The Iraqi people will adopt decisive decisions and will 
push history against the current the United States wants.

<F P=106> ["Attention" column by Hasan al-Kashif: "America...Rise and </F>
Downfall"] 
  [Text] It is not strange that the United States is 
beginning its fall from the summit it enjoyed for a few years. 
To stay on the world's summit requires much more than brute 
force and technical, military, and media superiority. This 
requires a humanitarian message that convinces the world's 
peoples. This is something Washington does not have, as U.S. 
circles admit. 
  Some confused people do not see the U.S. slide, but continue 
to see the old upward trend. These people do not see the 
opportunities in the region and the international arena. 
  Even more serious is the fact that these people have seen 
the 
U.S. progress, but they did not note -- due to their horror and 
blindness -- that this climb to the summit of global positions 
was due to notable collapses. This means the United States 
moved forward because there was no resistance, or, let us say, 
it moved ahead as a result of multiple absences. The collapse 
of the Soviet Union was basically due to self-motivated reasons, 
and the same was the case with countries of former Socialist 
bloc. The collapse of Somalia was due to famine and fighting. 
The official Arab journey to Madrid was the result of the 
collapse of rulers and officials. Therefore, the U.S. rise 
cannot be viewed as a victory over heroic and persistent 
resistance. 
  The only exception during the short years of the U.S. rise 
was Iraq. Iraq has been and still is the one voicing the 
pan-Arab and humanitarian 'no', with faith in God, people, and 
objectives. That was the reason for the 30-state aggression and 
all its destruction and siege. Despite everything it did, the 
United States stood helpless and defeated under the walls of the 
Iraqi fortress while in the zenith of its rise. 
  Now, the image is different. The U.S. downfall is becoming 
clearer. Iraq remained and its leadership and determination 
continued without change. The Russian awakening is clear. 
Somalia is witnessing the triumph of its resistance. The 
people of Palestine were not deceived by the false peace and its 
agreements and negotiators. Palestinians continue to throw 
stones and to fire bullets, rejecting the results of the 
collapse of officials and rulers. 
  None of us denies Washington owns huge quantities of 
sophisticated weapons and possesses advanced media. We all 
suffered from the air, missile, and media shelling, but this did 
not undermine the Iraqis and the Arabs, and did not deceive the 
Somalis and Russians for long. Army occupation does not mean 
occupation of the will. Monopolizing the media does not 
necessarily mean occupying the mind. 
  At the peak of the hostile media campaign that took part in 
the destructive aggression and siege, the faith of the Arab 
nation in Iraq -- leader and people -- increased, even though 
Iraqi media did not reach all Arab lands. 
  At the peak of the military and media invasion of Somalia, 
the Somali people rejected the invasion and its pretexts, even 
though the Somali people did not have enough bread and lack even 
modest mass media. 
  When all the hostile media that targeted Iraq mobilized 
against the Palestinian people, and inundated them with the 
promises of peace, prosperity, and stability, the Palestinian 
people -- who lack their own media that believe in national and 
pan-Arab constant -- were not deceived. They continued to fight 
the enemy as an alternative to negotiating with the enemy. 
  The changes demonstrated much of what Iraq had said and 
predicted during the peak of the collapses that shocked the 
world, but did not move Iraq. 
  The United States is in the downfall stage, and Iraq -- 
leader and people -- and Palestine -- people and resistance -- 
are in the rising stage amid a clear awakening that is 
demonstrated in the division in the Security Council.

<F P=106> [From the "Standpoint" column: "Ending Intervention Is the </F>
Solution" by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi] 
  [Text] The incident involving the shooting down of two U.S. 
helicopters by two missiles fired from two U.S. F-15 aircraft in 
northern Iraq reveals the evils and dangers of continued foreign 
intervention in the affairs of Iraq. Those evils and dangers 
have harmed and are harming not only Iraq, but also the 
intervening sides themselves and the neighboring country of 
Turkey, on whose territory the foreign intervention forces are 
stationed. 
  The U.S. Administration has tried to mislead many people by 
saying that its intervention in Iraq's internal affairs and the 
presence of the coalition forces in Turkey are aimed at 
enforcing a security zone in northern Iraq and maintaining the 
security and stability of the region. So, what are the results 
of this aggressive U.S. intervention? 
  One main result of this intervention is that it has 
undermined Iraq's sovereignty, although the U.S. Administration 
and the coalition forces say that they support Iraq's unity and 
territorial integrity and oppose any action that is prejudicial 
to its sovereignty. 
  Another result of this aggressive intervention is what we 
see 
happening in northern Iraq today; acts of murder, destruction, 
plunder, and sabotage of all that the 17-30 July Revolution and 
the autonomy institutions have built for the well-being of our 
Kurdish people in the Autonomous Region. 
  Incidents are reported every day in which government 
officials and foreign news correspondents become victims due to 
the lack of security and the physical liquidations taking place 
between numerous foreign elements and agent parties in northern 
Iraq. 
  Some U.S. quarters have tried to blame Iraq for the 
incidents 
taking place in that region, where conditions are unnatural and 
unsafe due to the continuous foreign intervention and where 
gangs of agents, vagabonds, and robbers have taken over control 
under foreign protection. Let us ask: How can any country in 
the world guarantee security in a region which is not under the 
direct control of its security organs? 
  Whoever follows events will discover that foreign 
intervention is not in anyone's interest. 
  This intervention, which directly affects Iraq, since it is 
taking place on its territory and undermining its national 
sovereignty, is also detrimental to the interests of the 
coalition states themselves, especially the neighboring country 
of Turkey, which Iraq has never tried to harm, and with which 
Iraq has sought good-neighborly relations and strong economic 
ties. 
  What has the United States gained from its continuous 
intervention in northern Iraq and the continued presence of its 
forces in Turkey? 
  The United States and some of its Western allies have gained 
nothing but disappointment and failure. As for Iraq, it 
overcame its ordeal a long time ago when it confronted the 
coalition aggression and when its struggler people resisted in 
the Mother of Battles and reconstructed what was destroyed by 
aggression. 
  Washington and its Western allies reaped failure and losses 
and its hostile program witnessed repeated defeats. Perhaps, 
the shooting down of the two U.S. helicopters by two U.S. 
fighter bombers is best proof of this disappointment and the 
failure of the policy of intervention in Iraq's affairs. 
  All the claims about safeguarding security and human rights 
which President Bill Clinton's advisers bragged about have all 
fallen at once. 
  Of all Iraqi territory, the region witnessing the 
intervention of the aggressor states is the only one lacking 
security. 
  As for the question of human rights, it is a ridiculous 
issue 
of U.S. foreign policy, because the Clinton administration, 
which talks about human rights, did not hesitate to kill 15 
Americans and others of different nationalities, including 
Kurds, thinking the helicopters were Iraqi. 
  The U.S. Administration needs to make a general revision of 
its entire policy in the region, especially toward Iraq. Iraqi 
national unity has all the historical bases and means of 
continuity and viability in the present and the future. 
Washington itself admits this fact. Therefore, the recent 
incident must sound the alarm concerning the continuation of 
intervention. The recent U.S. decision to suspend flights over 
northern Iraq does not offer a solution. The correct solution 
which responds to the interests of Iraq, Turkey, and other 
states in the region is withdrawing the coalition forces from 
the region and building correct relations which will meet 
everyone's legitimate interests. 
  Therefore, what is correct is for the United States to stop 
intervening in Iraq's affairs, pull its forces out from the 
region and adopt new relations with Iraq based on accommodation 
and achieving common interests, and abandoning the policy of 
saber rattling and threats of intervention, because developments 
and facts have proven the futility of this policy.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi: "Human </F>
Rights and the Hypocrisy of the Imperialist West"] 
  [Text] The recent statement by Dr. Muhammad al-Mas'ari, one 
of the founders of the Committee in Defense of Legitimate Rights 
in Saudi Arabia, in which he said that "Saudi Arabia's record of 
violation of human rights is the worst in the world" reveals the 
extent of political hypocrisy the imperialist West is practicing 
concerning the subject of human rights on the international 
level. 
  This is because this committee, which includes several Saudi 
lawyers, academics, and men of religion who oppose persecution, 
corruption, and violation of human rights in Saudi Arabia and 
whose members are subjected to various forms of murder, 
imprisonment, torture, and pursuit, is crying out day and night, 
collecting evidences and facts, and presenting documents on the 
Saudi regime's violations of human rights. Yet the imperialist 
West turns a deaf ear to these violations and laments human 
rights in other countries where individuals live in dignity and 
honor and work for their countries' development and progress. 
  For instance, we hear Max Van Der Stoel [UN rapporteur on 
Iraqi human rights] howling about alleged human rights 
violations in Iraq and Sudan, yet he and his overlords know that 
human rights are violated only in countries under imperialist 
domination, and that the Saudi regime provides one of the 
outstanding examples of real and serious violation of human 
rights. 
  The human rights committee in Saudi Arabia strives to 
achieve 
certain basic demands for the individual, and one would assume 
that these demands are achievable at any time and place. 
However, the savageness of the Saudi regime and the imperialist 
regimes' condoning of the savageness and tyranny to which 
individuals are exposed in Saudi Arabia has encouraged Fahd's 
regime to continue persecuting the Arab masses there. 
  Human rights standards are supposed to be the same 
everywhere 
in the world. They are also supposed to be harmonious with the 
World Declaration of Human Rights and other UN conventions and 
to be applied correctly, not selectively. Therefore, violating 
these rights in Saudi Arabia and lamenting them in Iraq, Sudan, 
and other countries, as Van Der Stoel and others in the U.S. 
State Department would have it, is unacceptable under any 
circumstances. Moreover, they cannot convince anyone and their 
actions cannot but be disapproved and ridiculed by all free men 
in the world. 
  A review of the world's record on human rights will reveal 
many Western scandals in this regard. The imperialist West 
defends the most oppressive and terroristic regimes in the 
world. It defends the Zionist entity, which kills Arabs en 
masse, plunges them into prisons and detention camps, blows up 
their homes, burns their farms and plantations, and expels them 
from their country, Palestine. The imperialist West also 
defends the Saudi regime, which throws strugglers into prisons 
or drops them from planes to be devoured by ravenous beasts in 
the desert. The Saudi regime also bans the freedom of speech 
and the establishment of political parties. Saudi Arabia has 
not witnessed any real parliamentary system expressing the 
demands and aspirations of the Arab people in the Arabian 
Peninsula. Furthermore, the Saudi regime is not known to 
respect public opinion. 
  This Western political hypocrisy expresses the barbaric 
mentality of imperialism and its disregard for human rights when 
the matter concerns those who are outside the circle of 
imperialist domination. This is well understood by 
freedom-loving peoples, which is why they are always struggling 
to achieve their basic human rights away from the mentality and 
aggressive plans of the imperialists, who only care about their 
interests and commercial markets; indeed, everything commercial.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Mu'ayyad 'Abd-al-Zahrah: "These </F>
Iranian Claims and Calumnies"] 
  [Text] Iran has made claims about the arrest of several 
Iranian men of religion who live in Iraq. We will be revealing 
nothing new if we say the Tehran regime has told such obvious 
lies about Iraq before, told them during and after the war, and 
still tells them, up to this moment. Its various organizations 
are accustomed to making claims, telling lies, disseminating 
false reports, and distorting facts in order to level all kinds 
of accusations and to justify their instigation, subversion, and 
impertinent interferences. Their record in this field has a 
beginning but no end. It will apparently end only with their 
downfall and demise. This is probably because Iraq, which has 
exposed their aggressive tendencies, buried their criminal 
adventures, suppressed their well-known greed, and put an end to 
their calumnies, has confused them, uncovered them, and exposed 
their bankrupt policy and evil nature. 
  Iraq is accustomed to hearing these lies from the 
ayatollahs' 
regime. It expects to hear even more from time to time, because 
this is their way of avoiding the overwhelming political, 
economic, and internal problems threatening their overthrow. 
Therefore, we were not surprised when they readily announced 
that Iraq was behind the recent big explosion in the Iranian 
capital, although opposition Islamic Iranian groups in Pakistan 
claimed responsibility for the explosion. 
  Iraq has shown flexibility by expressing unlimited positive 
readiness to settle its outstanding problems with Iran by 
peaceful means, on the basis of noninterference in each other's 
affairs, and respecting each other's sovereignty. This 
flexibility expresses Iraq's great desire to end the dispute 
with Iran. It was and is met with more arrogance, evasion, and 
a continuing policy of treachery and interference in the 
internal affairs of Iraq. This is happening now in the northern 
part of the homeland and in other areas, via infiltration and 
sabotage. We have enough evidence to expose all these 
continuous evil and mean Iranian practices and tendencies. 
  Persisting in making these repeated claims against Iraq is a 
miserable old policy. It has lost any of its long since exposed 
currency, as in the case of the fact finding mission's recent 
statement refuting Iran's false claims about Iraqi use of 
chemical weapons in the marshlands. 
  These people had better hide in shame -- if they are ashamed 
of themselves -- now that their lies have been exposed to the 
whole world. We will not say that Iranians know the lies of the 
ayatollahs even better. But we advise Tehran's rulers, as we 
have often done, to tend to their own internal affairs and be 
sure about where they stand, instead of poking their noses into 
other people's business and making phony accusations. Their 
anxieties and misgivings are their own affair. They should try 
to cope with them, instead of resorting to the escapist policy 
that characterizes their crippled regime. 
  The policy of repeated claims and fabricated lies about our 
country, which the Iranian rulers handle so well, shows the 
major hatred and hostility harbored by that regime. It reflects 
their increasing fear of powerful Iraq, the only country that 
taught them a lesson, defeated their expansionist and aggressive 
policy, and exposed the fallacy of their resounding slogans.

Condoning the Killing of One's Own"] 
  [Text] Agents are too cheap to say no if the population of 
a part of their region comes into harm's way. Indeed, as 
servants doing the bidding of foreigners, they will stop at 
nothing to hurt and slander the worthy people guarding the 
homeland. 
  Sham patriots have overstepped the limits of decency in 
kowtowing to foreigners. While they knock at the doors of the 
West to antagonize it against their own people, as the agent 
Jalal Talabani is doing, they look away from what is going in 
the northern part of the autonomous region, where the Turkish 
military is waging war with heavy weapons and the most 
up-to-date F-15's and F-16's against Iraqi border villages. 
  The armed gang leaders remain tight-lipped as Turkish 
military forces cross the Iraqi border and engage in mass 
killings, with the full knowledge of those who have sold out to 
the foreigners. In the meantime, the Turks declare that their 
occupation of undesignated areas of our beloved north will last 
for months, until the end of summer. 
  We have no sympathy for some people being duped by 
foreigners. But we are saddened by the sight of the Kurdish 
parties and their collaborators sacrificing the fate of Kurds 
along the border with Turkey, in return for guarantees that 
Ankara's military forces will spare their own men. 
  In an unsavory transaction, agents are purchasing their 
survival with the blood of our Kurds, who are being slaughtered 
in the beloved north of our country.

<F P=106> ["Windows" column by Diya' Hasan: "Real Drop of the Dollar </F>
Has Begun"] 
  [Text] It is good that a drop in the dollar value has begun 
to be felt in the market. We hope this positive phenomenon is 
accompanied by a similar drop in the prices of the commodities 
citizens need, especially food. The price of food has soared, 
under the pretext of the high price of the dollar. 
  The drop in the dollar's value in these circumstances is a 
sign that Iraq can adjust its economic conditions in a way that 
will enable it to overcome all the negative plans aimed at Iraq 
by outsiders. They exploit the unjust siege imposed on it and 
work for a decline in the value of its currency. 
  Such a sign emphasizes anew that the present economic 
difficulties will pass. They can be overcome as soon as the 
siege is lifted. Iraq has capabilities and resources that give 
it the chance to restore the health of its national currency as 
a basis and supporter of new progress. 
  What adds optimism to the vision of the future is that 
despite the multiparty conspiracy against the Iraqi dinar, its 
real value is seen in ration cards. The Iraqi fil, which is no 
longer in circulation, has a declared value within citizens' 
monthly purchases of subsidized food. 
  If the fil has value in circumstances of pressure and 
aggressive plotting, then the dinar has greater value in such 
circumstances, and will have increasing value in the future. 
The dinar is based on resources under Iraq's land. This 
signals future prosperity coupled with calculated economic 
policies and an enlightened popular awareness about how to 
behave and how to invest money, according to priorities and 
without squandering. The dinar is in good shape, and the 
extraordinary situation will end.

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, 1 May (SPA) -- His Royal Highness Prince 
Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the interior minister, made a press 
statement following the graduation ceremony of the 23rd batch of 
university officers. After congratulating the new graduates, he 
said: "I hope they they will be at the level of our 
expectations, and be true security men and represent security in 
the Kingdom to the best of their abilities -- this security that 
stems first and foremost from our religion, and from our total 
respect for the citizen and the resident in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia." [passage omitted] 
  Regarding a question on preparations for marches like the 
Iranian march or for matters that go against the teachings of 
religions, the interior minister said: "In any case, I have 
heard such talk and read such reports. The Iranians have said 
that they will carry out such acts, and we say no, they will not 
be allowed to do so. Pilgrimage has its particular rites 
enjoyed by every Muslim. As for this matter, they know very well 
that it will not happen. They have been informed of this 
decision, and such acts will not be allowed to happen." 
  Responding to a question on reports carried by the Iranian 
media stating that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is trying to 
obstruct the march of the Iranian pilgrims; and how does his 
royal highness perceive the motives behind such campaigns, he 
said: "Are we really interested in words, or are we interested 
in reality? Let us talk about reality and see what is 
happening; it is reality that determines such matters." 
  Answering a question on the organizational aspect of 
pilgrims 
in the Kingdom, be they Saudis or residents, his royal highness 
indicated that the organization is always carried out by the 
Ministry of Pilgrimage and it always strives to organize these 
matters. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the General Committee of the </F>
General People's Congress on the first anniversary of the 27 
April 1993 Yemeni parliamentary elections; dated 26 April] 
  [Text] Today, Wednesday, is the first anniversary of the 
legendary legislative elections held by our great Yemeni people 
on 27 April 1993. On that day, they realized an unprecedented 
historic achievement. They accomplished the greatest and most 
fundamental democratic and strategic mission along the road to a 
united Yemen, and toward establishing the foundations of its 
shura-inspired and democratic system of government on the basis 
of political pluralism and a multiparty system, and in 
accordance with the principle of universal suffrage, and direct 
and secret balloting. This sought to consecrate the principle 
of popular participation, as well as the peaceful and democratic 
exchange of authority. 
  Our people have accomplished this great mission with 
matchless success, and in an honorable democratic competition, 
the fairness of which was attested to by all fraternal and 
friendly parties which closely watched the [words indistinct] 
elections. Thus, our people managed to occupy their special 
position among all peoples of the civilized community of nations 
in the course of efforts to build a democratic community on the 
basis of free choice, as well as peaceful and democratic 
competition. By so doing, our people demonstrated that there 
was no longer any room within their ranks for any form of 
tyranny, (?parochialism), or tribalism, which could rehabilitate 
the imamate regime, colonial rule, and the humiliating 
partitioning, particularly since the injustice and darkness of 
these worn-out totalitarian systems of government have been cast 
away by time, and brushed aside by the winds of change and 
transformation. 
  On this occasion, the General People's Congress [GPC] 
appeals 
to all Yemeni national forces [words indistinct] to reiterate 
their commitment to the democratic course being pursued by our 
people and our unified state. Since the inception of the 
Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990, the GPC has sought to 
epitomize this course in order to set a splendid example in 
terms of respect for and compliance with this course for other 
national parties and political organizations. It has been doing 
so by democratizing its action programs. 
  There is no denying that the GPC has encountered several 
difficulties along this road since the beginning of the 
transitional period on 22 May. Nonetheless, the GPC was careful 
not to allow these difficulties to become an excuse for 
abandoning this course, or for revoking its commitment to hold 
the elections in order to enable the people to cast their votes 
and to make their choices through the election of their 
representatives to the first elected legislative body. Given 
all this, the GPC has spared no effort to do all that could have 
been done to convince others of the need to promote the march of 
unity and democracy to help implement the constitution of a 
unified Yemen, which was approved in a national referendum, so 
that Yemen may establish its political system on the basis of 
the constitutional legitimacy gained through direct and free 
elections. 
  In this regard, there is no need to explain the efforts the 
GPC has made, or to detail the extensive dialogues and meetings 
it has held, or even to the moves it has made to safeguard the 
dignity of all sides, particularly [words indistinct] to 
reassure them, and help them overcome the fears they had about 
their future in the context of the political pluralism of united 
Yemen. The strongest evidence of this was the fact that the GPC 
leadership and bodies expressed a willingness to merge with the 
YSP so the two parties could share the same destiny and fate, 
not to mention that the GPC proposed other formulas for [words 
indistinct] alliance with the (?YSP). However, all these 
proposals have not, regrettably, met with any measure of 
favorable response or understanding. There is no doubt that our 
people are well aware that our partners in the unity deal 
actually agreed to take part in the elections only after the GPC 
had provided them with guarantees, made concessions to them, and 
demonstrated goodwill toward them. 
  When the elections were held under the close scrutiny and 
observation of Arabs and international agencies, those who 
supervised the election process had no doubts at all about the 
fairness and honesty of the elections. Although some 
undemocratic practices were committed by some people during 
their election campaigns and the balloting process, the overall 
election process earned the admiration and appreciation of the 
entire world community. 
  It never dawned on the GPC that its landslide victory in 
these elections would provoke the grudges of some parties, 
particularly in the aftermath of the emergence of the Yemeni 
Reform Grouping as a major political force in the country. 
  Out of a desire to ward off some of the consequences of this 
development, the GPC gave up some of its constitutional rights 
to safeguard and promote national unity. Consequently, it 
[words indistinct] with the YSP and the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
in a national government coalition that epitomized the spirit of 
sharing the burdens of national responsibilities. It also 
agreed that the prime minister of this coalition government 
would be a YSP official, and the speaker of the parliament 
[words indistinct]. Moreover, the GPC gave up a third seat it 
was entitled to hold on the Presidential Council [words 
indistinct) to be agreed upon and approved by the House of 
Representatives. Once the agreements regarding these amendments 
were signed, the GPC, just like other national forces and 
organizations, as well as all local, Arab, and international 
quarters, were surprised by the return of YSP Secretary General 
brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid from [words indistinct] homeland to 
the city of Aden. By his action, he refrained from taking the 
constitutional oath as vice president. He made this move to 
avoid assuming his duties within the Presidential Council. 
Since then, he has been in a new seclusion, the aim of which is 
to preclude the endorsement of these agreements, obstruct the 
work of state institutions, and flagrantly undermine the results 
of the elections held on 27 April, not to mention other serious 
practices and transgressions that are jeopardizing and 
prejudicing the unity of the homeland. 
  We should also recall the desperate and flagrant attempts 
being made by some renegade and separatist forces to 
misrepresent facts in order to cover up for their positions, 
which are diametrically opposed to the results of the general 
parliamentary elections. These forces are demonstrating 
indifference to and boastful disregard for the people's will, 
decisions, and unionist and democratic choices, which they made 
on two occasions: First when they headed for polling stations 
to vote in favor of the draft Constitution of unified Yemen, and 
then when they headed for polling stations to elect their 
representatives to their legislative branch of government. It 
is peculiar that some of these isolationist leaders have 
relished this crisis. They do not have any sense of shame, any 
conscientiousness, or any honorable [words indistinct] that 
could deter them from proceeding with their efforts to mislead 
the public, deceive citizens, and promote their false 
allegations, which aim to tarnish the image of the historic 
accomplishment made by our people on 27 April 1993. These 
forces also seek to obstruct the determined efforts of [words 
indistinct] our homeland to promote its unity and build its 
democratic political system of government, oblivious to the fact 
that these reckless attempts will always fail to undermine the 
people's awareness. Likewise, they will not make us budge a 
hairbreadth from our positions and democratic course, which we 
chose and adopted when the Republic of Yemen came into being on 
22 May 1990. 
  On the first anniversary of the general parliamentary 
elections, the GPC would like to extend its heartfelt 
congratulations to the masses of our Yemeni people, who forged 
the 27 April victory, in which the eternal [words indistinct] 
vindicated their democratic option, their will, and their strong 
and unswayable faith in the unity of the homeland. Similarly, 
the GPC would like to reiterate its firm commitment to 
respecting our people's constants with regard to unity and 
democracy. Likewise, it reiterates its adherence to its 
legitimate constitutional right to defend all the gains [words 
indistinct] of our masses. It announces once again its firm 
convictions that any solution to the current impasse in the 
country should not undermine any of the sacred historical 
national constants cherished by our people, chief among which 
are the following: Compliance with the Constitution of unified 
Yemen, the only text that enjoyed national consensus; the 
activation of the legitimate elected bodies, headed by the House 
of Representatives; the holding of meetings by the state's 
leading institutions so they may perform their duties; 
expediting the full implementation of the accord document; and 
ending once and for all military, political, and media 
repercussions of the crisis. 
  The GPC would like to reiterate that these constants are the 
only tenets that can safeguard our people's unity, democratic 
option, and eternal revolution. 
  May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you. 
  [Signed] The GPC 
  [Dated] 26 April 1994

<F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, </F>
speaker of the Yemeni House of Representatives and leader of the 
Yemeni Reform Grouping, by Hammud Munsir in Sanaa; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [Munsir] Although more than two months have 
elapsed since the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document, the 
crisis has seen nothing but further escalation and dispute, and 
the accord still has not been implemented. Why? 
  [Al-Ahmar] I believe that the brothers in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] are responsible for the continuation of 
the crisis, especially over the document. Because after the 
signing, all officials were supposed to return to their work in 
Sanaa, whether in the Presidential Council, the Council of 
Ministers, or any other institution, so that all bodies could 
perform their official duties, and in order to implement the 
document. But regrettably, they began to flee from Amman. 
  [Munsir] Would you call that a rebellion? 
  [Al-Ahmar] Undoubtedly the position of some YSP leaders has 
been considered a rebellion since the crisis began. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Munsir] Did your signing of the document mean the end of 
your reservations about it? 
  [Al-Ahmar] The reservations still stand but it does not mean 
that we reject the document as a whole. We have reservations 
about some points in it until an understanding is reached on 
them. 
  [Munsir] Can you specify some of these points? 
  [Al-Ahmar] They are known to and understood by everyone. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Munsir] Who is behind the military tension and clashes that 
took place in Abyan, Harf Sufyan, Shabwah, and Ma'rib? 
  [Al-Ahmar] When there is a crisis or a dispute between two 
forces, two parties, or even two states or tribes, complications 
are bound to emerge, whether through someone's actions or as a 
result of psychological tensions leading to that. 
  [Munsir] But it was noted that the clashes occurred after 
the document was signed and then escalated in an unprecedented 
manner. Do you believe forces opposed to the document were 
behind these military developments? 
  [Al-Ahmar] That is not ruled out. I believe that that 
action was designed to abort the signing of the document. On 
that day it was said that the YSP had sent military 
reinforcements from Aden to Abyan, violating the decisions of 
the dialogue committee, the Presidential Council, and the House 
of Representatives and the military committee's instructions. 
  [Munsir] The YSP persists in accusing what it terms the 
"influential military family in Sanaa" and influential forces or 
elements in the General People's Congress [GPC], and sometimes a 
third party -- apparently a reference to the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping [YRG] -- of being behind these attempts and explosions. 
What is your opinion? 
  [Al-Ahmar] These accusations are absolutely untrue. The YSP 
represents half of the authority, and it is now demanding that 
others implement the document, even though its implementation 
requires a unified political will. 
  [Munsir] The YSP moved a step ahead of you at the foreign 
level. Its leaders intensified their visits to most Arab 
states, especially in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. It 
was said at the time that the YSP was occupying your traditional 
positions at the regional level. How do you view and what is 
your position on these visits? 
  [Al-Ahmar] The visits the YSP paid to fraternal states, 
near and far, are illegitimate moves which prompted the people 
to see them as separatist moves aimed at separation. This is 
the people's interpretation and opinion. [passage omitted] 
  [Munsir] YSP leaders have said that there is a "political 
Islam" scheme or a "fundamentalist scheme" obstructing the 
national democratic unionist plan. Some people interpret this 
as a clear reference to the YRG. What truth is there in reports 
of the existence of extremist fundamentalist elements in Yemen? 
  [Al-Ahmar] I am surprised by the allegations of the YSP and 
those helping it to promote these lies. I am also surprised 
that the Egyptian brothers should listen to these lies and 
believe them, hence viewing us as they view Islamic groups in 
some Arab states. 
  We in Yemen are a Muslim people. We do not have religious or 
ethnic minorities among us. Since the dawn of history Yemen has 
been ruled by the Islamic Shari'ah, which is dominant and the 
basis on which Yemeni cases are settled, including political, 
commercial, and other cases. Thus there is nothing to prompt 
the Yemeni people or any religious group or element to resort to 
violence in order to demand what Islamic parties in Egypt or 
elsewhere are demanding -- the application of the Shari'ah. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Munsir] The YSP accused YRG militias of fighting alongside 
the al-'Amaliqah forces in the clashes that occurred in Abyan. 
What truth is there in these accusations? 
  [Al-Ahmar] The YRG has no militias. It is a phrase they 
level at any cadres or elements capable of carrying weapons and 
defending themselves. YRG "cadres" in Abyan defended themselves 
with their own arms. [passage omitted] 
  [Munsir] What have Arab mediations achieved so far with 
regard to achieving a solution to the crisis? 
  [Al-Ahmar] We in the YRG reject any Arab, foreign, or even 
Yemeni mediation that proposes any initiatives or solutions 
outside what is mentioned in the Pledge and Accord Document. We 
are working to reinforce and safeguard unity. [passage omitted] 
  [Munsir] There have been reports that delegations from 
hard-line movements, including the Muslim Brotherhood 
International Organization and the National Islamic Front led by 
Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, arrived in Sanaa recently, and that they 
met with YRG and GPC officials with a view to setting up an 
Islamic alliance in Sanaa to confront a "secular" south 
Yemen-Egyptian alliance. What truth is there in this? 
  [Al-Ahmar] That is a lie and absolutely untrue. No 
delegations from Arab or non-Arab Islamic organizations have 
arrived in Yemen. If a delegation visits us, we do not receive 
it secretly, because we do not consider that a conspiracy or 
something to be ashamed of. 
  We will warmly, publicly, and fraternally receive any 
Islamic 
delegation that visits us. It is an honor for us to be visited 
by an Islamic preacher from any Arab or Islamic state, because 
we in Yemen are a Muslim people. [passage omitted] 
  [Munsir] There have been numerous reports of the existence 
of camps in Yemen to train terrorists, and a committee has been 
formed recently to investigate the matter. What truth is there 
in this, and what does it mean to you as an Islamic party? 
  [Al-Ahmar] Before the committee comes back with its report, 
I say that that is untrue and merely a lie. There is nothing to 
prompt the Yemenis to resort to setting up camps to train people 
in the use of arms. All Yemenis carry and are trained in the 
use of arms, hence there is no need to set up secret camps.

  [Text] An official source at the Defense Ministry, 
commenting on the so-called statement of the military official 
at the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff command which 
was transmitted by Channel One in Sanaa on 28 April said: 
  The Defense Ministry affirms that this statement was not 
issued by it and did not represent its opinion and that the 
statement was totally incorrect and had tried to change the 
facts upside down. It had tried in vain to place responsibility 
for the explosion of the situation in 'Imran on whom it referred 
to as saboteurs and secessionist elements in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party. The official source declined to answer this 
statement but the reality has already been made clear by the 
official source of the Defense Ministry last Wednesday [27 
April]. This fact is well-known by those who were burned by the 
fire of this sedition which was sparked off by the adventurous 
military command in Sanaa, the people of 'Imran and the members 
of the military commission who were present then at 'Imran Camp. 
  The statement added that the endeavors by the president and 
other officials in Sanaa to contain the position was totally not 
based on reality and that the appeals made by the defense 
minister to stop the military offensive against the 3d Armored 
Brigade had not been seriously dealt with. 
  The official source said that the ruling military circle in 
Sanaa had launched considerable forces equipped with various 
arms to attack the 3d Brigade without giving regard to the 
members of this brigade and the peaceful people of 'Imran. It 
also did not allow the evacuation of the wounded and did not 
treat them as prisoners of war but tortured them and 
interrogated them by the security bodies. 
  The source appealed to the public opinion, the military 
commission, and the fact-finding commission which was formed by 
the House of Deputies and human rights organizations to 
interfere in this inhuman conduct which contradicts with the 
morals of our Yemeni people.

  [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, April 29 (AFP) -- The danger of 
further bloody clashes between rival Yemeni troops eased Friday 
[29 April] after a southern armoured brigade retreated to the 
mountains around 'Imran north of Sanaa, scene of fierce tank 
battles which left more than 100 dead. 
  Military officials of the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party 
(YSP) said the 1,200 troops pulled out after reinforcements of 
northern troops, including elite Republican Guards, arrived at 
'Imran, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Sanaa. 
  Yemeni journalists who visited the scene said the northern 
troops gained the upper hand in the fighting which began on 
Wednesday, and the southern forces sought refuge with an allied 
tribe, the Bakil. 
  YSP officials described the southern forces' retreat as a 
"brilliant tactical manoeuvre," which avoided unnecessary 
casualties. 
  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih blamed south Yemeni 
"secessionists" for the fighting, which also left 200 people 
injured, and warned them to halt the provocations. 
  The official SABA' news agency said Salih, visiting northern 
troops wounded in the clashes, appealed to the southerners "to 
see reason and to adopt peaceful dialogue as a means of 
resolving differences." 
  A pro-YSP newspaper, October 14, said Friday northern troops 
based in the south were reinforcing their positions. 
  "The (northern) al-'Amaliqah brigade is stocking up with 
weapons and ammunition in order to tighten its grip on Abyan 
province and a key point commanding eastern the gateway to 
Aden," the paper said. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Sanaa, April 29 (AFP) -- The authorities in 
northern Yemen Friday accused southern troops of leaving a camp 
south of Sanaa and escalating tension following fierce tank 
battles which left more than 100 dead. 
  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's General People's Congress 
(GPC) said a southern brigade had deployed in the Dhamar region, 
100 kilometres (60 miles) south of Sanaa, on the orders of the 
GPC's southern rival, the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP). 
  The GPC said it feared "more widespread clashes" between 
rival northern and southern forces. 
  A military mediation committee was trying to "persuade the 
commanders of the Ba'Sahib brigade to return to their camp and 
eliminate military tension in the Dhamar region," the GPC said. 
  On April 6 the GPC accused the same brigade of shelling 
official buildings, including Republican Guard and police 
headquarters, in the Dhamar region. 
  YSP military officials said Friday a southern armoured 
brigade had retreated to the mountains around 'Imran north of 
Sanaa, following the latest fighting. 
  The officials said the 1,200 troops pulled out after 
reinforcements of northern troops, including elite Republican 
Guards, arrived at 'Imran, 60 kilometres (37 miles) north of 
Sanaa. 
  Yemeni journalists who visited the scene said the northern 
troops gained the upper hand in the fighting, and the southern 
forces sought refuge with an allied tribe, the Bakil. 
  The GPC said searches were under way for Colonel Sayf 
al-Baqri, commander of the southern armoured brigade held 
responsible for the bloody clashes in 'Imran. [passage omitted]

  [Text] This morning the criminal acts perpetrated by units 
of the Presidential Guard, central security, and gangs of tribes 
loyal to the ruling military family in Sanaa have been renewed 
against units of the 3d Armored Brigade which had succeeded on 
the afternoon of 27 April in absorbing the first treacherous 
offensive strike, deploying to thwart the attacks and moving to 
defensive positions. This enabled the brigade to stay steadfast, 
thanks to God's support, the high morale and fighting spirit of 
the men of the brigade, as well as the experience of its 
command, the support of the patriotic tribes and the inhabitants 
of 'Imran against whom strikes by forces of the adventurist 
military family were also directed. 
  Units of the 3d Armored Brigade are continuing courageously 
and with responsible steadfastness to resist the forces of 
treachery and treason [words indistinct].

  [Text] Units of the 3d Armored Brigad continue to 
courageously and steadfastly resist the forces of treachery and 
treason -- the murderous and (?terroristic) gang raised under 
the protection of the ruling authority in Sanaa. Brigade 
soldiers, together with the inhabitants of 'Imran, taught the 
adventurist gang a serious lesson. They proved that the people's 
resolve was invincible, and that the person who plays with fire 
will be the first one burned. This gang, which brags of 
imaginary victories achieved through its hired mercenaries, is 
ashamed to tell the truth, which is known by the sons of valiant 
'Imran, who saw how the 3d Armored Brigade confronted the forces 
of defeatism and made them taste their evil in broad daylight. 
While we are saddened and regret the human and material losses 
suffered by the two sides, at the same time we hold those hired 
commanders of the ruling gang in Sanaa responsible, before our 
people and their armed forces, and before local, Arab and world 
public opinion, for the crimes they have perpetrated, as well as 
for any conflagration -- in which the greatest losers will be 
the Yemeni people, who have been patient for a long time. 
However, there are limits to patience. The Defense Ministry, 
which strove and is striving to prevent the situation from 
exploding, renews its appeal for an end to all criminal acts of 
combat against the units of the 3d Armored Brigade and innocent 
citizens, and for an end to the siege against these units as 
well, which would guarantee an evacuation of the wounded and the 
delivery of supplies. 
  In this context, we call on international bodies and 
organizations, particularly those concerned with defending human 
rights, including the Yemeni Red Crescent, the Arab Red Crescent 
organizations and the International Red Cross, to carry out 
their humanitarian duties towards our brothers and sons in the 
3d Armored Brigade, who are in danger of being annihilated by 
the ruling gang and its myrmidons. 
  The Defense Ministry again warns against the consequences of 
continuing to play with fire and fanning the flames of a 
crushing civil war throughout the homeland. We are confident 
that our people and their Armed Forces, and all the honorable 
nationalist forces for whom the homeland and its sons are dear, 
will not stand aside as onlookers in the face of the danger that 
threatens the homeland and its unity.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah, Lutfi Shatarah, Hammud </F>
Munsir, and Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Southern Forces Prepare To 
Launch Revenge Attack After 100 People Are Killed in 'Imran 
Fighting"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Sanaa, Damascus -- Military 
confrontations between northern and southern forces in Yemen 
entered a serious stage yesterday after more than 100 people 
were killed from the two sides, among them 20 civilians, and 200 
wounded, and after forces moved from northern and southern camps 
and set up posts in the areas adjacent to their camps. A state 
of maximum alert has been announced among southern forces in 
Aden, including the air force, in what has been described as 
preparation for launching a revenge attack within 24 hours. 
  The security situation has become more serious following the 
attempt in Sanaa to assassinate Dr. Hasan Makki, first deputy 
prime minister and member of the General People Congress [GPC] 
General Secretariat (political bureau). [passage omitted] 
  At the military level, Yemeni sources said that the 
continuing tank battles between northern and southern forces in 
'Imran, north of the capital, Sanaa, presage an expansion of the 
fighting to all Yemeni governorates, especially as military 
reports confirmed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that the forces 
present in all northern and southern camps in the former fringes 
area have moved from their barracks and set up posts in the 
areas adjacent to their camps. 
  Authoritative sources in Aden have said that all camps in 
the 
city, including the air force, are on maximum alert. 
  The sources expect southern forces to launch a revenge 
attack 
within the coming 24 hours on northern forces in some southern 
governorates. The sources accused Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih of "wanting to eliminate the southern brigades 
stationed in the north. So it is difficult to return the 
northern forces based in the south peacefully." [passage 
omitted] 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday former South 
Yemen President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad urged the political 
leadership and conflicting Yemeni parties to take steps to 
quickly contain the crisis and stop the explosion which could 
lead to disastrous consequences. He said: The political 
leadership must stop evading the crushing crisis Yemen is 
experiencing. 
  He also said: The fighting that broke out among comrades in 
arms is unjustifiable, because there can be no victors in this 
fighting. 
  President 'Ali Nasir appealed to the Armed Forces "not to 
aim 
their weapons against one another, in order to spare blood and 
keep the Armed Forces strong and coherent so they can protect 
and safeguard the homeland." He urged all parties to adhere to 
the Pledge and Accord Document. 
  Former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad stressed that the 
solution to this crisis should be Yemeni and that others' task 
should be to help only. President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad revealed 
an initiative he submitted recently to President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, saying that this 
initiative can form a prelude to a dialogue and breakthrough in 
the Yemeni situation. 
  The former president praised Arab efforts, especially those 
being made by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and some other 
Arab brothers. He said: Everyone in Yemen is responsible for 
this conflict; no one can be cleared. And they must rescue 
Yemen and the Yemeni people.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Yemeni Socialist Party Political </F>
Bureau in Aden on 29 April] 
  [Text] The political bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] held a meeting on 29 April under the chairmanship of 
Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the secretary general of the YSP 
Central Committee and deputy chairman of the Presidential 
Council. The meeting considered new developments in Yemen in 
the wake of the deplorable military incidents which occurred 
between the 1st Brigade and the 3d Brigade in 'Imran on 27 April. 
  The political bureau pointed out, in light of the 
information 
and data available to it, that the battles in 'Imran began with 
an organized, planned, and premeditated attack by 1st Armored 
Brigade forces from the 1st Armored Division. The attack was 
supported by Republican Guard forces, central security troops, 
and some tribal groups. The 3d Brigade was compelled to respond 
to the treacherous attack. These deplorable, bloody battles led 
to heavy material and human losses in all units engaged in the 
fighting. The victims were innocent soldiers, sons of the one 
Yemen, men from the same Yemeni Armed Forces. What made the 
situation more atrocious was the unethical and unpatriotic 
conduct towards the wounded on the part of the 3d Brigade. The 
wounded troops were forced into cells and interrogated -- many 
were tortured while they were still bleeding. These stupid acts 
affected some members of the military commission, in particular 
the detention and provocation of our brother Colonel 'Ali Naji 
Ubayd, a member of the military commission and director of the 
defense minister's office, who was in 'Imran as part of a 
military commission that was attempting to calm the situation 
before it exploded. 
  He, along with his brother members from the military 
commission, have made tireless and mighty efforts to preserve 
and secure the Armed Forces and indeed, the entire homeland, 
against disastrous internecine warfare and destruction. The 
matter did not end there. The positions of the 1st Brigade were 
strengthened with new brigades from the Republican Guards and 
the 1st Division, with the aim of continuing the attack and 
besieging 3d Brigade positions. At the same time there were 
intensive troop concentrations and reinforcements sent to 
confront the Ba Suhayb Brigade, the 1st Artillery Brigade at 
Yarim, and the 14th Brigade at al-Qama. They were also 
positioned opposite al-Bayda, Mukayras, Ma'rib and Shabwah. 
  The political bureau linked the events at 'Imran, the 
concentration of troops, and the new military reinforcements, to 
events like the incidents at Abyan and Harf Sufyan, the 
aggression against the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar, and the 
threats and assassinations of members of the YSP in the northern 
governorates. The movements of these party members were 
monitored and their names written down on lists that were 
prepared as a prelude to the assassinations. There were 
attempts to close the headquarters of the party, such as that 
witnessed in the Governorate of Hajjah. 
  The political bureau also linked this series of military 
activities to the stupid, hysterical, propagandist, and 
patched-up media campaigns waged by the media of the General 
People's Congress and the Yemeni Alliance for Reform, against 
the YSP and other patriotic parties. 
  These campaigns climaxed in a speech by the chairman of the 
Presidential Council and the secretary general of the General 
People's Congress on 27 April. The political bureau said the 
president's speech was tantamount to a declaration of war. 
Worse still, it was clear political and media preparation (?to 
justify) the military attack against the 3d Brigade in 'Imran, 
which occurred a few hours after the speech. The president's 
speech blasted all the (?objectives) and concepts [word 
indistinct] of national consensus, as well as the pledge and 
accord document. It was characterized fabrications [word 
indistinct] and abuse against the YSP, the other patriotic 
parties, and the dialogue commission. The speech also contained 
repugnant words and expressions which reason cannot countenance 
as emanating directly from the president. 
  The political bureau stressed that the series of military 
incidents and the escalation of media and political campaigns 
were integral components of the same scenario [preceding word in 
English] and design whose fundamental objective was to abort the 
pledge and accord document, paralyze national unanimity, and 
abort the activities of the dialogue commission, the military 
commission, and the meetings of the Council of Ministers, 
besides hindering all internal patriotic efforts. These 
incidents are also intended to hinder Arab and international 
efforts to tackle the crisis on nationalistic and democratic 
grounds, and on the grounds created by the pledge and accord 
document. 
  This design also aims to kill democracy in its cradle, 
harming national unity and adopting the methods of political 
annexation [ilhaq] and hegemony, while entrenching autocracy and 
oligarchy at the expense of the higher interests of the people 
and the homeland. It also aims to kindle the flames of civil 
strife, and finally to drive the country towards a destructive 
and [word indistinct] civil war which will destroy everything, 
and threaten the homeland's unity and the people's gains and 
achievements. 
  The YSP began as a unionist party from the inception of its 
factions in the early 50's, and admirably fought the battles of 
the national and social struggle for liberation and unity 
against the rule of the imamate and colonialism. It gave up 
many martyrs for the cause of the Yemeni revolutions of 
September and October. It was behind the raising of the banner 
of unity, and was at the vanguard to achieve unity on 22 May, 
1990. It proposed democratic dialogue from the beginning as a 
fundamental course for the development of Yemen's social 
political system. The party espoused the slogan of reform, and 
was the first to call for national dialogue [word indistinct] 
with the other parties to conclude the pledge and accord 
document. The party's glorious achievements and great 
historical record truly outweigh these rabid attempts, which 
vainly attempt to damage its history and patriotic symbols, and 
to distort its national and social objectives. The YSP can only 
stand with the people. It will pursue no other path except that 
of unity, democracy and national consensus. 
  That was how it lived in the past with the people, that is 
how it is at the present -- it will not be otherwise in the 
future. Those who are swimming against the current of the times 
and who are inclined to think of and return to the past, are the 
same ones who pride themselves on past struggles and on an 
honorable and brilliant past. But they are the same ones who 
[words indistinct] the use of the pistol and terrorism [words 
indistinct]. They are the same ones who still talk about the 
interests of the homeland and the people from the very narrow 
corner of their tribal and (?clannish) interests. 
  The YSP political bureau condemns all military acts of 
aggression, and calls for stopping this deterioration 
immediately. It also wishes to confirm the importance of the 
following essential issues: 
  1. Stopping the deterioration of the situation and the 
military build-up, because of the danger this poses to the 
people and the homeland; releasing the men of the 3d Brigade and 
stopping reinforcements and the military build-up against the 3d 
Brigade, the 14th Brigade, and the Ba Suhyab Brigade; 
(?removing) the military reinforcements confronting al-Bayda, 
Abyan, Shabwah, and Ma'rib. There should be an immediate 
investigation into the 'Imran events and other military 
incidents preceding it. The results of that investigation 
should be made public. Theos sides which are shown to be linked 
to increasing tensions and engaging in military incidents should 
be called to account. There should be a swift end to the 
clashes between the brigades. 
  2. Swiftly implementing the pledge and accord document and 
commencing upon those tasks connected with military security 
aspects, due to their importance in preventing war. There 
should be planning and preparation for a secure atmosphere in 
which to implement the document. The brigades should withdraw 
all the Armed Forces from the places which used to be called 
border areas [atraf] and particularly from the governorates of 
Ta'izz, Laj, Ibb, Abyan, Shabwah, al-Bayda and Ma'rib. Forces 
should be withdrawn from towns, above all from Sanaa and Aden, 
and the terrorist camps should be closed down. Military and 
security forces should be redeployed and (?restationed), in 
accordance with the stipulations of the pledge and accord 
document. 
  3. The dialogue commission should draw up and publish a 
timetable for implementing every task in the document. The 
commission should assume responsibility for following up and 
supervising these efforts. The commission should make public 
the implementation's outcome at every step. It should publicly 
condemn any side which behaves in a dilatory manner in the 
implementation of the document. The dialogue commission ought 
to fully undertake the role set out for it in the document. The 
party rejects any attempt to marginalize the role of the 
dialogue commission. The political bureau calls for the return 
of the two brothers, Sinan Abu-Luhum and Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, 
to exercise their tasks in the dialogue commission, as they have 
a history of patriotism and prominent contribution to the 
national dialogue within the framework of the dialogue 
commission. 
  4. The dialogue commission should be vested with 
responsibility for supervising the management of the news media, 
and should be given the right to suspend any media programs or 
activities which contradict the spirit of the pledge and accord 
document, or which contribute to deepening the crisis and 
inciting civil strife. 
  5. The political bureau calls on all patriotic parties and 
social organizations, as well as all groups of people such as 
workers, merchants, peasants, tribesmen and owners of national 
capital, in addition to intellectuals, religious men, students, 
and the security and armed forces, to rally their ranks to 
contribute positively and effectively to preserving the union 
and democracy, to reject war and internecine fighting, and to 
demand the implementation of the pledge and accord document. 
The party supports holding public sit-ins as a peaceful, 
democratic and cultural approach for expressing the opinion of 
the masses. It rejects any attempt to sabotage or hire the 
masses to serve selfish or narrow group interests. Sparking off 
war should be prevented. The implementation of the consensus of 
national unanimity will be linked to the effectiveness of the 
time-honored, patriotic and public accord. 
  6. The political bureau expresses appreciation for the role 
of brothers and friends in containing the current crisis and 
their assistance in tackling it with peace and democracy. 
  The political bureau welcomes the continuation of these 
efforts to ensure concerted internal and external efforts 
towards overcoming the crisis, preserving unity and democracy 
and implementing the pledge and accord document so as to ensure 
security and stability in Yemen and in the region generally.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Yemeni Socialist Party Political </F>
Bureau; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The political bureau has been following with great 
concern the insistence by influential military forces in Sanaa 
of continuing the military crime in 'Imran, and in all of Yemen, 
to escalate military tension. These influential forces, up to 
the issuance of this statement, continue to amass large forces 
to besiege and strike at the 3d Armored Brigade and heroic 
citizens from among the sons of the people of Jabal Iyal, Yazid, 
Iyal Sarih, Sufyan, Arhab, Bani Abd, and other honorable 
citizens. 
  The 3d Armored Battalion moved to new positions in the Sanaa 
Governorate, and was subjected to barbarous and treacherous 
aggression by the 1st Armored Brigade, Republican Guard forces, 
and central security and tribal forces, which were transported 
to 'Imran from other areas a few hours before the military 
conflict, which was led by such warmongers as Humud Atif and Ali 
Hamid Qulaydan. These forces were not satisfied with imposing 
an intensive siege on the new positions to which the 3d Armored 
Brigade had moved, but prevented the passage of food and medical 
supplies, as well as the transport of the dead and wounded to 
the hospitals. Indeed, they went further in their violations of 
human rights and the genuine ideals and norms of our Yemen 
people by throwing the wounded into prison and subjecting them 
to torture. They were treated as if they were POW's from a 
foreign army -- not the sons of the same homeland. This 
irresponsible stance by the ruling military family reached its 
peak when it left the wounded to die on the battlefields. 
  The military family provided aid only for certain wounded 
persons -- this is the expression of an abominable secessionist 
trend. More atrocious than this was that the representatives of 
the ruling military family supervised the dragging of the 
wounded as POW's to central security cells, where they were 
tortured while interrogated. This is a cheap game they play for 
the media, without any conscience or moral restraint. 
  There is no doubt that giving orders to strike at the 3d 
Brigade was tantamount to a declaration of civil war, which was 
issued by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, frankly and clearly, 
on 27 April, prior to the military conflict in 'Imran. This was 
the same day that aggression was committed against the 3d 
Armored Brigade in 'Imran, as part of a military and political 
plan by the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Alliance for 
Reform, and the ruling military family. The aggression was 
committed two hours after the war declaration was delivered by 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the secretary general of the 
General People's Congress. It is now clear that the plan is 
aimed at emptying the northern governorates of the brigades 
which moved there after the declared union of north and south 
Yemen, and at their bloody liquidation by dealing with them one 
at a time in a gradual manner. This has been done by contriving 
many different, flimsy justifications as a prelude to engagement 
in an overall war, a war planned by fundamentalist forces in the 
General People's Congress and the Yemeni Alliance for Reform, in 
addition to external fundamentalist forces, and with the support 
of the ruling military family in Sanaa. 
  It is now confirmed that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is 
the one who is personally commanding this grave military action 
from the operations room. It is he who is issuing directives to 
pursue the 3d Brigade and liquidate it, after having given 
orders for striking and annihilating it. He has been leaking 
misleading information to the international news media about the 
annihilation of the 3d Brigade during the incident, to cover his 
pursuit of the heroes of the brigade as they moved to to new 
positions. It is he who is personally supervising ongoing 
preparations to strike the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar, as well 
as the build-up of reinforcements around it, and the besieging 
of that brigade by Republican Guard and central security 
brigades, along with the assistance from battalions from the 
Majd Brigade, which was moved from Bajil in the Hudaydah 
Governorate. 
  The 3d Brigade faced with rare heroism the atrocious 
conspiracy and the loathsome crime to which it was subjected. 
It managed to withdraw outside its camp after its stores and 
ammunitions, as well as a part of its forces, had been 
destroyed. Had President Ali Salih been a unionist and 
responsible for all the people, in accordance with the oath he 
took before the House of Deputies, in the name of God Almighty, 
to bear his responsibility with honesty -- had the president 
been so, it was in his power, while commanding and directing the 
battle personally, to work for the preservation of what was left 
of the 1st and 3d Brigades. However, he gave orders for the 
pursuit of the 3d Brigade, with the aim of annihilating it. He 
pushed two brigades from the Republican Guards and central 
security forces, under the command of his brothers, in addition 
to other warmongers such as Sheikh Humud Atif and Sheikh Ali 
Hamid Qulaydan, to pursue the brigade after it was cut off from 
food supplies, fuel and water. 
  We appeal to public opinion; human rights organizations; the 
Yemeni, Arab and International Red Cross and Red Crescent 
Societies; and to all those with living human consciences to 
provide essential and urgent assistance to save the wounded, 
remove the dead, and stop the horrific actions to which the 
wounded are being subjected in the prisons of the ruling 
military family. 
  This crime indicates that those who are managing and 
implementing this operation, bit by bit, do not care about 
sacrificing everyone to stay in power. This confirms what 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said in Amman, that he was ready 
to wage war and sacrifice 30,000 soldiers to liquidate the YSP. 
What is being prepared and planned now must be regarded as part 
of a bloody and horrible venture, which is likely to inflict 
great harm on the unity of the homeland, its security, and 
stability. Indications of the start of the implementation of 
this reckless venture appeared in a political statement issued 
personally by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in a speech he 
delivered in the Sab'in ground on 27 April. It included attacks 
which were inappropriate from a head of state against a party 
which is his partner in power, and against opposition parties 
and the dialogue commission which [word indistinct] that great 
historical and national achievement reflected in the pledge and 
accord document. 
  The president was not satisfied with that only, but was keen 
to include in his speech an open call to spark off a civil war, 
and issue a fatwa for a jihad, similar to the fatwas issued by 
heads of terrorist organizations to justify their acts of murder 
and assissinations. The speech called on every individual to 
make himself a judge, a prosecutor general, and the president of 
a court. This indicates a desire to undermine the constitutional 
and legal foundations of the unified state and open the door to 
anarchy, terrorism, and civil war as an excuse for secession. 
  The YSP, as it is part of the masses of our people and its 
political parties and its vital forces, expresses its deep 
concern over the insistence of the ruling military family in 
Sanaa to spark off of a civil war in Yemen. It holds 
responsible those adventurist forces. President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih must bear full and personal responsibility for what has 
happened, and continues to happen with regard to the shedding of 
the blood of the Yemeni Armed Forces and the threatening of the 
unity of the homeland, since orders were issued to part of the 
Yemeni Army to strike at another part of the same army. This is 
unethical and unpatriotic, and we cannot remain silent about it. 
It is difficult for the people to understand the legitimacy 
about which General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was talking. It is 
also difficult for all of us to understand the unity which they 
speak about so flippantly, while they direct their treacherous 
artillery against it. 
  The statement, leaked to the news media by the ruling 
military family and its puppets concerning the pursuit of the 
commander of the 3d Armored Brigade, the heroic Colonel (Sayf 
al- Bakri) and the militant brother Yahya Dahis, is a 
disgraceful act indicating the bankruptcy of its authors. It is 
an attempt to get a cover for the justification of the 
massacres. The adventurers in Sanaa are planning to continue 
the attack on the 3d Armored Brigade at its new positions north 
of Sanaa. Those who issued these orders should be ashamed of 
themselves. The commander of the brigade, accused by the ruling 
family of having given orders to the 3d Brigade, was taking his 
lunch in a mess with members of the joint military commission in 
the presence of the U.S. and French military attaches and a 
number of officers of the brigade. Brother Yahya Dahis was not 
even present at the camp. The commander of the brigade was 
surprised by the explosion inside the camp, as was the joint 
military commission. 
  We can say with all confidence that those who should be put 
on trial are the adventurers who issued orders to start the 
implementation of the extermination plan and above all the civil 
war. The criminal and engineer of terror, murder and 
assassination, is Col. Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, who began the 
implementation of the first phase of this war when he struck the 
unarmed 5th Brigade at Harf Sufyan. He then continued his war 
against the 3d Brigade. 
  He may continue it in a different phase tomorrow and in a 
different place in the northern governorates and face units 
moving towards southern governorates. 
  The attack against the 3d Brigade is a detestable crime 
which 
will not pass away easily and the insistence on besieging and 
pursuit of this brigade, aimed at annihilating it, will also not 
pass away easily. Because that means the launching of total 
civil war, whose responsibility and aftermath will rest on those 
adventurous secessionists. The spokesman stressed that true 
unity is the unity being manifested today in its various 
aspects, insofar as the heroes of the 3d Armored Brigade are 
joining together with hundreds of thousands of the heroes of the 
al-Sanadid tribe in the areas to which the brigade's positions 
have been moved, and where it was welcomed in a brotherly, 
nationalistic and unionist manner. Those heroes who are coming 
together today as one are the true unionists, while those 
adventurists implementing the plot to detonate civil war in 
Yemen [words indistinct] are the true secessionists.

  [Text] Within the framework of contacts being made to 
contain the situation set off by influential [mutanaffidah] 
military forces in the General People's Congress on 27 April in 
the area of 'Imran, brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, deputy chairman 
of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] Central Committee, continued contacts with 
a number of his brother kings and presidents of Arab states. 
This evening he spoke on the telephone with the custodian of 
the two holy places, His Majesty King Fahd Bin 'Abd-al-'Aziz al 
Sa'ud, the king of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, His Excellency 
President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, the president of the Arab 
Republic of Egypt, and His Excellency Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the 1st of September Revolution. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid briefed the kings and presidents 
on 
the latest developments in the Yemeni arena, in light of the 
massing of troops and reinforcements by these forces, and the 
pursuit of soldiers of the 3d Armored Brigade in the mountains 
and areas close to 'Imran, as well as the treatment of the 
brigade's wounded as POW's in their own homeland. 
  He clarified that these forces are pushing the country into 
the inferno of a destructive civil war. He asked his brothers 
the kings and presidents to attempt to prevent this from 
happening, and to lessen the impact of the pschological and 
physical pressures from which the wounded are suffering.

  [Text] Aden, 30 Apr (MENA) -- A spokesman for the Political 
Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has accused the 
military forces in Sanaa of continuing their buildup to besiege 
and attack the 3d Armored Brigade in the new positions it 
assumed after the attack against it in 'Imran. 
  In a statement this evening, the spokesman said the 
aggression against the 3d Brigade in 'Imran was part of a 
military and political plan worked out by the General People's 
Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Reform Grouping. The attack was 
launched after the "war speech" delivered by President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih on 27 April, he said. 
  The spokesman said President Salih is issuing instructions 
to 
chase and liquidate the 3d Armored Brigade and to send 
reinforcements from the Republican Guards and the Central 
Security forces. These forces, the spokesman added, are 
assisted by battalions from the al-Majd Brigade moved from Babil 
al-Jadidah [name as received]. 
  The spokesman said in his statement that the military forces 
in Yemen left the wounded from the 3d Brigade without medical 
treatment and sent them to jails. They are being treated as 
prisoners of war from a foreign army, not as the sons of the 
unified homeland. The spokesman urged Red Cross and Red 
Crescent societies and human rights organizations to extend the 
necessary assistance to those soldiers and to save them from 
torture. 
  The spokesman said the schemes currently being designed are 
part of a horrible bloody adventure that will deeply hurt 
Yemen's unity and security. 
  Attacking and chasing the 3d Brigade, the spokesman said, is 
a crime that will not pass easily because it means declaring an 
all- out civil war for which the separatists will be responsible. 
  Meanwhile, informed military sources in Aden have stressed 
that the military forces in Yemen continue to reinforce the 
Republican Guards, the Central Security, and the forces led by 
brothers and aides of President Salih in many governorates to 
escalate the military and political situation. 
  The sources said military reinforcements continued in the 
Governorate of Ta'izz toward al-Rahidah and Jabal Bani Shu'ayb, 
and the 3d Brigade was equipped to move toward the former border 
between the two parts of Yemen. 
  The sources added that the Republican Guards forces and the 
Central Security units in Dhamar were reinforced by two infantry 
battalions from al-Majd Brigade to besiege the southern Basuhayb 
brigade. President Salih and "his military family" are trying 
to push the biggest force possible toward the oil-rich 
Governorate of Shabwah, the sources added.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Defense Ministry on 30 April; place not </F>
given] 
  [Text] A responsible source in the Defense Ministry has 
renewed its appeal to the joint military commission and 
fact-finding committee, set up by the House of Representatives, 
to urgently mediate with the ruling military authority in Sanaa 
so as to save the wounded members of the 3d Armored Brigade. The 
source has also appealed for a guarantee that medical help and 
food supplies reach units of the brigade and the tribes of 
al-Sarih and al-Jabal, which have been subjected to continuous 
artillery bombardment by Republican Guard forces, central 
security forces, the military police, and tribes loyal to the 
ruling family in Sanaa. This came after the Defense Ministry 
received firm evidence showing that a number of wounded members 
of the 3d Brigade had been captured or removed from hospitals, 
shackled, and moved to national security centers and military 
garrisons, while being treated in a most inhumane and immoral 
way. 
  They were interrogated with the aim of extracting fantastic 
confessions from them in front of television, for cheap 
propaganda and political ends. Information has confirmed that 
many of these wounded persons are in terribly bad shape, that 
their lives are in danger as a result of torture (?in addition 
to) their wounds. What confirms these inhuman actions on the 
part of the military ruling authorities in Sanaa, which are 
being committed without any moral, patriotic or religious 
feelings, is the fact that on 30 April these authorities 
arrested Lieutenant Colonel 'Abd-al-Nabi Hadi al-Mahdi, the 
commander of the 14th Battalion of the 3d Armored Brigade. He 
was lying in bed at Amran Hospital, having been wounded on 27 
April in 'Imran by Sheikh Hamud Atif and his gang, on the orders 
of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who ordered the battalion 
commander to be brought to his office dead or alive. 
  The Defense Ministry source appealed to all patriotic 
forces, 
social personalities, parties, institutions, and humanitarian 
organizations -- particularly the Yemeni Red Crescent, Arab Red 
Crescent, and the International Red Cross, to discharge their 
humanitarian responsibilities toward our sons and brothers, who 
are being subjected to the most revolting physical and mental 
torture at the hands of the torturers and (?intelligence men) of 
the ruling military family in Sanaa, by guaranteeing the 
dispatch of medical and food aid to the 3d Armored Brigade and 
the sons of the al-Sarih and al-Jabal. 
  Issued by the Defense Ministry 
  [Dated] 30 April [words indistinct].

  [Text] Sanaa, April 30 (AFP) -- Rival troops clashed again 
north of Sanaa Saturday [30 April], pushing formerly divided 
north and south Yemen closer to civil war as both sides sought 
help from Arab states to resolve the conflict. 
  A southern military spokesman in Aden said elite northern 
Republican Guards "resumed criminal actions against elements of 
the (southern) third armoured brigade," deployed in the 'Imran 
region, 60 kilometers (36 miles) north of Sanaa. 
  The northern troops wanted to dislodge the brigade from 
positions it had occupied since ferocious tank battles Wednesday 
and Thursday that left nearly 200 dead and dozens of others 
wounded, according to journalists. 
  The defence ministry in Sanaa said 79 people were killed and 
119 wounded in the 'Imran fighting, while an unknown number of 
others had fled or disappeared. 
  A ministry spokesman quoted by the official news agency 
SABA' 
blamed "rebel elements in the (southern) Yemen Socialist Party" 
for the clashes, saying they were part of a plan "aimed at the 
partition of Yemen." 
  He said 159 homes were damaged in the fighting. 
  The clashes were the heaviest since former North and South 
Yemen were unified in May 1990. 
  In the latest fighting the northern forces were backed by 
tribesmen "hired by Sanaa," according to the southern spokesman. 
  The Bakil tribe has traditionally supported the south, while 
the Hashid has backed the north. Both are well equipped and can 
together raise forces of about 100,000 men. 
  The armies of north and south, each totalling about 30,000, 
have never merged since unification. 
  The southern troops were "still resisting the attacks," the 
southern spokesman said, and were backed by local people and 
"patriotic tribesmen." Yemen's political crisis erupted in 
August, when Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, 
refused to take up his duties in Sanaa, demanding major economic 
and military reforms. 
  Yemeni political observers said the chances for 
reconciliation between al-Bid and his rival, President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, were diminishing as each side accused the other 
of separatism. 
  Al-Bid urged Arab countries to intervene to prevent the 
conflict escalating Saturday. 
  In a telephone conversation with Libyan leader Mu'ammar al 
Qadhdhafi, quoted by the Libyan news agency JANA, al-Bid said he 
was "worried about the deteriorating situation" in Yemen. 
  "The Arab nation should intervene to save Yemen from civil 
war and fratricidal massacres," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Yemen's Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani 
arrived in Riyadh with a message for King Fahd from Salih on the 
situation in Yemen and a bilateral border dispute. 
  The Saudi-Yemeni disagreement centres on the provinces of 
Assir, Najran and Jizan, which were handed to Saudi Arabia under 
an agreement signed in 1934. 
  Yemen, which claims the provinces, says the accord expired 
in 
1992. 
  Saudi-Yemeni relations soured following Iraq's August 1990 
invasion of Kuwait, when Yemeni leaders voiced support for Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn. 
  Prior to unification North Yemen maintained close economic 
ties with Saudi Arabia, while South Yemen was staunchly Marxist. 
  In Sanaa Saturday six small Yemeni opposition parties called 
for a "national salvation government" to be set up to implement 
a reconciliation agreement signed by Salih and al-Bid in Amman 
on February 20. 
  They accused the northern and the southern leaders of 
"plotting against unity." 
  Meanwhile the YSP accused President Salih of personally 
"directing the war" against supporters of al-Bid, and demanded 
that Salih's brother, Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, be tried for 
"war crimes." 
  In a statement broadcast on Aden radio and television the 
YSP 
said Salih had "ordered the destruction" of the southern brigade 
based in 'Imran by northern forces led by Ahmar.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the Higher Committee of the </F>
Yemeni Reform Grouping; place and date not given] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Praised be God who said: And fear the trial which affecteth not 
in particular only those of you who do wrong. [koranic verse] 
God's peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad and all 
his family and companions. 
  Our people were celebrating the first anniversary of the 27 
April 1993 elections -- which were viewed by all as a solution 
to the crises and problems witnessed by our country throughout 
the transitional period and as the beginning of a new stage of 
stability and development -- when evil elements that feed on 
crises and problems, that do not wish our country and people 
well, and that do not want security and stability moved to sow 
sedition among the sons of the one Yemeni people, triggering 
violent clashes among the comrades-in-arms in the 'Imran camp. 
As a result, a large number of our sons and brothers -- 
officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces and innocent citizens 
-- were martyred or wounded and military vehicles and hardware 
were destroyed for no reason except the desire of certain party 
leaders to escalate the political crisis that has been going on 
for about nine months. This crisis has adversely affected all 
the political, economic, and security aspects of life. It harmed 
the citizens and gravely affected their lives for the sake of 
realizing parochial partisan interests devoid of any sense of 
national responsibility or care for the homeland's unity, 
sovereignty, and stability. 
  While expressing its extreme regret, sorrow, and 
condemnation 
of what happened at the 'Imran camp, the Higher Committee of the 
Yemeni Reform Grouping would like to extend its sincere 
condolences to the families of the martyrs who fell in this 
criminal incident, and to all members of the patient Yemeni 
people everywhere who lost brave sons whom they prepared to 
defend Yemen and its sovereignty and independence and not to 
realize parochial wishes and interests. It also beseeches 
Almighty God to encompass them with His grace, grant their 
relatives and families patience and consolation, and ensure the 
speedy recovery of the wounded. 
  Out of its religious and national responsibility, out of its 
care for the blood of the sons of the one unified Yemen, and out 
of its desire to maintain unity, the Higher Committee of the 
Yemeni Reform Grouping would like to emphasize what it has 
already announced and demanded: The Armed Forces must be away 
from party conflicts and the neutrality of this national 
institution must be maintained. It must be considers the 
property of the entire Yemeni people and not a single party. 
The Armed Forces should not be used to achieve partisan aims 
and purposes. The Reform Grouping also stresses the need to 
rebuild, unite, and merge the Armed Forces according to national 
principles so that they become the forces of the one united 
Yemeni people and be loyal to God only. Their task should be 
that of protecting the homeland and defending its sovereignty, 
independence, security, and stability. 
  The Reform Grouping also calls on the competent quarters to 
expedite investigations into what happened, identify those 
responsible, and send those parties to the judiciary for 
judgment. The results should be announced to the people so that 
the truth will be known and the public can be reassured about 
the situation. It also calls on every individual and group to 
rise up to the level of their responsibility, exercise 
self-restraint, resort to reason, spare the Yemeni people's 
blood everywhere, adopt dialogue, and avoid the use of force to 
resolve conflicts. It appeals to the sons of the Armed Forces 
in particular and the Yemeni people in general to be alert and 
cautious, not to be dragged in by those who want to implicate 
them in armed conflict for personal gains, and to confront 
anyone who tries to harm Yemen or threaten its unity. 
  The Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping extends 
its thanks and appreciation to the honorable tribesmen for their 
sense of responsibility and their rejection of oneupmanship and 
calls aimed at disrupting their unity. Even those whose 
difficult circumstances forced them to adopt some wrong 
positions soon discovered the plans aimed at embroiling them 
into actions in which neither they nor their homeland had any 
interest. 
  Proceeding from its sense of responsibility before God and 
out of its loyalty to the people and its concern for Yemeni 
unity, and in an effort to spare the blood of the Yemeni people, 
the Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping calls on the 
coalition leadership to meet as soon as possible to examine the 
situation, avert further deterioration, achieve security and 
stability, maintain the new democratic experiment, respect the 
nation's will, and end the suffering of the citizens. It 
considers the coalition government leadership primarily 
responsible for the implementation of the provisions of the 
coalition document and the coalition government program, which 
was approved by the House of Representatives. It is also 
responsible for the implementation of the pledge and accord 
document, which was approved by the Political Forces Dialogue 
Committee and signed on 10 Ramadan, 20 February 1994, in Amman. 
May God keep Yemen united, ward off any harm to its people, 
unite hearts along the path of good and right, and grant us 
success. He has power over all things. 
  [Signed] The Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping

<F P=106> ["Text" of Yemeni Presidential Council statement issued in </F>
Sanaa on 30 April] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
God's peace and blessings be upon the most honorable of prophets 
and messengers. O sons of our great Yemeni people: The 
Presidential Council, which was greatly grieved by the fierce, 
bloody fighting in the 'Imran camp between comrades-in-arms from 
the 1st and 3d Armored Brigades--which started at 2100 on 27 
April, which coincided with the first anniversary of the day of 
democracy and constitutional legitimacy, and ended at 0900 on 28 
April-- would like to present the following facts to you: 
  Sincere efforts have been made during the transitional stage 
and since the establishment of the unified state, the Republic 
of Yemen, to merge the armed forces as part of a well-studied 
and comprehensive plan that would eliminate the remains of 
divisive colonialism and put an end to partisan and individual 
loyalties so that the military institution would act solely in 
the service of the homeland and the people. However, these 
efforts have continuously been strongly opposed by the leaders 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], who have obstructed all 
these efforts. They have not hidden their fear that their loss 
of control over several military units might rob them of the 
card they are using to achieve their political aims -- 
threatening to restore the pre-22 May 1990 situation if they do 
not get a sufficient number of seats in the House of 
Representatives to enable them to maintain an equal share of the 
power they enjoyed during the transitional period. The clashes 
and the regrettable riots in Ta'izz on 19 December 1993 were 
meant to prevent the parliamentary elections on 27 April. Due 
to the people's resolve and will, the parliamentary elections 
took place on 27 April last year. The results defined the size 
of every political party in the field, thus enhancing the fears 
of the YSP secessionists. Despite the concessions made to 
preserve unity and achieve national accord, these secessionist 
elements in the YSP leadership could not stand the idea of 
losing even a meager percentage of their seats in the 
government. They, therefore, concealed their exasperation until 
the time became ripe to fabricate a crisis from pretexts and 
excuses that would allow them to dictate their conditions and 
demands to restore the few positions they lost, or else they 
would employ the card of separation, bargaining over unity to 
conceal their true aims. 
  We were taken by surprise, just like you, by the eruption of 
a crisis, which began with the return to Aden of Presidential 
Council Vice Chairman brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid on 19 August for 
no reason and without prior warning. The escalation of that 
crisis began in a well-contrived manner by launching campaign of 
words aimed at stimulating emotions, justifying rebellion 
against constitutional legitimacy, and foiling the results of 
the first general parliamentary elections. Personal demands 
were concealed behind public demands for local consumption in 
order to deceive the public in Yemen and abroad. Nevertheless, 
it was impossible to carry out the sinful separatist scheme, 
which became increasingly obvious, due to our people's adherence 
to unity and democracy. The secessionist elements among the YSP 
then began to foment sedition and conflicts in the society by 
inciting sectarian and regional feuds, and by misdirecting the 
Armed Forces in a bid to implicate them in conflicts and 
destructive fighting in the hope that a sisterly or friendly 
party, like the Arab League, would then interfere to disengage 
the forces in a manner that would allow for the return of the 
military units to the part of the country to which they belonged 
and make it possible to split the country and restore the pre-22 
May 1990 situation. 
  The first attempt to execute that plan took place in the 
wake of the signing of the pledge and accord document in Amman 
on 20 February, corresponding to 10 Ramadan. Then, troops from 
the 5th Armored Brigade from Aden and the al-Wahdah Brigade from 
Hadhramaut were sent to besiege the al-'Amaliqah forces and to 
terrorize citizens in the Abyan Governorate. That plan was 
foiled. However, a few days later, the secessionist elements 
fomented a sedition in the Harbi Sufyan area and then in 
Shabwah. Then, elements inimical to the revolution and unity 
joined the YSP command's secessionist elements to inflame civil 
strife. That plan, too, was foiled. That was followed by the 
events that took place at the Ba Suhayb camp in Dhamar. Most 
recently, the scene of the plot was the 'Imran camp, where 
fighting flared between brothers and comrades-in-arm from among 
the personnel of the 3d Armored Brigade and the 1st Armored 
Brigade after they experienced years of love and peace since the 
proclamation of unity. However, the secessionist forces issued 
hasty orders for the command of the 3d Armored Brigade to open 
fire with tanks and machine guns on the personnel of the 1st 
Armored Brigade, some of whom were performing prayers at the 
camp's mosque while others were safely having their lunch. The 
joint military committee was also present at the camp. 
  Consequently, many of the sons of our unified people and 
Armed Forces were martyred. Perhaps it is our fate as people 
adhering to their homeland's unity to pay the price for the 
suspicious aid that the secessionists receive--a price paid in 
innocent souls and chaste blood. It was no coincidence that 
that terrible and bloody fighting took place on the first 
anniversary of the first general elections in united Yemen. 
Choosing the day of democracy as a date for the fighting was 
meant to spoil our people's joy. It was a premeditated attack 
imposed by those seeking to circumvent the pledge and accord 
document, evade its implementation, and to push the homeland 
back to the pre-22 May 1990 situation. 
  The Presidential Council expresses its heart-felt 
condolences 
to the families of the martyrs, to our Armed and Security 
Forces, and to the masses of our Yemeni people. It reaffirms 
its commitment to take care of bereaved families and to treat 
the wounded. It stresses that the martyrs are the martyrs of 
unity and the sons of the unified Yemeni homeland. Their souls 
and chaste blood are dear to us. As the brother Presidential 
Council chairman proposed, the Presidential Council urges that 
the regrettable 'Imran camp calamity be a lesson to everyone and 
a deterrent for those who play with fire. The Presidential 
Council urges everyone to heed reason, logic, wisdom, and 
dialogue, and to place the interest of the homeland above all 
other considerations. It also stresses the need to respect 
constitutional legitimacy, to abide by the people's will and 
national options, and to absolutely and unconditionally accept 
the principle of peaceful alternation of power. It urges the 
House of Representatives to play its constitutional duty. It 
stresses the need to implement the pledge and accord document, 
starting with the articles dealing with security and military 
issues. The Presidential Council also calls for a halt in 
military incidents by immediately removing military tension, 
withdrawing military units from the former border areas, and 
redeploying them in accordance with the stipulations of the 
pledge and accord document. 
  The Presidential Council also stresses the importance of 
respecting the people's will through unconditional abidance by 
the democratic option, which is the people's unequivocal choice. 
The Council urges extensive national efforts by the sons of our 
people, by political forces, and by mass organizations to defend 
unity and prevent fighting. They are urged to exercise 
political vigilance and national, unionist awareness to ward off 
the dangers posed to the homeland and its unionist gains. It 
also calls on the personnel of the Armed and Security Forces to 
act at the level of the people's confidence in them -- as 
defenders of the homeland and a shield for the revolution, 
unity, and constitutional legitimacy. It urges them to be fully 
vigilant to avert the intentions of those who want to foment 
sedition and divide the homeland. The Council will acquaint the 
people with all the facts when the investigations conclude and 
when the names of all those responsible for what has happened 
are declared. 
  We beseech God to spare our beloved Yemeni homeland any harm 
and to safeguard our people against any affliction. God's peace 
and blessings be upon you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Badr Hammam, President Husni </F>
Mubarak's envoy to Yemen, in Sanaa by Muhammad al-Aswad in 
Cairo, date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Aswad] In light of your mission in the Yemeni 
Republic, what are your impressions of the crisis in fraternal 
Yemen and how are Egypt's efforts to contain it received? 
  [Hammam] Several months have passed since the Yemeni crisis 
started and we are working with all the parties in Yemen to 
contain the situation and to prevent it from erupting We want to 
continue with the process of protecting Yemeni unity and with 
implementation of the Pledge and Accord Document prepared by all 
the Yemeni parties that took part in the dialogue committee. 
The document sets the single course to be pursed by Yemen 
toward building the unified state the Yemenis want. 
  There are incidents along this course, including the 
military 
clash in 'Imran, about 60 kms to the north of Sanaa. It goes 
without saying that the tension in this crisis is bound to put 
the ordinary citizen and the Yemeni Armed Forces on edge because 
they care about Yemen and are worried about their country's 
future. Anxiety is normal is such crises. But the use of the 
Yemeni Armed Forces in a political contest, even if this contest 
reaches the level of struggle, is impermissible and brings many 
dangers to Yemen, its people, territories, unity, present, and 
future. I believe that the Yemeni leaders are aware of these 
dangers. I also believe that they are aware of the dangers of 
involving the Yemeni armed forces in this partisan political 
competition that arose because of differences in views over the 
ways to achieve a unified state. We are clearly and firmly 
drawing their attention to these dangers. 
  [Al-Aswad] Ambassador Hammam, you have met with the Yemeni 
leaders, particularly President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his 
deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid. What are your impressions from these 
meetings and what are the obstacles impeding the implementation 
of the Pledge and Accord Document? 
  [Hammam] My impression is that all the leaders are aware of 
the dangers, are keen on Yemen's unity, and have the desire to 
implement the Pledge and Accord Document. But there are 
different views over the manner of implementation and of the 
crisis factors. This is normal. But involving the Yemeni Armed 
Forces or using them in this political competition is 
impermissible and should not be undertaken. This involvement is 
a very grave matter. 
  I met with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and with Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Aden and also met with 
'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al- Ghani, member of the Presidential 
Council. We discussed the means of containing the current 
situation and of regarding the armed clash between two Yemeni 
Armed Forces' units in 'Imran as an isolated incident that we 
should not focus on. We should not forget the main course we 
have started, namely the implementation of the Pledge and Accord 
Document and protection of Yemen's unity, territorial integrity, 
and the safety of its people. I believe that all the Yemeni 
leaders are fully aware of this fact. I find that all of them 
have good intentions and I hope that this will get us what we 
want, God willing. 
  [Al-Aswad] You mentioned the broad context of the agreement 
but how can this be transformed into action and how can Yemen 
emerge from its current crisis? 
  [Hammam] The problem, as is the case the world over, is how 
to unite the state's agencies and institutions that are 
entrusted with implementing the Pledge and Accord Document and 
how to keep the Yemeni Armed Forces from being involved in this 
political conflict. 
  Struggle for power is normal and happens in many countries, 
but Yemeni unity is a great deed and achievement and cherished 
by all Yemenis and Arabs. Maintaining this unity requires 
further patience and effort. It is no small venture that can be 
completed overnight; it is a great task that necessarily faces 
problems and impediments. It is wise and useful that we be 
patient and take care in finding solutions for them. 
  [Al-Aswad] How do the brothers in Yemen view Egypt's clear 
role in the efforts to contain the Yemeni crisis and bring a 
fraternal united Yemen to the shore of safety? 
  [Hammam] What I encounter and hear here from officials and 
average citizens I meet is a sincere and conscious welcome for 
Egypt's efforts and role because we are sincerely and seriously 
working to preserve Yemen's security, interest, and 
independence. I believe they fully realize Egypt's sincere 
intention and President Mubarak's personal interest in, and 
regular follow-up of, what happens in Yemen. Therefore, 
President Mubarak gave instructions for me to return to Yemen on 
the 28th [April]. I had returned to Cairo for only a couple of 
days, but the flare-up of the military situation between two 
units in 'Imran prompted President Mubarak to return me to Yemen 
at once so that I could follow up the situation, propose, 
according to his directives, possible solutions to contain this 
marginal crisis, the crisis of the military clash, and pursue 
the path to settle the Yemeni crisis through objective solutions 
satisfactory to all parties.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 May (MENA) -- Arab diplomatic sources in 
Cairo have stated that the shuttles that President Mubarak's 
envoy Ambassador Badr Hammam is currently making between Sanaa 
and Aden are the "last hope" in the attempts designed to prevent 
the outbreak of a devastating all-out civil war between north 
and south Yemen. According to these sources, numerous Arab and 
international parties have exerted intensive efforts to mediate 
between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, leader of the General 
People's Congress [GPC] in Sanaa, and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice 
president and Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leader in Aden, to 
preserve the unity of the state. However, the mediation efforts 
have been in vain and failed to prevent the recent military 
clashes that left more than 1,000 military personnel dead. 
These sources expressed their fear that the Yemeni crisis might 
reach the point of no return in view of the resumption of 
clashes between the northern and southern forces. They also 
expressed their fear that Yemen may not remain united. 
  These sources noted that the Yemeni opposition is currently 
demanding that confidence be withdrawn from the government 
because it is responsible for the current disarray. They 
pointed out that the opposition is demanding the formation of a 
national salvation government in which all political forces 
participate in order to preserve the unity of the state and 
implement the "Pledge and Accord" document on national 
reconciliation that was recently signed in Amman. 
  The battles that occurred in the 'Imran camp north of Sanaa 
represent a fresh escalation of a serious political crisis that 
has continued for eight months between the two main parties in 
the ruling coalition, the GPC in the north and the YSP in the 
south. During their propaganda campaign they traded severe 
accusations that the other one is seeking to secede and is 
responsible for the deterioration of the political and economic 
situation in Yemen. 
  This crisis has crippled political and economic activities 
and caused Vice President al-Bid to stay in Aden and refuse to 
return to Sanaa. It has also led to the deterioration in the 
economic situation, caused the national currency to plummet, 
inflation to spiral, prices to go up, and unemployment to 
increase because of a lack of new jobs as local investments 
declined and foreign investors fear to enter the Yemen market in 
view of instability and the assassination and kidnapping of 
foreigners. 
  Despite the recent signing of the "Pledge and Accord" 
document in Amman following intensive mediation by Jordan's King 
Husayn, the two parties to the conflict failed to implement its 
clauses. This document has been frozen, as it is the only hope 
for the Yemeni people to emerge from the crisis and the Yemeni 
leaders have already signed it and approved its clauses. Arab 
sources in Cairo affirm that Egypt's efforts, led by President 
Mubarak, are almost the last ditch for the Yemenis to keep the 
banners of unity flying.

  [Text] Our country and the Yemeni working class today 
celebrated 1 May, the International Labor Day. On this 
important occasion, a major speech rally was held this morning 
at the Culture Hall in Sanaa's Cultural Center. Brother Dr. 
Muhammad Sa'id al- 'Attar, deputy prime minister, chairman of 
the Higher Investment Commission, and industry minister, 
attended. 
  Brother Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar delivered the state's 
and government's speech. He said he was happy to attend this 
event and share with the Yemeni working class its celebrations 
of the International Labor Day. 
  He said the Yemeni labor movement has played an honorable 
and 
pioneering role in defending the revolution and the republic, in 
achieving unity, and in establishment the Yemeni Republic on 22 
May 1990, noting that the country will soon celebrate its fourth 
anniversary. The deputy prime minister explained that this 
anniversary will come as our country experiences serious 
political and economic conditions as a result of the political 
crisis. He said some enemies of unity and democracy want this 
crisis to continue at the expense of the citizens' pressing 
issues and daily, urgent living conditions and worries, 
particularly those of workers. He said the current phase 
experienced by the state of unity compels the various trends of 
the labor movement to confront serious national missions to 
defend and protect the unity and preserve its continuity and 
survival, according to the pledge and accord document.

  [Text] Sanaa, May 1 (AFP)--Yemen President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih ordered Sunday [1 May] the release of southern troops who 
surrendered to northern forces after bitter fighting north of 
Sanaa last week, in which dozens were killed. 
  Meanwhile officials in the capital accused southern forces 
of 
massing troops along the former border which divided North and 
South Yemen before unification in May 1990. 
  The official news agency SABA' said Salih, the rival of Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, ordered that southern 
troops who surrendered after clashes Wednesday and Thursday in 
the 'Imran region, 60 kilometers (36 miles) north of Sanaa, 
would be free to return to their units. 
  The ferocious tank battles left nearly 200 dead and dozens 
of 
others wounded, according to journalists. 
  But the Defence Ministry in Sanaa said 79 people were killed 
and 119 wounded, while an unknown number of others had fled or 
disappeared. 
  Salih said he had ordered the state to pay for 11 seriously 
wounded southern troops to be flown abroad for hospital 
treatment, SABA' reported. Three had already left Sanaa for 
Jordan Saturday. 
  Northern military officials said several hundred troops of 
the southern third armoured brigade at 'Imran had joined the 
northern forces. 
  A Defence Ministry spokesman in Sanaa said 85 tanks were 
destroyed in the fighting, which caused more than 500 million 
dollars' worth of damage. 
  Salih pledged that the buildings hit in 'Imran would be 
rebuilt. 
  The armies of north and south, each totalling about 30,000, 
have never merged since unification. 
  Military officials in the capital said there were "large 
concentrations of southern troops along the former border" 
Sunday, and accused al-Bid's supporters of "wanting to push the 
country into a bloody civil war." 
  The officials also said southern jets were buzzing northern 
units based in the Abyan region, east of the southern port city 
of Aden. 
  Fighting erupted in Abyan in February and the officials said 
"secessionist" elements in al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) 
were planning fresh attacks on the northern al-Amaliqa brigade 
based there. 
  Yemen's political crisis erupted in August, when al-Bid 
refused to take up his duties in Sanaa, demanding major economic 
and military reforms and citing security fears.

  [Text] Aden, 1 May (MENA) -- A spokesman for the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] Political Bureau has commented on the 
Presidential Council statement that was released in Sanaa 
yesterday evening. He said that the Presidential Council has 
revealed its convictions and clarified the truth about its 
rejection of a plan to merge the armed forces that the defense 
minister put forward four times in the past few years. Merging 
the armies would have exposed the corruption and smuggling by 
the officers of the al-Ahmar clan, who rob the soldiers' 
salaries and food, torture and humiliate them, and seize funds 
earmarked for military supplies. 
  The spokesman noted that merging the armed forces would have 
meant providing them with qualified personnel who would make 
them loyal not to their tribes and clans but to the homeland and 
its constitutional institutions so the armed forces would become 
the protectors of the homeland. He pointed out that the refusal 
to merge the armed forces exposes a plan to isolate and strike 
at them, as has happened in Abyan, (Harf), Safyan, and 'Imran. 
  The spokesman criticized the Yemeni Presidential Council 
statement, which talks of democracy and legitimacy while it 
constantly tramples them. It assailed the Yemeni president and 
his method of reaching power and ruling the country.

<F P=106> [Speech by Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant General </F>
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih at meeting with "officers, NCO's and 
soldiers of the 3d Armored Brigade" in Sanaa on 1 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Brothers and sons, members and fighters of the 3d Armored 
Brigade in the unity state: With deep sorrow and pain, we ask 
God to have mercy on our righteous martyrs, our beloved sons. 
We ask God not to forgive those who hatched out this suicidal 
conspiracy among the comrades in arms, among the Armed Forces 
members. You are the nation's vanguards. You became the 
vanguards of Yemeni unity when you supported the political 
decision as it was announced on 22 May 1990. Had it not been 
for the insistence of the fighters in the Yemeni Armed Forces in 
what was formerly known as the southern and northern parts of 
the homeland, unity would not have been attained. Had it not 
been for the insistence of the fighters and the pro-unity 
members in the Armed Forces in what used to be called the two 
parts of Yemen before 22 May, unity would not have been achieved. 
  We know the irresponsible, treacherous, and political 
designs 
under which our people, sons, and colleagues in the southern 
governorates have been erroneously mobilized and how they [the 
south Yemeni leaders] would govern Yemen in their own way, on 
the basis of Marxist ideology. They have thus instilled false 
ideologies in the minds of our Arab and Muslim people and said 
Yemen would be governed by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
leadership, which has not respected what we agreed to on 30 
November and 22 May when it found itself on the verge of falling 
in the wake of the collapse of the Socialist bloc. I went to 
heroic Aden to meet with our unionist colleagues. Some of the 
YSP leaders have gone back on their stands and retreated due to 
the mistaken calculations that unity would be achieved and 
[words indistinct] the two parts of Yemen, this united Yemen 
with our Marxist ideologies in spite of the collapse of the 
Socialist bloc. They did not learn from their adventures in 
1972, and 1979 when they tried to fabricate fighting among the 
comrades in arms, among the Armed Forces members. They did not 
learn. The best proof of this is the suicidal operation which 
took place in the 'Imran camp where they received false 
information, and they became certain that they should disengage 
the Armed Forces members and that the 3d Armored Brigade, those 
heroes, my sons, and brothers would attack their colleagues in 
the 1st Brigade. They then planned to act through the elements 
they had sent to topple the republican regime, the regime of the 
unity state in Sanaa. The brigade was to have left for Sanaa. 
  As proof of this we see that when unity was achieved the YSP 
insisted on sending the best fighters to Sanaa. We agreed to 
this if this would secure unity and reassure the YSP leaders. 
As you know, the party has become accustomed to carrying out 
attacks every four or five years. We remember 13 January. We 
remember the [word indistinct] incidents]. We also remember the 
[word indistinct] incidents. In all these incidents, people 
were killed and blood was shed. 
  I hold the officers, NCO's, and soldiers responsible. They 
should tell the facts, fear only God, and tell the Yemeni people 
the truth about how the party falsely mobilized them. This is 
an adventure [word indistinct] in a losing battle between you 
and your colleagues in the 1st Brigade. Only the homeland's 
enemies benefit from it. [Words indistinct] in whose interest 
is this, who wins from this? Who [words indistinct] crisis and 
who has tried to bring back the homeland to the pre-22 May era? 
  This scheme is aimed at getting rid of you because you are 
the fighters. As for the politicians, they are now depositing 
their money in European banks. They are depositing the money 
they received as a price for the crisis and the martyrs. They 
are depositing the money in European banks and we are today 
paying the price. People were killed in 'Imran. They want to 
see people killed in Abyan and Lahij. Was this insufficient? 
Will the Armed Forces learn the lesson? [Words indistinct] I 
do not blame you at all and you bear no responsibility. This is 
the responsibility of those who received the price of the blood 
of martyrs and Army hardware. You are not at all to blame; it 
was the fault of wrong mobilization, the fault of the 
secessionist elements that want to restore the pre-22 May 
situation so they can assume power while raising the slogan of 
power or death. Pure blood, the blood of strugglers who carried 
out the 14 October revolution, and who fought in 'Ayban, Madir, 
and al-Mahabishah in defense of the republican regime. Today, 
they (?come) and say that you are besieged and you were praying 
in one mosque, living in the same barracks, and eating together. 
But classifying people as northerners and southerners or 
Congress members was wrong. I hold you, especially the 
officers, responsible for this. Let them tell us the truth, 
what is the secret behind this classification? Let us hear the 
plain facts. 
  Now 'Ali Salim al-Bid is contacting the outside world saying 
the 3d Brigade is still fighting and that [words indistinct] its 
hardware and soldiers. Is it like this? Have you not [words 
indistinct] with each other? [crowd shouts "yes"] He contacts 
the outside world [words indistinct]. I am sure that you 
extended first aid to each other. You aided the 1st Brigade 
personnel and vice versa. You were made to fight each other but 
you aided each other. Is this not true? [crowd shouts "yes"] 
This is because you are comrades in arms and [words 
indistinct], everyone of you regrets what happened to him and to 
his colleagues because those killed were our sons and those who 
survived are our sons. The Armed Forces should follow 
constitutional legitimacy represented in the state of unity for 
those who are unionist in the capital of the state of unity. If 
the defense minister is indeed a minister of defense for the 
Republic of Yemen, he must command the army from the Defense 
Ministry and fight in the army in defense of unity, democracy, 
security, and stability. The defense minister should not 
represent only one part of the homeland nor should a chief of 
staff represent only one part. This is an agreement which we 
announced and said this is our state and this is our capital and 
these are our problems. They tried the [East] German president, 
and Germany, which was a stronghold of socialism, fell. The 
Soviet Union also fell. The Socialist Party [words indistinct] 
say may God bless our brothers who rescued us from this quagmire 
and brought us unity for the sake of security, stability, and 
democracy [words indistinct] and coexist because we are Muslims, 
because we are Arabs, because we are brothers [words indistinct] 
we are one nation. We are a Muslim people who believe in God's 
book and the traditions of God's prophet, his peace and 
blessings be upon him. 
  Brothers, sons, and colleagues: My heart is bleeding over 
what happened in 'Imran. The Socialist Party is imposing a 
total siege on your colleagues, the comrades in arms, in Abyan, 
and on your colleagues in (Zirwahah) and your brothers in Aden. 
Have we besieged any unit in the northern governorates? No. 
The general escalation [words indistinct]. The officers are 
not to blame. The blame is on the wrong classification. [Words 
indistinct] the 14th or the artillery brigades. What happened 
in 'Imran happened, and we are investigating the incident. 
  The Armed Forces should follow constitutional legitimacy, 
and 
not the leadership deviating from constitutional legitimacy. 
For those who are unionists we say this is the capital of unity 
and our Armed Forces in Hadhramaut, Shabwah, and every 
governorate, in Sa'dah, and in Abyan should announce their 
loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, the republic, the 
Yemeni unity, and the national unity. They should disregard all 
wrong orders from those who want to implicate the Armed Forces. 
'Imran sacrifices are enough. 'Imran martyrs are enough. We 
consider them martyrs of unity, martyrs of security and 
stability. Will the Armed Forces be aware of this or not? 
Accordingly, we will continue to reject the party's orders. Let 
them come to Sanaa for dialogue and understanding. This is our 
capital and not the capital of the north only or the south only. 
  This is our capital, Sanaa, and our capital, Aden, and the 
capital of all (?presidents of the Republic). This is a very 
mistaken mobilization. I am sure that you (?were besieged) and 
that your families and fathers are concerned about you. Why are 
they concerned? They are concerned about you because they 
believe that, according to the party's practice, anyone who 
enters a detention camp [words indistinct]. This is the biggest 
proof of (?13 January) when they used to (?take in batches). 
Your sons and brothers are afraid. This is true, because they 
are concerned about you as you may be detained, imprisoned, 
[word indistinct], tortured, and measures could be taken against 
them, and, perhaps, they could be liquidated. 
  People [words indistinct] wrong, wrong. In other words, 
[words indistinct]. It happened between colleagues. Enough, 
enough [words indistinct]. This is so because no one would 
benefit from it. However, now everyone [words indistinct] and 
safeguards his colleague. You are brothers and comrades in 
arms. Mobilization and [words indistinct] the other party which 
is standing in trenches and breaching the legitimacy. Brothers 
and sons, (?do you accept) this ordeal which we are passing 
through these days? [crowd shouts "no"]. Will our Armned 
Forecs take a lesson? [crowd shouts "yes"]. I have come to 
visit you. They say we [words indistinct]. Did you [words 
indistinct] or did you turn yourselves in? [indistinct shouts ] 
  I came to you [words indistinct] as a father, brother, and 
colleaque. [Words indistinct] all that happened [words 
indistinct] these heroes any problem. Today when [words 
indistinct] the price. This is the truth [words indistinct] 
from a losing battle to a camp in the capital. This talk should 
be terminated among the officers and other ranks. We are not 
[words indistinct], but in the event of any battle the killed 
and wounded should be evacuated. The elements who enjoyed 
safety should also be evacuated to safe areas. 
  First of all, I would like to confirm this [words 
indistinct] 
I came to you, to visit you, and to tell you: This is your 
unity. This is your camp. The 3d Brigade exists. What remains 
of it. Our units are there. You are the army of unity, the 
army of security and stability. Rely on God and go on leave to 
visit your families and relatives. This all depends on your 
conscience. Those who support unity will be supporting honor. 
Those who support secession... [shouts and applause]. Your 
tank is there and your artillery is there under the canopy of 
the unity state. Those who will [word indistinct] will be 
condemned [shouts and applause). These are your tanks, and your 
artillery. If we are sincere in what we say, [words 
indistinct] all your losses. There is no danger on you in the 
battle. I will pay for them. I will pay all your salaries. I 
will pay all your indemnities. You will come out with me with 
your personal weapons to let you regain your prestige. You 
lost, and the 1st Brigade lost. I will arm you and the 1st 
Brigade and restore the two brigades' credibility. The other 
units in the Armed Forces should learn the lesson, that we are 
waging a losing battle. However, we will be forced to fight to 
defend unity and democracy and confront the secessionists. We 
will confront any secessionist [applause]. 
  Now, what are we doing? We are [words indistinct] come and 
besiege the 2d Brigade. The brother chief of staff has been 
tasked to disburse salaries and to distribute personal weapons 
to the officer, NCO's, and soldiers. Then, after your return 
from your leave, we will form a committee comprising officers 
from the 1st and 3d Brigades to determine material losses 
incurred by the officers, NCO's, and soldiers in a responsible 
manner and we will then try to compensate what we can. 
  Some believe that these officers, NCO's, and soldiers will 
[words indistinct] bring pressure to bear on the YSP leadership 
to have it not carry out any hostile actions against their 
colleagues in the (?south). If they carry out any aggression 
against their colleagues, they will pay a prohibitive price 
[applause]. They will pay a prohibitive price, and I am sure 
that you will side with unity and support your colleagues 
[applause]

  [Text] Sanaa, 27 Apr (INA) -- An official Yemeni source has 
denied reports that Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemeni minister 
of planning and development, has submitted his resignation. 
  In a statement to an INA correspondent, the official Yemeni 
source dismissed such reports as completely baseless. 
  In its latest issue, the opposition Yemeni paper AL-WAHDAWI 
said Dr. al-Irayni had resigned his ministerial post. The paper 
said the resignation was kept quiet to allow time to convince 
him to withdraw it.

after the failure to implement the reconciliation agreement 
between the Yemeni president and his deputy. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO's Economic </F>
Department, by Kamal Tarabayh, in Paris on 29 April; from the 
"The Event" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Tarabayh] We appreciate your taking time off to 
speak on "The Event" program to mark the signing in Paris of an 
agreement setting out future economic relations between the 
Palestinians and Israel. You have been involved from the start 
in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, first about self-rule 
and later about economic issues. Are you comfortable with the 
results? 
  [Quray'] I cannot contain my relief over the agreement 
reached about the issues that we dealt with -- what we have 
called the Paris Economic Relations Pact. The interim stage and 
the self-rule laws restrict our ambition to start a completely 
independent institution. However, the results we have attained 
from these negotiations lay the foundations and sow the strong 
seeds of an independent Palestinian state. Let me give you an 
example. Take currency and banks... 
  [Tarabayh, interrupting] So, from your perspective this is a 
general agreement that lays the foundations for the economic 
ties between Israel and the Palestinians. 
  [Quray'] That's correct. It is also a contractual agreement 
for the interim stage, not a final agreement. It is not an 
agreement whereby tariffs are nonexistent, as some have said. 
It is not a free trade agreement, as has been rumored. It is a 
contractual agreement for a transition period during which 
relations will be regulated and the Israeli and Palestinian 
economies will be disengaged... 
  [Tarabayh, interrupting] With the understanding that the 
agreement be reviewed later? 
  [Quray'] Yes, periodically. And, in the final stage, it 
will be reviewed radically and completely. 
  [Tarabayh] How does the agreement address the banking and 
monetary system? 
  [Quray'] Right from the start of the occupation, the 
Israelis have sought to shut down the banks and take control of 
monetary institutions and replace any Arab or foreign banks with 
Israeli banks. Whoever has control of the money secures control 
over the economic lifeline. That has been the policy of the 
occupation authorities from the first day of occupation in 1967. 
The agreement breathes new life into Palestinian financial 
institutions. It also expressly provides for the establishment 
of a multi-purpose Palestinian monetary institution as the 
official point of reference for the National Palestinian 
Authority and the public sector. It will act as an advisory 
body and hold the reserves of the National Palestinian 
Authority. There will be a special administration that will be 
responsible for licensing commercial banks and specialized banks 
and exchange services and money markets. It will monitor their 
performance and transactions. 
  [Tarabayh] Under what sort of monetary authority, a central 
bank, or what? 
  [Quray'] It will be not be called a central bank, but will 
handle all the responsibilities of one, except issue Palestinian 
currency. The institution that was established is a Palestinian 
central bank minus the function of issuing currency. You know 
that in some Arab states there is what they call the monetary 
agency, as in Saudi Arabia. It enjoys the full powers of 
issuing and protecting currency, among other functions. Thus, 
the establishment of the Palesinian Monetary Authority is one of 
the important seeds of Palestinian sovereignty and national 
independence. It is the only and fundamental means of 
reinjecting the Palestinian economy's veins with blood that has 
dried up over the years of occupation. 
  [Tarabayh] But, in this context, you have registered a 
retreat with regard to the Palestinian currency. What was the 
alternative? 
  [Quray'] As a matter of fact, the issue has nothing to do 
with either a retreat or progress on our part. We never thought 
the issue of launching a Palestinian currency would be 
accomplished without difficulties. We do have the right to 
issue a Palestinian currency. This right has remained intact. 
The agreement has underscored the Palestinians' right to issue 
their own currency. Hence, the agreement stipulated that the 
talks will continue, through the Joint Palestinian-Israeli 
Committee, in the immediate aftermath of the signing of this 
agreement to examine and consider the issuance of Palestinian 
currency. They have made offers that we have categorically 
rejected. 
  [Tarabayh] What are the offers they have made? 
  [Quray'] For instance, they have offered the issuance of a 
currency similar to the Scottish currency. We have 
categorically rejected this. This Palestinian currency was 
meant to be guaranteed by the Central Bank of Israel. We 
rejected this. We are speaking of an independent Palestinian 
currency to be issued by the Palestinian National Authority. If 
not possible today, let it be issued six months, or one year, 
from now. 
  [Tarabayh] Pending the materialization of this, what 
currency 
will be used? Will it be the Israeli shekel? 
  [Quray'] First, there is the Jordanian dinar, which is a 
basic and major currency in circulation. Moreover, there is 
also the shekel, which is also in circulation. They wanted the 
shekel to be legal tender [preceding two words in English]. We 
rejected this. We eventually agreed that the shekel will be a 
circulated currency. It goes without saying that we cannot do 
without the shekel as a circulated currency. This issue must be 
clear. For what is important is not to stick to slogans, but 
rather to be aware of the practices on the ground. The shekel 
is circulated on the ground. There are 2 billion shekels in 
circulation among the people. The workers' revenues and wages, 
which exceed $500-700 million per year, are paid in shekels. 
The trade exchange is also a factor to be taken into account. 
You cannot forget about these three factors at will, or just to 
vindicate a slogan. But, you can streamline, examine, and 
control these factors until you reach the desired situation. 
Hence, during the interim period, this interim contractual 
economic agreement will determine our moves with regard to the 
Israeli, Jordanian, or Palestinian currencies. 
  [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-'Ala': One of the outstanding issues 
concerned customs tariffs. There were Israeli concerns about 
this issue. By contrast, there was Palestinian determination 
regarding uncontrolled imports to the occupied territories. The 
Palestinians have eventually triumphed. 
  [Quray'] As a matter of fact, I can say we have achieved a 
significant part of what we sought in this area. We have not 
achieved all that we wanted. It is impossible for us to achieve 
all that we want. 
  [Tarabayh] How then have you dispelled Israeli concerns? 
  [Quray'] Let me tell you how. First, during the interim 
period, there are no demarcated borders. Consequently, the 
movement of commodities will continue to be free. The free 
movement of commodities from one market to another will cause 
one market to lose considerably if the customs tariffs are not 
close to one another. This was one of the major arguments they 
have advanced in this regard. I also believe that there were 
political considerations at play here. For, since the 
occupation of 1967, they have erected a high and extremely 
stringent wall of customs tariffs around the occupied 
territories. They incorporated the exports and imports of the 
occupied territories into the exports and imports of Israel. 
This all became part and parcel of the Israeli trade balance. 
Hence, there was no regional or international trade status for 
the occupied Palestinian territories. This status lost its 
distinct identity, and became part of the Israeli economy. This 
is how they planned. Now, what has this agreement produced? 
This agreement has put forth three, or four highly significant 
basic principles. 
  The first principle is that imports reflect the nature of 
the 
trade situation. There were no Arab ties at all with the 
occupied territories. Trade ties between the Arab countries and 
the occupied territories were one-sided. It is true that Arab 
countries received imports from the occupied territories. 
However, these countries have not exported commodities to these 
territories. Moreover, Palestinian merchants, businessmen, or 
lay men were unable to import commodities from Arab countries. 
  The other issue is that there were no ties at all with the 
Islamic world. Such ties were banned and prohibited. 
  The third issue is that the entire trade transactions, as 
well as the export and import operations with the outside world 
were part of the Israeli trade, as I have just mentioned. 
Therefore, this customs wall requires a shake, some 
disturbance, and a loophole if the new Palestinian baby is to be 
catapulted onto its strategic Arab stage, further onto its 
Islamic stage, and then onto the international stage. This has 
been achieved. Imports have been streamlined. There are four 
lists, in addition to a fifth one. The first list of 
commodities, on which we have agreed, concerns Arab products 
that will be procured by the occupied territories, particularly 
products coming from Egypt and Jordan. With regard to this 
list, it is the Palestinian authority that will make all customs 
and import policies regarding this list of commodities. 
Furthermore, it is the agency that will decide on the proper 
customs tariffs and fees in complete independence. 
  There is another list called A2. This is also a completely 
independent list of commodities including the commodities that 
will be imported from Arab and Islamic states. It is the first 
time Islamic states are being dealt with. It is the Palestinian 
authority that will determine the policies and customs tariffs 
and fees regarding this list of commodities in total freedom. 
  The third list concerns international aid, in development 
requirements, humanitarian aid, or construction equipment, etc. 
Once again, it is the Palestinian authority alone that will, by 
itself, decide on the customs fees of this list of commodities, 
the rates of these fees, and how these commodities enter the 
territories. This authority will make the overall policy 
regarding this list of commodities. 
  [Tarabayh] How is the Israeli authority then involved in 
this? 
  [Quray'] These lists are a Palestinian decision. The fourth 
list, which we called List B, is a very big one. The 
Palestinian authority decides all fees, custom tariffs, purchase 
tax, and others. However, imports, licenses, standards, and 
measurements will follow a joint policy. Luxury goods will also 
be subjected to joint tariffs and duties. This customs system, 
or customs wall, which was standing like steel around the 
occupied territory, has been shaken and the Palestinians emerged 
from it with a small customs book, which will undoubtedly grow 
and get bigger. For the sake of truth, it should be said that 
we were joined with brothers from Jordan on a very high level of 
knowledge, experience, expertise, and responsibility. They came 
from the high levels of power. They were with us for one and 
one-half months or more. We cooperated with each other, reached 
understanding, and discussed the overall proposed topics on a 
daily basis. We were also in constant and almost daily contact 
with our brothers in Egypt and a large number of experts and 
officials. We discussed things and exchanged views with them 
because we need expertise and experience in such matters. 
  [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-'Ala', there are many points in the 
agreement, particularly on tourism, agriculture, industry, 
energy, insurance, and so forth. In you opinion and without 
delving into the details of these points, what was the most 
prominent Palestinian accomplishment among these sectors? 
  [Quray'] I can say all these sectors. However, if I speak or 
someone addresses me on the basis of complete 100 percent 
independence, I will tell him no. I do not want to exaggerate 
or downplay the importance of what happened. What happened is 
something important. It is a seed, as I have said, to build a 
Palestinian entity, a Palestinian authority, an independent 
Palestinian state, but it is not complete. Had this been 
independence, I would not have negotiated anything with the 
Israelis. But I negotiated because it is a transitional phase. 
In all the mentioned sectors, we took the main seeds that 
prepare for the establishment of the independent institution. 
Industry is now our decision and the standards we decide will 
be the ones which will govern the industrial process. We are 
the ones who license industry and run its products. 
Accordingly, there is an independent Palestinian economic 
decision in the process of developing the industrial sector. 
The same applies to agriculture. There was a totally closed 
market in favor of the Israeli products. Only Israel had access 
to the Palestinian market without allowing the Palestinian 
products to enter the Israeli market. This new agreement opens 
the Israeli market for the first time to Palestinian 
agricultural products. The market has become open to both 
sides. Experience proves that Palestinian agricultural products 
are competitive. The simple Palestinian peasant managed to 
prove his very high competitive efficiency and capability in 
terms of quality and price. Now the Israeli market is open for 
him and competition is also open for him. I have great 
confidence that this Palestinian farmer will triumph in the 
process of competition. What we should not ignore, and what all 
our brothers the economists and others should know, is that they 
must exactly know the suffering and problems of all people, 
peasants, farmers, or workers before passing judgment. 
  [Tarabayh] What about tourism in the transitional phase? 
  [Quray'] A tourism authority has also been established. It 
enjoys all jurisdictions enjoyed by any ministry or tourism 
institution in any independent state. It is true that the 
jurisdiction of this tourism authority will come gradually, as 
stated in the Declaration of Principles. It will begin in Gaza 
and Jericho and then extend to the rest of the West Bank. This 
authority will be in charge of licensing the tourism 
institutions and guides and defining the historical, cultural, 
and religious sites. It can send its tourist buses to Israel or 
abroad and receive buses from the opposite direction. It can 
strike contracts with the tourism delegations. 
  [Tarabayh] Have tourism relations with Israel been defined? 
  [Quray'] They have not yet taken detailed form, but in 
general there is an exchange of tourists between us. The 
tourist who comes to them can come to areas of the Palestinian 
authority and vice versa. 
  [Tarabayh] What about the tourism development projects in 
Gaza and the Gaza beaches, for example? 
  [Quray'] This is a Palestinian decision by the Palestinian 
authority. Israel has not played any role in this and such 
cases have not even been discussed. Issues of joint work have 
not been discussed whether in the tourism or other sectors. We 
are in the stage of charting the framework laws, regulations, 
and bases of the Palestinian economic work and its organization. 
  [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-al-'Ala', when we interviewed you a 
month ago, the issue of the Palestinian manpower was one of the 
strongest issues on the agenda. In particular, there were 
statements by Israeli officials calling for replacing the 
Palestinian workers by foreign workers, particularly Asian 
workers. What was decided on this issue? 
  [Quray'] In fact, they wanted, and this is no longer a 
secret, to exploit this issue as a blackmail card. They use it 
from time to time. I do not mean during the negotiations, but 
in general. I mean when an operation is carried out, there will 
be collective and comprehensive punishment, and 70,000 or 
100,000 workers are blocked. This is a collective punishment. 
It was used. Even at the negotiations, there was an attempt to 
use the workers issue as a blackmail card. We have refused to 
submit to this blackmail. Concerning the workers paper, we were 
interested in the following issues: First, there must be 
ordinary and normal movement of workers. At the beginning, we 
sought for this to be a free movement. They said we control the 
size of this manpower. We said that we also control its size. 
So, the process has become a mutual one. I mean that if they 
have the right to determine this from time to time, we also 
should have the right to decide on this from time to time. This 
is one issue. Another issue is that we were very concerned that 
since we seek to organize future labor relations, then all 
workers' rights must be the responsibility of the Palestinian 
authority, and that we should establish the necessary funds of 
social security and insurance to guarantee the workers' rights. 
This was met with positive response. The basic and important 
issue, which took a large part of the discussion and dialogue, 
is that we were very concerned about the fact that since this 
agreement regulates future relations, then it must not be unfair 
to or undermine acquired rights. Consequently, in this 
agreement, we have stressed that it regulates future relations, 
but it does not close the file on any issue related to the 
acquired rights of workers. On the contrary, it opens this file 
at the appropriate time. It has also confirmed that there are 
acquired rights. 
  [Tarabayh] This means that it guarantees the rights of the 
Palestinian manpower in Israel as they were before autonomy. 
Brother Abu-al-'Ala', finally, there is a question posing 
itself: Is there any contradiction between your economic 
agreement with Israel and that of the economic agreement with 
Jordan? 
  [Quray'] In order to be accurate, I would like to say that 
our main relationship is with the Arabs in general, and with 
Jordan and Egypt in particular. This is our natural 
relationship, which can be relationship of cooperation, 
brotherhood, unity, solidarity, integration. This is the 
relationship which has a strategic depth. Our relationship with 
Israel can be a relationship of cooperation or relationship 
which may or may not involve joint interests. However, with the 
Arab side, this relationship must be based on brotherhood, 
unity, and integration, etc. The nature of the interim period 
does not give the Palestinian side one hundred percent freedom 
to organize this relationship as we really want it to be. Our 
brothers in Jordan and Egypt understand this very accurately. 
This is why we say that they have contributed to forming the 
results of these negotiations. 
  [Tarabayh] For example, what about banking relations with 
Jordan? 
  [Quray'] The truth is that our relations go beyond this. 
This issue has its own philosophy in order to be able to cross 
from the interim period into a situation whose features we draw, 
and whose results are not imposed on us. This relationship with 
Jordan includes everything. It includes money, economy, trade, 
borders, customs, security, etc. This is especially true, 
taking into consideration that half of the Palestinians, or 
less, live in Jordan, as well as the nature of the fraternal, 
historical, and social relations. This issue cannot be evaded 
or ignored. 
  In the matter of the banks, there is no doubt there will be 
a relationship. We have now taken from the Israelis the 
Palestinian monetary authority -- banks, licensing, and so on. 
We must be liberal and indulgent with our brothers in Jordan, 
more than anything else in the interest of building Palestinian 
institutions, availing ourselves of Jordanian expertise, and 
organizing the operation, performance, and monitoring of the 
banks during the interim stage, or for a duration to be agreed 
upon. The agreement reached with Jordan addressed these points 
and the commercial and economic links, in addition to the 
banking system and the movement of money. 
  [Tarabayh] My last question, brother Abu-al-'Ala'. What is 
your reaction to a remark made by Israel's Finance Minister 
Avraham Shohat following the signing of the agreement. He said 
the agreement should make it possible for the Palestinian and 
Israeli people to start and share a new life. 
  [Quray'] Let me put it like this: The agreement shifts the 
Palestinians from a state of dependency to one of a free 
decision whether to extend or withhold cooperation. We should 
also be able to determine the shape of that cooperation. As I 
have said at the beginning, we were in a state of total 
dependency where the Palestinians had no say. Now, they have a 
say; there is a transition period that calls for some measure of 
cooperation on a number of issues. We have now moved from a 
state of dependency where the Palestinians had no say to a 
certain form of cooperation necessitated by the nature of the 
transition period. The Palestinians will make their own 
decisions. 
  [Tarabayh] Thank you Abu-al-'Ala', Mr. Ahmad Quray', the 
PLO's Economic Department chief. One last word about the 
self-rule agreement, expected to be signed next Wednesday [4 
May] in Cairo? 
  [Quray'] I think that, barring unforeseen, last-minute 
snags, the Gaza-Jericho agreement will be signed in Cairo and 
then the Declaration of Principles agreement launched on the 
ground. When that happens, I think the agreement itself will be 
seen in a better light, and, at the same time, it will advance 
Palestinian interests. If the agreement is not put into practice 
it will be seen in a bad light and set back Palestinian 
interests. We, therefore, should, from the beginning, be keen 
to render the agreement a success. 
  [Tarabayh] Thank you, brother Abu-al-'Ala'. 
  [Quray'] Thank you.
