<F P=106> ["Text of dialogue" with Shaykh Na'im Qasim, deputy </F>
secretary general of Hizballah, by Faysal Jallul in Beirut; date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Jallul] Hizballah is at odds with the Lebanese 
State, and therefore, it has to either accept or reject it. It 
seems to us that your party has decided to adapt to the 
situation. This is clear because it did not respond to the 
al-Ghubayrah incident and because it takes part in parliamentary 
action and politics. 
  [Qasim] Adaptation usually means a relinquishment of 
principles. This is wrong and unacceptable. Adherence to 
principles, however, does not necessarily mean a military clash 
with those with whom we differ. The West may want to promote 
the idea that any ideological and political difference with a 
party like ours will inevitably lead to a military clash. We in 
Lebanon have chosen the way of clashes with the Israeli enemy 
only. On the internal level, we believe that ideological and 
political differences should not lead to military clashes. We 
also still believe in the need to promote the Islamic trend and 
thought as the best alternative for the people. We offer our 
faith to others, share with them issues acceptable to us and 
them, explain our views on issues of dispute, and do not believe 
in the use of force to impose our will on others. 
  Therefore, we did not respond militarily to the 13 September 
massacre. Those who perpetrated the massacre wanted to draw us 
into an internal military conflict to justify the international 
security situation, confuse the party, and try to settle some 
scores under the pretext that our party opted for a military 
clash, especially with the Lebanese Army. 
  We did not respond militarily because we do not believe in 
the use of that method by any side and because we did not want 
to be drawn into others' plans whenever and wherever they 
wanted. We view the 13 September massacre as part of a plan to 
strike at the resistance, and not as a transitory issue designed 
to prevent a peaceful demonstration. 
  Regarding mass media propaganda, we believe that this way 
pushes the country toward a unilateral military rule and will 
not lead to the establishment of a free, coexisting Lebanon, 
which we have known and which should continue to be. Without 
such freedoms, there will be no Lebanon. We have no interest in 
confronting the authority through newscasts, and we want to 
prevent any comparison between us and people blasting the 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church. Some people wanted such an unfair 
comparison. Therefore, we deprived them of such a chance. 
  [Jallul] You seem to be supporting the dissolution of the 
Lebanese Forces. 
  [Qasim] We are against any international explosion, we 
condemn any relationship with the Israeli enemy, and we build 
our relations with others on this basis. I believe that a 
peripheral issue led to the dissolution of the Lebanese Forces, 
and it is essential to concentrate on the nature of these forces 
and their positions. We clearly reject the logic of these 
forces and their relationship with the Israeli enemy. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Jallul] You are linked with Iran by spiritual and 
strategic ties, and you are linked with Syria by political 
relations on the ground. Do you not fear the risks of a 
collision between the two parties over the Middle East issue? 
  [Qasim] I believe that the collision assumption is wrong and 
baseless. The contrast in views on the Madrid conference is not 
new. Had collision been a possibility, it would have begun when 
the Madrid conference convened. Each of the two states 
appreciated the other state's position, convictions, and 
circumstances, so the relationship between them continued to be 
strong without being affected by what takes place in this regard. 
  I do not believe that there is a problem more sensitive than 
this one. Thus, the possibility of collision is ruled out, and 
the possibility of understanding and cooperation on common bases 
is the rule. In our relations with Iran and Syria, we do not 
feel that Iranian-Syrian relations are contradictory, and we 
feel that we are in harmony with both parties. 
  [Jallul] Many people fear that your resistance of Israel is 
meant to achieve domestic purposes. 
  [Qasim] Our resistance of Israel will give us a great asset 
among our people and kinsfolk who are yearning for the removal 
of Israel from every inch of occupied land. Thus, the outcome 
of confrontation with Israel cannot be separated from the 
repercussions on the domestic level. It is unfair to say that 
we are fighting Israel to increase our domestic weight. 
Fighting against Israel is part of our ideology, plan, and 
strategic conviction. 
  [Jallul] Will you continue to fight Israel if it withdraws 
from Lebanon? 
  [Qasim] We support the Palestinian people in defending their 
occupied territories because we regard this people as rightful. 
However, details of this support would be discussed at an 
appropriate time. 
  [Jallul] Are you negotiating with Israel on a possible 
withdrawal from southern Lebanon? 
  [Qasim] There is no need to negotiate with anyone. Israel 
can withdraw, and no one is preventing it from doing so. We do 
not want to conclude any security or political agreement with 
Israel because it is an occupying force and should withdraw from 
the territory it occupies. 
  [Jallul] In your slogans you say that "Israel is a germ" and 
should be removed from the map. Let us suppose that the 
Lebanese state and Israel would sign an agreement for withdrawal 
from southern Lebanon. Would you continue to open fire on 
Israel across the Lebanese border? 
  [Qasim] We will oppose any agreement that gives legitimacy 
to occupation which usurps lands. 
  [Jallul] In Palestine or Lebanon? 
  [Qasim] Anywhere in this occupied territory. Details on the 
way of dealing and on confrontation will be left for the future. 
  [Jallul] Is the Iranian "Revolutionary Guard" playing a role 
in the confrontation you are waging with Israel? 
  [Qasim] The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard does not 
fight in southern Lebanon. However, it is known that some of 
its members are present in the al-Biqa' area; they play an 
educational and training role and do not participate in other 
matters. This is partly due to the Islamic leadership's 
attitude and partly due to the harmony among those concerned in 
the region. 
  [Jallul] Elections of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council were 
held recently. You participated in these elections in favor of 
Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din. Your failure to nominate an 
independent candidate was interpreted to mean that you are not 
permitted to occupy posts in the official shiite institutions. 
  [Qasim] Only those things which God banned us from doing are 
prohibited. We are convinced of the need to deal with these 
institutions, and we determine the way and limits of such 
dealing according to both our goals and the objective 
circumstances. In analyzing the situation of the Shiite Islamic 
Council, we found that Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din is the 
right man for this post. You know that in such cases a person 
may be nominated but another person may be selected. There is 
nothing strange in this matter.

the two parties in the past two days. The correspondent adds 
that the incidents took place after Hizballah elements provoked 
Amal Movement elements in the village. 
  Tension also prevails in Qa'qa'iyat al-Jisr and other 
villages in the al-Nabatiyah district after Amal Movement 
elements accused Hizballah elements of killing Amal official

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In its editorial today, TISHRIN stresses that Syria 
adheres to the principle of comprehensive and speedy withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights and the occupied territories as part of a 
complete solution of all substantive issues that leads to an 
honorable, genuine, durable, and firmly established peace in the 
Middle East. 
  TISHRIN says that since the day the U.S. initiative was 
launched, Syria has declared its rejection of partial, phased 
settlements. These do not make peace, but only inflame regional 
tension. 
  TISHRIN says the issue is not just the fact that the Golan 
is 
Syrian territory occupied by force in an aggressive, 
expansionist war. There are also tens of thousands of Golan 
residents who were forced to leave their homes and who still 
await their return home. There is also the issue of the city of 
al-Qunaytirah, which was completely destroyed by the Israeli 
troops, and which awaits to be rebuilt. Therefore, it is 
impossible to talk about a peace that does not include full 
Israeli withdrawal, the return of the evacuees, and the 
reconstruction of the region. Hence, the formula proposed by 
Syria: Full peace in return for full withdrawal. Full peace 
cannot be traded for partial withdrawal. 
  TISHRIN adds: What applies to the Golan also applies to 
southern Lebanon. There are tens of thousands of displaced 
people who are anxiously awaiting the withdrawal of the invading 
Israeli troops in order to return home. 
  TISHRIN believes the Israeli rulers have a unique 
opportunity 
to engage in a durable and genuine peace. This would be through 
responding to the Syrian ideas and the resolutions of 
international legitimacy. 
  TISHRIN concludes: Israeli rulers fully know that regional 
peace is impossible without Syria's effective participation, and 
that Syria's effective participation is impossible without the 
full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan and the return 
of this Syrian territory to its owners. 
  Commenting on the same subject, AL-BA'TH says: What was 
published and said about the Israeli proposals on the Golan 
Heights during the past days, especially during Warren 
Christopher's regional tour, has proved again that Israel's 
course has nothing to do with the effort that is being exerted 
to salvage the peace process. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Vagueness is the common denominator among 
recent Israeli officials' statements on the Rabin government's 
proposals on the Golan. Therefore, their objective is to 
circumvent the principles set at the Madrid conference. 
  AL-BA'TH says those proposals which were leaked by Israel to 
coincide with the arrival of the U.S. secretary of state in the 
region have nothing to do with the issue of a just, 
comprehensive peace. At their best, just like the Gaza-Jericho 
settlement, they consolidate Israel's policy of dividing the 
political settlement and entrenching the occupation in its 
various existing forms. According to Israeli officials, such 
settlements achieve the objectives they failed to achieve in all 
their aggressive wars against the Arabs. 
  AL-BA'TH says Syria works with absolute seriousness to 
achieve a just, comprehensive peace based on the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and on the basis of the Madrid formula. 
Syria, the paper adds, believes Israel's policy on the peace 
process remains unchanged. Apparently, this policy is 
unchangeable and unalterable. This policy still rejects 
commitment to the implementation of the resolutions of 
international legitimacy. 
  AL-BA'TH refers to what leader al-Asad said during his 
meeting with Christopher, when he stressed the need to tackle 
basic issues. These issues are the essence of the conflict. 
Their solution ensures progress in the peace process. 
  Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: More than two and one-half years 
of talks in Washington, and other diplomatic efforts, have 
proved that Israel is maneuvering, procrastinating, and evading 
the implementation of the basic conditions and requirements of 
peace, chiefly full withdrawal from Arab territories. In fact, 
what Israel seeks are settlements patterned after the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. We reject such settlements. They are 
not a substitute for the aspired peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH says progress in the peace process is conditional 
on changing Israeli negotiating tactics and the commitment by 
Tel Aviv's rulers to the resolutions of international legitimacy 
and the UN Security Council and acceptance of the Madrid terms 
of reference as a basis for a just, comprehensive settlement on 
all fronts and tracks. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: So far, no one can see any substantive 
change in the negative Israeli position and performance 
regarding the political process or a single positive indicator 
of change in that policy in the near future -- a policy of 
aggressive options and continued occupation of Arab territories 
and that stubbornly rejects all the bases of peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Based on what we have noted, Tel Aviv has 
offered nothing new to facilitate the Christopher mission. 
Everything it has proposed is only ideas and proposals, which, 
according to Israeli papers themselves, are vague offers of 
phased solutions that circumvent UN resolutions and do not 
constitute a basis for a serious and genuine breakthrough in the 
peace process. 
  On the other hand, what Christopher heard from President 
Hafiz al-Asad and the ideas and proposals that he was asked to 
convey embody the constants of the Syrian position, which 
proceed from a real desire to establish a just, comprehensive 
peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH stresses that Washington is required and 
beseeched 
to play an effective, impartial role to ensure respect for and 
compliance with international legitimacy and to forcefully 
impose their implementation on the obstructive party without any 
delay and without any bias. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: It is wrong to believe Syria 
can accept any solution that does not meet its just demands or 
ignores an iota of its national and pan-Arab rights and its 
uncontroversial full sovereignty over the Golan. Piecemeal and 
phased peace is rejected and unacceptable. Peace is impossible 
without full Israeli withdrawal.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Syria's Principles," AL-THAWRAH 
says: Damascus is a primary stop on U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's current tour of the region. This is in 
view of Syria's effective role in the peace process since the 
Madrid conference, which essentially got off the ground when 
Syria agreed to take part in it, thus opening prospects for 
peace. The paper adds that despite Israel's desperate attempts 
to belittle the importance of Syria's role, all observers now 
publicly acknowledge the importance and centrality of this role. 
Observers are fully aware of the credibility of the Syrian 
stand on the peace process and the need for a comprehensive 
peace. They know that Syria has responded to the will of 
international legitimacy and the calls for implementing UN 
resolutions to establish peace and stability in the region in 
accordance with the land-for-peace formula. 
  The paper explains that, in light of Israel's intransigence 
and endeavors to turn the peace process into a series of 
partial, separate agreements and secret deals contravening the 
requirements and conditions of peace, the peace process has come 
to a dangerous impasse. The paper says that Syria has been well 
aware of Israel's deceptive methods and has dealt with them 
appropriately. Syria has also supported the efforts of the 
cosponsors of the peace initiative, especially the efforts of 
the U.S. sponsor, to get the peace process out of the bottleneck 
into which it has been pushed by the Tel Aviv rulers. 
  Stressing Syria's adherence to the prerequisites of peace, 
the paper says that Syria reaffirms the credibility of its 
stands and its acceptance of all that leads to the enforcement 
of the bases of the peace process and any efforts to advance it 
in accordance with its requirements and the hopes pinned on it. 
As leader al-Asad stressed in his meeting with the U.S. 
President in Geneva -- during which al-Asad proposed the formula 
of full peace for full withdrawal -- peace is a strategic part 
of Syria's policy. That stance won the admiration and support 
of the world and placed the ball in the Israeli court, as 
President Clinton himself put it. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says that Syria will continue to 
support just, comprehensive peace within the framework of 
international legitimacy and resolutions. Syria will never 
bargain over the Golan Heights, southern Lebanon, or other 
occupied Arab territories. Under no circumstances will Syria be 
dragged to half-solutions.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 May (MENA) -- This evening in the 
Presidential Office, President Husni Mubarak received Dr. Han 
Wan-sang, personal envoy [name and title as received] of South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who is visiting Egypt. 
  The Korean envoy said he delivered a message to President 
Mubarak from the South Korean president. He praised the 
relations linking Egypt and South Korea, noting that it is high 
time to develop these relations to the full to face up to the 
challenges following the Cold War era. 
  Touching on developments in Korea, the envoy said that ties 
of cooperation between the two Koreas could be developed if 
North Korea abandons its nuclear activity. In that case, our 
country could extend assistance to North Korea to help it become 
a full-fledged member of the international community and we 
could work together to achieve regional stability, he said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and Japanese Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa held a news conference following their 
talks at noon today. Musa said the talks dealt with many 
bilateral, regional, and international issues. They also dealt 
with the peace process and issues of concern to Asia, Africa, 
and the Arab world. The Japanese foreign minister said he was 
happy that Egypt was the first country he was visiting after the 
formation of the new Japanese Government. The visit, he said, 
comes at an important time, with the peace process witnessing 
the major development of the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli 
Agreement. He said he would be glad to attend the signing 
ceremony. 
  Kakizawa said Egypt and Japan are playing roles to help 
solve 
regional and international problems. He said today's talks were 
an important step toward boosting bilateral ties and entrenching 
the international role of the two countries. He stressed the 
importance of Egypt's African and Arab role and said Japan is 
eager to hold the necessary consultations with Egypt. 
  The Japanese foreign minister expressed regret at the 
postponement of President Mubarak's scheduled visit to Japan 
last month. He said Japan hopes the visit will take place as 
soon as possible and at the right time. He said he would meet 
President Mubarak today to tell him that Japan is willing to 
renew the invitation to his excellency to visit. 
  [In a related Cairo-datelined report, Cairo MENA in Arabic 
at 
1210 GMT on 3 May cites Dr. Yusuf Butrus Ghali, minister of 
state for international cooperation, as saying that today he 
signed two agreements with the Japanese foreign minister. Under 
the first, Japan will provide a grant of around $40 million of 
equipment to Luxor Hospital. Under the second, Japan will 
provide about the same amount as a grant to repair a tunnel. 
The minister also said that in a step reflecting Japan's 
confidence in Egypt's economic reform program, "the Japanese 
foreign minister also announced that Japan would guarantee 
Japanese investments in Egypt."]

<F P=106> [Report by Midhat al-Zahid, Sami Fahmi, and Hazim Munir] </F>
  [Text] AL-AHALI has obtained important information that 
explains the background of the attempt to involve Egypt's Copts 
in a conference on minorities in the Arab world and also exposes 
the schemes behind such conferences. 
  An informed Egyptian source has confirmed that U.S. 
diplomats 
have been persistently exerting pressure over the past few 
months during several meetings with Egyptian officials in Cairo 
and Washington to form a new committee in the People's Assembly 
to deal with human rights. The source said that the discussions 
revealed that the notion goes beyond the concept of human rights 
to what the Americans term the protection of the minorities' 
right to hold religious rites and to protect religious freedom 
in Egypt. 
  Egyptian officials rejected the U.S. ideas because of their 
inherent dangers threatening the Egyptian people's single 
national fabric and the sectarian seditions they might inflame, 
particularly since religious rights in Egypt are already 
protected and waves of terrorism and bigotry are threatening all 
Egyptians without exception. 
  Groups in the United States have tried to exploit the Dayr 
al- Muharraq incident in an attempt to incite international 
public opinion against what they termed the persecution campaign 
against Copts in Egypt and to demand international protection 
for the Copts on the pretext that the government is not 
protecting them and not bringing those who attack them to trial. 
Coptic leaders in Egypt have rejected these attempts and His 
Holiness Pope Shanudah III issued a statement stressing that 
Egypt's Copts are not a minority and he does not want any party 
to label them as such. He said that the Copts are part of 
Egypt's national fabric. In an interview with AL-AHALI, the 
pope stressed that the cohesiveness of the homeland's sons is a 
guarantee of stability against terrorism. 
  The crisis resulting from the minority rights conference -- 
which the Ibn-Khaldun Center for Development Studies is 
organizing in cooperation with the London-based International 
Society for the Protection of Minorities' Rights -- continues to 
create problems. The Sudanese and Iraqi governments have told 
the Arab League, through private channels, that they are opposed 
to discussing the problems of the Kurds and south Sudan at the 
international conference scheduled to be held in Cairo next 
month while the international coalition forces are undertaking 
what they term the protection of Kurds in northern Iraq. This 
undertaking in fact threatens Iraq's territorial integrity, 
while the Iraqi people remain under siege. 
  Khartoum has also protested the presence of John Garang in 
Cairo and the discussion of the south Sudan issue at an 
international conference. 
  In a last attempt to save the minority rights conference, 
Dr. 
Sa'd-al-Din Ibrahim announced that the issue of Egypt's Copts 
has been removed from the agenda and that the conference will be 
amended by adding peoples' rights to minority rights. 
  According to AL-AHALI's information, UN Secretary General 
Dr. 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd- al-Majid, and Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa will 
not, as previously announced, attend the conference or send 
messages to it. AL-AHALI's information also confirms that many 
of those invited to attend have turned down invitations to 
attend, send papers, or participate in its sessions.

<F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said Jordan 
was not boycotting Middle East multilateral peace [talks] but 
rather lowering the level of participation in the talks. Dr. 
Al-Majali said the decision will continue until the situation on 
the ground changes with regards to Western interception of 
al-'Aqabah-bound vessels. 
  The prime minister told The News at Ten that Jordan would 
attend tomorrow's signing of the PLO-Israeli agreement, adding 
that the agreement was not coordinated with Jordan. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Majali] We have told our foreign 
minister [title as heard] and our ambassador in Egypt to attend 
the meeting, which is going to take place tomorrow. 
  [Correspondent al-Sha'ir] Did the PLO coordinate with Jordan 
with respect to the signing tomorrow? 
  [Al-Majali] Not really. We did not receive anything from 
the PLO side, but we received from Egypt an invitation to 
attend, and we hope that it will be a very successful one. 
  [Al-Sha'ir] Jordan is going to send an observer to Doha for 
the multilateral talks. Does this mean that Jordan still is 
going to avoid the peace process? 
  [Al-Majali] Don't use the word observer. He is not an 
observer; he is a member of the delegation, but he is a single 
person to attend, and he will be attending, and in fact he has 
been there for a few days to talk even preliminarily before the 
general meeting. But he is not going to participate in the same 
way like in the old days because, still, we are not sure whether 
the issue of al-'Aqabah has been settled completely. Still, I 
think, it is in its final stages, so everything will be okay 
after that. 
  [Al-Sha'ir] So, until a decision is taken, Jordan... 
  [Al-Majali, interrupting] We are just joining. We are 
attending. We are not boycotting. We're just lowering the 
level of the participation itself, which is because of the 
economic reasons. Multilateral is for economic reasons. We 
cannot be punished economically and in the same time attend 
something in the economic side and in the regional side. [end 
recording] 
  Dr. Al-Majali was speaking after a meeting with Egyptian 
journalists visiting Amman to cover Thursday's meetings of the 
Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Committee. The prime minister 
expressed hope that the meeting will be a basic tool to 
reestablish Arab solidarity and upgrade coordination between 
Cairo and Amman. Dr. al-Majali called for a grace period in 
discussing Arab differences, and allowing time to heal existing 
rifts. 
  He told the Egyptian journalists that while Jordan 
recognizes 
the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian 
people, it does not want any agreement by the PLO to have 
negative consequences on Jordan.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordan on Tuesday [3 May] dispatched its 
State Minister for Foreign Affairs Talal al-Hasan to Cairo to 
attend Wednesday's signing of the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO)-Israel self-rule agreement after visible 
hesitation and an earlier decision to boycott the ceremony. 
  Informed sources said Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali 
on Tuesday gained support for his argument to send a top-level 
Jordanian representative to the signing ceremony despite 
Jordanian dismay at the lack of PLO coordination with Jordan and 
the continuing naval blockade on al-'Aqabah. 
  The decision, which seemed to have been a compromise between 
sending a more senior-level delegation or dispatching no 
representative at all, was taken by the Cabinet at its regular 
meeting yesterday. 
  "President Husni Mubarak had personally invited His Majesty 
to attend the ceremony and this invitation was declined," said a 
well-informed source. Another source said that the King had 
excused himself by pointing to the 40 days of mourning at the 
Royal Court over the passing of Her Majesty Queen Zayn al-Sharaf. 
  Egypt later extended another invitation to the prime 
minister 
and the minister of state for foreign affairs to attend the 
cermeonies, but this suggestion was also turned down, with 
Jordan opting finally for sending the minister of state. 
  A senior Jordanian official told the JORDAN TIMES on Monday 
that Jordan had sent a letter regetting that it would not be 
able to attend the ceremony. A PLO official also confirmed that 
the organisation had received a negative reply from the Kingdom. 
  It was not immediately clear what caused the change of heart 
between late Monday and Tuesday. According to well-informed 
sources, Dr. al-Majali himself was arguing for a Jordanian 
representation at the ceremony, especially that 43 other foreign 
ministers from around the world were scheduled to attend. 
  Jordan had intended to use the occasion to register its 
growing displeasure at the low level of coordination by the PLO 
with Jordan over decisions that ultimately affect vital 
Jordanian interests. 
  The Kingdom also believed that attending the meeting would 
contradict a vow to suspend its active role in Middle East peace 
negotiations until it finalised an agreement with Washington 
whereby inspections of vessels heading to al-'Aqabah would be 
conducted by Lloyds Register of London. 
  Dr. al-Majali, according to the sources, had argued that 
with 
43 foreign ministers attending the signing ceremony "Jordan's 
presence can be treated like that of any of these countries." 
  According to the sources, the premier also believed that 
Jordan's absence would cause "more embarassement for the Kingdom 
than would serve its purpose." 
  Other sources said that at least one other factor figured in 
the decision of the government to attend the Cairo meeting. 
After several delays the Joint Egyptian-Jordanian Higher 
Committee was scheduled to begin talks here Thursday headed by 
Egyptian Prime Minister Atif Sidqi and Dr. al-Majali. 
  "If only to show good will to this scheduled meeting, Jordan 
probably could not have boycotted a ceremony hosted by Egypt," a 
well-informed analyst said. 
  PLO sources also said Tuesday that the organisation had 
insisted on Jordanian attendance till the time the decision was 
taken by the Cabinet and that the PLO would have liked Jordan's 
prime minister to be present at the signing ceremony.

  [Text] Replying to a question by the Jordanian News Agency 
on the signing ceremony of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement in 
Cairo today, Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and acting 
information minister, said the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan 
recognizes the PLO as the sole, legitimate representative of the 
Palestinian people in accordance with the 1974 Rabat Arab summit 
conference resolution, which was approved unanimously and upon a 
Palestinian request. Hence, he added, the kingdom considers the 
signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement today an 
independent Palestinian affair. We support the Palestinian 
people's rights and stand by their side with all our abilities. 
In the meantime, he said, Jordan hopes this agreement will be a 
basic step in the fraternal Palestinian people's struggle for 
the establishment of their independent state on the land of 
Palestine. 
  He added that the special, distinctive Jordanian-Palestinian 
relations in the past, present, and future presume, among other 
things, the continuation of the highest possible level of 
cooperation and coordination for the good of the two fraternal 
peoples and their joint national and pan-Arab interest.

  [Text] Barring further obstacles Yitzhaq Rabin's 
government may create at the eleventh hour to block the 
agreement launching Palestinian self-rule, Cairo will today 
witness the signing ceremony and the agreement will go into 
effect immediately. 
  If we are skeptical about the signing, it is because as the 
date approaches, Israel has been trying to blackmail the 
Palestinian side into making further concessions. Israel may 
even seek to renege on certain points it agreed to with the 
Palestinians in the tough negotiations they have conducted over 
the past weeks. 
  In any case, assuming things proceed as planned, today 
should 
be marked as a milestone in the history of the Palestinian 
people, who have paid a heavy price to unblock the road to their 
legitimate national rights and win their freedom and 
independence. 
  Granted, this agreement falls short of the Palestinian 
people's aspirations and inalienable rights. Notwithstanding 
its inadequacies, the agreement could in the long run prove a 
major step down a long road to freeing the land and getting rid 
of occupation and rebuilding the Palestinian entity. 
  Hopefully, no last-minute obstacles raised by Israel will 
block the signing ceremony. It is also hoped the agreement will 
constitute a fresh stimulus for the Palestinian people's 
struggle. The brother Palestinians owe it to themselves to make 
the most of this significant accomplishment and go on to score 
further successes so that, eventually, they attain their 
freedom, advancement, and independence.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Coming to Grips With Challenges"] </F>
  [Text] The prime minister's remarks to Egyptian media 
representatives, in Amman to report on the proceedings of the 
Higher Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Committee, is significant in 
more ways than one. The prime minister's statements addressed 
his Egyptian counterpart's visit to Jordan and the higher 
committee's work. Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali also noted the 
high regard in which Jordan holds its political relations and 
coordination with Egypt at this sensitive stage. 
  Jordan has consistently exerted itself on behalf of 
revitalizing Arab solidarity and common Arab action. Hence the 
prime minister's observation that while the Arab world is going 
through a delicate stage and a rapid succession of developments, 
certain Arab parties handle their differences as if they do not 
appreciate the gravity of the situation. There has been an 
absence of real attempts to smooth over Arab differences so as 
to take account of global changes from a pan-Arab outlook and 
tackle the challenges facing the Arab nation. 
  Unless they get their act together and iron out their 
differences, the Arabs will be made to stomach a regional order 
under the new world order that will shape their lives for many 
years to come. In order for the Arabs to avert such a 
likelihood, the prime minister suggested that they approach 
their differences as if they were debts to be rescheduled over, 
say, a 10-year period with a three-year grace period, during 
which time the parties pause to think over these differences. 
  Jordan appreciates the critical circumstances the Arab world 
is experiencing and is equally aware of the political and 
economic implications of these circumstances. Jordan knows full 
well that if the Arabs intend to advance their interests and 
ward off dangers, they have to close ranks and revert to 
effective action based on new and clear rules that respond to 
ongoing and rapid changes sweeping the world. To quote the 
prime minister, there is no place for spectators under the new 
world order, in which the Arabs have to play an active and 
effectual role.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali met with 
Egyptian media representatives and delegates at the Prime 
Ministry today. These media men came to Jordan in order to 
report on the meetings of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian 
Committee. During the meeting, the prime minister discussed 
bilateral relations and the regional situation. Here are more 
details: 
  Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali welcomed the 
resumption of the meetings of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian 
Committee. He said: We hope these meetings will be a 
foundation stone for reinstating work among the Arab states in 
the required way. He also pointed out the importance of 
coordination between the two fraternal countries, particularly 
in this phase. 
  The prime minister explained that the agenda of the meetings 
includes many issues and topics, led by consolidating political 
relations between the sisterly countries and discussing a number 
of economic issues, such as exports, protocols, dealing with 
trucks, transportation, the Arab bridge, and electric power 
connection. 
  Dr. al-Majali said that the Arab world is now passing 
through 
a crucial stage, that facts and events are accelerating rapidly, 
and that the Arab world is still unaware of the serious phase we 
are passing through because it is still dealing, to a limited 
degree, with the reasons for differences, but no genuine 
attempts have been made to remove these differences and deal 
with the new facts. 
  Al-Majali added that the real features of the new world 
order 
have not yet become clear, except for the fact that the United 
States is the country that is currently dominating this order. 
He noted that the character of the regional order that could 
prevail in our region has not yet become clear. The prime 
minister asserted that if the Arabs do not act before it is too 
late, do not reach understanding, and do not achieve accord, a 
regional order could be arranged and imposed on them. Such an 
order could affect the Arabs for a long period of time. 
  Al-Majali asserted that there is no room for spectators in 
such an order, and that we, the Arabs, should play an effective 
and influential role in this order. 
  The prime minister reviewed the siege imposed on the port of 
al-'Aqabah and the efforts that the Jordanian king and 
government have made to resolve this issue, as a result of which 
Jordan has sustained great financial losses that reflected 
negatively on the performance of the Jordanian economy. He said 
that since the meeting held between His Majesty King Husayn and 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in London last week 
no ship bound for al-'Aqabah has been intercepted. He added 
that the Jordanian proposal that the international company 
Lloyds supervise the dealings with cargo bound for the port of 
al-'Aqabah was approved. Al-Majali explained that some matters 
pertaining to this issue are still being studied.

  [Text] Amman--A responsible Jordanian source has stressed 
Jordan's rejection of any agreement with Lloyds Register that 
encroaches on Jordan's sovereignty over its territory and its 
right to inspect incoming ships. 
  In statements to the press, the source said that Jordan 
insists on not giving Lloyds Register the right to inspect ships 
and that this international company's duty is to carry out 
inspections at the docks in the Port of al-'Aqabah and to allow 
or disallow any imported goods into the country. 
  The source noted that the cost of the inspections, which 
could reach $3 million dollars per year, is not Jordan's 
responsibility. This is because the inspection procedure was not 
imposed by Jordan but by the United Nations, which, therefore, 
should cover the inspection costs. However, an agreement on 
this issue could be reached later. 
  The source said that Jordan rejects the stationing of 
international forces to supervise the work of the international 
company and also rejects the presence of international observers 
at the Port of al-'Aqabah. Some international sources have 
called for this in order to secure direct international 
supervision over the inspection operations. According to them, 
these operations are being conducted by a civil rather than an 
international authority and an international presence alongside 
this civilian authority is required. 
  Diplomatic sources in Amman said that inspections at the 
Port 
of al-'Aqabah's docks will create many problems for Jordan. 
These sources believe that inspections at the Port of 
al-'Aqabah will not take place because the United Nations cannot 
totally delegate UN Security Council duties to an international 
company. 
  These sources noted that, during the press conference with 
His Majesty King Husayn after agreeing to delegate Lloyds 
Register to carry out the inspections, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher reiterated twice that through this agreement, 
the embargo on Iraq will become more effective. 
  The sources added that the U.S. secretary meant that the 
inspections that were carried out at sea, sometimes in a random 
and inaccurate manner, will now be carried out at the docks of 
the port and cover each and every piece of imported goods under 
UN supervision, which would require the stationing of an 
international force at the port or at least one international 
officer or observer with permanent residency in Jordanian 
territory. 
  The sources said that the Jordanian-U.S. agreement does not 
seem practical and that it will reignite Jordanian-U.S. 
differences once implementation begins.

  [Text] Amman--Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali said 
Tuesday [3 May] no Jordan-bound ship was intercepted by the 
enforcers of the sanctions against Iraq after the April 25 
meeting between His Majesty King Husayn and U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher in London. 
  During that meeting, Mr. Christopher announced that subject 
to "some fine-tuning" Washington was accepting Jordan's proposal 
to replace the sea-based inspections by American-led warships 
with an on-shore sanctions verifications regime. 
  Dr. al-Majali, in a meeting with Egyptian reporters ahead of 
Thursday's meeting here of the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher 
Committee, said that despite the acceptance announced by Mr. 
Christopher no further steps had been taken to place the 
sanctions-verifications regime at al-'Aqabah. 
  The fact that no ship was intercepted after the London 
meeting does not automatically mean that the inspectors have 
called off the maritime interceptions, Dr. al-Majali said. 
  At the same time, Dr. al-Majali reaffirmed Jordan's position 
that it would not allow any "inspection" of cargo at al-'Aqabah. 
Lloyds Register, the international neutral agency nominated to 
take over the sanctions-verification regime, was free to 
"observe" incoming and outgoing cargo at al-'Aqabah when 
Jordanian customs inspectors open them as required by the 
Kingdom's laws and regulations, he said. 
  The agency, he said, could report to the U.N. Sanctions 
Committee on its observations. Beyond that, Dr. al-Majali 
added, Jordan would not accept any arrangement that would 
infringe upon its sovereignty. 
  In his comments to the Egyptian journalists, Dr. al-Majali 
welcomed the resumption of meetings of the joint 
Jordanian-Egyptian committee and expressed hope that the meeting 
would lay the cornerstone for restoring Arab cooperation and 
coordination. 
  He said that the committee will also discuss means to 
bolster 
political relations. 
  The prime minister underlined the need for ending inter-Arab 
differences and "to open a new chapter, particularly at this 
criticial stage..." 
  Dr. al-Majali said it was essential that the Arabs assume an 
effective role in any regional order. 
  He said features of the "new world order" were not yet clear 
enough, nor are those of the regional Arab order. 
  "The only clear thing is that the United States is 
dominating 
the world under the new order," he added. 
  Dr. al-Majali said "There is no room under the new order for 
spectators" and emphasised the need for effective Arab input in 
shaping this order. 
  Dr. al-Majali said Jordan's participation in the 
multilateral 
peace talks has been reduced to an observer status to protest 
the continued blockade of al-'Aqabah port. He noted that 
multilateral talks are meant to address economic and social 
problems. 
  On the Palestinian-Israeli accord, Dr. al-Majali said what 
was taking place between the Palestinian and Israelis was an 
affair concerning the two parties. 
  "We shall accept what the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
(PLO), the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian 
people, accepts," he said. "However, we do not want the result 
of any accord to negatively affect us." 
  He added that Jordan had hoped for greater 
Jordanian-Palestinian coordination, given the unique brotherly, 
historical relations between the two peoples.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has reiterated Jordan's 
commitment to the peace process. Jordan is looking for a viable 
peace under a state of affairs different from what has prevailed 
so far. We have to band together as never before to cope with 
all eventualities, his majesty said. We have been under 
sustained pressure, not least due to our advocacy of democracy, 
shura, and the individual's right to help fashion his future. 
In our opinion, this is the only road to stability and Arab 
strength. 
  Interviewed by the Paris-based magazine AL-SIYSAH 
AL-DUWALIYAH, his majesty said that, God willing, Jordan and 
Jordanians shall keep their heads held high and will never bow, 
except to God. We must brace for further pressure, his majesty 
said. 
  His majesty said we in Jordan are determined to preserve the 
unity of all the components of our large family . We mean to 
keep our march moving on the lines of the National Charter, the 
Constitution, democracy, shura, and respect for human rights. 
His majesty said he was worried by the lack of coordination 
among Arab parties, given the state of inter-Arab affairs, which 
lessens our chances of attaining the desired settlement. 
  Israel, he said, has failed to fulfill its duties, and must, 
as an occupying power, be held responsible for a string of 
events, including the burning of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the 
transgressions on Christian holy places. I will do the 
impossible, his majesty said, to make sure that that Jordan 
remains a beacon for the larger Arab world and continues to 
fulfill its role and duty.

Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] have declared tomorrow, 
Wednesday, a day of national mourning and have asked the people 
of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to observe a general 
strike. 
  In a statement distributed in the occupied territories 
today, 
the two fronts said that the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement will constitute one of the most dangerous and 
difficult periods in the Palestinian people's struggle because 
complete coordination now exists between the Palestinian side 
and the occupation forces, as the statement put it. [passage

  [Text] Damascus, 3 May (AFP)--The radical Islamic 
Resistance Movement Hamas said Tuesday [3 May] it was not bound 
by agreements between Israel and the PLO. 
  In a statement to AFP here, Hamas denounced the self-rule 
deal for Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank town of Jericho, which is due to be signed Wednesday in 
Cairo. 
  The accord was "contrary to the wishes of the Palestinian 
people," the statement said. 
  Hamas, which has its stronghold within the occupied 
territories, has claimed two recent suicide bombing attacks 
within Israel in which 13 Israelis were killed. 
  The statement also rejected an accord on the future economic 
relations between the two sides signed in Paris on April 29, 
saying it was the start of "Zionist hegemony in the region."

<F P=106> [Report by Mufid 'Awwad: "Ghawshah Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F>
No Agreements Between Hamas and Fatah; We Are Facing Pressures 
in Jordan and Britain"] 
  [Text] Amman -- Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official 
spokesman for the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), has 
accused Fatah and Yasir 'Arafat's leadership in Tunis of 
"launching a misleading information campaign about political 
dialogues between the two movements with the aim of peddling the 
autonomy agreement." 
  He denied any agreements or meetings with Fatah other than 
the field agreement in the occupied Gaza Strip to prevent any 
tension between the Fatah Hawks and and the 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam Battalions. 
  Ghawshah reaffirmed Hamas' rejection of autonomy and refusal 
to participate in the elections but emphasized that it is very 
much opposed to any Palestinian infighting. He denied the 
arrest of any of its members in Jordan but admitted that the 
movement is facing pressures in the Jordanian, British, and 
American arenas. 
  This was in an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the first 
by 
Ghawshah or any Hamas official for over two weeks since they 
stopped making statements after the pressures which followed 
recent operations in the occupied territory. 
  On the claims about a meeting between Hamas and Fatah in 
Cairo under the auspices of the Muslim Brotherhood there, he 
said that these were fabricated, unfounded reports and that the 
field meetings held in Rafah were for the purpose of tackling 
the issue of mutual kidnapping by the military organizations of 
the two movements to prevent the recurrence of such incidents 
and prevent any provocations or clashes. 
  He added that, as a result of that and following the 
large-scale arrest by Israel of Hamas members -- reaching 3,000 
-- after the 'Afula and al-Khudayrah operations, and following 
the pressure brought to bear on Hamas in several areas, 
especially in Jordan, the PLO's leadership, Yasir 'Arafat's 
leadership in Tunis, through its information organs, tried to 
spread these reports about political dialogues and claims that 
Hamas wants a place in the autonomy authority. 
  He said that Hamas has stopped its political dialogues with 
'Arafat and the PLO leadership since 13 September 1993 when the 
Oslo agreement was signed. He revealed that Hamas rejected Arab 
mediation for the revival of dialogue between Hamas and 'Arafat 
and his leadership. He reaffirmed that that is still the Hamas 
position on that issue. 
  The Hamas spokesman urged the Palestinian police to play a 
patriotic role by defending the Palestinian people against the 
aggression of Israeli soldiers and settlers. He also said that 
the release of the Palestinian detainees from enemy prisons is a 
sensitive matter. He warned that the release of 5,000 
supporters of the Oslo agreement and the failure to release 
5,000 Hamas supporters and opponents of the agreement would 
cause a major crack in the Palestinian society. He rejected 
ideological discrimination as a basis for the release of 
prisoners because that would be blackmail. He drew attention to 
the "cunning Israeli link between the release of detainees and 
full amnesty for those who collaborate with Israel." He said 
that "the traitors must be punished." 
  Ghawshah said that his movement will maintain its 
information 
activity in Jordan on the grounds that Hamas' role [there] is 
informational and political and has nothing to do with the jihad 
military operations in Palestine because such operations are 
fully planned and carried out internally. He said that the role 
of the symbols and spokesmen of Hamas is to express daily 
political and informational positions within the current laws of 
any state they may be in.

  AL-MANAR has learned that all the members of the National 
Authority are supporters of the peace process and the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 26 April 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Muslim Brotherhood Figure Reflects on Police-Islamists 
War 
  2. Chief Editor Vows To Keep Up War Against Corruption 
  3. Al-Ghazali on Israel's Economic Supremacy 
  4. Islamist on Human Rights Violations in Jails 
  5. Editorial Calls For Driving Out Foreign Forces From 
Sinai 
  6. Opinion Poll Shows Shari'ah Can Cure Armed Violence 
  7. War Against Corruption 
<H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD FIGURE REFLECTS ON POLICE-ISLAMISTS WAR </H5>
  In a 3,000-word article on page 5, Muslim Brotherhood figure 
Dr. Ahmad al-Malat reflects on the "quagmire of bloodletting on 
the good Egyptian soil," between policemen who carry out 
officials' orders and young people who went astray. He remarks 
that: "The greatest disaster ever is that the bloodletting 
persists in the form of mutual vendetta, continuing executions, 
indiscriminate killing that makes no distinction between the 
innocent and the guilty, and the insistence on violence as the 
only approach against both policemen and young Islamists." 
  Although we are pleased to see the policemen doing their 
noble duty of safeguarding the homeland's and the citizen's 
peace, we certainly disagree with them on the way they perform 
this duty because man is entitled to certain rights that should 
be preserved, he says. To explain this, he states that "mass 
arrests that make no distinction between the innocent and the 
guilty are prohibited and torturing and humiliating them is 
prohibited." He adds that mere suspicion does not provide 
enough justification for the police to do whatever they want 
unless they rely on that "repulsive emergency law, for which 
there is no equal in terms of cruelty, severity, and longevity 
elsewhere, except in this afflicted country." 
  Referring sarcastically to the 23 July 1952 revolution and 
its leader, Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir, he says: "Dead and buried, the 
so-called blessed revolution has left the Egyptian people a 
heritage of humiliation and denigration, forcing them to walk in 
the shadow of the sole, inspired ruler and to worship in his 
temple rather than in the mosque of Islam." 
  Al-Malat contends that "certain police groups" have 
committed 
themselves to fighting anything Islamic in nature. He notes 
that Muslim Brotherhood founder Imam Hasan al-Banna was 
assassinated by the guards of King Faruq of Egypt. 
  He cites an interview with a former interior minister's 
assistant, which the magazine LIWA' AL-ISLAMI published in its 
April edition, in which he talks about police violence during 
interrogations. 
  Moving to another point, al-Malat states that a "fierce war 
was launched against preachers" for fear that they might refute 
secularist claims. Some of the victims of that war, he says, 
were Shaykh Kishk, Shaykh Ahmad al-Mahallawi, and Shaykh 'Umar 
'abd-al-Kafi. He says that the police silenced hundreds of 
those preachers and replaced them with men who do not even read 
the Koran properly. 
  Promising the "second part" of his article on Tuesday, 3 
May, 
al-Malat concludes with the Koranic verse 2-114: "And who is 
more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship 
of God, God's name should be celebrated? Whose zeal is to ruin 
them? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them 
except in fear. For them there is nothing but disgrace in this 
world, and in the world to come an exceeding torment." 
<H5>  CHIEF EDITOR VOWS TO KEEP UP WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION </H5>
  The newspaper's chief editor, Majdi Ahmad Husayn, writes in 
his 2,000-word article on page 5 that "official complaints 
against AL-SHA'B continue in an obvious attempt to dissuade it 
from keeping up its determined line to fight corruption." He 
vows that the paper will not shift an inch from its position in 
spite of the scores of interrogations and the four cases filed 
against it. "It has become clear to all that it is not a matter 
of slander or defamation on the paper's part, but an attempt to 
silence every free and candid voice," he says. 
  Noting the complaint the chairman of the Suez Canal 
Authority 
filed against the paper, he says that the authority chairman 
does not care about the billions of pounds the authority loses 
every year through human error, mismanagement, and fraud and 
only wants to defend himself and silence AL-SHA'B. 
  Citing the Japanese and U.S. experience, Husayn stresses 
that 
issues involving public funds should be discussed in public. 
  In conclusion, he writes: "There is no time for playing 
games. If this nation is to be rescued from its ordeal, the 
heads of corruption must be amputated and society must be 
cleansed. To do that, we have to pay the price and make 
sacrifices." 

<H5>    AL-GHAZALI ON ISRAEL'S ECONOMIC SUPREMACY </H5>
  In his 400-word column on page 12, Muhammad al-Ghazali 
quotes 
Israel's founder, Ben-Gurion, as vowing that Israel would 
conquer Arab states with military supremacy, and if that was not 
possible it would conquer them with economic supremacy. He 
states that "Solomon's jinns" work around the clock to perfect 
the peace and war industry and that their products have invaded 
world markets. He admits that the Israeli skill in civilian and 
military production is not surprising because the plan to set up 
greater Israel is based on "a hardworking people who sweat in 
the field while neighboring, smooth-handed people indulge in 
luxury and their young men are deprived of firm religious 
guidance." 
  Al-Ghazali notes that the Jewish experience in highly 
productive farming is being offered to Egypt, a country that has 
farmed the land for 50 centuries and to which the Jews fled tens 
of centuries ago to escape poverty and famine. He wonders what 
has happened to Arabs and Egypt to make them fail to exploit 
their lands and double their wealth. He affirms that the 
Egyptian youth are idle wealth and paralyzed talent who could 
surpass Jews if they were given the chance. He notes that 
deserting Islam has led to all this. 
  Noting the killing of 16 "fundamentalists" near an Arab 
capital, he says: "We are only strong when we fight among 
ourselves as we compete for worldly luxury. But the distance is 
long between us and God's book and his prophet's tradition." 
<H5>  ISLAMIST ON HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN JAILS </H5>
  Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus' 500-word column on page 12 states 
that the "violation of human rights is the major defect in Husni 
Mubarak's regime," which commits the most despicable acts 
against inmates in the al-'Aqrab, the scorpion, jail south of 
Cairo. 
  He affirms that inmates in that prison are held in cells 
resembling cemetries and that they never see the sun. He adds 
that visits by family members, newspapers, letters, sports, 
bathing, airing of blankets, and going out of the cells are 
prohibited in that place. On top of all that, inmates are 
regularly insulted and humiliated, he adds, noting that this 
prison is a mark of disgrace on the regime. He finally calls on 
the authorities to wake up before it is too late. 
<H5>  EDITORIAL CALLS FOR DRIVING OUT FOREIGN FORCES FROM SINAI </H5>
  A 400-word editorial on page 1 commemorates the 12th 
anniversary of Sinai's liberation and notes that U.S. forces, 
"better known as the multinational forces," are still present in 
Sinai. The editorial asks when these forces will leave and 
calls on all national powers to drive these forces out of Sinai. 
It calls on the government to use the Armed Forces to exploit 
the area. 
<H5>  OPINION POLL SHOWS SHARI'AH CAN CURE ARMED VIOLENCE </H5>
  A 200-word report by Ahmad al-Siyufi on page 1 says that an 
opinion poll on armed violence conducted by the National 
Dialogue Committee at Asyut University has shown that 62.27 
percent of university professors attribute violence to economic 
and social causes, widespread corruption, the conduct of the 
security forces, and insufficient religious education. The 
report says that 37.8 percent of professors attribute violence 
to foreign elements. 
  The poll showed that 73.4 percent believe that the 
application of shari'ah is the right cure for violence. 
  Asked about the causes of sectarian strife, 31.9 percent 
said 
the cause was foreign elements, 35 percent said it was the 
incorrect understanding of religion, 8.4 percent said it was the 
feeling of being persecuted, and 24.7 said it was the failure to 
apply shari'ah. 
  The poll showed that 88 percent of professors believe that 
the existing parliamentary institutions do not represent the 
people properly, while 5.7 percent believe they do. 
<H5>  WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION </H5>
  A 2,000-word report by 'Imad Mahjub on page 2 cites a report 
by the Central Accounting Organization on the abuse of public 
funds in Aswan Governorate, where a total of 635,249 pounds of 
the governorate's budget and the local development fund were 
spent on "guests" between January 1992 and May 1993. 
  The report claims that Aswan Governor Salah Misbah used the 
development fund to buy gifts and entertain and accommodate 
guests at five-star hotels. The prime minister's private 
secretary was among these guests. Her birthday party at the 
Cataract Hotel in February and her golden birthday gift were 
financed by public funds. Other "guests" are mentioned in the 
report. 
  A 3,000-word report by Sha'ban 'Abd-al-Rahman on page 2 
gives 
an account of the "crimes" AL-SHA'B reporters have been accused 
of committing against the Suez Canal Authority and its chairman. 
Of these, he cites reports published earlier about violations 
in the Suez Canal expansion project, the electric control 
project, and the shipyard project. He promises to submit 
documents proving these violations to the attorney general. 
  A 1,500-word report by 'Ali al-Qammash on page 3 writes 
about 
Nabil Mishriqi, better known in the press as Madinat al-Nasr 
Shark, who is getting special treatment in jail. He wears 
civilian clothes, strolls freely around the court, and even runs 
his business from his "five-star" prison cell. 
  A 2,000-word report by 'Amir 'Id on page 3 writes about 
corruption in the North Alexandria Mills Company. 
  A 1,500-word report by Mahmud Bakri on page 3 deals with 
"big 
sharks" who seized 45,000 feddans [1.038 acres] of the most 
fertile arable land with the help of officials.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 29 April 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Israel's Rabin Seeks Russian Accord Against Islamic 
Movements 
  2. Asyut Residents Criticize Police Handling of Islamic 
Groups 
  3. Sudanese Vice President, Others Address Islamic

  4. Party Official Attacks Regime, Notes `Islamic Solution'

<H5>  ISRAEL'S RABIN SEEKS RUSSIAN ACCORD AGAINST ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS </H5>
  In an approximately 140-word front-page report by Mahmud 
Bakri under the heading "U.S.-Russian-Israeli Agreement To 
Confront the Islamists," AL-SHA'B claims to have learned that 
Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's talks in Russia dealt with an 
agreement to confront the "growing" Islamic movements in the 
region. Information indicates, Bakri adds, that there is an 
intention to sign a strategic agreement between Israeli and 
Russian intelligence services in this regard, the first such 
accord between the two countries. Bakri states: "The 
information confirms that the Israeli proposals in this respect 
include one about finding a formula for tripartite cooperation 
involving Russia, Israel, and the United States within an 
integrated plan called "Handling Security in the Middle East." 
  The plan stipulates a tripartite cooperation based on 
halting 
all forms of agreement and military engagement between Russia 
and the Arab countries for fear that some Islamic trends may 
gain control over the sources of some of these weapons. 
  Bakri notes that the plan also provides for penetrating the 
security of some religious institutions and calls for interest 
in the role of research and information. The author concludes 
by saying that the tripartite plan's details are not yet clear 
but the U.S. side approved it earlier. 
<H5>  ASYUT RESIDENTS CRITICIZE POLICE HANDLING OF ISLAMIC GROUPS </H5>
  A 180-word front-page report by Jahal Imbabi says that Asyut 
residents have denounced police excesses against the population, 
the violation of human rights, mass punishment, random shooting, 
and the wounding of innocent people. In interviews with 
AL-SHA'B, the report adds, people from various part of Asyut 
affirm that the police have handled the Islamic Group's 
"excesses" with their own "excess" against the population, which 
paid for "both sides' mistakes." 
  Imbabi claims the residents also criticized the state media 
policy and pointed out that undermining the legitimate parties, 
violating the trade unions, weakening al-Azhar's role, and 
rigging elections have found the youths lose hope in change 
through the ballot box. 
<H5>  SUDANESE VICE PRESIDENT, OTHERS ADDRESS ISLAMIC CONFERENCE </H5>
  In an approximately 1,000-word report on pages 1 and 7 by 
Qutb al-Arabi from Khartoum on the opening of the 14th session 
of the Islamic Propagation Organization [IPO], the paper says 
the Sudanese vice president, Major General al-Zubayr Muhammad 
Salih, the chairman of the IPO Board of Trustees, Marshal 
'Abd-al-Rahman Siwar-al-Dhahab, and Qatari Shari'ah College Dean 
Yusuf al-Qardawi addressed the delegates. 
  In his speech, the Sudanese vice president defended the 
Sudanese Government and Islam, saying: "The Sudanese Government 
has devoted itself to God in defense of Islam and the oppressed 
everywhere. The threats of the United States and the West do 
not frighten us because God is with us. We will not submit to 
the enemies of Islam and there will be no concessions on any of 
God's commandments unless it is over our dead bodies." 
  He gave his "assurance" to the Islamic nation that the 
Islamic regime in Sudan is "firm and able to confront the 
Islamic nation's enemies." He said: "We are a peaceful nation, 
do not wish to fight anyone, and have nothing to do with 
terrorism. But we have truly revived the spirit of jihad in the 
Sudanese people so that they can be vigilant and can defend 
themselves against any potential aggression." 
  In his address, the IPO official denounced the "world order 
that is hostile to Muslims." He noted that UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali halted a NATO decision to attack the Serbs in 
Gorazde because a British soldier had to be moved from there. 
Thus the UN secretary general was "concerned about one British 
soldier, yet did not care about 70,000 Muslim men and women 
besieged in Gorazde." 
  Defending the Sudanese Government and its Islamic policy, 
the 
Qatari Shari'ah College dean addressed the conference, saying 
Sudan will not bow and will only kneel before God. He added 
that Sudan will offer a great deal to the shari'ah so that it 
can live a "sound Islamic life." The author notes that the 
mufti of Albania was among those who addressed the inaugural 
session. 

<H5>    PARTY OFFICIAL ATTACKS REGIME, NOTES `ISLAMIC SOLUTION' </H5>
  Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn writes an 
approximately 3,000-word article on page five strongly 
criticizing the prime minister and other government officials 
for "corruption and mismanagement." 
  In his article, Husayn cites the government's "failed" 
policies in various economic, industrial, agricultural, and 
other spheres and accuses the prime minister of covering up 
fraud and corruption. He claims that the government acts on 
orders from world financial institutions and disregards people's 
interests. He says: "We" reject the U.S. "instructions" on 
Egypt's economy and adds that the IMF and World Bank promote 
their instructions on the grounds that these instructions 
represent the "Anglo-American school's" successful experiment in 
market economy. He remarks that what is good for the United 
States is not necessarily good for other countries. He says 
that the "Anglo-American school's principles of materialism and 
consumer inclination," which do not strike a balance between 
capital owners and the nation's interests, are not compatible 
with the "Islamic solution" in economics. 
  From the mere economic point of view, he says, a worker 
offers more effort as his loyalty to his establishment increases 
and as his sense of security and stability strengthens. He then 
claims that the "Anglo-American School" says the opposite and 
that "Asian experiments" led by Japan have proved that what "we" 
advocate on the basis of "Islam and tradition" is right. 
  Toward the end of his article, the author suggests: 
"Prolonging this situation is impossible. If national dialogue 
will not serve as a means to change this situation then it will 
be no more than a waste of time. At the very least the nation 
requires a guarantee for its humanity, demands rulers with 
resolve and a clean hand, and demands safety for its physical 
wellbeing, honor, and property." He adds: "At most, we should 
move toward a comprehensive change that will restore Islam to 
its dominant standing while all the religious Egyptians turn 
toward building a new civilization and a strong state that 
integrates and unites with its Arab brothers." 
  He claims: "We" do not agree with the advocates of violence, 
their methods or their vision of an Islamic solution, and asks: 
What is the use of rejection if there is no better alternative 
way? 
  The author concludes by contending: "The nation wants 
change; it wants it peacefully. But if you do not meet its 
wish, an explosion is inevitable." 
<H5>  DOCTORS' UNION HOLDS CONFERENCE IN SUPPORT OF BOSNIAN MUSLIMS </H5>
  In an approximately 420-word report on page 7, AL-SHA'B's 
Khalid Yunus says various men addressed a "mass popular 
conference" organized by the Doctors' Association in support of 
Bosnian Muslims. 
  In his address, Dr. 'Abd-al-Hayy al-Faramawi, professor of 
Koranic interpretation at al-Azhar University, attributed the 
"tragedy" of the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Muslim 
rulers' weakness and languor, which have led to the loss of 
Palestine, Eritrea, Somalia, Burma, Kashmir, and finally 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Al-Faramawi is quoted as saying that 
resolving the Islamic nations' causes can be achieved by rulers 
who are conscious of such causes and want to see the 
"inviolability of Islamic blood" and respect for the ulema and 
the nation's belief in the "sanctity of all forms of jihad." 
  Addressing the conferees, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali said: 
"History repeats itself. As Jerusalem fell amid the silence of 
the Islamic world, Bosnia falls today while no member country of 
the Islamic Conference Organization moves." He is cited as 
adding that the European countries and the United States do not 
know the "language of conscience" but know only their interests. 
He is also quoted calling for applying the Koran so that the 
nation can emerge from its predicament. 
  Dr. Ahmad al-Malat, deputy general guide of the Muslim 
Brotherhood, also addressed the conference, stressing the 
importance of every Muslim performing his duty toward "his 
brothers" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said: "The Islamic 
nation--both the rulers and the governed--has not played its 
role toward this unarmed people, although they belong to Islam, 
with which they conquered various parts of the world."

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at the signing </F>
ceremony of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement at the 
International Convention Center in Cairo -- live, in English] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: Nowadays you can watch how 
birth is being given on the television. Now you have had the 
occasion to watch it. What really happened is that we finished 
our negotiations by 0230 in the morning, and apparently we were 
short of five minutes. We apologize for taking these five 
minutes from you. [applause] 
  We had a dream before we had a map. Now we have a map and a 
dream together. Thank you. [applause] 
  Your Excellency, the President of Egypt Husni Mubarak 
[applause]: Happy birthday! Blessed may be your way from being 
a pilot in the defense of your country and becoming a captain in 
the peace of the region; [applause] 
  Prime Minister Rabin, that his people appreciate a decision 
and a leadership in a very difficult time; 
  Foreign Secretary of State Warren Christopher, thank you for 
your tireless support; [applause] 
  Foreign Minister Kozyrev, thank you for the positive 
assistance; [applause] 
  Foreign Minister Godal of Norway, thank you for being a 
Norwegian; [applause] 
  My dear friend, 'Amr Musa [applause], whose smiles and 
wisdom helped so much to overcome the hurdles of the 
negotiations, thank you very much; [applause] 
  Chairman 'Arafat, our partner in a very difficult journey: 
We did it! [applause] 
  Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and 
gentlemen, the reason for the conflict in the Middle East was 
the unhappy encounter between the Jewish and the Arab 
renaissance at the same time, at the same place. Thus, for 
almost half a century, we experienced blood and hatred, terror 
and war. Today we declare that the conflict is over. [applause] 
  Today we have agreed to promise mothers and children, Arabs 
and Jewish, that no finger will pull a trigger or endanger the 
lives or to affect the dignity or happiness of their children. 
  Less than a year has passed since the night in Oslo where 
Israelis and Palestinians gathered secretly to initial a 
dramatic turning point in the history of their peoples. What 
seems in the eyes of many to be utopian becomes today a reality. 
I recall the strenuous days and endless nights needed to cross 
the valleys of mistrust and suspicion. And, again, we did it! 
  We refer to a dual commitment: the moral history of our 
nation and the need of the people in the region. Our position 
stems from a moral code: Govern yourself; don't rule others. 
  So, the agreement today is not a submission to the threats 
of 
weapons; it is in reality a return to the values of our heritage. 
  We do not want to be the governors, the judges, or the 
police 
of the Palestinian people. It is for the Palestinians to elect 
their leaders, nominate their judges, appoint their policemen. 
All we wish is to become their friendly neighbors. [applause] 
All we hope is to see them as our good neighbors. Today we 
welcome you, the Palestinian people, as neighbors. [applause] 
  We must look ahead. We state earnestly to the Arab people, 
that you and us, we need a Middle East, a geography of peace, a 
territory of prosperity, a community based on market economy, 
responsible diplomacy, and a land that will regain its 
fertility. We assure that we shall not stop here; that we shall 
reach peace with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and make it 
comprehensive and durable. [applause] 
  We shall continue to negotiate with the Palestinians for a 
permanent solution. Relations are more telling than borders. We 
are mapping today our relations, so that we shall be able to map 
borders in the future. With the exception of war, the greatest 
menace is the poverty. Nobody should pay for follies and 
belligerencies. We can put to the right use our available 
resources, the water we possess, the land we own, the knowledge 
we acquire for the benefit of our people -- a Middle East for 
the people and by the people. 
  The story of modern society is not a national separation but 
an economic cooperation. No nation can dominate, and yet every 
nation must compete and ably so. We know already that computers 
are mightier than guns. We know that the new opportunities 
reside in the campuses of the scientists rather than in the 
camps of the armies. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the future is inevitable, just as 
peace 
is inevitable, and for all of us. A year ago, a meeting like 
that of today would have been perceived as unreal. Yet today it 
is a reality. Alongside the magic river that held the cradle of 
Moses, at the foot of the pyramids that withstood the test of 
time, to see such a distinguished and unique gathering like you 
and us here today carries a new promise. 
  The president of Egypt; the foreign ministers of the 
cosponsors, the United States and the Russian Republic; as well 
as the foreign minister of Norway; respected delegates of Arab 
countries and Europe; sponsors and donors from all continents: 
We thank you for the sense of a fresh beginning, for a new 
image and a new era for the people of our region. 
  Much work still lies before us. Many are the enemies and 
many are the obstacles on the road of peace. Yet, if we do all 
we must, we can make this concrete beginning into a brilliant 
future. And then, when looking upon the horizon, we shall know 
that the reddish lining is not of blood but of a rising dawn. 
  In the words of prophet Isaiah: In place of brass I will 
bring gold, in place of iron I will bring silver. Violence 
shall no more be heard in your land, nor war, nor destruction 
within your borders. [applause] 
  Long live peace to all of us! Thank you. [applause]

  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful the compassionate. 
And we wished to be gracious to those who were being depressed 
in the land, to make them leaders in faith, and make them heirs 
[Koranic verse followed by applause] 
  President Muhammad Husni Mubarak of the fraternal Arab 
Republic of Egypt, Mr. Christopher, Mr. Kozyrev, Israeli Prime 
Minister Rabin, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, and my 
brother His Excellency Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa: 
  In the historic moments that we are witnessing today on the 
land of fraternal Egypt, I extend to you, Mr. President, and to 
the government and great people of Egypt, greetings and 
appreciation of your constant concern and continuing efforts to 
achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the entire region. 
This is Egypt's fate and real role as determined by its 
position in the heart of the Arab world and the Middle East and 
between the three continents, Asia, Africa, and Europe 
[applause]. Many happy returns on your birthday today. 
[applause] 
  You are now carrying the banner that is building the 
structure of peace. Without your constant contribution and 
role, it would be difficult for us to see such an achievement. 
To you, Your Excellency the President, and through you to every 
Egyptian on this good and towering land, I extend the greetings 
of every Palestinian in our land and abroad, those who look with 
hope toward a new era of genuine, lasting, and comprehensive 
peace. I also thank Foreign Minister brother 'Amr Musa. 
[applause] 
  I also extend greetings and deep thanks to the sponsors of 
the peace process, the United States and the Russian Federation, 
and to President Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin, who 
are represented here today by His Excellency Secretary Warren 
Christopher and His Excellency Minister Andrey Kozyrev. I also 
thank the states of the European Union, the nonaligned states, 
the Islamic states, and the African countries. 
  Their persistent efforts had a great effect on overcoming 
the obstacles and on bringing views closer so as to complete 
this first step in the Palestinian-Israeli peace course and from 
it, God willing, move to the Arab-Israeli peace. 
  I also remember with reverence and respect our friend and 
minister, Norway's Johan Holst, who died with great hopes of 
sharing in these moments of implementing the first step of the 
agreement. He participated quietly and effectively to achieve 
it. I welcome here His Excellency Minister Tore Godal, 
appreciating his important endeavors and the Norwegian 
Government's constant efforts and good moves to serve the peace 
process in every sphere. 
  In the name of every Palestinian man and woman, I look with 
great confidence and hope at our brothers and our people's 
friends who are participating in this historic occasion and I 
think of those who could not come. I thank them all and stress 
to them that our people today in the West Bank, Gaza, holy 
Jerusalem, and in all the diaspora are looking more than ever 
toward your role so that this first step in Gaza and Jericho 
will become the real start for completing the peace process, 
guaranteeing our Palestinian people's legitimate rights, 
achieving justice and equality by ending the occupation of our 
Palestinian territories, and building the Palestinian future 
based on democracy, development, and progress, a future linked 
with the tradition of its glorious Arab nation. 
  Today, brothers, belongs to all our brothers who have helped 
to make it. It belongs to our brother President Zine el Abidine 
Ben Ali, the president of green Tunisia, who provided the 
Palestinian people's leadership with all the facilities for 
achieving their rights. The day belongs to our brothers in the 
great Arab Maghreb, especially His Majesty King Hassan II and 
his good efforts, President Lamine Zeroual, chairman of the Arab 
Maghreb Union, and the other brother members of the Union. It 
also belongs to our brothers in the Arab Gulf. I particularly 
mention the role of His Majesty King Fahd, custodian of the two 
holy mosques, [applause] and all his brother leaders of the Gulf 
countries. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's planes are today 
carrying the Palestinian security forces who are returning to 
the homeland. This highlights the constant support and 
brotherhood, the ties of which will never be broken, God willing. 
  On this day, too, I salute fraternal Jordan, His Majesty 
King Husayn, and Jordan's Government and people, who share with 
us a common date and a promising future, God willing. 
  I also express to our brothers in Syria and Lebanon and to 
President Hafiz al-Asad and President Ilyas al-Hirawi the 
confidence that the ties of fate binding us will be strengthened 
because we are acting on the firm basis that peace will not be 
just if it is not comprehensive. Peace will prevail over our 
region when the resolutions of international legitimacy are 
applied to all the Arab fronts and when the eras of occupation, 
the eras of wars, and the cycles of violence end. 
  I also salute the brothers in Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, and Libya 
for embracing their Palestinian brothers since the departure 
from Beirut. 
  Allow me to congratulate the people of South Africa and 
struggling President Nelson Mandela and [former] President de 
Klerk [applause] for the victory achieved by the South African 
people in the democratic experience, when it vanquished 
injustice and racial discrimination to build a future based on 
tolerance, equality, justice, and respect for human rights. 
  Respected ladies and gentlemen, we are signing the step to 
mark the start. It is a step linked with other steps in the 
West Bank during the coming few months so that our people can, 
for the first time, see the real horizon for establishing the 
just peace. 
  The withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho is the prelude; it 
opens 
the door to removing the entire occupation and to establishing 
new relations between our peoples, Prime Minister Rabin, between 
our Israeli and Palestinian peoples, for the sake of our 
children and yours. [applause] 
  Completing this step required Herculean courage after long 
periods of war and violence. The coming stage will require 
still greater courage, a thorough insight, real farsightedness, 
and firm patience so that we can establish a firm and 
unshakeable peace, the peace of the bold. 
  The Palestinian people have lived on their land throughout 
history. They helped to create civilization and raise the voice 
of peace, the voice of the only all-powerful God, the creator, 
the lord of the universe and of the three heavenly religions, 
calling for praising God's blessings, giving, and his name on 
this sacred land. 
  The people of Palestine, based on their deep historical 
heritage, today express their loyalty to the just and 
comprehensive peace. Thus our people demonstrated faithfulness 
to the heritage of their successive generations; to the sweat of 
the Palestinian people, mixed as it is with the soil of the 
earth; to the Palestinian maker's determination to build life 
and let it flourish; and to the creativity of the Palestinian 
intellectual, who always believes that history will never go off 
its track no matter how much time passes. [applause] 
  Our people, gentlemen, have struggled long to see the 
beginning of the peace era. For peace to be achieved, our 
people offered dear sacrifices. To achieve this recognition of 
our national rights, the eyes of bereaved mothers and of 
children who were raised to know that love and loyalty to the 
homeland are the highest values of life looked forward. Also 
looking forward to this were the prisoners, whose hope of 
freedom, for themselves and for their people, is renewed every 
day, and the refugee camp residents, who never lost confidence 
that a new era of freedom would come. 
  Nothing has gone in vain. Alive and great nations make their 
wounds, the sacrifice of their martyrs, and their long suffering 
the motives for the future and the banners for building a new 
era based on justice under the shadow of tolerance and 
coexistence among the three religions of Judaism, Christianity, 
and Islam over centuries. 
  We have offered a great deal to reach this day. We 
confronted patiently and persistently every hindrance and doubt 
and we always thought that every step in the peace negotiations, 
despite all the pain, was a move away from the era of war and 
violence nearer to the era of equal rights and the 
implementation of international legitimacy. While today we 
celebrate the signing of the first step, we must all realize 
that all those concerned about peace, including our people at 
home and in the diaspora, measure the seriousness of this step 
by one criterion: honest and precise implementation and the 
change it will make to the reality on the ground. It is the 
right of our people and of everybody concerned with genuine 
peace to point to the measures isolating holy Jerusalem from its 
surroundings and preventing the Palestinians from entering it 
and the other sacred Islamic and Christian places. These 
measures obstruct life in the city, paralyze its economy, and 
separate the sons of the same family. 
  All this is incompatible with the spirit of the just and 
real peace, with the course of equality, justice, and human 
rights that we are aspiring to adopt as the basis for free and 
positive relations between the two neighboring peoples, as Mr. 
Peres said, between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. The 
suffering of the city of Hebron following the bloody massacre 
cannot continue. It is still suffering encirclement and siege 
both inside and outside it. 
  The continuation of the settlement and the attempt to impose 
the fait accompli in Jerusalem and in other areas conflict with 
the essence, clauses, and the short and long-term objectives of 
the peace process. 
  The boldness of peace prompts me today to adopt the policy 
of 
frankness on peace without which we cannot end the age of 
confrontation and start the age of constructive and real 
cooperation. The Arab peoples and millions of Muslims and 
Christians will observe our practical steps tomorrow to pass 
judgment on the possibility of coexistence and of opening a new 
chapter in normal relations. All those who want the success of 
the Palestinian-Israeli peace experiment realize the importance 
of the great steps facing this peace, including the settlements, 
the refugee problem, holy Jerusalem, and the need to solve it 
later, as we agreed, so as to help create a new era of 
protecting the future of the entire region and ensuring openness 
between their peoples and countries on the basis of respect for 
the rules and resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident today that the 
Palestinian people will receive this new stage with a desire to 
provide a real opportunity for building real peace with the same 
desire it has for its national identity and its independent 
national being. Our people extends its hand to the Israeli 
people to start this era and end the whirlpool of violence for 
the sake of our real interests today and the interests of our 
coming generations. 
  Coexistence is possible. It is inevitable. It is our common 
fate to live together as neighbors governed by the rules of 
justice, democracy, and national and human dignity. 
  Hatred, bigotry, and extremism will only lead to more 
squandering of our creative and brilliant resources. We are 
proposing the alternative today, namely equality, joint 
building, and respect for every people's right and independent 
choice and security. 
  Today again I also address our great Arab nation, leaders 
and 
peoples, on the threshold of the first step of the return to the 
homeland and stress to them that their pain, sacrifice, and 
determination to uphold our Palestinian people's national 
legitimate rights prompt us today to strengthen our fraternal 
ties in every field so that peace for Palestine will, as always, 
be a peace for all the Arabs. 
  Yes, gentlemen, our peace is a peace for our Arab nation. It 
is a peace for Israel, for the Middle East region, for the whole 
world. Yes, it is a peace for the whole world. 
  O God, you are peace, peace comes from you, and peace is for 
you. Blessed are you God, full of majesty, bounty, and honor. 
Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, and goodwill 
toward men. Peace be with you.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the signing </F>
ceremony of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement at the 
International Convention Center in Cairo -- live; passages 
within slantlines in English] 
  [Text] /The president of Egypt, President Mubarak; the 
cosponsors: the secretary of state of the United States, the 
Foreign Minister Kozyrev of Russia; Chairman 'Arafat, the 
chairman of the PLO; foreign ministers; distinguished guests; 
members of the committees that worked so hard to produce what 
has been done and signed at this stage; the citizens of Israel; 
the Palestinian people: First, I would like to join in the many 
happy returns for your birthday; it will take you addition many 
years to reach my age. 
  /I am not.... [pauses] How to put it? We witnessed, you 
witnessed, the world witnessed the tip of the iceberg of 
problems that we shall have to overcome in the implementation of 
even the first phase of the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. To 
overcome 100 years of animosity, suspicion, bloodshed, it's not 
so simple. There is an opposition on both sides to what we are 
doing today, and it will require a lot, a lot on both sides to 
make sure that we will succeed and achieve peaceful coexistence 
and, in addition to the coexistence, to bring a permanent 
solution. 
  /Today we signed the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, which is 
the first phase of implementation. It's a very daring project, 
and we are committed by signature today to make sure that it 
will work. We will achieve our goals; we will be able to 
overcome all these problems. You have heard many different 
speeches. Allow me, after saying what I have said by now, to 
turn in Hebrew to the people of Israel./ 
  In 1889, 105 years ago, Avraham Jablonsky, a blacksmith, was 
murdered in his clay hut in Wadi Khalil. Avraham Jablonsky was 
the first victim in the history of the Jewish settlement in 
Eretz Yisra'el in modern times. He was the first victim of the 
bloody conflict between us and the Palestinian people since our 
return to the land of our forefathers after 2,000 years of 
exile. Since Avraham Jablonsky's death, the experience of our 
grandparents, parents, ourselves, and even our children and 
grandchildren has been almost solely one of blood and 
bereavement. For 100 years, this blood gave us no rest. What 
did we want? We wanted to return to the land of our 
forefathers, to the land of the Bible. We wanted a homeland; we 
wanted a home; we wanted a safe haven; we wanted a place to call 
our own; we wanted to live as all men live, to be like other 
nations. We wanted to live. 
  The war for the land of our forefathers took our best sons 
and daughters. It drained us of spiritual and physical energies 
and channeled our entire spiritual and physical existence to 
paths we did not want, to paths of pain. We deplore that. Even 
in our most difficult times, our hearts ached at the sights of 
devastation, hatred, and death. Even in our most bitter 
moments, we knew that the tears of a bereaved mother from within 
our midst are no different from the tears of another bereaved 
mother; that they are equally piercing and painful in any 
family; that the cries of despair are the same even when uttered 
in other languages. 
  We decided to try to put an end to this terrible circle of 
pain. We decided to look ahead at a different future. On 13 
September 1993, on the White House lawn in Washington, we 
decided to embark on a new road. Tomorrow we will begin 
implementing the DOP. The DOP and its implementation -- in Gaza 
and Jericho, at this point -- is designed to attain a dual 
purpose: to enable the Palestinian authority to administer the 
lives of the Palestinians and to uphold public law and order in 
their places of residence. Our goal is to uphold security for 
Israelis wherever they may be, particularly in the wake of the 
change that is scheduled to take place in Gaza and Jericho. If 
the security of the Israelis is not ensured and if the 
Palestinians are not given new hope, the goal of the agreement 
will not be attained. 
  A great deal depends on the Palestinians. We are embarking 
on this new road with a lot of hope and with strong will, and we 
know that it entails wonderful chances as well as serious risks. 
We are convinced that both peoples can live on the same strip 
of land, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, as the 
Biblical prophets envisioned; to give this land, the land of 
stones and graves, the taste of milk and honey it deserves. 
  At this hour, I appeal to the Palestinian people and say to 
them: Palestinian neighbors, 100 bloody years have instilled in 
us hatred for each other. For 100 years, we wanted to see you 
dead and you wanted to see us dead. We killed you and you 
killed us. Thousands of our graves and yours dot the mountains 
and the valleys, and they are painful landmarks in your history 
and ours. Today, you and we are extending our hands in peace. 
Today we are opening a new account. The Israeli people expect 
you not to let them down. Let the new hope flourish. It is not 
easy to forget the past, but let us try to overcome the rancors 
and obstacles in order to open a new, unique, and historic 
horizon; an opportunity which may never recur for a different 
life, a life that is not fraught with fear, a life that is not 
fraught with hatred, a life that does not involve the frightened 
eyes of children, a life that does not entail pain, a life in 
which we will build a home, plant a vineyard, and live to a ripe 
old age alongside our fellow men. 
  Tomorrow morning, we all hope to awaken to a new day, to 
awaken to a new future and a new chance for our children. For 
their sake, it was necessary to fight; for their sake, it is 
vital to reach peace. 
  I thank all those who lent us a hand and helped us get to 
this day: the heads of state and statesmen; the soldiers who 
fought and the soldiers we hope will not have to fight. 
  /A special thanks to our host, to the president of Egypt, 
President Mubarak, the leader of the great Arab country that set 
the precedent that peace can be achieved, peace can be 
maintained, peace can bring peoples together. [applause] 
  /Allow me to thank to the secretary of state of the United 
States, a true friend of Israel; and the foreign minister of 
Russia; to the representatives of Norway; and to others that 
assisted so much./ 
  On a spring day of 1994, two weeks ago, the late Second 
Lieutenant Shahar Simani was murdered. He was 21 years old and 
a resident of Ashqelon. His bullet-riddled body was found by 
the roadside on the way to Jerusalem. A thread of blood links 
the Israeli people from the murder of Avraham Jablonsky, the 
blacksmith, 105 years ago to the murder of 2d. Lt. Shahar Simani 
two weeks ago. I pray: May Shahar Simani be the last fatality 
among all of us, Israelis and Palestinians. 
  The new hope we are taking with us as we leave this place is 
immeasurable. There is no limit to our goodwill, to the will to 
see a historic reconciliation between two peoples that have 
lived so far by their swords. In the alleyways of Khan Yunus 
and on the outskirts of Ramat Gan, in the houses of Gaza, in the 
squares of Hadera, Rafah, and 'Afula, a new reality is being 
born today. One hundred years of the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict and millions of people who want to live are watching 
us. May God be with us. [applause]

<F P=106> [Concluding remarks by President Husni Mubarak at the </F>
signing ceremony of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement 
at the International Convention Center in Cairo -- live; Mubarak 
speaks in English with simultaneous translation into Arabic] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, today we are witnessing a 
historic event that is likely to influence the fate of our 
region for decades and centuries to come. It marks the 
realization of a great dream and a unique vision by the 
peacemakers, who kept their faith, under difficult 
circumstances, in the noble goal of peace. 
  Their participation in this occasion is living testimony 
that 
the world is fully committed to this great issue. It is also a 
recognition of the wisdom of those who made this achievement 
possible. 
  We are looking forward to further support. Let us extend to 
them all material and moral support so that the agreement the 
Palestinians and Israelis have signed can be implemented. They 
took no chances or risks when they opted for peace. Let us 
prove to the critics of both sides that none of their fears were 
founded. Let us continue our efforts with the same will and 
determination to achieve the same success on the other peace 
tracks. This is the essence of the comprehensive settlement to 
which we are committed. 
  Finally, we must waste no effort to achieve a global peace. 
We must also turn our attention to the tragedies taking place 
in many regions. It is our common commitment to unite against 
any violation of the dignity of man. God bless us and may peace 
prevail on earth. Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 May (MENA)--MENA has learned that 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat refused to sign the maps 
contained in the annexes of the agreement because they did not 
match an agreement reached with the Israeli side in a meeting 
that lasted until 0230 this morning. No new maps were prepared 
because there was no time to prepare prints of the maps agreed 
on. 
  A dispute emerged over the size of Jericho and whether it is 
a city or an area. An agreement was reached that the size of 
Jericho is 61.5 square km and that the 20 additional square km 
can be added to the Jericho area when the matter is discussed 
again in three months. President 'Arafat rejected this idea. 
He wants Jericho's size to be discussed in three months without 
prior specification of the area that can be added. 
  Another dispute emerged concerning a 13-km stretch of land 
on 
Gaza's coast that has an Israeli settlement. An agreement was 
reached that the matter will be discussed again in three months 
and that the Palestinians have the right to engage in any 
activity in that area in the meantime. Responsible Palestinian 
sources say that future talks on this matter may lead to the 
removal of the entire settlement.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, May 3 (AFP) -- Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin arrived here Tuesday [3 May] to finalise the 
Palestinian self-rule accord with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat as 
officials said a last-minute crisis threatening Wednesday's 
signing had been resolved. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said as he arrived 
with Rabin: "We are going to sign tomorrow, I feel great." 
  They still had to solve outstanding problems and "time has 
its limits," but he dismissed talk of any postponement, saying 
"we need a crisis before the signature." 
  The PLO had warned Wednesday's ceremony was under threat 
after Israel backtracked on several points of the historic deal 
for self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. 
  But Ahmad al-Tibi, an Israeli Arab and 'Arafat adviser, said 
that the "crisis" was over and the final points would be dealt 
with by the two leaders on Tuesday night. 
  'Arafat and Rabin have still to agree on the size of the 
autonomous Jericho area and on Palestinian demands for the 
presence of a symbolic policeman on the Allenby bridge from 
Jordan to the West Bank. 
  A PLO official said they would also have to resolve two 
other 
undisclosed issues as Israel prepared to hand over control of 
part of the territories it seized in its 1967 war with the 
Arabs. [passage omitted 
  Meanwhile on the ground, Israeli soldiers were given new 
orders not to shoot at Palestinians unless they were in "real 
danger" and to let them celebrate freely after Wednesday's 
signing, an army spokesman said. 
  And the redeployment of Israeli forces moved up a gear as 
equipment was pulled out from bases across Gaza. 
  The Israelis are to redeploy to protect the Jewish 
settlements in Gaza, according to the September 13 Declaration 
of Principles on autonomy, and pull out from Jericho altogether. 
  A first contingent of 1,000 Palestinian policemen were set 
to 
cross into Gaza on Thursday from the 9,000-strong force which 
will be deployed in Gaza and Jericho, a spokesman for the new 
force said. 
  The army declared Jericho out of bounds to avoid trouble 
after settlers called a demonstration Tuesday evening at the 
ancient Jewish synagogue in Jericho. A large number of rabbis 
intended to camp in the building. 
  The army also planned to cut off the main roads into the 
West 
Bank and Gaza to prevent Jewish settlers from protesting. 
  In the Gulf, a session of multilateral peace talks in Qatar 
began with the country's Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jabbur Al 
Thani warning that Israel's nuclear potential was a threat to 
stability in the Middle East.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 May (MENA)--Hasan 'Usfur, member of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli Security 
Affairs Committee, has disclosed that the new obstacles that 
Israel suddenly raised to the agreement on self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho result from its putting forth 25 new points on all 
issues--security, civilian, and legal. 
  He told a MENA correspondent today that these points had 
been 
agreed upon earlier. 
  He said: This is a known Israeli tactic aimed at preventing 
us from making any new proposals.

  [Text] Here are some of the major points in the agreement 
between the PLO and Israel which appear in the document received 
by our Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari: 
  Both parties stress their determination to live in peaceful 
coexistence. Israel will withdraw from the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho within three weeks. 
  Both parties will take all the steps necessary to prevent 
terrorism, crime, and any acts of violence. Israel will be able 
to take interdictory measures in the areas where it is 
responsible for security with the intention of bringing any 
incidents to a rapid conclusion and turning them over to the 
Palestinian police to handle. The use of firearms will be 
prohibited, except in the case of immediate danger. Shots will 
be fired solely for the purpose of deterrence. 
  Israelis, including IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers, 
will be permitted to use the roads in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho. Palestinians will be able to travel on the roads 
crossing through the Israeli settlements. 
  The Palestinian authority will be composed of 24 members and 
will be responsible for all legislative, executive, and judicial 
powers. The judicial powers of the Palestinian authority will 
not apply to Israelis. Israel retains judicial authority over 
the Israeli settlements. 
  The Palestinian authority will have no powers in the field 
of 
foreign relations, and it will be unable to establish embassies 
and consulates.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 3 May (MENA)-- Engineer Fayiz Zaydan, 
director general of the Palestinian civil aviation and the 
Palestinian airlines, has stated that the Palestinian and 
Israeli sides have agreed to build airports in Gaza and Jericho. 
He said that regular domestic flights will operate between Gaza 
and Jericho. International flights will begin operation between 
these two cities and various parts of the world as soon as the 
runways are built and the airports equipped with the necessary 
air navigation equipment needed for take offs and landing of 
jets and propeller aircraft early next year. 
  Zaydan added that the Palestinian civil aviation authority 
will build temporary landing strips as soon as the Israeli 
troops withdraw from and the Palestinian police deploy in Gaza 
and Jericho. These strips will be first used for flights between 
Gaza and Jericho, and between those cities and Cairo. He added 
that flights to other capitals in the region will be negotiated 
in due time. Engineer Zaydan said that these temporary landing 
strips will be used by two 50-passenger Palestinian planes, the 
standard capacity according to the rules of air safety. He 
expects these flights to begin operation in August. 
  The Palestinian official pointed out that four 20-passenger 
planes will be set aside for the Palestinian authority officials 
to use in their travels between Gaza and Jericho. Four 
helicopters will be used by the Palestinian civil defense for 
air and sea rescue operations and for transportation. Two 
helicopters will be used by the Palestinian president and his 
guests in their trips between Gaza and Jericho. [passage

  [Text] An understanding was reached in Cairo overnight 
whereby the Gaza-Jericho agreement would be signed even if the 
last outstanding issue -- positioning a Palestinian policeman on 
the Allenby Bridge -- is not settled. 
  Our correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Israel agreed last 
night to expand Jericho's autonomous area and include an area 
west of al-'Awja' in it. Both delegations are pursuing their 
contacts in a bid to solve the question of the Palestinian 
policeman by the time of the signing ceremony.

  [Text] President Husni Mubarak has met for the second time 
with members of the Palestinian and Israeli delegations to 
continue his extensive consultations and discussions with them. 
The Palestinian side was lead by Yasir 'Arafat while the 
Israeli side was lead by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  President Mubarak has been following up on the talks between 
the two sides, which lasted for approximately six hours, ending 
at 0130 this morning. President Mubarak met with the 
delegations immediately afterwards. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat, has stated that the Palestinian-Israeli agreement 
will be signed today, adding that everything has been resolved. 
Dr. Sha'th made these remarks following the Palestinian-Israeli 
talks that ended at 0205 this morning. 
  Regarding the differences that existed between the two 
sides, 
Sha'th said that solutions were found for all these points, with 
the support of President Husni Mubarak, Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. He added: 
Negotiations always involve give and take and we have reached 
an agreement that we are satisfied with. 
  Concluding his remarks, Sha'th said he was pleased with what 
has been achieved. He added that the beginning is always 
important because this is the first time in the history of the 
Palestinian people that they have had a chance to rule 
themselves by themselves on their own territory. He added: 
This is not all we want, it is just a start. 
  Foreign Minister Musa said following the Palestinian-Israeli 
talks that the agreement for the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles will be signed at 1100 [0800 GMT] this 
morning. He added that all the outstanding issues had been 
settled and that the details will be made public today. He 
added: I will not announce anything on behalf of the 
Palestinians or the Israelis. Everything has been discussed in 
detail on the maps related to the agreement. 
  Asked if an agreement has been reached on the size of 
Jericho, Musa said that the area of Jericho has been increased 
by several kilometers, provided this is taken into consideration 
[as heard]. Regarding the guards at the crossing points, Musa 
said a certain agreement has been reached over this point. 
  Musa expressed his happiness at reaching an agreement, 
noting 
that some insignificant points have been left for a later stage. 
  Regarding the release of the Palestinian prisoners, Musa 
said 
this matter was discussed and many of them will be released. 
The foreign minister added that the question of territorial 
water was also discussed. 
  On U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's role in the 
talks, Musa noted that Christopher played a very important role. 
Asked if President Mubarak played a role in persuading 'Arafat, 
Musa said: President Mubarak has persuaded all parties, not 
just 'Arafat, to be flexible. 
  Asked why President Mubarak spent so many hours in the 
negotiations for the first time, Musa said that it is natural 
for President Mubarak to be present throughout the duration of 
the talks, since Egypt is the country that has been devoting its 
efforts to solve the Palestinian issue for more than 40 years. 
He added that Egypt is also the host country for the signing 
ceremony of this historic agreement between the Palestinians and 
Israelis.

<F P=106> [Report by Arye Gus and Shlomo Raz in Cairo -- live] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Gus] Prime Minister Rabin, 'Arafat, President 
Mubarak, Foreign Minister Musa, Secretary of State Christopher, 
and the heads of the delegations to the autonomy talks sat for 
eight hours last night until they settled all the disputed 
issues and announced that the agreement would be signed today at 
1100. 
  Last night's session was very contentious. It was fraught 
with mutual accusations about reneging on decisions and earlier 
positions, and with demands to reopen issues which had already 
been finalized. At times, the atmosphere was one of 
near-crisis. Occasionally, there were loud verbal exchanges, and 
U.S. Secretary of State Christopher had to intervene to calm 
'Arafat down. 
  At 0215 [2315 GMT], Nabil Sha'th and 'Amr Musa came out of 
the room to face the press, and Musa announced: There is an 
agreement. The sides held discussions and finalized all the 
details of the agreement. 
  Following are the outstanding issues the draft committees 
left to Rabin and 'Arafat to finalize: 
  Jericho's autonomous area: The area from which Israel will 
withdraw has been expanded to 62 km, far less than what the 
Palestinians demanded. However, the size and fate of this area 
may be brought up for further discussion at a later stage. In 
other words, this issue remains open. 
  Positioning a Palestinian policeman on the Allenby Bridge: 
Israel refused to accept this demand, and a policeman will not 
be positioned on the bridge. This issue may also be brought up 
for further discussion at a later stage. 
  Releasing prisoners: This was one of the toughest problems. 
Israel refused to release more than the 5,000 prisoners that had 
been agreed earlier. As may be recalled, the Palestinians had 
demanded the release of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and 
Islamic Jihad members who would in exchange undertake a 
commitment to stop engaging in terror and to support the 
Declaration of Principles. These terrorists will not be 
released at this point, but their case may be brought up for 
further discussion by the security liaison committee to be 
established at a later stage. 
  Territorial waters: The area to be given to the Palestinians 
has been expanded from 3 to 6 miles. They will also be given 
fishing rights in another 6 miles further out to sea. 
  Security activities: This is a very important issue which 
could cause problems and disputes in the future. The area of 
activity has been increased to 75 meters on each side of the 
east-west roads. In any event, the Palestinians will not have 
the right to detain or imprison Israelis, and they will have to 
summon a joint patrol. The Palestinian police force will not be 
allowed to detain uniformed Israeli security troops and 
vehicles. Israel will have the right and prerogative to any 
immediate reaction -- or engagement [last word in English], as 
this is defined in the agreement -- to any operation or incident 
which might endanger lives or property. However, the aim will be 
to end the incident and to defer its handling to the Palestinian 
police force as soon as possible. [passage omitted] 
  [Raz] Another decision made last night was to append several 
letters to the agreement. One letter deals with an issue which 
had been finalized, but the Israeli delegation nevertheless 
pressed to put it in writing: Yasir 'Arafat will not be able to 
enter the area bearing the title of president, but that of 
chairman of the PLO. 
  Another issue spelled out in a letter has to do with the 
talks about the early transfer of power in other areas of the 
West Bank other than Jericho, which will begin at once. This 
issue had been in dispute for many months and was raised in 
Washington more than once. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 4 May (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the 
Palestinian negotiating team, said that the two sides were still 
discussing Jericho's map up until the signing of the agreement 
today. 
  Speaking to journalists following the signing ceremony, 
Sha'th said the two sides had no time to review the entire 
agreement because the negotiations continued until 1100 this 
morning. 
  Sha'th pointed out that during the signing ceremony 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat requested a pledge from the 
Israeli side that the Jericho map appended to the agreement not 
be the final map. He stated this in a document appended to the 
agreement. 
  Sha'th revealed that President Husni Mubarak and others at 
the ceremony promised that the document would be appended to the 
agreement. The document, which states: "Jericho's area is not 
final and is still the subject of negotiations between the two 
sides," was signed by president 'Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that 2,000 detainees will be released 
tomorrow, Thursday, and that more will be freed over the next 
three weeks. He added that one of the important aspects of the 
agreement is the understanding reached concerning the return of 
Palestinians from abroad.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The next central issue, if I 
may call it that, is the fact that last night -- and so far I 
have not heard that this has changed -- 'Arafat told the 
Americans, Rabin, and Mubarak that he is not ready to 
immediately send in a large police force into the Gaza Strip. 
Therefore, the implementation of the agreement in practice, the 
practical handing over of the keys, may last more than the seven 
days which were initially scheduled for the initial assumption 
of power by 'Arafat's forces in Rafah and Jericho.

  [Text] Doha -- Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabr Al Thani opened the fifth multilateral 
meeting of the Middle East Arms Control and Regional Security 
working group at the Doha Sheraton Hotel this morning. 
  The four-day meeting is attended by 220 representatives from 
43 countries. His Excellency Muhammad al-Za'abi, United Arab 
Emirates [UAE] ambassador to Qatar, heads the UAE delegation to 
the meetings. 
  In a speech opening the meeting, the Qatari foreign minister 
said that he hopes that the meeting will succeed, and that this 
meeting confirms the desire to effectively participate in the 
Middle East peace process. He said this meeting falls within 
the framework of Qatar's eagerness to render this peaceful 
process a success and of its continued participation in the 
multilateral talks, which basically deal with the post-peace 
stage. He explained that the aspired peace is one that 
restores all the occupied Arab territories to their owners, 
foremost holy Jerusalem, as well as restoring the Palestinians' 
legitimate national rights, including the right to 
self-determination.

  [Text] The Israeli delegation to the Qatar arms control 
talks has invited the neighboring countries participating in the 
multilateral talks to send delegations to visit IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] bases and installations. Sources in the Israeli 
delegation said that even if the invitation is declined, this 
will not mean failure because the very fact that it was issued 
constitutes a small step forward that is indicative of a change 
in atmosphere. 
  Our correspondent in Qatar Karmela Menashe reports that the 
Israeli delegation is meeting with delegations from Arab states 
concurrently with the plenum sessions. Sources in the Israeli 
delegation said that progress has been made in the discussions 
of the committee on arms control. 
  The atmosphere in the meetings outside the plenum hall is 
relaxed. In all the sessions, all the participants are 
addressing the issue of Israel's nonconventional weapons arsenal. 
  The Qatari foreign minister will leave for Cairo tomorrow to 
attend the signing ceremony of the agreement between the PLO and 
Israel.

  [Text] Kuwait City, 4 May, KUNA -- Nasir al-Rawdan, the 
second deputy prime minister and finance minister, announced 
today the government's intention to impose taxes "based on a 
studied method that will not hurt the citizen"; and an intention 
to reduce the level of tax exemptions enjoyed by some imported 
goods. 
  Al-Rawdan explained that the aim behind this decision was to 
increase the state's revenue and deal with the mounting budget 
deficit. He indicated, at the same time, that the relative 
reduction announced in the first chapter of next year's budget, 
which is being discussed by the appropriate committee of the 
National Assembly, will not affect the wages and salaries of 
staff of the state sector. 
  This announcement was made during a session of the National 
Assembly, which was chaired by Speaker Ahmad al-Sa'dun, during 
which a draft-reply to the Amir's speech was submitted to the 
Amir of Kuwait. The session also adopted three laws submitted 
by the government. 
  During the session, Information Minister Shaykh Sa'ud 
al-Nasir al-Sabah played down the importance of the statements 
regarding Kuwait, which were recently attributed to a member of 
the U.S. Congress. 
  Minister al-Sabah described these statements as "not 
representative in any way of the opinion of the friendly U.S. 
people, who support Kuwait's right in its legitimate demands 
vis-a- vis the Iraqi regime." 
  In this connection, the members of the National Assembly 
underlined the planned visit of a delegation from the National 
Assembly to the United States in the middle of this month. They 
are pinning great hopes on this visit to explain Kuwaiti 
positions regarding the situation in the Gulf region, and 
improve Kuwait's image abroad.

<F P=106> [Article by General (Retd) Mirza Azlam Beg: "Who Will Press </F>
the Button?"] 
  [Text] When I became the Vice Chief of the Army Staff, I 
was made privy to the nuclear programme and also responsible for 
the Pakistan Army. What I saw on the ground and based on it I 
gave the statement that Pakistan had acquired nuclear capability 
in 1987 and not in 1990. However, for three years, from 1987 to 
1989, the US President continued to certify that Pakistan had 
not acquired nuclear capability, which was contrary to what was 
stated in a report by Richard Barlow, an American responsible 
for monitoring our programme in Islamabad, even though, I am 
sure they must have read it. Pakistan in those days had 
importance due to the Afghan problem, the Russians were in 
Afghanistan, and the Americans needed Pakistan and thus a 
certification had to be given that Pakistan had not acquired the 
capability, whereas the fact was that we had. 
  In 1989 when Russia withdrew from Afghanistan, Pakistan 
ceased to be of importance to the US and thus Richard Barlow's 
Report became valid. Robert Oakley, the US Ambassador in 
Pakistan declared that Pakistan had crossed the red line, and 
consequently all the trouble started. It was also in early 1990 
that an uprising erupted in occupied Kashmir against India. 
This resulted in creating tension and the relations between the 
two countries became very strained. India was at a disadvantage 
as it had not expected an uprising in Kashmir. To divert 
attention, it tried to cash in on the tension between India and 
Pakistan and projected to the world that Pakistan, having 
acquired nuclear capability, was preparing to launch a nuclear 
attack against India. This created a commotion and the US took 
certain steps in a attempt to curb Pakistan. 
  The first step was to send Robert Gates to Pakistan. This 
was during the first tenure of Benazir Bhutto. Upon his arrival 
we had a meeting, and I clearly told him that they were talking 
about something which just did not exist on the ground. I 
pointed out that was definite tension between India and Pakistan 
between what was happening and what had been happening in the 
valley, and with the troops on the Line of Control in Kashmir. 
The hotline between GHQs of India and Pakistan had been fully 
functional, every second of the day. We were in conversation 
with them knowing exactly what was happening without even going 
to the second stage of tension, which leads to a state of 
conflict between the two countries i.e., deployment of 
conventional forces. 
  The US had reached the conclusion that Pakistan was 
preparing 
for a nuclear attack on India on the basis of pictures 
circulated via satellite, showing troop loads of material from 
Kahuta moving outwards, F-16s from various bases being placed at 
suitable air bases for striking India, and activity in and 
around Quetta where they thought there were some nuclear 
facilities which Pakistan had created. Thus painting a picture 
as if Pakistan was ready to strike India. 
  What needs to be understood here is the motive behind 
creating this false image of Pakistan by the Indian lobby. 
Firstly, it was to divert attention of the world from Kashmir, 
because if there is a possibility of a nuclear holocaust in the 
subcontinent naturally everyone will forget about what is 
happening in Kashmir and all attention will be directed towards 
this major issue. 
  The ground realities are that in 1989, immediately after 
Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto took over, a meeting of the National 
Nuclear Command Authority (NNCA) was held. The NNCA was 
established by late Mr Bhutto when he first initiated the 
programme, and he became the chairman, being the chief 
executive. Later on Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the Chief of the Army 
Staff and three other people who are involved with the programme 
formed the Nuclear Command Committee, 
  This committee formulates all the policies. In January 
1989 under the then president this committee met, the prime 
minister was there, I was there and having analysed the problems 
in detail we thought that there was a need to adopt a policy of 
restraint to limit our nuclear programme. Because we thought 
that Pakistan had acquired the maximum deterrence level that is 
needed to avert the threat that we perceived, and it could also 
quantify, for example the correlation of forces between India 
and Pakistan, i.e., conventional forces. 
  Therefore, having reached the minimum deterrence level, the 
committee took a decision to limit one aspect of the programme 
which was uranium enrichment. If uranium is enriched to the 
maximum level of 95 per cent and above it becomes weapon-grade 
uranium. As there was no requirement of going beyond three to 
five per cent which is the level needed for our Kanup [Karachi 
Nuclear Power] plant, from the time this decision was taken, 
i.e. January 1989, Pakistan has been only carrying out 
enrichment up to three to five per cent. 
  Whereas the other processes, i.e. the R&amp;D for the 
development 
of the device and its refinement and development of the delivery 
system and refinement of the system, the test that has to be 
carried out in the lab and finally the safety measures for the 
security that have to be undertaken to ensure that there is no 
mismanagement are continuing. 
  Thus, the management, control, and safeguard measures are 
the 
responsibility of the National Nuclear Command Authority. Its 
job was and continues to be to institutionalise policy making 
and to determine the capability and the criteria as to what 
capability level we have to acquire. This authority also 
determines the state of readiness which has to be maintained at 
all times. By a state of readiness, I mean the device 
integration that has to be achieved because the device contains 
so many different items, consequently the preparation of all 
those items, then the ability to put them together and have a 
device ready when needed. This is an important decision. 
Related to this is the delivery system development, which 
somebody said can be catapulted. I am sorry, it cannot be 
catapulted. 
  It is a highly technical system and it has to be tested from 
time to time on computers and in the lab before you can really 
go in the field and carry out a real hot test. The delivery 
system, therefore, has to be developed. We already have the 
F-16s, Mirages and the M-11s which we are now getting from China 
that can carry, but there had been a problem in the past. Then 
through the missile programme, which I am sure they have 
continued with, we should have a delivery system with a very 
effective, accurate, guiding system, provided on the missiles. 
  There have been doubts about the designation of 
responsibility both with the country and outside. I would like 
to make it very clear that the NNCA is very definite in its mind 
and has very clearly designated the responsibility to joint 
operations centre (JOC), which is maintained in the Joint Staff 
Head Quarters in Rawalpindi which commands all the three 
services during war. The JOC is the first one to be given 
orders when it comes to deployment and utilisation of this 
capability. And, of course, the orders are then passed on to the 
other three services which are to take action, particularly the 
Army and the Air Force, as these agencies are involved in the 
development of the device. 
  With regard to safeguard and security measures, because of 
its sensitivity, foolproof methods have to be adopted for 
security of the whole system. The authority also lays down in 
great detail the policy of how the various components will be 
place, protected, and safeguarded. There are technical and 
procedural measures which are adopted to ensure that no mistakes 
are made. These procedures and technicalities are devised by 
NNCA, as they are a highly guarded secret. Therefore, to the 
best of our ability, we have developed technical and procedural 
measures to safeguard and provide safety to the material. This 
has been the case from the very first day the programme started. 
  There has to be a political chain of command. It was there, 
it has been there and continues to be there till today. The 
military chain of command starts from below where it is at the 
receiving end and carries out instructions as received from the 
political authority. The person who has the hand on the button 
is the chief executive. But the term "chief executive" has 
undergone several changes. When Mr Bhutto was alive, he had his 
hand on the button. when Gen. Ziaul Haq came to power, his hand 
was on the button and after him Ms Benazir Bhutto and so on. 
  The question is, now that we have acquired this capability 
what do we gain from it. In this context, I would like to read 
two statements. The first one I quote: "Pakistan's possession 
of Nuclear Weapons makes a large Indian conventional edge 
unexploitable. "The conventional edge implies the correction of 
forces, in which the Indian Army is three times, the Air Force 
five times and Navy ten times that of Pakistan's. They cannot 
exploit this situation because Pakistan possesses nuclear 
weapons. This is the first advantage that we have gained. And 
this is something that a former Indian Army Chief Sunderjeet 
admits in his statement, "On balance one may conclude that in a 
general low level symmetry between India and Pakistan a 
substantial degree of nuclear stability exists." 
  The fact is that if today there is stability, it is due to 
the possession of nuclear capability by both sides. I can count 
many advantages. It certainly has reduced the possibility of 
war. Although the option of going to war is not with the weaker 
but with the stronger one, but as the stronger's options are 
limited due to the possession of the nuclear weapon, therefore, 
India just cannot unleash its conventional weapons against 
Pakistan. That makes the possibility of war between India and 
Pakistan much less. 
  The question of cost effectiveness has been raised, which is 
something very surprising. When our project was at its peak in 
1985, 1986, 1987 the annual budget of Kahuta programme was less 
than the cost of one F-16. We paid about 28 million dollars per 
aircraft as against 18 million dollars, the actual cost, because 
we got it out of turn and we had to pay 10 million dollars extra 
for every aircraft. I am, therefore, talking of 18 million 
dollars and I say on good authority that the cost of one year's 
budget programme of Kahuta Laboratory is less than the cost of 
one single F-16 aircraft. 
  And from the time we received these F-16s, I think we have 
lost four or five of them and are left with only 34 or 35. So if 
somebody is thinking exchanging our nuclear programme with the 
F-16s -- 38 of them -- I am sure he is not aware of this reality. 
  Another advantage that Pakistan has in possessing a nuclear 
weapon is that India cannot indulge in nuclear blackmail against 
Pakistan since we have a meaningful capability. We took a 
decision, a policy of restraint as we thought that since we had 
reached the minimum deterrence level, we did not have to go 
beyond it. But it must be remembered that limiting enrichment 
of uranium does not cap your nuclear programme. If you are 
carrying out the enrichment of uranium up to five per cent, to 
take it to 20 per cent, perhaps you need about a week's time. 
If from 20 per cent, you want to take it to 95 per cent another 
10 days or so will be required only. Thus, within 15 days, if 
you want you can just raise the level to 95 per cent and you 
will be producing weapon-grade uranium. 
  This should make the difference apparent. First they were 
talking of rolling back, now they want Pakistan to cap its 
programme. This is a very major decision which Pakistan has to 
take, but in my judgement if it comes to that, and if there are 
great many advantages, then it has to be a move in symmetry with 
what India is doing. It has to be a simultaneous action 
guaranteed by the powers and thus bring Pakistan and India to 
understand the logic to cap their programme. They do not want 
us to roll back which is a big change, and I think if India 
agrees, Pakistan may decide to cap its programme.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Arab </F>
affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari in Cairo on 4 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Ya'ari] Beyond the signing of the agreement, 
when do you expect the actual transfer of power to take place? 
  [Peres] We are dealing here with a number of doors which 
have to be opened. Some already have been opened, and 
Palestinians will enter through them. I believe the formal 
transfer will occur within two to three weeks. 
  [Ya'ari] How do you assess the impact of this agreement on 
Israel's efforts to negotiate with Syria? Will it spur al-Asad 
on? Will it alienate him and convince him to wait? 
  [Peres] I will tell you something far-reaching: Without an 
agreement with the Palestinians, we would be unable to reach an 
agreement with al-Asad, because without that agreement, al-Asad 
would view himself as the sponsor of the Palestinian issue. The 
fact that the Palestinians are engaged in a process separately 
from the Syrians permits us to negotiate and reach an accord 
with each of them. 
  [Ya'ari] With your permission, I would like to address the 
most recent discussion you had last night with Yasir 'Arafat and 
the cosponsors. Can you tell us what happened with the 
remaining unresolved clauses of the agreement? 
  [Peres] As always happens in negotiations, they were 
concluded with a compromise, which is made up of firm pledges on 
the one hand and promises and expectations for the future on the 
other. All in all, I think the compromise is adequate from 
Israel's viewpoint, and from the Palestinian viewpoint as well. 
  We must not forget that this is a unique process: The 
negotiations are not over; a process has been launched, and it 
will continue. For instance, we never said the size of Jericho 
was final, as the negotiations on the size of Jericho will have 
to be resumed within a few months. Therefore, points on which 
agreement was achieved should be viewed in a time dimension, and 
not only a territorial dimension. I think this makes compromise 
easier for both sides. In any event, it was vital to conclude 
the agreement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at Masallatah on 2 </F>
May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] In continuation of the defiance 
festivities, and in affirmation of preparedness for 
confrontation and for standing up to the schemes of the 
crusading enemies who are hostile to the Arab nation and the 
Great Jamahriyah, the citadel of pan-Arabism and freedom in the 
world, and in entrenchment of the historic cohesiveness between 
the leader and the masses, the masses of Masallatah yesterday 
welcomed the brother leader of the revolution. They chanted 
loud slogans expressing the eternal ties between the masses and 
the leader of their revolution, the symbol of their pride and 
dignity, the builder of their civilization and the fulfiller of 
their dreams to live freely on earth. 
  Amid the masses rubbing shoulders with him, the brother 
leader of the revolution made the following address: 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] Brothers, we let them hear our voice once 
again from Masallatah, the beacon of knowledge and land of 
jihad. We let them hear our voice from this place which was the 
bridge through which the Italian occupation forces in 1911 tried 
to cross to Tarhunah and to the east, as they used to call the 
region. But the invading forces, brothers, could cross only 
over the bodies of your fathers and grandfathers in well-known 
battles. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers, we are proud of and cherish these eternal battles 
from our history. They give us inspiration to confront the new 
enemies, neo-fascism, the new crusade, the new Western colonial 
campaign. 
  We confront them today at a time when we are stronger than 
before, more numerous, with more equipment, and with more 
preparedness to face up to our enemies. [passage omitted] 
Brothers, we are stronger than before, and therefore our 
resistance will be more fierce, more violent than that of our 
fathers and grandfathers. 
  Their banners will never again be raised on this land. The 
banners of freedom will always float over this land. We are 
prepared to offer more sacrifices to impose our will on the 
greedy and the covetous. [passage omitted] 
  The free Libyan people are now defying those who are even 
stronger than Italy; it is challenging U.S. imperialism and its 
unjust allies. We here challenge the three isolated states 
which are swimming against the tide: the United States, Britain, 
and France. We challenge them here with, on our side, the 
peoples, the regional organizations, the international 
organizations, the strugglers for freedom in all the continents 
of the world. The United States, Britain, and France are 
internationally condemned states, internationally isolated 
states. They have no means other that the stick and carrot 
method, and using the Security Council by force, with falsehood 
and lies. 
  Thanks to your stand, O courageous Libyans, the three states 
America, Britain, and France are isolated and condemned. They 
are acting against the international community, against the 
United Nations, and they have nothing left before them except 
tearing up the UN Charter, trampling on international law, and 
making the Security Council vote by force in favor of their 
unjust resolutions. 
  The steadfast stand of the Libyan people has made the entire 
world support the wronged Libyan people, the Libyan people that 
have right on their side, the Libyan people that ask only for 
freedom on the land of their fathers and grandfathers. 
  We are facing big states, however they are isolated states; 
they are condemned by the international community; all the 
world's peoples are today cursing the United States, Britain, 
and France. 
  We are supported by the peoples of the Arab nation, even if 
their leaders have submitted, even if their leaders betray us, 
even if the leaders become weak. We are supported by masses 
that stretch from the Atlantic to the Gulf; you are supported by 
the peoples of the Arab nations; these people who own the veto 
right which has more power than the veto of the UN Security 
Council; the veto that the Somali people had used represents 
full evidence of what I am saying, brothers. 
  Let us raise our voices even higher; we are the people of 
the 
land, and right is on our side [words indistinct], we have a 
right to liberty, we have the right to live free on our land. 
We fight, brothers, we will do so with honor; we will fight 
with force because we will never relinquish the land of our 
ancestors. 
  As for the others, they will fight with dishonor, they will 
base their fight on experience; they will weigh up their losses 
and gains because they will be fighting on a land that is not 
theirs; they are the aggressors. Whereas we, when the time of 
confrontation comes, will be stronger than they; because we own 
this land; this land on which we walk is the land of our fathers 
and ancestors. 
  What is important, brothers, is that their feet will tremble 
on this land because they are aggressors and greedy people; we 
are not greedy, we only defend our right to live; whereas they 
defend the right to reap profits from uncalculated adventures. 
Let them try the confrontation with the Libyan people who are 
ready for this. 
  Brothers, I urge you to be ready to embark on the battle of 
confrontation and the confrontation of defiance using any type 
of weapons. Victory will be ours regardless.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has received an 
invitation from his Egyptian counterpart 'Amr Musa to attend the 
signing ceremony of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement. It has 
not been decided whether Lebanon will respond to the invitation. 
  Minister Buwayz today discussed developments in the 
bilateral 
talks in light of the talks that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher has had in Damascus and other concerned regional 
states. 
  Buwayz expects Christopher's current tour to result in an 
invitation to attend the 13th round of bilateral peace talks. 
He believes that the proposals submitted to Syria in the past 
24 hours are vague, because the Israeli proposal offers phased 
withdrawal from parts of the Golan Heights, starting with Majdal 
Shams. The proposals do not mention what will happen after 
that. Syria, he said, demands full withdrawal. 
  Buwayz added: I believe that Syria is not very enthusiastic 
about these proposals, because it wants to know how withdrawals 
will begin and end even if they are phased. From the 
information I got from Damascus in the past 24 hours, I got the 
impression that these proposals are not tempting. I do not want 
to sound pessimistic and say that they are the last proposals. 
They will certainly be followed by others. But the first round 
of talks in Damascus did not sound constructive according to the 
latest reports. 
  Minister Buwayz said that negotiations continuing for three 
years since Madrid have produced few results. The 
Palestinian-Israeli track produced the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, 
which remains a very modest achievement, he said, adding: This 
agreement mentions a 350-km square Gaza and Jericho and gives 
the Palestinians rights in municipalities. It involves no 
political rights. It also notes that Israeli military troops 
will continue to deploy at the entrance to Gaza and Jericho. 
  The foreign minister was talking to a delegation from the 
Netherlands including professors and students from the faculty 
of law. The delegation is currently on a tour that will take it 
to Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Jerusalem, and Gaza to get acquainted 
with the peace process and the progress it has made. [passage 
omitted] 
  As for the Lebanese-Israeli track, the problem looks much 
easier than it is. The Israelis say they have no ambitions on 
Lebanese land and water. This has remained mere talk in the 
media; it has not been interpreted in practical offers or 
proposals to withdraw during the ongoing negotiations. 
  Buwayz added: We propose that Israel announce and bind 
itself to the principle of withdrawal from the land it occupies 
in the south. This principle paves the way for setting up two 
security and military committees to study the necessary security 
measures in the south to guarantee peace and stability in the 
region simultaneously with the programed Israeli withdrawal. I 
believe the Israelis do not want to implement UN Security 
Council Resolution 425 because it does not involve a peace 
agreement with Lebanon. This resolution demands Israel's 
unconditional withdrawal from the Lebanese territory it occupies. 
  The foreign minister continued: The second reason that leads 
Israel to refrain from responding to Lebanon's demands is that 
it does not want to recognize the principle of military 
withdrawal until Lebanon restricts or suspends resistance 
activity. But the Lebanese stance on the Israeli viewpoint is 
the opposite; occupation can only be met with one of two things: 
Diplomacy, that is, implementing Resolution 425, or liberation 
by the army. Israel refuses the first approach and the United 
Nations has not put pressure on it to accept it. As for the 
second approach, the Lebanese Army is not militarily prepared to 
confront the Israeli army. 
  Hence the resistance was organized by the Lebanese people, 
who are entitled to restore their land as long as the state 
cannot do it. 
  Buwayz reiterated that resistance in the south is a result 
of 
the Israeli occupation. It will lose its justification once the 
occupier leaves, he said.

  [Text] The PLO representatives have reached agreement with 
the Zionist regime on maintaining security and dealing with 
judicial matters in Gaza and Jericho. On the basis of this 
agreement, the PLO police are not authorized to arrest or 
question the Zionists living in these regions, even if the 
Zionists sabotage security. On the other hand, the Zionist 
regime forces are allowed to arrest the Palestinians living in 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho, without handing them over to the PLO 
police. It has been arranged that Rabin, the prime minister of 
the Zionist regime, and 'Arafat, the PLO leader, should meet in 
Cairo tomorrow to finalize the outcome of the two sides' talks. 
Our correspondent in Beirut has interviewed the secretary 
general of the Palestine Islamic Jihad Movement [Dr. Shaqaqi] in 
Beirut on this meeting and the possible agreements at the 
meeting. We draw your attention to his report: 
  [Correspondent] Good evening, dear viewers of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's television news. According to the remarks 
made by the secretary general of the Palestine Islamic Jihad 
Movement, tomorrow is the day of signing the final accord on 
Gaza and Jericho in Cairo. This will be classed as another day 
of defeat in the history of the Arabs and Palestine. During a 
telephone conversation with the Central News Unit office in 
Beirut today, he said: The issue of Palestinian self-rule in 
Gaza and Jericho is nothing more than a tool in the hand of the 
Zionists; and establishment of such an autonomous government 
does not realize the aspiration of the Palestinian mojahedin and 
combatants to create a true Palestinian state and government. 
  On the role played by the Palestinian forces opposed to the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, Dr. Shaqaqi said: At this stage the goal 
of all the combatants should remain continuation of the struggle 
and jihad for the unchanging Palestinian aspiration. It is up 
to the forces opposed to the peace with the Zionist regime to 
compile a comprehensive and calculated plan to fight the Zionist 
regime, even if such a struggle were to continue for another 20 
years. 
  On the future of the intifadah after implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, he said: Far from being cxurtailed, the 
military operation will -- in my opinion -- intensify, even 
though continuation of the military operations under these 
circumstances will be difficult. We will, however, exert every 
effort.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 26 April 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Material, Human Support for Chinese Muslims Urged 
  2. Support for al-Azhar To Combat Religious Illiteracy 
  3. Refresher Course Held for Mosque Imams 
  4. New Course for Islamic World Imams and Preachers 
<H5>  MATERIAL, HUMAN SUPPORT FOR CHINESE MUSLIMS URGED </H5>
  In a 350-word column on page one, 'AQIDATI's board chairman 
Samir Rajab reports on his recent visit to China. He says he 
noticed this time that some of the Muslims there were more 
optimistic and hopeful regarding the future. He wonders whether 
the economic open-door policy in China has been extended to 
cover religious affairs as well. 
  After noting that this was a good sign, he says: "Frankly, 
unless the Islamic states act effectively over all this vast far 
region, the Muslims will lose some of the ground they have won." 
He warns that "we must support these temporary gains with our 
material and human resources." 
<H5>  SUPPORT FOR AL-AZHAR TO COMBAT RELIGIOUS ILLITERACY </H5>
  In a 100-word report on page two, Nadiyah al-Sayyid writes 
that the Specialized National Councils [SNC] under Dr. 
'Abd-al-Qadir Hatim have called for the need to place all the 
necessary resources at the disposal of al-Azhar so it can 
shoulder its responsibilities on the issues of the call and 
fatwa. This can be done by reviving the senior ulema committee 
or by reinforcing the effectiveness of the Islamic Research 
Institute, emphasizing its role in combating religious 
illiteracy and publicizing Islam's views on issues affecting 
modern society. "The arena must not be left free to incorrect 
interpretations by religious extremists." The SNC recommends 
that the Awqaf Ministry supervise publicly funded and built 
mosques and provide them with specialized preachers who can give 
correct religious education to the youths to steer them away 
from extremist ideologies. The SNC also recommends that 
consideration be given to limiting Friday prayers to major 
mosques "to avoid wrong interpretations and endeavors by Islamic 
extremists." 
<H5>  REFRESHER COURSE HELD FOR MOSQUE IMAMS </H5>
  In an unattributed 250-word report on page two, the paper 
writes that Awqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub and Deputy 
al-Azhar Rector Shaykh Sayyid Sa'ud have distributed 
certificates to 50 imams and scholars who attended a course for 
mosque imams from the governorates of Suez, Port Said, Ismailia, 
and Sinai. Dr. Mahjub explained that the course is considered 
"a big step to assist the scholars in discussing the current 
issues with the youths." The experiment will be extended to all 
governorates. 
<H5>  NEW COURSE FOR ISLAMIC WORLD IMAMS AND PREACHERS </H5>
  A 75-word report on page three says that the 25th course for 
Islamic world imams and preachers organized by al-Azhar will 
begin on 1 May. The course will be attended by 30 imams and 
preachers from Uzbekistan, Moscow, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Zaire, 
Liberia, and South Africa.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Husni Mubarak at the signing ceremony </F>
of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement at the 
International Convention Center in Cairo -- live] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  Yasir 'Arafat, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, dear guests, 
ladies and gentlemen: In the life of nations, there are 
historic moments that cannot be deleted by time or shrouded in 
obscurity. These moments always remain, handed down from one 
generation to another. The major developments witnessed by these 
moments have a deep and radical impact on the strategic 
interests and the basic rights of peoples. 
  In the life of the Middle East peoples in particular, there 
are unforgettable historic moments, moments that brought much 
hope and many dreams after much pain and suffering. They 
allowed the peoples of the region to continue their march toward 
peace and along the road of prophets, may God's peace and 
prayers be upon them, the prophets sent by God to spread virtue 
and right in the world and to cleanse hearts of hatred, vice, 
and rancor. God Almighty created man on earth to entrench the 
foundations of peace, to build and reconstruct, not to burn or 
destroy. Man was created to fill the universe with light, 
knowledge, and happiness and to eliminate coercion, fear, and 
darkness. 
  Today we are experiencing one of those historic moments as 
we 
see the signing of the agreement on the establishment of the 
Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho as part of the first 
phase of the Palestinian-Israeli peace. This proceeds from the 
Declaration of Principles that was signed in Washington. This 
step, therefore, is a culmination of hard and strenuous efforts. 
Many sides did all they could to turn general rules and 
principles into detailed, precise provisions that can be 
urgently implemented and can effect a revolutionary 
transformation in the reality of the Palestinian and Israeli 
peoples. 
  The Palestinian problem proved difficult to solve for 45 
years. Time only added more complications, hatred, and 
suffering. Many thought it had turned into a chronic problem 
from which there was no way out and that its obstacles could not 
be overcome. Calls of despair and despondency spread against 
the peacemakers and the instigators of hope. Many people 
thought peace was an unattainable objective. 
  But God Almighty provided the peoples of the region with a 
group of people who believed in their God and their mission on 
this blessed earth. They remained steadfast in their call for 
peace and sincere in their endeavor to achieve a just and 
honorable settlement that preserves a party's dignity and right 
to a secure life and protects its legitimate rights and 
interests in accordance with the laws accepted by the 
international community after centuries of experiments, 
successes, and failures. It was not strange to see this march 
on the course of peace led by great men and noble strugglers who 
have experienced war, lived through its horrors and atrocities, 
and witnessed the killing, the dismemberment, the burning of 
land and crops, and the spreading of ruin as far as the eye 
could see. These things were the result of war. It was natural 
for these heroes to turn their minds and beliefs from the war 
and its horrors and evils to peace with its hopes and broader 
horizons that would heal the wounds, resist annihilation, end 
the suffering and pain, and allow man to continue his noble 
mission worldwide. 
  This faithful group of heroic men undertook the task of 
working for peace to their last heart beat and of devoting their 
lives and hearts to turning the dream into a reality regardless 
of the sacrifices. They realized with their sound vision and 
deep wisdom that peace was the sublime objective of all peoples 
and that war was futile even if it brought a temporary victory, 
achieved an illusionary security, or changed balances. 
Ultimately it incites revenge and motives for retribution. But 
a just and honorable peace alone is the right course according 
to which everybody can live in security and safety. 
  The Arab people in Egypt were among the first to believe in 
peace as a goal and a course and as a moral commitment 
unparalleled by any other commitment. The Egyptian people have 
never been reluctant to sacrifice their lives, blood, and 
livelihood for the sake of a just and comprehensive peace that 
all the peoples of the area can enjoy and through which they can 
break the terrible vicious circle of bloodshed and the loss of 
sons and fathers. This was reflected in this people's 
steadfastness after the glorious October War and their firm 
decision to stand by peace when the late President Muhammad 
Anwar al-Sadat called for peace [applause] in Jerusalem in 
decisive terms that entered and touched every heart when he 
said: I did not come to you to conclude a separate agreement 
between Egypt and Israel. This is not part of Egypt's policy. 
The problem is not Egypt and Israel. Any separate peace 
between Egypt and Israel or between any one of the confrontation 
states and Israel will not establish a permanent and just peace 
in the entire region. Even if peace is achieved between every 
confrontation state and Israel without a just solution to the 
Palestinian problem, this will never establish the permanent and 
just peace demanded by the entire world today. 
  This, gentlemen, was Egypt's view of the problem and the way 
to solve it at that time. This policy continued to constitute 
its people's commitment throughout the years, even after it 
regained its territory and completed its freedom. The effect of 
all this made Egypt more capable of directing its attention to 
supporting its other brothers in their efforts to realize their 
hopes for a just and honorable peace, the peace of the heroes 
and the bold who can overcome the past and present barriers and 
move on to the future. Egypt has never felt that it was alone on 
this path, although it was lonely and often faced many 
difficulties. Egypt's faith that justice will triumph has never 
been shaken. It believes that ultimately the voice of peace and 
reconciliation will surge with a roaring force throughout the 
Arab world and in Israel. 
  The world's advocates of peace will support the peoples of 
the region in these hard years. They will back them and their 
right to look forward to a new era in which the peoples of the 
region get rid of fear, hatred, and suffering. 
  If other steps remain to be taken to achieve the 
comprehensive peace to which we have committed ourselves, this 
does not belittle the importance of this step and achievement. 
Each step consolidates the ones taken before it and paves the 
way for those to follow. The success scored by the peaceloving 
forces through the agreement we are signing and documenting 
today must encourage us to implement it honestly and in good 
faith despite all the difficulties we expect to find along the 
way, difficulties that we consider only natural. The step 
should also prompt us to redouble our efforts to achieve 
tangible progress and without delay on the other negotiating 
track. By doing this, we will be fulfilling our commitment to 
our brothers in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon and we will be 
performing our responsibilities toward ourselves and our 
neighbors in the region in which we live. 
  Guests and friends, our belief in the victory of peace has 
never been shaken for a moment. And it will not be shaken. Our 
struggle for peace has never stopped for a single day. It 
didn't take place one year and then not take place the next. It 
has been a continuous commitment and sharp observers can see 
that at no time in the past 10 years has it lacked a tangible 
addition that would help us to mark this achievement, which will 
continue to inspire our moves for other courageous steps soon. 
  It remains for me to point out that some of those events 
left 
greater impact than others along the road of peace. One of 
those developments was the convening of the Madrid peace 
conference through the commendable initiative of the United 
States and Russia, which volunteered to sponsor the conference 
and found broad response from all the parties to the conflict 
and from all the peaceloving forces in the world. The 
conference laid the foundation stone on a long road that was 
full of thorns and roses at the same time. 
  I believe that it behooves me to express the sincerest 
thanks and gratitude to U.S. President Bill Clinton and his 
efficient aides led by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. [applause] President Clinton kept the problem at 
the forefront of his attentions and priorities despite the 
urgency of other problems and their daily pressures. This 
undoubtedly stemmed from his belief that peace in the land of 
peace and the cradle of religions is the cornerstone of world 
peace and stability. 
  The Russian Federation under President Boris Yeltsin and his 
aides [applause], and we particularly mention Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev [applause], played a tangible role in supporting the 
peace efforts and in contacting the concerned parties at the 
critical times. 
  The EC played a role that cannot be belittled. Members 
exerted every effort to boost the peace process. They acted 
separately and collectively in the direction that led to 
completing the steps for the comprehensive and just settlement. 
This EC policy and concept was not unusual because they 
realized the mutual links between security and peace in the 
Middle East and stability and prosperity in Europe. 
  I do not need to express our thanks and gratitude for the 
Arab brothers who came to participate in this historic 
celebration, which we do not regard as a mere ceremonial and 
formal occasion, but as a living symbol of the entire Arab 
nation's choice of the peace course and its commitment to 
achieving it. [applause] 
  Due thanks also go to all the other friends who came to join 
this bright occasion appreciating its importance and expressing 
their support for its objectives and significance. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that all of you join me 
in addressing the sincerest expressions of appreciation and 
pride to President Yasir 'Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin. [applause] They have shown much courage and feelings of 
responsibility and proved that they have a far-sighted view 
around which has crystallized their determination to attain the 
goal amid strong challenges and pressures that are no secret to 
anyone. This is the essence of patriotic and moral commitment. 
  I salute with them this group of men who stood with them all 
along the course. These men enriched the process and added to 
it with their sound thinking, sincere work, and creative minds. 
I mention specifically Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and 
President Yasir 'Arafat's companions [applause] who shouldered 
the responsibility with him and performed it perfectly. 
[applause] 
  Now, my friends, we can cast our eyes on the far horizon and 
look toward a secure and happy future where the dream turns into 
a reality and the hope that has thrived in hearts becomes a 
tangible reality. 
  Doors have been opened, convoys have been set off, and the 
historic march toward peace in the land of peace has begun. 
  Palestinians and Arabs everywhere, Israeli supporters of 
right, justice, and life, march forward together. Do not be 
afraid. Get together. Do not be divided, so that your efforts 
will not be wasted. It is time to shake hands, cleanse hearts, 
reassure souls, bring interests closer, and to remove enmity, 
which spread in the region when time turned its back. It is 
time for us to direct our human and natural resources to what 
God has legitimized for us. It is time to reclaim land, mend 
what wars spoiled, build bridges, and spread development and 
progress in fields, farms, and factories. It is time to redress 
wounds, uproot hatred from souls, replace the tendencies of evil 
and revenge with love and fraternity, and plant roses instead of 
barbed wire. 
  This is not the choice of an individual or a limited group. 
It is the option and indisputable, unanimous decision of 
peoples. It is not the choice of one people to the exclusion of 
others. It is the choice of all peoples and all those who care 
for their present and future and realize the challenges. 
  If a people decides to have life, fate will inevitably 
respond; dark will inevitably vanish and shackles will 
inevitably break [Arab proverb]. 
  Let us proceed with God's blessing on the road of peace and 
good neighborliness. May Gad guide us and protect our march. 
Peace be upon you.

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the signing </F>
ceremony of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement at the 
International Convention Center in Cairo -- live; Kozyrev speaks 
in English with simultaneous translation into Arabic] 
  [Text] I would like to start by congratulating the Egyptian 
president on his birthday. I think, [applause] Your Excellency, 
that your foreign minister did not give you a present. But I 
believe that your being here amid this audience and this process 
to sign the agreement illustrates the prominent and leading role 
in the peace process played by your country under your 
leadership. I believe that the signing of the agreement in 
Egypt is very significant, because Egypt paved the way for 
reconciliation in the region. I hope that on your next birthday 
we will meet in the same hall with the same gathering to witness 
the signing of not only the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, but an 
agreement involving all the territory [applause]. By then we 
will have laid the foundations for three new pyramids: First, 
agreement on self-rule for the Palestinians; second, agreement 
for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, and I hope the 
Palestinians and Israel will cooperate; and third, comprehensive 
peace in the Middle East. We all believe that we can achieve a 
comprehensive peace soon by making progress in the coming 
dialogue and negotiations. 
  I believe that President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin 
know how much Russia wants peace in the region. This region is 
near to Russia. The trip from Moscow to this region is a 
four-hour flight, while the journey from Moscow to Vladivostok 
takes eight hours. We are eager to achieve peace and stability 
in the region. Russia would like to be a sponsor of this 
process along with the United States. I hope that this day will 
mark the start of the implementation of this agreement. There 
will be difficulties on the way but they must be overcome with 
good faith and resolve. 
  I congratulate you on this great effort today and I reassure 
you that Russia, the United States, Egypt, the European 
Community, and the whole world will be on the side of Israel, 
the Palestinians, and Arabs in the peace efforts. Thank you. 
[applause]

<F P=106> [Speech by PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas at </F>
the signing ceremony of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule 
Agreement at the International Convention Center in Cairo -- 
live] 
  [Text] Mr. President, gentlemen, today we have completed a 
difficult stage of negotiations on formulas, articles, and 
contexts to begin a more difficult stage in which to translate 
what we have achieved on paper into reality. We were lucky 
enough to meet today in Egypt, the country with the greatest and 
most profound experience in war and peace, to begin together the 
first steps on the path that we hope will lead us to our dream 
and the dream of generations, the dream of achieving a 
permanent, just, and comprehensive peace. 
  I register here for Egypt, the land of civilizations, its 
people, Government, and president, its essential and effective 
contribution to what has been achieved, a contribution that 
encourages us to be optimistic about the future when we all 
proceed together side by side to complete the process and 
provide the guarantees for its success. 
  Gentlemen, our people have chosen the path of peace and 
expressed this choice with the most sophisticated means of 
action. Their glorious struggle for peace was the subject of 
admiration by the entire world just as their steadfastness in 
the struggle for existence was an unparalleled miracle in this 
and any other age. 
  As we take the first and most important step on the ground, 
we realize that peace is not made through agreements and 
documents alone, but gains its vitality and viability by its 
ability to achieve the interests of peoples and by the extent to 
which it can match their daily needs and its relationship with 
their dreams. With this understanding, I would like to speak in 
the language of the future and address my words first to our 
Israeli partners, the other party to the equation and the other 
party with which we have long fought and with which we are 
trying now to shape new relations to end past calamities and 
tragedies to benefit peace and tranquility today and in future. 
  I tell our partners: You have fought long but even at the 
peak of your strength you never felt peace and security. Every 
day, every moment, there was something that disturbed and 
frightened you. This is because strength, however great it may 
be, can never cancel the feeling of the harm of isolation from 
your geographical and human environment and can never prevent 
the pain from the constant bleeding in your body and the body of 
those you are fighting. We have stretched our hand out to you 
to get rid of all the pains of the past. 
  You, and among you there are some who support the peace we 
are creating at this critical time and others who are against 
it, you shoulder the major part of the responsibility for the 
coming success or failure, God forbid. As we see it, your 
responsibility begins by getting rid of the old thinking that is 
full of fears and doubts and the endless search for guarantees, 
which affects the core of the interests of others, to replace 
them with a creative approach to tomorrow's requirements, in 
which your partners in the peace course will feel reassured and 
confident of the usefulness and permanency of cooperating with 
you. This has nothing to do with a new language we find 
ourselves speaking but with a new spirit that is reflected in 
behavior on every level. 
  You have achieved peace with Egypt, the biggest country in 
our Arab world. You are today trying to achieve peace with the 
Palestinian people, whose cause it is, a people at the center of 
the conflict. I do not doubt for a single moment your mature 
awareness of a self-evident truth that says that peace in our 
region cannot become firmly established and guaranteed without 
completing its interconnected links so as to see it also 
achieved with Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan in the clearest terms 
and fairest contexts. 
  While we feel increasingly confident when we hear about 
serious actions to resume the efforts to achieve peace with our 
remaining brothers, we do not hide from you our fears for 
everything that has been achieved if it is not completed soon 
with its other Arab links. 
  It has probably become clear to you and to the whole world 
that the essence and dimensions of the peace with the 
neighboring countries are not confined to the geographic scale 
of the regional map and its borders but are much deeper, because 
it should be a peace with the great nation, from the Ocean to 
the Gulf. Fears will remain and an inadequate, if not 
nonexistent, sense of security will remain if we do not put this 
at the center of our attention and efforts. 
  On such a day, I address our Palestinian people. Among them 
there is not one family that has not lost a martyr recently to 
the convoys of martyrs who have fallen since the start of the 
conflict and throughout every chapter and whose precious 
sacrifices have built the bridge to the peace station. The 
children of the intifadah and their sacrifices [applause] have 
ripened this historic moment. We tell our vibrant, alert, and 
very cultured people that we feel your pulse, share your fears, 
and understand your observations on the formulas we have reached 
between Oslo and this day. But with you we see an opportunity 
for a new coming together to wage a new experiment. How great 
it is to start with difficulty on the ground and how much more 
miserable it is to continue to easily adopt verbal slogans and 
remain confined by their restrictions. We will meet on the same 
ground to share in the sweetness and bitterness of our new life, 
to struggle to rebuild the society and homeland that has been 
exhausted by the long and bitter war and that has planted many 
illnesses in its heart. We will struggle together for the dream 
that will never leave us as long as we live, the dream of 
freedom and independence, the dream of the beautiful life for 
our children and grandchildren, the dream of the hopes and 
assuredness on the soil of our homeland, the dream of enjoying 
dignity under our sun and skies, the dream of the creative 
contribution to the building of our region and the consolidation 
of the pillars of its stability, and the dream of the creative 
cultural link with our Arab and Islamic nation and with the 
whole world, without wars and their calamitous requirements. 
  Yesterday when Nelson Mandela [applause] dropped his voting 
card in the ballot box we heard him say: I feel a dream has 
come true. Today we say we feel that the march toward our hopes 
has effectively begun. Still at the beginning of the road, we 
extend an intimate and loving call to our brothers who either 
reject, have reservations about, or have fears regarding our 
steps: Come to the house so that we can build it together, 
close the windows of evil together, make the best of the 
opportunity, and besiege the chances of danger with all our 
force. 
  We sincerely call for a national mobilization where efforts 
and capabilities are integrated to achieve our present and 
future missions on democratic bases and with a view toward 
building modern institutions that will ensure for our 
pluralistic society the best factors of progress and development 
and boost our national aspirations, only the first steps of 
which we have achieved, with all the factors that will allow 
them to be realized. Let us work together for the sake of 
repatriation, for Jerusalem [applause], on which we are about to 
enter negotiations, and for fulfilling the requirements and 
tasks of the final stage of the peace process in all its aspects. 
  The homeland we are hoping for is one for all the 
Palestinians. Let us build it on its soil, not on impossible 
slogans that only distance us from it. 
  On this day we address the new world, which is being shaped 
in a new climate and under new considerations, saying that the 
opening of the file of peace in the Middle East was the most 
courageous step toward building a new international order, or 
let us say new international life, on the rubble of the Cold War 
and its scores of destructive regional and civil wars. 
  The Middle East, which burdened the conscience of the world 
for half a century, troubling international interests and 
placing them at the mercy of instability, deserves further 
international efforts to entrench its new ambitious image. Any 
serious and effective contribution to ensure the stability and 
growth of this part of the world is, in essence, a vital 
contribution to the stability of everybody's interests in their 
every form and content. 
  Finally, we extend our appreciation to Warren Christopher 
[applause], who is joining us in celebrating these historic 
moments, and it pleases us to convey through him our greetings 
to the American people, the U.S. Administration, and President 
Clinton, who continued to work to achieve peace in our region. 
  I also greet Mr. Kozyrev [applause]. We are pleased to 
convey through him our greetings to the people and Government of 
Russia and to President Boris Yeltsin. 
  It is perhaps also useful to refer with appreciation and 
loyalty to the Government of Norway and to remember late Foreign 
Minister Johan Holst and his creative efforts [applause]. 
  We do not forget the positions and initiatives of every 
nation, each working as much as it could to support and sponsor 
the peace process. I particularly refer to our fraternal Arab 
Maghreb countries, which played a major and creative role in 
embodying the Palestinian character and its political reality, 
and also to our brothers in the Arabian Gulf countries, who, 
from the beginning, joined us in the peace process, on both the 
bilateral and multilateral tracks. I call on them today to 
translate the slogan of frankness and reconciliation into action 
on the ground [applause]. 
  I also salute our brothers in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, 
who 
are moving with us along the road of peace with great confidence 
and the fraternal cohesion that embodies the nation's interests 
and aspirations. 
  As we prepare to embark on the return trip to the homeland, 
we do not forget green Tunisia, its hospitable people, and its 
president, who protectively embraced us in the hardest of times 
and who honorably and fraternally supported us [applause]. 
  Mr. President, this is an additionally good act by you on 
your birthday. We congratulate you [applause]. We do not only 
say thank you; we will engrave this act in our hearts and will 
plant it on the boundaries of our homeland so that the 
generations will remember your position and noble work. Peace 
be upon you. [applause]

  [Text] President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani today received 
Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan. During this meeting 
the president referred to the incident of the Iranian plane 
crash in the Karabakh region as a bitter and unpleasant tragedy 
and stressed it would not serve the two countries' interests to 
leave the true cause of this tragedy unclear. Iran expects the 
outcome of the investigating team's work to be made available as 
soon as possible so as to inform the people of the two countries 
and particularly the families of the victims. Iran expects that 
if negligence is proved the culprit is punished. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to this incident as one of 
the sinister consequences of the futile war between the 
republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia in the Karabakh region. He 
added: Resorting to military force is not a suitable alternative 
for resolving the Karabakh dispute, and this war will have no 
military victor. 
  Stressing the need for finding a political and peaceful 
solution to the Karabakh conflict, the president reiterated 
Iran's readiness to help stop more bloodshed and homelessness of 
this region's people. 
  The Armenian vice president, in the course of this meeting, 
said the objective of his visit to Iran is to provide some 
explanations to the cause of the Iranian C-130 plane crash. He 
offered condolences and conveyed the deep regret of the Armenian 
Government to the Iranian Government and people, particularly to 
the families of the victims, and said: I will personally pursue 
this case until the cause of the Iranian plane crash is cleared, 
and I shall inform the Iranian Government of the outcome. 
  He also presented a report to the president on the latest 
developments of the Karabakh conflict.

  [Text] London, May 3, IRNA -- A UK parliamentary group, 
known to be actively involved in supporting anti-Iran 
terrorists, renewed its campaign of smears against the Tehran 
government Tuesday by trying to widen the offensive into an 
international conspiracy. 
  In a letter to THE TIMES, president of the so-called 
Parliamentary Human Rights Group, Lord Avebury, supported the 
paper's call for a "tougher policy" against Iran but made no 
mention of his links with mojahedin terrorists. 
  The close association of Lord Avebury and others, including 
the London-based United Nations Association Director, Malcolm 
Harper, in supporting the fomenting of anti-Iran terrorist 
activities come as an embarrassment for the UK in making fresh 
smears against Iran. 
  A new propaganda campaign was launched last week by Foreign 
Office Minister, Douglas Hogg, claiming that the Iranian 
intelligence service had connections with the IRA, who are 
waging an armed struggle against British rule in Northern 
Ireland. 
  Hogg himself has been accused by the friends and family of 
human rights solicitor, Patrick Finucane, of being at least 
partially responsible for the 1989 assassination of the Belfast 
lawyer by loyalist terrorists. 
  One of the focuses of Lord Avebury has been to promote the 
image of mojahedin terrorists and to present the Iraq-based 
grouplet as a `legitimate' opposition movement under the banner 
of `The National Council of Resistance of Iran.' 
  Last month, he was photographed by an MKO publication 
meeting 
one of its leaders, Maryam Rajavi, for two-hours at her 
residence in France. He was quoted "praising" the policy of the 
terrorist group. 
  In the same publication, a review was made of numerous armed 
attacks and bombings carried out by the terrorist group in Iran 
over the past year. The group has been responsible for hundreds 
of innocent lives since failing to overturn the 1979 Islamic 
revolution. 
  A report published by the so-called parliamentary human 
rights group in March, entitled `The Tehran Murder Machine,' 
like Amnesty International reports, is understood to be largely 
based upon the propaganda disseminated by the terrorist group. 
  Lord Avebury's letter to THE TIMES Tuesday was also seen 
containing many of the crudities of the MKO literature both in 
language and in allegations. 
  Other political groups, including the Labor Party, which in 
the past have supported the MKO, have generally distanced 
themselves from their known associations with the terrorist 
group, since its headquarters were moved to Baghdad in the late 
1980. 
  Many MKO members are still harbored by the UK, and even 
allowed to parade their literature that has included explicit 
instructions on making bombs and explosives that apparently have 
been ignored by the British campaign against terrorism.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Engineer Mohaqqeq: "The West's Formulas for </F>
Propaganda Against the Islamic Republic of Iran"] 
  [Excerpts] The campaign to deceive world public opinion 
and mold minds to serve Western interests, spearheaded by the 
United States campaign in favor of Zionism and against Islam, is 
among the most important policies of the United States, Britain, 
Zionism and its minions. They also make their greatest 
investment for this purpose. 
  The fact that the Islamic Revolution in Iran is the 
fountainhead of the awakening of the world Muslims and has 
openly exposed the true misanthropic nature of the United States 
has resulted in ever increasing expenditures in the cultural and 
propaganda fields against Islamic Iran. Extensive efforts are 
being made to distort the image of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  The motto of all the Western mass media, which are 
controlled 
by the psychological warfare centers, is: "In order to belittle 
the message of the Islamic Revolution and prevent them having 
any effect on world public opinion, accusations should be heaped 
on the Islamic Republic of Iran." This design has been 
implemented comprehensively and regularly in the past 15 years; 
and on certain occasions, its intensity and volume have even 
been increased. 
  Whenever world public opinion or a Western country becomes 
suspicious of the conduct of the government of one of its 
subservient countries and lodges a protest, the Islamic Republic 
of Iran exposes the facts effectively; and for this it is 
subjected to accusations. The following examples will help in 
understanding this: 
  When an Arab reactionary government takes a step in the 
direction of despotic Israel, its main concern is about Iran's 
objections, the propaganda from our press, and the spreading of 
their message to the Muslim nations. As a result it fears the 
protests of the public in the Muslim countries and seeks some 
recourse. On such occasions, the Israeli, Western, and Arab 
media make concerted accusations that the Islamic Republic of 
Iran has covert relations with the Zionist regime. These 
accusations are then disseminated in the Arab media, especially 
in the headlines of the country that intends to take a step in 
Israel's direction. 
  Usually such items are carried in some remote corner in the 
Israeli publications, are then cited by Western media, and then 
are picked up by the Arab reactionaries and flaunted 
extensively. Of course in the West, such reports are only used 
to the extent that the target country (the Arabs) can quote 
them. [passage omitted] 
  Today the West's involvement in the massacre of the Bosnian 
Muslims is clear to all. Today, as before, the voice of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran is the most outspoken in denouncing the 
collusion of the West and the Serbs. And now the West is 
seeking to justify its shortcomings with regard to the Bosnian 
Muslims to the world public. 
  The West does not wish to have its collusion with the Serbs 
mentioned and exposed, and so continues its propaganda to 
conceal its true visage. However, the voice of our people and 
government officials is loud. Therefore we should anticipate a 
spate of hostile propaganda against ourselves in accordance with 
their aforementioned pattern. 
  Soon they will unleash a deluge of stale and baseless 
accusations against our country which will not necessarily 
pertain to Bosnia-Herzegovina. It could be a false claim of 
some counterfeit U.S. dollars, unfounded allegations that Iran 
is attempting to manufacture a nuclear bomb, or charges that 
Iran is a danger to its neighbors. Perhaps they will find some 
new pretext regarding the violation of human rights in our 
country and may persuade the so-called human rights 
organizations such as Amnesty International to issue a statement 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran. They may even attribute 
to us the downing of some plane of theirs or an explosion in a 
commercial building in New York to us. They can resort to just 
anything. 
  The United States needs to accelerate its campaign of 
accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran, but now 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has also raised its voice. The Bosnian 
president has called for the resignation of the UN secretary 
general and has exposed the West's shortcomings in defending the 
honor and lives of the Bosnian Muslims. [passage omitted] 
  The U.S. defeat in Somalia, the rise of Islamism among the 
people of the Islamic countries, conditions in Algeria and 
Egypt, the Islamic Resistance Movement in Palestine, the 
struggle of the Muslim people in Lebanon, the dissolution of the 
Soviet Union, and in particular, the tragedy of the Bosnian 
people in the heartland of Europe are all manifestations of 
divine radiance overwhelming the darkness of heresy.

  [Text] Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- Interior Minister 'Ali 
Mohammed Besharati said here today that the lack of credibility 
of the United Nations and its Security Council has become the 
"problem of the 20th century" and considered it as damaging to 
the Secuirty Council. 
  Besharati in his meeting with the Australian Ambassador 
here, 
Nicholas Warner, referred to injustice in the Security Council 
and said the Senate of the U.S. in contrast to the view of its 
government is calling for the lifting of arms embargo on B-H 
[Bosnia-Herzegovina] and "this indicates the depth of the crisis 
which will lead the West to deadlock." 
  The UN Security Council under pressure from the United 
States 
and other Western powers is refusing to lift the arms embargo 
against the aggressed Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina despite the 
demands by Islamic countries including Iran. 
  The interior minister told the Australian ambassador that 
"what our people want is human rights in the real sense of the 
term and what the Westerners are after is a particular culture 
that has led them to a dead end." 
  The two also reviewed bilateral ties, with Warner 
emphasizing 
on the necessity of expansion of Iran-Australia cooperation. 
  Warner described the latest situation in Australia and said 
that exchange visits between the officials of the two countries 
and exchange of opinions can be effective in expanding relations 
in such fields as political, economic and cultural. 
  Besharati replied that one of the ways of expanding economic 
relations was for Iran and Australia to identify their present 
capacities.

  [Text] Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- The catastrophe of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina shows that when the solution is not in the 
same direction with the policies and interest of each one of the 
permanent members of the Security Council they do not make an 
immediate decision to prevent that crisis even if it should cost 
the trampling on the rights of a nation. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi who made the 
above remarks in an interview with IRNA here today, said the 
talks between the United Nations secretary general and foreign 
ministers of the contact group of the Organisation of the 
Islamic Conference (OIC) on the Bosnian crisis, confirmed for 
the first time in UN history, that the Security Council's 
problem of making decisions for solving disputes has not only 
been the characteristic of the Cold War era and the East-West 
dispute, "but the standard and the yardstick has been the 
interests of the permanent members of the Council that has made 
decision-making difficult and sometimes impossible." 
  He added that the OIC contact group with political and legal 
reasoning drew the attention of the Security Council to the 
tasks it has for peace and defending the rights of the peoples 
on the basis of the principles and goals of the UN Charter. The 
group criticized that failure to meet those goals has led to the 
weakening of sovereignty and the ethnic-cleansing in Bosnia. 
  The group maintained that in the post Cold War era following 
the previous policies is unjustifiable. 
  According to Mohammadi, the second issue is that the 
Security 
Council for the first time during two years of bloodshed in B-H 
and the efforts of the 51 Muslim countries and their solidarity 
in defence of Muslim rights, realized the presence of some new 
form of racial discrimination in the west similar to South 
African apartheid, and the frankness in the speeches of OIC 
ministers to which the secretary general has referred, naturally 
cannot be without effect in activities and future decisions of 
the Security Council. 
  Asked by IRNA whether the West intends to weaken the 
solidarity of Muslim states, he said obviously the establishment 
of this kind of Islamic solidarity in defending the Muslims of 
B-H was unexpected both for the Security Council and certain 
western states. 
  The spokesman said Iran has always made efforts at the OIC, 
the UN and the Non-Aligned Movement as well as in bilateral 
relations with other countries to prevent the savage ethnic 
cleansing and violations of international norms. 
  "Certain Muslim countries, too, have been harmonious with 
such positions and the formation of the OIC contact group at the 
UN in New York was based on the same common positions and 
Islamic solidarity," he added. 
  He commented that public opinion in the Islamic world is 
opposed to the inaction of international bodies against the 
crimes of Serbs and thinks that some type of new apartheid in 
the West is being formed which unlike the past is not only based 
on racial discrimination but also includes some sort of belief 
discrimination and for this reason they have the right to 
support those who share the same religion with them. 
  Questioned whether the British Government's allegations that 
Iran is supporting the Irish Republican Army (IRA) could colour 
Security Council decisions, he said: "Obviously that is not 
without relation. because Britain is among the permanent members 
which has always tried to consider the issue of Bosnia outside 
of the Security Council and by negotiation between the aggressor 
and the aggressed. This measure will cause both the lengthening 
of the time for decision making against the aggressor party and 
also the loss of many concessions and much human loss for the 
people of Bosnia- Herzegovina." 
  The public opinion of the Muslim world has been much aroused 
due to the deterrent policies of Britain in the Security Council 
and even NATO against the crimes of Serbs, he added. 
  "The judgement of Muslims about Britain is that the policy 
makers in London are the factor responsible for defeating any 
measure against the Serbs and opposed to any plan that 
guarantees the rights of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina of 
which David Owen's plans are some typical examples," said the 
spokesman. 
  He said "London's unfounded claims emanate from internal 
problems and from the weakness to overcome those problems. 
Therefore, the traditional practice of these countries at the 
time of internal crisis is to show the foreign relations as 
being acute and divert the public opinion from the internal 
situation to the external situation in order to whitewash 
(internal) problems." 
  According to Mohammadi another incentive of British 
authorities for bringing up such false matters is the fruitless 
efforts of London and Washington for isolating Iran. 
  "After this much investment we see that the common policy of 
the United States and Britain has been isolated among Europeans 
and Japan. Therefore, the propaganda machinery of Britain, 
simultaneously and awkwardly comes up with the propaganda of 
Iran having connections with the Irish Republican Army, and the 
training of Japanese nationals for terrorist operations in 
Europe. 
  "The main goal of such propaganda, is to affect the 
cooperation based on mutual interests of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran with those countries," he added. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman said the London sources know 
well that the Islamic Republic of Iran is opposed to terrorist 
operations and violent acts in their various forms, and even 
cooperates with some countries in the direction of fighting this 
dangerous phenomena that was created by the West. 
  Asked to comment on the invitation to Iran for negotiations 
with the United Arab Emirates [UAE] that was in the communique 
of the joint session of the U.S. secretary of state and the 
countries of the Persian Gulf the spokesman said: 
  "We have always announced our readiness to remove 
misunderstandings with UAE, without any preconditions, within 
the framework of the letter of the head of the state of UAE 
Sheikh Zayed to the president of Iran. 
  "We consider bilateral talks for strengthening of good 
neighborly relations and provision of collective interests in 
the region which has united our security and interests. 
However, since we believe that outsiders seek their interests 
in creating unrest in the region and the surfacing of disputes 
between Muslim states, to involve them in the task of removing 
misunderstanding will not help solve the problem but it will be 
in the direction of their filthy intentions." 
  Asked for latest information about the status of Iranian 
diplomats kidnapped in Beirut way back in 1982, he said the 
Foreign Ministry through the Iranian ambassador to Beirut had 
officially called on the Lebanese Government to precisely 
consider the fate of the four Iranians, the longest held 
hostages in Lebanon. 
  Mohammadi said the measures have been taken in the wake of 
the arrest of Phalangist militia chief Samir Geagea, and the 
Lebanese Government, too, has assured to investigate the issue 
which, he said, is reason for hope on the Iranian side.

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] The fifth session of the multilateral talks on the 
limitation of arms in the Middle East opened in Qatar yesterday. 
The three-day talks are to be attended by 43 countries, 
including the Zionist regime, most of the Arab countries, and 
representatives from the United Nations and the European Union. 
The topics to be discussed at the session will be the 
limitation of arms in the Middle East and freeing this area of 
mass destruction weapons. 
  The Middle East is one of the areas where a large volume of 
conventional and nonconventional arms are being stored. A large 
part of these arms, which are mainly nonconventional, are in the 
Persian Gulf countries, while another part--consisting of both 
conventional and nonconventional arms--are stored in Israel. 
These arms are produced by Western countries, especially the 
United States, which is creating threats in the region and is 
thus flooding its arms into this area to free itself from 
economic bankruptcy and create regional tensions. 
  What is noteworthy in this session is the Zionist regime's 
participation. It is said that this regime has more than 200 
nuclear warheads plus advanced non-nuclear weapons. Also, the 
Zionist regime has not joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact 
and the Disarmament Pact, which most countries have accepted. 
The Arab countries in the Persian Gulf also carry out one-fifth 
of the world's arms transactions, and one-fourth of their oil 
income goes to buy these arms. 
  Thus, even though disarmament is a favorable issue in 
principle, speaking about disarmament will be meaningless in 
view of the increasing trend of arms production and arms 
purchases, both by the Arab countries and by Israel, and one 
cannot speak of disarmament while increasing arms purchases. 
  Meanwhile, the non-Middle East countries participating in 
this conference are countries who enjoy large incomes from arms 
sales. Thus, in drawing a logical conclusion it is impossible to 
have a positive outcome from two negative points. 
  Thus, the convening of the Middle East peace conference [as 
heard], which has caused heated arguments in the Arab and 
Western mass media, can only be a mask covering the illogical 
steps made by the participants in the arms conference. Israel 
is benefiting from all this both by covering up the arms it 
manufactures and by portraying its participation as a gesture of 
goodwill toward the Arab countries to consolidate the Middle 
East peace process.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Hoseyn Qasemi: "From Tel Aviv to Muscat"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The three-day meeting on water in the Middle 
East, which was held from 17 April at the Muscat 
Intercontinental Hotel with the participation of 44 delegations, 
included a high-level Israeli delegation. When it concluded, 
political observers described it as more of a political meeting 
than a technical one. This is because for the first time the 
despotic regime of Palestine was permitted to participate in an 
intraregional conference held in one of the Persian Gulf 
countries. This broke the traditional boundaries between the 
said regime and the conservative Arabs of the region. 
  The Omanis do not seem very pleased with such an appraisal 
by 
political observers, because they sought to project the 
invitation for Israel to participate in the Muscat session as 
being within the framework of "a specialized task and to use 
that regime's experiences with regard to water use and nothing 
else." However, in a calculated move the Israelis sent their 
deputy foreign minister, Yosi Beilin--who is known for 
participating in covert talks--as head of the delegation, along 
with 19 correspondents. 
  These preliminary actions indicate that although the topic 
of 
the meeting is water, this was merely a pretext for implementing 
a political purpose. Thus, Beilin's mission can be construed as 
part of the moves known as "confidence-building measures" in 
order to create a psychological atmosphere in the Persian Gulf 
region. [passage omitted] 
  Perhaps at first glance the connection between the 
longstanding intention of the usurpers of Jerusalem to dominate 
the area from the Nile to the Euphrates and the holding of this 
conference on water may not seem very clear. However, if we 
think about it deeply we will see that they are steps in the 
same direction. This is because, with the Jewish government 
gaining a foothold in the Persian Gulf region and access to the 
markets and economies of the shaykhdoms in this region, this 
entity and its territorial covetousness can get a desired show 
case. Thus, in a way it can have the reins of the Arab 
reactionaries from the land of the Nile to the shores of the 
Euphrates at its disposal. 
  The reactionary Arab shaykhs and rulers are fully aware that 
the breeding and multiplication of an evil spore such as Israel 
in the region will naturally pave the way for the infiltration 
of neocolonialism, the forerunners of which imposed that old 
Methuselah called colonialism on the people of the region in 
bygone centuries and in this century too. 
  However, the real loser in this imbalance will be the same 
shaykhs and rulers who have been exposed by the Islamic 
awakening and who see their hereditary governments being swept 
away by the wind. The Islamic awakening will wipe out this 
neocolonialism when it comes into the arena with its sword, and 
it is here that yet another intifadah will emerge.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] Hajj is the meeting point of a large gathering 
of Muslim ummah from all parts of the world in a place of 
worship, full of devotion, and to secure the true identity and 
sublime human and divine position. Hajj pilgrimage means being 
liberated from oneself and joining good. Stepping over whims 
and desires, climbing the summit, the knowledge, and cleansing 
the soul from all pollution and adorning it with all kinds of 
beauties [passage omitted] 
  Alongside religious and worship proportions, hajj rituals 
also seek to explore and examine the problems and difficulties 
of the Islamic community in various political and social areas 
and to talk out plans to counter the enemies of Islam. Those 
involved in the administration of the Islamic communities, along 
with religious scholars and leaders, come together with all 
parts of the world in hajj rituals. While renewing their pledge 
of Islamic brotherhood, they embark upon deliberation and 
discussion to find appropriate and comprehensive solutions to 
the problems of the Islamic community, thus boosting 
international Islamic relations and levelling the ground for 
ever greater unity and solidarity in the world of Islam. 
  Meanwhile, the important point is the gathering of the world 
Muslims in the ceremonies of deliverance from infidels, which 
enjoys special status and importance in hajj rituals. 
Deliverance from infidels is a divine tradition, whose 
performance is rated as one of the important obligations of hajj 
pilgrims. During these ceremonies, the Muslims come together 
and publicly voice their detestation towards the polytheists and 
the oppressors throughout the world. 
  The fear of the anti-Islamic statesmen encountering this 
Islamic tradition lies in the fact that this act is considered 
as the political spirit of hajj rituals; and it is indeed so. 
The world hegemonist powers always seek to encourage the 
Muslims to center their attention merely on the religious and 
individual aspects of the religion of Islam and constantly 
attempt to reject the political dimension of Islam as null and 
void. However, as it is inferred and understood from the 
Islamic knowledge and also from the history of advent of Islam, 
the religion of Islam is intertwined with politics, and those 
Muslims who fail to take into consideration various aspects and 
dimensions of their faith are not proper Muslims from the 
Islamic point of view. Hence, the real and concrete hajj is the 
hajj all of whose rituals, including declaration of deliverance 
from infidels, are fulfilled properly.

<F P=106> ["Text" of "exclusive" interview with Musavi-Nezhad, </F>
director general of internal security at the Information 
Ministry, by unidentified IRNA correspondent; place and date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] The director general for internal security at 
the Information Ministry Musavi-Nezhad participated in an 
exclusive interview with the IRNA correspondent and answered 
questions on some terrorist actions inside Iran. The text is as 
follows: 
  [IRNA] What are the results of the follow-up by the 
Information Ministry regarding the assassination attempt against 
the acting Mashhad Friday imam, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin 
'Aba'i? 
  [Musavi-Nezhad] On 22 April Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin was 
attacked by an armed person from among those praying after the 
Friday prayers ended. An investigation revealed that the 
assailant was named 'Ali Huri Papi, from Haft Tappeh in 
Khuzestan Province, who had joined the Monafeqin [meaning 
hypocrites--pejorative term for Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, 
MKO] and had managed to acquire a Makarov through some common 
acquaintances. The Monafeqin continue their armed terrorist 
actions because of their inherent nature, as they have not 
evolved a definite political form. [passage omitted on previous 
MKO operations]. 
  [IRNA] Where did the arrest of Sa'idi-Sirjani--the 
well-known writer of the idolatrous [shah's] era take place? 
Could you give us some details of the inquiry that has taken 
place and its outcome? 
  [Musavi-Nezhad] Sa'idi-Sirjani was arrested along with 
another person Mohammad Sadeq Sa'id, alias Niaz Kermani. He was 
traced to a network of drugs and immorality and was arrested by 
the antidrug officials. Both have confessed to their guilt. 
However, after an investigation into their past records, Sa'idi 
and Niaz Kermani were found to have links and collaboration with 
the SAVAK and were handed over to the Information Ministry. 
  According to the SAVAK documents, Sa'idi-Sirjani has a shady 
past and was mentioned in these documents as one who had been 
reporting about revolutionary and combatant elements to the 
SAVAK. In a letter in 1348 [year beginning 21 March 1969] 
written to the SAVAK, he clearly admitted to writing in favor of 
the shah's regime and of cooperating with the SAVAK. There is 
also evidence of his links with foreign intelligence services. 
  Niaz Kermani was also a SAVAK official and continued his 
links with the covert network of SAVAK elements even after the 
victory of the revolution. For quite some time, he has been 
living in hiding since the discovery of a coupist network [not 
further identified]. Both the accused have admitted to the 
following charges in the interrogation: 
  1. The transport, distribution, and use of narcotics and 
inducting new members into the network in Kerman and Tehran by 
means of clandestine agreements according to which the drugs 
were delivered to them. 
  2. The production, storage, and distribution of alcoholic 
beverages. 
  3. Indulging in immoral, obscene, and homosexual orgies 
codenamed "Kashk va bademjan" [literally dried curds and 
eggplant]. 
  4. Links with the network of former SAVAK officials involved 
in the Nowzheh coup attempt, planting bombs, and membership in 
the espionage network of the Rafizadeh brothers in the United 
States. 
  5. Receiving considerable sums in foreign exchange from the 
counterrevolutionary networks based in the United States and 
Europe and foreign remittances which were deposited in 
Sa'idi-Sirjani's accounts in the United States and Britain. 
  [IRNA] At the conclusion of the interview, the director 
general for internal security of the Information Ministry 
clarified that the inquiries are continuing in order to identify 
their internal and external links. The outcome of this inquiry 
will be divulged at a later date.

  [Text] This morning the Foreign Exchange Market Committee 
held a session chaired by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
According to a Central News Unit report at the session a report 
was submitted to the president on the latest developments on 
Iran's outstanding debts and the successes achieved. 
  Owing to the country's foreign currency reserves situation 
it 
was decided that, to fight the corruption perpetrated by foreign 
currency dealers and to stabilize the exchange rate, in addition 
to providing foreign currency for [the import of] goods which 
qualify for official bank rates, the banking system will 
provide, at 50 rials below open market rates, all the foreign 
currency required by importers who have registered, or will 
register, at the Commerce Ministry to import in return for 
export. The banking system will also purchase the foreign 
currencies earned from exports, if the exporters are willing, at 
the same rate. A Central Bank statement will be issued on this 
soon.

  [Text] The Ports and Navigation Organization [PNO] of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran is to reduce docking tarriffs at 
Nowshahr Port by 10 percent from 22 May to 20 March 1995 to 
expand trade with Central Asian countries and to encourage 
exporters. This was stated by the deputy minister of roads and 
transportation and PNO head in an interview with our 
correspondent yesterday. He said that Nowshahr's loading 
capacity has been increased and is about 1.5 million tonnes. 
  Commenting on the facilities extended for the transport of 
goods at Nowshahr Port, he said: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified PNO head] In 1372 [year 
ending 20 March 1994] we allocated more than 3 billion rials 
there to create a trade port for the imports and exports of 
Central Asian countries. As our dear people know, this port is 
the closest one to the capital, about 200 km away. Last year 
the port was equipped with high tonnage forklifts of 60, 45, and 
35 tonnes. One of the problems that this port faced was the 
bridges on the Tehran-Nowshahr highway, which trucks carrying 
high tonnage cargo could not pass. Also, transportation costs on 
this route were double the costs of other routes. But 
fortunately, with the repair and strengthening of these bridges, 
they are now ready for high-tonnage trucks. This will also help 
to decrease transportation costs by 50 percent. [end recording]

  [Text] The country's Scientific Research Council warned 
today that the irregular increase in the consumption of oil 
products and energy waste will threaten our country's oil 
exports and create more problems for the country's oil-related 
income over the next decade. 
  According to our correspondent's report, the Scientific 
Research Council's energy committee today issued a report 
entitled "Perspectives of Energy Research in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran" at a seminar in which lecturers, researchers, 
and the country's executive officials in the energy sector were 
present. The report says: It is estimated that our country 
consumes more than one million barrels of oil each day. Even 
with the present low oil prices, the country is consuming around 
$5 billion worth of oil each year. That makes the need to 
rationalize our country's energy consumption, to develop 
consumption patterns, and to expand research into energy saving 
unavoidable . 
  The secretary of the state Scientific Research Council's 
energy committee also said: If the country's present trend of 
energy consumption continues, we will need to build a new 
refinery each year and that would cost a yearly investment of 
more than $1.5 billion. He added: Savings of 5.5 percent in 
energy consumption is realistic and can reduce foreign currency 
expenditure equivalent to $1.5 billion for investment in 
refining oil.

  [Excerpt] As you heard earlier in the bulletin, ceremonies 
were held this morning, in the presence of President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, in Tehran's Hoseyniyeh-ye Ershad [prayer 
center in northern Tehran] to mark the 15th anniversary of the 
martyrdom of the eminent Professor Ayatollah Motahhari and in 
commemoration of all teachers. Let me draw your attention to a 
detailed report about the president's remarks in this ceremony. 
  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed that the issue of a 
dynamic theology [ejtehad-e zendeh] and a correspondence 
[entebaq] between Islam and the demands of the day, an issue 
which was first raised by martyr Motahhari, is one of the most 
fundamental bases and most important jurisprudential criteria 
required in today's society. 
  According to our correspondent, the president explained: The 
danger of ossification still threatens the Islamic revolution. 
Thinkers and knowledgeable people have the duty to clarify 
further for today's humanity the question of the balance 
[tavazon] between rationality and the divine Shari'ah as the 
basis of the reasoning underlying our revolution's progress. 
This task requires courageous and strong thinkers who can 
present pure Islam without fear. 
  The president added: Fatwas [religious edicts] and strong 
jurisprudential [feqhi] principles based on the requirements of 
the day are the object of concern of Islamic law-making. The 
fact that the Islamic revolution has remained upright and strong 
in the face of the most powerful enemies and is continuing its 
eternal life is due to the firmness of its ideological pillars 
and the correctness of its foundations and, consequently, to the 
correspondence of its principles to the requirements of the time. 
  He said: The Islamic government has now given a good form to 
our society and it has proven, by denying the idea of the 
incompatability between the principles of Islamic jurisprudence 
and the circumstances of the time and the advances made by 
today's civilization, that it is one of the most successful 
revolutions of the world. 
  In his remarks about the issue of the corresspondence 
between 
Islam and the requirements of the day, Mr. Rafsanjani stressed 
the importance of distinguishing these requirements on the basis 
of Islamic expertise and by qualified and knowledgeable people. 
[passage omitted noting Rafsanjani praised the late Motahhari 
and all teachers]

  [Text] Tehran, May 3, IRNA -- Armenian Vice-President Gagik 
Arutyunyan arrived here Tuesday on a two-day visit to hold talks 
with Iranian officials on the crash of an Iranian plane in 
Karabakh in March and to convey a message of condolence from the 
Armenian president to Iranian authorities. The Armenian 
official was greeted at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport 
by Iranian Vice President for Economic Affairs Mohsen Nurbakhsh. 
  Speaking to IRNA upon arrival, Arutyunyan expressed regret 
over the incident, saying expert teams from Iran and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) were still 
investigating the issue to find out the cause of the crash. The 
Iranian passanger plane was downed near Stepanakert region in 
Karabakh on March 17, killing all its 32 passengers and crew on 
board. The victims were families of Iranian diplomats in Russia 
and Iranian students abroad. 
  Arutyunyan said that there were many ambigious points 
surrounding the crash which would be unraveled after the experts 
completed their invstigations. He said the staff of Armenia's 
control tower had done their best to prevent the plane from 
flying off its route. He promised "if the staff of the Armenian 
control tower are found guilty of negligence they will be 
punished." Arutyunyan added that during his stay here, he would

  [Text] Mr. Gagik Arutyunyan, Armenian vice president, at a 
meeting with Hasan Rowhani, deputy Majles speaker, this 
afternoon praised the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
for its continual and earnest efforts to bring to an end the war 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia. He expressed the hope that the 
war would end soon, judging by certain visible signs. 
  Referring to the downing of the aircraft carrying families 
of 
Iranian diplomats in the Karabakh region, on behalf of the 
government and people of Armenia, he expressed deep regret about 
the incident. Stressing that the Armenian Government would stop 
at nothing to discover the cause of the incident, he assured: If 
the smallest evidence of negligence by the Armenian authorities 
comes to light the culprits would be severely punished. 
  At the meeting Mr. Rowhani described Iran's fundamental 
policy on stability and peace and prevention of any act which 
would disrupt stability. He said the friendly ties between Iran 
and Armenia were based on those principles. He stressed Iran's 
support for a fair and honorable peace in the region. 
  He described as unconvincing the reasons given so far by the 
Armenian Government regarding the downing of the Iranian plane. 
He expressed the hope that with the continuation of the 
investigation and the cooperation of the Armenian authorities 
with the Iranian team of experts, the unclear aspects of the 
incident would become clear to the Iranian nation. 
  He referred to the active presence of Armenian deputies in 
the Majles. He said expansion of parliamentary ties between 
Iran and Armenia should be considered within the framework of 
the expansion of mutual relations.

signed in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, today is important for 
the entire world.

region in many ways. 
  Stressing that the path taken has no return and that it will 
lead to peace and stability, Cetin said: This region which

now, to a great extent, allocate them to the development of the 
region and the peoples within the framework of cooperation.

country in the region, can make significant contributions to the 
Middle East which is being restructured.

the regional countries, Cetin expressed satisfaction over the 
fact that the 45-year old war has ended in peace. He described 
this day as a `historic' one.

  [Text] Cairo, May 4 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa called on Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
leader Yasir 'Arafat on Wednesday [4 May] to open an official 
channel through which Japanese aid could effectively help 
establish a Palestinian homeland, Japanese officials said. 
  Arafat, who helped bring about an agreement whereby his 
group 
would lay down its arms in exchange for self-rule for 
Palestinians, told Kakizawa he will supervise the process of 
setting up such a channel, the officials said. 
  The two discussed the issue at a breakfast meeting before 
the 
signing of the historic self-rule agreement between 'Arafat and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  The elaborate signing ceremony was attended by Kakizawa, 
U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev and other foreign representatives. 
  'Arafat expressed high expectations for Japanese yen loans 
to 
help finance the construction of infrastructure for Gaza and 
Jericho, from which Israel agreed to pull out its troops for the 
first time since the 1967 Middle East war. 
  The two met at the guesthouse for foreign dignitaries 
attached to the office of Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. The 
Japanese minister flew to Cairo Monday night on a weeklong trip 
for talks with Middle East leaders and Christopher. 
  Japanese officials quoted 'Arafat as asking Japanese 
economic 
assistance to help transform the occupied land into a prosperous 
country that could be dubbed the "Singapore of the Middle East." 
  'Arafat also said he was willing to fly to Tokyo for foreign 
aid talks, citing such specific fields of infrastructure as 
communications facilities, ports, airports and water resource 
facilities, they said. 
  Meanwhile, Kakizawa issued a statement on the historic 
self-rule agreement between Israel and the PLO. The statement 
spelled out Japan's pledge to actively aid Palestinians and 
Israel's neighboring countries in view of the latest agreement. 
  The statement also said, "Japan will extend active 
contributions in such fields as environmental protection, 
economic development and water resources development under the 
framework of multilateral talks for peace in the Middle East." 
  The U.S. has asked Tokyo to expand its economic aid to the 
occupied territories and neighboring countries to consolidate 
its fledgling move towards peace. 
  Meanwhile earlier on Tuesday, Mubarak asked Kakizawa to help 
step up investment from Japan, the officials said. 
  Kakizawa praised Egypt for mediating as a peace broker to 
bring about the signing of the historic self-rule agreement. 
  Kakizawa apologized for forcing the postponement of 
Mubarak's 
planned visit to Japan in mid-April due to political turmoil in 
Tokyo, where parliamentary business was paralyzed amid a bitter 
policy row among ruling coalition partners over tax reform and 
security policies.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhal Sela' and On Levi] </F>
  [Text] The PLO has ordered the cancellation of all 
contractual relationships between Civil Administration bodies in 
Gaza and Jericho and Israeli companies and public organizations. 
If this order is followed, the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho 
might find themselves cut off from the supply of essential basic 
services, such as electricity, water, medication, gasoline, food 
products, and other essential consumption goods. 
  The Israeli delegation to the talks on civilian issues was 
notified of the move by Attorney Jamil al-Tarifi, head of the 
corresponding Palestinian delegation. DAVAR learned this from 
senior members of the Israeli delegation. The order came as an 
unpleasant surprise to the Israeli delegation and caused grave 
concern regarding the immediate future. The Civil 
Administration had asked to hand over the management of the 
affairs under its jurisdiction in an orderly manner that would 
include an overlap and transfer of the services it currently 
provides to the residents of Gaza and Jericho. 
  Furthermore, according to the agreements in principle, the 
Civil Administration system was supposed to be handed over to 
the Palestinians in its entirety and continue working in its 
present form. According to the Palestinian development plan, 
changes in this system were to be made gradually, based on 
available budgets. 
  The Israeli delegates proposed that the contracts be 
canceled 
in a few months, after the autonomy administration begins 
operating and is well established, but the Palestinians rejected 
the proposal. In view of this, all suppliers and companies with 
which the Civil Administration had contractual relations have 
been notified that their contracts will be terminated as of 17 
May. 
  The residents of the territories, who know that there are no 
other sources that can provide the services, were also surprised 
by the order. In discussions with them, it became apparent that 
Palestinians from outside the territories who are participating 
in the talks on civilian issues do not have the slightest idea 
about how life is run in the territories. For example, the 
Palestinians from outside the territories did not know that all 
electrical power in the territories comes from Israel. 
  The contracts in question provide the legal framework for 
the 
establishment of business ties between residents of the 
territories and Israeli suppliers, through the Civil 
Administration. The supply of power to Gaza, for example, is 
based on a contract between the Israel Electric Corporation and 
the municipalities and local councils in the Gaza Strip, 
according to which those bodies and not private persons are the 
"consumers" of the service. If these contracts are terminated 
before an alternative source of power is found, Gaza will be 
left without electricity. 
  It was learned yesterday that, after they realized that it 
might cause distress in the coming several weeks, members of the 
Palestinian delegation expressed regret over their decision to 
cancel the contracts. Nonetheless, the contracts were not 
renewed and no new ones have been signed.

<F P=106> [by Taib Mahjoub] </F>
  [Text] Doha, 3 May (AFP)--Israeli and Arab negotiators 
clashed here Tuesday [3 May] on the first day of talks on Middle 
East disarmament aimed at halting the spiralling billion-dollar 
arms race in the region. 
  More than 40 states, including Israel and most Arab 
countries, were taking part in three days of multilateral 
discussions behind closed doors on a draft arms limitation deal 
for the region. 
  But trouble flared almost immediately as the Arab and 
Israeli 
delegations differed over how the talks should proceed, 
officials said. 
  A Western delegate said the head of the Israeli delegation, 
defence ministry director-general David Ivry, insisted "straight 
away that the session should adopt the draft, provoking Arab 
reticence." 
  An Arab delegate said: "Certain Arab participants, including 
Saudi Arabia, saw the proposed text as a political statement 
which has nothing to do with arms limitation." 
  The text specifies that arms limitation "must in no way come 
at the expense of one nation or provide advantages to another," 
and it must be approved "with the unanimous support of all 
parties concerned." 
  Under the terms of the 1991 Madrid peace conference which 
launched the disarmament talks, the draft declaration of 
principles on disarmament also includes a reference to "a 
reduction in the arsenals and personnel of the armed forces" in 
the region. 
  And it stresses that the Middle East should become an area 
where "weapons of mass destruction will be eliminated." 
  UN and EU envoys, as well as representatives of the United 
States and Russia, the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace 
process, were also attending the conference in the Qatari 
capital, held under tight security. 
  A Western delegate said: "The Arabs believe we must first 
agree on the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, while 
the Israelis insist the priority is to establish 
confidence-building measures in the region." 
  The Arab countries first want Israel to agree to practical 
measures on arms control, which should cover Israel's nuclear 
weapons capability. 
  Israel has vehemently denied that it possesses nuclear 
weapons, but Western experts have estimated it probably has up 
to 200 warheads. 
  "The fact that a state in the region possesses a nuclear 
strength perpetuates tension," said Qatari Foreign Minister 
Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani. 
  He urged Israel to submit its nuclear potential to 
international supervision, and called on it to sign the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  "Political stability in the region depends on an arms 
balance 
between Israel and the Arabs," Al Thani said. 
  A Western delegate said Israel "considers its technological 
superiority in defence matters is designed to ensure a balance 
in the region, as the Arabs have such great advantages in terms 
of population and territory." 
  In a bid to narrow Arab-Israeli differences, Western 
countries have proposed setting up collective structures 
including a crisis prevention centre to improve understanding 
and promote cooperation, a delegate said. 
  Russia has also suggested opening a regional military data 
bank "to exchange information on the state and position of 
forces and military manoeuvres in the region," another delegate 
said. 
  Ivry is heading a 21-strong team, the first to visit Qatar 
since the creation of Israel in 1948. 
  Informal talks between Arab countries and other participants 
are due to be held Wednesday on the sidelines of the main 
meeting.

<F P=106> [Report by Ashraf al-Faqiyy: "'Abd-al-Majid: Yemen Could </F>
Turn Into Another Somalia"] 
  [Text] Alexandria -- Arab League Secretary General Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has warned against turning Yemen into a new 
Somalia. He urged Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid to work to prevent a further 
deterioration in conditions in Yemen "and, hence, an unfavorable 
outcome." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH 'Abd-al-Majid revealed that there 
is a "wide gap between the Yemeni president and his deputy." He 
said that "a considerable part of this dispute is personal. The 
other part is to do with the union and ways of implementing its 
mechanisms, especially the Armed Forces, which have not been 
unified. This is the main reason for the clashes that have 
occurred there." He said that the existence of huge quantities 
of arms in Yemen threatens conditions there. He expressed his 
hope that "the two 'Alis will apply reason and respond to Arab 
endeavors to safeguard Yemeni unity." 
  'Abd-al-Majid returned to Alexandria the evening of the day 
before yesterday after a two-day visit to Libya, during which he 
met with Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. He also 
held a series of meetings with a large number of Libyan 
officials. The meetings dealt with the mechanisms of Arab and 
Libyan moves to end the Lockerbie problem. 'Abd-al-Majid 
pointed out that the moves will be conducted through the 
Security Council member states in order to urge them to accept 
the League's proposal regarding trying the two suspects at the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague in accordance with 
the rules of Scottish law and by Scottish judges. He added that 
"solving this problem is not easy, but it is not impossible." 
  He pointed out that the League's proposal "offers a legal 
way 
out for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 731." 
This "requires a new Security Council resolution on the 
acceptance of the Arab proposal by the parties to the 
Libyan-Western crisis." 
  He pointed out that the League will intensify its moves 
during the Nonaligned Movement conference to be held in Cairo 
this month and the African summit meeting to be held in Tunis in 
June. This move will be parallel with the Libyan move. He said 
that "Scottish law contains three options with regard to the 
verdict: guilty, not guilty, or not proven -- which offers an 
opportunity for a fair trial for the defendants." 
  'Abd-al-Majid described the U.S. and British rejection of 
the 
League's proposal "as an unjustifiable position." He stressed 
the need to avoid stepping up the sanctions against Libya and to 
adhere to the Arab solution. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that 'Abd-al-Majid yesterday began his 
contacts with the foreign ministers of the Arab seven-man 
committee entrusted with discussing the Libyan-Western crisis. 
He briefed them on the results of his talks in Libya. 
  'Abd-al-Majid renewed his call for eliminating weapons of 
mass destruction from the Middle East. He urged that an Arab 
summit on water should be held to tackle the problem of its 
scarcity. He also renewed his call for setting up an Arab court

Foreign Intelligence Chiefs Replaced in Military Reshuffle"] 
  [Except] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Three days before the march 
to be staged in support of the dialogue in Algeria, President 
Major General Liamine Zeroual yesterday made changes among 
commanders of the military zones and some senior Army posts. 
  No information has leaked about the new appointments and 
changes among commanders of the military zones. The names of 
the commanders who have been pensioned off are surrounded by 
complete secrecy. However, a high-level source has revealed to 
AL-HAYAH that Fadil Saidi, director of foreign intelligence, has 
been moved to another post and that Gen. Tawfik, chief of the 
intelligence organs, is still in his post. 
  The ALGERIAN NEWS AGENCY announced in the afternoon that 
Mohamed Douadah had been appointed director of national 
security, replacing Mohamed Tolba, who has been in charge of 
national security since January 1992. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algiers: Reports of Shabouti's Death </F>
and Makhloufi's Murder"] 
  [Excerpts] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Algeria celebrated Labor 
Day yesterday, days before the big march being prepared for to 
support the dialogue for which President Liamine Zeroual has 
called. The announcement of the formation of the Transitional 
National Assembly (an unelected parliament) has been postponed 
because of the major parties' refusal to participate in it. 
[passage omitted] 
  It seems that Annaba was selected for Labor Day celebrations 
to indicate that security forces are in control of the situation. 
  Southeastern areas of the capital witnessed large-scale 
combing operations yesterday. 
  Information from various sources indicates that security 
forces have killed prominent military leaders in the "armed 
Islamic groups" or the "armed Islamic movement." There are 
reports of the death of Major General Abdelkader Shabouti in 
Chelif (west of Algeria). He was the leader of the "armed 
Islamic movement" belonging to the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that Shabouti was in the Orous area 
suffering from an undisclosed illness. He was moved to west 
Algeria for treatment. Circles close to the FIS have not 
confirmed Shabouti's death. Nor have there been any reports 
that he has been "murdered." However, there are reports in some 
Algerian circles about his death. 
  Other information indicates that Said Makhloufi was killed 
"by mistake" during the recent siege imposed by security forces 
on Boumerdas. He was holding a coordination meeting between the 
armed Islamic groups and the armed Islamic movement. 
  The certain thing is that this information is still in the 
hands of security men and FIS leaders. It might be announced in 
the coming weeks. Some sources say the reason for neither 
confirming nor denying the two FIS leaders' death is to avoid 
obstructing current preparations for FIS supporters' 
participation in the 8 May march in support of the dialogue 
approach. [passage omitted]

in Egypt `the Muslim Brotherhood' (Ikhwan al-Muslimun) has 
denounced the signing of an agreement on limited Palestinian 
self-rule for Gaza and Jericho in Cairo Wednesday. 
  "We think those who are doing this are deviated and they are 
isolated from their people and from the will of their people. 
We are waiting to see what is going to happen in the future," 
Ikhwan-spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi told IRNA by phone from Cairo. 
  Al-Hudaybi spoke to IRNA from his hospital bed where he is 
recovering from an illness. The Muslim Brotherhood, the most 
powerful Islamic movement in the arab world, is strongly opposed 
to the so-called Middle East peace process. [passage omitted]

al-Sayyid and Private Sayyid Hammad Radwan of the Suhaj Security 
Directorate were hit by bullets fired by unidentified men in 
Suhaj today. An official security source added that while 
Corporal al-Sayyid and Private Radwan were walking in Suhaj this 
morning they spotted two strange men in a cafe in the railway 
station square. When they tried to check their identities, the 
two fired their pistols and fled. The corporal was hit in the 
abdomen by two bullets and the private by one bullet in his 
right arm. They were immediately taken to the Suhaj General 
Hospital. Commanders of the Suhaj Security Directorate and 
public security and investigation officers went to the scene. 
The security men have sealed off the area and are searching for 
the criminals and the Public Prosecution Office has begun 
investigations.

  [Text] Tripoli, 4 May (JANA) -- The JANA political editor 
has commented on Yasir 'Arafat and Rabin, the prime minister of 
the enemy, the terrorist, signing in Cairo today the document on 
the implementation of the so-called Gaza-Jericho Agreement. 
  He said: What should be emphasized first is that Palestine 
is 
part of the great Arab homeland which was exposed to foreign 
settler occupation, and that Zionist Israeli racism, which gave 
concrete expression to this occupation, is endeavoring to occupy 
extensive parts of the Arab homeland. This is a fact which is 
not born of inference, since these Israeli settlers have written 
it in prominent letters on the door of the so-called Israeli 
Knesset, in a phrase saying: Your land, O Israel, from the 
Euphrates to the Nile. 
  Second, awareness of this fact and of its dangers and 
dimensions inevitably leads one to say that the security and 
stability of the region cannot be guaranteed without the removal 
of this colonial settler racist entity and the establishment of 
a democratic state in the region, after the return of the 
invaders to the countries from which they came. 
  If this is not achieved, the Arab presence in its entirety 
will be threatened and the survival of all Arabs in their 
homeland from the ocean to the Gulf will be doubtful. The Arabs 
will remain in the range of Israeli nuclear bombs and weapons of 
mass destruction and exposed to destruction by these weapons. 
  The editor adds that this is a reality that cannot be hidden 
by persistent acts of deception, pressure, and obliging people 
signing worthless conventions. All this remains an illusion and 
a waste of time, and does not resolve the problem. The solution 
will never be achieved without the return of the Palestinian 
homeless to their own land, their homes, farms, and shops, the 
return of the foreigners to their countries of origin, from 
where they had come, and by removing the threat and danger from 
the Arab region, which constitute the main element of tension in 
the region. 
  If at the present stage the superpowers are making their 
potentials available to lead the Arabs to recognize 
falsification, forgery, and lies, all this will remain 
temporary. Our advice to these superpowers is to bear true 
historic responsibility in order to secure a genuine solution to 
the problem by bearing the cost of the return of the Palestinian 
refugees to their country, Palestine, and the return of the 
alien jews to their origins. Everything else is an exercise in 
lies and forgery. If the U.S. Government is serious in seeking 
a genuine peace it must bear this responsibility. 
  The editor affirms that neither this generation nor the 
coming generations of Arabs and Muslims will recognize the right 
of a settlement-based racist invasion on a single inch of their 
country, or a single grain of dust, and they will continue to 
fight until doomsday for their own right.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 5 May, (MAP) -- Abdellatif Filali, 
Moroccan minister of state for foreign affairs, has expressed 
his belief that the signing of the final agreement on the 
implementation of Palestinian self-rule signed in Cairo 
yesterday is a good start toward finding a final solution to the 
Palestinian issue. 
  However he said, in a statement to the MOROCCAN NEWS AGENCY 
before leaving Cairo, that the agreement in itself is 
insufficient and that it must be followed by other steps until a 
comprehensive peace is achieved and the rest of the occupied 
Arab territories are liberated. He added that the world is 
waiting for a comprehensive solution to all the problems of the 
Middle East. 
  Mr. Filali also said he hopes that what was agreed in Cairo 
yesterday will be implemented because the rapid implementation 
of the agreement will facilitate the resolution of the other 
outstanding problems. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Kurdish Sources Tell AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: The Chemicals Smuggled Into Iraq Came From Iran"] 
  [Text] London -- Iraqi Kurdish sources who wished to remain 
anonymous have stated that the two trucks loaded with materials 
used in the manufacture of chemical weapons seized last month by 
the police of the Kurdish Government in the northern region of 
Iraq came from Iran. 
  The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that the 
Kurdish 
drivers of the two trucks admitted that they crossed the border 
from Iran and intended to drive the two trucks to areas under 
the control of the Iraqi Government and deliver them to an Iraqi 
party known to them. 
  Officials of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], led by 
Jalal Talabani, said on Saturday that during the night 17-18 
April the Kurdish police impounded the two trucks, which were 
carrying 19 tons of sodium phosphate, which is used in the 
production of chemical weapons, and mustard gas, and that "the 
consignment was exported from the PRC and passed through a 
country neighboring Iraq." 
  The Kurdish sources said that the two trucks were seized in 
the area of Darbandikhan, which is only a few kilometers from 
the Iraqi-Iranian border. They declined to give more details 
because "the interrogation of the two drivers is not over yet." 
  Under the second Gulf war cease-fire terms, Iraq is not 
allowed to produce, import, or use chemical, biological, or 
nuclear weapons, or long-range missiles or materials used in the 
manufacture of such missiles.

explosions rocked Baghdad last on 1 May. These sources said 
that the first explosion was caused by a car-bomb near the 
Olympics Committee building on Filastin Street. After a short 
while, another explosion occurred in a nearby street. These 
sources noted that after the blasts, the regime's security 
agencies cordoned off the area and began an extensive search.

  [Text] The Kurdistan Bureau of the Supreme Assembly of the 
Islamic Revolution in Iraq stated that on 28 April the Iraqi 
opposition forces pounded the governorate building, the 
intelligence directorate headquarters, and the Ba'th Party 
building in al-Nasiriyah Governorate with mortars, killing or 
injuring dozens of Iraqi henchmen. 
  A statement released by the bureau said that the 
revolutionaries launched an assault on 27 April at an inspection 
checkpoint belonging to the al-Qurnah security directorate, 
killing or injuring 25 agents and destroying two armored 
vehicles. On the same day, the revolutionaries attacked a large 
force composed of 45 armored vehicles and a large number of 
infantry men, who were preparing to launch an offensive on [name 
indistinct] in al-Nasiriyah marshland. They inflicted casualties 
on the force and prevented it from launching the assault. 
  The statement said that the Iraqi regime formed two military 
divisions under Qusayy, the dictator's son, and Muhammad, son of 
Barzan al-Tikriti. The two divisions' task is to quell any 
possible popular uprising. 
  On the Iraqi intelligence acts of terrorism in neighboring 
countries, the statement said that the regime's intelligence 
began some time ago to train a group of agents to send them to 
Iran to carry out acts of terror there.

Kurdistan. 
  He added that French Defense Minister Leotard, British

Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana "expressed willingness to 
study that request and inform us of their position later on, and 
so did the German officials I met with previously."

<F P=106> [Report by Husni Khashabah: "Five Aims of the Iraqi-South </F>
African Military Cooperation Program"] 
  [Text] London -- Sources have revealed some aspects of the 
methods of trickery used by Iraq to obtain the best available 
military technological secrets, and the exploratory research on 
the extraction of uranium in southern Iraq. The sources, with 
whom AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT spoke in European capitals, say that Iraq 
has sent secret missions to South Africa to achieve the 
following five main objectives: 
  1. Purchase of blueprints of a new type of artillery shells 
not yet produced worldwide. They are the 210-mm giant shells. 
Dr. Gerald Paul (who was later assassinated) drew up the main 
design of the shell and the Iraqi branch of Dr. Paul's company 
coordinated with the company's branch in South Africa for that 
purpose. 
  2. Reach agreement with an arms establishment in South 
Africa to act as intermediary between Iraq and world companies 
(mainly American and British) for the procurement of extremely 
advanced equipment for checking missiles after they are filled 
with explosives. Such missiles include the Scud missiles and 
heavy artillery shells. British, American, and other companies 
were not permitted to export such sophisticated devices to a 
state like Iraq. It should be noted that the effectiveness of 
missiles and projectiles depends basically on the use of that 
kind of device. The sources said that Iraq did in fact get some 
offers through South Africa for the purchase of missile testing 
equipment. 
  3. The third aim of the Iraqi contacts with South Africa has 
been fully achieved. Baghdad has been able to purchase a 
complete factory for the manufacture of 130-155 mm artillery 
shells. 
  4. The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the fourth aim 
has been the training of technicians and engineers. The sources 
said that quite a few Iraqis have received training in South 
Africa. Travel from Iraq to Johannesburg via Frankfurt and 
London was under assumed names. According to the sources, the 
visas were issued for "the crescent state," the expression used 
in official correspondence. 
  5. The fifth aim has been exploratory research on uranium in 
South Africa [as published]. The sources said that Baghdad had 
indeed received some offers in this connection.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Transport and Communications </F>
Minister Dr. Ahmad Murtada Ahmad by Ra'd Abu-Kamil: "Continuous 
Engineering and Technical Efforts To Pinpoint and Solve 
Telephone Problems"; first five paragraphs are AL-THAWRAH 
introduction] 
  [Excerpts] There has been a great deal of talk about the 14 
Tammuz (al-Talibiyah) Switchboard, but the reality is different. 
Exaggerated issues were raised and written about regarding the 
switchboard after it was rebuilt and put into operation. True, 
there are some problems with the operation of the switchboard. 
The communication departments and officials assume 
responsibility for this. But most of the problems are 
essentially due to the difficult conditions through which our 
struggling country is passing, such as the unfair economic 
embargo imposed on Iraq, which has caused the suspension of all 
imports. Other problems are due to the subscribers themselves. 
  Still, communication department officials have not stood 
with 
their hands tied. These strugglers have accomplished brilliant 
creative feats that we highly respect. They represent new 
technological creativity in very complex fields. The engineers 
and technicians of the Communications Ministry displayed skills 
worthy of every Iraqi's pride. 
  The instructions of struggler leader President Saddam 
Husayn, 
may God preserve and protect him, on Iraqi prudence and 
creativity have had a great effect in prompting the strugglers 
of the Ministry of Transport and Communications to be creative 
regarding the switchboards and communications equipment in the 
country. They creatively cannibalized some parts and modified 
others to help restore most communication systems in the country. 
  Regarding the 14 Tammuz Switchboard, we heard many 
complaints 
after the announcement of the rehabilitation of the switchboard. 
The general complaint is that there is no dial tone in the 
phones. Others say telephones are often disrupted. 
  To learn about this and to learn the truth about the matter, 
to obtain more practical details on how the switchboard 
operates, and to learn about the measures taken by the Ministry 
of Transport and Communications and about the minister's 
personal interest in the subject, AL-THAWRAH conducted this 
interview with Dr. Ahmad Murtada Ahmad, Transport and 
Communications Minister. We also accompanied him on a field 
tour of the switchboard. 
  Dr. Ahmad Murtada Ahmad began the interview by saying: The 
previous switchboard, that is the 14 Tammuz Switchboard, was a 
crossbar type with a capacity of 20,000 lines. It was 
commissioned in 1976 and was not expandable. That switchboard, 
along with several other targets -- communication centers, 
switchboards, and microwave and coaxial stations -- came under 
enemy attack during the unfair 30-state aggression. The 
switchboard and its annexes were completely destroyed 
  The minister continued: The switchboard was rebuilt in two 
phases: first, the switchboard's building was reconstructed; 
second, an electronic switchboard was constructed in two months 
and put into operation on 23 November 1993 with a capacity of 
27,000 lines and the possibility of further expansion. This 
electronic switchboard replaced the old switchboard which, as we 
said, was totally destroyed. Intensive efforts were made by 
ministry teams, which worked day and night to reconstruct this 
switchboard. 
  I told the minister: Let us begin from this point. How was 
the switchboard reconstructed and operated? 
  [Murtada Ahmad] Engineers, technicians, and workers in all 
departments of the Ministry of Communications launched a 
struggle campaign to confront the unfair economic conditions 
facing our struggler country due to the odious blockade. They 
rolled up their sleeves and, guided by the instructions of 
struggler leader President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve and 
protect him, turned his instructions on Iraqi prudence and 
creativity into reality. They relied on repairing and modifying 
destroyed equipment and adding their own skills in this field. 
Thus the switchboard was finally installed by an unusual 
process, due to the lack of proper equipment. This situation 
resulted in some disruptions during the modification process. 
  [Abu-Kamil] So, some disruptions occurred during the 
modification process due to lack of proper equipment. Hence the 
delay in operating some of the telephone lines? 
  [Murtada Ahmad] Yes. But there are other reasons that 
delayed the operation of several other telephone lines, such as 
faulty cables and wires in the telephone network, which was out 
of use for more than three years; loss of a great deal of 
information about subscribers; transferring telephones to new 
addresses, and faults in the subscribers' own telephone 
equipment. Despite all that, some 18,750 telephones have been 
been restored to service. 
  [Abu-Kamil] You said some unusual processes were used to 
activate the switchboard, due to the circumstances of the 
blockade. What are the usual processes followed in operating 
electronic switchboards and how did you circumvent these 
processes? 
  [Murtada Ahmad] The usual processes followed in installing 
and operating electronic switchboards essentially depend on 
subjecting new equipment to quality control tests for a period 
of time to prove they are functioning well before installing 
them in switchboard centers, in order to forestall any 
subsequent problems. When we rebuilt the 14 Tammuz Switchboard, 
we did not have new equipment to use in the switchboard. We 
also did not have the equipment to carry out quality control 
tests. We had to resort to other methods, such as obtaining 
equipment and parts by repairing or modifying damaged or 
destroyed equipment. This led to the emergence of the problems 
during the actual operation of the switchboard. The ministry's 
team of engineers and technicians are making extraordinary 
efforts to pinpoint and resolve these problems. Efforts are 
being made to provide better telephone service, despite the 
circumstances of the blockade and the lack of necessary spare 
parts. [passage omitted] 
  After this interview, I accompanied the minister to the 14 
Tammuz Switchboard. It was around 2200 hours at night. The 
visit to the switchboard was not included in the program of my 
meeting with the minister. However, the minister asked me to 
accompany him in order to watch the switchboard at work. 
[passage omitted] 
  The minister ran through the daily record of complaints from 
subscribers and checked the number of telephones that were 
repaired. Then he personally called the telephone users that 
were actually repaired that day. He selected 10 telephone 
numbers at random and began calling them to make sure that the 
repair work had been done. He spoke to subscribers and asked 
about service in general. After making sure that those 
telephones had indeed been repaired and restored to service, he 
met with the employees and issued his instructions on providing 
the best service to subscribers. The minister checked the work 
of the switchboard and its employees. He was told employees had 
worked day and night for several days. 
  Our visit to the switchboard was on 9 April 1994. On that 
day, 450 complaints were recorded and 350 of them were dealt 
with by 2300 hours. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Gid'on Zelinger; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Zelinger] My first question must refer to what we 
all saw at yesterday's signing ceremony in Cairo. What did you 
feel on the stage when 'Arafat pulled his stunt? 
  [Peres] I felt embarrassment and regret, which is only 
natural. As you know, however, when something like that 
happens, you do not have time to get wrapped up in how you feel; 
all that concerns you is how to get out of it. 
  [Zelinger] You also looked angry. 
  [Peres] Justifiably so. Look, after working very hard, our 
negotiations reached a positive conclusion, we met him halfway, 
and suddenly the prime minister finds out that he did not sign 
the maps. That was contrary to everything agreed upon. 
  [Zelinger] Did you, at any stage, feel that his refusal to 
sign could make everything go up in smoke? 
  [Peres] No, I was certain things would work out, and that is 
why it angered me even more. I knew that nobody, including 
'Arafat, had any alternative. It was -- to use an 
understatement -- a very unaesthetic act before the entire world. 
  [Zelinger] Did you also consider what effect that act would 
have on support for the agreement in Israel? 
  [Peres] No, we cannot gauge the mood each and every day. In 
general, I believe that the Israeli public and others will judge 
the overall picture. I really thought that what we witnessed on 
television was the birth process: the labor pangs, the blood, 
and the baby. 
  [Zelinger] But as Yo'el Marcus asks in today's HA'ARETZ: If 
that is the birth, what sort of baby will it be? It may have 
been born with a defect. 
  [Peres] You have to look not only at the parents but also at 
the baby. The parents cannot be changed. Still, a new baby was 
born, a new situation was created, and what I think constantly 
is: Good God, why did we remain there for 27 years? For what? 
Why did we have to call up all those reservists, some of whom 
were wounded and some who even paid with their lives. A nation 
has to ask itself questions. The question is not how 'Arafat 
looks, but how we look. 
  [Zelinger] But beyond the issue of manners and conduct -- 
and I assume that all those on the stage and all those who were 
watching shared your sense of deep embarrassment -- the question 
is: What other stunts does the man who signed the agreement 
with us have up his sleeve? Tomorrow he might renege on some 
other agreement. 
  [Peres] There is also the other side of the picture. I 
think that what upset 'Arafat was that nobody from the 
territories came to the ceremony. We must look at the other 
side of the picture. He made the decision practically on his 
own, without any support. He is worried about his condition and 
his status. I believe, however, that the third and most 
important partner -- reality -- will now enter the negotiations. 
There are hundreds of thousands of people on the West Bank and 
in the Gaza Strip, including young, talented, and ambitious 
people, who did not participate in the negotiations. In fact, 
the negotiations were conducted by the Palestinian diaspora and 
not the Palestinian reality in the field. I have no doubt that 
they will make a decisive contribution which will completely 
change the character of the agreement. 
  [Zelinger] Since we are discussing reality, the ink has not 
yet dried, and the PLO is already asking for a delay in the 
implementation. Does that not indicate something about the 
capability of the organization? 
  [Peres] Yes. They are not yet a government; they are a 
movement in the diaspora. Do not forget that they do not have 
institutions like we do. On their side, everything is fragile 
and tenuous. They cannot operate in an organized way like us. 
It will take them a very long time before they become 
realistic and adapt themselves to the demands. 
  [Zelinger] That, without doubt, will be the test period 
for the implementation of the agreement.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] There is no test period. The dice 
have been tossed and the outcome is known. There is no turning 
back. We will not return to Gaza; Gaza will not return to us, 
thank God. In the name of thousands of citizens, who now feel a 
sense of relief, I say to you: Goodbye to Gaza. Anyway, why 
would we want to run their lives? Let us assume that their 
lives are not run as we would prefer. It is their lives and not 
ours; it is their way of running things, not ours. 
  [Zelinger] Their failure to run their lives will not affect 
us? 
  [Peres] They will not fail. Why should they? They will run 
things as they see fit. Do you think I am impressed by the way 
all the Arab states are run? Is that a reason for us to get 
involved? Anyway, the entire world is under tremendous pressure 
exerted by a political instrument we did not have to take into 
account before: television and radio. Developments occur as a 
result of the information flow. A communist brought down 
communism; an apartheid supporter brought down apartheid; a 
Peronist brought down Peronism. Who pressured South Africa? The 
media, the pictures, the information. I think this will also 
have an impact on the reality in the Middle East. The current 
political scene in the Middle East is a fog which hides the 
sunlight, and it will be replaced by completely new relations 
and rules. 
  [Zelinger] What would you consider a failure in the 
implementation of the agreement? What could happen that would 
indicate to you the failure of the implementation of the accord? 
  [Peres] I am not built that way. I believe in it, and I 
believe it will work out. What would pain me most is if there 
are additional casualties. There is no consolation for us or 
for them if that occurs. 
  [Zelinger] Are there any circumstances under which Israel 
would consider intervening if terrorism continues? 
  [Peres] Israel intervenes all the time. It is not that 
Israel did not try to eradicate terrorism. There is no dispute 
over that, and it will continue to do so in the future. The 
question is: Can terrorism be uprooted only through 
countermeasures -- clubs, orders, deportations -- or by also 
enlisting the other side to take positive steps that would put 
an end to people's motivation to commit suicide or attack and 
murder. 
  [Zelinger] I asked whether circumstances could crop up -- in 
the Gaza Strip, for example -- under which the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] would have to intervene with massive power. 
  [Peres] I refuse to answer that question, because if I 
answer it, I cast doubt on the trustworthiness of our measures. 
  [Zelinger] What is the next stage? Should we now deal with 
the permanent settlement with the Palestinians or negotiations 
with Syria? 
  [Peres] There are some things we have to do now with the 
Palestinians. We promised that in the wake of the present 
agreement, there would be deliberations on what is called early 
empowerment [last two words in English] for the Palestinian 
authority in the areas in Judaea and Samaria. We are referring 
to five fields, such as health, education, commerce, taxes, but 
that is still not autonomy. We promised to do that immediately, 
and we will do what we undertook. 
  Of course, I would very much like to start with Syria or 
Jordan. For the time being, Syria's moves -- if they can be 
termed moves at all -- are very measured. At the same time, we 
will continue to examine any crack or opening in order to 
continue the peace process. I would also very much like to find 
out what the situation is in Jordan, because there has also been 
an incomprehensible halt or retreat there. We are not doing 
anybody any favor and are not serving anybody else. Peace 
serves us no less than we serve it. 
  [Zelinger] The prime minister said that Syria holds the 
key to information about the fate of our POW's and MIA's. Will 
that be an inviolable condition for signing any agreement? 
  [Peres] Prior to an agreement, we exert tremendous pressure. 
If you recall, a U.S. congressional delegation went to Damascus. 
I know that Clinton and Christopher also spoke about it with 
al-Asad. We will not give an inch with regard to the fate of the 
POW's, which is at the top of our agenda when we negotiate peace. 
  [Zelinger] In the end, there are some Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad detainees among the 
Palestinian prisoners who were and are being released. Did 
Israel, therefore, yield on that? 
  [Peres] Two things are at issue: First, we did not release 
people whose hands are stained with Jewish blood. Second, the 
others have to pledge to abandon war and terrorism and to commit 
themselves to supporting the peace process. 
  [Zelinger] There are still some unresolved issues, such as 
the size of Jericho, the Palestinian policeman on the Allenby 
bridge, etc. The question is whether will Israel give in later 
in the negotiations with the Palestinians on the size of Jericho. 
  [Peres] Let us be precise. A map of Jericho was agreed 
upon. The prime minister added about 6 km, which is about 10 
percent of what we agreed to previously. What they asked for is 
to discuss it further. That is fine, but there is no commitment 
to give more. That is also the case with the policeman on the 
bridge. We responded negatively. They asked for permission to 
hold further talks. We cannot prevent that. 
  [Zelinger] The question is: Will Israel give in on those 
points? 
  [Peres] It does not have to. 
  [Zelinger] What is your opinion? 
  [Peres] In my opinion, what we signed is it, and we now have 
to move on to negotiate the early empowerment. 
  [Zelinger] To conclude, can you tell us anything concrete 
about the issue of the Jericho synagogue, which has become a 
focus of confrontation between demonstrators and the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces]? 
  [Peres] Yes, definitely. We said that al-Nabi Musa, a holy 
site for Muslims, will be under Muslim religious auspices. The 
synagogue will be under Jewish religious auspices. I think that 
in the final analysis, both sides will respect sites that are 
holy to the believers of both religions.

  [Text] Japan has pledged $200 million to the Palestinian 
autonomy, which may be extended. This was announced this 
morning by Japan's Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa after meeting 
Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni in East Jerusalem. 
Earlier, he met with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Tel Aviv. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent No'omi Segal] Japan has 
committed $200 million to the Palestinian autonomy, to be spread 
over the coming two years. Fifty million dollars have already 
been dispersed. The money was used to buy medical equipment for 
the Jericho hospital, to pay for the construction of Palestinian 
police facilities, and other development projects. The Japanese 
have also invited 70 Palestinians for training in the use of 
construction machinery. 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa announced the aid 
package after meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Tel 
Aviv. He praised Rabin on the peace process, noting that he had 
been in Cairo for the signing ceremony. 
  Afterwards, Koji Kakizawa held talks in East Jerusalem with 
Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni. Emerging from the 
meeting, the Japanese foreign minister said he hoped the aid 
package would be extended and congratulated Israel and the PLO 
on signing the autonomy accord. 
  [Kakizawa] I am very pleased to be here at this historical 
moment. There are still critical issues on both sides -- on the 
Palestinian side and the Israeli side -- but we hope that your 
goodwill and your determination to get peace will solve many, 
many difficulties, and we hope that you will go forward for 
stability and peace in this region. 
  [Segal] Kakizawa continued on to Jericho, becoming the first 
foreign dignitary to visit since the signing. He will then 
cross into Jordan via the Allenby bridge and later visit Syria.

  [Text] Two soldiers were injured in stone-throwing 
incidents in the territories yesterday. Near Nabulus, a soldier 
suffered medium injuries when a military vehicle in which he was 
traveling came under a hail of stones. He was taken to 
Beilinson Hospital for treatment. The village of Hawwarah, 
where the incident took place, is under curfew. 
  In Jericho, a soldier suffered light injuries when local 
residents threw stones and bottles at the police station at the 
center of town. 
  During the night, dozens of right-wing activists and 
settlers 
continued their efforts to try to reach the ancient Jewish 
synagogue in Jericho. Part of the town has been declared a 
closed military area. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says soldiers 
were busy chasing those trying to infiltrate. Several arrests 
were made.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "End of a Round; Beginning of a Phase"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday's signing of the agreement to implement 
the first stage of the Palestinian transitional self rule 
constitutes the end of a long round of hard negotiations, 
conducted over seven months in more than one capital and 
interspersed with bloody, tragic events. This fact increases 
the importance of the agreement and raises the stakes on it. 
  When the implementation of this agreement starts today, the 
Middle East crisis is expected to enter a new and important 
turning point, which will in the end lead to the achievement of 
a just and comprehensive peace and the Palestinian people's 
regaining their legitimate national rights, including their 
right to full independence and the building of their state on 
the soil of their homeland, Palestine. 
  The achievement of that aspired-for goal hinges on two basic 
conditions. First, Israel must remain committed to it pledges. 
It must also remain sincere in its peace intentions, especially 
when moving to the next phase in the self-rule plan. Second, 
the Palestinian national authority must know how to use this 
opportunity to prove that the Palestinians are worthy of their 
right to freedom and independence. 
  At any rate, and regardless of the importance of the step 
that is expected to start today -- and it is an important step 
indeed -- the desired peace in this part of the world will 
remain incomplete and under threat unless it is completed on the 
other fronts of the conflict and unless a parallel progress is 
made on all the Arab-Israeli tracks, that is, until the 
achievement of the objectives on the basis of which the Madrid 
agreement was convened 30 months ago. 
  We hope the agreement to implement self rule is the start of 
a new phase in the march of the Palestinian people toward the 
achievement of their legitimate goals and a step that will be 
followed by other steps on the path of achieving an Israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories . We also 
urge the peace process cosponsors to take advantage of the 
momentum generated by this agreement to work on achieving 
parallel progress on all tracks of negotiations and a just and 
comprehensive peace that can be accepted and protected by future 
generations.

<F P=106> ["Headlines" column by Fahd al-Fanik: "Israeli-Palestinian </F>
Customs Union"] 
  [Text] The economic agreement between Israel and the PLO 
signed in Paris on 29 April falls short of the minimum 
requirements of the economic cooperation accord between Jordan 
and the PLO. The PLO-Israeli agreement amounts to a unilateral 
abrogation of the one concluded between Jordan and the PLO. 
  We may have to await the publication of the full texts and 
annexes of the Paris agreement, which are said to be lengthy and 
detailed. The salient points as reported by AFP, however, are 
sufficient to understand the drift of the agreement. 
  For some reason or other, the Jordanian Government wants to 
assess the agreement in a different light. It may be that it 
does not want to strain relations with the PLO or the sponsors 
of the agreement. Or it may be that the Jordanian Government 
does not want to disrupt the peace process or interfere in the 
Palestinian decisionmaking process, even if it is at the expense 
of Jordanian interests. 
  The Jordanian-Palestinian economic cooperation agreement 
signed in Amman on 7 January 1994 provides for the Jordanian 
dinar to be in circulation in the West Bank and Gaza, along with 
other Arab and foreign currencies. The Paris agreement 
expressly states the shekel will be legal tender, among other 
currencies. 
  The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement grants Jordan's Central 
Bank the right to oversee the banking and monetary systems in 
the West Bank and Gaza during the transition period. The 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement sanctions the institution of a 
local monetary agency to fulfill that role. However, the 
proposed Palestinian monetary agency will be controlled by the 
Israeli monetary agency. 
  The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement envisages increased 
trade 
between Jordan and Palestine. Under the Paris agreement, there 
will be a joint customs authority on the West Bank's border with 
Jordan and Gaza's border with Egypt, meaning a customs union 
administered by Israel and incorporating the West Bank and Gaza. 
As a consequence, the Palestinian market will continue to be 
captive to Israeli products, and the Palestinian consumers and 
investors will continue to be exploited by Israel as they are 
now under occupation. The only difference will be that, instead 
of the exploitation taking place under the coercion of 
occupation, it will now take place with the blessing of the 
Palestinian side. 
  As for some Jordanian products being allowed onto the 
Palestinian market, this will be conditional on prior Israeli 
approval. Furthermore, only a limited number, with a maximum of 
$15 million worth, of unimportant Jordanian goods that Israel 
does not produce will be allowed in annually. 
  In a nutshell, the Paris economic agreement sacrifices 
Jordanian and Palestinian interests and confirms the West Bank 
and Gaza as adjuncts to the Israeli economy, thus detaching the 
Palestinian economy from the Jordanian economy. It is a 
unilaterally submissive agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by AL-BILAD's political editor] </F>
  [Excerpts] The conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian 
economic agreement and Jordan's announcement that it has adopted 
new measures regulating the residence of West Bankers in Jordan 
have been among the most prominent events reviving the 
undeclared state of war between the PLO and Jordan. 
  Well-informed sources say that Jordan is disturbed by the 
economic agreement that the PLO signed with Israel because it 
contains many points that have overlooked the Jordanian role and 
the economic agreements that should be signed with it while PLO 
leaders view Jordan's measures on the residency of West Bankers 
in Jordan as a step to pull the carpet out from under the PLO's 
feet and a new Jordanian attempt to confirm its authority over 
the Palestinians. 
  A ranking Jordanian official believes that mending the 
Jordanian- Palestinian relationship has become somewhat 
difficult following the PLO-Israeli economic agreement, which 
conflicts to some extent with the contents of the agreement on 
economic understanding between Jordan and the PLO. [passage 
omitted] 
  A Palestinian official who declined to be named says that 
the 
Palestinians major concern during the formulation of the 
economic agreement with Israel had been how to wrest some gains 
that will enable them to build the nucleus of an independent 
Palestinian economy that would depend on neither the Israelis or 
the Jordanians. 
  The official told Al-BILAD that Israel has agreed to the 
Palestinians right to directly import from Arab and world 
markets. 
  The Palestinian official reveals that on his arrival in the 
occupied territories, President 'Arafat will immediately start 
building a floating port in Gaza to enable him to import 
commodities needed by the autonomous region until the Gaza Port 
is completed in two years. 
  The PLO's move toward direct import greatly worries Jordan. 
If it materializes, Jordan will not be the lungs through which 
the occupied territories will breathe and will not be the place 
through which all commodities will pass. Thus, Jordan will be 
deprived of the unique economic relationship which binds it to 
the West Bank and on which Jordan had wagered much to achieve 
economic recovery. 
  While Jordan has such fears, the PLO also has similar 
apprehensions, particularly with respect to the recent measures 
on easing restrictions imposed on the West Bankers. 
  Palestinian officials believe that with its surprise 
measures 
Jordan wants to enhance its relations with Palestinians in the 
occupied territories and reinvigorate them within a legal 
framework in a manner that will give it historical tutelage over 
them. 
  However, Jordanian Interior Minister Salamah Hammad had 
emphasized that the recent Jordanian measures and the facilities 
that were given to the West Bankers have no political 
connotations. 
  Political observers believe that the recent Jordanian 
measures would lead to a Palestinian exodus from the territories 
toward Jordan. Some expect that approximatley 200,000 people 
will leave. 
  Observers also believe that this exodus will be accompanied 
by a transfer of captial from the West Bank to Jordan while the 
prevailing belief had been that Palestinian capital would move 
from Jordan to the West Bank. 
  These observers believe that the rivalry between Jordan and 
the PLO to win the hearts of Palestinians will exacerbate, 
particularly since Jordan enjoys a good reputation among some 
Palestinian leaders. 
  Palestinian sources told AL-BILAD that President 'Arafat 
might adopt several measures to tighten his control on the 
population and to put the Palestinian house in order, such as 
the closing of the borders with Jordan for a period that could 
last three months. 
  In any case, the coming days will reveal the dimensions of 
the dispute and the war between the PLO and Jordan.

<F P=106> ["Special to THE STAR" by Ben Wedeman] </F>
  [Text] Palestinian and Israeli negotiators took six months 
to negotiate the economic agreement signed in Paris last Friday 
[29 April], but it took only a few minutes for observers in 
Amman to shoot holes in the accord. The official text of the 
agreement has been closely guarded, but what has been made 
public is arousing profound concerns about the agreement's 
impact on the Jordanian and Palestinian economies. 
  Jordan has reacted cautiously to the agreement. Jordanian 
officials insist there is no contradiction between the 
PLO-Israel economic agreement and the economic accord between 
Jordan and the PLO signed in January. Nonetheless, Jordan has 
requested "clarifications" on certain points in the PLO-Israeli 
agreement and a senior PLO negotiator is expected to meet 
Jordanian officials in Amman to discuss the agreement. 
  Opinion of independent observers and analysts, however, is 
generally against the PLO-Israel economic accord, "This 
agreement is very bad as far as Jordan is concerned," a 
political analyst told THE STAR. The analyst, who requested 
anonymity, noted that the "number one issue" for Jordan is the 
future of the Jordanian dinar in the West Bank and Gaza. He 
warned that the PLO-Israel economic agreement will undermine the 
use of the dinar, leading to a fall in the dinar's value and a 
sharp depletion of Jordan's hard currency reserves. He also 
warned that this will further exacerbate Jordan's debt burden. 
At the same time, he warned, new investment opportunities in 
the West Bank and Gaza will attract Palestinian capital at 
Jordan's expense. The short term prospects for the Jordanian 
economy, he concluded, are not encouraging. 
  As'ad 'Abd al-Rahman, director of the Shuman Foundation and 
a 
self-described "PLO man," expressed hope that the dinar would 
continue to be the currency of choice in the Occupied 
Territories, "I hope that the [Palestinian] entity's orientation 
will be westward, not eastward," he said. 
  Commenting on the agreement, economist Fahd al-Fanik said 
the 
agreement "proves once again that the current negotiations are 
not between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but rather 
between the Israelis and themselves. It was Israel which wrote 
the text [of the agreement], and the Palestinian delegation 
succeeded at introducing a few simple reservations and limited 
exceptions." 
  The agreement, according to al-Fanik, "serves Israel's 
interests and sacrifices the joint interests of the Jordanians 
and the Palestinians." It places economic barriers between 
Palestinians and Jordan, and "prevents them from exchanging 
goods and services except via Israeli customs" on the bridges 
linking the West Bank and Jordan. 
  Critics of the PLO-Israel economic agreement worry the 
accord 
has done nothing but win PLO approval for Israeli economic 
control of the Occupied Territories, at the expense of future 
Palestinian economic relations with the Arab world in general 
and Jordan in particular. 
  "The economic agreement in its entirety puts Israel's 
economic interests in the forefront," Taysir Khalid of the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) told THE 
STAR. Khalid, who resigned from the PLO Executive committee in 
protest over the Gaza-Jericho accords, said the economic 
agreement "subordinates everything to Israeli interests and to 
the protection of the Israeli market. 
  Khalid believes the agreement legalizes Israeli exploitation 
of the Occupied Territories, and thus represents no significant 
change in itself. "What is new is that the Israeli policy of 
annexation and integration has been legalized with Palestinian 
approval," said Khalid. The Palestinian negotiators in Paris, 
"rather than defending the need to break the two economies apart 
and to enable the Palestinian economy to develop independently, 
have accepted Israel's conditions and dictates." 
  Not all reaction has been negative. While acknowledging the 
negative impact the agreement will have on Jordan, one analyst 
told THE STAR Palestinians in the West Bank will benefit from 
integration into the Israeli economy. "The investment climate 
in the West Bank, which was near zero, will improve 
dramatically," he said. He predicted a surge of investment from 
Palestinians living abroad, and didn't discount the possibility 
of Israeli investment in the area taking advantage of lower 
production costs. The more than one billion dollars earmarked 
by the World Bank for the Palestinian autonomous authority will 
also help create a positive investment climate. 
  According to banking expert Yusuf 'Abd al-Haq, the agreement 
represents the first step in the implementation of the report 
published by Harvard University earlier this year, entitled 
"Security Peace in the Middle East; Project on Economic 
Transition". "This is a clear implementation of the Harvard 
Unviersity report, which calls for the establishment of open 
Palestinian-Israeli economic relations, followed by the 
establishment of relations between the Palestine-Israel market 
and Jordan, and finally by their integration into Arab markets."

  [Text] Amman--When the government-owned Telecommunications 
Corporation (TCC) last week accepted bids for a licence to 
install and operate a multi-million dollar cellular telephone 
network in the Kingdom, it implicitly broke the Arab boycott of 
Israel. 
  The TCC accepted the bid from a Jordanian firm in 
partnership 
with an American company included on the Arab League's boycott 
list--Motorola. 
  Motorola, which operates Israel's cellular network and 
maintains manufacturing facilities there, bid in partnership 
with the Jordan Mobile Telephone Services Company. 
  The tender for the project, which is expected to be 
operational in one year, was open to only Jordanian companies, 
as stipulated by a new law passed by Parliament last year that 
allowed local private- sector participation in the provision of 
telecommunication services. 
  The tender, however, requires local firms to be associated 
with foreign companies with proven experience in the field. The 
qualification and expertise of the foreign operators in running 
the Global System for Mobiles (GSM) network will be one of the 
main considerations of the TCC while granting the project. (The 
local company must enter into a contract with the foreign 
operator to manage the venture). 
  "Officially we are only dealing with Jordanian companies, 
Motorola is not on the table," said Minister of 
Telecommunications Tariq Suhaymat. "To be fair, we have to look 
at all the companies and their bids and go through a long 
evaluation process, there may be other companies on the boycott 
list," said the minister, who stressed that it was "premature" 
to discuss the issue since the evaluation process had not 
reached that stage. 
  Foreign companies participating in the eight bids, which 
were 
unsealed last Tuesday, also included Cable and Wireless of 
Britain, Telecom Finland, SFR of France and Millicom, Vega and 
Nynex of the United States. 
  Motorola, whose local partners include the Housing Bank, the 
Arab Banking Corporation (ABC) the Union Bank for Investments 
and Mid investment, came first in the bids. 
  The group's offer was JD 38 million, almost twice that of 
the 
second highest bidder. But an extensive evaluation process is 
carried out before a contract is finally awarded. 
  "Motorola may not be awarded the project, but the fact that 
it was allowed to bid means Jordan ignored the Arab boycott at 
least for this project," said a competitor. "Motorola's high 
offer may be an attempt to whet the appetite of the government 
to overlook the boycott." 
  Companies must pay a licence fee of JD 7 million to the TCC, 
plus compensation for scrapping the existing mobile telephone 
system and a minimum 20 per cent annual royalty to the 
state-owned corporation. 
  Mr. Suhaymat said: "We have to be very careful and look out 
for the national interest. We want the best for the country and 
we want this project. It is a political decision, and a 
complicated issue." 
  A Department of Customs clearance is required for all 
companies that do business in Jordan, including, among other 
things, a check on whether it is on the boycott list. Motorola 
appears in the blacklist of the department. 
  Local private companies dealing with firms on the blacklist 
are in violation of the Arab League boycott regulations. 
  In a pre-bid conference with prospective investors, the TCC 
made it clear, according to one of the participants, the foreign 
operators involved in the bids should not be on the boycott list. 
  Jordan insists on maintaining the 43-year-old boycott until 
a 
just, lasting and comprehensive peace is achieved. Jordan's 
official position was again reaffirmed at a March 26 Arab League 
meeting which ignored American and European pressure to ease the 
boycott. 
  Since the Arab League imposed the boycott, any lifting of 
the 
embargo should also come through a resolution from the league. 
  His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hassan has said that lifting 
the boycott of Israel "prematurely" would be "tantamount to 
economic suicide" for Jordan. 
  The GSM project is one of the country's largest ventures, 
and 
the second to allow the private sector to enter the 
telecommunications sector after a radio paging concession 
granted four years ago. The GSM is seen as essential for Jordan 
in competing with other countries in the region, especially now 
that a peace settlement is expected to open borders between the 
Arab World and Israel. 
  Motorola, a leading supplier of cellular equipment, recently 
won a $32 million contract for a 30,000-subscriber GSM system in 
Kuwait, which relaxed restrictions on blacklisted firms after 
the Gulf war. 
  U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, in a visit to the region 
in January, said fresh American investment in Jordan depended on 
removal of trade barriers and the lifting of the secondary 
boycott that primarily affects U.S. companies. Motorola, one of 
the largest American companies, was mentioned in this context, 
according to Amman-based diplomats. 
  The U.S. Senate earlier this year passed legislation barring 
U.S. military sales to countries that try to persuade American 
firms to comply with the Arab boycott against Israel. 
  The legislation aims at the so-called secondary and tertiary 
boycott against U.S. firms doing business with Israel. It is 
illegal for American firms to observe the boycott by providing 
related documents required by the governments of the importing 
countries. 
  The Arab boycott covers three areas in commercial 
activity--the primary boycott bars the 22 members of the Arab 
League from direct commercial activity with Israel. Egypt has 
been exempted since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. 
  The secondary boycott, which includes about 10,000 firms, 
blacklists companies which have a branch, factory or investment 
in Israel. Firms are regularly put on or struck off the list by 
the Damascus-based Arab Boycott of Israel Office. 
  The tertiary boycott targets companies which do business 
with 
blacklisted firms in order to avoid being blacklisted themselves. 
  Officials and diplomats said in private after Mr. Brown's 
visit that Jordan, coming under U.S. pressure, was adopting 
case-by-case approach to the secondary and tertiary boycott.

  [Excerpt] Amman (J.T.)--The French government has decided 
to stop its participation in the multi-national inspection force 
which is inspecting al-'Aqabah-bound ships to monitor the 
implementation of the international embargo imposed on Iraq, 
Agence France Presse (AFP) Wednesday [4 May] quoted a French 
foreign ministry spokesman as saying. 
  The spokesman announced that the decision became active 
immediately following requests by Jordan to replace naval 
inspections in with an onshore process. 
  France, said the spokesman, was the only country which 
participated continuously in the naval inspection operation 
alongside the U.S. since they were launched. 
  The spokesman was quoted by AFP as saying that the decision 
to quit the force was taken in close coordination with the U.S. 
and His Majesty King Husayn and U.N. Secretaary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali were informed of it. 
  Informed sources told the London-based AL-HAYAT newspaper 
that Canada turned down a U.S. request to replace French naval 
forces in monitoring the embargo in the Red Sea. 
  AL-HAYAT quoted the sources, who were not identified, as 
saying that the Canadian government totally rejected replacing 
the French forces. 
  The sources commended the French decision saying it 
"reflects 
France's understanding of the Jordanian stand and manifests its 
desire to narrow the gaps and reconcile international legitimacy 
as a slogan and international justice in reality." 
  Jordan, which has announced the suspension of its 
participation in the Middle East peace process until the siege 
on the port of al- 'Aqabah was lifted, has reached an agreement 
with the U.S. providing for land-based sanctions verifications 
by a neutral side. 
  The French embassy in Amman late Wednesday issued a 
statement 
announcing its decision to quit the multinational inspection 
forces, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, said. 
  Through taking this decision, it said, "France aims to 
demonstrate its support for Jordan in finding a formula that 
would help reduce the heavy burdens inflicted upon the Jordanian 
economy by the naval inspection operations." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [`Text' of interview with King Husayn by unidentified </F>
AL-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Paris, 4 May (PETRA)--His Majesty King Husayn 
has reiterated Jordan's commitment to the peace process. 
[passage omitted] 
  Interviewed by the Paris-based magazine AL-SIYASAH 
AL-DUWALIYAH, his majesty said that, God willing, Jordan and 
Jordanians shall keep their heads held high and will never bow, 
except to God. [passage omitted] 
  Following is the text of the interview: 
  [AL-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH] The launching of the Arab-Israeli 
peace process two years ago has stirred hopes and fears. How do 
you assess these hopes and fears? 
  [Husayn] There will inevitably be great hopes to end this 
tragedy in a way to give all concerned parties, particularly the 
Palestinian side their rights on their national soil, and 
consequently to give all sides the chance for a new way of life 
permeated by stability and tranquility. However, there are 
fears that the hardheads on both sides will continue to try to 
abort the possibilities of reaching a solution which satisfies 
all parties, and which is acceptable to the coming generations 
so they can live under its canopy and build on it. 
  Regarding the fears, they are real ones and are represented 
by the lack of coordination, regardless of signs of coordination 
from time to time on the Arab level, given the state of 
inter-Arab affairs we are experiencing in the Greater Arab 
Homeland, which lessens our chances of attaining the desired 
settlement. 
  For example, in the last period, following the bloody Hebron 
massacre, it became clear that the Israeli authorities should 
assume their responsibilities now and in the future. All sides 
will be able to see this in the future. Israel has failed to 
fulfill its duties, and must, as an occupying power, be held 
responsible for a string of events, including the burning of the 
al-Aqsa Mosque, the transgressions on the Christian holy places, 
and the aggression, more than once, against the Hebron Mosque, 
ending with the most recent tragedy. This poses the following 
question: Has Israel fulfilled its duties to protect and 
safeguard these holy places on the road to reaching a solution 
that satisfies all parties? In our opinion, there cannot be a 
solution without tackling the religious mandate which safeguards 
the rights of the followers of the three divine religions. 
Sovereignty over the holy places should only be to God. 
  As a result of the lack of coordination during the 24 or 36 
hours preceding the issuance of the UN Security Council 
resolution on the Hebron massacre, and as a result of the 
dialogue among the Palestinian, U.S., and other sides, to which 
we were not a party, we were not surprised that the resolution 
was issued the way it was. I tried to do the impossible in the 
last moments. I tried to hold contacts to achieve something and 
to focus on the request not to veto the resolution or to 
abstain, particularly by the United States. If this has to 
happen, and it has actually happened, then there must be a way 
by which we obtain an assurance that the United States' policy 
on Jerusalem will not change, as it changed in the past. In the 
beginning, the United States considered settlements illegal then 
these settlements turned into an obstacle to peace, and now we 
have reached the current situation. 
  Perhaps, the way this draft resolution or the tragic 
incident 
were dealt with include some mistakes. In other words, had we 
been able to avoid mentioning Jerusalem and instead refer to the 
Geneva Convention on the protection of citizens under occupation 
in order to protect the Palestinians in all the territories 
which were occupied in 1967, we would have found ourselves in a 
better situation than the one we experienced as a result of the 
resolution and the U.S. abstention; something which could be 
interpreted as a change in the U.S. position on Arab demands in 
Jerusalem. 
  The only explanation for all this is that it is a result of 
the lack of coordination at critical, sensitive points and under 
difficult circumstances. Calling for coordination is apparently 
meant to provide a kind of cover for progress by this or that 
Arab side whenever they feel like it. 
  However, the chief demand for all of us is to have full 
coordination. So far, we have not been able to achieve this. 
Naturally, this is not encouraging because Israel is one side 
while we are several. We have not been able to crystallize a 
position which reflects the Arab position and its seriousness 
about reaching a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace 
acceptable to future generations. 
  On the other hand, there are great hopes that the world will 
pay more attention to the need to act regarding the issues we 
face in order to come up with acceptable solutions that are 
convincing to the peoples in this region to enable them to 
obtain what is their right. We hope that the performance will 
improve in the future to enhance the chances to reach the 
aspired solutions. 
  [AL-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH] What are the prospects for the 
establishment of a Palestinian state? How do you view this 
state? How do you evaluate the position of the Palestinians 
inside and outside [the occupied territories] on the future of 
the region? 
  [Husayn] I am always hesitant to speak frankly about these 
issues, fearing what I say might be misconstrued. However, I 
believe the Palestinian brothers have a chance which they should 
not miss, regardless of what they are going to achieve. We hope 
that the first steps regarding the Oslo accord will constitute 
the beginning and that efforts will continue to implement 
Security Council Resolution 242 and achieve Palestinian demands 
on Palestinian national soil. I feel that what the brothers 
have experienced over the past 26 years and their continuing 
suffering makes it impossible to imagine that a Palestinian 
entity would be established unless it is based on democracy and 
respect for human rights and unless the Palestinian people 
exercise their right to take part in shaping their future, away 
from any methods the Arabs have got used to in this part of the 
world and at this time in the greater homeland. This is the 
only road that can yield good results for the Palestinians. 
Consequently, they should contribute to promoting a new 
pattern, which we here in Jordan insist on proposing to the Arab 
brothers in our greater homeland, through the exercise of 
democracy and respecting the human rights and worth of the Arab 
individual, provided this individual contributes positively to 
the shaping of his own future. 
  [Al-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH] Does the peace process endanger 
Jordan, particularly if autonomy leads to a state of instability 
in the occupied territories which are at the doors of the 
Kingdom? 
  [Husayn] I hope no such thing will take place. We hope that 
the situation in the occupied territories will stabilize when 
these territories are liberated and that the march will proceed 
to liberate this land and grant the Palestinians their rights on 
it. 
  As for us here in Jordan, our course is to safeguard the 
unity of the one big family to which we belong from all origins 
and to have our march proceed on the basis of the national 
charter, the Constitution, democracy, shura, and the respect for 
human rights until the circumstances of any member of this 
family enables him to opt for another course if he finds the 
road open to him to exercise this right. Until that time, we 
will remain more than ever cohesive in the face of all 
eventualities. It is no secret that we are constantly subjected 
to momentous pressure because we believe in democracy, in shura, 
and in man and his right to participate in mapping out his 
future. Some may view this as a threat to them while we view 
it as the only course to achieve stability and build the Arab 
force on the pan-Arab level. 
  On the other hand, threats are being made against this 
country to subdue it. However, with God's help, this country 
and its sons will not be subdued and will only bow their heads 
to God. In my opinion, we are to prepare ourselves for more 
pressure. We must endure these pressures because what is in the 
balance is more important than everything else, more important 
than us, and more important than this stage through which we 
pass. This is because our responsibility is toward the future, 
honor, the cause, and toward justice. No party has succeeded in 
imposing on us something in which we do not believe. We are 
committed to the peace process and we want peace, but a peace 
that can last and under whose canopy all will enjoy a new state 
of affairs that will be different from what we have experienced 
over the protracted past. 
  [Al-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH] Jordanian public opinion has not 
been sufficiently taken into consideration as you repeatedly 
stated. In your opinion, how will the Jordanians approach peace? 
  [Husayn] We have a public opinion and it should be consulted 
and taken into consideration. However, frankly speaking, I 
believe that we should work more to inform the people about all 
the facts so that they can form an opinion. We should stop 
tackling our causes in a pessimistic manner or with the 
mentality of the fifties. We should be realistic and 
responsible and at the same time act through the confidence we 
all have in the soundness of our march and the knowledge we are 
proceeding in the right direction, taking into account all the 
realities we and this region are experiencing. 
  [AL-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH) How do you view the impact of 
peace on regional economy, particularly the Jordanian economy, 
following the signing of an economic agreement between the PLO 
and Jordan and the signing of other agreements by the PLO, 
Israel, and Egypt? 
  [Husayn] As for the economic dimension, there is much talk 
on 
the issue of Arab boycott of Israel, for example. We, however, 
are trying to explain the issue to the world, and we also demand 
that there be a balance in dealing with that dimension. The 
question is not one of an Arab boycott of Israel. I believe 
that the current situation of foreign companies and industries 
with interests in the region is now different from the previous 
one. Israel is actually exercising a boycott. Israel is a 
state that protects its products and exercises a boycott against 
the Palestinians, the Arabs, and Jordan in particular. All 
these issues should be treated in an appropriate manner to clear 
the way for future dealings. 
  On the other hand, if peace is achieved, it will give the 
world and us in particular every chance to deal with many 
persisting issues and will improve the quality of life. There 
are other persisting issues, foremost of which is water, for 
example. We want to know what our share of water is. All 
resources may not be sufficient for all the parties involved; 
namely, Palestine, Jordan, and Israel. This issue should be 
dealt with quickly. 
  Expectations are that water resources available to us in 
Jordan will not be sufficient in the future; even for household 
uses within the next few years. So, alternative resources 
should be sought. 
  We have to move toward peace in light of the contents of the 
agenda of bilateral negotiations with Israel--an agenda which 
was signed by us and the other side and which includes the issue 
of the occupied Jordanian territories--and without encroaching 
on the Palestinian rights pertaining to what used to be our 
responsibilities, until the Palestinian side assumes its 
responsibilities. When these territories return to Jordan's 
sovereignty, we can discuss what can be done regarding the 
Jordan valley beginning from the north, as well as the water 
issue, in order to find answers to the questions on our rights, 
the other Arab sides' rights, and the Israeli dimension in this 
issue. 
  [AL-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH] Would you please brief us on 
Jordan's principled position on peace in light of Amman's 
refusal to sign a peace agreement with Israel before all the 
outstanding issues are solved. Does Jordan mean bilateral 
issues alone or all the Arab issues? 
  [Husayn] All these matters should be dealt with. We have 
been facing an Arab position. In other words, Jordan was asked 
to sign a peace treaty and then discuss all these details. This 
is strange talk. This proposed method applies only to the state 
of surrender not to the state of making a lasting peace. 
Therefore, we insist on dealing with all these different issues 
on the different sides so that peace can crown satisfactory 
solutions to all these issues. Peace cannot be achieved unless 
we deal with all issues. I believe that progress is being made 
on the other tracks. In the final analysis, the goal is a 
comprehensive solution, which is required to change the image 
into the new situation, that is, peace in the region. 
  [AL-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH] How do you view progress on the 
Syrian and Lebanese tracks, especially after the al-Asad-Clinton 
meeting and Syria's acceptance, in principle, of signing a peace 
treaty with Israel? 
  [Husayn] We are now focusing on bilateral issues. However, 
we are well aware that the same method of operation is being 
used on the other tracks. There are issues that affect all of 
us, such as the question of water. There is also an important 
dimension of peace that must entail a change in the pattern of 
people's behavior and the opportunities available to them. This 
change should mean a new beginning in contrast with what the 
case has been so far. All of this requires discussion and 
study. We cannot tell the world: Go ahead and change the 
situation of man in this part of the world before we address all 
these issues. Once we do that, we can ask the world to step in 
and contribute to shaping the future in light of the desired 
peace. 
  I believe that the al-Asad-Clinton meeting was useful and 
very important. There is mutual confidence. This is what I 
have sensed from President Clinton when I met him and also from 
the Syrian president as a result of the frank discussion the two 
presidents had at that meeting. The dialogue is continuing, and 
this is undoubtedly encouraging and gives us hope that things 
will proceed in the right direction. 
  The U.S. President and his administration are coming under 
pressure. There is also an ongoing battle in the U.S. arena by 
certain parties which are trying to bring about positions in 
favor of Israel at this critical stage when we are witnessing 
serious attempts to achieve a just and lasting peace in this 
region. What is upsetting about all of this is that the Arab 
position is fragmented, unpleasing, and unsatisfactory. 
  We asked a question at the outset. Was it necessary to 
involve the question of Jerusalem in Resolution 904 on the 
Hebron massacre, since it was possible to see a U.S. veto or 
abstention? Does this signal a change in the U.S. position? In 
our contacts, we have asked the United States to tell us that 
its position does not signal a change. However, time will tell 
whether or not this is the case. If this is the case, then may 
be there is a flaw in the way we have been collectively 
addressing the question on the Arab level so far. This portends 
losses at present and negative effects on Arab interests in 
general in the future. 
  [AL-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH] The Yemeni accord document which 
was signed in Jordan proved that inter-Arab problems can be 
solved by the Arabs themselves which is contrary to the 
situation during the Gulf crisis. Does this attempt contain 
hopes toward improving inter-Arab relations in a more 
comprehensive way? 
  [Husayn] It seems that we were blamed when we said we hoped 
that this would be the beginning of solving inter-Arab problems. 
On the internal Arab level and within the one family, we may 
not have reached the desired solution yet. However, I feel that 
what has been achieved is a great accomplishment because all 
representatives of the Yemeni people were in Amman when the 
document was signed. 
  Therefore, we hope that the Arab public will play its role 
in 
maintaining the accord and achieving its objectives. 
  Unfortunately, we found that directly after the signing of 
the document, the situation in Yemen was on the verge of a big 
explosion. We, along with our brothers in the Sultanate of 
Oman, made a move. I believe that the efforts by the joint 
military team resulted in removing the specter of bloody 
clashes. All the evidence shows that these clashes could have 
taken a tragic form. 
  Now, what is required of our brothers in Yemen is to prevent 
the reccurence of such a critical situation, on one hand, and to 
maintain their unity and continue formulating the new Yemen as 
they all want this. 
  In my view, it was always possible to handle inter-Arab 
problems on the Arab level and within the framework of one 
family, stemming from a concern over the nation's interest. Are 
we at the threshold of a new era? I certainly hope so. I will 
always seek to achieve this with the best of our abilities. 
However, this requires an equal response and sense of 
responsibility by all and the realization that this is in the 
interest of the nation at present and in the future. This is 
above all other considerations. 
  I cannot say that I am optimistic, but I can say that this 
is 
what the Arab human being wants and that his will should impose 
itself on this awkward situation the continuation of which is 
totally unjustified. 
  [AL-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH] How do you assess the influence of 
extremist currents in the region, especially those who reject 
the peace process in the name of Islam? 
  [Husayn] Extremism does not always reflect a feeling of 
depression and pain. In my opinion, it could come as a result 
of the people's continuous suffering and could reflect a loss of 
confidence in responsible leaderships. In other cases, 
extremism could reflect an ambition to assume power. For 
instance, so far we have been ignoring a very serious issue. It 
is the issue of Afghanistan. At one stage, we, in the Arab and 
Islamic world, reached a concensus to support our brothers and 
kinsfolk in Afghanistan in order to remove foreign influence and 
presence, as well as attempts to cancel the identity of 
Afghanistan. However, the events currently taking place cannot 
be satisfactorily explained by anyone in terms of the continuing 
conflict, infighting, sabotage and the suffering of the Afghan 
people. 
  In fact, this is the worst justification for the 
continuation of such conflicts and massacres of which we hear, 
but which we have not thus far been able to tackle decisively. 
We feel that we have a religious responsibility to defend our 
religion and tolerance in the face of any attempts to distort 
them, which might come as a result of ignorance, frustration, or 
despair on the part of the Arab and Islamic side. At the same 
time, this might take place as a result of other sides' attempts 
to misunderstand us and, consequently, to offend us, and maybe, 
to find a new enemy in this world after the collapse of 
Communism in the former USSR. We beseech Almighty God to save 
the Arab and Islamic world from dangers, whether coming from 
outside, or those posed by acting in the name of Islam when 
Islam has nothing to do with this. 
  [AL-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH] Jordan was a target of acts of 
terrorism from inside and outside. One of the Jordanian 
diplomats was also killed. Why does Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna] 
seek to escalate his war against Jordan, and what is Libya's 
role in this? 
  [Husayn] This is not the first time Jordan has been exposed 
to such criminal attempts and operations, and lost a diplomat of 
its righteous sons. This organization, which is known as the 
Abu-Nidal organization, had played a role in such crimes. We 
cannot jump to conclusions. Investigations are being conducted 
and measures have been adopted in the Lebanese arena concerning 
this incident in particular. We are grateful to Lebanon and 
Syria for the efforts they have thus far exerted to uncover the 
circumstances surrounding this crime. 
  In fact I cannot understand how what happened, this time or 
in the past, could be interpreted as serving the Arab interests 
in one way or another. Concerning this issue, when we have 
known all the details, we will contact the Arab brothers who 
might host this man or his headquarters and discuss the issue 
with them to see what their answer will be concerning the 
continuation of such operations, which, I am very certain, have 
more than once, served the enemies at the expense of Arab 
interests and reputations. 
  [AL-SIYASAH AL-DUWALIYAH] Given the fact that you have been 
in power for 41 years, how do you view the Arab nation's future, 
and do you still believe in Arab solidarity and Arab unity and 
in the possibility of attaining them? 
  [Husayn] I still believe in them and my faith in Arab 
solidarity has not wavered. But, at the same time, I feel 
bitter because I cannot reply to this question in a categorical 
manner. While I have hopes, I still want to be realistic. As 
yet, and in these critical and difficult circumstances I cannot 
say that we have something which we can derscribe as unity, Arab 
solidarity, cooperation, or coordination even at the minimum 
level of what is required when viewed against the backdrop of 
the broader picture. However, contacts with some of our brothers 
and cooperation with them using all our means and capabilities 
are under way. We constantly used to emphasize the need to act 
but in a completely different manner. 
  In the past, I spoke much about the European experiment and 
what it has achieved. I have always wished that we in the Arab 
homeland, being one nation, would achieve some of what they had 
reached. But, when we make a comparison, we find that we are 
still behind what the Europeans have achieved in spite of the 
wars and bloody disputes that have raged among them this 
century. The time has come for a real Arab resurgence in the 
Arab homeland, and we ask God to guide us in this direction. 
  With the opportunities I still have to serve and build and 
with the future that awaits this country, I will do the 
impossible to safeguard Jordan's stability, to maintain Jordan 
as a brilliant flame in the great homeland, and to have it fully 
pursue its role and duties. This country deserves the best and 
we will do the impossible so that the pillars will be strong, 
the bases firm, and the future promising, God willing.

  [Text] Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sadqi flew to Amman 
this evening to attend meetings of the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian 
Committee on cooperation. He was greeted by Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. 
  The Egyptian prime minister said he hoped the committee 
meetings would strengthen cooperation between the two countries. 
  [Begin Sidqi recording] We hope by renewing the meetings, 
this joint committee, the Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee, 
would strengthen the relations between our two countries for the

people. [end recording] 
  "News at Ten" asked Prime Minister al-Majali about his 
impressions following today's signing of the PLO-Israeli 
agreement in Cairo. 
  [Begin al-Majali recording] I am a very optimistic man, all 
my life, so I am not going to change this time, and I think I am 
still optimistic and I always look forward to the 
implementation. And what I felt today, there is a real spirit 
of having honest implementation. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The Hittin Mosque in Irbid last Saturday [30 
April] was the scene of a clash between members of the Society 
of Repudiation and Renunciation and the Muslim Brotherhood. 
Chains, sharp instruments, bricks, and sticks were all used as 
weapons. The brawl took place against the backdrop of 
differences that have built up over the past year and a half. 
The Society of Repudiation and Renunciation activists sought to 
settle a score with the Brotherhood members after the evening 
prayers at the mosque. 
  Eyewitnesses of the melee, which began inside the mosque and 
then continued outside, said a member of the Society of 
Repudiation and Renunciation set upon a member of the 
Brotherhood as he performed the evening prayers. The latter 
carried on with his prayers, but once they were completed, a 
verbal clash developed and degenerated into a scuffle between 
the two. Members from the two sides were then drawn into the 
battle, with the Society of Redemption and Renunciation men 
employing knives, daggers, and sticks. [passage omitted] 
  By all accounts, it was the Redemption group that triggered 
the fight and heightened the tension. Witnesses add that their 
hostile behavior was premeditated. There was widespread 
resentment of the way the Society of Redemption and Renunciation 
adherents sought to rectify the morals of the camp residents 
whom they accuse of being infidels for their failure to abide by 
the precepts of the Koran. [passage omitted] 
  A pious, enlightened young man traced the disagreements 
between the two sides back a year and a half, to when the 
Repudiation and Renunciation Society formed in Irbid. The 
group's members, he said, think the Brotherhood's ideas are 
moderate and their attitude toward people is too soft. They 
want the Brotherhood to adopt a sterner attitude toward the 
government and society. Its adherents have more than once 
vilified the mufti of Irbid and a number of the city's shaykhs. 
  The young man maintained that the group was modelled on the 
faction of the same name that originated in Egypt. They tend to 
view most people as blasphemous, contending that they do not act 
by the rules laid down in the Koran. A Muslim who does not 
abide fully by the Sunnah is, in their eyes, a blasphemer. They 
routinely hassle revelers at wedding parties, sometimes 
disrupting such functions. They are also said to be opposed to 
people wearing wrist watches, and necklaces, as well as trousers 
and various other articles of clothing. 
  Meanwhile, security sources speaking to AL-BILAD attributed 
the mosque brawl to personal reasons. Witnesses, however, 
report that differences center on rival interpretations of 
prayers from the perspective of the Koran and Sunnism. The 
Redemption and Renunciation Society is said by other sources to 
be scaring children off religious lessons given by Hamas, the 
Islamic Resistance Movement. Police have apprehended an entire 
family suspected of membership in Hamas. 
  Abu-'Adnan, the man who does the calls to prayers for the 
Hittin Mosque, told AL-BILAD he witnessed the scuffle at close 
range. It began as verbal abuse before it developed into a 
clash in which chains, knives and daggers were used. The 
attack, he maintains, was several days in the making because the 
chains had been in the mosque before the scuffle happened. 
  Colonel 'Abdallah 'Ulaymat, the Irbid Police Commissioner, 
dismissed ideological differences as the cause of the violence, 
blaming personal differences instead. 'Ulaymat noted that during 
questioning, the suspects disclaimed affiliation to any Islamic 
group. The matter is so minor it does not merit a mention in 
the press, Col. 'Ulaymat asserted.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report: "Fresh Arrests Among Jordanian Afghans"] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Jordanian security authorities are continuing 
their campaign of arrests against the ranks of the Jordanian 
Afghans. The campaign is starting to face strong resistance by 
some of the elements of these groups, who are using firearms. 
This unprecedented phenomenon signals an increase in the 
violence of these groups. 
  We have learned that the latest arrests have been 
concentrated in al-Rusayfah and al-Zarqa' towns and the 'Awjan 
area for the past two weeks. Officers and men, assisted by 
personnel from the special police force, carried out arrests and 
apprehended a great number of people from these groups, which 
are believed to have a connection with attempts to plague Jordan 
with terrorism. 
  According to a knowledgeable source, the campaign did not 
end 
peacefully. One of the suspects fired at a security officer, 
wounding him in the leg. 
  The latest arrests are apparently part of a series of 
measures to fight the establishment of terrorist organizations 
in the Kingdom financed from abroad. Jordan is taking rather 
harsh measures to contain the terrorist groups that have been 
formed recently. 
  AL-BILAD has recently noted a number of attempts on the 
world 
level, instigated by Israel, as well as other attempts sponsored 
by Arab businessmen, to brand Jordan with terrorism and 
implicate Amman in a never ending cycle of terror. 
  We begin in Denmark where big question marks are raised in 
connection with a fire at a residence of a Jordanian citizen who 
was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and currently resides in 
Denmark. According to well-informed sources, the Danish police 
arrested three Egyptians following the fire and investigated the 
possibility that the suspects are connected to the bombing of 
the World Trade Center [WTC]. Two of the arrested men were 
political refugees and the third holds Danish citizenship as 
well as Egyptian citizenship and currently resides in Denmark. 
  The three were accused of buying chemicals used to 
manufacture explosives similar to those used in the WTC bombing. 
The name of the Jordanian citizens, whose house was set on 
fire, has not been released. The Danish authorities' arrest of 
the three Egyptians is construed as having a link with the fire. 
However, the incident created the impression, encouraged by the 
United States and Israel, that certain Jordanian nationals are 
involved in terrorism. 
  It goes without saying that for U.S. public opinion, the 
most 
sensitive act of terrorism is the bombing of the WTC in February 
of last year. According to Arab sources, active Israeli 
security bodies in Europe are now trying to invent false 
connections between Jordanians residing in Europe and Egyptians 
suspected of belonging to the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah led by 
Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, currently detained in the United 
States. 
  Therefore, Jordan must prepare to confront a media war that 
is expected to be launched against it from Washington and 
European capitals on terrorism stories similar to the one we 
just related. 
  This war is not isolated from fears by certain Arab sources 
that the [Israeli intelligence service] Mosad is perhaps 
carrying out assassination attempts against Hamas members in 
Jordan. The aim is to create confusion in Jordan and disturb 
the security of the country and create a new climate of 
terrorist acts. 
  In short, Israel is endeavoring to drown Jordan in the 
maelstrom of terrorism and extremism in two ways: the first is 
by giving international public opinion the impression that the 
Jordanians have some sort of connection with acts of terrorism 
in Europe and the United States; and second, by threatening to 
carry out terrorist acts in Jordan itself and disturb the stable 
security conditions in the country. 
  Meanwhile, secret attempts by Arabs have also been revealed 
aimed at drowning Jordan in acts of terrorism by financing 
groups returning from Afghanistan. 
  As has already been mentioned, the first Arab involved in 
financing terror in Jordan was the Saudi businessman Usamah Bin- 
Ladin. Jordanian security investigations have already revealed 
that one of the leaders of the Jordanian Afghans, Zakariya 
Muhammad Dawud, traveled to Sanaa and met with Yemeni figures 
representing the financier, Bin-Ladin, who helped him join 
training camps. 
  Bin-Ladin finances large training camps of Arab Afghans, 
including quite a large number of Jordanians, in Sanaa with the 
aim of exporting terror to Jordan. 
  Jordan is exerting immense efforts to apprehend a Saudi 
merchant and arms smuggler by the name of Nasir Mashhur 
al-Ruwayli. Al-Ruwayli is considered one of the most dangerous 
drug traffickers and gun smugglers across Arab borders. He uses 
drug smuggling in striking arms deals and smuggling these arms 
to Arab states. 
  It is feared that this smuggler was involved in supplying 
weapons to extremist groups to carry out terrorist acts. 
Members of these groups in Jordan were arrested recently. 
  According to Arab sources, this smuggler is now charged with 
smuggling drugs and arms in many Arab states including Yemen, 
Algeria, and Egypt. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Commenting on the limited self-rule agreement that 
was signed between the Palestinians and Israelis in Cairo today, 
Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz said: We do not believe this 
agreement fulfills all the ambitions we had for the Palestinian 
people. This agreement does not spell out clearly the future of 
these negotiations nor is it committed to recognizing a 
Palestinian state, political rights, or the human rights of the 
refugees. He added: proceeding from this premise, we are not 
among those who are enthusiastic about or applaud this 
agreement. But since the PLO broke away from Arab solidarity 
and coordination, which was in its own interests, and since all 
we wanted from this coordination was to stress our moral 
obligation to the Palestinian cause, all we can do is to wish 
the PLO success, despite this agreement's being shamefaced 
[khajulan] in terms of its results.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Information Minister Michel </F>
Samahah by unidentified reporter on 4 May, following "the 
signing of the Israeli-PLO agreement"; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Samahah] Having seen what has taken place in Cairo 
this morning, I would like to say that in spite of attempts to 
embellish things, we have witnessed an agreement of concession 
and the relinquishment of the Palestinian people's rights and 
Palestinian land. The cause has been put aside. At the signing 
ceremony this morning, Mr. 'Arafat gave up even the title the 
Arabs have granted to the president of the state of Palestine. 
I believe Israel continues to follow an arrogant and sly path. 
This sustains the hatred that cannot coexist with peace and 
under whose canopy peace cannot flourish. Peace can only 
survive in an atmosphere of justice, and the recovery of rights. 
Rights cannot be regained while Jerusalem remains besieged by 
an agreement and while the Palestinian people have not even 
regained their basic rights. I believe this is more of an 
arrangement between dealers than an agreement between two 
countries, or between a country and a people whose rights are 
being regained. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Your Excellency Minister 
Samahah, this is on the national level, on the Palestinian 
level. Why this apprehension by the Lebanese authorities, by 
the Lebanese Government toward this agreement? 
  [Samahah] Because I view this agreement as being the final 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. After it was signed today, it is no 
longer Gaza-Jericho First. Thus, rights have been squandered, 
and an unjust basis for peace has been established. We fear for 
the peace process following this signing and believe the peace 
course is full of mines. 
  [Correspondent] On the Lebanese level, what impact will this 
agreement have on the Lebanese arena, that is, with respect to 
the issue of resettlement, and the issue of the presence of the 
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon? 
  [Samahah] If the Israeli leaders or Mr. 'Arafat believe that 
through such an agreement they will legalize resettlement, they 
will be ignoring the Palestinian people's rights, which we did 
not give up and which we want to maintain unharmed. We want to 
maintain these rights completely, in terms of the right to 
repatriation, the restoration of rights and land, and the right 
to citizenship on Palestinian land. Second, in the preamble of 
our Constituttion, we have reiterated our rejection of 
resettlement. The Lebanese are unanimous on this principle. 
The rejection of resettlement is not motivated by a 
regionalist, or chauvinist approach, but by our concern about 
Palestinian rights in Palestine and about our rights as Lebanese 
on our land and concerning our sovereignty. 
  [Correspondent] Minister Samahah, do you believe the 
conclusion of this agreement will complicate the other tracks, 
the tracks between Lebanon and Israel, and between Syria and 
Israel, or will it facilitate these tracks? 
  [Samahah] This agreement has given us an example of the kind 
of agreements by which Israel seeks to convert the countries 
around it into suburbs. We reject this. Therefore, we reject 
this unfair agreement. On the basis of what was agreed this 
morning, the agreement cannot be a comprehensive one. I believe 
the negotiations will be more complicated than some tend to 
believe. The future will tell. 
  [Correspondent] Your Excellency Michel Samahah, thank you 
for 
this interview.

<F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah on 4 May, </F>
followed by question-and-answer session with unidentified 
correspondents; place not given --recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Samahah] The cabinet reviewed its agenda and 
approved several items, including a draft bill amending taxes on 
domestic consumption of fuel to be referred to the Chamber of 
Deputies. [passage omitted] 
  The cabinet also discussed and approved the Public Works 
Ministry's road works program for the year 1994-1995. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] This issue was discussed. The conference will be 
held in June, and the level of participation will be decided in 
another session. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] This information was broadcast over television and 
radio stations today. As for its impact on Lebanon, no matter 
what has been signed, we are always concerned that any agreement 
signed abroad should not have a negative effect on Lebanon. If 
you mean the Palestinians' settlement in Lebanon, as far as we 
are concerned, the Palestinian representatives are free to sign 
whatever they want; but we do not believe that this agreement 
has restored the Palestinians' legitimate rights to their land. 
Lebanon rejects the settlement for two basic reasons: First, 
we believe in the Palestinian people's right to return to their 
land and determine their future on their own soil. Second, we 
have the same concern for Lebanon's identity as an Arab country 
affiliated with its Arab homeland. As concerned as we are about 
the Palestinian identity in Palestine, we are also concerned 
about the Lebanese identity in Lebanon and this is [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] Let us wait and see what happens with the 
agreement. We are only concerned with our track. As the 
president said, we are concerned about the negotiations because 
we entered the negotiation process in Madrid as Arabs. The 
Lebanese, Syrian, and Jordanian tracks are still on the same 
level of progress. 
  If the Palestinians opt out, this means that they have 
departed from the Arab fold. They have left the Arab fold and 
Arab unity for unilateral negotiations and the signing of an 
agreement. 
  With regard to the negotiations, we are still committed to 
peace, but to a just peace based on the recovery of rights, to a 
comprehensive, just, and durable peace in line with the 
principles according to which Lebanon, along with Syria, Jordan, 
and the Palestinians, entered the negotiations in Madrid. 
  [Correspondent] Christopher [words indistinct]. 
  [Samahah] To start with, his tour is not over yet. He is 
still in Cairo. [Words indistinct] that he will return in 15 
days. Let us wait and see. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] Who is [word indistinct]? Secretary Christopher or 
Lebanon? 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] Not only is Lebanon taking a stand. Lebanon has 
adopted a position based on its conviction that it went to 
Madrid based on certain principles and wants to pursue the 
negotiations through these principles. I do not believe we 
should interpret Lebanon's absence from Christopher's itinerary 
in this context. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At their monthly meeting today, the Maronite bishops 
stated that the continuing detentions and investigations since 
the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church have done nothing to 
reassure the public. They said that the focus is shifting from 
the Sayyidat al-Najat Church file to other files, that this 
crime has been removed from official attention, and that it has 
been used as a means for political rather than criminal trial. 
  The Maronite bishops denounced what they called the pursuit 
of many youths, which may harm Lebanon's reputation. They 
stressed that media freedom is the basis of freedoms. They 
noted that the issuing of the prospective media law will be a 
healthy sign if it guarantees freedom of expression. They 
called on officials to show serious attention to the people's 
economic difficulties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Awn Expresses Willingness To Hold </F>
Direct Dialogue With Syria"] 
  [Text] Paris, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Former Lebanese Prime 
Minister General Michel 'Awn yesterday expressed willingness to 
hold a direct dialogue with Syria with no Lebanese intermediary 
but on condition that "Damascus state its position clearly and 
in advance on a number of basic points which are not negotiable." 
  'Awn, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from his 
residence 
in La Hutte Maison in the outskirts of Paris, said: "I hope 
that what I am saying will not be interpreted as appeasement." 
  'Awn added: "I do not agree to talk to the Lebanese regime. 
I prefer to talk to the party directly responsible on the 
ground. That party should, before the dialogue starts, make a 
number of commitments on two main issues, namely sovereignty and 
independence." 
  'Awn believes that "a practical demonstration of these two 
issues can be made by scheduling withdrawal of the Syrian Army 
from all Lebanese territory." 
  He described the claims made every now and then about 
attempts to open a dialogue with him as mere maneuvers. He 
added that "serious dialogue cannot be done through the press." 
'Awn asked: "What has become of the investigation into the 
crime of blowing up Sayyidat al-Najah church?" 
  He said that that case should be urgently dealt with because 
"it is a special case, independent of any other case." He said 
that "that incident was fabricated and opened the way to other 
crimes."

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "An Agreement That Bestows 
Legitimacy on Occupation," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Yasir 
'Arafat signed a new agreement with Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday as 
an extension of the Oslo agreement that was secretly negotiated 
outside the Washington peace talks and without the participation 
of most Palestinian leaders in and outside of the PLO. We do 
not know how many subsequent agreements will be signed and 
presented to the people. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Anyone who saw the huge notebooks signed by 
'Arafat and compared their size to their miserable contents will 
say: What revolution until victory has 'Arafat led toward a 
besieged Gaza Strip and a small detention camp, which is at 
Israel's disposal and which is called Jericho? Anyone who 
contemplates the role played by 'Arafat when he refrained from 
signing, and then signed with head held low and without the 
usual signal of victory, will be overwhelmed with regret and 
sorrow. 
  The paper says that in view of these negative indicators, 
any 
agreement not supported by the people will lose its value, its 
seriousness, and its strength, and ultimately face a known fate. 
What has happened between the PLO and the Israeli Government is 
not in the interest of the Palestinian people. Practical 
experience shows this agreement will not push the peace process 
toward its objectives, represented by establishing peace, 
regaining rights, and safeguarding the interests of all parties. 
  AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria seeks a just and comprehensive 
peace. Syria has never accepted, and will not accept, separate 
and incomplete solutions. The paper points out that we, in 
Syria, have cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, for the 
sake of such peace. It emphasizes that a just and comprehensive 
solution will achieve a durable peace, saying that any agreement 
that is not accepted by peoples, that does not secure peoples' 
national interests, and that is not in line with the resolutions 
of international legitimacy cannot bear the seeds of its own 
life. This is because the will of peoples will triumph at the 
end. 
  Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: The Palestinian people, who are 
known for their struggle and sacrifices, will continue to 
express themselves and achieve their objectives regardless of 
dark days and hard circumstances. 
  Under the headline "The General Mourning," the newspaper 
TISHRIN says: It is very clear that the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
and its signature are not a step on the path of peace. This 
agreement places new obstacles before the peace process, and 
removes from Israel a heavy burden as a result of the escalating 
and continuing intifadah. This was explained by the fact that 
many Israeli officials acknowledged that this agreement secured 
a partner for Israel and its security, and that a security 
alliance was established between the PLO and Israel to confront 
and end the intifadah. 
  TISHRIN explains: By showing firm, broad, and angry 
rejection of the self-rule agreement, the Palestinian people are 
reiterating their insistence on toppling this agreement and are 
showing that they will never relinquish their objectives for 
which the tumultuous intifadah was unleashed in order to totally 
remove the occupation from the occupied Palestinian territories. 
  The paper emphasizes that the Palestinian people are aware 
that any partial solutions, phased settlements, and separated 
deals can only be in favor of both Israel and its occupation and 
will not be in favor of Palestinian national rights. 
Concluding, TISHRIN says: All facts point out that the anger 
that prevailed in the occupied Arab territories when 'Arafat 
signed the liquidation of the Palestine question was the 
strongest proof that Israel has dragged the Palestinian side 
into a situation with grave consequences and into further 
concessions. These concessions began in Oslo, then continued, 
and recently ended in a fragile agreement not in the interest of 
the peace process. This agreement gives Israel many gains, and 
turns the Palestinian police into tools to guard both the 
occupation and the settlements.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The ball is now in the Israeli court 
following U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's talks in 
Damascus with President Hafiz al-Asad. Christopher has said his 
talks reached a serious, substantive level, and that he has 
conveyed ideas from Damascus. 
  The Israeli foreign minister has acknowledged that the 
questions conveyed by Christopher were serious and complicated. 
President Hafiz al-Asad had briefed the U.S. secretary on 
Syria's view, which stems from a true desire to achieve a just 
and comprehensive peace that guarantees the rights of all 
parties. President al-Asad stressed that addressing the basic 
issues in the peace process would ensure progress. 
  There is no doubt that full Israeli withdrawal from the 
Golan 
and the occupied territories is a major issue. Without 
acknowledging the principle of complete and speedy withdrawal, 
it is impossible to realize progress. The question of the Golan 
is not only that it is Syrian territory occupied by force; there 
are also tens of thousands of displaced Syrians who were forced 
to flee from their land and are now awaiting return. There is 
also the question of the towns destroyed by Israel, especially 
the city of al-Qunaytirah that was turned to rubble and is now 
awaiting reconstruction. It is unreasonable to reconstruct this 
heroic city of martyrs while Israeli threats are still a reality. 
  The occupation has left behind deep, bleeding wounds that 
must be dressed. This is impossible without a speedy Israeli 
withdrawal. Syria has for some time now been offering full peace 
for full withdrawal. If we are to deal with Israel through 
citing the statements of its officials, then peace, as Rabin 
himself has acknowledged, is the best guarantee of security. 
  Syria is offering honorable, true, firm, and lasting peace; 
Israel, on the other hand, will only be withdrawing from Syrian 
territory that was occupied by force and responding to the 
resolutions of international legitimacy by putting the record 
straight and putting an end to many years of illegitimate 
practices on the Golan. 
  Syria can only understand Israel's reluctance to accept full 
and comprehensive withdrawal as a way to evade the obligations 
of the peace process. 
  If we revisit the past, we will find that the leaders of 
Israel have been shouting loudly, since 1948, calling for peace 
with the Arabs and appealing to the world to intervene to hold 
Arab-Israeli peace talks. Yet, as soon as the United States 
announced a peace initiative in the Middle East, through former 
President George Bush, the Israeli officials started creating 
impediments and obstacles to it. Thus, they unwillingly 
participated in the Madrid conference and wasted two years of 
the Washington talks. Instead of the comprehensive peace 
proposed by the Arabs, they have propagated piecemeal peace over 
long stages in order to prolong the occupation and suffering -- 
despite the fact that a piecemeal peace is not a solution, nor 
does it lead to a solution. Rather, it nurtures tension in the 
region. 
  The Israeli officials are today facing a new test. They have 
been crying out for some time now that they are concerned about 
a lasting peace with Syria. Secretary Christopher has taken 
along with him from Damascus ideas that will lead to a lasting 
peace if Israel responds to these ideas and truly responds to 
the UN resolutions and the foundations of the Madrid conference. 
  The Israeli officials are well aware that Syria will not 
engage in phased settlements and partial solutions and that it 
looks forward to regaining its occupied territory, and 
consequently, to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces. The 
Israeli officials are also well aware that Syria keeps its word 
and that it makes peace honorably and fights war honorably. 
However, peace is impossible to build as long as occupation and 
threats continue. There is no alternative to fully removing 
occupation, establishing justice, and removing all 
manifestations of threat and expansion in the region.

<F P=106> [Article by Shibdas Bandhopadhyay] </F>
  [Text] The assurance Narasimha Rao gave at the very 
beginning that he would make efforts to democratize the 
structure and function of the party has suffered a setback at 
the very inception. Though the strength of the prime minister 
in the government has increased, his position as party leader is 
gradually weakening. Recently, the prime minister himself 
violated his earlier pledge regarding maintaining a democratic 
structure in the party by dismissing the state committees of the 
party in 10 states with the stroke of a pen and installing 
selected people who are obedient to him in those states. 
  Personal interests rather than political consideration 
always 
played a greater role both in making and in violating pledges. 
The main allegation against the Nehru-Gandhi family was that 
they did not care to abide by democratic norms while running the 
affairs of the party. They were competent in administering the 
party on an ad hoc basis. There has been no organizational 
elections of the party for at least 20 years. After Rao was 
nominated party leader and prime minister, he announced that if 
the party adopts the path of democratization through the holding 
of organizational elections then it would become difficult for 
the followers of Sonia [wife of late Rajiv Gandhi] to get the 
leadership of the party. With the passage of time, Rao has 
himself surrendered to the ruling family. It is significant to 
note that Rao held about an hour long face-to-face talks with 
Sonia before appointing the ad hoc committees of the Congress-I 
in 10 states. Party men have noticed that Sonia is gradually 
getting rid of her lack of interest in politics which she 
earlier displayed. The recent visit of Sonia to Andhra Pradesh, 
which is the constituency of Rao, her acceptance of an 
invitation extended by the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, 
Digvijay Singh, to visit the state, and her later rejection of 
an invitation -- are all are quite significant. 
  Under Rao, elections to the working committee of the 
Congress-I and also the organizations of the party throughout 
the country were held. Earlier the members of the working 
committee were nominated. Taking advantage of the elections, the 
groups opposed to Rao became active and became desperate to 
seize the control of the organization. After the election of 
the working committee, Rao identified the persons who posed a 
challenge to his authority. He then made influential leaders 
like Arjun Singh [Human Resources Development Minister] and 
Sharad Pawar [Maharashtra Chief Minister] resign from the 
working committee and inducted people nominated by him in their 
places. Apart from these minor strategies, Rao allowed the 
party to move in its own way. Then he became active to 
consolidate the seat of the prime minister by keeping his 
authority on his party firm. He also succeeded in establishing 
an absolute majority of his party in the Lok Sabha by creating 
divisions in different parties and winning them over to his 
party despite the existence of the Antidefection Law. 
  After consolidating the seat of the prime minister and 
making 
it free from danger, Rao has now turned his attention toward the 
party organizations. He wants to make these organizations such 
that they will only carry out his orders. Rao is sparing no 
opportunity to embarrass and harass Arjun Singh and Sharad 
Pawar. This has been proved by the incidents that took place at 
a function held to pay homage to martyrs of the Jalianwalabag 
massacre [this massacre took place during the British rule]. At 
this function, the human resources development minister, Arjun 
Singh, was harassed, and Sharad Pawar was embarrassed over the 
issue of the illegal wealth of Dawood Ibrahim [underworld 
figure]. 
  It appears from the last meeting of the working committee 
that the authority of Rao has been reestablished. The State 
Congress committees of Goa and Gujarat have entrusted Rao with 
the responsibility of nominating their leaders. This confidence 
in and allegiance to Rao may lead to autocracy. The failure of 
Rao to nominate the chief minister of Gujarat even in two months 
has created doubts whether he deserves the confidence that has 
been placed in him. In the last working committee meeting, at 
least five pro-democracy leaders viz. Arjun Singh, Balram Jakhar 
[agriculture minister], A.K. Anthony [civil supplies minister], 
Rajesh Pilot [state minister for home], and R.K. Dhawan raised 
objections to giving supreme power to Rao for reconstituting the 
working committee and the All India Congress Committee. At the 
end a compromise was reached that allowed Rao to reconstitute 
the party committees in the states and the organizations at the 
lower level. By exercising this power, Rao can keep the 
provincial leaders within his grip. 
  The organizational success of Rao will depend on his 
efforts to suppress the powerful groups within the party. Apart 
from this, he needs to win over the people by his own charisma 
and also have a dependable group of followers. Until now Rao 
has failed to achieve any of these two objectives. This state 
of affairs has created a favorable situation for his sycophants 
like Pranab Mukherjee [commerce minister], Sidhartha Shankar Ray 
[Indian ambassador to U.S.] and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. Pranab 
Mukherjee is now showing as if the West Bengal State Congress 
Committee is within his pocket. At the same time he is studying 
the prospects of the reentry of Sidhartha Shankar Ray in the 
politics of the state. He is also keeping a watch whether Priyo 
Ranjan Das Munshi makes any sabotage. Priyo Ranjan is keen to 
get either the position of Soumen Mitra [leader of the West 
Bengal State Congress] or a post in the union cabinet. He is 
not willing to delay this special day celebration. 
  Due to the pace at which Rao is proceeding, the confused and 
divided opposition cannot rule out the possibility of sudden 
elections in at least 10 states if not of the Lok Sabha. These 
states include Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Goa, Manipur, 
Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Orissa, and Arunachal Pradesh. Rao 
has not taken up any political program or announced any slogan 
as a preparatory measure for the holding of elections in these 
states. 
  The scope of preelection slogan talk has reduced in view of 
the current economic and political scenario at the national and 
international level. The days of cheap slogans and announcement 
of schemes are over. For these reasons, Rao has become more 
interested to use party organizations as a tool to win 
elections. With this end in view the process has started to 
nominate the right candidate, remove the dissidents, and to 
convert the party into a professional bureaucratic organization. 
Rajiv Gandhi also adopted the same techniques in the year 1989. 
Will Rao ultimately be able to control the impact of the GATT? 
  Rao is now trying to run the party in the style set up by 
Indira and Rajiv. Until now he has failed to attain the command 
displayed by Indira or Rajiv. He has postponed for an 
indefinite period the organizational elections that were 
scheduled for this year. This time all appointments against 
party positions will be given on an ad hoc basis. Rao will 
perform this task with the assistance of different committees or 
observer groups. He will brief these committees or observers 
about the people liked and disliked by him. 
  In the past this strategy or method failed to mobilize the 
internal strength of the Congress. Will it be different in the 
case of Rao? Or will he gradually hand over over his authority 
to No.10 Janapath [residence of Sonia Gandhi]? Rao has achieved 
some election successes in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. 
In these two states, Digvijay Singh and Vir Bhadra Singh have 
become chief ministers by defeating the leaders who had the 
blessings of Rao. In these two states the party organization 
has been resusticated to the grass-roots level. Party elections 
in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan has been set aside. In 
these areas, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, perhaps, Rao wants 
to nip in the bud the prospects of the growth of powerful 
leadership. The reverses suffered by his party in the elections 
held in these states has been seen by all. Here lies the danger 
of running the party on an ad hoc basis. The claims he can make 
regarding the successes of the government will perhaps not play 
a significant role in the contest during the elections. In that 
case his dream to lead the party during the next Lok Sabha 
elections may be shattered whether the elections is held on 
schedule in 1996 or earlier.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "More Arm-Twisting?"] </F>
  [Text] It is easy, and tempting if one happens to be a 
critic of the Congress, to attribute almost all actions of the 
Narasimha Raa government to US arm-twisting. Even the Prime 
Minister's acceptance of May 19 as the date of his meeting with 
President Clinton is being interpreted as a meek nod to the 
Americans' dictates. The government has only itself to blame if 
this impression gains ground in the context of the two-day 
meeting between Indian and US representatives at London. 
Despite the loud denials by the Minister of State for External 
Affairs, Mr R. L. Bhatia, two things are clear. The London 
meeting was a suggestion from the US carrying the force of an 
unrejectable proposal and the agenda of the meeting did pertain 
to the US insistence on India accepting a multilateral process 
for disarmament and regional security in South Asia. The May 19 
summit is quite obviously designed to announce India's 
concurrence with the launching of the multi-lateral process, 
also known as the 5 + 2 + 2 Conference, without Mr Narasimha Rao 
giving the appearance of having been forced into it by deviating 
from India's declared nuclear policy of the past two decades. 
The camouflaging and sugarcoating may have been worked out in 
London where the Indian and American teams are giving shape and 
structure to the concept. India has refused to consider earlier 
proposals for regional security and de-nuclearisation of South 
Asia and has so far not accepted the 5 + 2 + 2--five permanent 
members of the UN Security Council, Germany and Japan and India 
and Pakistan--on the ground that nuclear disarmament is not a 
regional issue but a global problem. 
  To be fair to the Government, Mr Narasimha Rao has so far 
yielded less ground on the nuclear policy front than on the 
economic front. In both, the options for India are not too many. 
Yet again, accepting to meet in a third country to chalk out a 
bilateral summit agenda defies logic, whatever the logistical 
advantages the authorities may have conjured up. India can duck 
the issues but cannot dare defy the superpower initiative. As 
far as domestic political fall out is concerned, Mr Narasimha 
Rao's negotiating skills are to be sharpened to successfully 
duck the issues. It can be done in two ways. First, India can 
ask for an enlarged conference on the problems of global arms 
control and rope in Russia, North Korea, Iran and a lot else 
into the proposed multi- lateral process. There is no dearth of 
Indian expertise and knowledge for this line of action. The 
second option, possibly less objectionable to the opposition at 
home, is to avoid any kind of specific commitments -- there are 
any number of technical details to be sorted out -- on the NPT 
and regional security proposals. The second option is not only 
available but also exercisable.

of the Central Bank of Iran, by unidentified correspondent; date

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] ['Adeli] [passage omitted] 
The setting up of non-banking establishments will truly change 
the state monetary system. The government approved the policy 
today. I should explain that according to that policy from now 
on our private sector will also be able to set up non-banking 
credit establishments. 
  As you know, at the moment in our country only banks deal 
with money matters. [passage omitted] In a developing country, 
which needs more investments; more savings, there is a need for 
more instruments to attract people's savings. That is why in 
many developing and developed countries non-banking 
establishments exist. We also decided to create such non-banking 
establishments in order to offer, on the one hand, a more 
diverse variety for people's investments and, on the other hand, 
to be able to offer loans. The only difference between those 
institutions and banks is that they cannot issue written credit 
documents. That is they cannot offer check books to the public. 
They can offer all types of saving accounts and offer all type 
of loans, but they cannot offer any current accounts. In our 
announcement next week we shall set out all their conditions so 
that those seeking to set up such establishments can apply 
accordingly. God willing, such establishments will begin 
operation in our country and a better efficiency is brought 
about in the country in the allocation of resources. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, Dr. 'Adeli, for your 
explanations.

  [Text] At a Cabinet session today, a recent decision by the 
committee for regulating the foreign currency market was raised, 
which relates to the supply of foreign currency to those 
importers who have registered or will be registering at the 
Ministry of Commerce for imports in lieu of their exports. It 
was decided that the banking system will follow the policy 
diligently and that the companies and establishments owned by 
the government or affiliated to it will avoid participation in 
the foreign currency market. 
  Taking into consideration the readiness of the banking 
system 
to supply the foreign currency requirements of this group of 
importers, the presence of state companies and those companies 
affiliated to the government in the foreign currency market will 
be deemed treason and offenders will be prosecuted. 
  According to a decision by the Cabinet, any negligence by 
executive banks in carrying out the new decisions by the foreign 
currency regulating committee will be deemed as collaboration 
with saboteurs of the state currency and economic system.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Hoseyni Khamene'i, leader of the </F>
Islamic revolution, to lecturers, teachers, and workers at Imam 
Khomeyni's prayer house marking the week honoring teachers and 
workers on 4 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate the 
merciful. [passage omitted] I would like to take the 
opportunity today to talk about the fact that there are two 
points of view in our country and in many so-called Third World 
countries. 
  One view is that the people, the enlightened, and the 
decision-makers of the country must rely on a world-dominant 
power to build their country and make a future for their 
country. [passage omitted] That is one view. It exists in 
backward countries. Those who have studied geopolitics know 
that it exists in Latin America and in some Asian and African 
countries. Some enlightened people and politicians believe 
this. [passage omitted] 
  I very much regret to say that there are, unfortunately, 
some 
people in some parts of our country today who still have the 
same view. They are still under the influence of the remnants 
of ideas and tastes of past puppets of the West and the United 
States. That is one view. 
  Another view says no to this: We are a nation; we have 
certain capabilities; we must adopt the principle of utilizing 
our own capabilities. Of course, if we are ever stuck and see 
that someone else has better tools, we will go and borrow his 
tools and do our job. Then we will try to manufacture those 
tools ourselves. That is a sensible thing to do. [passage 
omitted] To a nation, that means scientific, practical, 
technical, cultural, and all-round independence. From the 
beginning the revolution has pursued this form of independence. 
  Some other countries have followed this path. Countries 
which were nearly razed to the ground after World War II -- as 
is usually exaggerated in reports -- have risen and taken care 
of themselves and used their own manpower. By managing their 
worldly affairs they have today surpassed those who brought such 
misery to them in the war. It can be done. That is the other 
view. 
  The aim of our imam [Khomeyni] -- God be satisfied with him 
-- was to say to our nation: O people of Iran, O Iranian youths, 
O Iranian workers, O Iranian engineers, O Iranian managers, you 
can do it without relying on foreigners. The imam wanted to 
revive in us the spirit of self-reliance. 
  Over the last few decades people have said: Iranians? No, 
sir! They joked that domestic goods are not quality products. 
There is no greater injustice to a nation. Our 
domestically-produced goods are today in many instances much 
better than foreign-made goods. [passage omitted] 
  We have many resources. I tell you from the bottom of my 
heart, if anyone wishes to know, that my real aspiration is that 
one day we can turn off the oil well taps and base our economy 
on something other than oil. Let us imagine this country 
without oil. [audience shouts approval] Of course, this may not 
be practical for some time. During the era of the subservient 
and corrupt Pahlavi regime, the enemies of Iran did a great deal 
of sabotage by making this nation and this country dependent on 
oil. The sabotage done was much greater than can be imagined, 
and it makes it impossible for us to realize this aspiration 
easily. But this must be done one day. Such a day will come 
when the Iranian nation utilizes its innate intelligence to stop 
handing these assets to those, who with utmost wickedness, 
exploit the national wealth of oil producing countries. On such 
a day this nation will be able to stand on its own two feet. 
  Today, unfortunately, things are different. Thanks to the 
betrayal of some oil producing countries, and thanks to their 
complicity with the international plundering thieves, oil has 
today become a tool in the hands of the consumers instead of 
serving the interests of the oil producing states by benefiting 
them politically and economically. It has become like an 
inferior commodity, whereas it is a commodity without which the 
world would have no light, no heat, no movement, and no 
industry. Without oil, the modern industrial civilization, 
which is founded on machinery, would grind to a halt. This is 
how important our oil is. When I say our oil, I mean the oil of 
the entire region and the oil resources of the world. Of 
course, this region possesses the main resources, and those 
states which have joined hands with the plunderers unfortunately 
possess the major part of these oil resources. 
  This very valuable commodity has become a tool in the hand 
of 
the consumers, and they are also very dependent on it. They 
began planning a policy such as this dozen of years ago and it 
has today reached fruition. Unfortunately, a handful of 
treacherous statesmen of the subservient states cooperate with 
them. 
  Imagine, however, that the Iranian nation, Iranian workers, 
Iranian youth, Iranian producers, and Iranian teachers were to 
concentrate all their efforts and zeal to build this country by 
altering its exports/imports ratio, by reducing consumer demand 
and foreign currency requirements, and by building this country 
in such a way as to make it free from having to sell its oil at 
such a low price. If all this were to happen, can you imagine 
what great benefits such efforts would bring to this country 
today and in the future? How could this be possible? It would 
be possible when the Iranian worker regards work as true 
worship. [passage omitted] 
  May God bestow his success upon all of us that we may 
understand our obligations and perform our tasks accordingly, 
God willing. May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you 
all.

  [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry 
issued a statement today expressing satisfaction at the 
dismantling of apartheid in South Africa and the victory of the 
African National Congress in that country's elections. The 
statement announced: Our country is ready to do all it can to 
expand bilateral relations in all fields. 
  The statement refers to the Islamic Republic of Iran's 
support for the struggle of the people of South Africa to 
eliminate racism and for cooperation with black struggling 
groups and adds: The Islamic Republic of Iran has always 
supported the establishment of a popular government in South 
Africa through a general election in which all races 
participate, and which is based on the principle of one person, 
one vote. It is in that respect that Iran has sent four 
diplomats, through the United Nations, as observers to the 
elections in South Africa.

  [Text] Tehran, May 4, IRNA -- Following the victory of the 
African National Congress (ANC) in the first free multi-racial 
elections and fall of apartheid in South Africa, Islamic Iran is 
to lift its 15-year-old economic sanctions against that country 
and establish healthy relations between the two countries. 
  Having based its foreign policy on defending rights of the 
world's oppressed, from the triumph of the Islamic revolution in 
1979, Tehran, which severed ties with racist Pretoria, is to 
resume its economic and political relations now that a popularly 
elected government has come to power in South Africa. 
  The Iranian Cabinet approved establishment of 
economic-political ties with South Africa in January 1994 with 
the collapse of apartheid and commissioned the Foreign Ministry 
to pave the way for removing the sanctions against the country 
and set up relations with it. 
  Economic and political experts anticipate establishment of 
firm and multilateral relations between Iran and South Africa 
and foresee steady expansion in the future. 
  According to informed sources, South Africa, which was once 
the main consumer of Iranian oil, intends to resume its economic 
ties with Iran by importing crude oil, and the first official 
agreement to be signed between the two countries is expected to 
include the supply of Iranian crude oil for South African 
refineries. 
  Iran expressed interest in improving its economic and trade 
ties with the country a month after the lifting of United 
Nation's economic sanctions against it. 
  Now it is expected that Iran would play an active and 
substantial role in South Africa's economic programmes and that 
the two countries' volume of exchange would rise to dlrs. 
[dollars] 100 per annum very soon. 
  The valuable experiences of Iranian experts and specialists 
over the years of reconstruction following the victory of the 
revolution would enable them to have an active part in 
development of housing and power generation in South Africa 
which declared it would spend dlrs. 108 billion on housing, 
electricity and employment within the coming five years. 
  [Word indistinct] the lack of a clear prospect in Iran's 
economic relations with South Africa, experts believe that 
mutual interests and connections between the two nations and 
their leaders provide a proper foundation for Tehran and 
Pretoria to build up deep political, economic, cultural and 
social ties.

  [Text] Tehran, May 4, IRNA -- International relations 
experts say Britain's recent claim about Iran's collaboration 
with Northern Ireland is out of spite and unfounded. 
  They say Britain, by propounding such a claim, thinks it can 
ruin relations between Iran and Europe. 
  International relations analyst Farhad Azimi, in his 
interview on Wednesday, says that by alleging an Iranian link to 
the Northern Ireland issue, London intends to give plausibility 
to its age-old hostile propaganda against Islamic Iran. 
  "Prime Minister John Major would do better to realize the 
realities in Iran and discontinue London's efforts at 
antagonizing Europe with Iran, and watch out against playing 
into the hands of certain notorious elements," he added. 
  According to Azimi, the Islamic Republic must revise its 
relations with those governments that are unable to realize the 
factual realities in Iran. 
  College professor and Britain-watcher Dr. Reza Farahmandi 
told IRNA today that since the triumph of the Islamic 
revolution, the British Government has consistently pursued a 
fraudulent policy in its dealings with Iran. 
  He said British arms sales to Iraq during the almost eight 
years of the Iraqi war (1980-88) against Iran, Britain's aids to 
the terrorist grouplets with the idea of them subverting the 
Iranian Government as well as the recent voicing of such 
irrelevant claims as Iran having collaborated with the Irish 
Republican Army (IRA) are all typical examples of Britain's 
schemes for waging a political war with the Islamic republic. 
  "The triumph of the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 in 
fact ended the history of foreign domination in Iran as well as 
any cause for succumbing to any foreign pressure for yielding to 
external threats," he added. 
  Dr. Farahmandi said another goal behind the scheme is for 
the 
British Government to divert attention from the shabby state of 
affairs at home and direct public attention outside of England. 
  He commented that Iran's lobbying at international forums 
for 
the aggressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its exposure of 
grim realities about the discriminative polices of Britain, 
Europe and the U.S. against the continent's native Muslim 
population, has raised doubts about London's claims of 
commitment to human rights and other international conventions 
that disallow the massacre of innocent people of whatsoever 
religious faith, origin and race.

  [Text] Bonn, May 4, IRNA -- An informed source in German 
Government here Tuesday quoted British circles as saying that 
there is no evidence to link Iran with the Irish Republican Army 
(IRA). 
  While British press and the government have added fuel to 
London's latest smear campaign, other European official sources 
have ignored the matter. 
  A German Foreign Ministry spokesman Tuesday told IRNA that 
his government can not comment on British accusation against 
Iran. 
  According to Swiss "NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG" the British 
Government's allegation is based on MI6 intelligence service of 
that country. 
  The paper also said that the British intelligence service 
has 
provided a Greek paper with the information on Iran's aid to the 
IRA, to give London the pretext to take diplomatic measures 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran.

the realization of the principles delineated for Iranian 
pilgrims to the House of God by the great leader of the Islamic 
revolution [Khomeyni], and called upon pilgrims to concentrate 
all their efforts on the exaltation of the principles of pure 
Mohammadan Islam and the bond among Muslims. 
  He expressed the hope that cooperation by the Saudi Arabian 
Government results in the better implementation of the envisaged 
programs for the Iranian pilgrims during the holy period of hajj. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi-Reyshahri called on 
Iranian pilgrims to observe discipline and regulations and 
actively participate in the ceremonies and rites, and warned

pilgrims will perform their religious and divine duties, headed 
by the ceremony of disavowal of infidels.

  [Text] The UN special envoy for Afghan affairs, Mr. Mahmoud 
Mestiri, met Foreign Affairs Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, this 
evening. Mestiri conveyed a report on the outcome of his 
negotiations with the officials of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and 
Afghanistan and said: The United Nations is seeking to find a 
way to end the current crisis in Afghanistan. He also stressed 
the use of the Islamic Republic of Iran's experiences in solving 
the Afghan crisis. 
  Mr. Velayati referred to the Islamic Republic of Iran's 
efforts to return peace to Afghanistan and said: All of that 
country's neighbors stress the establishment of peace and 
stability in Kabul because internal situation in Afghanistan 
also affects its neighbors. 
  The special UN envoy for Afghan affair also spoke to our 
correspondent describing the existing unrest in Kabul as the 
main obstacle on the way to achieve a fundamental solution and 
the return of Afghan refugees to their country. Mr. Mestiri 
agreed that the help provided by the United Nations to the 
Afghan refugees who live in Iran is very little and expressed 
the hope that the UNHCR would pay attention to that matter. 
  On the basis of the same report, the Afghan High 
Coordination 
Council envoys also met and conferred with Mr Velayati this 
evening. Recent developments in Afghanistan were reviewed during 
that meeting.

  [Text] Tehran, May 4, IRNA -- The interior ministers of 
Iran and Pakistan here Wednesday discussed issues of mutual 
interest including Bosnia Herzegovina, Palestine, Afghanistan, 
and Kashmir. 
  Pakistani Minister of the Interior Nasrullah Khan Babar told 
his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Mohammad Besharati, that the war of 
the Serbs against the Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina is "a 
war of the West with the entirety of the Muslim world."

especially of Kashmir. 
  Besharati assured that the Islamic Republic of Iran would 
continue to be on the side of Pakistan. He added that frequent

countries was sufficient proof of the interest of both countries 
in further developing their relations. 
  The Iranian official referred to the combat against drug 
trafficking as a "common issue" about which the two countries 
were equally concerned. He said Iran and Pakistan continued 
their mutual efforts to end that problem.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said we 
are aware of the dimensions of national defense and will not 
accept discrimination or compromise on our security. The prime 
minister was addressing the student officers at the Command and 
Staff College in Quetta today. 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] We are aware of the dimensions of 
our national defense which call for heightened consciousness. 
We are clear about the diagnosis and the prescription. 
National security must always take precedence. 
  Pakistan is a peaceful nation. We are against territorial 
aggrandizement. We are against nuclear proliferation and we 
have exercised commendable self-restraint to demonstrate the 
point, but we do not accept discrimination. A country which has 
had three wars cannot afford to do so. Today it has become 
fashionable to talk about nuclear phraseology, words like 
capping, freezing, roll back are being thrown about in the open 
with abundance without appreciating that national security must 
be accorded collective responsibility. Each day self-centered 
individuals intent on achieving narrow objectives throw about 
strategic issues, indifferent to the damage they inflict on 
national policies. We have said it before and I am saying it 
here today before this august gathering that if even the sun 
melts we will not accept discrimination or compromise on our 
security. The right of survival is the first right. [end 
recording] 
  The prime minister said we are determined to make Pakistan a 
modern welfare state. She said we will have to take strong 
decisions to achieve this objective. The prime minister said 
there is a need to reform our taxation system and we have 
decided to take steps in this direction. The prime minister 
said the next budget will be a step forward for revitalizing the 
economy. She said the government will give firm economic 
foundation to the country to promote free market economy and 
would ensure smooth economic progress and prosperity. 
  Earlier, the commandant of the staff college gave a resume 
of 
the training facilities available at the college. Some military 
officers are also getting training at the college.

  [Text] Islamabad, May 3 -- At long last Pakistan has been 
able to make a breakthrough in acquisition of sophisticated 
defence equipment from Russia for which it has been striving 
hard for decades in its bid to diversify its defence 
procurements. 
  In a major development, to begin with Russia has offered for 
the first time to supply to Pakistan a well-guarded secret 
helicopter technology of co-axial rotors and a helicopter with 
no tail rotor blades. 
  Russia has entered the competition for supply of five 
helicopters to Emergency Relief Cell of the Cabinet division 
along with 30 other companies. Top on the list of Russian 
helicopters is the State-of-Art K-32-T helicopter which not only 
has a reputation of being the safest and the most economical 
helicopter but it also holds the world record of landing at the 
height of over 24,000 feet with two-men crew. What puts this 
helicopter a class apart from the rest of the helicopters is 
that it has no tail rotor blades which improves its flight 
safety upto 40 percent and cuts down maintenance cost by 30 
percent. Russia has also offered M-18, M1-17 and MI-171. 
  Tenders were opened in the committee Room of the Cabinet 
Division on April 30 with 30 companies participating in the bid. 
Tenders were opened in the presence of the D G 
[Director-General] Emergency Relief Cell, Additional Secretary 
Cabinet Division, a representative of the Army and the other 
officials. 
  Emergency Relief Cell of the Cabinet Division had invited 
tenders for the purchase of five helicopter -- three utility 
version and two VIP version. Emergency Relief Cell had acquired 
six UHIH aircraft from the USAID in 1970 for flood relief 
operations. With the expiry of their life-span their 
replacements were urgently required. The participants of the 
bid included the manufacturers, leasing companies and one-time 
go-getters for quick money. Serious offers came from the 
manufacturing plants, from Bell Helicopter Textron USA, 
Eurocopter, the manufacturers of Puma Helicopters from France, 
ULAN-Ude the manufacturers of MI-171 helicopters of another 
manufacturing plant of Russia. Conspicuous by their absence 
from the tender bid were the largest helicopter manufacturing 
plant of Russia Helicopters namely Kazan manufacturing plant. 
Apparently this was aimed at reducing competition for sister 
manufacturing plant of ULAN-Ude. This was evident from the fact 
that ULAN-Ude offered an MI-171 helicopter of utility version at 
US dollars 2.9 million and VIP version at US dollars 3.2 million 
as against the offer of US dollars 1.5 million by Kazan plant to 
Pakistan Army. 
  Prices offered for these helicopters from the original 
manufacturers ranged from 15 million US dollars for Western 
helicopters to US dollars 1.75 million for Russian helicopters. 
Though the go-getter companies also offered helicopters at a low 
price, the competence of these companies to actually deliver the 
helicopters from Russia is seriously doubtful as the laws of the 
Russian Federation do not permit such companies to export 
helicopters for sale, the companies are only permitted to lease. 
  Though the prestigious helicopter manufacturing companies 
from the Western countries are in the run for the tender, what 
makes Russian offer unique is that it has been viewed in the 
defence circles prior to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's visit 
to Moscow sometime in near future. Defence sources have 
confirmed that Russia has been playing quite tough with Pakistan 
on the possibility of defence compensation between the two 
countries over the last two years. 
  Nothwithstanding the public pronouncements made from time to 
time by the Pakistani functionaries for acquiring Russian-made 
fighter-bombers SU27 and MIG 29, Russia had not until very 
recently invited Pakistani experts for evaluations of these 
bombers. Although Pakistani experts have completed evaluation, 
no further progress has been reported. It has also been learnt 
that the scheduled visit by the experts of the Pakistan Army was 
cancelled by their Russian hosts at the eleventh hour last month.

  [Text] Islamabad (PAKISTAN PRESS AGENCY) -- Sindh Chief 
Minister Syed Abdullah Shah has said that cases filed against 
Altaf Hussain, leader of the Muhajir Qaumi Movement [MQM], or 
any of its members will not be withdrawn, and the country's 
politics will be rid of criminal elements. He said that India, 
with the help of its agents, is creating an atmosphere of fear 
and terror through the shooting incidents in Karachi and 
Hyderabad when Pakistan is engaged in drawing the whole world's 
attention to the Kashmir issue. However, I would like to make 
it clear that the Pakistan People's Party government under the 
leadership of Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto is committed to 
eliminating all types of terrorism. The chief minister said 
this while addressing the people on the situation in Karachi on 
television on the evening of 3 May. He said that 22 people, 
including a woman and a child, have been killed so far in the 
disturbances during the last four days. More than one and a 
half dozen policemen and more than 150 innocent citizens have 
also been injured and 70 vehicles have been burned. 
  The chief minister said that all this is being done with the 
intention to cripple Pakistan's industry by making it 
economically and industrially weak and to weaken Pakistan's 
stand on Kashmir. India is carrying out daily propaganda over 
Zee TV that human rights are beng violated in Sindh. MQM leader 
Altaf Hussain has also joined this propaganda. Leading a lavish 
life in London, he made statements saying that his eyes are 
shedding tears of blood over the recent incidents in Karachi. 
The chief minister said that this is a conspiracy not to divide 
Sindh but Pakistan. He said that cases against Altaf Hussain 
were filed by his own allies, meaning, the previous government, 
and the operation in Sindh was also launched during the same 
period, which brought relief and peace to the people of Karachi. 
However, conspiracies were hatched to attack the Army men. 
  The chief minister said that these persons are harming their 
own people. We had offered them the opportunity to join the 
government in the interest of the province and the country. 
Responsible persons in the MQM leadership who want to join us 
in the development of Karachi are being held hostage by 
terrorist elements in the leadership. I am obliged to 
financially assist the families whose members have been killed 
by the terrorists. Owners whose buses and vehicles were burned 
or properties destroyed or damaged should submit their claims. 
They will be compensated. I call upon the people not to allow 
the society being held hostage in the hands of criminal 
elements. In the conclusion, the chief minister said that he 
shares the grief of those who lost relatives in the incidents 
and added that in no case, the criminals will be condoned.

  [Text] Pakistan has said that India is vitiating the 
mutual atmosphere by harping upon the baseless and malicious 
allegations of Pakistan's involvement in Kashmir and some other 
parts of India. A Foreign Office spokesman commenting on the 
recent propaganda campaign against Pakistan launched by Indian 
Government said that Indian Government is trying to divert 
attention from its own failures and brutalities in held Kashmir. 
The Muslim ambassadors based in New Delhi after visiting the 
occupied Kashmir have observed that gross violation of human 
rights are taking place in the valley and the Kashmiris hate 
India. One of the members of the delegation -- the Iranian 
ambassador, Mr. ('Ali Raza Shaykh Ata) -- in a statement has 
said that the program presented to the delegation in New Delhi 
was never implemented. He said the members of the delegation 
were not allowed to visit Hazratbal shrine, Sopor and Bijbiara. 
He said the meeting with the leaders of Hurriet Conference was 
not arranged and we were not allowed even to meet and talk with 
the common people in the valley.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Cairo negotiations, by Umberto De 
Giovannangeli; place and date not given: "Sha'th Is Happy: 
`This Sovereignty Will Not Be a Ghetto'" -- first paragraph is 
L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] Tired but happy, in spite of the dramatic events 
that lent excitement to the signing ceremony: Such is the 
impression given by Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the Cairo negotiations. "The Hebron massacre, 
followed by those in 'Afula and Hadera, drastically worsened the 
situation," Sha'th admits, "but that was just when dialogue 
proved the winning option: We and the Israelis realized that the 
only way to defeat the enemies of peace was to force the pace of 
the negotiations. The agreements are the fruit born of this 
shared awareness." "We are at the beginning of a journey to 
freedom. There are still a lot of obstacles to be removed, 
because 27 years of military occupation have left their mark on 
every aspect of the life of our community, but now we can look 
forward with greater optimism: A new dawn is breaking for 
Palestinians." 
  [De Giovannangeli] What significance does the PLO attribute 
to the agreement reached in Cairo? 
  [Sha'th] It is the beginning of a journey to freedom that 
will lead to the constitution of a Palestinian state. Not now, 
of course, but sooner than envisaged even in the Washington 
agreement. In this respect, in spite of the issues that it still 
leaves open, the Cairo agreement marks a point of no return. 
  [De Giovannangeli] On what do you base your optimism? 
  [Sha'th] In the months following the handshake between Rabin 
and 'Arafat, the messages coming out of the occupied territories 
all had a common denominator: Demonstrate, immediately, that 
peace was not only a signature. Well, even though we are 
running behind schedule, we can now show that life in the 
territories really can change. Thousands of Palestinians 
detained for years in Israeli jails can return to their 
families, and there will be Palestinian police to ensure peace. 
In a nutshell, peace begins to take a visible shape. And this 
can only have a positive impact on the attitudes of Palestinians 
in the territories. 
  [De Giovannangeli] You have called it an agreement that 
paves 
the way for a future Palestinian state. On what do you base 
this assessment? 
  [Sha'th] On a number of factors that, taken together, give 
the impression of "sovereignty in the making." We will have our 
airline and the right to fish in Mediterranean waters off the 
Gaza Strip, where the Israelis have been barring our fishing 
boats to date. We will have our stamps, an international 
dialing code different from Israel's, and, above all, identity 
documents bearing the word "passport." People will begin to see 
Palestinian harbors, airports, television channels, and economic 
institutions. Two million people will realize that, for the 
first time in their lives, they can write the agenda for their 
own future. We will have full powers over the legislature, over 
our basic laws, we will be able to decide on our own on the 
nature of our civic and social life. This is why I refer to a 
"new dawn" for the Palestinian people. One thing is certain: 
Jericho and Gaza will not be self-governing ghettos. 
  [De Giovannangeli] Your talk about a "new dawn," but the 
Hamas fundamentalists could darken it with further terrorist 
attacks. 
  [Sha'th] Creating peace is the best way to curb extremist 
tendencies; we have succeeded in concluding the first stage of 
the negotiations in the light of this awareness. Hamas' 
strength was enhanced by people's disappointment about the lack 
of visible signs of change. But now things will change, of that 
I am convinced, and they will change faster and more visibly if 
the international community gives our efforts to establish peace 
concrete support. Massive economic, technological, and 
scientific investment in the territories is essential to 
strengthen our autonomy and train a new governing class. This 
is what we now need, not just words of encouragement. As far as 
Hamas is concerned, I would add that these last few weeks have 
seen signs of a new readiness to talk on the part of the 
movement's leaders. 
  [De Giovannangeli] And what is the PLO's reply? 
  [Sha'th] The unity of the Palestinian people is a valuable 
asset and, as such, it must be safeguarded. But from now on, 
all our energy must be channeled into building up our autonomy 
and achieving prosperity and freedom in the territories. We 
have to turn over a new leaf, moving on from fighting against 
the occupying troops to creating our state. If Hamas intends to 
share in this project, it is welcome. But should it prejudice 
the outcome with acts of terrorism, we are ready to use any 
means to put a stop to it. 
  [De Giovannangeli] When may we expect to see 'Arafat in the 
"autonomous territories"? 
  [Sha'th] It is only a question of weeks, now; it all depends 
on how long the Israeli withdrawal takes. They are preparing 
the premises where 'Arafat will have his offices and residence 
in Jericho. He is due in at the beginning of June, and his 
arrival will enable us to begin our journey toward our ultimate 
goal: the Palestinian state.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Political Department Head </F>
Faruq Qaddumi by Kamal Tarabayh on 4 May; place not given; from 
the "Today's Guest" feature -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Tarabayh] Brother Faruq Qaddumi, PLO Political 
Department chief, good evening. 
  [Qaddumi] Good evening. Welcome. 
  [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-al-Lutf [Qaddumi's nom de guerre], 
the first question that comes to mind is: Why didn't you attend 
the agreement signing ceremony in Cairo. 
  [Qaddumi] This has been my position since the very 
beginning, and it has not changed. It is a position of caution 
and carefulness because the Palestinian people have not achieved 
their aspirations. We are now confronting a new challenge. We 
face a hard test. But we will not give in to despair. We will 
face these difficulties with confident hearts. 
  [Tarabayh] You refused to go to Washington when the 
Declaration of Principles Agreement was signed. But you then 
made a statement stressing the importance of the Palestinian 
people's unity. What would you say to Palestinians today? 
  [Qaddumi] At this important, difficult phase in history, we 
say the Palestinian national struggle will continue 
relentlessly.... 
  [Tarabayh, interrupting] ...the armed struggle? 
  [Qaddumi] The Palestinian national struggle, by all means. 
It will continue relentlessly and its fire will not end. We 
are fighting for a legitimate cause in order to regain our 
legitimate rights from an usurping enemy that is supported by 
strong world powers. Despite this, our people's determination 
to resist continues and our intifadah inside the occupied 
territories will remain until the last Israeli soldier leaves 
our blessed Palestinian soil. We are advocates of peace, but we 
reject surrender. We believed in the peace process on clear 
foundations, which have not been realized yet. We were certain 
about these foundations--the land-for-peace formula--from the 
very beginning, and we will achieve that goal, God willing, 
regardless of how long it takes. 
  [Tarabayh] Abu-al-Lutf, do you think the agreement signed 
today in Cairo is a step forward or backward on the path of 
peace? 
  [Qaddumi] In fact, we are facing difficult options as I have 
said. We must choose the least of two evils. We can judge what 
was signed today through experience. I am completely optimistic 
that our people will continue their national struggle to create 
the appropriate conditions that will serve their objective in 
national independence and the creation of their state with holy 
Jerusalem as its capital. 
  [Tarabayh] There is discussion now about the formation of a 
Palestinian government with members from inside and outside the 
occupied territories. Will Abu-al-Lutf join such a government? 
  [Qaddumi] What kind of government are we talking about, 
especially since there is nothing complete yet? There is no 
room for a government. There may be room for leaders or for a 
national Palestinian authority. 
  [Tarabayh] As head of the PLO Political Department, were you 
in full agreement with the other members of the PLO Executive 
Committee, especially President Yasir 'Arafat, about the 
agreement signed today? 
  [Qaddumi] I think brother Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat], as was clear 
from what we saw on television, was angry and unhappy about what 
he was presented with. But as I have said, it was an 
inescapable evil. 
  [Tarabayh] But why was he unhappy knowing that the signing 
ceremony was, according to the Palestinian party in particular, 
preceded by hard, intensive, and lengthy negotiations that 
covered all aspects? 
  [Qaddumi] But at the last moment, there were some points the 
Israelis agreed on initially but then rejected. 
  [Tarabayh] You are one of the historical leaders of 
Palestinian national action and you are a founding member of 
Fatah. On this occasion, on this important occasion, what do you 
say to the supporters and opposers of the agreement within the 
Palestinian people? 
  [Qaddumi] I tell everyone that at this difficult phase we 
must not transfer our rage to the inside. It should be directed 
against the Israeli enemy who usurped our land. The fault is 
not ours, but that of those powerful forces, the Zionist forces 
that usurped Palestinian land and expelled our people. It is 
our destiny to stand united to continue this resistance, and to 
continue the construction in order to create new facts on the 
ground, without showing any sign of exhaustion. We will not 
give in to despair. We will continue this march. The march of 
history, which doomed certain states to collapse, will also doom 
our enemy to failure. We are hopeful that, through the 
developments in today's world, we will triumph, God willing. 
  [Tarabayh] Do you think the agreement signed today is an 
initial step on the path to establishing the independent 
Palestinian state? 
  [Qaddumi] We will discuss the details of this agreement. If 
there were positive points, then every leader, official, and the 
rank-and-file must take advantage of this opportunity to 
buttress all resources so we can continue this struggle until we 
reach national independence. I am certain we will get there 
soon. 
  [Tarabayh] At this moment in particular, where does 
Abu-al-Lutf stand? How optimistic or pessimistic is Abu-al-Lutf? 
  [Qaddumi] I have never been a pessimist. I am an optimist 
by nature. We started this revolution from nothing and 
generations joined it and excelled in fighting the Israeli 
enemy. The people were never tired. This is a long march but 
the signs of victory can, God willing, be seen on the horizon. 
  [Tarabayh] You undoubtedly remember at these times the 
brothers and comrades who fell on the path of struggle, 
particularly Fatah Central Committee members such as Abu-Jihad 
[Khalil al-Wazir] and Abu--Iyad [Salah Khalaf] and the other 
martyrs. Do you have anything to say on this occasion? 
  [Qddumi] To these heroic martyrs, to the martyrs who fell 
for the sake of the Palestine cause and for the liberation of 
Palestine, I say one word: We remain faithful to the pledge. 
We will continue our struggle until we realize the hope for 
which they fought and for which we started the revolution 
together to achieve that noble goal, national independence and 
sovereignty over our land, regardless of the sacrifices. 
  [Tarabayh] And to the children of the stone: Are they 
required today or in the near future to drop the stones and move 
to other forms? 
  [Qaddumi] I say to these younger generations: Hold on to 
the stone until the last Israeli soldier leaves Palestinian 
soil. Blessed be they, and greetings to them and to all future 
generations that will build Palestine with their strong arms; 
and until the occupation is terminated and until we establish 
the pillars of peace. We are advocates of peace but we reject 
capitulation. The late Tunisian poet, Abu-al-Qasim, once said: 
Despite illness and enemies, I will remain like an eagle 
standing on a lofty summit. 
  [Tarabayh] Faruq Qaddumi, Abu-al-Lutf, thank you for this 
interview. 
  [Qaddumi] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee member Shafiq al-Hut </F>
by an unidentified correspondent in Beirut on 4 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Hut] Although I have not acquainted myself with 
the details of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, I think it is 
based on the Israeli interpretation of the Oslo Agreement. This 
is also what happened with regard to the other agreements, such 
as that on the crossings, which was signed in Cairo. Perhaps 
what we and millions of viewers saw today when Yasir 'Arafat 
refused to sign the agreements and then finally submitted to 
various pressures and made another concession to ensure the 
success of the ceremony proves this point. But this does not 
rule out that the signing of this agreement constitutes a 
significant move in the sense that the differences over the 
negotiations will be seen on the ground, in the popular arena. 
I think there is cause for concern when the implementation 
takes place according to the Israeli interpretation. The 
Palestinian Arab people will discover the grave loss suffered by 
the Palestinian cause as a result of the Oslo Agreement, the 
basis of all the agreements, including today's agreement. 
  [Correspondent] What are the prospects for the peace process 
in the area after the signing of the agreement? 
  [Al-Hut] My feeling is that we are drawing away from peace 
more than many people think, especially those who support this 
process according to the current framework and agreements. The 
situation of the Palestinian people has not changed. Perhaps it 
is even worse than before 13 September 1993. There has been no 
progress on the Lebanese, Syrian, or Jordanian tracks. This 
means there is still a long way to go. This way is fraught with 
dangers. I see the possibilities for an explosion are perhaps 
greater than the possibilities for peace.

<F P=106> [By Akram al-Khatib] </F>
  [Text] Bassam Abu-Sharif, one of Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat's advisers, has said he believes the Israeli 
military will complete its withdrawal from the territories 
defined by the Gaza-Jericho First agreement long ahead of 
schedule. 
  The Palestinian and Israeli sides had agreed that Israel's 
withdrawal would take place four months after the signing at the 
latest. 
  In statements to AL-ASWAQ here in Amman, Bassam Abu-Sharif 
said President 'Arafat will likely enter the liberated areas in 
June, 1994. Speaking on the eve of the signing of the Cairo 
agreement, Abu-Sharif said preparations for the entry of the 
Palestinian police, 9000-strong, and the presidential staff and 
security personnel and bodyguards have been in the making for 
some time, and these are now ready to take over any minute. 
  The transition period amounts to more than a secondary 
stage, 
according to Abu-Sharif. The first step calls for empowerment 
of the national authority in Jericho and Gaza, the second for 
Israeli forces to redeploy in the rest of the West bank nine 
months after the start of the implementation of the first step. 
  Abu-Sharif indicated that Jerusalem was excluded from the 
agreement on the understanding that it will be addressed in the 
final stage. Procedures for entry to Gaza and Jericho will be 
different from those in force now, and the same holds for the 
rest of the West Bank nine months later. 
  Abu-Sharif said robust economic relations between the state 
of Palestine and Arab states is essential if the Palestinians 
are to tackle the problems that naturally lie ahead, including 
building an infrastructure and effecting economic development 
programs. It is impossible for Palestinians in the liberated 
areas to translate economic programs into realities on the 
ground without joining hands with Jordan. Relations between the 
Palestinians and Jordanians are of the sort that exist in one 
family. Such cooperation should enable the Palestinians to 
stand up to Israel's covetous plans. The economic agreement 
signed between Jordan and the PLO a few months ago marks the 
foundations for building economic structures. 
  Abu-Sharif said pledges have been made by donor nations to 
fund key projects. He said there are bilateral agreements 
between the PLO and the European Union, as well as Arab and 
foreign countries. The funds committed for the reconstruction 
effort over the coming three years may be in the order of $5 
billion, not counting the money to be invested in the 
Palestinian economy by private Palestinian and Arab sectors. 
  He said the widespread feeling of anxiety gripping 
Palestinians inside and in the diaspora, as well as Arabs around 
Palestine, is understandable, becuase the near future holds 
major changes, whose consequences cannot be accurately 
predicted. I think, though, that coordination and cooperation 
between the Palestinians and Arabs should be able not only to 
end the state of anxiety but also to mobilize energies to tackle 
all the challenges. 
  Abu-Sharif applauded the recent agreement between Fatah and 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], noting that a cardinal rule 
among the Palestinians is to refrain from the use of violence in 
resolving their domestic differences. Adherence to this 
principle is essential if peace and the reconstruction effort 
are to succeed. 
  I am confident that all parties will obligate themselves to 
this rule, not excluding Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement. 
  Palestinian democracy can accommodate divergent views no 
matter how far apart they are. But there is no place in 
Palestinian democracy for the advocates of violence as a means 
to impose their will on others. I am confident that Hamas is no 
less patriotic or enlightened than other Palestinians. Hamas 
will, therefore, play by the rule and deny whoever wants to harm 
the Palestinian people the chance to do so. 
  Abu-Sharif said President 'Arafat issued a presidential 
decree to launch a Palestinian aviation authority a while back. 
Discussion of practicalities of the project will take place 
later.

  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- In his first assessment 
of the agreement expected to be finally signed in Cairo 4 May, 
Mamduh Nawfal, President 'Arafat's adviser on security affairs, 
said that, in the main details, what was agreed represented the 
maximum the PLO could get in the circumstances but did not 
fulfill our aspirations and only met minimum Palestinian 
demands. He added: But in essence, the agreement is considered 
to be positive. For the first time since the signing of the 
Washington agreement last September, a timetable has been agreed 
for implementation. The agreement also allows the emergence of 
limited authority in the Palestinian areas. 
  In a telephone interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from Tunis, 
Nawfal summed up the points in the agreement as follows: "In 
addition to the timetable, the most important achievement was 
the participation of international forces from six states which 
are providing aid, for the first time linking Gaza and Jericho 
with Hebron. The agreement also met Israel's maximum security 
demands and maximum Palestinian economic demands, in addition to 
a reasonable level of national sovereignty symbols such as 
travel documents, an international dialing code, and an 
independent postal system and stamps." 
  Sources in Amman and Tunis say that the timetable for the 
entry of the Palestinian police forces into the areas of limited 
autonomy is as follows: 
  "An advance Palestinian exploration and initial arrangements 
unit consisting of 22-28 Palestinian officers will set up a 
liaison office with Israeli officers to make preparations to 
receive the first police force units next Thursday or Friday. 
It will be followed three days later by a force consisting of 
100 officers and policemen. On 22 May, the date set for the 
completion of the two-week Israeli withdrawal, a force 
consisting of 6,000 policemen and their families will begin to 
arrive in Gaza and Jericho, to be followed one week later by 
1,000 policemen and their families in addition to 400 
technicians and administrative officials to make the necessary 
arrangements for receiving the Palestian leadership headed by 
Yasir 'Arafat, who will return as PLO chairman and not in any 
other capacity, according to the agreement." 
  As regards prisoners and detainees, the agreement stipulates 
that "1,000 Palestinian detainees will be released the day the 
agreement is signed, 4 May, and 500 detainees a day later. 
After the completion of the withdrawal of the Israeli Army, 
2,000 prisoners serving long sentences, from all Palestinian 
organizations, will be released. More negotiations will begin 
13 July for the gradual release of the remaining detainees, 
starting with the release of 2,000 detainees. [no closing 
quotation mark] 
  According to Palestinian sources, the agreement stipulates 
that the detainees who belong to Palestinian opposition factions 
should give a written undertaking not to carry out "military" 
operations against the settlements or inside Israel, and to 
support the new Palestinian authority and respect the laws 
within its boundaries. On the economic front, the Palestinian 
sources said that the most important Israeli concession was 
exemption from tax and customs duties for the list of 
commodities submitted by the Palestinians and linked to the 
infrastructure. That list is subject to the requirements and 
assessments of the Palestinian authority on a free import basis. 
Another point is related to Palestinian employment and 
regulations organizing that inside Israel. The agreement 
stipulates that the Palestinian authority will supervise the 
employment regulations in agreement with the Israeli Government. 
  Another point is the acceptance of the shekel as a main 
currency, not the official currency, in circulation in the 
autonomy area. 
  As regards the area identified as the gray area in the 
agreement maps, namely the al-Mawasi agricultural area on the 
Gaza coast, it has been reduced from the 57 square kilometers 
requested by the Israelis to 36 square kilometers. 
  The two sides agreed on a compromise solution on the 
question 
of "judicial jurisdiction." It was agreed that Israelis and 
foreign tourists who commit violations in the security area 
adjacent to the Israeli settlements would be tried in Israeli 
courts, and that the Palestinian judicial authorities would be 
kept informed of the investigations; whereas Israelis and 
tourists who commit violations in the autonomy region would be 
tried by Palestinian courts. 
  As regards the disputed issues which have been referred to 
the 4 May meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
and 'Arafat in Cairo, they are related to the Israeli crossing 
points on the King Husayn Bridge, Palestinian currency, and 
territorial waters. Negotiations between the two sides will 
continue in Cairo until the day after tomorrow, when a 
preparatory meeting will be held between Rabin and 'Arafat to 
pave the way for the signing the following day, in the hope that 
the obstacles and disputed details will have been resolved by 
then. 
  The Palestinian sources added that the agreement, which runs 
to 85 pages, also stipulates that the Palestine National Council 
will hold an emergency meeting in the limited autonomy region in 
which the Palestinian national charter will be openly revoked.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jericho Mayor Jamil Khalaf, in </F>
Jericho, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo, on 5 May; from the 
"Dialogue From Afar" program --recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] As we begin this dialogue we would 
like you to give us an idea of the feelings of the Palestinian 
public, specifically in Jericho, toward the agreement signed in 
Cairo yesterday. 
  [Khalaf] The Palestinian people in Jericho were in a state 
of 
great joy. They raised flags. The boy scouts beat drums and 
blew trumpets. The whole Palestinian people in Jericho were 
very joyful. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do the Palestinian people view the 
future? 
  [Khalaf] This agreement is a historic step after the signing 
[of the Declaration of Principles] on 13 September 1993 in 
Washington. This particular step marks the beginning of the 
first phase in the life of the Palestinian people. For the 
first time, the Palestinian people will govern themselves 
through self-rule in Jericho and Gaza. The area is not 
insignificant. It has a population of approximately 1 million. 
This is an important and historic step in the life of the 
Palestinian people. We hope and implore God that it will be a 
good and constructive step toward establishing peace in the 
whole region. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Differences centered on the Jericho area. 
What agreement has been reached regarding the size of the 
Jericho area? 
  [Khalaf] There are promises. As we understand it, there is a 
promise by the U.S. secretary of state. There should be no 
differences over the border. The important thing is that the 
self-rule plan in the two areas was signed. This is very 
important for the Palestinian people. The borders will be in 
accordance with the agreement and the peace plan signed by 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Won't a new phase begin that will require 
the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides to deal with each other? 
  [Khalaf] During the current phase the areas must be opened 
up 
so that Palestinian citizens will enjoy a kind of prosperity. 
In the period preceding the talks the areas were closed. This 
closure caused great hardship for the Palestinian citizens and a 
recession in the Palestinian economy. We hope that the means of 
livelihood will be opened for the Palestinian people so that 
their economy will thrive. Economy is the most important thing 
in the people's life. We hope there will be aid and mutual 
economic cooperation between the Palestinian and Israeli 
peoples. Naturally, we need foreign aid from the European 
Union, the World Bank, the United States, and other foreign and 
Arab states. Over 27 years the Israeli and Palestinian 
economies have merged. It is difficult now to separate the 
Israeli economy from the Palestinian economy. This separation 
will take much time. But now there are direct trade dealings 
and contacts between the Israeli and Palestinian economies. It 
is difficult to stop or reduce these dealings. The Palestinian 
people must feel there is economic prosperity and an increase in 
their income. 
  The Jericho area is an agricultural and tourist area. We 
must export our goods to other towns, including Israeli towns. 
We do not have factories or plants. We have agriculture. 
Jericho is the agricultural capital of the Jordan valley. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Are there preparations in Jericho and the 
occupied Palestinian territories to receive the Palestinian 
national authority? 
  [Khalaf] Yes, we are awaiting the arrival of our Palestinian 
brothers [from abroad]. We are one family and one people. We 
are waiting impatiently for the arrival of our brother 
Palestinians who will take over authority and establish law and 
order. This is the most important step in our life. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] As we end this dialogue, we thank you. We 
always welcome you to the Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Khalaf] I thank President Muhammad Husni Mubarak for his 
titanic efforts. I also thank the Egyptian people for receiving 
the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and for their efforts toward 
establishing peace in the region.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Layla Shahid, the Palestinian </F>
representative in France, by correspondent Franz-Olivier 
Giesbert; place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Layla Shahid, good morning. 
  [Shahid] Good morning. 
  [Giesbert] I guess you are quite thrilled this morning, 
aren't you? 
  [Shahid] Certainly. 
  [Giesbert] Are you thrilled by history in the making? 
  [Shahid] In any case, it is a historic day. A page which is 
being turned. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Do you feel like thanking Shimon Peres this 
morning on Europe 1? 
  [Shahid] Yes, yes, yes. In any case, I would like to pay 
homage to him because I believe that, of all the men who 
negotiated, he is the one who had -- who has -- a vision of 
Israel in time of peace, Israel after the Cold War, and I hope 
that it is this particular vision that will prevail, because up 
against it, there is another military vision of Israel that 
still exists within the government. We shall see which one will 
prevail. 
  [Giesbert] And what do you make of Yitzhak Rabin, the prime 
minister? 
  [Shahid] I believe that Yitzhak Rabin was brave when he 
followed Peres' plan to integrate Israel into the Middle East. 
  [Giesbert] He said what had to be said, didn't he? 
  [Shahid] Yes, he said what had to be said. I hope he will 
have the courage to continue because this agreement is now faced 
with the text that has to be implemented. We must not forget 
that there are many difficulties remaining. There are 120,000 
settlers still there, and Mr. Rabin still insists that they 
should be kept in the territories even though they are risking 
their own safety. I believe that there many other tests ahead 
for Mr. Rabin, and I hope he will continue on the way he has 
started. It is the only way for his people to survive; that is, 
in peace with their neighbors. 
  [Giesbert] You were talking about dangers, Layla Shahid. But 
who do you actually fear most? Tell us now, without any jargon. 
Are you more afraid of the hysterical Israeli settlers or the 
frantic fundamentalists, the religious fanatics of Hamas? 
  [Shahid] I am afraid of both for different reasons. I am 
afraid of Palestinian fundamentalists because they support a 
kind of society I do not support. However, they have everything 
to gain from peace, namely normal, healthy and free life, and I 
believe that they will accept the rules of the game, but I am 
even more afraid of the settlers because they have everything to 
lose, namely the territory where they live and their special 
status, and I believe that they will use all possible means to 
sabotage this peace, but, unfortunately, this is a problem and a 
duty for the Israeli Government, not for ours. 
  [Giesbert] A Palestinian transitional government will now 
manage what we call the Palestinian entity until the general 
elections. How will those Palestinians chosen for the 
transition be appointed? Will there be people from the Hamas 
Movement, for instance? 
  [Shahid] They will be appointed in a balanced way between 
inside and outside the occupied territories to start with. 
  [Giesbert] Do you mean that there will be people from the 
Hamas Movement? 
  [Shahid] It is possible, if they agree to be responsible for 
the administration of this territory, yes, why not. They 
represent a political strength in Palestinian society. It would 
be stupid politically to try to marginalize them. We have seen 
what this led to in a country like Algeria. However, the most 
important ... 
  [Giesbert, interrupting] But they will not work towards 
peace, will they? 
  [Shahid] That is not obvious. I believe that, in any case, 
all political forces must be given a chance in a democratic 
fashion, whether they belong to the right or the left. However, 
the most important thing is the way the blending between the 
inside and the outside will take place. This transitional 
government will probably be balanced with 50 percent PLO leaders 
and 50 percent local leaders, and I believe the most important 
thing is the preparation of the elections, which will take place 
in the autumn since we have missed the date scheduled for July. 
People will decide through their votes who they want as their 
representatives. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Layla Shahid, thank you, good luck, have a nice 
day. 
  [Shahid] Thank you.

  [Text] Approximately 700 Palestinian prisoners, released 
from Qezi'ot prison in the Negev, arrived in the Gaza Strip 
today within the framework of the agreement that Israel and the 
PLO signed in Cairo. Another 300 freed prisoners returned to 
their homes in the West Bank. Our correspondent said all the 
freed prisoners are Fatah Movement members, except two from the 
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, and two others from the 
Islamic Jihad. These four prisoners pledged to support the 
peace march. 
  Fourteen deportees, most of whom are Fatah Movement members, 
returned to the territories across the Allenby bridge this 
afternoon. They were accompanied by 35 of the members of their 
families. These deportees are expected to join the Palestinian 
teams that will run the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Seventeen Palestinian police officers also arrived in Gaza 
Strip across the Rafah crossing point today. They will join the 
Palestinian Military Liaison Committee, which will coordinate 
with the Israeli liaison committee on the issue of transferring 
some of the Gaza Strip area that the Israeli Defense Army and 
police will leave, as well as the deployment of the Palestinian 
police.

  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has only released 
approximately 380 Palestinian prisoners. Approximately 250 
freed prisoners arrived in the Gaza Strip and the remainder in 
Judaea and Samaria. This was reported by Palestinian sources 
this evening to our correspondent Moti Amir. 
  The sources claimed that the IDF had presented erroneous 
figures and misled the media with regard to the exact number 
prisoners released. Our correspondent notes that IDF sources 
this evening confirmed that due to last-minute technical 
problems, less than 400 Palestinian prisoners were released 
today, and not 1,000 as originally intended.

  [Text] Al-'Arish, 4 May (MENA)--A delegation from the 
Palestinian police's Liaison Committee made up of 19 officers 
led by Brigadier General Ghazi 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jibali crossed 
the Rafah border point to explore the Palestinian police's areas 
of deployment. The delegation members also will coordinate with 
the Israeli sides on the takeover of sites in Gaza and Jericho, 
in preparation for the deployment of the Palestinian police as 
of tomorrow, Thursday. 
  Approximately 1,000 Palestinian policemen are expected to 
enter the self-rule areas in the coming hours to start their 
work in keeping law and order in the territories. Eyewitnesses 
have affirmed that Israel continues to transfer the Israeli 
security and army camps to make room for the coming Palestinian 
policemen. The Palestinians have prepared themselves to receive 
the self-rule authority with celebrations, marches of support, 
and Palestinian flags. 
  In another development, the occupation troops have imposed a 
security siege on the self-rule areas to prevent Israeli 
settlers and extremists from entering these areas for fear of 
confrontation with the Palestinians.

<F P=106> [By Barry Parker] </F>
  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, May 4 (AFP) -- 
Autonomy came at last to the Gaza Strip and Jericho on Wednesday 
[4 May] with the start of a mass prisoner release and the 
arrival of police top brass to take over from Israel. 
  "We are starting to take charge from today," PLO 
brigadier-general Ziyad 'Arif told AFP. "We are starting our 
real duties as Palestinian police." 
  "The autonomy agreement is working now," he said after a 
19-strong PLO delegation including four generals entered Gaza 
from Egypt, forming a liaison committee for the security 
transfer. 
  Israel and the Palestinians would draw up a takeover 
timetable on Thursday, following the signing of the self-rule 
accord in Cairo on Wednesday. 
  Three of the delegation went by Israeli jeep to the West 
Bank 
town of Jericho and the remainder on a tour of Gaza security 
installations. 
  An advance party of 1,000 policemen will arrive in Gaza over 
the weekend, 'Arif said, forming the vanguard of a 9,000-strong 
force. 
  In Jericho, hundreds of children threw flowers instead of 
stones at Israeli troops. They climbed the police station fence 
and put up Palestinian flags as well as palm leaves. 
  Youngsters marched through the West Bank oasis of 15,000 
people singing patriotic songs, but it all turned sour when 
police fired tear-gas and rubber bullets after stones were 
thrown. Four people were treated in hospital. 
  At Khan Yunus, three masked Palestinians killed an 
11-year-old, wounded his father and another relative in a 
bungled kidnapping attempt. 
  In Gaza City, dozens of teenagers lobbed rocks at soldiers 
outside the central jail, as they waited for prisoners to be 
freed. 
  The release of 1,000 prisoners on Wednesday began right 
after 
Israel and the PLO signed the accord to launch Palestinian 
self-rule. Four are Islamic fundamentalists, the rest from 
Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah movement. 
  "Peace is wonderful," shouted Umm-Majid Sharif, 55, as the 
first men stepped off buses to a flag-waving, tabla-beating 
reception at Nahal Oz crossing into Gaza. 
  "The war is over between us and Israel," she said. "We want 
all the prisoners to be freed now the agreement has been signed." 
  Sharif's son Rami was not freed, but she refused to be 
discouraged amid the kissing, sobbing and singing as hundreds 
turned out to give their loved ones a hero's welcome home. 
  'Adnan Susi, 35, ran into his brother 'Adil's arms and they 
just hugged for several minutes as the tears flowed. 
  "I'm crying because I'm so happy. I had two years of a 
five-year sentence left to do," he said. 
  PLO official Sufyan Abu-Zaydah said: "More will be released 
on Thursday and that should make a total of about 2,500 from all 
the occupied territories." 
  Under the Cairo deal, another 2,500 are to be freed when the 
Israelis have completed withdrawal within three weeks. The PLO 
has demanded that the remaining 5,000 be released, but 
timetables still have to be negotiated. 
  All those up for release have to sign a paper pledging 
support for autonomy. 
  Israel had let 1,678 prisoners out in several batches since 
last October in a bid to spur the autonomy talks. However 
hundreds have also been arrested since then. 
  It took two attempts for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and 
'Arafat to sign their agreement and not surprisingly there was 
no repeat of the mass celebrations which greeted the September 
13 Declaration of Principles. 
  Tens of thousands poured on to Gaza's streets more than 
seven 
months ago. This time they were more cautious. 
  Shopkeepers hung up flags and a few dozen supporters paraded 
around on trucks, horns honking, shouting pro-'Arafat slogans. 
  "I won't believe anything has changed until I see the last 
Israeli soldiers leave," said 25-year-old Muhammad Balah, a 
shopkeeper in Shatti refugee camp. 
  "Officially Fatah is not organizing any celebrations. We 
leave that to our people on the street to do what they feel," 
PLO official Rashid Abu-Shibak said. 
  "May 4 is a unique day in Palestinian history ... our 
authority will be manifest in our homeland," Fatah said in a 
statement. 
  "The Palestinians will be able to live in a freedom that has 
been denied over so many years by the occupation. 
  "The historical agreement is the product of a process of 
struggle by the Palestinians and for which many gave their lives. 
  "We still have a long and a hard way to go but the 
achievement so far is a first step for us which requires 
everybody to be united ... so we can all reach the final stages 
and establish an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as 
its eternal capital." 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS), vowing to fight on 
against Israel, declared two days of mourning and urged people 
to hoist black flags against autonomy. 
  Few black flags were on view.

  [Excerpt] You can imagine that people in Israel followed 
this morning's events with a lot of attention, concern, and 
hope. The first Palestinian police officers have arrived in the 
occupied territories and in Gaza. As for our special 
correspondents, Isabelle Baechler and Patrick Voigt, they were 
in the company of Palestinians opposed to this autonomy treaty: 
  [Baechler] It is 1130 in a house in the Beach Camp district 
of the town of Gaza. Most of the men watching the historic 
moment of the signing in Cairo are on the list of terrorists who 
are most wanted by the Israeli Army. They are Fatah Hawks, the 
military branch of Yasir 'Arafat's organization. They are a bit 
sullen, despite the process of autonomy which is under way: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified Fatah Hawk, in Arabic, with 
superimposed French translation] We are happy. We have been 
waiting for this moment for a long time, but we fear that 
nothing may come of it. This is not the first time that 
agreements have been signed, but thus far we have not seen any 
change. 
  [Second unidentified Fatah Hawk in Arabic, with superimposed 
French translation] We are happy, but we are still wanted. 
Normal people are rejoicing, but we are still in hiding. 
  [Third unidentified Fatah Hawk in Arabic, with superimposed 
French translation] All right, they are signing today, but as 
recently as yesterday the Army erected roadblocks to capture us. 
[end recording] 
  [Baechler] The Fatah Hawks will not lay down their weapons 
until the new Palestinian authorities ask them to do so. What 
is different for them today is the fact that they feel closer to 
the new power. The entire population of Gaza is hoping. These 
800,000 Palestinians packed together on 375 square kilometers 
are waiting for signs of sovereignty from their future state. 
For the time being, nothing has changed. Israeli soldiers are 
still here, right in the center of Gaza. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Islamic Jihad' Hints at Possible </F>
Halt to its Operations in Gaza Strip"] 
  [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, 
secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement, has told 
AL-HAYAH that the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement between 
Israel and the PLO today "prompts us to reconsider the nature of 
military action" in the Gaza Strip after the self-rule 
authority's entry. He pointed out that he will work toward 
increasing the movement's "political effectiveness" while 
continuing military action in the same manner in the other 
occupied territories. 
  Al-Shaqaqi said in Damascus yesterday that "in the event of 
the Palestinian authority's entry into Gaza, we will reconsider 
the nature of military action there. But we will continue 
[military action] in the same manner in the West Bank, 
Jerusalem, and the 1948 territory." He added that military 
action will continue, "and we will not suspend it during the 
reconsideration period. The confrontation methods will be 
linked to the nature of the Israeli presence in the Strip." 
  He pointed out that the Jihad Movement does not object to 
"political moves in the Strip away from the self-rule authority 
and its institutions. We will push toward the broadest 
political movement possible, whose motive power is the jihad." 
  On the nature of the future relationship with Fatah and the 
administrative self-rule authority, al-Shaqaqi said that the 
"Jihad's" history is closely linked to Fatah. 
  He added: "There are personal ties between Fatah and Jihad 
sons. This personal relationship could become a channel through 
which to solve some of the problems" that may emerge between the 
two sides. 
  He pointed out that he has no "desire to fight over power. 
Nevertheless, the possibility of a confrontation exists. If 
they judge us because of our jihad against Israel, 
confrontations would occur between us." 
  On his opinion of the agreement to be signed today, the 
Jihad 
secretary general said that he considers "this day a danger in 
our history, and (Palestinian President Yasir) 'Arafat has sold 
his soul for the sake of his body and is trying to sell the 
Palestinian people's soul in return for their remaining alive 
politically."

  [Text] Damascus, May 4 (AFP) -- Hardline Palestinian groups 
opposed to the Middle East peace process condemned the 
Palestinian self-rule accord signed in Cairo Wednesday [4 May] 
and vowed to continue the armed stuggle against Israel. 
  Damascus-based Palestinian groups described PLO chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat as a "traitor" who had "sold out" the Palestinian 
cause by signing the accord with Israel to launch self-rule in 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  Meanwhile, Palestinian refugees voiced anger and bitterness, 
saying the agreement ignored them, as it only provided for 
limited self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The PLO's main rival in the occupied territories, the 
Islamic 
Resistance Movement, Hamas, said in a statement here the 
Palestinian people were "not bound" by the agreement, and Hamas 
would "continue struggling until all the occupiers leave the 
occupied territories." 
  Palestinians in Lebanon's largest refugee camp, 'Ayn 
al-Hulwah, set tyres ablaze and distributed leaflets denouncing 
'Arafat as a traitor. 
  The Cairo signing marked "the downfall of the traitor 
('Arafat) and we all know the fate of traitors," said the 
leaflets, signed by 10 Syrian-backed Palestinian groups. 
  Most of Lebanon's refugees came from areas that became part 
of Israeli territory in 1948 and were not included in the deal. 
  In Syria's biggest refugee camp, al-Yarmuk near Damascus, 
Bassam Raja, 35, asked "where is Palestine?" in the deal. 
  "'Arafat is just a paper president," he said. "I am a 
stateless man whose dreams of return have been shattered." 
  In Jordan, home to most of the Palestinian refugees after 
the 
1967 war, the opinions among Palestinians were less hostile but 
still marked by reservations. 
  "The deal is doomed to failure as it does not satisfy the 
Palestinian aspiration for an independent state," said officials 
in the al-Husayn camp in Amman, where 12,000 refugees live. 
  Amman newspapers however expressed hopes that the agreement 
would mark a new era in Arab history. 
  Al-Dustur said the deal was "a turning point for the 
Palestinians, who have paid a heavy price to recover their 
legitimate national rights." 
  However, in Damascus al-Ba'th, the newspaper of Syria's 
ruling party, condemned the deal, saying it "turns Gaza and 
Jericho into a Zionist protectorate." 
  Syria, which boycotted the signing ceremony in Cairo, says 
the agreement is a "separate deal" that violates Arab solidarity. 
  In Libya, the official news agency JANA said the agreement 
was "an illusion," and again called on Arabs to "destroy the 
imperialist and racist entity," a reference to Israel.

  [Excerpt] Gaza -- Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar has described the 
day of the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement as a 
black day for the Palestinian people and a day of mourning and 
grief to all those who love Jerusalem and Palestine and are 
aware of the nature of the conflict on this land. 
  In his statement to AL-QUDS, Dr. al-Zahhar stressed the 
Islamic Movement's rejection of the agreement that is expected 
to be signed today in Cairo between 'Arafat and Rabin. He said: 
History will not stop on this day or on any such event. Muslim 
history has proved that it has surmounted such days and that the 
journey of victory might be delayed but it is inevitable and 
certain. 
  Al-Zahhar added: Those signing the agreement will bear its 
results, consequences, and repercussions before God, the people, 
and history. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Since 1800 today, the Alliance of Palestinian Forces 
has been holding an expanded central meeting in the hall of 
martyr Samir Darwish at the building of the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] to study 
the current political situation, particularly the agreement 
'Arafat signed with terrorist Rabin in Cairo today in the 
presence of Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, the U.S. secretary 
of state, and the Russian foreign minister. 
  Before the meeting, PFLP-GC Secretary General Ahmad Jibril 
made a statement in which he said: Our people were not 
surprised by what they saw in Cairo when the detailed agreement 
was signed between 'Arafat and Rabin. What happened is an 
actual translation of the capitulatory deal 'Arafat accepted in 
Washington. He added: This is a day of sadness for our people 
and our Arab and Islamic nation. The agreement completely 
avoided mentioning Jerusalem, the capital of the Palestinian 
people, the first of the two qiblahs, and the third holiest 
mosque. He added that the agreement was also void of the right 
to repatriation and self-determination and did not mention the 
large-scale settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  Ahmad Jibril also said in his statement: The agreement was a 
total surrender by 'Arafat regarding the security file and the 
economic file. He said: Today, Our people staged a 
comprehensive strike in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in response 
to the agreement, pointing out that some parties, which support 
the agreement like Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi and Hanan 'Ashrawi 
announced that the agreement was a capitulatory one. 
  Ahmad Jibril also said: We, in the Alliance of the 
Palestinian Forces, are meeting to assess what happened because 
there are requirements now, practical requirements on the ground 
in Gaza and Jericho. He then pointed to statements made by 
terrorists Rabin and Peres on 'Arafat's upcoming duty to oppress 
the intifadah. Ahmad Jibril stressed that the Alliance of the 
Palestinian Forces will not create battles with the upcoming 
forces of oppression unless 'Arafat completely insists on 
clashing with the popular forces. He also asserted that the 
alliance will continue its jihad and militant program, and that 
time will prove that 'Arafat is unable to conquer the intifadah 
which will escalate. 
  Ahmad Jibril also pointed out that the agreement that 
'Arafat 
signed is much worse that the Camp David accords. He asserted 
that our people are aware of what happened in Cairo today. He 
added: We are determined to continue our plans and to deal with 
the collapse that 'Arafat and his supporters created. We say 
that the agreement is not bounding for the Palestinian people. 
Ahmad Jibril added that these agreements are null and that the 
future will show who is right. He said that this capitulatory 
agreement 'Arafat signed today will completely fail within three 
months. 
  In a similar statement, 'Imad al-'Alami, member of the 
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, said that the agreement is 
not binding for the Palestinian people, describing it as a 
poisoned dagger directed at the heart of the Arab and Islamic 
nation. He asserted that what happened today was not surprising 
and that the agreement is null and void and will not bind our 
people. He added that Palestine is not owned by those who sold 
themselves to the devil, including the 'Arafatist leadership, 
which disowned our people's revolution, struggle, and all the 
Islamic and Arab values. 
  Our people adhere to the firm principles of our Arab and 
Islamic nation in Palestine and to their full right to every 
inch of our land, Palestine. He said: We will not tire, and we 
are not pessimist. We are optimist because the people are 
steadfast and do not disown the martyrs' blood. Regarding the 
role of 'Arafat's police, 'Imad al-'Alami said that these police 
will not silence the sound of bullets which will continue as 
long as there is a usurped right in Palestine. The Alliance of 
the Palestinian Forces is still in session.

accord has also given up on these resolutions. 
  Needless to say, the economic accord recently signed in 
Paris 
which places not only Palestine, but also the entire Arab region 
and the Middle East [sentence incomplete as heard] and opens the

concerns you, I mean Iran. Why? Because this accord opens the

  [Text] Taysir Khalid, member of the Democratic Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] Political Bureau, has said 
that, by all standards, the agreement between Israel and the PLO 
is a capitulation agreement. In a statement today, Khalid said 
that the formula of the agreement and its supplements consecrate 
the isolation of Jerusalem from the occupied territories, 
suspend the Palestinian people's right to sovereignty over their 
territories, and give Israel the right to control crossing 
points, borders, and foreign security. 
  He said that the agreement was not presented to the PLO 
organizations, especially the Palestine National Council, which 
did not authorize the PLO Executive Committee to sign the 
agreement. He called on the Palestinian people to unite their 
ranks and continue resisting the occupation.

  [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[PFLP] said that signing the Israel-PLO agreements in Cairo and 
in Paris confirms Israel's success in circumventing the 
implementation of resolutions of international legitimacy, 
including UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. In a 
press statement today, the PFLP's official spokesman said that 
the signing of the agreements enables Israel to consecrate its 
occupation and illegal measures such as building settlements, 
confiscating territories, annexing and judaizing Jerusalem, and 
continuing economic hegemony over the occupied territories. 
  The PFLP spokesman said that the front is not obligated by 
the agreements reached and that it will continue to struggle 
until the Palestinian people's objectives are achieved. 
  The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] 
said that the Cairo agreement, which was signed today, brought 
to light all the misleading, cheating, and false claims on the 
nature of self rule in Gaza and Jericho. The DFLP explained 
that withdrawal has been replaced by redeployment, noting that 
the presence of settlements was legitimized by the fact that the 
Oslo team recognized these settlements and agreed to have their 
security protected by Palestinians. 
  In a statement distributed today, the DFLP said that the 
agreement opens the door to normalizing Arab-Israeli relations 
which threaten the fate of all Arab territories under occupation 
and the future of the Palestinian people. The statement adds: 
As the DFLP rejects the agreement and condemns those who signed 
it, it announces that the agreement is not binding to the 
Palestinian people and that it will continue its struggle to 
achieve the Palestinian people's right to liberate their 
territories from the occupation, to achieve self-determination, 
and to establish their independent state.

  [Text] Palestinian camps in Lebanon and Syria today 
observed a general strike to protest the signing of the 
self-rule agreement between the PLO and the Zionist enemy. 
  A popular demonstration was staged in the Palestinian camp 
'Ayn al-Hulwah in south Lebanon denouncing the agreement and 
describing the PLO leaders who signed it as traitors. 
  Munir al-Maqdah, a Fatah Movement dissident in the camp, 
said 
Yasir 'Arafat has fallen in the trap and that he is now just a 
political refugee entrusted with putting down the Palestinian 
intifadah against occupation.

<F P=106> [Bari'ah 'Alam-al-Din report: "Suha 'Arafat: I Am </F>
Boycotting Cairo Ceremony Because Palestinian Women Are Still in 
Prison"] 
  [Text] London -- Mrs. Suha 'Arafat has apologized for not 
responding to an invitation received from the Egyptian 
Government to attend the ceremony marking the signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement in Cairo today. She told AL-HAYAH 
that she has apologized to the Egyptian Government for being 
unable to accept the invitation, "despite her appreciation of 
the tireless efforts and assistance it offered to achieve 
progress in connection with the agreement." She attributed her 
failure to go to Cairo to "reasons related to her refusal to 
participate in any ceremonies or occasions of this kind while a 
large number of Palestinian women are still in Israeli jails." 
  Mrs. 'Arafat expressed her unwillingness to shake hands with 
or stand beside Mrs. Rabin, who will accompany her husband to 
the signing ceremony in Cairo today, before all Palestinian 
women are released from prison. 
  She said: "I support the president's decisions and stance. 
But I realize that the normalization process will need time. I 
do not believe that we will be able to normalize relations 
quickly amid this large number of psychological barriers which 
we should surmount." 
  She added: "A week ago the Israelis sentenced 'Abir Lahidi, 
a 20-year-old woman, to 20 years in prison. They also 
demolished her house, ignoring all talk about peace and the 
agreement. So how can I ignore or forget the suffering or 
feelings of Palestinian women held in prison, and appear in 
ceremonies before my people and the world?" 
  At another level, Mrs. 'Arafat said that she is going to 
accompany the Palestinian president to South Africa to 
congratulate President Nelson Mandela on his victory in the 
elections and to attend his inauguration ceremony.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin with </F>
foreign and domestic correspondents in Cairo -- live; passages 
within slantlines in English] 
  [Text] [Rabin] Good afternoon. As you well know, the 
first stage of the negotiations on the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles [DOP] ended today. The negotiations 
lasted seven months. This duration can be in part explained by 
the fact that we, naturally, wanted to reach a detailed 
agreement which would clarify in no uncertain terms the complex 
fabric of peaceful coexistence for two entities that -- as is 
well known -- have no love relationship, to put it mildly. This 
was done to implement the conceptual gist of the interim 
agreement. The interim agreement consists of two parts: giving 
the Palestinians authority to run their lives; and giving 
ourselves responsibility for Israel's external security, and 
defense of the settlements including settlers' movements within 
the territories. Gaza and Jericho is the first stage of the 
interim agreement. This was done to ascertain how the system 
functions, and it required dealing with numerous details. Today 
you were again made aware of the nature of the negotiations, 
their occasional deviations and repetitions. Therefore, I 
really regard the agreement and the accompanying maps as a basis 
that allows for the implementation of the concept's nucleus for 
the Palestinians to run their lives while we ensure the security 
of the State of Israel and its citizens. 
  Naturally, the key does not lie in the agreements alone, but 
also in their implementation. We are interested in relatively 
short implementation period. It became apparent to me last 
night that the PLO chairman is asking for several more weeks, 
two or three, for an overlapping period. We will probably have 
to agree to this, provided an overlap indeed takes place. I 
understand that today, 22 Palestinian policemen were supposed to 
begin manning the points and regions of coordination so that the 
policemen are received in an orderly manner. I hope that people 
will also be sent who are able to assume responsibility for 
running civilian life. I wish to point out: Today, in Gaza 
alone, 24,000 Palestinians receive their salary from the civil 
administration; 6,000 are permanent employees, and 18,000 are 
employed on a temporary basis to prevent the closure from 
causing economic distress that could create a security problem. 
The PLO has limited experience in running a community. There 
are people there who are able. I hope that the appropriate 
people arrive or are found in place, and indeed the handing over 
of the civilian and security issues is done properly. I mainly 
speak of the Gaza Strip, where some 750,000 Palestinians reside. 
In the entire Gaza region, there are more or less 16,000 
residents, which is naturally much smaller [sentence and figure 
as heard]. The territory of Gaza that would be handed over to 
the /Palestinian Authority/ does not include a single Israeli 
settlement. Therefore, the problems there are much simpler. 
  [Shlomo Raz, Qol Israel] Does the incident that took place 
on the stage during the signing ceremony not make you wonder 
about the ability to implement the agreement? Does it not make 
you regret the entire move? 
  [Rabin] There are no regrets, although during the past 
several months we learned that problems come up on occasion. 
Then, if we make our position unequivocally clear, we overcome 
the problems. 
  [Raz] Mr. Prime Minister, how do you intend to handle the 
negotiations with Syria following the agreement with the PLO? 
How much will this agreement influence the negotiations with 
Syria? 
  [Rabin] These are two separate negotiation tracks. The 
secretary of state visited our region. We raised several ideas. 
We received responses which, without exaggeration, revealed 
large gaps between our fundamental positions and theirs. 
Nevertheless, the secretary of state will probably return to 
our region in two weeks. If there is no change in the Syrian 
positions then a waiting period clearly lies ahead until their 
positions change because there are certain things that no 
Israeli Government can accept. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, can the 
principle of a certain area first also be applied on the Golan 
Heights? 
  [Rabin] I think that this constitutes an unsuccessful 
attempt to link today's very meaningful withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho first to something which is ultimately related to the 
last line of withdrawal [pauses] -- because as you know, this 
government has accepted the principle of territorial compromise 
and withdrawal -- certainly from part of the Golan Heights -- in 
exchange for peace. We also implemented a withdrawal in the 
case of Egypt without linking the issue to the last line of 
withdrawal from Egyptian territory. This is a different matter 
than Gaza and Jericho First. 
  [Imanu'el Rosen, Israel Television Channel 2] What would 
have 
happened had 'Arafat continued to refuse to sign the maps? 
  [Rabin] I think I made myself very clear to everyone there. 
I said that I would not make a speech and there would be no 
agreement. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, perhaps you 
can give us an authoritative explanation of what happened on the 
podium today? What was the cause of the misunderstanding? 
  [Rabin] I want to make something very clear. Perhaps the 
media overplayed reports that two central and dramatic issues 
were slated to be resolved in the meeting between 'Arafat and 
myself: the policeman on the bridge, and the expansion of the 
Jericho area. I think that in all truth -- not only because of 
us and perhaps mostly due to no fault of our own -- we devoted 
too much time to symbolic matters while the major problems of 
what would happen in the Gaza Strip where 750,000 Palestinians 
live in poverty; the problem of how to establish a system 
capable of maintaining public order and assuming its security 
responsibilities; the question of how to prepare for assuming 
control over the area.... [pauses]. As I mentioned earlier, 
the Civil Administration currently pays the salaries of 24,000 
wage earners in the Gaza Strip alone. Who will pay their 
salaries when we leave tomorrow or in one week? Who has made 
preparations to pay their salaries? Is there any institutional 
structure capable of assuming the responsibility? In the past I 
was firmly opposed to a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip. The reason was first and foremost that we would be 
blamed for the chaos, reciprocal killings, and other negative 
developments that could ensue if we implemented a rapid 
unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip without the presence 
of a party capable of assuming minimal security responsibilities 
-- and there is no such party. Who is capable of assuming 
minimal security responsibilities for the most immediate and 
vital necessities in the Gaza Strip? If we do not supply power 
there is no electricity in the Gaza Strip. If we do not supply 
it there is no water in the Gaza Strip. If we do not supply the 
hospitals with oxygen tanks then I do not know what would happen 
there. If we suddenly cut off the supply of medicine and drugs 
-- and there is no one there willing and capable of assuming 
responsibility -- then that might possibly obligate us today to 
drag out the process of our withdrawal from the Gaza Strip far 
longer than we would have wanted. Because our Palestinian 
partner was apparently busy with other things and less 
interested in sending people to the area to start overlapping in 
order to assume responsibility. Computers perhaps are the only 
field today in which some degree of overlap has taken place to 
some extent. That is the problem. 
  [Rabin] /As you are fully aware we signed today the 
agreement about Gaza-Jericho first, which is the first phase of 
the implementation of the DOP signed last September in 
Washington. I believe the minor incident that took place on the 
platform shows to you the difficulties that we experienced in 
the last over seven months of negotiations of the detailed 
implementation of the first phase -- the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
Why we stressed on preparing an agreement which all the details 
that we considered to be vital to its success must be worked 
out. We are trying here to create peaceful coexistence between 
two entities that there is no love lost between them -- and I 
put it mildly. The purpose is to create the kind of peaceful 
coexistence that on one hand the Palestinian authority will run 
the lives of the Palestinians in the agreed areas: the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. The main problem is in Jericho, it is 
750,000 Palestinians vis a vis 16,000 to 20,000 in the Jericho 
area [sentence as heard]. The economic difficulties are much 
bigger in the Gaza Strip. We want to maintain security. 
Security to the State of Israel -- that is to say external 
security. We agreed with the Palestinians in the DOP about 
having the settlements. Therefore, we are carrying the overall 
responsibility for the settlements in the territories, 
especially in the Gaza Strip -- in the Jericho area there are no 
Israeli settlements-- and of course, to their movement from the 
settlements to Israel or passing, like in Jericho, from the 
northern part into Jerusalem. We knew that unless everything 
will be prepared in detail there will be no chance to succeed to 
build this peaceful coexistence. 
  /Second, we found that much time was lost without 
overlapping 
activities on their part. It starts only today when 22 officers 
of their police will go there. We have to build and to create 
three centers of coordination: two in the Gaza Strip and one in 
Jericho, through which coordination between the Israeli military 
forces and the Palestinian police and other security activities 
will be coordinated otherwise the clashes can create a real 
problem. Therefore, we did not lose time. After all, we could 
complete the handing over from our own part in two, three weeks 
from today. It might be even in ten days. The problem today, 
as the chairman of the PLO said last night or deep in the night, 
is that he might demand little bit more: two, three even up to 
four weeks. We would like once we have reached agreement to get 
out as quickly as possible from wherever we have to get out. 
But we have an address, a capable address to hand over 
responsibility to the life of the Palestinians in the 
territories. Just to give you one example: We today pay to the 
Civil Administration under the military government of Israel in 
the Gaza Strip for 24,000 people. Six thousand permanent 
employees of the Civil Administration, for 18,000 a special 
budget was appropriated to prevent too high unemployment, the 
kind that would increase as a result of the closure on the 
territories. But we do not want the economic situation to 
develop in a way that it will create security risks for us. 
Tomorrow, we will leave. Who will pay these 24,000 people? 
[passage indistinct] 
  [Rabin, continues] /...from the outside, most of the people 
that have not been for 20 or 27 years in the Gaza Strip or in 
Jericho. How long will it take to acquaint themselves with the 
new changes in the area? Twenty seven years ago, when we 
entered during the Six-Day War to the Gaza Strip, there were 
less than 300,000 people there. Today it is three quarters of a 
million, if not 800,000. There are practical problems that, 
unfortunately, focus was not given enough in proper preparation 
for the handing over. We will have now to waste time, from our 
point of view, because for whatever we have agreed and for 
wherever we have agreed to pull out, we are ready to do it as 
quickly as possible. We will wait to see, today, tomorrow, the 
day after. Hopefully the infrastructure, the overlapping will 
be done in proper way. And we are committed toward what we 
signed today. We know that the partner is not accustomed to be 
responsible to life of community. It has limited experience in 
certain issues, but there are very capable Palestinians, and I 
believe there is no shortage of capable people there, if they 
have the determination and the guidance to what has been agreed 
on./ 
  [Unidentified correspondent] /Did Mr. 'Arafat tell you 
last night that he would not sign the map...? 
  [Rabin, interrupting] /I will explain what happened. 
Unfortunately, the media in the last three months built up two 
issues that would be decided in the meeting between Chairman 
'Arafat and myself: One is the Palestinian police on the 
bridge, one is the size of the Jericho area. Believe me, the 
two are symbols, for each side might be important, but this is 
not the crux of the problem that we face together in 
Gaza-Jericho alone. The issues that I referred to -- how to 
maintain the life of the Palestinians, to develop them 
economically, socially; the question of security -- these are 
the two issues that will decide the success or the failure of 
the attempt that we are engaged in. But the media built it, and 
I was limited by the principles that I was guided by them when 
we decided on Jericho in addition to Gaza -- that it will be a 
limited area; that it will not include any Israeli settlement, 
in contradiction to the Gaza Strip. Second, for me, security 
along the lines, external lines, it is to say that the external 
security interpretation, especially along the Jordan River, is 
an issue of great concern. Therefore I could not meet his 
expectations. He brought up another issue: Special 
arrangements in the Rafah terminal, and he demanded that there, 
the director general will be Palestinian. I could not meet 
this. [passage indistinct] 
  [Rabin continues] /...we signed the agreement on the basis 
of my position. It is to say: we added a certain amount of area 
to Jericho area as it was described before yesterday, and I 
agreed that we can continue the discussions on the issues but, 
when we sign, it will be on the basis of my answers. How it was 
ended? First I made it clear that unless the maps will not be 
signed there will be no agreement and I will not speak./ 
[passage indistinct] 
  [Rabin continues] /...I agreed that the discussions on these 
issues will be continued without affecting the implementation of 
the agreement -- based on what we know last night. I agreed to 
send a letter in which I will say that there will be continued 
discussions on these three issues./ 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Rabin] /I am sure that from the side of the Palestinians, 
it looks to a dramatic change in their lives. For the first 
time, the Palestinians will run large communities in what used 
to be British-mandated Palestine. From our point of view, the 
main test is security... [transmission interrupted] 
  [Rabin continues]/...we know that the issue of Jerusalem 
will be brought up in accordance to what we signed in the DOP. 
It is to say: Not later than two years after the completion of 
the implementation of Gaza-Jericho First. Jerusalem will not be 
discussed when we negotiate the second phase of the interim 
agreement, the elections, the final composition of the 
Palestinian authority, and the future of Judaea and Samaria. 
For me.... [break in reception] 
  [Rabin continues] /...some people did not believe Israel is 
serious in its readiness to go along with what we were committed 
to. But we, when we say, we mean it. Second, I believe that the 
question of the money was understood by us for a long time. 
This is why Israel's Foreign Minister Peres and others were 
active with the countries and organizations.../ [break in 
reception] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Indistinct question on the 
release of prisoners] 
  [Rabin] We have understandings and agreements regarding the 
release of prisoners, and we will follow them. I would not like 
to go into detail on this issue -- not here, not today. As for 
the Palestinian, PLO stand, regarding the shape of the permanent 
arrangement: You have their stand from the Madrid conference. 
They never kept it a secret. We have a different position. 
The most important thing now is to concentrate on the issues 
included in the DOP for the interim agreement. The first stage 
of the interim agreement is Gaza and Jericho First. Let us 
prove that we can create that which we have agreed on. Then we 
will talk about the end of it.

  [Text] Algiers, May. 03 (MAP) -- Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi 
said his cabinet is contemplating `with much hope' the 
establishment of a National Transition Council that will have a 
legislative task during the transition period. In an interview 
with Algerian news agency `APS' and daily 'AL-SHA'B', the 
Algerian prime minister said the council is an essential body 
with which the government will be in constant touch and to which 
it is planning to submit its projected program to get out of the 
current crisis in the country. 
  The National Transition Council which will be acting as a 
parliament during the three-year transition period will be made 
up of 280 members representing the state, political parties, and 
nonpolitical organizations. The institution of the council is 
to take place at the latest three months after the adoption of a 
transition platform. Several parties, mainly the former single 
party the National Liberation Front `FLN' and the Socialist 
Forces Front `FFS' have declined to be represented in the 
Council. Another group of some 30 political organizations said 
they are ready to sit in the Council. 
  In the same interview, the head of the Algerian Government 
said if conditions are met, elections which he described as 
`unavoidable' will be held before the expiry of the transition 
period. For the prime minister, the people have to choose those 
who will decide their future and conditions for the consultation 
have to be gathered. `We are ready from a technical and 
administrative viewpoint to hold elections', he pointed out. 
  Meanwhile, Algerian daily `L'INDEPENDANT, which reappeared 
on 
the newstand after a two week-ban, reported Tuesday that the 
curfew enforced in seven wilayas and extended later to three 
other central regions will be lifted next June. The paper, 
which quoted `reliable sources,' also cited measures to be taken 
by the government to support the civil peace process in the 
country. According to the daily, some leaders of the banned 
Islamic Salvation Front, including Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj 
will be `shortly released'.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "source" from the General People's </F>
Committee for Unity; place and date not given] 
  [Text] What is happening these days concerning what is 
known as the signing of an agreement between the 'Arafat group 
and the Israelis on limited self-rule in Gaza and Jericho is a 
form of falsification. The Arab Palestinian people have not been 
asked its view on this agreement, and therefore what has been 
signed is binding only to the signatories who have relinquished 
the inalienable and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, 
recognized by all the states of the world through international 
resolutions adopted at the United Nations, resolutions that 
affirm the national legitimate rights of the Palestinian people 
to all its land. 
  This insignificant signing is a unilateral solution that 
gives the Israelis rights to what does not belong to them. It 
expresses the submission of some Palestinian leaders to the 
American-Zionist conspiracy aimed at fragmenting the Arab nation 
and enabling the Zionist enemy, by force, to control the Arab 
homeland, so that the Israelis may become the foundation of a 
Middle East order due to their military might and their weapons 
of mass destruction that come under no international control. 
  In addition, the crusading west, which bears rancor against 
the Arab nation and Muslims, continues to supply the Israelis 
with the most modern means of destruction, the last of which was 
the deal on American strategic bomber jets, which can cover the 
distance from Pakistan in the east to Morocco in the west. 
Moreover, the Israelis continue their occupation of the Arab 
lands from Egypt's Umm al-Rashrash [Eilat] to the Syrian Golan 
Heights and southern Lebanon. 
  The position of the Arab nation is firm concerning a just 
and 
comprehensive peace, which comes down to the return to their 
countries of origin of the Jews which emigrated to Palestine 
while fleeing persecution, the return of the Palestinian people 
to their own land, and establishing a Palestinian democratic 
state on all the territory of Palestine. This solution is the 
one that guarantees peace in the region, and spares the Jews the 
danger of extermination which the west is seeking to secure 
against them. 
  The emergence of what is called Israel after World War II, 
as 
a result of this war, must be removed, similar to the other 
arrangements, such as the Berlin Wall and the problem of the 
people of South Africa.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin called on all 
supporters of the government's policy not to pay heed to those 
who rejoiced over spilled blood. The bloodshed was not 
attributable to the peace process but rather the result of false 
messianic beliefs and the hostility of the other side. The 
prime minister was speaking at a mass rally in Tel Aviv a short 
while after his return from Cairo. 
  Rabin called on his supporters to show more spirit and tell 
the enemies of peace in Israel that they did not represent the 
public. The Israeli people want peace and we will achieve it, 
Yitzhaq Rabin asserted.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- The Lower House of Parliament on Wednesday 
[4 May] cut short a regular session at the request of 31 
deputies who demanded the House condemn and protest the 
"humiliation" of the self-rule deal signed in Cairo between 
Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) 
  It is not acceptable that the House discuss the draft sales 
tax law "on this black day, the day of the sale of Palestine," 
said the deputies in a signed statement, demanding that the 
House hold a special meeting to discuss the agreement and 
condemn the "Cairo agreement of humiliation." 
  But the meeting ended in disarray after most deputies walked 
out before a special committee assigned with drafting a 
statement on the issue finished its work. The House did not 
adopt the statement draft by the committee and it was considered 
to reflect the views of only those who signed it. 
  About 20 deputies signed the statement despite efforts by 
Islamic Action Front (IAF) deputies who chased their fellow 
parliamentarians across the corridors of Palriament to get their 
signatures. House Speaker Tahir al-Masri did not sign, which 
condemns the agreement as a "deviation from the commitment to a 
comprehensive solution and a subjugation to Zionists and 
American pressures." 
  The statement also said Jordan, which "did not give up Arab 
rights despite the pressures and temptations, is not responsible 
for the concessions (in the Cairo) Agreement." 
  The IAF deputies, however, criticized the government for 
attending the signing ceremony of the self-rule accord because 
that made it "a witness to the sale of Palestine." 
  "We condemn the agreement and we condemn those who attended 
the signing ceremony," IAF spokesman Hamzah Masur told the 
JORDAN TIMES. 
  Mr. Mansur expressed the IAF's disappointment with the 
reported change in the government's position regarding attending 
the signing ceremony, saying "we were saddened by the change." 
  But Deputy 'Abd al-Karim al-Kabiriti said: "No one can 
outbid the Jordanian position (on the Palestinian issue) which 
was manifest in His Majesty King Husayn's recent speech during 
the celebrations of the completion of the restoration work on 
the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem." 
  Mr. al-Kabariti said the Jordanian position is in harmony 
with that of the Jordanian people and the Kingdom's 
participation in the peace talks was part of a national strategy 
stemming from the fact that "we have to negotiate so that we 
will be players and not a playing field." 
  Deputy Tujan Faysal attributed the failure of the House to 
adopt the statement condemning the Cairo accord to the 
unwillingness of some deputies to "anger the government, the 
United States, Egypt or even (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzaq) 
Rabin," but other deputies saw in Mrs. Faysal's statement a 
distortion of the stand of the House. 
  Most of the 20 deputies who spoke during the meeting were 
opposed to the agreement and no one has the right to question 
the position of the lawmakers, said Deputy 'Abd al-Ra'uf 
al-Rawabdah in reaction to Mrs. Faysal's statement. 
  Parliamentary sources said most of the deputies walked out 
of 
the meeting in protest against giving the floor to IAF deputies 
and other opponents of the agreement while others were excluded. 
  While some lawmakers said the House failed to adopt the 
statement due "to outside pressure," others said that the 
self-rule agreement is a Palestinian affair signed by the 
representative of the Palestinian people and hence their refusal 
to sign the statement condemning it. 
  Mr. al-Kabariti stressed the urgency of formulating a 
national strategy to counter the negative economic impact of the 
agreement on Jordan, reiterating rejection of partial deals that 
could threaten "our economy and our national unity." 
  Other lawmakers said the "PLO has burnt its bridges with the 
Palestinians of the diaspora and become subordinate to Israel" 
by signing the self-rule accord. They echoed Mr. al-Kabariti in 
saying lawmakers should focus on the impact of the accord on the 
interests of Jordan. 
  The House, which cannot discuss the issue during its current 
sessions because it is constitutionally restricted to the items 
on the agenda during extraordinary sessions, will hold another 
meeting today to further discuss whether it will adopt the 
statement condemning the accord. 
  Islamic Action Front deputies told the JORDAN TIMES they 
would try to get the signatures of more than half the members of 
the legislature on the statement so that it becomes an official 
document of the House. 
  But Parliamentary sources expected the IAF to fail in its 
bid 
because most of the deputies who walked out on Wednesday's 
meeting has taken a decision not to show up for Thursday's 
meeting "in continuation of their protest against not being 
given the chance to speak."

  [Text] Tehran, May 5, IRNA-- A Persian daily here Thursday 
blasted the Wednesday's signing of final documents on 
Gaza-Jericho compromise deal between Yasir 'Arafat and the 
Zionist regime and termed it as complete surrender to the 
Zionist enemy. The morning Persian daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' 
said in its editorial that the entire occupied territories 
plunged into strike and protest against the treacherous measure. 
The agreement is so scandalous that even 'Arafat primarily 
refused to sign its map appendix but eventually he was forced to 
do so under the U.S. pressures, the daily said. 
  Although the Zionist enemy and its supporters intend to 
suppress and uproot the Palestine Islamic movement through their 
bullying methods, they should realize that 'Arafat is not the 
representative of the Palestinian nation. 
  Lashing out at some of the reactionary Arab regimes for 
their 
collective treachery, it said that such regimes are not the 
guardians of the Palestinian nation. The daily added that the 
Palestinians have shown through their active presence in the 
occupied territories that they will not give in to such bullying 
acts. The paper stressed that the intifadah, the all-out 
uprising of the Palestinian nation, will have the final word in 
the occupied territories, adding that, the final word is the 
elimination of the occupying regime of Qods [Jerusalem]. 
  Liberation of the occupied territories and annihilation of 
the usurpers is the only option before the Palestinian nation, 
concluded the paper.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir </F>
'Arafat by Faridah al-Shubashi in Cairo on 4 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Shubashi] Mr. President, on this day and after 
listening to your speech this morning, what do you have to say 
to your people in the occupied Palestinian territories, those 
who are optimistic or those who are pessimistic about the 
agreement? 
  ['Arafat] The first thing I would like to emphasize is that 
our people are optimistic, our people, the people who forge 
miracles, the people of martyrs, the people of sacrifices, the 
people against whom the conspiracy has been since the turn of 
the century until now [words indistinct] different opinions. 
However, I do not believe that there are pessimists among our 
people. This is the people [words indistinct] the Koran 
describes by saying: In this land are a people of exceeding 
strength [Koranic verse] 
  [Al-Shubashi] Mr. President, are you optimistic about the 
scope of the Palestinian state, God willing? 
  ['Arafat] [Words indistinct] the Palestinian people have 
actively contributed to building many of the Arab countries. 
They have contributed to Arab civilization and have largely 
contributed with their blood, spirit, ideas, muscles, 
experience, aspirations and [word indistinct] in all the Arab 
walks of life. I am confident [words indistinct] soon and very 
soon. Today, we laid the corner stone for the edifice of this 
Palestinian state. They see it as something far off, and we see 
it as something near [word indistinct]. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Mr. President, thank you.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Faysal al-Husayni by Roni </F>
Shaqed in Jerusalem on 3 May] 
  [Text] "We are giving birth to a baby today, but it is 
weak. I love him because he is my child, but I am not pleased," 
Faysal al-Husayni, who laid the foundations for the peace accord 
yet was left behind in Jerusalem today, said. Like other 
Palestinian leaders in the territories, he will watch the 
signing ceremony on television. 
  "This is the first step toward a Palestinian state. I would 
have liked the first step to have been bigger, but it is a 
start," al-Husayni told YEDI'OT AHARONOT. "I thought we would 
be able to rule in Gaza and Jericho and tell the Israeli people: 
Yes, we can be free, build our country, and provide security 
for our people and yours. It now appears that we are not really 
being allowed to rule. Details introduced into the agreement 
take this opportunity away from the Palestinian people. If I 
must provide security, I require full control. 
  "The future of Jerusalem also troubles me. The closure harms 
religious life, and family ties are disrupted. We do not want a 
new agreement, but we are demanding a return to the previous 
situation in Jerusalem. I spoke with 'Arafat on the matter and 
asked him to raise the closure issue in his meeting with Rabin." 
  I asked him: We spoke in 1988, and you said that one day a 
Palestinian state would be set up. Did you think this would be 
the path taken? 
  "I thought that the process would take much longer. I spoke 
of 20 years; I thought demography would change the face of 
things." 
  How will we promote relations ties now? 
  "We have to change the Israeli mentality, and our side must 
see you differently as well. We have to believe in peace."

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, today received Djibouti 
Prime Minister Barkat Hamadou, who conveyed to him a letter from 
his brother Djibouti President Hassan Gouled. The letter dealt 
with bilateral relations, issues of interest to both fraternal 
countries, and developments in our country. 
  The letter stressed Djibouti's concern for stability in our 
country and its support of Yemen's unity and democratic policy 
as well as Djibouti's readiness to make any efforts or offer any 
good offices to help our country circumvent the challenges 
imposed by the crisis. The letter pointed out that Yemen's 
security and stability are of concern to Djibouti and other 
regional states, led by the Horn of Africa states. 
  The brother chairman of the Presidential Council voiced 
great 
appreciation for the genuine fraternal sentiments and the 
concern for supporting Yemeni unity, which is a pan-Arab gain 
for all sons of the Arab nation. He said our country cannot do 
without the efforts of any of its brethren, including those in 
Djibouti. The brother chairman pointed to the special 
Yemeni-Djibouti relations, which are close and historic ones. 
  The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that the brother 
chairman asked the Djibouti prime minister to convey a reply 
message to his brother President Hassan Gouled. He wished 
Yemeni-Djibouti relations further progress and prosperity. The 
meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
al-Anisi, Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, and 
Djibouti Charge d'affires in Sanaa (Yusuf Omar Da'alah).

  [Text] The House of Representatives met this morning in a 
session chaired by Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. 
The house reviewed and approved the minutes of the previous 
session. The people's representatives resumed their discussions 
of the contents of the report of the House of Representatives' 
committee in charge of investigating the incidents in the 'Imran 
region. 
  During the discussions, the representatives stressed that it 
is important for the House of Representatives to adopt a serious 
and responsible position on developments in the country. This 
is because the current situation requires the House to issue 
sound decisions that are free of leniency and placation. It was 
stressed that the Armed and Security Forces should stand 
alongside Constitutional legitimacy, seek to spare Yemeni blood, 
withdraw military forces and units stationed in what used to be 
called the border areas before unity between North and South 
Yemen was established, and transfer these units so they can 
undertake the duties of defending national sovereignty and 
protecting vital targets. 
  The people's representatives applauded the appeal issued by 
the chairmanship of the House of Representatives on 3 May to all 
personnel, noncommissioned officers, and officers of the Armed 
and Security Forces throughout all camps and positions in the 
Republic of Yemen. In the statement, the chairmanship noted the 
need to show wisdom and self-restraint and to reject any 
conspiracy calling for infighting. 
  The session lasted for four hours. The House of 
Representatives will resume its session tomorrow morning.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers held its periodic session 
this morning under Muhammad Sa'id al-Attar, deputy prime 
minister, the minister of industry, and head of the General 
Investment Authority. 
  At the outset of the session, the council recited the 
opening 
verses of the Koran for the souls of the martyrs of the 
incidents in 'Imran, including First Deputy Prime Minister Dr. 
Hasan Makki's bodyguard. 
  The council discussed the wicked attack on Dr. Hasan Makki. 
It stressed that the concerned quarters should follow the issue 
and arrest the rest of the perpetrators and those who cover for 
them and bring all of them to trial. 
  Moreover, the council decided to offer full legal care for 
the families of the three heroic martyrs who were guarding Dr. 
Makki and to grant the families of those martyrs medals, rank, 
and appropriate compensation. 
  The Council of Ministers also reviewed a report on the 
meeting held by the ministerial committee in charge of following 
up and facilitating the work of the Military Committee formed by 
the Council of Ministers and headed by the minister of defense. 
The Military Committee was delegated to draw a plan to move the 
military forces from what used to be called the border areas 
prior to unity between the north and the south in implementation 
of the first part of the accord document. It was supposed to 
present this plan during this session. The council agreed to 
continue with the previous [word indistinct] and to have the 
Military Committee present a detailed report on the results of 
its actions. 
  The council also decided to amend the bill on weight loads 
presented by the Roads and Bridges General Authority. The 
council also reviewed a report by the Ministry of Health on the 
efforts exerted by the ministry to save and treat the victims of 
the regrettable incidents in 'Imran.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has 
denied a report on 3 May from the REUTER news agency citing a 
responsible military source that the northern Yemeni forces shot 
down a southern Yemeni Mig-21 fighter aircraft. The responsible 
source said the report was totally untrue. 
  The source also rejected the report of the television's 
first 
channel yesterday evening quoting a military spokesman of the 
Defense Ministry and the leadership of the General Staff of the 
movement of the 'Abbas, Taysir, and Milhim Brigades toward the 
former border areas in Shabwah. The source said this report was 
not only completely untrue but was aimed at obfuscating the 
continuing military reinforcements of the forces of the ruling 
family in Sanaa, being provocatively sent to the former border 
and toward the military units transferred from the southern to 
the northern governorates after unity, in accordance with the 
design to pounce on unity and democracy by attacking the active 
and generous forces standing in the way of the adventurist 
al-Ahmar family's plan to impose military rule.

  [Text] Sanaa, 4 May (MENA) -- Fighting broke out tonight in 
the city of Dhamar, 100 km south of Sanaa, between the 
Republican Guard forces (northern) and the garrison of the 
Basahib camp (southern). 
  An official source at the Yemeni Socialist party [YSP] in 
Dhamar said that, at about 1930, the Republican Guard Forces 
attacked the Basahib camp with missiles, artillery, and tanks. 
Clashes are still taking place in front of the camp with all 
types of weapons. An electricity station was shelled and the 
camp's munitions and fuel depots were burned, according to the 
source. 
  Meanwhile, a responsible source at the General People's 
Congress in Sanaa said that the YSP forces in Dhamar fired at 
Republican Guard camps and that no information is yet available. 
  Power cuts have taken place in most parts of Sanaa since 
2030 
tonight.

<F P=106> [Statement by "source" at the Ministry of Defense and the </F>
General Staff Command on the "reckless and adventurous acts 
carried out by those who call for secession and apostasy in the 
cities of Dhamar and Aden yesterday;" date and place not 
given--read by announcer] 
  [Text] O sons of our proud Yemeni people, o heroes in the 
valiant armed and security forces: The forces of apostasy, 
secession, treachery, and treason are fiercely revealing their 
rancor and conspiratorial acts against both the homeland's fate 
and the people's life and achievements by inflaming a 
comprehensive war targeting the pioneering national 
establishment, namely, the armed and security forces, with the 
aim of turning both their destruction and the blood of their 
sons into a bridge which these forces would cross en route to 
their lowly and treacherous ambitions and also en route to the 
ambitions of their masters, who are waylaying the homeland's 
unity, democracy, pride, and dignity. 
  These forces have ignited an infernal fire wherever they 
can. 
Their hegemony went to the point of issuing the utmost 
instructions they could give. However, this bridge soon 
collapsed at the hands of those who chose the trench of 
defending the homeland, the revolution, unity, and the new life 
in the Yemen of 22 May. These are the faithful men among the 
sons of our people and among their valiant Armed Forces, who 
fulfilled their pledge to God and valiantly sacrificed 
themselves, so unity would remain brilliant in the homeland, and 
so democracy would illuminate the darkness of the totalitarian 
and dictatorial one-party system, and so the people would have 
the final say because it is derived from God's sayings, and so 
the dreams of devils would be shattered. These devils sold 
themselves, their fate, and everything that is dear and sacred 
in the market of ill wagers, in the face of the will of life, of 
maintaining democracy, and of raising high the flags of the 
Republic of Yemen. 
  To these heroes of our Armed Forces, we say: May you rejoice 
in the new chapter of pride and glory you are writing everywhere 
as a great victory. May you rejoice in the homeland and unity. 
To all those who fell victim to their disease and rancor, we 
say: History is pouring on you the dust of shame and disgrace, 
exactly as it poured dust on similar traitors and agents. 
History is also closing the doors to what you planned and to 
what your minds and acts sought to achieve. You may face a dark 
and bad fate. 
  We tell the deceived ones whose loyalty is still to God, 
the homeland, and the revolution, and who offered dear 
sacrifices to protect the achievements of the September and 
October revolutions: Disregard the instructions of the 
murderers and executioners and the advocates of secession. Join 
the honorable trench, the trench of all valiant men and the 
trench of protecting legitimacy and preserving unity and 
democracy. This is our inevitable path to achieve all 
aspirations and hopes. It is our path to heal the wounds of the 
hearts through the beginning of a new life, in which there is no 
room for crises and fabricators of crises or those who tried to 
take dirty money to foil unity and democracy by fabricating 
crises and igniting the crime of war and fratricide among the 
children of the one Yemeni homeland. 
  We also hail the brave heroes in the army of the revolution, 
unity, and democracy who are now foiling the conspiracy of 
secession and raising high the banners of unity. We also hail 
all officers, NCO's, and soldiers who refused to fall in the 
quagmire of the conspiracy against unity and democracy and 
proved that they have cleansed themselves of the filth of the 
era of the class vindictiveness and the dictatorship of the one 
party and sided with the people, unity, and constitutional 
legitimacy. We stress to the people and history that the crime 
of the ugly war ignited by the malicious persons in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, particularly traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his 
secessionist gang, has clearly exposed the nature of the enemies 
of the people, revolution, unity, and democracy. 
  The chance is now available once again to all heroes in our 
Armed Forces and security agencies in Sa'dah, al-Mahrah, 
Hadhramaut, Ta'izz, and all parts of the united homeland to join 
the ranks of all those who hold unity dear in their hearts. 
They now have the chance to prove once again -- with valor, 
heroism, and with their warm, pure blood -- that they can defend 
the most hallowed value of the people, and to confirm their 
readiness to offer the dearest sacrifices to ensure that this 
homeland will remain united and its will unbreakable. They have 
the chance to confirm the people's democratic choice, upon which 
the enemies of the people tried to encroach through all devious 
means for the sake of filthy money and a mad attachment to power. 
  Here they are today digging their own graves so that they 
will not remain a source of shame for the homeland and a heavy 
burden on the new Yemeni life; so that our people will not live 
again in the eras of suppression, terrorism, and bloodbaths, and 
the rule of terrorism, suppression, and mass murders of the 
cream of the Yemeni society; and so that the future of the 
people and country will not be controlled by that gang of 
tyrants, murderers, thieves, and criminals, and the madmen of 
the blind, vindictive theories and false slogans, which will 
only bring to the people death and suppression and to the 
homeland fire, destruction, and damage, which they wanted to 
afflict on everything beautiful in it.

<F P=106> [Unscheduled announcement on statement by "military source" </F>
at the Defense Ministry and General Staff Command] 
  [Text] The forces of apostasy and secession in the 
Socialist Party leadership are continuing their spiteful, 
aggressive operations against the Armed Forces and Security 
units as well as the citizens, the sons of our people, using all 
types of ground and air weapons. 
  At 0530 [0230 GMT] today, two aircraft belonging to the 
secessionist gang, which is rebelling against the Constitutional 
legitimacy, launched air raids on the capital, Sanaa, aiming at 
vital targets. The antiaircraft defenses intercepted the 
raiding aircraft and forced them to flee. In the meantime, the 
gang, which is rebelling against the Constitutional legitimacy 
sent some aircraft to strafe the al-Hudaydah and Ta'izz 
airports. The ground defenses forced them to flee without 
hitting their targets. 
  The forces of that rebelling gang are continuing their 
criminal aggression in more than one place in the homeland 
against the sons of our brave Armed Forces. These criminal 
forces will reap nothing but loss and defeat, God wiling, so 
that the Yemeni homeland will continue to be united and 
prosperous.

  [Text] Sanaa, 5 May (AFP) -- Heavy anti-aircraft fire broke 
out here Thursday as at least two southern Yemeni warplanes flew 
low over the city, and one of the aircraft may have been brought 
down, witnesses said. 
  The firing from the rival northern Yemeni guns lit up the 
pre-dawn sky for 45 minutes and a large cloud of smoke billowed 
into the air, they added. 
  Army vehicles criss-crossed the city and Westerners were 
advised to stay at home. 
  A US special envoy, Robert Pelletreau, arrived Wednesday to 
try to defuse the crisis which is pitting forces from the former 
North Yemen, loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, against 
those from the old South Yemen, who back Vice-President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. 
  The two have been at loggerheads for months and the dispute 
is threatening to degenerate into a civil war which could split 
the country only four years after they united. 
  Clashes between rival army units broke out late Wednesday at 
Dhamar, south of the capital Sanaa, and in the main southern 
city Aden. 
  Northern radio broadcast an urgent message saying "we have 
done all we could to bring the southerners to their senses and 
now we must rely on our heroic forces." 
  Electricity has been cut off in most parts of Sanaa since 
Wednesday when the fighting broke out in Dhamar, which provides 
much of the capital's power. 
  There was also fighting around Aden airport. 
  Battles last week officially cost 79 lives, although 
independent sources put the death toll at more than 200.

  [Text] Sanaa, 4 May (MENA) -- A military source at the 
Ministry of Defense in Sanaa has stated that President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih has issued orders to the Defense Ministry and 
the General Staff to stop the fighting that broke out earlier in 
Dhamar, south of Sanaa. He also asked the commander of the 
Republican Guard Battalion, northern, to halt the fighting 
unilaterally. 
  The source accused the Basahib Camp forces, southern, of 
starting the fighting this evening and charged that influential 
forces in the Yemeni Socialist Party are embarked on a plan to 
divide Yemen. 
  The source accused the same parties of attacking the Central 
Security personnel in Aden this evening and encircling and 
shelling their camps with tank artillery.

  [Text] Sanaa, May 5 (AFP)--Southern warplanes attacked the 
government headquarters and the radio and television centre here 
Thursday, an AFP correspondent reported. 
  Anti-aircraft guns blazed into action and it was not 
immediately known if the planes hit their targets, the 
correspondent added. 
  Witnesses also reported that a southern aircraft may have 
been shot down over Sanaa just before dawn. 
  Airports in the towns of Ta'izz in the south and in 
al-Hudaydah in the west also came under attack Thursday from 
southern planes but were not hit, the defence ministry said in a 
statement. 
  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared a 30-day state of 
emergency following the worsening fighting between his 
supporters from the north and their southern rivals. 
  Troops were deployed in the deserted streets as army 
vehicles 
criss-crossed the city.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we have received the following: 
  The House of Representatives held a session this morning 
under its Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar to 
discuss the latest military developments in the country. The 
House called on all the masses of the Yemeni people to stand by 
Constitutional legitimacy and rally around the legitimate 
political leadership under brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and 
supreme commander of the Armed Forces. The House also called on 
all officers, noncommissioned officers, and personnel of the 
Armed and Security Forces in the Republic of Yemen to rally 
around the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces and not to obey 
orders unless they are issued by the supreme commander of the 
Armed Forces. 
  The House also decided to withdraw confidence in the 
secessionist elements in the leadership of the [Yemeni] 
Socialist Party [YSP] for their persistent wrongdoing which 
reached the extent of raiding the capital Sanaa and the two 
cities of Ta'izz and al-Hudaydah with aircraft and frightening 
the inhabitants and disturbing sleeping children. The House of 
Representatives also ratified the declaration of a state of 
emergency and authorized the political leadership to issue the 
necessary decisions to deal with the situation through which the 
country is passing. The people's deputies also decided to keep 
the House in open session. 
  The House has earlier reviewed and ratified the minutes of 
its previous session.

  [Text] An official source at the Yemeni Foreign Ministry 
has welcomed the statement the U.S. State Department issued 
yesterday evening on the current developments in our country. 
The source noted the statement's emphasis on the importance of 
convening the Constitutional institutions and the return of the 
official leadership to Sanaa in order to work as one team. He 
also noted the statement's call for disengaging the units and 
refraining from the use of force. 
  The official source expressed Yemen's appreciation of the 
American interest in preserving unity, democracy, security, and 
stability in our country and in the need to be guided by 
Constitutional legitimacy. The source said the American 
statement goes in the direction of what the legitimate and 
Constitutional leadership in the Republic of Yemen is proposing 
on the need to resolve the political crisis by peaceful means 
and within the framework of the pledge and accord document 
unanimously endorsed by the Yemeni people.

assuredly be the first sector to replace oil. 
  The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Shoja', deputy from Bandar-e Enzeli. During his 
speech he offered congratulations and felicitations on the 
anniversary of the Islamic revolution of Iran and the blessed 
month of Ramazan. He added: Today America, as the leader of the 
world's domineering nations, through the use of the measures it 
has devised and promoted in the Security Council, considers the 
United Nations to be its agent in creating the world's cultural, 
economic, and military policy in the new world order. Through 
the use of military tools and implements, it is thinking of 
changing the geographic borders of nations and controlling the 
world's strategic economic points, such as the oil-rich Persian 
Gulf sheikhdoms, which submit to domination. 
  The speaker discussed the fact that America, despite its 
claim to world leadership, is one of the world's most accursed 
and vulnerable nations. He said: Economically, America is now 
one of the world's most indebted nations, and is considered one 
of the most insecure nations socially. The Islamic Republic of 
Iran, despite 15 years of tricks by world imperialism, through 
reliance on just Islamic government with the backing of its 
great people, is in full control of all its current affairs and 
its First and Second Five-Year Plans. Today it is one of the 
most secure nations in the region and in the world in terms of 
political, cultural, and economic independence. 
  Continuing, he said: Proper and committed Islamic 
management, 
serious supervision and control of executive affairs, timely and 
appropriate encouragement, the exposure of cultural and economic 
criminals, and dealing with them in an effective and 
revolutionary way can be the basic factors in achieving full 
independence for the government. 
  Careful supervision and attention to the nation's potential 
resources can bring us closer to cultural independence without 
dependence on foreign specialists, with a minimum of foreign 
exchange. An example is the agricultural sector. A look it its 
performance tables under the First Five-Year Plan will confirm 
to government officials that if more attention is given to this 
sector, it will assuredly be the first sector to replace oil 
with agricultural and livestock exports, and it will provide all 
the nation's domestic needs. 
  During his speech, the deputy from Bandar-e Enzeli discussed 
the fact that the nation's forests and pastures are being 
destroyed and that in previous years we had floods and heavy 
losses because of the lack of plant cover in the vicinity of the 
nation's cities and villages. 
  He called on officials to create suitable work environments 
and to employ sincere and specialist manpower along with real 
planning in order to be able to take basic and useful steps to 
save the nation's natural resources. 
  He also criticized the dysfunctional situation with 
fisheries 
and fishermen in the northern part of the country in the Caspian 
Sea. He said: Another problem in the area arises from the lack 
of real and timely policymaking by officials of the Iran 
Fisheries Organization, idle fishermen, and the excessive waste 
of time for the region's Majles deputies and officials. Today, 
in view of the shared use of the fish in the Caspian Sea by five 
nations on its shores, waiting for fish in a launch cannot 
answer the economic needs of the fishermen in the northern part 
of the country. 
  Shoja' also said: The phenomenon of the rising waters of the 
Caspian Sea in the last few years and the lack of persistent and 
timely action on the part of the appropriate officials has 
brought heavy losses to the people. Unfortunately, real steps 
were not taken by the Plan and Budget Organization to provide 
emergency government assistance, and this in itself calls for 
serious questions and memos to the officials in charge. I, 
therefore, request that quick attention be given to this 
important matter. 
  The speaker discussed the liberation of the newly 
independent 
Central Asian nations, most of which are Muslim and can be in 
close contact with Iran via the Caspian Sea. He said: Until now, 
with the passage of several years, free trade has not taken 
place between Iran and the other nations of the shores of the 
Caspian Sea, and this in itself is considered a turning point in 
trade and the spread of Islamic culture. Unfortunately, the 
European nations, seeking to dominate the culture and economy of 
the nations of the region, went into these countries more 
quickly than we did and have made the most of them culturally 
and economically. 
  At the end of his speech he asked the respected president of 
the republic to give special attention to opening Bandar-e 
Enzeli, this old port in the north, to free trade with the 
nations of Central Asia. 
<H5>  'Ali Kamyar, Deputy From Urmia </H5>
  The Majles and the government must discuss economic 
realities 
with the people, and not keep saying that our situation is good. 
  The next speaker was Kamyar, deputy from Urmia. He thanked 
the exalted leader for appointing a new chief of the Voice and 
Vision organization. He said: His excellency has repeatedly 
demonstrated that His Holiness, like the late Imam, considers 
the Majles to be at the head of affairs and that he gives 
special standing to the views of the Majles. 
  He then discussed the economic changes in society. He said: 
The topic of the day in our country is the price of foreign 
exchange, and everyone is analyzing the government's decisions 
on this matter. However, an important point on which everyone 
must focus is the failure to deal seriously with the economic 
problems. 
  While we believe that world imperialism suffered the 
greatest 
damage with the establishment of the sacred Islamic government, 
we must accept the fact that in response it will direct the 
greatest pressure and aggression at us. 
  We all know that since the imposed war, by their own 
admission they have been unable to deal with great Iran. Since 
that time they have made a serious and firm decision to fight us 
culturally, politically, and economically. It is appropriate to 
understand the imperialist positions in this regard with 
sufficient care. Their goals must be analyzed and we must resist 
them as necessary. 
  He said that we must assess our strengths and weaknesses. He 
said: The exalted leader sounded the alarm in the cultural 
dimension two years ago, when he declared a general mobilization 
against the cultural invasion, and everyone has at least 
recognized this as an important danger. 
  The speaker continued: It must be accepted that our economic 
situation today is the result of the failure to deal seriously 
with economic issues. We have spoken about attention to 
production, but we have been satisfied with talk. We have spoken 
about low consumption, but in practice we faced growth in 
consumption. We have spoken about agricultural growth, but every 
day we witness agricultural malfunctions. We have spoken of the 
need for nondependence on oil, but in practice we have done 
nothing. We have repeated slogans about domestic goods, but our 
markets are full of foreign goods. How effective have we been 
reaching our goals to fight rural emigration, the growth in 
unemployment and high prices that keep rising every day? We must 
realize that the drop in the price of oil is the result of 
several years of world imperialist policy, for which they 
invested year after year with no other aim but to damage Islamic 
Iran. 
  The speaker explained: If we wait too long to move, if we do 
not awaken soon, if we do not make a serious decision to fight 
back, criminal America will achieve the next in its series of 
goals, which is to make us indifferent towards the sacred 
principles of our Islamic government. 
  The Majles and the government must discuss economic 
realities 
with the people, and not keep saying that our situation is good. 
Yes, our situation on the political issues is good, but on the 
economic issues our situation is nothing to brag about. It is 
true that we are in a better situation than our neighboring 
countries, but this is not enough. Their situation is not 
comparable to ours. We are independent and we must remain truly 
independent. We must evaluate our own specific circumstances. 
  Continuing his remarks, the deputy from Urmia noted: Why 
should we not tell the people that our nation's income is not as 
high as our consumption? The nation's income is not enough to 
meet its heavy expenses. You must realize that the nation's oil 
revenues are several times less than they were 15 years ago, and 
on the other hand our expenses are several times greater. Our 
great nation must realize that the front line in our religious 
crusade is now the battle against economic plots. They must 
realize that the rise in the price of foreign exchange is not in 
any way the desire of the government, and that the government 
itself suffers the most from this. 
  The growth in the price of the dollar depends on the demand 
for it. If we decrease our own need for foreign exchange, the 
price of foreign exchange will automatically go down. We are 
proud that in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] we 
imported $28 billion in goods. You must look at the statistics 
and see what percentage of this was essential goods. When we 
compete most heavily to buy foreign goods and when we all 
believe that we must buy famous foreign brands when we buy 
goods, then we can no longer expect domestic goods to develop 
and to rise to acceptable standards of quality. 
  Kamyar added: Don't we realize that Japan, which is at the 
highest economic level, reached this position by consuming its 
own goods. 
  He mentioned pouring banking facilities into the commercial 
sector, allocating high profits to the banking facilities 
because the production sector cannot pay the profits, and 
reducing the ability of the government banks to work with the 
noncommercial sector on such practices as the payment of housing 
allowances to teachers, and other things. The speaker then 
discussed the high percentage of unemployment in the 
municipality of Urmia and the stagnation of factories. 
<H5>  'Ali Movahedi-Saveji, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  Why don't the Speaker's Council and the public relations 
office defend the Majles against those who speak against it? 
  The final preagenda speaker was Movahedi-Saveji, deputy from 
Tehran. During his speech he said: Today one of the issues the 
imperialist world is trying to exaggerate is the issue of Salman 
Rushdie and his The Satanic Verses. All the Satans, 
the imperialist powers, and the enemies of Islam who have long 
been hostile towards Islam and the Muslims are supporting a 
filthy, spying, and mercenary individual who really wrote those 
things for money. 
  The deputy from Tehran discussed the fact that His Holiness 
the Imam's (peace be upon him) command concerning Salman Rushdie 
is the command of Islam and absolutely cannot be changed. He 
said: If Islam, the glorious Koran, and the divine verses in the 
Koran can be changed, this command can also be changed. As for 
the matter of carrying out this command, it must be done by 
people who are undertaking this sacred defense of Islam and the 
sanctity of prophecy with sacred intent for the sake of God. 
This will actually be a great act of worship they will be 
performing and it has nothing to do with a prize, money, or a 
reward. 
  In the same regard the speaker added: Of course, for every 
great Islamic and religious obligation, if those who spend money 
for the sake of God or who put themselves in danger are killed, 
they have performed a great act of worship and have been 
martyred on the path of God. The matter of setting a prize or a 
reward for killing such a filthy person may have something to do 
with an individual or a group, but it has nothing to do with the 
government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  He also continued: Throughout this period the Majles has 
neither studied nor approved any budget as a prize or reward for 
killing such a filthy person. However, if in Iran or anywhere 
else in the world any Muslim is able to spend his assets or 
wealth to please God and eliminate this filthy person, there is 
no problem with that either. 
  The deputy from Tehran discussed the pressuring and 
slaughtering of the people of Lebanon, Palestine, and Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. He said: I think that although Israel or America 
are really behind all these crimes, savage killings, torture and 
occupations of land, it is the hand of Zionism that has come out 
of America's sleeve, both in the present and in the past. In 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Zionists behind the Serbs are the 
ones who are in the European and American governments. They are 
trying to support these kinds of crimes financially and through 
propaganda and provisions. 
  Movahedi-Saveji discussed the prestige and status of the 
Majles. He said: I have a complaint against the respected 
Speaker's Council and especially the Majles public relations 
office. Why doesn't the Speaker's Council and especially the 
Majles public relations office provide timely, appropriate, 
rapid, and truthful statements defending the Majles against 
those who speak against it, who are actually violating the 
Constitution and slandering the Majles? 
  In the same regard the speaker added: A gentleman, competent 
or not, had a position of responsibility in one of the 
provinces. Finally he was fired and then he got another position 
and comes and tells that our Constitution is defective because 
it provides for interpellation of the president of the republic, 
but the president of the republic does not have the right to 
dissolve the Majles. 
<H5>  Deputy From Jiroft's Letter to Newspapers Concerning Recent </H5>
Statements by the Former Governor-General of Kerman 
  Although I have no intention of answering the issues raised 
by the respected former governor-general of Kerman and informing 
the dear and brave people of Iran, in general, and from Kerman 
Province, specifically, about what happened among the majority 
of the respected deputies from Kerman, because the honor of an 
outstanding public figure, His Holiness Ayatollah 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, the beloved president of the republic, 
requires that the sword of the pen remain in its sheath and that 
I not upset him, God willing his excellency will permit me to 
write at the appropriate opportunity about what happened during 
and before the time I was a deputy and to set it before him as a 
means of unburdening my heart and reducing my pain. However, I 
expect the respected individuals in charge of the newspapers, 
especially the influential newspapers RESALAT, KEYHAN, ETTELA'AT 
and SALAM, to print the following material concerning what they 
published about Mr. Mar'ashi, on the same pages and in the same 
columns and under the same headlines, for the information of the 
dear people. 
  1. The decision that he should not be a governor-general was 
made by his excellency, the president of the republic. 
  2. Have the 12 years of his experience been wasted or not? 
Who should answer? 
  3. If the government and the Majles are not together (God 
forbid) who must know? 
  4. The respected deputies definitely know that the Fourth 
Majles was formed with local sentiments and not on the basis of 
national interests!! 
  5. It is no secret to anyone that the dissolution of the 
Majles is a prerogative of the absolute vice regency of the 
chief jurisconsult and that during the revisions and amendments 
to the Constitution, His Holiness Imam Khamene'i did not permit 
this to be added to the Constitution, but who should know if the 
Constitution is defective or not? 
  6. Did the deputies from Kerman think the executive 
apparatus 
is like a corporation and that some of the officials were from 
the Movali ol-Movahedin Institute and the Milad, Mahan, Kerman 
Vehicle and other companies..., which is one of the remaining 
distinctions of Mr. Mar'ashi [as published]? 
  The answer is known to those who are aware of the Koran and 
the Book of God. 
  7. Why did many of the high-level officials of Kerman 
Province refuse to obey the decision by the respected president 
of the republic? Why did they abandon the ceremony of 
introduction on 11/30/1372 [19 February 1994], and leave the 
dear toiling and hard-working personnel in the office of the 
president of the republic waiting? They did not listen to the 
advice from the respected and dear Friday Imam of Kerman. They 
forced the workers and personnel of some of the municipal 
offices and other places to withdraw as if taking sanctuary 
during the blessed month of fasting. It is not clear who will 
answer for that! 
  8. Time has given the answer to "it is not yet too late." 
  9. You must ask the people of Jiroft about the "model 
governor-general"!! 
  10. The crying of people "which did not come from emotional 
women, but from men who were crying about all their limbs and 
wounds" was observed by all the dear passengers who flew without 
Mr. Mar'ashi after a long delay. 
  11. The servants of God, the respected deputies of Kerman, 
Sirjan, Zarand, Kohnuj, and Baft, and the respected minister of 
the interior...[as published]? 
  12. Perhaps they have started addressing a second-year 
college student in economics as "engineer" and we did not know? 
  13. Unlucky 13! It definitely was not, is not and will not 
be 
unlucky. What firmer evidence that it is a blessed number can 
there be than that after 12 years of successful service he is 
still friendly, although it is difficult and it involves these 
things! 
  14. God grant that this be the last press battle for the 
respected former governor-general of Kerman and the deputy from 
Jiroft. 
  With apologies to the sacred office of president of the 
republic.

  Deputy from Jiroft 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  Bill To Change the Legal Status of the Large University </H5>
Presses 
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the second consultation of the 
Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission concerning the 
Bill To Change the Legal Status of the Nation's Large University 
Presses and Institutions of Higher Learning, for which Article 1 
and its notes were approved by the deputies. 
  Article 1: All the nation's universities and institutions of 
higher learning are authorized to operate their presses as 
corporations. 
  Note 1: The wages and benefits of the workers in the 
aforementioned companies will adhere to the Uniform Payments 
System Law. 
  Note 2: For presses that are operated jointly by more than 
one medical university or nonmedical university, the shares of 
each university in the aforementioned press must be specified in 
the charter. 
  Note 3: The charters for the presses of the universities 
mentioned in this law whose status is changed to a corporation 
will be prepared by the Ministry of Higher Education and the 
Ministry of Health Care and Treatment, and will be approved by 
the Council of Ministers after approval by the National 
Administrative and Employment Affairs Organization. 
  Note 4: The presses covered by this law are required to 
allocate at least 50 percent of their work capacity to the 
printing of books and academic, educational, and research 
journals and publications for the nation's universities and 
institutes of higher education and research, and they must 
operate in such a way that their printing affairs are not 
disrupted or suspended. 
  Note 5: Any form of government aid to make up for losses is 
prohibited and the profits made must be allocated to develop and 
equip the same printing press. 
<H5>  Bill on the Use of Weapons When Necessary by Police Agents </H5>
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission 
Concerning the Bill on the Use of Weapons When Necessary by 
Police Agents, the general form of which was approved. 
  In view of the need to employ weapons by police officials in 
the performance of their lawful responsibilities in sensitive 
cases, which may sometimes lead to the death or injury of 
suspects, and in view of the fact that appropriate legal 
regulations have not been set exempting these kinds of agents 
from penalties for the performance of their lawful 
responsibilities and maintaining security in the cities, this 
has disturbed agents in many places, while suspects have not 
heeded warnings from agents because they are not authorized to 
fire. 
  In events that have taken place in Mashhad and elsewhere, 
agents did not have the authority to perform their missions at 
borders, guard stations and roadside interrogations. This bill 
permitting agents to use their weapons was therefore submitted 
and its general form was approved by the commission. It is worth 
saying that this bill must be studied in the second consultation. 
<H5>  Rejection of Motion To Detach the National Grain </H5>
Organization From the Ministry of Commerce and Attach It to the 
Ministry of Agriculture 
  The final item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs 
Commission concerning the rejection of the Motion To Detach the 
National Grain Organization From the Ministry of Commerce and 
Attach it to the Ministry of Agriculture, continued 
consideration of which was postponed to the next session. 
<H5>  Majles Notes </H5>
<H5>  Budget for Fighting the Cultural Invasion and Its </H5>
Expenditures 
  Yesterday, in a conversation with RESALAT's parliamentary 
correspondent, Dr. Kamran, a member of the Majles Islamic 
Guidance and Art Commission, criticized the performance of the 
nation's cultural organizations with regard to Note 55 of the 
budget bill. 
  He said: Last year, on the initiative of the Majles and for 
the purpose of confronting the enemy's cultural invasion, a 
special budget was allocated in the form of Note 55 for the 
purpose of implementing suitable programs in this regard. This 
year the government also included this in its 1373 [21 March 
1994 -20 March 1995] budget bill, but in view of most of the 
members of the commission, the performance this year by the 
organizations concerning this note was not positive. 
  In the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], instead of 
submitting appropriate programs for resisting the cultural 
invasion and spending this budget on that, the relevant 
organizations spent the money on the cultural programs they were 
already carrying out, and this is in conflict with the main 
goal. To answer the main message of Note 55, which is to carry 
out appropriate programs, the cultural organizations used this 
budget to buy organizational houses, to help the offices of some 
of the Friday imams, to build offices in some parts of the 
country and to complete some of their projects that were 
half-complete. These things are in conflict with the goals of 
this note. 
  We hope in the year 1373 the organizations will refrain from 
spending the money in this budget on the current tasks and 
day-to-day work of the organizations and will implement real 
projects to fight the cultural invasion. 
  Continuing, he said: Of the 60 billion rials allocated this 
year to fight the cultural invasion, about 80 percent was spent 
on programs other than fighting the cultural invasion. 
  Dr. Kamran also added: The Plan and Budget Organization's 
supervisory responsibility in this regard is not proper and 
complete, and this organization must exercise greater 
supervision to prevent this type of performance. 
<H5>  Letter From a Number of Deputies Concerning the Printing of </H5>
Bills 
  More than 80 Majles deputies sent a letter to the president 
of the republic asking that government institutions no longer 
publish bills and calendars at the beginning of the new year. 
  The full text of this letter is as follows: 
  To His Holiness Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, respected president of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran: 
  Peace be upon you, 
  With wishes for your excellency's success and acceptance, as 
you know, every year the ministries, companies, banks, and 
bodies of the Islamic revolution print large numbers of various 
calendars and bills at heavy cost to the Muslim treasury, and 
yet at the same time a large number of our students across the 
country are unable to obtain stationery, shoes, and clothing for 
the New Year's holidays. Therefore, we, a number of Majles 
deputies, are asking your excellency to issue a firm order to 
the organizations under the mantle of the government to refrain 
from pointless expenditures of this kind and to spend the money 
instead to procure essentials for needy students (for your 
information the report published in RESALAT on 12/3/1372 [22 
February 1994] is enclosed).

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs 
Division. 
  The Majles held an open session yesterday with Mr. 'Ali 
Akbar Nateq-Nuri presiding, and the deputies of the Jewish 
religious minority and the cities of Kashmar, Kohnuj, Ramhormoz, 
and Zarand of Kerman made preagenda speeches condemning the 
recent crimes of the Zionist regime. The speaker of the Majles 
also condemned the Zionist crime of killing the Palestinian 
worshippers. The Majles then went into session. We call to the 
attention of our honorable readers the details of the 
discussions. 
<H5>  Statements of the Speaker of the Majles </H5>
  In today's open session of the Majles, condemning the grave 
and unprecedented crimes of the Zionist regime in killing the 
Palestinian worshippers in the court of his holiness Ebrahim, 
Mr. Nateq-Nuri emphasized: One should stand up and fight against 
force; justice will eventually be victorious. The divine maxim 
is that justice will achieve victory. We believe that one must 
not retreat in the face of the oppressor. In fighting 
oppression, one should not speak of discussions, negotiations, 
relations, and peace. The nature of domination is to dominate. 
This is also true of the United States, which is the most 
criminal of all. 
  He then addressed the leaders of the Islamic governments and 
said: Whenever there is one step in retreat in the face of 
criminals, the enemy takes a step forward. If 'Arafat and his 
agents had not accepted the disgraceful Gaza and Jericho Treaty, 
we would not have witnessed such a crime. 
  The speaker of the Majles also added: Unfortunately, these 
criminals did not even act and will not act in good faith on the 
basis of this disgraceful agreement. Then, the trade leaders who 
claim to be the leaders of Palestinians and the PLO and other 
organizations sell the honor and dignity of the people of this 
land, and then the treaty will not have any results but crimes 
and treason. Today, while U.S. propaganda and U.S. talk of peace 
is heard in the Middle East, why do you think that such horrible 
crimes are committed? The Islamic countries, their leaders, and 
the Muslims should not be deceived by the foolish and deceptive 
explanations of the Zionists, who claim that this crime was 
committed by a few extremist Jews or soldiers with psychological 
problems. This is not true. For anyone to accept that a few 
extremist Jews did it and the Israeli Army and the United States 
had no hand in it would be extremely naive. This was certainly 
preplanned. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri also added: Although usurping Israel does not 
see an organized army of Arabs before its eyes, it does see 
before its eyes a strong, aggressive, and brave wave of people, 
which has been formed there as a result of the Islamic 
revolution of Iran and our movement. We see the horizon as 
bright, and in the near future they will see the fruits of their 
movement. Hence, the rooted resistance of the Palestinians and 
the children of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] cannot be 
endured by the United States and Israel. I believe that this 
crime is the start of a new treacherous and oppressive movement 
toward ethnic cleansing and destroying the resistance of the 
people in occupied Palestine at the hands of the Israelis. 
  The speaker of the Majles considered this Zionist action in 
conformity with the ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina by Serbs and said: The fact that the world is silent 
with regard to these crimes can be endured. What is important is 
that these crimes are neither the first nor the last. But what 
must be underscored is how the champions of human rights are 
silent with regard to such a crime. The human rights 
(organization), which sends its mercenary agent Galindo Pohl to 
Iran and quotes the reports of the Hypocrites and condemns Iran 
for having a prison or mistreating a Baha'i or changing the 
Baha'i cemetery in Tehran into a green area, those who profess 
their concern for human rights, think about this and spend so 
much to say: Why did you do such-and-such? However, in regards 
to such crimes, neither the United Nations nor the supporters of 
human rights raise their voices. Their silence in regards to 
these crimes is like their silence in regards to the Serbs. Of 
course, in a sense, the more of these crimes that occur, the 
more the waves in the occupied lands and in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina will increase; and the waves and blood, God willing, 
will dislodge usurping Israel, the United States, and their 
other supporters and increase the motivation to fight in the 
children of Palestine and in non-Palestinians. 
  It should be mentioned that after the speech of the speaker 
of the Majles, the shouts of "Death to Israel" resonated in the 
Majles. 
<H5>  Mohammad Reza Khabbaz, Deputy From Kashmar </H5>
  The first preagenda speaker was Khabbaz from Kashmar, who 
offered his congratulations on the anniversary of the birthday 
of Imam Hasan and, condemning the actions of criminal Israel on 
the previous bloody Friday, he thanked the people, the 
officials, and the deputies of the Majles for their presence at 
the funeral ceremonies of Hojjat ol-Eslam Qoddusi, the 
representative of the great leader in the Science and Industry 
University. 
  Stating that our revolution is based on three foundations of 
ideology, leadership, and the people, he said: Unity between 
these sacred foundations has so far brought us the great 
blessing of independence, freedom, and the Islamic Republic; and 
the continuation of these blessings and the ability to reach the 
peak of spiritual and material progress are possible under the 
auspices of the unity of these three divine gifts. God forbid 
that any harm should come to any of these three foundations, 
which would affect the other two. He added: It is our duty to 
make every effort to preserve these three virtuous elements and 
not allow certain economic pressures to befall our benefactors, 
that is, the people who have given martyrs. 
  The deputy from Kashmar then pointed out: One of the issues 
that causes the people to suffer is the uncontrolled and 
irrational inflation that puts pressure on the oppressed in our 
Islamic society. Even though the serving government has taken 
long strides toward the self-sufficiency of the country, the 
speed of economic modification is very rapid, and the oppressed 
in the society cannot endure these modifications. 
  He added: The elimination of subsidies is not in our 
interests at all. I, therefore, request that the government slow 
down the speed of economic modification. Otherwise, the weak 
people will not reach the desired destiny. Also, measures to 
prevent chaos in the market must be introduced as soon as 
possible. Who is responsible for prices? Do you know of any 
place in the world where there are no controls over or awareness 
of the price of goods offered to the people? In less than one 
week we have witnessed an increase in the price of meat of 100 
tumans, and there is no one to answer for it. In a few months, 
the rate of foreign currency has gone from 160 tumans to 240 
tumans, and no organization takes responsibility, and the 
violators are not dealt with decisively. 
  Khabbaz emphasized: Is the need to control prices not felt 
in 
the Islamic society? The greatest pressure is on that class of 
people with fixed incomes, such as employees, and those with 
low-level jobs. For example, until a few months ago, with the 
160-toman dollar, the salary of an employee earning 15,000 
tumans a month would be worth $93, but today he can only buy 
about $62 worth of goods with the same salary. In other words, 
not only have the salaries of employees not increased in 
proportion to inflation in terms of cash or material, but they 
also have decreased by about 30 percent. Instead, a small number 
of people in society who neither support the revolution nor have 
faith in the progress of the country, those whose God is money, 
have gained astronomical wealth with this windfall money. How 
long must these leeches suck the blood of the people of this 
country who have offered martyrs? We, therefore, ask the 
Ministry of Commerce to put the supervision and control of 
prices at the top of its agenda, to provide the grounds for 
nonoil exports, and to eliminate the obstacles to the export of 
nonoil products in order for the economy of the country to be 
cut loose from the umbilical cord of oil. Second, why do some 
economic terrorists still evade taxes 16 years after the victory 
of the revolution? Why, after identification, are the just taxes 
on their unimaginable wealth not collected? As a result, the 
weak worker and small business owner must pay for them. The 
deputy from Kashmar asked the government to treat these 
individuals in such a way as to make up for the past and to take 
their debts of several years from them, even by force, and 
render them to the Treasury. 
  The speaker termed the uncontrolled population increase one 
of the important economic problems of the country and said: We 
ask the government to confront this deadly phenomenon with 
proper and serious programs and guidance. Even though since the 
Islamic revolution the government has rendered a great deal of 
service even to the dear villagers, and despite the economic 
embargo, the imposed war, and the destroyed country inherited 
from the cruel monarchical regime, the government has been able 
to implement several times the number of developmental projects 
of the past in the most remote areas of the country to eliminate 
the problems of the country. In conclusion, he asked the 
minister of roads and transport to give priority to the 
strategic Borsekan-Sabzevar road and mentioned to the minister 
of petroleum the implementation of the Kashmar natural gas 
project next year. 
<H5>  Kuros Keyvani, Deputy of the Jewish Minority </H5>
  The deputy of the Jews condemned the horrible crimes of 
the Zionist regime in al-Khalil. 
  The next speaker was Keyvani, the deputy of the Jewish 
minority, who spoke briefly and said: Since several thousand 
years ago, when his holiness Abraham bought a cave in the area 
of al-Khalil in which to bury his wife and it later became the 
tomb of his holiness Abraham as well as Isaac and Jacob, this 
place has been the most sacred place of pilgrimage for Jews. The 
Association of Iranian Jews strongly condemns this barbaric 
crime and the massacre of the fasting, defenseless worshippers. 
  He continued: Especially given that all monotheists believe 
that eventually the existence of a single faith and common 
beliefs will result in peace and sincerity, this horrible crime 
and the disrespect shown for this sacred place are intolerable, 
and the perpetrators of this crime deserve curses and damnation. 
Certainly, the Government of Israel, which according to 
international agreements is responsible for the security and 
safety of the occupied lands and for preserving respect for this 
sacred place and its worshippers, has a grave responsibility in 
this tragedy. Keyvani continued: The Society of Iranian Jews 
demands that all the necessary investigations be carried out 
thoroughly and impartially in order that the perpetrators of 
this crime be punished. On behalf of the Society of Iranian 
Jews, in the wake of this tragedy, I offer my condolences to the 
grand leader, the families of the martyrs, the oppressed people 
of Palestine, our beloved compatriots, and the whole of humanity. 
<H5>  Gholamreza Mo'tamedinia, Deputy From Kohnuj </H5>
  The next speaker was Mo'tamedinia from Kohnuj, who offered 
his congratulations on the birthday of Imam Hasan Mojtaba and 
condolences for the martyrdom of the oppressed Palestinian 
worshippers. He continued: Since the victory of the Islamic 
revolution, the global oppressors headed by the Great Satan have 
not for a moment stopped their hostility against Islam and the 
revolution and have fought the revolution and Islam openly and 
secretly. 
  The speaker continued: By the grace of God and with the 
prophet-like guidance of the late Imam and the great leader, our 
regime continues rapidly on its path, and with each day the 
despair and hopelessness of the oppressors increases. The enemy 
accuses us of supporting terrorism. Perhaps the people of the 
world know how we and our nation have suffered at the hands of 
the terrorists who are protected by the oppressors. The best 
children of this land were assassinated at the hands of the same 
terrorists who continue their disgraceful life under the 
auspices of the oppressors. 
  In continuation, the speaker added: The hypocrite minigroup 
that is today accepted and protected in the official and 
nonofficial circles of the Europeans and Americans has martyred 
many Friday imams in prayer niches and placed bombs in public 
places. Why do they allow them in their countries, listen to 
their lies, and support them? 
  Stating that the false claimers of antiterrorist sentiments 
are themselves terrorists and nurture terrorists, he said: The 
human rights that we are accused of violating have been violated 
more than everyone else and before everyone else by the 
oppressors. Nowhere in the world and in no international legal 
system is respect for the rights of humanity as strong as in 
Islam and the sacred Islamic regime. 
  Mo'tamedinia continued: The Islamic legal system that is 
practiced in our country today is the most perfected of all 
legal systems in the world. 
  Then, in connection with the valuable services of the 
government in the 15 years of the revolution, given the tricks 
of the oppressors, the deputy of Kohnuj said: (The government) 
has gained great success in the area of development and 
fundamental work. To be fair, no one can accuse the government 
of not having worked hard. If at times some people make 
despairing statements, they are either ill-intentioned or 
uninformed. We have a duty to inform the people of the work of 
the government, but we must also mention the flaws. 
  In connection with the uncontrolled high prices that worry 
the people to a degree, the speaker said: While the government 
must pay special attention to the vulnerable and low-income 
strata in the society, I suggest that the government fix the 
prices of goods and services as soon as possible and carefully 
supervise them in order to achieve trade based on proper and 
just Islamic rules. 
<H5>  Mohammad Reza Bahmani, Deputy From Ramhormoz </H5>
  Disrespect for the sacred beliefs of Muslims is an 
unforgivable sin, and Muslims must not simply overlook it. 
  As another preagenda speaker, Bahmani, the deputy from 
Ramhormoz, strongly condemned the barbaric crime of the Zionists 
in the shrine of Abraham and said: Will the rulers of some 
Islamic countries relinquish friendship and support for the 
enemies of Islam? Past experience has shown, and this time will 
be no different, that all the constituents of the oppressors and 
the Great Satan will overlook the events. 
  He added: The United Nations and the Security Council, too, 
will merely condemn the action and will not punish the 
perpetrator or perpetrators. Based on the Geneva Convention, the 
security of the residents of the occupied land is the duty of 
the occupiers, and the Zionist regime must accept the 
responsibility for this crime. The regime occupying Jerusalem, 
by compromising with 'Arafat, has targeted all of Islam. 
Disrespect for the sacred beliefs of Muslims is an unforgivable 
sin, and Muslims must not simply overlook it. 
  He added: Muslims must by thoroughly understanding the 
tragedy and display a calculated reaction, because the West has 
made its choice between the Islamic world and the Zionist regime 
for years, and naturally the Islamic world must also make its 
serious choice. 
  He referred to the services of the Islamic Republic in the 
area of fundamental investments and said: Despite the population 
growth and the decrease in the price of oil, the country has 
been able to continue its services. Nevertheless, in terms of 
devising a budget and plan, it appears to have problems that 
should be mentioned. The operation of the First Five-Year Plan, 
in accordance with the ratification of the Majles, was supposed 
to have been presented to the Majles by the government, which 
unfortunately was not done. In many interviews there is constant 
talk of growth above and beyond the expectations of the Plan, 
sometimes up to 300 percent, yet there is no talk of the 
shortcomings and backwardness. 
  In regards to the annual budget, he said: Note 29 of the 
national budget is a note that every year deals with foreign 
currency issues. The content of this note, even though it 
strongly effects the economy, is rarely evaluated carefully in 
order that the deputies understand how the system has been 
working. 
  For example, the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget 
states that the Central Bank must operate so as to ensure that 
at the end of 1372 [20 March 1994], the total obligations 
resulting from the operations of the current account does not 
increase in proportion to the investment account of the previous 
years and the foreign currency reserves at the end of 1372 are 
less than the foreign currency reserves at the beginning of that 
year. Hence, the foreign currency policies in 1372 [21 March 
1993-20 March 1994] must have two characteristics from a 
budgetary point of view. 
  A) The foreign currency obligations of the country should 
not 
have increased compared to those at the end of 1371 [20 March 
1993]. 
  B) The foreign currency reserves of the country at the end 
of 
1372 should not be less than the year's figure. [sentence as 
published] 
  The deputy of Ramhormoz then emphasized: Why have Paragraph 
A 
and B, which were mentioned, not been achieved? Why has the rial 
been devalued so much? 
  In practice, how did some amounts, which were earmarked for 
accounting, actually aid the budgetary accounting? How do we 
evaluate the operation of the sale of foreign currency in 1372? 
How did the committee cited in Note 22, Paragraph A, Part 3, 
operate? How much of the foreign currency purchases of the 
country have been converted into rial purchases? Why is the rate 
of foreign currency in the 1373 budget lower than the rate of 
the dollar in the official markets? If the rate of the dollar in 
1373 is anticipated to decrease, we must note that at the 
present time, the rate of the dollar on the open market is 
higher than the floating rate. 
  The speaker continued: The 1373 budget must reduce the 
likelihood of new crises. Also, the budget cannot be 
economically justified. Hence, the inflation rate projected in 
this budget must be stated. To what level will it bring the cash 
flow? How will it regulate the gross national product? 
  He then said in regards to the management of heavy 
industries 
and mines and metals: These days, the people are witnessing the 
serious increase in the number of vehicles in the country. The 
Ministry of Heavy Industries, which enjoys such significant 
legal privileges as tax exemption, must saturate the consumer 
market through increased production and lower prices. Not only 
has it played no role in lowering prices, but it has been an 
important factor in increasing prices. 
  Before the ratification of the law on accounting and the 
collection of customs duties and commercial taxes and taxes on 
various kinds of vehicles and road building equipment and the 
manufacture of their parts on 02/10/1371 [23 December 1992], the 
implementation of which on 27/11/1372 [16 February 1994] on all 
domestically produced and imported vehicles with consideration 
for the laws at the time and the legal codes of the budget of 
the years prior to 1372, some amounts were collected as taxes on 
imported and domestic vehicles and other taxes and deposited in 
France. The difference in these amounts in 1371 [21 March 
1992-20 March 1993] was about 3.7 billion rials [R] and in 1372, 
R170.5 billion. For example, prior to the implementation of the 
1371 tax law, the Peugeot-405 GL was R19 million on open sale, 
and the tax paid was R5 million. After the implementation of the 
tax policy, this figure decreased to R800,000, but the price of 
the car increased to R30 million. 
<H5>  'Ali Motahhari, Deputy From Zarand of Kerman </H5>
  The last preagenda speaker of the open session of the Majles 
yesterday was Motahhari from Zarand of Kerman, who offered his 
condolences and condemned the Zionist crime of the slaughter of 
the Palestinian worshippers in the city of al-Khalil, asking for 
the widespread participation of the people in the march on 
Jerusalem Day. 
  Stating that our revolution is a revolution of values, the 
speaker continued: If in a regime liberal ideology has abstract 
concepts such as the relationship of the people with their 
deputies, the deputies with the parliament, the government with 
the executive and judicial branches, and the like, these are 
alienated relationships, because in such systems the 
relationship of all sectors with the parliament, especially the 
relationship of the people with their parliament, is limited, 
noninclusive, and nondynamic. However, with the blessing of the 
Islamic revolution, our Majles has found an exalted place, as 
the first manifestation of the ideals of the people and the 
embodiment of the virtues of the nation. 
  Continuing, in connection with the Majles, Motahhari said: 
The great founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran presented the 
Majles as the true house of the nation and the result of the 
calls of "God is great" by the people. The grand leader of the 
revolution also said that the Majles, in the true sense of the 
word, is the manifestation of the will and rule of the people. 
  If we accept that the Majles truly holds such a position in 
the whole regime, then how can a brother who up to a few days 
ago was the governor of Kerman make such unjust remarks about 
the position and status of the Majles? 
  In this connection, I ask for permission to inform the 
deputies of a few points. 
  1) He says that one of the deficiencies of our Constitution 
is that the government and the Majles do not have comparable 
importance. While the Majles can impeach the government, the 
government must also be given the right to dissolve the Majles. 
Indeed, has the time not come for this dear brother, even for 
one time, to carefully study the foundation of the regime and 
note that our sacred regime gets its legitimacy and the 
guarantee of the rule of God from the absolute rule of religious 
guardianship and the guarantee of the rule of the people in 
current affairs from the people. Therefore, when there are 
strong reasons for the eternal power of the regime, there is no 
room for the simpleminded. 
  2) He said that according to our Constitution we have given 
the central position to the Majles, that this deficiency has 
become evident and in several years may be corrected. 
  The question is whether he has noticed that the balance of 
power, the distinguished position of the leader, and relations 
between the branches are based upon the ideals of the Islamic 
revolution and the approval of the nation and the people in form 
of the Constitution. Contrary to his opinion, I must emphasize 
that, thank God, the relationship between the three branches in 
our sacred regime is based on the guarantee of achieving the 
goals of the revolution and the ideals of the people, with the 
thoughtful and remarkable direction of the Imam. 
  3) He says that our problem in the first years of the 
victory 
of the revolution was that we thought management meant company, 
or somewhere else he says, it is an erroneous tradition for 
every group that gains a majority in the Majles to put pressure 
on the executive system. Of course, perhaps if the majority 
existing in the Majles were that that he wished it to be, 
applying pressure would be no problem, according to him. It is 
perhaps for this reason that he tolerated the problem in the 
past. 
  In continuation, he said: What has to be said here is an 
expression of sorrow that he does not note that the deputies are 
the voice of their constituency and are considered the eyes and 
ears of the regime. Why should an executive official in our 
sacred regime not appreciate ponderous words from the mouth of 
the people and not pay attention to the eyes and ears? Is it not 
that the continuation of support and efforts of millions of 
people and the strength of this sacred regime is due to the 
respect that this regime places on the votes and words of the 
Muslim nation? Is it an unpleasant thing for this solidarity 
between the wishes of the people and those of the executive 
officials to exist? If they take a step for the people, do these 
officials not want to them to participate willingly in their 
destiny in the cities and villages? Is it better to choose 
unacceptable governors and officials with questionable 
reputations to run the affairs? If the law has given you the 
authority to select the governors, do you not want to make use 
of this authority to get better results, to carry out reforms, 
and to satisfy the people? Has the history of certain actions 
not clearly proved that it is not in the interest of our 
revolution to condemn and question anyone who does not agree 
with our personal and factional views and tastes, and to justify 
pressures? 
  The deputy of Zarand of Kerman also added: I hope that his 
honor, who was ultimately honored to serve alongside the 
distinguished personality of the revolution, the trustworthy 
captain of the executive ship of the country, the beloved 
president of the Islamic nation, God willing, will be the source 
of useful and effective service in the future, and such 
judgments and tendencies in him will end. 
  Motahhari then said: Yesterday, we were informed that a 
group 
of directors general of the offices of the province came as a 
group to Tehran. As the deputy of the people, I request of the 
related ministers sincerely that they ask their directors about 
the motive behind their trip in this situation and in the 
blessed month of Ramazan. Was this a personal or political trip? 
And, from what source were the expenditures of the trip provided? 
  In conclusion, he said: I request of the honorable minister 
of interior and pioneering revolutionary that in order to put 
the minds of the brave and patient people of Kerman at ease and 
make them content, the necessary care be taken in appointing new 
governors, and that it be noted that these people are the 
capital of this regime and the benefactors of all of us. 
<H5>  Ratifications </H5>
The Majles rejected the attachment of the National Grain 
Organization to the Ministry of Agriculture. 
<H5>  The Proposal To Separate the Grain Organization From the </H5>
Ministry of Commerce 
  The first item on the agenda of the open session of the 
Majles was the continuation of the examination of the first 
round of discussions of the Administrative and Employment 
Affairs Committee concerning the rejection of the proposal to 
separate the National Grain Organization from the Ministry of 
Commerce and attach it to the Ministry of Agriculture, the 
general points of which were not ratified and were rejected. 
  Among the reasons for the rejection by the above-mentioned 
committee: 
  A) From the viewpoint of the bylaws and the goals 
establishing it, considering that the goal in establishing this 
organization [was]: 
  1) Provisions (purchasing surplus products of the producers 
of domestic grain, if necessary, from abroad). 
  2) Storage. 
  3) Distribution. 
  4) Regulating the grain market. 
  5) Commercial, industrial, research activities and related 
services. 
  The above-mentioned activities are mainly in connection with 
the ratified duties of the Ministry of Commerce. Even though an 
insignificant percentage may be related to the Ministry of 
Agriculture, which is natural and essentially inherent in the 
organization's goals and duties, a percentage is related to 
other organizations. 
  B) In terms of governing policies: 
  Because grains are a strategic commodity, and in the past 60 
years, due to their grave significance, attention has been paid 
to them, and during the periods when they were in the 
agricultural or cooperative and rural affairs branches, they did 
not have a significant return, inevitably, in 1352 [21 March 
1973-20 March 1974] they were attached to the Ministry of 
Commerce. In the past 20 years, thank God, despite the war and 
internal crises, grains have had no critical problems, and since 
the revolution we have witnessed the relative increase in 
production of wheat and other grains. During the times when they 
were dependent on other ministries, due to incompetence, they 
frequently caused the fall of governments. 
  C) In terms of organization: 
  It seems that, as it has been decided that the general 
organization of the country should be reviewed, the discussion 
on the separation and attachment of an organization or an 
institution to some ministry would not be logical or worthy of 
the Majles, because it would waste the precious time of the 
honorable deputies on details. If the management of an 
organization acts weakly, the organization cannot be dissolved 
or moved. The operation of the organization must be examined, 
and the reason for the weakness must be found. These moves not 
only do not solve any problem but also add to the problems. 
There are many organizations, such as the Grains Organization, 
which, if we only look at the production aspect, we must move. 
Production [should be] in its own place and purchasing and 
distribution in their own place. 
  The continuation of the committee report states: Now that 
the 
honorable minister of commerce has recently received a vote of 
confidence, it is not expedient to daily raise the issue of 
separating an organization from the Ministry of Commerce. Let us 
see its operation in the future and engage in such actions. 
<H5>  Bill on the Establishment of the Supreme Council of Traffic </H5>
Coordination of the Cities of the Country 
  The next item on the agenda was the amendment by the 
Councils 
and Internal Affairs Committee regarding the bill on the 
establishment of the Supreme Council of Traffic Coordination of 
the cities of the country (returned from the Council of 
Guardians), which was ratified by the Majles. 
  The text of the amendment of Article 1 by the committee: 
  Article 1: In order to implement comprehensive and 
coordinated traffic policies and to improve the management of 
all affairs related to the issue of traffic, such as the design, 
planning, organization, coordination, guidance, supervision, and 
control of traffic in the cities, the Supreme Council of Traffic 
Coordination of the counties of the country, which will be 
called from here on the Supreme Council, shall be comprised of 
the following members: 
  1) The deputy minister of interior (president of the 
council); 
  2) The deputy of roads and transport; 
  3) the deputy minister of housing; 
  4) the deputy minister of post, telegraph and telephone; 
  5) the deputy director of the Plan and Budget Organization; 
  6) the director of the Environmental Protection Organization 
or his deputy; 
  7) the commander of the law enforcement forces or his 
deputy. 
  The ratifications of this council shall be mandatory for 
implementation, upon the approval of the minister of interior. 
<H5>  Amendment to Article 4 </H5>
  Article 4. The ratifications of the Supreme Council of 
Traffic Coordination of the cities of the country, which must be 
within the framework of the laws and regulations of the country, 
are mandatory for implementation for all ministries, 
establishments, government organizations, institutes, and public 
and private establishments. 
<H5>  Proposal To Amend the Registration Law </H5>
  The last item on the agenda was the urgent report of the 
Judicial Committee concerning the proposal to amend Articles 16 
and 20 of the law of the country on documents and property 
registration, of which the general points were ratified. The 
examination of its details was postponed to the next session. 
  It is noteworthy that Article 16 specifies the procedures 
for 
application for registration and protests against it, and 
Article 20 discusses the procedures for protest to the property 
boundaries, for which an application has been registered and 
submitted.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs 
Division. 
  The Majles held an open session yesterday with Dr. 
Ruhani presiding, and the deputies of the cities of Mahneshan, 
Takestan, Damghan, and Dorud and Azna made preagenda speeches. 
Then in a brief speech the deputy speaker of the Majles 
condemned the crime of the Zionists in slaughtering the 
Palestinian worshippers. Then the Majles went into session. We 
call to the honorable readers' attention the details of 
discussions. 
<H5>  Statements of the Deputy Speaker of the Majles </H5>
  In the open session of the Majles yesterday, Dr. Hasan 
Ruhani 
offered his condolences on the anniversary of the day that the 
Commander of the Faithful, 'Ali, was struck and then said: The 
striking of the Commander of the Faithful proved this bitter 
truth, that heathenism and hypocrisy have no logic but the 
sword, assassination, and oppression and that this weapon has 
always been used against justice, truth, free human beings, and 
the oppressed. Unfortunately, after the passage of centuries, 
today as well, hypocrisy and heathenism speak to us in the 
language of slaughter, terrorism, aggression, and oppression. 
The heinous and barbaric incident in the al-Khalil Mosque in the 
shrine of his holiness Abraham, and for that matter during the 
month of Ramazan, during the morning prayers, once again 
repeated the incident of the Kufeh Mosque. This time, however, 
not at the hands of one person but at the hands of a usurping, 
aggressive, and oppressive regime, which in order to carry out 
its treacherous and hypocritical plan in the region created this 
tragedy. Despite the empty claims and deceptive and hollow lies 
of the United States and Israel concerning the issue of "peace 
and wanting peace" and their readiness to stop aggression and 
oppression in the region, this shocking incident proved the 
point for everyone, even the simpleminded, that the Zionists are 
the same terrorists of yesterday, that no change has taken place 
in their nature, that they understand no language but bullets, 
and that there is no way to restore the rights of the 
Palestinians and liberating Jerusalem except through holy war 
and the unity of Muslims. As one of the main responsible 
elements in this crime and tragedy, Washington is neither able 
nor willing to solve the problem in the region. Solving the 
Palestinian issue is only possible at the hands of Muslims 
through unity and holy war. We hope that in these days of the 
blessed month of Ramazan, especially the sacred days and nights 
of Qadr and the days of guardianship and the imamate, we will be 
able to make the most spiritual use of these sacred days and 
nights and pray for all the Muslims in the world, particularly 
the oppressed people of Palestine and Bosnia and other oppressed 
people. 
<H5>  Reza 'Abdollahi, Deputy From Mahneshan </H5>
  The first preagenda speaker of the open session of the 
Majles 
yesterday was 'Abdollahi from Mahneshan, who referred to the 
striking of his holiness 'Ali on 19 Ramazan and said: On 21 
Ramazan, with the martyrdom of 'Ali, the history of Islam and 
humanity changed, and as it advanced, with the coming to power 
of oppressive governments, deviation from Islamic principles and 
injunctions increased. 
  He added: In this age, the offspring of ebn-e Moljam kill 
the 
fasting worshippers during Friday prayers in the al-Khalil 
Mosque, the racist Serbs engage in Muslim genocide in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, and the governments that support human rights 
endorse these crimes. 
  Pointing out that the people of Iran will certainly hold the 
Jerusalem Day ceremonies more magnificently, he said: Now that 
the blessed Islamic Republic is 15 years old, I shall speak of 
certain issues. To solve the problem of high prices, it seems 
that in addition to the training and employing of strong 
managers who are familiar with economic, social, and political 
issues, this fact must be admitted, that fighting high prices is 
dependent on increased production and more supply than demand. 
This is possible in one of two ways: 
  Increase in supply or decrease in demand. 
  He added: In order to increase production, we need 
investment, whereas we face limitations of capital and 
investment, and some investments exceed the expectations of the 
country and the people. The better way is to decrease 
expenditures, make the best use of resources and investments, 
and decrease consumption, which requires experienced, concerned, 
and brave managers who have the national interests at heart. If 
such a culture is formed in our society, we shall be certain 
that our revenues will increase every day, and more just 
distribution, wiser use of resources, and more reasonable 
consumption will reduce high prices and inflation. 
  The speaker continued: If the Majles, the government, and 
the 
people decide to reduce in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
only 10 percent of the uncontrolled consumption of oil products 
compared to 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], with the 
$1,898,000,000 in savings in this way, we shall be able to 
provide medicine and essential goods for all the people as well 
as employment, marriage, and housing for the young easily and at 
low cost. If the uncontrolled consumption continues, in 1377 [21 
March 1998-20 March 1999] our domestic consumption will reach 
3,295,000 barrels of oil per day. With such consumption, from 
1373 to 1377, we must build at least $17.5 billion worth of new 
refineries or import $24 billion in products. Most important, in 
1377, the level of our exports on the basis of daily production 
and consumption will reach 700,000 barrels, whereas our exports 
this year have been 2.7 million barrels, with a population of 
about 60 million people. In other words, the per capita annual 
export of oil will decrease from 10 barrels in 1372 to four 
barrels in 1377. 
  Then, to decrease oil consumption, he suggested: Attention 
must be paid to observing sound scientific principles in 
planning, reforming the administrative structure, reducing red 
tape for the people, making transportation networks more 
efficient, constructing buildings using technical methods, and 
preventing the production and entry of vehicles requiring high 
gas consumption. In addition to this plan, cash subsidies should 
be given on all essential goods and products for all the people, 
the per capita expenditures of which should be based on the rate 
of inflation, and prices should be made to be realistic, based 
on actual cost or the payment of coupons to provide for the 
urgent needs of the people. 
  In continuation, 'Abdollahi emphasized: In order to prevent 
inflation and high prices, calculated and expedient investments 
must be made. For this purpose, it is necessary to prepare and 
make available the chart of payments and collections as soon as 
possible. One important management skill is to best allocate 
resources at a time when investments are limited. 
  In order to prevent inflation and price increases, the 
logical and acceptable price of all services and goods, 
especially the products of government organizations and 
companies, must be determined by experienced experts. We must 
accept that the time of disregard for the quality of management 
has passed, and we must not allow consumers to pay exorbitant 
prices for goods and services because of weak and incompetent 
management. 
  For example, the minister of post, telegraph and telephone 
has often announced that one telephone line costs about $2,000 
in foreign currency, and recently in examining the 1373 budget 
revenues in the Planning and Budget Committee, he repeated this 
and announced that 60-70 percent of the foreign currency costs 
of every telephone line involves cables. However, one cable, 
which includes about 100,000 telephone lines, at the highest 
purchase price of the Communications Company, according to the 
officials of that company, was purchased for $20 million. The 
foreign currency for the cable amounts to $200 per telephone 
line. 
  If 60 percent is $200, 100 percent is $333 at the highest 
purchase price. At the maximum leeway for foreign currency use, 
every telephone comes to $500. Now, where does the $2,000 come 
from when, as the minister knows, expert evaluation indicates it 
should cost $500? 
  When we procure the same cable from Shahid Qandi Factory, 
the 
cost will be $60. Now, if we are to distribute the 5 million 
telephone lines in the Second Plan at prices several times 
higher, the difference between the actual price and the high 
price imposed on the people is about $7.5 billion. 
  He explained: If the prices become accurate, certainly weak 
and incapable people who are unable to offer goods of high 
quality at an appropriate price will be dismissed and strong and 
competent people will come to the scene. We must break the 
monopolies and monopolized prices by creating competitors for 
the monopolists and allow the private sector, at least by moving 
a few letters and establishing a few quality telephone lines and 
other services, to break the prices. 
  Stating that in order to prevent inflation we must try to 
reduce the rate of population growth, he said: As has been 
estimated, the population of the country in 1377 will reach 67.5 
million. For every person in the population on the way and 
future guests, we will need to spend at least $1,600 to provide 
food, clothing, etc. 
<H5>  Rajab Rahmani, Deputy From Takestan </H5>
  The second preagenda speaker was Rahmani the deputy from 
Takestan, who referred to the slaughter of the Palestinian 
worshippers by the Zionist regime, which is supported by the 
United States, and pointed out that they must be dealt with only 
with the language of weapons and reliance on the weapon of faith. 
  In continuation, he added: The traitors who have committed 
treason against the ideals of the oppressed people of Palestine 
and those who have submitted to the Gaza-Jericho plan should 
have realized this truth a long time ago. It is most unfortunate 
that the legal and international circles, the United Nations, 
and the Security Council simply overlook these crimes and under 
the pressure of the United States have continuously held a 
double standard in such cases. 
  Then, in connection with the Second Five-Year Plan, the 
speaker said: By establishing expert groups and committed 
experts, the Majles must work on the plan. The plan shows the 
social awareness of the people and the officials. Social 
awareness and conscience and the role of the people must be 
taken into consideration in designing and devising, and after 
the plan is adapted to the frameworks and policies determined by 
the grand leader, who is the divine mountain of dignity and the 
divine correct path, they should be implemented. 
  Also, in continuation, pointing out that despite the 
conspiracies of the enemy, the government has been successful in 
the First Plan, he asked the government to join forces with the 
people to take basic steps in harnessing unbridled inflation and 
high prices, supporting the vulnerable strata, stabilizing 
prices, and fighting economic terrorists. 
  Thanking the president in regards to eliminating the 
problems 
and impediments involved in dried goods, including raisins, by 
issuing appropriate instructions, which have been implemented to 
a great extent, the speaker continued: Considering the frequent 
requests of the people and the fruit growers of the province of 
Zanjan, which were made during his visit to Takestan and that of 
the officials, we ask the president to establish a grape and 
apple juice concentrate unit in this city as one of the national 
projects of the conversion industries. Most unfortunately, out 
of the millions of dollars in foreign currency in Note 27 of the 
1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] budget bill, not only has not 
one dollar been spent on this project, but with the negligence 
and disruptive actions of the concerned officials, including the 
officials of the Agricultural and Mellat Banks, the people and 
the government will suffer irreparable damage. 
  The deputy from Takestan also thanked Mr. Yazdi, the head of 
the Judicial Branch, and said in continuation: As was stated to 
his honor in the meeting on Saturday, 07/12/1372 [26 February 
1993], we ask his honor to issue a decisive order to the 
judicial officials and send a special representative to the city 
of Takestan in order to resolve the nine-year problems of the 
people concerning the land disputes of the farmers with the 
forestry and urban land and also to notify the National Document 
Registration [Office] to take steps in accordance with the vote 
of the Investigating Committee concerning the disputed lands 
cited in Article 56 in regards to the issuance of deeds in the 
name of the farmers. 
  He also asked the minister of energy to take urgent steps 
concerning the shortage of agricultural water and added in this 
regard: Considering the prohibition on digging deep wells and 
the very high drop in the underground water level and the 
decrease in the amount of water in existing deep wells, more 
than 3,000 hectares of agricultural land and vineyards are about 
to be destroyed, and it is not clear who should respond to the 
fruit growers. 
  He asked the minister of health and the head of the Social 
Security Organization to pay special attention to the city of 
Takestan and its problems and to find solutions to start the 
operation and equipping of the 96-bed sole hospital in this area. 
  The deputy from Takestan continued: I ask the minister of 
agriculture to take serious steps in regards to insuring the 
agricultural products and vineyards, which is requested by a 
large number of honorable deputies of the grape growing regions. 
  Considering that one of the necessities of the region is a 
center for research on the orchards; despite the dominant 
products in the region and the existence of Takestan as a 
production area, the country lacks a research center. 
  He also made a reminder to the interior minister concerning 
the annexation of villages 15-20 km from this city. 
  Concluing, he asked the Muslim and martyr-nurturing nation 
to 
respond positively to the call of the grand leader and, through 
their million-large presence in the march on International 
Jerusalem Day, to pledge once again their unity with the 
oppressed martyrs and the people of Palestine and Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. 
<H5>  Abolfazl Hasan-Beygi, Deputy From Damghan </H5>
  The next speaker was Hasan-Beygi from Damghan, who wished 
victory for all servants of the sacred Islamic regime and 
heathen-fighting combatants throughout the Islamic world and 
destruction for the Zionist enemy and global oppressors from the 
East to the West and said: Sometimes one hears and sees and 
hears from the statements and pens of informed and uninformed 
people unjust, incorrect, and unfair judgments. They say that 
the sacred Islamic regime of Iran is not only helpless in 
running the country but also even ordinary matters, or, affected 
by destructive foreign and domestic elements, they follow an 
incorrect path, distancing themselves from the foundation of 
guidance on the basis of divine injunctions. It is most 
unfortunate for such ideas to spread. 
  In continuation, he said: The sworn enemies in the East and 
West criticize our nation and country with such self-righteous 
posturing. Without reference to history and examining the 
present countries in the world, one can easily be affected by 
this. This country, until the victory of the revolution, with a 
population of less than 35 million people and $26 billion in 
revenues annually, was living in utter poverty, misery, and 
dependence. The breed of farmers and farming was about to 
disappear, and with the spread of the corruption and debauchery 
of the offensive Western culture, the end of the human dignity 
and Islamic principles of our people was in sight. 
  Pointing out that Iran is the mecca of the wishes and ideals 
of the oppressed of the world, he said: They know well that the 
country of the Imam of the Age has gained access to a strong 
economic power and know that they can never place us under 
colonial domination, like other Islamic countries. That is why 
they are always thinking of tricks and treason and, by spreading 
lies and baseless rumors, trying to deceive our alert people. I 
say strongly that Iran is proud in this wide world. The Iranian 
nation is proud, and we are standing completely behind the 
guardian of the Muslims and are hopeful for the day that justice 
will govern the whole world. 
  The speaker added: Our sincere people remember that until 
1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979], the total amount of asphalt 
and gravel roads was only 5,500 km. But now this figure amounts 
to more than 107,000 km, of which 65,000 km are asphalt roads 
and 42,000 km are gravel roads. Up to 1357, there were about 1 
million telephones, and in this short period of time the number 
has reached 4.5 million, which shows a growth of 395 percent. 
About the situation of universities and what stratum could make 
use of universities, but by the grace of God, now in 14 years, 
that is, up to 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], 40 agreements 
in principle to create higher education centers and 20 some 
cases of medical education centers have been issued. Student 
numbers have reached from 175,000 in 1357 to 500,000 in 1372. 
  He continued: The number of dams built would not exceed the 
fingers on one's hand; but now we have more than 100 large dams 
and dozens of small dams under construction and study. The 
Ministry of Petroleum and our National Gas Company were taken 
away by foreigners for free and hired Iranian people as 
servants. But today, by the grace of God, the ministry and the 
complex are operated by concerned and committed experts of our 
own country. Until the revolution, they had distributed 50,000 
gas connections throughout the country. With the blessing of the 
revolution, in these few short years more than 2 million 
connections have been distributed. And there are thousands of 
other examples, which I will not mention due to the shortage of 
time. 
  In this connection, Hasanbeigi added: Nevertheless, I see 
that while all these conspiracies and all this poisonous 
propaganda exist, while we have received an insignificant amount 
with regard to this wealthy country to reconstruct the industry 
and the war-stricken regions, I must say to the dear people of 
Iran that, at the same time that the so-called country, the 
United States, is one of the largest debtors in the world, 
comparative statistics show that the United States in 1991 was 
$828 billion in debt; Austria, $32 billion; England, $325 
billion; Iraq, $146 billion; Germany, $405 billion; Japan, $425 
billion; and Iran in 1991, $9 billion; Sweden, $172 billion; and 
France, $146 billion. Why do our enemies only publicize this 
insignificant amount of Iranian debt? It is clear that the 
growth and the future blossoming of our economy has made them 
upset. 
  In conclusion, the deputy from Damghan thanked the minister 
of petroleum in regards to natural gas outreach in Damghan; the 
minister of energy for water outreach in Damghan and building 
the Damghan dam; the minister of roads for expediting the 
Sari-Semnan, Sari-Damghan, and Damghan-Esfahan-Yazd road; and 
also asked the director of planning and budget to instruct the 
allocation of developmental funds for Payam-e Nur University. 
<H5>  Jahanshah Saddiq, Deputy From Dorud and Azna </H5>
  As the last preagenda speaker, Saddiq said: While the 
Islamic 
world, mourning the Sire of the Pious, sees that the true owners 
of Palestine are the target of the bullets of the illegitimate 
usurpers in the sanctuary of the divine prophet, his holiness 
Abraham, due to the incompetence of the Islamic governments and 
their neglecting the directives of the leader of the Islamic 
revolution in their own home, has the time not come for the 
children of the intifadah to follow the directives of the grand 
leader of the revolution and rescue Palestine from the claws of 
the traitors of Palestine and their enemies? 
  He added: The enemies of Islam must know that they will be 
punished with the help and power of God by the unity of Muslims 
throughout the world, the guidance and leadership of the revered 
leader, the perpetual presence of the Muslim people of Iran on 
the scene, and retaliation for the blood of the martyrs of the 
bloody Friday of Ramazan. 
  He thanked the people for their presence in the march on 22 
Bahman [11 February] and asked them to show a united presence, 
as in the past, in the Jerusalem Day ceremonies. 
  The speaker then continued: In the continuation of the 
examination of the budget bill, it is proper for the deputies to 
note that in this country there are regions that in the course 
of the sacred defense were not only not included in the 
developmental actions but had also offered all they had to the 
victory of the revolution as a duty. Has the time not come to 
pay attention to my constituency? In the course of the war, was 
an important part of the share of the provinces involved 
directly in the war not spent in other provinces? Is it right, 
under the present circumstances, for most of the national and 
provincial funds to be poured into wealthy provinces under the 
pretext of finishing incomplete projects? Has the time not come 
for the national planning officials to pay attention to the 
concerns of the leader of the revolution with regard to the lack 
of development of the province of Lorestan and declare the 
province a deprived province? Does agriculture, which is given 
first priority in the speeches of all the experts of the 
country, hold its correct position? 
  Concluding, he made reminders about the problems in his 
constituency. 
<H5>  Ratifications </H5>

records where the property is located. 
  Note 1. Property registration applicants or their legal 
representatives whose registration request has been protested

Agriculture 
  The second item on the agenda was the report of the 
Committee 
on Articles 88 and 90 of the Constitution concerning the 
question of Mr. Seyqali to the honorable minister of 
agriculture, which was read by the spokesman of the committee as 
follows: 
  After a careful, thorough examination of the documents and 
the details of the Majles discussions and inviting both sides of 
the question and to express their views and explanations, the 
committee announces its opinion as follows: First, the 
collection of one-half percent of the price of green tea leaves 
from the tea planters has been based on local agreements and, as 
admitted by the minister of agriculture, has no legal 
justification. 
  Second, based on the illegality of the action and the lack 
of 
justification, instructions have been issued that the practice 
be stopped. Third, after examining the cost of payers, the 
amount collected by the Tea Organization, which came to 2.6 
million tumans, has been returned to the farmers. Noting the 
above, the committee determined that the answer of the minister 
of agriculture was satisfactory. 
<H5>  Amendment of the Bill To Build Passenger Terminals </H5>

  The fourth and fifth items on the agenda involved the report 
of the Housing and Urban Development and Roads and Transport 
Committee concerning the bill on the international road 
transportation between the government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and the federative government of Russia and the Republic of 
Finland. 
  It is interesting that from Saturday the Majles will hold 
open sessions in three shifts (morning, noon, and night) and in 
the second round of discussions will examine the 1373 budget 
expenditures. Also, today the Majles did not have an open 
session. 
<H5>  Holding an Exhibition for Direct Sale of Goods in Shahrud </H5>
  Shahrud. RESALAT Reporter. 
  The exhibition for direct sale of goods was held for 10 days 
by the Department of Commerce in Shahrud in that city. In this 
exhibition, which was held with the cooperation of other 
departments, household appliances, writing supplies, foodstuff, 
academic books, and clothing were offered to the people of this 
region in 15 pavilions. 
<H5>  On the Margins </H5>
<H5>  Bylaws Reminder of Messrs. Naderi and Astaneh </H5>
  In the open session yesterday, Mr. Naderi the deputy from 
Bo'in-e Zahra made a bylaws reminder concerning the inquiry and 
investigation of the Ministry of Mines and Metals. 
  He said: An inquiry and investigation in connection with the 
Ministry of Mines and Metals was ratified in the open session on 
23/04/1372 [14 July 1993]. On 02/08/1372 [24 October 1993], in a 
letter to the Board of Directors of the Majles, the honorable 
chairman of the related committee requested an extension. The 
honorable speaker of the Majles on 30/11/1372 [19 February 1994] 
announced to the committee that the time for inquiry and 
investigation had ended and asked that the report be submitted 
immediately. On 03/12/1372 [22 February 1994], the honorable 
chairman of the committee announced to the honorable speaker of 
the Majles and the Board of Directors that the Inquiry and 
Investigation Committee had not presented any report to the 
committee. Considering the articles of the internal bylaws of 
the Majles, in my opinion, this report cannot be discussed in 
the Majles and is no longer valid. 
  After the reminder of Mr. Naderi, Mr. Astaneh also made a 
reminder based on [Article] 149 of the bylaws that at the 
present time a large number of inquiry and investigation issues 
are on the agenda of the Majles, the legal deadlines of which 
have passed. The inquiry and investigation of the steel company 
also, like the rest, has taken a long time. The honorable Board 
of Directors of the Majles should give more time, like in other 
cases, to the inquiry and investigation of the steel [company]. 
The report is being prepared. God willing, it will be presented 
in the near future. 
<H5>  Response of the Ministry of Education to the Issue in "On </H5>
the Margins" 
  Following the publication of "On the Margins of the Majles" 
quoting Dr. Kamran, the deputy of Esfahan, concerning the 
procedure to spend the budget in Note 55 in connection with 
cultural invasion on 05/12/1372 [24 February 1994], a response 
was sent by the training deputy minister of education, which 
follows: 
  Respectfully, in reference to the issue in "On the Margins 
of 
the Majles" in issue No. 2355 dated 05/12/1372 of that respected 
newspaper, concerning the statements of one of the honorable 
deputies of the Majles in regards to the procedures for the 
spending the budget in Note 55 (countering cultural invasion), 
please announce the following response in the same column. 
  Considering the four main issues: 
  1) about one-third of the population of the country, that 
is, 
17.6 million, are students; 
  2) the most vulnerable stratum of our society (because of 
the 
characteristics of the age of these young people) is students; 
  3) the most effective and constructive and at the same time 
the future builders of our society are students; 
  4) the thrust of the invasion, ambush, and cultural plunder 
by global oppressors is directed toward the students. Pointing 
out that, unfortunately, more than 10 percent of the above 
budget was not allocated to education but, based on the legal 
and ethical obligations, the whole 10 percent, about 612 million 
tumans (up to now more than three-fourths of the budget has not 
been allocated), was spent in the form of 15 new, often 
innovative, projects in connection with countering cultural 
invasion by the training deputy minister of education, as 
follows: 
  Line entitled programs and activities and projected funds: 
  1) Strengthening and implementing the well-known Yaran 
project, 300 million rials [R]; 
  2) strengthening and estabalishing a relationship between 
students and masjeds R300 million; 
  3) establishing porcedures for a debate and criticism group 
for the youth R300 million; 
  4) creating video centers (video clubs), R1.5 billion; 
  5) creating and operating 50 cultural and educational 
centers 
in provinces, border areas, and culturally vulnerable areas, 
R500 million; 
  6) purchasing books for school libraries throughout the 
country, R617,260,000; 
  7) establishing film accommodations in a number of high 
schools of the new system, R300 million; 
  8) equipping national camps and holding camps, pilgrimages, 
and tour visits and travels and field trips, R400 million;

Ramsar, R100 million; 
  10) establishing mountain climbing and hiking groups 
composed 
of students, R200 million; 
  11) establishing and equipping athletic centers in schools, 
R300 million; 
  12) carrying out projects for the establishment of mail,

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
first open Majles session for the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995] was held yesterday, chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from the cities of Hamadan, the 
Jewish minority, Bahar and Kabudar Ahang, Rasht, and Dorud and 
Azna gave speeches. Then the speaker of the Majles gave a speech 
concerning the exalted leader's speech about the work ethic and 
the social order and also about the injustice of the 
international organizations, which was printed in the previous 
issue. We direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the 
detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  Seyyed Jalal Sadatian, Deputy From Hamadan </H5>
  The Second Five-Year Plan must be written in such a way that 
it will make the people more hopeful about the nation's future. 
  The first preagenda speaker at the open Majles session was 
Sadatian, deputy from Hamadan. He offered congratulations on the 
beginning of the new year and the day of the founding of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, 12 Farvardin [1 April]. He said: In 
the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] many important tasks 
were completed and steps were taken to build Islamic Iran and 
make it more prosperous. The Majles approved and studied 
important motions and bills and gave a vote of confidence to Mr. 
Hashemi's new cabinet. It studied and approved the 1373 budget 
with a view to the Second Five-Year Plan, and it increased its 
control and supervision of the government companies. 
  He then discussed the high and proud role of the Majles. 
Continuing, he said: The exalted leader emphasized two basic 
elements, the work ethic and social order, as elements that will 
build a civilization with reliance on culture, insight, 
understanding and holistic human thinking, and he gave the good 
news that our nation is building a civilization. 
  For reaching this lofty goal, Sadatian mentioned the 
following points: 
  1 - Duplicate organizations, inefficient organizations, and 
organizations that do not work must be eliminated by the Majles, 
and the real needs of the people for organizations that provide 
service must be met through necessary elimination and 
consolidation. 
  2 - The Second Five-Year Plan must be written in such a way 
that it provides incentives for the people to work and make 
effort, and makes them more hopeful about the future. 
  3 - The Social Security, Social Insurance and Government 
Services Bill that is on the Majles agenda must be approved in 
such a way that it serves to develop as much as possible social 
justice, social incentives, and more public participation in 
social activities. 
  4 - To eliminate the negative effects of inflation and 
prevent the problems caused by high prices, in addition to the 
things provided in the 1373 budget bill, measures that will 
control prices and in particular, prevent monopolies, must be 
implemented. 
  5 - Discrimination is one of the things that undermine the 
work ethic and the social order. It is incumbent upon the 
judicial power to emphasize implementation of the law more than 
ever. In the same regard the deputy from Hamadan discussed 
greater cooperation between the government and the Majles in the 
year 1373. He said: An effort must be begun to encourage more 
than ever the spirit of mobilization and the spirit of doing a 
good job throughout this dear country of ours, which is busy 
with work and activity. For example two or three years ago the 
management at the Esfahan Iron Foundry was able to bring about a 
change and strengthen the work ethic in the work environment. In 
this spirit they were able to carry out a large part of the 
project. 
  At the end of his speech he discussed the importance of the 
role of the people in reconstruction, and he called for greater 
belief in the people in the reconstruction of the country. 
<H5>  Kuros Kayvani, Deputy From the Jewish Minority </H5>
  Contrary to the purposeful rumors of the human rights 
organizations, religious minorities in Iran have every kind of 
freedom. 
  The next speaker was Kayvani, deputy from the Jewish 
minority. He offered congratulations on the new year, and in his 
speech he discussed the Jewish holidays, which coincide with the 
New Year celebration. He said: For hundreds of years these 
holidays have been celebrated with complete tranquility and 
brotherly coexistence in this wide land of Iran, and they can be 
an example for the world. All the people of this land have 
worked and sacrificed their lives to preserve this freedom and 
solidarity. The minority martyrs are testimony to this claim, 
and it is confirmed by minority participation in the 10 Days of 
Dawn Celebration and on God's Day, 12 Farvardin. 
  The speaker also said: Perhaps a careful study of the free 
staging of these celebrations by the human rights organizations 
and societies would prove to them that, contrary to purposeful 
rumors, religious minorities in Iran have every kind of freedom 
to practice their religious rites and every kind of facility has 
been made available to them, including, the right to leave for 
the soldiers under the flag, government agents, and closing the 
religious schools on their religious holidays. 
  Continuing, Kayvani added: The religious minorities have 
always followed their religious rules in their individual lives 
and have been free to teach their faith. The Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran guarantees this. 
  He also said: History shows that comparing the Jews in the 
East for example with those in the Islamic lands and especially 
Iran, the latter have had greater freedom. If in the West it can 
be said that after the French revolution and what came from it, 
the Jews were given the full right to follow their religion and 
that the doors to cultural institutions were open to them, on 
the contrary in the Islamic lands and Iran the Jews have had 
scholars, professors and great artists and have played a part in 
the nation's destiny. They have even reached high government 
positions such as prime minister. 
  He discussed the fact that racism and limiting the rights of 
minorities and the publication and spread of inappropriate and 
empty insults are undeniably part of the imperialist political 
and cultural invasion. He said: A look at the sayings and 
writings of that great mystic and wise leader who founded the 
Islamic Republic of Iran will show the extent to which he 
respected the rights of religious minorities. Even in his 
political positions he always emphasized that we make a 
distinction between Jewish society and Zionism. 
  The speaker continued: As has been said many times, the 
banner of Islam and the great scholars of Islam and Shiism have 
always sheltered and protected religious minorities. 
  Therefore such writings and accusations are far removed from 
the behavior and actions of the nation of Iran, from the laws 
and goals of the Islamic revolution and from the Imam's path. 
The great spirit of Iran and the government of the republic, 
which is great because of the laws of unity and the legacy of 
the Imam's teachings, is innocent of these accusations. 
<H5>  'Ali Ya'qubi, Deputy From Bahar and Kabudar Ahang </H5>
  The triumph of the Muslims of Turkey shows their interest in 
Islamic culture and their contempt for the culture of the West. 
  The next speaker was Ya'qubi, deputy from Bahar and Kabudar 
Ahang. In his speech he offered congratulations on the new year 
and discussed the slaughter of praying Palestinians by Zionists 
at Dar al-Khalil last year and the silence of the international 
organizations. He said: The result of the silence of the 
international societies and organizations in the face of this 
savage slaughter and the criminal and compromising approach 
taken by most of the Western regimes to these crimes will be 
that we will see a repetition of the al-Khalil tragedy. 
  Continuing, the speaker also said: Despite extensive 
propaganda by the Turkish secularists, who have vast propaganda 
resources at their disposal, the Islamic Rifah Party was 
victorious in the Turkish mayoral elections, and I congratulate 
the Muslims of Turkey on this victory. This shows the awareness 
of the Muslims and their interest in Islamic culture and 
government, and their contempt and loathing for the culture of 
the West and secular governments. It is hoped that in the near 
future we will see victory by the Muslims of Turkey in the 
elections for parliament and other political areas. 
  Ya'qubi then discussed the exalted leader's New Year's 
message to the people and government leaders, and he asked them 
to strive to bring this message to fruition. 
  He then discussed increasing efficiency in the offices. He 
said: The structure of the administrative system must be 
revised. The existence of huge organizations with duplicated 
functions and a complicated bureaucracy will have no result 
other than to reduce efficiency and leave the public with no 
place to go. Improving management in the government companies 
and in the institutions affiliated with the government, and 
making using of committed and specialist manpower that is 
concerned about the Islamic revolution in key positions will be 
effective in improving efficiency. 
  The speaker then discussed social order and observing order. 
He said: We must all obey the law. If someone violates the law, 
he must be dealt with severely. If the laws approved by the 
Majles are carefully implemented, we will then no longer see the 
spending of some 6.5 billion rials on printing calendars and 
various magazines using funds from the public treasury. 
  In this same regard, he then discussed the fact that in the 
1373 budget these kinds of expenditures and frills are 
prohibited. He said: I ask the speaker of the Majles to take 
measures even as the year begins to economize and avoid 
ostentation and to deal with law breakers in accordance with 
regulations. 
  At the end of his speech, the deputy from Bahar and Kabudar 
Ahang discussed inflation and the fluctuating foreign exchange 
rate in the year 1372, and he called for dealing seriously with 
violators and punishing according to the law those who disrupt 
the nation's economic system. 
<H5>  Mohammad Baqer Nowbakht, Deputy From Rasht </H5>
  The next speaker was Nowbakht, deputy from Rasht. In his 
speech he offered congratulations on the new year. He said: The 
nation's management, in view of the characteristics and 
conditions in the year 1373, needs more planning and 
comprehensive thinking. The writing and approval of an orderly 
budget for the current year, whose approved revenues are less 
than 60 percent of the revenues approved for the previous year, 
and which has a 13-percent reduction in current expense credits 
and a 7-percent reduction in development credits in the Majles 
compared to the figures in the government's proposed budget, 
entails a coordinated effort by the government and the Majles to 
apply realistic management. 
  The speaker then discussed the utilization of the same 
resources and the submission of a more desirable performance 
report from the government and the Majles in the year 1373, and 
he called for the implementation of the following: 
  1 - The government should be careful to apply supervision, 
to 
intervene effectively in the nation's economic affairs and to 
deal seriously and lawfully with those who sell at high prices. 
Unfortunately, two related phenomena have always kept the 
government from taking real and proper measures in this regard, 
or else it has resisted. One of these two phenomena is the 
incorrect language some people have used, posing as concerned 
experts and economists, in describing the policy of economic 
adjustment and the need to adjust the market based on the 
mechanism of supply and demand. They say that practical 
supervision or any kind of government intervention in the market 
are obstacles to private sector cooperation in economic affairs. 
They suggest that the government's reasonable decision for 
rational and planned privatization may have been a mistake, and 
they constantly spread fear. 
  The other phenomenon is the invisible economic abusers, who 
create such a furor the minute the government intervenes in a 
market affair that one would conclude that wherever the 
government does something or intervenes in the market, the 
situation gets worse. 
  Continuing, he added: In submitting and approving the 
general 
form of the Consumer Rights Support Bill, the Majles and the 
government must first show that they are serious about this and 
that they will deal clearly with two realities, the first that 
government supervision and intervention to control the market 
and even with economic investment activities is not even in 
conflict with economic and investment goals, much less in 
conflict with the economic goals of Islam, and second that a 
distinction must be made between the private sector that wants 
sound participation and a reasonable profit in economic affairs 
and those who are abusers. 
  In this same regard the speaker said: Therefore, the 
deliberations in the second consultation on the Consumer Rights 
Support Bill will be a good opportunity for the Majles to make 
the government more careful about preventing uncontrolled price 
increases, most of which are done without economic consideration 
on the pretext that foreign exchange rates have increased, and 
to use all government resources to supervise the marketing of 
goods at the finished cost with a reasonable profit percentage. 
This supervision will be no less important than defending the 
public against an enemy military invasion. 
  2 - Realistic and praiseworthy measures the government and 
the Majles have taken, which must be compiled and approved in 
the best possible way in the year 1373, is the amendment to the 
Uniform Payments System Law and the increase in retirement 
pensions. 
  He said the implementation of this law has created many 
problems for government retirees. He said: In some cases 
retirement wages have dropped so drastically compared to 
employment wages that retirement is seen as complete bankruptcy. 
  Elsewhere in his talk he asked the National Expediency 
Discernment Council to approve Note 1, Article 1 of the 
Universal Payments System Law, which pertains to employees with 
bachelor's degrees and lower. 
  In conclusion he said: Another measure the Majles must take 
has to do with the Social Security Law and eliminating the age 
restrictions for women retirees. If this is done, women workers, 
who will have the ability to retire voluntarily without age 
restrictions, will have more of an opportunity to carry out 
their maternal responsibilities in the home. This will also 
create appropriate employment opportunities for individuals 
willing to work. 
<H5>  Jahanshah Sadiq, Deputy From Dorud And Azna </H5>
  The final preagenda speaker was Sadiq, deputy from Dorud and 
Azna. He offered congratulations on the new year, and in his 
speech he discussed the province of Lorestan hosting the 
president of the republic and the joyous and unequalled public 
welcome he received. He said: The deputies from Lorestan declare 
their praise and thanks to the respected president of the 
republic, and they sincerely thank him for designating the 
province as one in need of development, industrial expansion, 
services, agriculture, and other services. 
  The speaker also added: Following numerous follow-up 
measures, messages concerning Lorestan's problems and issues to 
the executive organizations and the statements by the president 
of the republic, it is incumbent upon the executive officials, 
especially the members of the Council of Ministers, to give 
importance to alleviating the problems in the province of 
Lorestan, changing the face of the province, developing 
industry, ancillary petrochemical industries and the Arak 
refinery in Lorestan, developing higher education and 
educational affairs, and other things. 
  In conclusion he thanked the minister of the interior for 
making Pol-e Dokhtar va Azna ol-Shotor a municipality. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  Health Insurance Bill </H5>
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the first consultation of the Joint 
Health Care and Plan and Budget Commission concerning the 
National Health Insurance Bill. 
<H5>  Joint Commission's View </H5>
  Hasan Aminlu, expert for the joint commission, gave a speech 
discussing this bill. He said: The nation's health care and 
treatment problems and malfunctions require that a basic change 
be made in the nation's health care system. This is necessary to 
establish social justice in the country and have subsidies be 
directed so that our people will receive good treatment, and 
also so that the people will not have problems when they go to 
the health care centers, which makes them disappointed with the 
government. 
  Continuing, he said: Clearly there are points in the details 
that will be changed in the second consultation. 
  Mr. Aminlu discussed the financial load from this bill. He 
said: Government staff employees are to pay between one-third 
and one-fifth of their own per-person treatment fees, and the 
government will pay the remainder as subsidies. If treatment 
retains its current subsidy and if the treatment situation is 
like this, and if government makes infrastructure investments 
for treatment, then the per-person cost of treatment at current 
rates will be 500 tumans. 
  Workers will be treated in accordance with the Social 
Security Law, and clearly a load will thereby be added to the 
Social Security Organization's responsibilities. Concerning 
rural people, the fee will be 250 tumans, of which one-third 
will be paid by the rural people themselves and the rest by the 
government as subsidies. Self-employed people will pay 100 
percent of the costs themselves. 
  The government now pays 75 billion tumans for insurance. In 
the year 1373 the government will also pay 15 billion tumans for 
staff employees, bringing the total to 90 billion tumans. The 
government has also set aside 4 billion tumans to give the 
Imam's Aid Committee for the vulnerable classes. Therefore the 
total subsidies for treatment is 94 billion tumans. 
  However, the cost to the government in connection with this 
bill will be as follows: if we take 10 million people from the 
vulnerable classes into consideration at the 500 tumans, this 
will be 96,000 tumans for each person and for that number of 
people the total will be 60 billion tumans. If we consider 25 
million rural people at 1,500 tumans per person per year, this 
will total 375 billion tumans. For 5 million government staff 
employees the cost will be 22.5 billion tumans, and the total 
for all groups will be 120 billion tumans. The government will 
also have to pay some 20 billion tumans for repeat treatment. 
The commission expert discussed the hospitals absorbing their 
own high costs. He said: The hospitals absorbing their own high 
costs is provided for until the end of the Second Five-Year Plan. 
<H5>  Dr. Jabbarzadeh, Opposition </H5>
  Dr. Jabbarzadeh, deputy from Tabriz, spoke in opposition to 
the general form of the bill. He said: This bill cannot solve 
the existing insurance problems. Also, with the formation of the 
Supreme Insurance Council, in effect the main responsibility of 
the minister of health care and treatment is being taken away 
from him and will be given to a nonspecialist council. Another 
of his objections to the bill is its method of financial 
procurement. He said: Every year the price of social security is 
increased. How are those who are covered by social security 
insurance going to pay for it? 
  He then criticized the policy of transferring government 
hospitals to the private sector. He said: The entire message of 
the bill is the transfer of government hospitals to the private 
sector, and if this bill is approved it will not benefit the 
people. 
<H5>  Dr. Zare', Support </H5>
  Dr. Zare', deputy from Shiraz, spoke in support of the bill. 
He said: It is very important to have proper supervision of the 
implementation of treatment and providing coverage to all the 
people in society, and this need requires that a new change be 
made in the insurance system. 
  He also said: One of the bill's distinctions is that it will 
end the insurance monopoly . That is, people will be able to 
meet their treatment expenses entirely through insurance, and 
the physician's ties to money will be completely cut. 
<H5>  Rahbari, Opposition </H5>
  Rahbari spoke in opposition to the National Health Insurance 
Bill. He said: The new insurance system that you want to pass 
will bring increased prices for the people. When you want to 
modernize the treatment system, in practice the people for whom 
you want to provide treatment will have to pay a high price for 
it, and in practice a person who cannot pay will expire. 
  He also added: Why is it that the physicians, pharmacies, 
and 
treatment centers do not accept this insurance? You go and look 
for the reason. The financial burden issue is that whoever has 
more money will receive good treatment, and a person who cannot 
pay will expire. 
  Rahbari also noted: What mechanism exists so that our rural 
people can go and get insured? Since they are not connected to 
any place that can insure them, in effect those who are old and 
in need of treatment will be insured, and those who are young 
will not be insured. In practice this will mean that the 
financial burden on the government's shoulders will be great, 
and this is very damaging and will hurt the nation's treatment 
system. 
<H5>  Kuhkan, Support </H5>
  Another supporter of the aforementioned bill was Mohsen 
Kuhkan. During a speech he said: One of the bill's distinctions 
is that if we are going to subsidize drugs and treatment, we 
should give it directly to the patient, not to the importer, the 
distributor, and other people. 
  He then added: The gentlemen are saying that the nation and 
the government will have to pay more money, but this is not 
correct. Approving the bill will raise the quality of treatment, 
and this is acceptable to everyone. 
<H5>  Nurbakhsh, Opposition </H5>
  Nurbakhsh spoke in opposition to this bill. He said: What 
they always say about drugs is that they are not available in 
the pharmacies, but they can be found on Naser Khosrow Street. 
Is there any guarantee that when this bill is approved we will 
no longer have problems getting drugs? He also said: Where in 
this bill does it say anything about society's vulnerable 
classes? We believe that government staff employees are also one 
of these vulnerable classes. 
  He also added: We believe that this bill reduces the 
prerogatives of the Ministry of Health Care, Treatment and 
Medical Education. We must strengthen this organization so it 
can supervise drugs and treatment. We should not reduce its 
supervisory role and give it to a council. 
<H5>  Dr. Sadr, Support </H5>
  Dr. Sadr, deputy from Tehran, spoke in support of this bill, 
arguing we cannot say that universal insurance is not a good 
thing. He said: Every day the price of treatment supplies 
increases in the world and we cannot deny this. One day our 
brothers in the provinces were trying to get a CAT scan machine, 
and now they are trying to get an MRI machine. Next they will be 
wanting a laser machine. Therefore we cannot ignore these 
issues. We must accept the realities. In the nation's 
dysfunctional drug and treatment situation, this bill can solve 
some of the nation's problems. 
  He then said: The government cannot bear the country's 
entire 
burden. This will never happen. However, with the government's 
resources and the money the government pays to the insurance 
fund, it will definitely benefit the people. Dr. Sadr also 
added: High prices have nothing to do with the bill, because if 
you do not approve this bill, drugs and treatment will 
automatically go up. 
<H5>  Nowruzi, Opposition </H5>
  'Abdollah Nowruzi, deputy from Molayer, spoke in opposition. 
He said: On the first Majles work day of the year, we are giving 
our nation the good news that Majles is causing prices to rise. 
We accept universal insurance, but this bill is not universal 
insurance. 
  He then said: When you want to collect the finished cost of 
drugs and treatment, how can professionals and self-employed 
people, many of whom do not have financial resources, bear the 
burden of these costs? The cost of heart surgery is already 1 to 
2 million tumans. Who can pay for that? He said: The 
unemployment rate is already 11 percent. Do those people have 
the ability to pay for insurance? What are they going to do? 
  Nowruzi added: Mr. Hoseyni Shahrudi went to the hospital for 
treatment. When he came back he said: "what a joke." If they 
tell me to turn the military bases over to the private sector, I 
will do so, but I believe you should not transfer the hospitals. 
<H5>  Dr. Shahrzad, Support </H5>
  Dr. Shahrzad, deputy from Esfahan, spoke in support with the 
bill. He said: I say to our dear people, treatment in the year 
1373 will be as it was before, and there will be no change in 
rates or organization. In view of the fact that this bill is 
going through its first consultation, and its credit resources 
will have to be procured in the year 1374 [21 March 1995-20 
March 1996], this is an answer to some of the respected 
opponents, for studying and approving this bill is not 
inconsistent with the Second Five-Year Plan, and it is certainly 
better for us to study it in the year 1373, The plans for 
universal insurance and social security services is definitely 
part of the Second Five-Year Plan. It is very likely that its 
implementation will be deferred to the year 1374. 
  He then said: I support the general form of the bill, but I 
do not fully support the bill's current form. When we reject 
this bill, that will mean that although the existing situation 
is not desirable, we want to accept it [as published]. 
  Dr. Dastjerdi, a woman speaking in support of the bill, 
said: 
The government has left the deputies a free hand to make any 
kind of change to this bill. Today is a good opportunity for the 
Fourth Majles to correct the insurance situation for 35 million 
people in society. I am surprised that the opponents are saying 
this bill will make the situation worse for the people. Those 
who do not have an insurance booklet, such as the rural people 
and society's vulnerable classes, do not have anything. How are 
these people going to go to the treatment centers? For Caesarian 
operations in government hospitals, they must pay 20,000 tumans. 
Where are they going to get this? 
  She said: I have 70 office calls every day, and 20 of them 
have counterfeit insurance booklets from other people, because 
they do not have the money to pay. 
  She also emphasized: We members of the commission are 100 
percent opposed to transferring hospitals to the private sector, 
but the hospitals must absorb their own high costs in this way 
so that they will economize on the materials they consume. 
  The minister of health care and treatment also spoke in 
support of this bill, and then the general form of the bill was 
put to a vote and approved.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. Last 
Tuesday the Majles met in open session chaired by Mr. 
Movahedi-Kermani. Maqsudpur, deputy from the Assyrian and 
Chaldean minorities, and Rowhani, deputy from Mahallat and 
Dalijan, gave speeches. Then Mr. Movahedi gave a short speech in 
which he offered condolences on the martyrdom of Imam Ja'far 
Sadeq (peace be upon him). Then the Majles took up its agenda, 
and we direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the 
details of the proceedings. 
<H5>  Shamshun Maqsudpur, Deputy From the Assyrian and Chaldean </H5>
Minorities 
  In the area of food production, Iran can become a major 
exporter. 
  The first preagenda speaker at last Tuesday's open Majles 
session was Maqsudpur, deputy from the Assyrian and Chaldean 
minorities. He offered congratulations on the new year and 
discussed the priorities in the Second Five-Year Plan and its 
administrative weaknesses. He said: Economic experts and the 
nation's executive officials agree that the deadend arising from 
oil revenues must be resolved by increasing oil export 
activities. Under current circumstances agriculture is certainly 
the most important sector for achieving this objective, and it 
therefore demands special attention from the government. 
  He discussed the fact that Iran, which has the necessary 
resources, can achieve self-sufficiency in food production and 
can even become a major food exporter. He added: Last year, 
despite the limitations in this area, agricultural exports made 
up 40 percent of the nation's nonoil exports, and the 
agricultural sector accounted for 24 percent of the gross 
domestic product. We are already very close to self-sufficiency 
with regard to several very important products, yet only 25 
percent of the arable lands are being used. 
  Continuing, he cited some of the important problems and 
priorities in the Second Five-Year Plan, including the need to 
alleviate the problems with ownership of agricultural lands; the 
need to change the system of utilization and to gradually get 
away from the limitations of the traditional system; the need 
for technical determination of cultivation methods for crops, 
which for years have alternately been subject to severe 
fluctuations on the consumer market; the need to increase 
investment in the industries affiliated with agriculture, 
emphasis on research and the education of farmers; the 
encouragement of agricultural exports; the guarantee of 
investment in the agricultural sector; and finally the need to 
procure judicial security in the country. 
  Continuing, he added: The need to give attention to 
agriculture is also important in the political dimension. For 
years the imperialist forces have used food as a weapon of war 
to impose their political views and they have imposed food 
boycotts on some countries. The possibility of using this weapon 
is still strong. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: There is no doubt that 
achieving the aforementioned objectives will require a revision 
of the organizational structure and the creation of unified 
management organizations. It is hoped that in the studies now 
being done to bring about change in this country's 
administrative system, attention will also be given to this 
important matter. 
  Continuing, the deputy from the Assyrians said: The 
procedures provided in the Second Five-Year Plan for the 
government's executive agents are being implemented. The 
executive agents in terms of organizations are the ministries, 
and the government organizations and institutions. The 
organizational positions in each of them are held by human 
beings. Therefore if a comprehensive and appropriate management 
program composed of truly skilled and committed agents for 
implementing the programs does not emerge, this plan will 
undoubtedly be the subject of articles in the magazines. 
  He discussed the fact that so far no revolutionary steps 
have 
been taken to solve the problem of the bureaucracy and reform 
the administrative system and structure. He said: The nation's 
administrative problem is not merely a matter of malfunctions in 
the law or too many regulations. The major problem is considered 
to be the way the laws are implemented and how some executive 
officials deal with the public. It is in this regard that 
unaware or counterrevolutionary individuals appear with their 
filthy intentions to sow discontent. 
  In the same regard, the deputy from the Assyrians added: An 
example of nonrevolutionary dealings with the people by some 
officials is the hostile takeover of the property owned by the 
Tehran Assyrian Society on Azadi Street. About a year ago, in 
the middle of the night these urban lands were confiscated by 
the District 10 Municipal Office without informing the owner and 
obeying the Lands Possession Law. After this land was 
confiscated and the vegetation was destroyed, a sign identifying 
it as a place for cultivating municipal flowers and plants for 
the District 10 Municipal Office was erected, but instead of a 
place to grow flowers and plants it became a parking lot. 
Repeated contacts by the society's officials with the district 
municipal office have so far brought no result, despite repeated 
promises and the failure to implement the Urban Lands Possession 
Law. Several letters to the Ministry of the Interior have also 
gone unanswered. 
  Maqsudpur said he brought this matter up in the Majles 
reluctantly and that he had no choice other than to ask the 
minister of the interior to issue the necessary order concerning 
this matter. 
  In conclusion the speaker asked the minister of education 
and 
training to implement the measure enacted by the commission in 
charge of schools for religious minorities and the written 
commitment from Education and Training District 5 to close the 
afternoon shift at the Her Holiness Mary Educational Complex, 
because in the afternoons the classroom space under discussion 
is badly needed to carry out supplementary programs for students. 
<H5>  Mostafa Rowhani, Deputy From Dalijan and Mahallat </H5>
  Isn't it a shame that Muslim girls in France are expelled 
from school for wearing Islamic attire? 
  The final preagenda speaker was Rowhani, deputy from 
Mahallat 
and Dalijan. During his speech he offered congratulations on the 
new year and condolences on the martyrdom of Imam Ja'far Sadeq 
(peace be upon him). He said: According to the experts, in the 
years 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] and 1372 [21 March 
1993-20 March 1994], 31 of the 40 known natural and unnatural 
disasters in the world took place in Iran. According to the 
published statistics these losses total R1,000 billion. 
  Therefore, in view of the losses from the period of the 
Islamic revolution and the imposed war and the various 
disasters, it will be difficult to make up the losses, and one 
must pray for the success of the nation's highest officials. 
  Continuing, the speaker added: The First Five-Year Plan, 
with 
the implementation of infrastructure and essential work in the 
various organizations, has concluded more or less successfully. 
We have come close to self-sufficiency. The year 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] will be a year to welcome the Second 
Five-Year Plan. With guidance from our great leader, it will 
find reconciliation with God and the people. 
  Rowhani noted that we will endure all hardships to please 
God. He added: Some people have compared life to a battlefield, 
and they consider it a struggle to survive. Some people compare 
life to a playing field and consider life a matter of 
cooperation and competition. The need for competition entails 
two things, individual freedom and social order. This was the 
content of the exalted leader's New Year's message, who advised 
the nation to strengthen its work ethic and to observe social 
regulations in all affairs. 
  Perhaps this is the very thing that is needed for society to 
take on the form of a playing field where everyone has the right 
to compete and where positions and jobs are given based on 
individual talent and effort to those who have shown themselves 
more worthy in social competition. If someone violates the law, 
he is punished and is not exempt from Islamic punishments. 
Islamic justice is implemented, and the executive officials find 
the mechanism to implement justice, which is the elimination of 
racism and improper discrimination, because the exalted leader 
wants social justice to be carried out, and this goal will be 
achieved with the implementation of the commands of Islam. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: Isn't it a shame that today, 
despite the fact that everyone is free to choose how to dress, 
in France Muslim girls are expelled from school for the crime of 
wearing Islamic attire, and are deprived of education? 
  The deputy from Mahallat and Dalijan also said: The experts 
believe that in the year 1372 Iran's economy went through one of 
its most difficult years in the process of moving away from an 
economy relying on the market, and it suffered many pressures 
caused by economic adjustment. The fluctuating foreign exchange 
market increased so much that it was almost unprecedented in all 
of Iran's history. It is hoped that last year an historic lesson 
was learned by the nation's foreign exchange management. Of 
course, the repayments and extensions of the period allowed to 
meet financial commitments in the year 1372 was a great success, 
and in the year 1373 the government will find an opportunity to 
solve its economic problems. 
  Rowhani discussed the fact that the exalted leader of the 
Islamic revolution and the chiefs of the three powers all follow 
the school of Imam Sadeq (peace be upon him), they understand 
the exigencies of the time well and they have never abandoned 
their simple way of life. He added: Those who are close to them 
know that their way of life is even simpler than it was before 
the revolution. 
  He discussed the approval of the project to set prices and 
supervise basic goods by the Economic Council and the president 
of the republic in the year 1372. He called on the minister of 
commerce to implement this project as soon as possible. 
  The speaker also added: Our people do not complain about 
shortages, because our production is good, but they complain 
about discrimination and distribution. 
  At the end of his speech he issued memos to the officials 
concerning his electoral district. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  Bill Appending Note to Article 1 of Police Force Law </H5>
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the first consultation of the 
Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission concerning the Bill 
Appending a Note to Article 1 of the Police Force Law, the 
general form of which was not approved and was rejected. 
  Concerning this a replacement said: "All the executive 
organizations, which due to the necessity for lawful 
authorization have a unit to protect and guard their assets, 
resources and installations, will be exempt from Note 1 with 
approval from the Council of Ministers." 
  It is worth mentioning that the Councils and Domestic 
Affairs 
Commission rejected this bill, for which the most important 
reasons are as follows: 
  1 - The basic conflict between the proposed bill and the 
philosophy of the law consolidating police forces, enacted by 
the Majles, which was aimed at consolidating forces and 
centralizing the police security forces. 
  2 - The conflict between the proposed bill and the nation's 
general policies on the need for unity and a single organization 
for the police and security forces. 
  3 - So far the note to Article 1 of the police force law 
requiring the merging of the police guards in the government 
organizations with the police forces has not been implemented 
nor has it elicited praise or blame due to the fact that the 
Employment Law is still before the Majles. Therefore, to approve 
this bill would be to change the earlier Majles measure too soon. 
  4 - It is necessary that all the armed forces be connected 
to 
the General Armed Forces Command Staff so that this can be 
achieved by merging the organization security forces into the 
police force and putting them under its mantle. Approving this 
bill would be in conflict with that policy. 
  5 - Maintaining order and security in accordance with the 
law 
is the responsibility of the police force. According to 
Paragraph 5, Article 4, the mission and duties of the police 
force as enacted in 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] is to 
protect the classified sites and points, and approving this bill 
would be in conflict with the previous measure. 
<H5>  Motion To Supervise Government Employee Foreign Travel </H5>
  The second item on the agenda was the urgent Motion To 
Supervise Government Employee Foreign Travel, the general form 
of which was approved. 
  Concerning this motion, the opposing deputies took the view 
that the aforementioned motion was already given Note 13 of the 
1373 budget bill, and that there is no need for a new law. The 
supporters emphasized that the budget is for one year and cannot 
be a permanent law. 
  It is worth mentioning that a number of the deputies sought 
to eliminate the motion's urgent status. Discussing this 
proposal, Mohammad Reza Bahonar said: Since we have a law for 
the year 1373, the aforementioned motion should therefore be an 
ordinary motion that will have a second consultation, in order 
to be comprehensive and well-considered. It will be worked on 
for a year in order to be implemented in the year 1374 [21 March 
1995-20 March 1996]. 
  After talks by opponents and supporters, the proposal to 
remove the urgent status was put to a vote and approved. 
<H5>  Motion To Protect and Utilize Wetlands </H5>
  The next item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Agriculture Commission concerning the Motion 
To Protect and Utilize the Wetlands of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, the general form of which was approved. 
<H5>  Amendment to Article 17 of the Judicial Courts Appeals Law </H5>
  The fourth item on the agenda was the report from the second 
consultation of the Judicial Affairs Commission concerning the 
Motion To Amend Article 17 of the Judicial Courts Appeals Law, 
enacted 5/17/1372 [8 August 1993], which was approved by the 
deputies. 
  Article 1: Article 17 of the Judicial Courts Appeals Law 
enacted 5/17/1372 is amended as follows: 
  Article 17: In cases where a court's final verdict is in 
conflict with religious law or the law, even if it has been 
affirmed by the Supreme Court, within 30 days of the verdict's 
announcement the national public prosecutor may request one 
review from the Supreme Court. A special branch of the National 
Supreme Court will be designated to deal with these cases. 
<H5>  Motion To Append a Paragraph to Note 15 of the 1372 Budget </H5>
Bill 
  The next item on the agenda was the report from the second 
consultation of the Accounting Court Commission concerning the 
Motion To Append a Paragraph to Note 15 of the 1372 National 
Budget Bill, of which Article 1 was approved. 
  Article 1: Because of the special procedures in the 
educational system, Payam-e Nur University may again spend 65 
percent of its current expense and allocated credits and also 25 
percent of its development credits based on the Law on 
Procedures for Conducting Financial Affairs and Transactions of 
the Universities and Institutions of Higher Learning and 
Research, without adhering to the government's other general 
regulations. 
<H5>  Report on the Research and Investigation of the Haj and </H5>
Pilgrimages Organization 
  The final item on the agenda was the report from the Culture 
and Islamic Art Commission concerning the research and 
investigation of the Haj and Pilgrimages Organization, which was 
read by the commission expert as follows: 
  After the report on the request for research and 
investigation of the financial resources of the Haj and 
Pilgrimages Organization by Mr. Bani-Hashemi, the respected 
deputy from Mashhad, the respected Majles approved the 
continuation of the research and investigation. The Islamic 
Guidance Commission appointed Messrs. Seyyed Kia'i-Nezhad, 
Seyyed Hashem Bani-Hashemi, Seyyed Ahmad Musavi, and 'Ali Zadsar 
to deal with the matter and to report the result. 
  The aforementioned council appointed Mr. 'Ali Zadsar as the 
group's chief. It then printed an announcement in the press 
asking everyone to send any documents or papers on this matter 
to the Islamic Guidance Commission. The resources for the 
research and investigation consist of: (1) resources from the 
public; (2) a careful study of the written documents and 
evidence; (3) statements from officials; (4) an inspection of 
the building; and (5) consideration of the views of the experts 
concerning the aforementioned resources. 
  It is noted: (1) no documents or evidence of any kind were 
sent to the commission by the people; (2) there were no 
telephone contacts or personal visits by any real persons or 
legal entities; (3) all the documents and financial evidence 
from the beginning to the end of the building's operation were 
studied and nothing negative of any kind was found; and (4) all 
the relevant documents, financial, planning, technical, bidding 
and other things are included in the report. 
  Detailed discussions were held with the respected 
representative of the vice regent for pilgrimage affairs and 
with the respected minister of culture of Islamic guidance, the 
respected chief of the Haj and Pilgrimages Organization, and the 
builders of the building, and all of those dear ones answered 
the questions from the members of the council and cooperated. 
  In a careful and lengthy inspection of the building all the 
members of the council learned the details and the quality of 
the building: 
  1 - The money to build the Haj and Pilgrimages Building was 
provided in the organization's annual budget, and was spent in 
numerous years after Majles approval. Therefore, there was no 
extra money, because the annual Haj and Pilgrimages surplus was 
deposited into the president of the republic's account and was 
spent as determined by the respected president of the republic. 
  2 - According to the views of His Holiness the Imam (peace 
be 
upon him), the Haj and Pilgrimages Organization sells the 
expenses of the pilgrimage to the pilgrims, meaning that the haj 
sales are final and not on account. Therefore it owns the money 
and will be authorized to spend it. 
  3 - With the registration of the respected pilgrims in the 
year 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985], R270,000 was collected 
from each pilgrim and they were sent in accordance with a 
timetable authorized by His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon 
him), and in this regard written documents were submitted. 
  4 - The construction of the building took almost 85 months 
and it cost almost R7 billion. According to the views of the 
experts and the value of money at that time, the price is 
appropriate. If exact numbers and figures are needed, the 
applicant may report to the Islamic Culture and Guidance 
Commission and see them. 
  5 - The construction of this great building was done with 
decoration suitable for the position of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, because Islamic Iran is the center of the Muslim world. 
  6 - The collection of the difference in the year 1372 and 
the 
sending of people who were not on the priority list was a bitter 
experience. The respected haj officials determined that they 
would declare plainly that as long as one pilgrim remained from 
the year 1363, they would not agree to any other motion or 
proposal and that they would reject the collection of 
differences, although the decision to collect the difference or 
not collect it is the decision of the government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, and if the government authorizes that such a 
thing be done, that definitely makes it possible. 
  In conclusion, with thanks to the officials, it is hereby 
announced that this report is late in appearing, but its 
submission was delayed because of the presence of the 1373 
budget bill on the Majles agenda. 
<H5>  Letter From More Than 158 Deputies Concerning Armenia's </H5>
Downing of the C-130 Aircraft 
  Respected speaker of the Majles: 
  With greetings and congratulations on the New Year to all 
compatriots, in the final days of the year 1372, when our 
compatriots were praying at the court of God and were hoping for 
peace, tranquility and stability in all the world, the hand of 
criminality came out of the sleeve of the deluded Armenian army 
and shot down a C-130 aircraft carrying the innocent families of 
Iranian diplomats, and as the merciless slaughter of the people 
of the Republic of Azerbaijan continued, it revived the habit of 
killing people and waging rebellion. 
  Therefore, with condolences to our dear compatriots, and 
especially the bereaved families, and with protest against the 
silence of the international organizations, especially the 
so-called Human Rights Organization, in the face of this air 
piracy by the army of Armenia, which is the main perpetrator of 
this open and terrifying crime in the Karabakh area, we demand 
an expeditious answer for these crimes from the Government of 
Armenia, and we demand that the Foreign Ministry of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran pursue this matter seriously.

them by government companies is prohibited. Also, any expansion 
of the organization of government companies in 1373 is 
prohibited. Banks, credit establishments, and insurance 
companies are exempt from the content of this paragraph.

  At the end of the Majles session yesterday afternoon, a 
resolution was issued. The resolution states: The sanctuary of 
love of the Friend of God was dragged in dust and blood with the 
hostile and malevolent fire of criminal Zionism, martyring a 
number of innocent worshippers and Palestinian strugglers. 
Undoubtedly, the passage of time will prove that the positions 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran are just. 
  Another part of this resolution states: We the deputies of 
the Majles reiterate the just position of the late Imam 
concerning the necessity of wiping Israel from the map of the 
world and, following the grand leader, announce that solving the 
problem of Zionism and removing this cancerous cyst is 
impossible except through continued armed struggle and the 
response with fire of the heroic fighters of Palestine to the 
hostile fire and crimes of Zionism. 
  It is interesting that about 140 deputies signed this 
resolution.

<H5>  Majles Notes </H5>
<H5>  Deputies Work Around-the-Clock on the 1373 Budget </H5>
  A special flurry of activity always arises among the 
deputies 
when the budget is being studied in the Majles, and they work 
very hard. Under the new Majles guidelines, this year the Majles 
is discussing revenues in the Joint Economic and Financial 
Affairs and Plan and Budget Commission. In the last two weeks 
the Plan and Budget Commission, as the main commission and the 
other commissions as secondary commissions, have worked very 
hard on the budget. 
  The Plan and Budget Commission has worked about 74 days in 
three shifts. In the final nights before the budget was 
presented to the Majles the discussions continued until dawn. 
Often when the Majles appeared to be in recess the commissions 
were active. Even during the 10 Days of Dawn celebration, when 
the Majles was closed for a week, all the commissions continued 
working, and the deputies submitted about 2,000 proposals to the 
Plan and Budget Commission. 
  During the period of studying the budget notes, some of the 
commissions worked very hard, presenting a special opinion about 
every row and contacting and consulting with experts from the 
Plan and Budget Organization and the relevant ministries. Here, 
after the Plan and Budget Commission, one may also mention the 
Agriculture Commission, for most of the recommendations and 
requests for change came from this commission. 
  Along with these positive characteristics, there are some 
points that cannot be easily passed over. One deputy told our 
correspondent: During the budget discussions and debates, a 
small number of the deputies do not pay enough attention to the 
nation's interests and the ceiling on commitments. They give 
priority to their own electoral districts. For example, with 
regard to the creation of power plants and new electrical power 
networks, they only consider their own regions as having 
priority and make recommendations for it. Another example is 
that the steel projects, which are being pursued in three 
provinces, are not needed by the country, and there is no export 
market for them either. It would be very appropriate if the 
deputies would only consider the nation's interests when 
submitting their proposals. 
<H5>  Dr. Kamran's Comments on the Answer From the Ministry of </H5>
Education and Training 
  Following the publication of the answer from the deputy 
minister for education in the Ministry of Education and Training 
to the comments by Dr. Kamran in the newspaper RESALAT on 
12/11/1272 [1 March 1994], he said in a contact with our 
correspondent: 
  What was said concerning the improper spending of credits 
from Note 55 had nothing to do with the Ministry of Education 
and Training. This organization has no specialist relationship 
with the Majles Islamic Art and Guidance Commission. The protest 
from the respected deputy minister of education in this ministry 
was beside the point. Also, this year organizations have also 
been approved by the commission under Note 55, which have a 
direct relationship with the Majles specialist commission.

projects may be met with funds from the general budget in the 
form of free assistance. The categories for the government's 
share in the free assistance and the subsidies on expected 
profits from the projects eligible for this aid will be 
determined by a committee consisting of the minister of energy, 
the chief of the Plan and Budget Organization, and the minister 
of economic and financial affairs. Every year the Agriculture 
Bank is required to use the funds obtained through the 
installment payments on the banking facilities obtained from the 
general budget for government investment in that bank. The 
executive guidelines for this note are to be prepared no later

Ministry of Energy, the Plan and Budget Organization and the

<H5>  Views of Some Deputies Concerning the Creation of New </H5>
Foreign Exchange Commitments 
  During a speech Mr. Nowbakht said: Paragraph B says the 
government is authorized to take steps by transferring existing 
foreign exchange commitments. We now have $8 to $10 billion in 
commitments to other countries. Isn't it reasonable for us to 
take another look at the nation's existing commitments and for 
those that are appropriate to be eliminated? Then we can carry 
out these important projects on which we are at the contract 
stage, such as Karun 4, on which we have advanced to the 
contract stage with the Japanese. 
  It is a contract with a very suitable profit rate whose 
payments begin after the project goes into operation, and the 
amount of the payments is quite small. They must also import the 
technology. If we implement this project alone, it needs more 
than 2.4 billion, while we have set aside only a total of 2.4 
billion for all four projects. 
  He then continued: This is not a new commitment. For 
example, 
in some commitments goods have not been imported, and even 
though they are not imported and no problem arises, we eliminate 
them. Therefore, all deputies desiring to limit commitments and 
improve on commitments must vote for it. 
<H5>  Engineer Nabavi's Views </H5>
  During a speech Engineer Nabavi discussed Nowbakht's 
remarks. 
He said: If Mr. Nowbakht had given an example of these potential 
commitments and purchases that were eliminated, we would have 
accepted what he said. These purchases go through various 
phases, and it is not practical to eliminate or convert these 
potential commitments. 
  In the same regard he added: Someone went and got a loan 
from 
the bank. He paid the profit on the loan and all the money for 
his imported goods. Now the banks are not willing to give this 
money back if should be willing to cancel these purchases. 
  Then there were efforts for several months to stop potential 
purchases, and so far there has been no result, and the 
likelihood of a result is quite small. Havardi made a list of 
things that could be stopped, but he saw that the goods have 
already been imported. 
  Therefore these new finances will be added to our foreign 
exchange commitments. 
  If we do not want our commitments to be more than 1.9 
billion, although these projects are quite important, due to the 
many commitments that have been made, instead of doing more 
financing and buy-backs, the emphasis has been laid on usance 
and short-term purchases, and now the country is in a situation 
with heavy commitments. Now that they are being refinanced, when 
these new loans come due in a few years it will be at the same 
time our refinance payments are due, and at that time we will be 
faced with about $20 to $15 billion in commitments that are due. 
Therefore these financing arrangements are being added to our 
foreign exchange commitments. 
<H5>  Mr. Mirvalad's Views </H5>
  Mr. Mirvalad, expert on the commission, discussed the 
creation of new foreign exchange commitments. He said: One of 
the most controversial issues discussed in our commission was 
this very Paragraph B, Note 29. The Plan and Budget Commission 
is fully aware of foreign commitments. We know that the very 
important projects must be implemented, and some of them have 
been written up as contracts. 
  The discussed the importance of these projects. He said: We 
agreed on two issues, one that the nation's commitments must not 
increase beyond a ceiling of $1.6 billion, and the other that 
these projects are very important and cannot be eliminated. The 
commission therefore authorized the government to transfer 
existing foreign exchange commitments until the end of the year 
1372. 
<H5>  Engineer Jalali's Views </H5>
  One proposal was to delete the phrase "and implementation of 
the project must be done so that the annual repayments on both 
the capital investment and related expenses be done after the 
project goes into operation" from Row 3, Paragraph B of Note 29. 
Concerning this, Mr. Jalali said: In this paragraph we did not 
make any request to increase numbers in terms of foreign 
exchange. This is merely the deletion of a phrase that creates 
problems with the implementation of projects to develop 
sugarcane. 
  He added: As you know, the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, signed by 117 nations, removes the subsidies on 
agricultural goods. Therefore, if we do not have the necessary 
investment for agricultural projects, in the not-too-distant 
future we will have to put all the nation's foreign exchange 
revenues into the crops the country needs. 
<H5>  Engineer Nabavi's Views </H5>
  Continuing, Engineer Nabavi spoke in opposition to the above 
proposal. He said: If we did not have the bitter experience of 
outstanding debts, there would be no problem for Mr. Jalali to 
be here defending the removal of this restriction. 
  He added: The repayments begin after operation begins. This 
is the minimum restriction that must be used. Otherwise, it is 
like the situation we are facing. That is, payments pile up and 
the country does not have the ability to make them and the 
country's political and economic prestige is lost. That is, you 
want them to go and make foreign commitments without 
restrictions or requirements, without any thought about paying 
them back when they come due. 
<H5>  Note 30 </H5>

<H5>  Majles Notes </H5>
<H5>  Engineer Bahonar's Answer to Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani's Comments </H5>
  The study of Note 39, especially Paragraph B, was 
controversial. Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani, attending the Majles as the 
government's representative, defended the new foreign exchange 
commitments given in Paragraph B, and in part of his speech, 
opposing the opponents, he said: "One cannot manage the country 
with slogans." 
  In a guideline memo, Engineer Bahonar asked permission to 
answer him on this point. During a speech he said: At the 
beginning of my speech I said: The government's performance in 
the economic sector in the First Five-Year Plan was something 
miraculous, and I believe in it. I said that these commitments 
are not significant numbers at all compared to our gross 
national product. I said the gentlemen are not taking one point 
into consideration, which is that the world magnifies our 
problems. They said we have turned the Bahai cemetery into a 
public park, and therefore human rights are not observed in 
Iran. If we owe a dollar in the country, they exaggerate it 
1,000 times. Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani said: "One cannot manage the 
country with slogans, we went and built bridges, roads and other 
things." We know all these things much better than he does. We 
have spoken and given speeches. We also have his belief, and in 
practice we have shown how steadfast we are and that we follow 
the government of Mr Hashemi and we support him. However, if we 
object to the performance of one or two organizations, this 
can't be called sloganeering (shouts of approval from the 
deputies).

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. 
After studying the notes for the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] national budget for five days, yesterday morning the 
Majles approved 85 budget notes. Likewise, yesterday afternoon 
the Majles studied the notes appended by the Majles commissions, 
which are presented below for our esteemed readers. 
<H5>  Majles Speaker's Remarks </H5>
  'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Majles, gave a short 
speech yesterday concerning International Jerusalem Day. He 
said: This year we are staging the Jerusalem Day demonstration 
at a time when right in the blessed month of Ramazan the 
children of Jerusalem and our dear Muslims were slaughtered by 
the Zionists right beside the chaste grave of the hero of unity, 
Ibrahim Khalil (peace be upon him), as they were doing their 
prayers and prostrations. 
  The speaker said the Jerusalem issue is not only for the 
nation of Palestine or the Muslim Arabs. Jerusalem belongs to 
all the Muslims of the world. The aggression and occupation of 
Jerusalem was aggression against the Muslim world. Therefore, 
the Muslim world must rise up to liberate sacred Jerusalem and 
liberate the foremost Muslim shrine from the usurper occupiers. 
  Of course, in the beginning world imperialism, criminal 
America, and the Zionists tried to view this issue as pertaining 
only to the Arabs and the Arab-Israeli war and to set up peace 
between the Arabs and Israel in order to continue the occupation 
and stabilize the Zionist government. Then they gradually 
lowered the issue from an Arab-Israeli issue to one involving 
only the Palestinians and Israelis. Recently they have limited 
it even more and have confined it to the al-Fatah organization 
and Israel, and finally, with the signing of the peace agreement 
with 'Arafat, they summarized it as the solution to the issue of 
the occupied territories. 
  In the same regard the Majles speaker said: I have often 
told 
these dear and great religious crusaders from the intifadah and 
the Islamic Jihad when they came to the Majles and we met that 
if, God forbid, they abandon the Palestine and Jerusalem issue 
one day, they must definitely know that we will not abandon it. 
For us the Jerusalem issue is one of aspirations and belief. 
  Nateq-Nuri explained that to liberate sacred Jerusalem all 
Muslims must arise. Continuing, he said: This year especially it 
should have become clear to the Muslims and the governments of 
the other Islamic nations that the nature of the ones seeking 
dominion is that if you take one step back, they will take a 
step forward and boldly continue with their crimes. 
  Continuing, the Majles speaker discussed the shameful 
Gaza-Jericho Treaty, the fact that Israel has not retreated a 
single step and the silence of the United Nations, the Security 
Council, and the supporters of human rights towards the 
slaughter of the Muslims of al-Khalil. He said: The Islamic and 
Muslim nations must adopt this as a basic thesis, acquire 
solidarity, and declare their anger at these terrifying crimes 
by attending the Jerusalem Day demonstration.

<H5>  Proposal To Eliminate Note 55 </H5>
  Some of the deputies proposed eliminating Note 55. Speaking 
in opposition, Mr. Nowbakht said: Last year during consideration 
of the budget, I had the honor of a visit with the exalted 
leader. He gave special emphasis to the fact that in the 1372 
budget we have an outstanding place for fighting the cultural 
invasion. 
  He added: This guidance caused the above note to be 
presented 
by the deputies. The blessings of this guidance were that in our 
responsible cultural organizations such as the Voice and Vision 
organization we have seen the start of the third channel, Payam 
radio, the province network and other things. In the Ministry of 
Education and Training we have 50 cultural societies, various 
video clubs, and special youth programs. 
  If we want to strengthen these organizations to fight the 
cultural invasion, if this note is eliminated, how can these 
credits be increased? 
  Continuing, Mr. Rahmani, speaking in support of the proposal 
to eliminate, said: The comments from the leader of the 
revolution were made under conditions when the budget was almost 
closed and was before the Majles. Really, when this year the 
government had the opportunity to include this note in the form 
of rows, why was it presented to the Majles as an item outside 
the program? On the other hand, should everything be spent in 
connection with cultural problems? 
  The expert from the joint commission then announced his 
opposition to this proposal. He said: Last year when 54 notes 
were approved in open sessions, a proposal was made by a group 
of deputies to the effect that Note 55 is for the purpose of 
fighting the cultural invasion. 
  The Plan and Budget Commission expected that this year when 
the government presented the budget it would not bring Note 55, 
but instead would provide the credits for this sector. We also 
believe that this budget writing is against the interest of our 
country. It is not appropriate for us to approve all the notes 
and then at the end to say that you should give 1 percent of the 
money for some other purpose. 
  The government representative also discussed the elimination 
of Note 55. He said: It is not sufficient reason that if we had 
a real budget-writing system we would be able to solve all the 
problems and this would also be solved. 
  Last year, for the purpose of defending the issue of 
opposing 
the cultural invasion and following the exalted leader, the 
Majles made a symbolic move, and it allocated a figure from all 
the budgets for this purpose. 
  He added: If we eliminate this note this year what will 
happen? Some projects that are half-complete will remain in that 
state. You who are speaking of elimination, what will the 
replacement be? After the completion of the remarks in favor and 
in opposition and the comments from the representatives of the 
commission and the government, the proposal to eliminate Note 
55, which was set in the budget to fight the cultural invasion, 
did not receive a passing vote. 
<H5>  Note 55 </H5>
  To fight the cultural invasion and alleviate deprivation, to 
make efforts towards the nation's self-sufficiency, the Credit

<F P=106> [Two-part article by 'Abbas Darvish Tavangar, "Experts Deal </F>
With the 1373 Budget Bill"] 
  [14 Mar pp 1, 16] 
  [Part 1] 
  [Text] The Majles procedure for dealing with the 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill can be studied from 
various perspectives. One can say that the Majles measures in 
this regard are unprecedented in the past 15 years. 
  The reduction in the expenses of the government and 
government organizations, the fight against ostentation and 
extravagance, better supervision over government and public 
organizations and companies, the emphasis on reducing foreign 
exchange commitments and the prohibition on increased prices for 
public goods and services can be considered the most important 
measures enacted by the Fourth Majles. 
  The implementation of the First Five-Year Plan plan was done 
with economic pressures on the low-income classes. Although 
these pressures came from investment in some basic 
infrastructure in Iran's economy, since sufficient measures were 
not taken beforehand to support the oppressed classes and no 
thought was given to fixed incomes, its continuation in the old 
way created many problems for the deprived. 
  Wage and salary increases did not keep up with inflation, 
and 
the most important law to support the consumer was never 
prepared for enforcement during this plan. 
  Without carefully assessing the effects and consequences of 
the decision to increase the prices of public goods and 
services, prices increased with or without the approval of the 
Economic Council. 
  Unfortunately, in some cases the reasons for these increases 
were not explained to the people. 
  The question is not whether these increases were the 
required 
amounts or were made carefully with consideration for the 
probable effects and consequences. The issue is, before these 
kinds of decisions are taken some thought must be given to 
supporting the oppressed and the poor, as the real owners of the 
Islamic revolution, and to preventing them from coming under 
pressure. It was on this basis that Note 25 in the budget bill 
was controversial among the Majles deputies. Ultimately, after 
debates and expert studies in the Majles, increases in the 
prices of oil by-products (such as kerosene, gasoline and gas 
oil) were rejected and raising the price of electrical power for 
96.3 percent of household consumers (up to 500 kilowatts) was 
accepted. The other items in this note were approved with 
adjustments. 
  Emphasis on reducing foreign exchange commitments in the 
year 
1373 is another of the characteristics of the budget bill 
approved by the Majles. Due to excessive imports, sometimes of 
consumer goods, and the emergence of a trade deficit, the 
nation's commitments increased. The lack of appropriate 
management for the aforementioned commitments created worries 
among the people, and this is the main cause of fluctuations in 
the prices of goods and services, and especially the foreign 
exchange rate on the free market. (1) By the end of the current 
year this situation led to about $30 billion in commitments, $15 
to $20 billion in debts and $10 to $11 billion in suspended 
debts for Iran's economy. 
  The exalted leader His Holiness Ayatollah Khamene'i 
emphasized: "taking the necessary measures for keeping the 
country away from foreign borrowing and efforts to break free of 
current commitments" (4) [as published] as one of the policies 
governing the compilation of the Second Five-Year Plan. In its 
study of the 1373 budget, the Majles gave attention to 
implementing the order from the exalted leader. The first 
measure the Majles took was to make budget approval a 
two-consultation procedure. Thus, more realistic revenue levels 
were approved and the amount of revenues from oil exports, which 
was set by the government at $11.84 billion, was reduced to 
$10.154 billion. In the second consultation, based on this same 
revenue level, government expenses came down. The designation of 
expenses at the level of approved revenues will not prevent 
other expenditures from taking place if the nation's foreign 
exchange revenues increase. 
  The second move by the Majles was to cut $1.6 billion out of 
the foreign exchange commitments at the end of the year 1373 
compared to the first part of this year, which was set in the 
government's bill at $1 billion. 
  The third move was that the foreign exchange reserves 
account, which was being kept at the Central Bank without 
authorization from the Majles, was put in order by the Majles 
deputies. It was decided that 15 percent of the revenues from 
the sale of oil would be deposited in this account at the 
official rate and would be used solely to pay foreign exchange 
commitments. Based on this measure, the government has no right 
to spend funds from this account except for this purpose. Of 
course other expenditures may be made with Majles authorization. 
Footnotes 
  [.sup]1.[/] Late in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 
1993] the rate for the dollar on the free market was 2,610 rials 
[R], and it increased to R2,700 by late in the current year. 
With Iran's agreements with Germany and Japan, this rate has 
dropped to R2,310 today. 
  [.sup]2.[/] Paragraph D, Note 11, Policies Governing the 
Second Five-Year Plan 
  [15 Mar pp 1, 16] 
  [Part 2] 
  [Text] The management of foreign exchange resources was not 
really done well during the First Five-Year Plan. Under the 
First Five-Year Plan authorization was given for up to $29.9 
million in new commitments for specific projects.[.sup]1[/] 
Although no definitive opinion can be given in this regard, 
based on the preliminary estimates, $10 billion and at best $15 
billion of the commitments created were in accordance with the 
designated projects under the Five-Year Plan. The Plan and 
Budget Organization has the definitive figures. Unfortunately, 
in violation of the law, this organization has not yet announced 
its report on the plan's performance[.sup]2[/] to permit 
documentation of the figures. 
  Therefore, the government did not intend to make $30 billion 
in commitments in every area, and the claim that the figure 30 
was deliberately chosen is correct, but its uses were not in 
accordance with the Five-Year Plan. Second, most of the 
outstanding debts are usance and short-term debt, although in 
the measures approved under the Five-Year Plan, usance purchases 
in this form were not to have taken place. 
  It must be noted that $10 billion in outstanding debt in an 
economy like Iran's, which has rich wealth, cannot cause 
problems. For this reason, the approach taken to this issue by 
the West is more political than economic. Many countries have 
several times the amount of debt that Iran has, but nothing is 
even mentioned about them. 
  In any case, the outstanding debts are something that 
happened in the past, but since this was not managed well by the 
Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs and the Central Bank, 
the problems came with it. 
  The reduction in government expenses and anchoring 
government 
companies can be said to be the most important characteristic of 
the 1373 budget bill. After the reduction in the oil revenues 
ceiling in the first consultation, which was necessarily 
followed by a reduction in government expenditures, some 
government organizations did not cooperate as required. Others 
took a position against this Majles decision.[.sup]3[/] At 
the same time the respected deputies, despite the lack of 
cooperation from some of the government's experts and 
representatives, themselves made new decisions concerning the 
government companies using expert studies, and one might be able 
to say that implementation of these revolutionary decisions in 
the government companies will become general.[.sup]4[/] 
  One of the problems with regard to these companies is that 
the real number of them is not given in the budget bills. By the 
end of the year 1371 [20 March 1993] 2,221 companies had been 
identified, of which 900 are clearly government 
companies.[.sup]5[/] Thanks to the inept management of the 
Plan and Budget Organization, the number of government companies 
was announced as being approximately 400 units.[.sup]6[/] The 
surprising thing is that even of this number that was confirmed, 
all did not submit their figures for inclusion in the budget 
bill. In the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget bill, of 
424 government companies, banks and profit-making institutions 
affiliated with the government, 284 units submitted their 
figures.[.sup]7[/] 
  Despite the fact that these companies draw from general 
revenues all of their profits are not deposited into the 
Treasury, yet their losses are imposed on the budget. Because 
the government and public companies have more privileges than 
other companies, one does not compete with them on equal terms. 
The law is not even enforced in many of these companies. The 
8,750 reports on failure to obey the law and the 1,066 
management violations in 1,567 companies and government and 
public institutions support this claim.[.sup]8[/] 
  Among the reasons there is a budget deficit every year is 
these very government and public companies. With their 
extravagance and ostentation, they impose the costs of their 
uneconomical management on the budget. The budget deficit was to 
have been reduced to zero in the year 1372, but this problem 
still remains. According to the preliminary estimates from the 
Plan and Budget Organization, by the end of the current year [20 
March 1994] the budget deficit will be R2,139.[.sup]9[/] If 
we add to this figure the R2,500 billion in Treasury imprest 
funds and the R3,400 billion in banking facilities these 
companies received, the scope of the problem becomes clearer. 
  In the 1373 budget the Majles made some very good decisions 
on government companies and public institutions. No matter how 
good the decisions are, however, if they are not implemented or 
if they do not have good executive officials, all the efforts of 
the Majles and the government will be wasted. Therefore it is 
considered necessary to deal with the violator, regardless of 
his rank.[.sup]10[/] 
Footnotes 
  [.sup]1.[/] These projects and the amount of their 
commitments consist of $10 billion in buybacks, $2.2 billion for 
petrochemical projects, $3.2 billion for the Pars gas fields, $3 
billion for the Karun 3, Jariani, Chahar Karkheh and Gavmishan 
dams, $1.5 billion for the Haft Tepeh, Karun and Kesht complexes 
and the sugarcane industries, $7.5 billion for investment in the 
1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] budget law and $2.5 billion 
to create added value through the construction of machinery and 
equipment to produce goods and implement domestic projects. 
  [.sup]2.[/] Note 34 of the First Five-Year Plan Law: The 
Plan and Budget Organization is required to exercise continuous 
supervision over the operations of the executive organizations 
and to submit a report to the government and the Majles 
commissions every six months concerning the progress of 
operations and their conformity with reaching the designated 
goals in the Five-Year Plan. 
  [.sup]3.[/] After the approval of the first consultation 
on the budget bill and the setting of a cap on revenues, Mr. 
Mohammad Khan, minister of economic and financial affairs, again 
asked the Majles to bring the 1373 budget into conformity with 
the government's bill (RESALAT 11/17/1372 [6 February 1994]). 
  [.sup]4.[/] Some of the decisions the Majles took with 
regard to the government organizations and companies were the 
requirement to submit a budget for 16 government and public 
companies to the Majles for approval, the prohibition on 
expanding the organizational facilities of government companies, 
the absolute prohibition on purchasing nonessential and 
nonadministrative supplies, the absolute prohibition on paying 
designated funds to employees working abroad, the prohibition on 
printing calendars, annuals and advertisements offering 
congratulations and condolences, the prohibition on buying or 
renting private aircraft, the prohibition on creating 
representative and administrative offices outside the country, 
the prohibition on using government vehicles outside office 
hours, and the prohibition on ostentation. 
  [.sup]5.[/] Report from the Supreme Supervision Council in 
the National Auditing Organization, Tir 1372 [22 June-22 July]. 
  [.sup]6.[/] Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani: The number of government 
companies is 400 units. Some 2,000 units have not yet been 
statistically proven for the government. (RESALAT 9/30/1372 [21 
December 1993]) 
  [.sup]7[/] and [.sup]8[/]. Report from the Supreme 
Supervision Council in the National Auditing Organization, Tir 
1372. 
  [.sup]9.[/] According to the latest estimate from the Plan 
and Budget Organization, the deficit in the general budget for 
1372 is R2,139 billion, an increase over the R1,077-billion 
deficit in the 1371 budget deficit. IRNA (RESALAT 12/18/1372 [8 
March 1994]) 
  [.sup]10.[/] In Part 1 of this editorial the price of the 
dollar at the end of the year 1372 was given incorrectly. The 
correct price is R1,610.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has said that a 
strong and stable economic development, self-reliance in energy, 
and population control are the three characteristics of the 
present government's economic policy for national development. 
Addressing a Karachi Stock Exchange award ceremony for top 
companies last night, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that on these 
three pillars depend the future progress and prosperity of 
Pakistan, and her government is moving to achieve these 
objectives. We have already announced an energy development 
program, which is expected to attract 700 billion rupees as 
investment over the next five years. Work has started on the 
Ghazi-Barotha project and difficulties facing the Hab power 
project have been removed. Power production in Pakistan will 
increase by 40 percent as a result of the two projects. The 
government has devised a program for setting up a 300-mw nuclear 
power plant with Chinese assistance and efforts are underway to 
remove the difficulties in the way of acquiring a 900-mw nuclear 
power plant from France. 
  The prime minister said the government has taken several 
steps to stabilize the country's economic infrastructure. 
Financial discipline has been introduced. Taxes on agriculture 
have been levied and bank borrowings, which stood at 62 billion 
rupees last year, have been brought down to 10 billion rupees. 
The State Bank has been made autonomous to free it from 
political pressures. Foreign exchange reserves have gone up to 
$1.8 billion. 
  Referring to the policy of privatization, she said the 
government would like to encourage it, but ensuring that public 
units are sold to the right persons at the right price. Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto said that her government is not afraid of taking 
unpopular decisions which are in the interests of the nation and 
long-term development. She said that she believed a long-term 
solution of our problems would ensure the prosperity of the 
nation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Kashmir Issue -- American Politicians' Tilt </F>
Toward India"] 
  [Text] Lee Hamilton, U.S. House of Representatives Foreign 
Affairs Committee chairman, has said that the UN Resolution on 
holding plebiscite in Kashmir has become obsolete and is a part 
of history now. At present, the chances for its implementation 
are remote, and one cannot even think about it. A practical 
solution to the Kashmir dispute would be to recognize the Line 
of Control as the international border. Addressing a seminar at 
the Asia Society on Indo-U.S. ties and ways to improve them, Lee 
Hamilton, who is regarded as an influential and powerful 
personality in Washington, made the above statement. Although 
the latest salvo fired by Lee Hamilton is totally against and in 
contrast to the American government's stance on Kashmir, it is 
not difficult to assess the policies of the most powerful group 
of American legislators, which they want to adopt in the 
subcontinent in future. The Indian lobby has been exerting 
pressure on this group for a long time. Lee Hamilton's 
statement on the plebiscite in Kashmir endorses Indian policy. 
In politics, the so-called elections, that made the late Shaykh 
Abdullah the puppet chief minister of the occupied valley, are 
described as a plebiscite. First, these elections were not held 
under the supervision of the United Nations but under the Indian 
Government. Secondly, Shaykh Abdullah also realized his follies 
later for which he had to undergo an imprisonment of 14 years. 
Lee Hamilton's point of view that the United Nations adopted 
the resolution on Kashmir at a time when India itself took the 
issue to the Security Council and pleaded for intervention does 
not hold good here. At that time also, the freedom fighters 
were continuing their struggle for independence, and there is no 
change in the situation now even after almost 50 years. Despite 
the stepped up Indian atrocities, the Kashmir freedom fighters 
are continuing their movement. There is no change in India's 
inclination, either. Therefore, terming those resolutions 
obsolete now is totally outrageous. 
  In South Africa, the minority whites ruled the local black 
population for three and half years [sentence as published]. In 
spite of that, the nations of the world did not accept it as a 
rightful government. As a result, not only the racist policies 
came to an end, but the African National Congress led by Nelson 
Mandela has also won a clear majority in the recently held free 
and fair elections there. If this principle of rejecting UN 
resolutions as obsolete is accepted, every aggressor country 
will try to keep the UN Resolutions under suspension until they 
become obsolete and become a thing of the past. 
  As far as the matter of recognizing the Line of Control as a 
permanent border is concerned, if the people of Kashmir were 
willing to endorse it, what was the need for them to continue 
the freedom struggle for such a long time, endure the Indian 
atrocities, and sacrifice their lives and property as well as 
dignity and honor? They did not tolerate the injustice for 45 
years to let India occupy Kashmir after reckoning the existing 
Line of Control as the international border. 
  The pleas made in favor of the laws of jungle by the 
distinguished politicians and scholars of the greatest human 
rights champion, the United States, in this era of liberty may 
only mean that wherever they want, they impose their ideology 
for personal gains. If the United States has decided not to 
grant the right of self-determination to the Kashmiri people, it 
should not resort to lousy arguments and should overtly state 
that India is right and all other countries are liars. 
  The authorities and the politicians in the United States 
have 
made India the regional don of South Asia and are bent upon 
denying the right of self-determination to the Kashmiris and 
making all the countries of the region, including Pakistan, the 
scion states of India. Therefore, this matter warrants a moment 
of thought from our government, politicians, and Kashmiri 
leaders. It is not only imperative on their part to intensify 
their campaign at global level, but the government also should 
make its lobby strong and effective in the United States.
