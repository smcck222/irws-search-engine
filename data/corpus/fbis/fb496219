<F P=106> [Editorial: "Superfluous 301"] </F>
  [Text] There are many reasons behind the U.S. decision to 
give India a two-month reprieve from the U.S. "Special" 301 
trade sword. One reason, perhaps, is the proposed Washington 
visit by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. The subject of the 
Washington talks is going to be the NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty]; the imposition of Special 301 on the 
eve of these talks would have been an unnecessary diplomatic 
irritant. In addition, India and the United States hold 
divergent views on a number of issues. Questions about 
political-strategic issues are more serious than trade 
questions. All of this is going to be discussed by Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao and President Clinton. Therefore, it is 
impossible to understand why the U.S. Commerce Department 
brandished the Special 301 sword. Agreed, the previous 
two-month reprieve has just ended. Meanwhile, the official GATT 
accord has been confirmed, and India has signed it. The GATT 
preamble answers all the questions the U.S. Congress cited in 
proposing the Special 301 act. India's acceptance of the GATT's 
Dunkel draft should satisfy the U.S. Administration, and it 
should be thinking about ending Special 301. To the contrary, 
however, the United States has threatened to bring India under 
the purview of Special 301. 
  It seems that India must face Special 301 again because of 
China. China is going to become a GATT member; it has already 
applied. China had made an issue of the delay in approving its 
application. Until China joins the GATT agreement, the U.S. will 
continue to threaten it over U.S. patent and copyright issues. 
China and India are in the same category on the U.S. list. 
Therefore, India is being warned time and again because of 
China. Perhaps it is because of China that the U.S. Congress is 
not thinking about revoking Special 301, despite the GATT 
signing. China, India, and Argentina are the countries 
currently being threatened with Special 301. India and Argentina 
have already signed the GATT agreement. As a result, they must 
make changes in their patent and copyright laws in accordance 
with this agreement. GATT has allocated enough time for this. 
The United States is applying psychological pressure on them to 
enact new laws quickly by giving two months' warning. If India 
ignores this, nothing is going to happen. India should not care 
about Special 301 anymore. After all, why should the United 
States be accepted as a godfather in place of the new 
multilateral trade organization? All patent and copyright 
issues are now the concern of the new trade organization. How 
can the United States become a godfather in bilateral trade when 
a multilateral trade system is being launched? Perhaps the U.S. 
Administration refrained from applying Special 301 because it 
has a proper understanding of this perspective, and the Indian 
Government did not waste any time reacting to it.

  [Text] India has conveyed its disappointment at the Iranian 
ambassador's statement after his visit to Jammu and Kashmir. 
The ambassador, Mr. (Reza Sheikh Akhtar), was summoned to the 
foreign office in New Delhi to convey India's reaction to his 
statement. An External Affairs Ministry spokesman said in New 
Delhi that it was not the Jammu and Kashmir government which put 
any hurdle but the Hurriyat Conference leaders themselves in 
arranging a meeting with the Iranian ambassador. He said the 
European troika ambassadors and others, who visited the state, 
appreciated India's transparent policy on Kashmir and their 
reaction was positive.

  [Text] In South Africa, the African National Congress 
continues its sweep in the recently held elections. The party 
has secured 65 percent votes which is 1.7 percent less than a 
two-thirds majority. The ruling National Party has polled 20.6 
percent votes, while the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom Party 
has secured 8.1 percent. As the celebration party which began 
on Last Friday [29 April] still continues, the formal election 
of Dr. Nelson Mandela as the next president has been postponed 
to Monday. The postponement is due to the delay in counting of 
votes. About 100 world leaders are expected to attend the 
installation of Dr. Mandela as the first Black president of 
South Africa. The Indian delegation to the installation 
ceremony will be led by the vice president, Mr. K.R. Narayanan. 
The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman 
Khurshid, spoke to our correspondent Prabhat Dabral on the 
changing scenario in South Africa. 
  [Begin Khurshid recording] I think that tremendous... 
[pauses] I think it opens up vast new field of economic activity 
for Indian entrepreneurs and Indian traders. It really 
virtually opens up the Indian Ocean. We were too far from many 
destinations because we didn't have a major trading partner on 
the tip of Africa. Now we have. If we exploit this potential, 
if we work together in partnership, a whole new opportunity 
opens up not just in Africa itself, but beyond Africa [words 
indistinct]. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Muwaf faq Zaydan] </F>
  [Excerpt] Peshawar--Informed Afghan sources told AL-HAYAH 
yesterday that a deepseated difference of opinion had broken out 
between President Borhanoddin Rabbani and his foreign minister, 
Hedayat Amin Arsala, after the latter refused to respond to 
presidential instructions that recalled him to Kabul on 21 
March. The foreign minister visited the Central Asian republics 
last week on what Rabbani described as "a personal visit that 
does not represent the state." 
  This difference of opinion resulted from statements made by 
Seyyed Ahmad Gilani, the leader of the Mahaz-e Melli-ye Eslami 
[National Islamic Front], to which Arsala belongs. Gilani, in 
his statements, criticized Rabbani's steps to extend his 
administration, which ends in June according to the Islamabad 
agreement and the Mecca pact between the mojahedin groups. 
  The relationship between Rabbani and Gilani became more 
tepid 
after the latter received a delegation of the coordination 
council opposed to Rabbani's rule in light of news about 
attempts by the opposition side to convince Gilani to join its 
ranks. 
  The opposition, led by Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, 
seized the opportunity at rapprochement with Gilani after the 
president's steps to dismiss the Afghan ambassador in Islamabad, 
Dr. Mohammad Roshan. It is well known that Roshan also belongs 
to Gilani's front. 
  Sadeq Tashkari, the Afghan president's aide, told AL-HAYAH 
that Engineer Mokhtar is the ambassador's charge d'affaires. 
However, Roshan has not left the embassy and has refused to 
answer Rabbani's demand for his recall to Kabul in order to 
appoint him to the post of director of consular affairs in the 
Foreign Ministry. The opinion of observers is that if Gilani 
secedes from the Rabbani alliance, the latter may suffer a major 
blow since it would not leave anyone in his alliance other than 
the Ettehad-e Eslami led by 'Abd-Rabb Rasul Sayyaf, with some 
remaining neutral and the rest in the ranks of the opposition. 
  Mas'ud Khalili, one of the commanders of the Jam'iat-e 
Eslami 
(led by President Rabbani) who lives in Kabul, comment on the 
subject. He told journalists, "This is a strange situation. It 
is up to the Gilani group to define its position. Is it still in 
the alliance or has it left?" Khalili did not comment on whether 
Kabul had appointed a new foreign minister or not. 
  In addition, artillery battles continued between the 
opposition and government forces in the Afghan capital yesterday 
in which 70 people were wounded. [passage omitted]

Iraq have said that the head of the ruling regime in Baghdad has 
dismissed Sabir 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Duri, the director of his 
intelligence services, after the exposure of the culprits in the 
assassination of the Iraqi dissident Shaykh Talib Suhayl 
al-Tamimi in Beirut, and the involvement of the Iraqi regime's 
intelligence services in the killing of German journalist Lissy

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Clashes in Northern Iraq Between </F>
Barzani's and Talabani's Fighters"] 
  [Text] London -- A dispute over land ownership in the area 
of Qal'at Dizah north of the Iraqi Kurdish city of 
al-Sulaymaniyah has led to clashes between gunmen of the two 
main Kurdish parties, namely the Kurdistan Democratic Party 
[KDP], led by Mas'ud Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan [PUK], led by Jalal Talabani. The battles extended to 
cities and villages in three of the four Kurdish governorates. 
  Sources of the two parties agree that the fighting, which 
started on 1 May, stopped yesterday, leaving an unspecified 
number of casualties, both dead and wounded. 
  The two parties' sources, contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
yesterday, said that the leaderships of the two parties and 
figures from other Kurdish parties and Iraqi Arab opposition 
parties succeeded in stopping the fighting which had started in 
the Qal'at Dizah area near the border with Iran in the wake of a 
tribal dispute over land ownership between individuals with 
split political loyalties to the two parties. Relations between 
the two parties have been characterized by rivalry and 
sensitivity, and at the end of last year they formed a joint 
command to avoid armed clashes between them and to coordinate 
their supervision of the local government which they formed and 
in which they shared influence for the past two years. 
  Statements issued by the two parties yesterday said that 
clashes occurred between their peshmerga forces in the main 
cities of al-Sulaymaniyah and Dahuk and also in the city of 
Raniyah in the extreme east and in Zakho in the extreme west 
near the border with Turkey. 
  The European branch of the KDP distributed an appeal for an 
end to the fighting by its leader Barzani the night before last. 
It said: "Despite the very serious aggressions against our 
party in Qal'at Dizah, Raniyah, and al-Sulaymaniyah in recent 
days, as the future of our Kurdish people faces a most serious 
threat, and to prevent any further appalling tragedies, I call 
on all parties to remain calm and to stop the fighting 
immediately." He also called for a meeting of the Kurdistan 
Front which is an alliance of Kurdish parties, in existence 
since 1988. That meeting was supposed to take place yesterday. 
  According to sources from both sides, the political bureaus 
of the two parties held a joint meeting in Barzani's presence 
but in the absence of Talabani, who is in Italy. They issued a 
joint appeal to their forces and supporters calling for the 
immediate cessation of fighting, the release of the detainees 
from both sides, and the return of the gunmen to their bases and 
camps. But a statement issued by the PUK said that the fighting 
spread to Dahuk and Zakho after that appeal was made. The PUK 
statement urged forces of both sides "to stop the military 
operations immediately and not to allow any new eruptions."

  [Text] Reports from Irbil have said that large-scale armed 
clashes erupted in the past three days between Mas'ud Barzani's 
group and Jalal Talabani's group. The clashes began in the 
districts of Raniyah and Qal'at Dizah. Both parties used 
various kinds of weapons, and many people were killed or wounded 
on both sides. A number of innocent citizens were killed, and 
their houses were demolished. 
  Fighting extended to the city of al-Sulaymaniyah, killing or 
wounding many people. The situation in al-Sulaymaniyah 
resembles a state of curfew. Detachments from both sides 
erected control points on most roads in and outside 
al-Sulaymaniyah. Many residents of al- Sulaymaniyah left their 
homes and fled to adjacent areas in the belief that they are 
more secure. 
  In the Dahuk governorate, Mas'ud Barzani's group occupied 
the 
headquarters of Jalal Talabani's group in all towns in Dahuk, 
Zakho, al-'Imadiyah, and 'Aqrah, detaining their residents and 
impounding their weapons. 
  In the governorate of Irbil, both sides yesterday exchanged 
fire in Shaqlawah, the district of al-Siddiq, and Hajj 'Umran. 
People who fled the area said that despite the calls made by 
the cliques of saboteurs to halt fighting, there is still 
continuous shooting between the two sides. The leaders of 
saboteurs failed to address the situation, which was coupled 
with cuts in the electric power and drinking water as well as 
burglaries and looting of citizens' homes and properties.

  [Text] After recent clashes between the Kurdistan 
Democratic Party [KDP] of Iraq and the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan [PUK], which resulted in many casualties among the 
forces of the two sides and the innocent people of the region, 
and despite the agreements between the officials of the two 
mentioned parties to refrain from attacking each other's 
offices, today the PUK forces, led by Jalal Talebani, captured 
the towns of Shaqlawah, (Panjbeyn), and Chamchamal. 
  On the other hand, many Barezani tribesmen, affiliated to 
the 
KDP, led by Mas'ud Barezani -- under the name of Barezan Corps 
-- cleared the town of Salah ad Din from the PUK and captured 
the PUK television station that covered the area.

  [Excerpts] Baghdad, 6 May (INA) -- The newspaper 
AL-THAWRAH has said that if Mrs. Tansu Ciller's government 
fulfills its promises to Turkish merchants to reopen border 
posts in order to carry out trade with Iraq, this will be a 
decisive development in favor of sound Iraqi-Turkish relations. 
  In an article today, AL-THAWRAH, mouthpiece of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party, expresses confidence that fulfilling the 
promises made by Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin 
would be positively and quickly reflected in various sectors of 
the Turkish economy, which has been suffering from serious 
defects and obstacles since the blockade was imposed on Iraq in 
1990. [passage omitted] 
  AL-THAWRAH says that if Mrs. Ciller's government fulfills 
its 
promise to reopen the al-Khabur border post, then the way will 
be open for the Turkish economy to acquire the same privileges 
attained during the prosperous trade exchanges with Iraq. These 
exchanges used to refresh not only Turkish areas adjacent to 
Iraq but all of Turkey as well. This was achieved by pumping 
Iraqi oil into Turkish markets and promoting trade and economic 
activities along the path of the oil pipeline, in addition to 
supporting the Turkish lira, expanding the scope for businesses, 
and establishing dozens of joint Iraqi-Turkish ventures and 
firms.

<F P=106> [Report by Jalal al-Mashtah: "Russia Agrees To Write Off 80 </F>
Percent of Syria's Debts"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- AL-HAYAH learned yesterday that Moscow has 
agreed to write off 80-90 percent of the debts Damascus owes to 
it. Gulf states will pay the remaining sums, provided that $500 
million worth of Russian military equipment is purchased and 
paid for in cash. 
  A source close to the premiership office told AL-HAYAH that 
an agreement to this effect was reached during the recent visit 
to Damascus by Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister and 
head of the military-industrial complex in Russia. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that the agreement, whose details have 
not been revealed, stipulates Russia's agreement to write off 
80-90 percent of the debts accumulating from previous contracts 
with the Soviet Union and then Russia. These debts are 
estimated at more than $10 billion. Two Gulf states are 
expected to pay the remaining sum, which it is believed will be 
transferred to the Central Bank of Russia, which will finance 
the purchase of Syrian commodities to be exported to Russia as a 
means of paying the debts. 
  It has also been learned that the agreement provides for the 
purchase of military equipment worth $500 million to be paid to 
Russia in cash. Moscow considered this step "a new chapter" in 
relations between the two countries. Details of the military 
agreement have not been revealed. However, it is understood 
that Moscow "took account" of concerns conveyed to President 
Boris Yeltsin by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who urged 
the Russians not to sell to Damascus aircraft the Israelis 
regard as "a disruption of the security balance." 
  It is also understood that the Russians pledged not to 
implement previous contracts, especially with regard to 
exporting spare parts for weapons the former Soviet Union had 
supplied to the Syrians. 
  A Russian expert familiar with details of the agreement 
stressed that it could cause "embarrassment" for Moscow when 
dealing with other indebted countries. He mentioned in 
particular Iraq, Libya, and Yemen. He said that these countries 
could demand a similar treatment and the writing off of part of 
their debts, which he estimated at about $20 billion.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] A state of anxiety and mourning has spread 
throughout the occupied Arab territories and a state of 
rejection prevailed for the signing of the agreement 
implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord. Cities, villages, and 
townships in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip witnessed a 
complete closure as a sign of rejection of the plans to 
liquidate the Palestinian people's cause and squander their 
legitimate national political rights. All this shows that the 
Cairo agreement does not express this people's will and does not 
fulfill their national and pan-Arab aspirations. 
  This agreement has come as a natural result of the Oslo 
agreement which stipulates the perpetuation of the occupation, 
and Israel maintaining its control over the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  There is no doubt that the agreement to implement the 
autonomy rule that Rabin and 'Arafat signed in Cairo yesterday 
will have many complications, dangers, and harmful dimensions 
for the Palestinian people and their cause, and will have 
complex ramifications not only on the state of affairs in the 
occupied Arab territories but also on the state of affairs in 
the entire region. In addition to the fact that the self-rule 
agreement does not give the Palestinians any prerogatives or 
responsibilities in the fields of defense, foreign affairs, and 
political affairs, it also makes the Palestinians dutybound to 
protect the security of the Israeli settlers and others. It 
also gives the Israelis the final say in deciding who who enters 
and leaves the self-rule territories, stipulates that the 
Israeli army will keep its complete control on the settlements, 
and that instead of withdrawing, the Israeli forces will 
redeploy and control roads, bridges, and passageways. 
  Looking at all this, one realizes that this agreement does 
not in any way whatsoever constitute a step on the road to peace 
but further complicates the peace process and saves Israel from 
a burden under which it nearly collapsed in view of the 
escalation of the intifadah. Many Israeli officials admit that 
the signing of the self-rule agreement has guaranteed a partner 
for Israel and for its security and that a security alliance has 
been established between the PLO and Israel to confront and 
terminate the intifadah. 
  By firmly and angrily rejecting the self-rule agreement, the 
Palestinian people reaffirm that they will never give up the 
goals for which they launched their intifadah against the 
occupation to completely eliminate it from their occupied 
territories. This is because they realize that any partial 
solutions, phased settlements, or partial deals cannot but be in 
the interest of Israel and its occupation and not in the 
interest of their national rights and that of rergaining them. 
  All indications show that the wrath which spread throughout 
the occupied Arab territories while 'Arafat was signing the 
agreement is the best proof that Israel has dragged the 
Palestinian party into potentially dire consequences and to more 
concessions which first started with the Oslo agreement, 
continued to be made over a period of seven months, and finally 
resulted in a flimsy agreement that is not in the interest of 
the peace process, that gave Israel many gains, particularly in 
the security field, and that transformed the Palestinian police 
force into tools to protect the occupation and the settlements. 
  We in Syria want just and comprehensive peace and have never 
accepted and will never accept separate and amputated solutions. 
We cooperated and will cooperate for the sake of such a peace. 
Only a just and comprehensive solution will bring about a 
viable peace that will be accepted by the people, that will 
last, and that will safeguard the dignity and interests of all 
the parties.

  [Text] Amman, May 6 KYODO -- Jordanian Prime Minister and 
Foreign MInister al-Majali said in talks Thursday [5 May] with 
Japan's Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa that Jordan will 
cooperate with the Middle East peace process. Majali, meeting 
Kakizawa for an hour and a half in Amman, described the recent 
peaceful developments as a "new era" in the peace process, 
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Palestine 
Liberation 
Organization (PLO) leader Yasir 'Arafat on Wednesday signed a 
historic agreement on limited Palestinian self-rule for Gaza and 
Jericho. Majali said Jordan is taking the basic line that it 
will comprehensively negotiate with Israel over bilateral 
disputes including border and water feuds, the officials said. 
  The West Bank, including Jericho, had been under Jordan's 
jurisdiction, but was occupied by Israel in 1967 and Amman 
renounced its sovereignty there in 1988. 
  Majali reiterated Amman's support for Japan's bid to gain 
permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council, the 
officials said. 
  Kakizawa pledged to al-Majali that Japan will grant a 13.14 
billion yen loan to Jordan to help finance energy programs, 
after a lapse of three years since Tokyo granted a 700 million 
yen loan, they said. The Japanese minister exchang268460096 a 
memorandum with Jordanian Planning Minister Ziyad Fariz about 
Japan's grant in aid worth 400 million yen to help increase 
Jordan's food production, they said. 
  Kakizawa also visited Jordanian King Husayn, who said Jordan 
should negotiate with Israel over the West Bank in light of the 
signing of the self-rule accord, the officials said. Earlier in 
the day, Kakizawa visited the West Bank town of Jericho, a day 
after he attended the signing ceremony in Cairo of a historic 
agreement on limited Palestinian self-rule for Gaza and Jericho. 
He visited a local hospital in Jericho to which Japan has 
offered to supply medical equipment. Kakizawa is visiting 
Jordan during a tour of the Middle East which has already taken 
him to Egypt and Israel.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husyan and His Highness Crown 
Prince Hasan received Egyptian Prime Dr. 'Atif Sidqi and his 
delegation today. Dr. Sidqi extended his condolences to his 
majesty and the Jordanian family over the death of Her Majesty 
the late Queen Mother Zayn. They then discussed developments in 
the peace process and stressed the urgency for policy 
coordination among the Arabs to further the cause of a just and 
comprehensive and lasting peace in the region. They also 
underscored the need to coordinate economic policies, given the 
changes sweeping the region, particularly in the economic area. 
Under such circumstances, Arabs must exchange views in all 
areas to advance economic and social conditions and, by 
extension, regional peace and stability. The meeting was 
attended by Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, Royal Court 
Chief al- Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, and the Jordanian-Egyptian 
ministerial committee members. 
  His majesty gave a statement to the Egyptian media team, 
visiting with Dr. Sidqi: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] How does 
your majesty see future cooperation with Egypt? 
  [Husayn] There is a wide scope for that. I was happy to 
learn about the subjects that the joint committee addressed. I 
think the two sides are determined to further our cooperation 
and integration. I am impressed by the resolve the parties have 
shown to attain our joint objectives for our common good. 
  [Correspondent] How does your majesty feel about recent 
developments, particularly with reference to the peace process? 
  [Husayn] Our position is clear and has been so since 1974. 
We recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of 
the Palestinian Arabs. Thanks be to God, the PLO is doing its 
job advancing the objectives of our Palestinian brothers and in 
this effort it has our full support. We hope the recent 
developments will before long yield positive results and advance 
the rights of the Palestinians on their national soil. 
  [Correspondent] Are you in touch with President Mubarak over 
the Jordanian-Israeli track? 
  [Husayn] Our coordination to advance the cause of a just and 
comprehensive peace that future generations can live with is 
ongoing. I hope we will have further meetings in Amman and in 
Egypt, our second homeland, so that we may work together for the 
good of our people. 
  [Correspondent] What kind of contribution will Jordan make 
to the consolidation of the self-rule authority? 
  [Husayn] We are doing what we can to help our kinsfolk and 
brothers. Of course, Jordan is in a special position in terms 
of its association with the cause and the kinsfolk. Also what 
is going on will have an impact on Jordan. I think that the 
same largely holds true for Egypt. President 'Arafat is 
visiting us today; we hope to find out what we can do to help 
out. [end recording] 
  Dr. 'Atif Sidqi spoke to our political affairs 
correspondent: 
  [Begin Sidqi recording] This is not the first time that I 
have met with his majesty the king. His majesty is a first-rate 
statesman in global, as well as in regional terms. I am 
impressed by his astuteness, experience, and familiarity with 
the ins and outs of Arab and world issues. We talked at length 
about regional developments and the peace process. He is as 
firmly committed as we are in Egypt to the peace process. We 
look forward to that process yielding out benefits for all the 
states of the region. We also discussed bilateral relations, 
which, thank God, are good, even though it is some time since 
the joint committee last convened. However, work had not really 
stopped as we noted at today's committee meeting. His majesty 
pronounced himself fully satisfied with the relations between 
Egypt and Jordan and the committee's work. He urged that we 
keep up the work to further these relations. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Developing a Fruitful Cooperation Away From </F>
Slogans"] 
  [Text] Amidst the blizzard of the tempestuous political 
events in our region these days, an important event like the 
resumption of the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Committee meetings 
seems like a peaceful island in a turbulent sea. This picture 
is strengthened by the fact that the meetings are being held in 
Amman away from slogans, fancy promises, and pan-Arab programs. 
Instead, these meetings are discussing and studying economic, 
trade, scientific, and cultural issues, including the 
establishment of joint ventures between the two fraternal 
countries, in an atmosphere of seriousness and close examination 
out of the limelight. 
  In fact, this kind of bilateral Arab cooperation, which 
touches various parts of the economic and trade life, is not 
receiving enough attention by Arab observers. It has always 
been the practice, and our life is governed by practices, to 
hail only political developments, without paying any attention 
to events and developments that affect Arab citizens' daily 
life, despite the fact that any meaningful political changes or 
developments have economic contexts that affect the lives of 
Arab citizens. 
  Within this context, the resumption of the Joint Jordanian- 
Egyptian Committee meetings following a five-year hiatus is 
truly an important development in relations between the two 
fraternal countries and in inter-Arab affairs. Such a 
development will naturally have a political impact resulting in 
further rapprochement, cooperation, and coordination between 
Amman and Cairo. 
  Although these meetings focused their discussion and study 
on 
economic, trade, scientific, and cultural cooperation issues, 
political issues were not absent. This was made clear yesterday 
in the two lengthy speeches by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al- Majali and Jordan's great guest, Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 
'Atif Sidqi. The two speeches were marked with an objective 
view of the Arab nation's reality and a sincere desire to 
overcome the state of fragmentation, end differences, and direct 
greater attention to the ties of bilateral cooperation between 
the various Arab countries. 
  Although it is clear that both Jordan and Egypt are facing 
difficult challenges and economic and political pressures here 
and there, that reality in particular provides the motive to 
develop bilateral ties, taking inspiration from the mutual 
interest of the leaders of the two countries, His Majesty King 
Husayn and His Excellency President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, to 
bolster these ties within the context of mutual respect and to 
develop the existing opportunities of cooperation and to explore 
further opportunities.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin says American 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher will return to the region 
in the middle of the month, because he is convinced peace can be 
achieved between Israel and Syria. Beilin told reporters in Tel 
Aviv that Christopher received a detailed Israeli proposal 
representing official thinking on the nature of the settlement. 
He had received the Syrian reply, which was very different from 
Israel's proposal, but was sufficiently detailed to envisage a 
common denominator between the two sides, he said. Beilin also 
said there was no serious prospect of development between Israel 
and Syria without American intervention. 
  Referring to the agreement with the PLO, Beilin stressed 
'Arafat's biggest test would be the manner of the entry of the 
Palestinian police and 'Arafat's ability to stand up to the 
opposition against him. Israel would not agree to any PLO 
agreement with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] enabling 
Hamas to operate outside the autonomy, because it would be a 
violation of the agreement.

  [Text] Sources in Washington believe that U.S. Secretary 
of State Christopher's willingness to mediate between Israel and 
Syria practically ends the previous modus operandi for 
negotiations in Washington between December 1991 and the Hebron 
massacre [in February 1994]. 
  An Israeli source in Washington has said that, in the peace 
package offered to Syria, Israel did not promise a full 
withdrawal, nor did it offer a withdrawal from Majdal Shams 
first. The terms the Syrians used in their reaction to the 
Israeli proposal contained more concrete terms than in the past 
regarding the definition of peace and normalization. The 
Syrians have gone from using general terms such as 
demilitarization to using numbers, according to the source.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gad Yaacobi, ambassador to the United </F>
Nations, in New York, by correspondent Jon Snow, in London; from 
the "Channel 4 news" -- live] 
  [Text] [Snow] Ambassador, do you see this accord today as 
the beginning or the end. 
  [Yaacobi] Yes, it is the beginning of the end of a process 
which may lead towards reconciliation and comprehensive peace in 
the Middle East. But it is not a time for celebrations, it is a 
time for realization of the implementation of the agreement. 
And the Palestinians are facing the main challenge -- to be in 
charge of their lives and the municipal and civilian affairs of 
their people in the territories. 
  [Snow] Do you think you've done it soon enough for the PLO 
to be those Palestinians in charge? 
  [Yaacobi] Yes, I believe that we did it in a very 
accelerated way. Within three weeks the implementation will be 
over and at that time the Palestinians will take over and I 
believe that this will be perhaps the end of the conflict 
between the two peoples that has lasted for 100 years in 
general, but for the last 27 years, since the six-day war. 
  [Snow] Now, two other very important ingredients to the 
global Middle East peace -- Jordan and Syria -- have both said 
that this accord will not lead to a wider peace in the Middle 
East. They've both condemned it. 
  [Yaacobi] I am sorry to hear it because I think that Jordan 
supported the whole move for a very long period of time. One 
day after the Declaration of Principles was signed in Washington 
DC, Israel signed with Jordan the agenda for peace which 
included a mutual agreed agenda to make progress toward a peace 
treaty between Jordan and Israel. But I agree with those who 
think that this is not enough. First of all, we have to 
implement this agreement, and the main task is that of the 
Palestinians. 
  Secondly, we have to conclude positively the negotiations 
between Israel-Syria, Israel-Lebanon, and Israel-Jordan. And we 
know very well that Syria is a key state in the whole peace 
process in the Middle East. And following a peace treaty 
between Israel and Syria -- I believe that it is the only option 
that the two states are having -- then of course other states 
and neighboring Arab countries will join the peace process with 
Israel and hopefully it will be within the next year. 
  [Snow] Well, sitting where you are in New York, briefly do 
you see the Syrians actually concluding something within in the 
next year? 
  [Yaacobi] We would like to see them doing it, because we 
believe that this is the only way that the Syrians can achieve 
their goals, which means having back some of the territory of 
the Golan Heights, doing peace with Israel, developing resources 
from the conflict into the economy and the society, and 
communication and housing, and the same is relevant to Israel. 
We are willing to build a new Middle East and a new future for 
our people. This is what the whole story is about. 
  [Snow] Ambassador, thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Report by parliamentary correspondent Gid'on Alon and ITIM] </F>
  [Excerpts] In reaction to the Israel-PLO accord signed in 
Cairo, representatives of all the opposition factions yesterday 
decided to submit a bill to disband the Knesset and hold new 
elections within 100 days. [passage omitted] 
  Some time before the Israeli-PLO signing ceremony in Cairo, 
opposition faction leaders held a special news conference, at 
which they sharply attacked the government. Knesset Member [MK] 
Binyamin Netanyahu, chairman of the Likud, said this was a dark 
day for the state and one of the lowest points in the history of 
Zionism. "In an hour, Rabin will be able to declare that he has 
founded the Palestinian terrorist state in Cairo," Netanyahu 
said. He maintained that the government has kept none of the 
pledges it had made on the eve of the Knesset elections: not to 
negotiate with the PLO and not to permit the establishment of a 
Palestinian state. He stressed that this government did not have 
a popular majority, just as it did not have a mandate to give up 
the Golan Heights. According to him, the government was carried 
by a tiny majority of PLO supporters in the Knesset, and during 
its term in office, the citizens' personal safety had suffered 
unprecedented deterioration. 
  Netanyahu noted that it was the opinion of IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] elements that rather than decline, the scope of 
terrorist activities would rise in the near future. He added 
that terrorist organizations might mutually agree to carry out 
attacks in new locations, and that their Gaza and Jericho squads 
might carry out attacks on Israeli territory. 
  The Likud chairman stressed that the opposition factions had 
decided to launch an extensive public campaign against the 
creeping withdrawal and against the terrorist state's expansion 
up to the outskirts of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. "We want to 
prevent this cancer from spreading and to put an end to this 
inept government's fraudulence. We plan to stage demonstrations 
and protest vigils, and to obtain the signatures of 500,000 
citizens in support of the call for early elections," Netanyahu 
said. He voiced his confidence that the opposition factions' 
public struggle would be crowned with success, thereby 
relegating the present government into history as a passing 
episode; and that idea of a Palestinian state would fail, 
because the government was incapable of uprooting 120,000 
Israeli settlers in Judaea and Samaria. [passage omitted] 
  Later in the day, opposition leaders reacted to the ceremony 
at which the Israel-PLO accord was signed. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that "Rabin's series 
of concessions ended at a public degradation ceremony. Suffice 
it to see with whom Rabin signed the agreement to understand the 
nature of the agreement and the nature of the government that 
signed it." 
  MK Refa'el Eytan, the Tzomet chairman, said: "In Cairo, 
Rabin signed orders launching Israel's second war of 
independence, a war sure to be ferocious. The faltering that 
accompanied the signing proves that the unknown far exceeds the 
known. If the agreement is not stopped in time, it will lead to 
a Palestinian state whose final goal is the annihilation of the 
State of Israel." MK Eytan added that like the other opposition 
factions, Tzomet demands that the Knesset be dispersed and new 
elections held within 100 days. 
  MK Zvulun Hammer, the National Religious Party leader, said: 
"The prospects offered by this agreement are not on par with the 
vast risk that national security will be endangered and with the 
damage caused by a profound national rift." He asserted that a 
Palestinian state was being served on a platter to the same 
terrorist organizations that made merry with the blood of our 
sons and daughters, while a majority of the nation are hurting 
and sorrowful, apprehensive and distrustful, feeling completely 
insecure and unsafe as a result of the blurred facts and vague 
reality painted by the government. 
  Commenting on the agreement, MK Rehav'am Ze'evi, chairman of 
the Moledet movement, said: "Acting as if we were the ones who 
lost wars, the Israeli prime minister today signed the writ of 
surrender to the head of the PLO gang. This day will be 
remembered in our national history as a dark day, a landmark on 
the Jewish state's way to perdition and voluntary suicide. Yet 
we have not lost hope, and we will be again lords of this land 
when this government of coercion and annihilation is defunct and 
we become a free nation in our own country." 
  "This is a dark day, a day of humiliating surrender to our 
enemies and murderers, a day on which a mistake for which we 
will have to pay with blood was made," former Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Shamir said yesterday afternoon. "What they did today 
is worthless, without any value; it wastes time and strengthens 
our enemies, whom we could have defeated by now," MK Shamir 
added.

<F P=106> [Report by David Regev] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Great concern over the PLO 
request to delay the transfer of powers was voiced yesterday by 
members of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] top echelons. 
Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, the chief of staff, has recently 
stated in a cabinet meeting that a delay in the IDF withdrawal 
from the Strip is liable to provoke radical elements, who 
realize they have nothing to lose, to carry out terrorist 
attacks against IDF targets. A senior officer said yesterday: 
"On the one hand, we must start cooperating with the 
Palestinian police, and on the other, to pursue antiterror 
activities." 
  The chief of staff and the Central Command commander have 
instructed IDF commanders to pursue their ordinary operational 
activities. And indeed, a long series of operational activities 
was carried out during the past week, including the capture of

bus close to the village of Biddiya on the Trans-Samaria 
highway. No one was hurt and there was no damage. South of

hurt. 
  A Qol Yisra'el reporter says throughout the day there were 
disturbances in the Hebron, Jericho, and Tulkarm areas. 
Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse stone 
throwers. 
  The center of Hebron was open yesterday to commerce and

<F P=106> [Report by Daniyel Aviv, Shlomo Dror, and ITIM] </F>
  [Excerpts] Rallies against the peace agreement signed in 
Cairo were yesterday held in Ashdod, Jerusalem, Qiryat Mal'akhi, 
and the Valleys District. 
  Dozens of right-wing supporters gathered in the early 
morning 
hours in the Ashdod junction and blocked traffic. The 
demonstrators carried placards denouncing the peace process, set 
tires on fire, and some stoned cars driven by territories 
residents on their way to work in Israel. Massive police troops 
were summoned to the junction, and three demonstrators were 
taken in for questioning. [passage omitted] 
  Terror victims' relatives staged a demonstration opposite 
the 
prime minister's residence in Jerusalem yesterday afternoon. 
The police made sure that the demonstrators stayed on the 
sidewalk near the prime minister's residence, and the protest 
ended in relative quiet. 
  Another demonstration was held near the Hebrew University on 
Giv'at Ram last night. Several dozen demonstrators carried 
torches and placards denouncing the agreement; two tires were 
burned. One of the demonstrators, who had probably set the 
tires on fire, was detained by policemen. 
  No unusual events were reported yesterday in East Jerusalem, 
with the exception of a partially observed commercial strike. 
Beefed up police deployed throughout East and West Jerusalem 
all day yesterday to deal with disturbances. 
  About 1,000 inhabitants of Qiryat Mal'akhi and the adjoining 
towns yesterday rallied in the Qastina junction at the approach 
to Qiryat Mal'akhi protesting the government plan to permit 
Palestinian traffic from Gaza to Jericho to cross through Qiryat 
Mal'akhi. [passage omitted] 
  Other rallies protesting the agreement were yesterday held 
in 
the Golani, Tzemah, Bet She'an, and Habiq'a junctions. The 
rallies were organized by Golan Heights settlers. Some 50 
people gathered in the Golani junction and attempted to set 
tires on fire and block traffic. The police prevented the 
demonstrators from blocking traffic in all the junctions. 
  [Reporting on page A6 of the same issue of HA'ARETZ, Amnon 
Yosef adds: "Hundreds of settlers from the Qatif Bloc and 
northern Gaza Strip settlements yesterday participated in a 
rally at the Neve Deqalim settlement, protesting the agreement 
with the PLO. In all the Qatif Bloc settlements, schools 
remained closed and settlers did not go out to work."]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dan Margalit: "Self-Made Impasse"] </F>
  [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin has chosen the wrong way to defend 
the wise agreement he made with Yasir 'Arafat. In a television 
appearance, he ridiculed Menahem Begin, saying that his ceremony 
at Camp David was not marred by an incident like that 
orchestrated by 'Arafat in Cairo because Begin gave everything 
to Anwar al-Sadat, whereas Rabin was not so generous toward 
'Arafat. 
  Why should Begin be derided? Faced with giving in to U.S. 
pressure and going for the chance of peace with Egypt on one 
hand, or caving in to the rage of the settlers and extreme 
right-wing demonstrations in the territories on the other, Begin 
decided to uproot the Sinai settlements, and this was a 
reasonable decision. 
  Rabin already knows that the establishment of the Qatif Bloc 
was an act of political madness on the part of former Labor 
leaders. He would prefer it to be abandoned, because the 
presence of the settlers in the Gaza Strip increases unnecessary 
friction in this test period of neighborly relations between the 
two nations. The prime minister, however, still lacks the 
courage to tell the settlers that the refrain "do not uproot 
what has been planted" is only a prayer and not an expression of 
hard political reality. 
  It is true that it is hard for any Zionist to uproot trees 
or 
fences. But this myth must not blind us to reality: Even 
during the period that all Israeli ideologues like to invoke 
nostalgically, settlements were dismantled on the Golan and in 
the Galilee. Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the spiritual father of all 
right-wing ideologues, opposed the establishment of Tel Hay [a 
settlement in upper Galilee stormed by Arab attackers in 1920]; 
Yosef Trumpeldor had to die before Jabotinsky adopted his name 
for his own newly formed youth movement [BETAR, Brit Yosef 
Trumpeldor]. 
  There is a serious contradiction in Rabin's attitude toward 
this issue. On one hand, he had the courage to tell the United 
Kibbutz Movement that in exchange for peace with Syria, he will 
disband settlements on the Golan; on the other, he refuses to 
explain why this logic should not apply to the Gaza Strip as 
well. 
  If it is possible to disband Merom Golan, it should also be 
possible to relocate Kfar Darom. Were it not for Rabin's 
obsessive stubbornness, which prevents him from relocating any 
settlements even a few meters away, many issues could have been 
solved without planting an explosive device right in the middle 
of the festive Cairo ceremony. The maps with the problematic 
attached signatures are, to a large extent, the result of a 
settlement concept that forced the two sides to put the solution 
of the problems off to a later stage. Have we forgotten the 
Taba affair, which placed so many obstacles on the path of 
Israeli-Arab diplomacy, before being solved with a clear victory 
for the Egyptians? 
  Rabin's adamant refusal to soften his position regarding 
some 
of the settlements raises serious doubts about his confidence in 
his ability to insist on issues he really considers paramount -- 
perhaps even that of the 'Etzyon Bloc, which he considers 
absolutely vital. The prime minister is afraid that he will not 
be able to keep this bloc of settlements intact. As a result, 
he is entangling himself in a self-made impasse regarding all 
the settlements, both the vital and the insignificant ones. 
  Rabin's adamant position regarding the settlements has hurt 
the Oslo and Cairo agreements, because it is a mistake to leave 
a large Jewish population in the Gaza Strip under physical and 
psychological conditions that are a breeding ground for Jewish 
terrorism. It is also a mistake to insist on leaving Na'ama in 
its present location, because this makes it difficult for Israel 
to evince even modest generosity regarding the size of the 
Jericho autonomous area. 
  The stubborn decision to keep these settlements in their 
present location fails to placate the turbulent right wing in 
any event. The right wing considers the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
"the beginning of the Palestinian people's redemption," and if 
this is indeed the case, it is regrettable that the government 
is denying instead of confirming it. Does Shim'on Peres really 
reject the establishment of a Palestinian state in the Gaza 
Strip with a federative link to the West Bank and Jordan? 
  I believe it is high time the government admitted this 
reality. All the ministers, however, refuse to acknowledge this 
possibility. This will force them to again fall back on Peres' 
fertile imagination to produce another original and helpful -- 
albeit partial -- solution. It is reasonable to assume that in 
the near future, Peres and 'Arafat will raise the possibility of 
a mini- interim arrangement in the framework of which another 
city and town will be transferred to Palestinian authority every 
three months. Qalqilyah, Janin, Nabulus, and Qabatiyah, and 
another year will have passed.

  [Excerpt] Information Minister Michel Samahah has said that 
the media law will be passed in the next few weeks. In a 
wide-ranging interview with the United Arab Emirates newspaper 
AL-KHALIJ, which will appear tomorrow, Samahah discussed the 
upcoming regional tour by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, security issues and government concerns in Lebanon, 
and various other issues. 
  Samahah said that Christopher's tour is neither a positive 
nor a negative development insofar as negotiations are 
concerned. What matters to us, Samahah added, is UN Security 
Council Resolution 425, the implementation of which would pave 
the way for our wider participation in the general Arab talks 
involving Resolutions 242 and 338. 
  The information minister added that Lebanon will see 
Christopher's tour as significant if the latter were to bring 
with him something new that calls for direct communication with 
the Lebanese Government, such as information concerning 
Resolution 425, its mechanism, and the timetable for its 
implementation. Otherwise, Lebanon will see nothing new in 
Christopher's tour. 
  Samahah said that once Israel commits itself to withdrawal 
beyond the international borders, Lebanon will be ready to 
discuss arrangements concerning the withdrawal phase, deployment 
of the Lebanese Army, and control of the occupied territories. 
The information minister added that the illegitimate presence 
in the south will have to withdraw with the Israeli withdrawal. 
  Concerning the media, Samahah said that the television and 
radio law will not be late in coming and is expected to be 
passed within the next few weeks. He said that the law will 
guarantee freedom of thought and expression and the public's 
access to information. In return for which, there are 
obligations that the law will address. The media should not be 
used to foment sectarian hatred or undermine the unity of 
homeland and its national symbols. 
  Samahah called on the media to return to being the Fourth 
Estate. The media, he said, should be free from political and 
financial manipulation. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Vienna, 5 May (KUNA) -- Austrian economic and 
trading circles have received warnings from Kuwait that the 
contacts between certain trading and industrial companies in 
Austria and other European states and the Iraqi regime may have 
a negative effect on the future of cooperation between Kuwait in 
particular and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries in general 
with those companies. 
  A well-informed Austrian source told KUNA here today that 
Kuwaiti officials have expressed deep concern over the contacts 
between some Austrian companies and a delegation from the Iraqi 
Ba'th Party which visited Austria recently under the leadership 
of former ambassador 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, the director of 
foreign affairs in the Ba'th party. 
  The source also said that Kuwait is closely following these 
contacts and officials consider that "the relevant Austrian and 
other European companies are in breach of the international 
sanctions imposed on Iraq" at a time when the Iraqi regime is 
not committing itself to implementing the UN resolutions as a 
condition for lifting the economic sanctions imposed on it since 
it occupied Kuwait in 1990. 
  Kuwaiti officials do not rule out the possibility of 
interrupting cooperation with those companies if they continue 
their contacts and cooperation with the Iraqi regime before it 
implements all the UN resolutions. [passage omitted]

following statement: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is following 
with great sorrow the continuing fighting between the brothers 
in brotherly Yemen. In the interests of the brothers in Yemen,

  [Text] Riyadh, May 5, SPA -- Saudi papers on Thursday 
cautiously welcomed the agreement signed on Wednesday [4 May] 
between the PLO and Israel on the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho peace plan. 
  The Jeddah-based, AL-MADINAH, said despite reservations on 
some parts of the agreement, the agreement means that a new 
phase has begun for practical and realistic actions. While many 
people think that the agreement is full of deadly mistakes and 
bears seeds of failure, the paper said, other people thought it 
will fulfill the ambitions of the Palestinian people of the 
occupied territories who suffered too much from unemployment and 
poverty that makes the Palestinian side to soften its 
negotiation stand. 
  AL-YAWM, of al-Dammam, said the agreement does not 
necessarily mean that all standing propblems had been solved 
because Israel, with a record full of manipulations and 
deception, many not carry out the agreement honestly. The paper 
urged the international community and big powers in particularly 
to guarantee full implementation of the agreement and called on 
the Palestinian to realise the biggest possible gain of the 
agreement. 
  AL-JAZIRAH, published in Riyadh and 'UKAZ, published in 
Jeddah also tackled the same issue said the agreement would be a 
real test for the intentions of Israel and whether it is ready 
to cope with the Arab position on peace process. They said if 
the agreement is not followed by similar progress on other 
tracks, it would certainly expose to erosion elements and 
matters may change for the interests of peace opposing parties 
in the region.

  [Excerpts] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has 
stated the following: In continuation of the scenario prepared 
by the gang of al-Ahmar, whose bloody appetite was stimulated 
after the aggression against the 3d Armored Brigade in 'Imran, 
this bloody gang of al-Ahmar, which thirsts for blood and 
devastation, at 8:15 tonight began to attack the Martyr Ba 
Suhayb Brigade Camp in Dhamar town. This daring brigade, in 
these decisive historic moments, is waging a fierce war against 
the enemies of the homeland and is confronting with bravery, 
death, and defiance the mercenaries of the adventurist gang of 
al-Ahmar. [passage omitted] 
  While the Defense Ministry deals with this crime, it assures 
the masses of our Yemeni people that it will remain loyal to the 
pledge by individuals of our armed forces to protect our people 
and their national and democratic options. In these historic 
moments, it calls on all the honorable sons of our people, the 
heroes of their Armed Forces and the generous forces to stand 
united to confront this imminent danger to the homeland and its 
unity, and inflict defeat on the bloody gang of al-Ahmar. Our 
people are lying in wait for them.

  [Excerpt] Dubai, May 5 (AFP)--Heavy gunfire broke out 
around Yemen's presidential palace in Sanaa early Thursday and 
rival northern and southern forces bombed the country's two main 
airports in Sanaa and Aden. 
  Diplomatic sources contacted from the United Arab Emirates 
said a plan to evacuate Western nationals could be put into 
action later in the day. 
  No southern units are normally deployed in the capital, but 
a 
Western diplomat was unable to say whether the gunfire round the 
palace of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was between factions of 
the northern troops. 
  One source said Sanaa airport had been closed to air traffic 
after being bombed by southern warplanes but that "the runway 
was usable." 
  Anti-aircraft guns blazed into action in Sanaa as southern 
fighter planes loyal to Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid dropped 
bombs in a raid on government buildings and the radio and 
television centre there, an AFP correspondent there reported.

<F P=106> [Unscheduled statement by Yemeni military source at the </F>
Defense Ministry and General Staff Commands on 5 May -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
With the help of God and the resolve of brave men, the units of 
valiant Armed Forces--the forces of unity and constitutional 
legitimacy--in the Lahij, Abyan, al-Bayda', and Ta'izz 
Governorates continue their confrontations and successive 
offensives against the units of the forces of evil, wickedness, 
and apostasy, which have been controlled and commanded by the 
rebellious, separatist elements in the Socialist Party command 
since they exploded the military situation in a comprehensive 
manner last night, beginning with the Dhamar and Aden 
Governorates, and extending to other governorates. 
  The forces of constitutional legitimacy--the defenders of 
unity and democracy--have inflicted successive defeats on all 
the units that have been pushed into this losing and destructive 
battle. They forced a large number of those forces to surrender 
to the will of the people, the power of truth, and the heroism 
of the forces defending unity and democracy. Other units have 
surrendered of their own free will, declaring that they have 
joined the trenches of constitutional legitimacy and the ranks 
of the defenders of the people and the homeland and their great 
achievements. 
  This morning, units from the Ba Suhayb Brigade Camp were 
forced to surrender and join the ranks of constitutional 
legitimacy and Yemeni unity. 
  With the same spirit of defending unity and democracy and 
defeating the forces of treachery, apostasy, and separation, the 
forces of the 2d Armored Brigade in the al-Rahah area continue 
their great steadfastness, warding off all the fires of rancor, 
which will be defeated, God willing. 
  In the al-Bayda' and Abyan Governorates, the forces of the 
56th Brigade, 3d Armored Brigade, the 8th Special Forces 
Brigade, and the al-Wahdah Brigades continue their determined, 
capable advance as they confront the forces of separation in the 
Mukayris area. They encircled and seized the 20th Brigade and 
all its fortifications. 
  In the same spirit aiming at bolstering the people's unity 
victory and defeating their treacherous enemies, the supported 
[muda'am] 3d Infantry Brigade confronted the forces of apostasy 
and separation in the camps of the al-Rahidah and Sarif areas. 
They are now continuing their heroic and valiant advance to 
achieve their mission. 
  In the city of Aden, our valiant heroes at the Central 
Security Company in Khormaksar have continued their unique 
heroic steadfastness in the face of the fierce large-scale 
aggression carried out against them by a number of the rebelling 
military units. 
  In the Ibb Governorate, the forces of the constitutional 
legitimacy and Yemeni unity have continued their attack on the 
units and brigades of the forces of apostasy and secession in 
the al-Dali' region. The forces of the al-Hamzah Camp inflicted 
heavy losses on the 'Abbud Brigade forces. Fighting is still 
raging and the treacherous ones, aggressors, and those rebelling 
against the constitutional legitimacy, of the enemies of the 
people and unity, will receive their punishment. 
  Ever since last night, the al-'Amaliqah forces have been 
heroically confronting the sea and air attacks against them in 
the Abyan Governorate. They were able to repulse these attacks 
and prevent them from achieving any of their objectives. 
  This morning, the capital, Sanaa, and the cities of Ta'izz 
and al-Hudaydah witnessed air raids by the aircraft of the 
rebelling secessionist forces, which targeted some vital and 
strategic installations. These raids also targeted a number of 
the military brigades in some governorates. The units of the 
air defense forces confronted them and downed two aircraft 
belonging to the rebelling secessionist gang in the al-Rahah 
region, two aircraft in Mukayris, and another aircraft in 
al-Rahidah. 
  Last night and this morning, large numbers of officers, 
noncommissioned officers, and soldiers willingly handed 
themselves over to the forces of the constitutional legitimacy, 
announcing that they want to join these forces, and voicing 
their rejection of the despicable secessionist conspiracy which 
was hatched by the secessionist gang in the leadership of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], headed by war criminal, traitor, 
'Ali Salim al-Bid and his evil secessionist clique, against the 
homeland and its unity, and against the people, their freedom, 
and democracy. The expressed their denunciation of all the 
criminal acts which resulted in this comprehensive military war 
which was ignited by this rebelling clique, which will be 
crushed, God willing. 
  In a subsequent statement, we will detail the names of these 
units and the number of the officers, noncommissioned officers, 
and soldiers who joined the forces of the constitutional 
legitimacy and the trench of the Yemeni unity, the party of the 
one Yemeni people, which is above all the sick parochial, 
personal, and selfish loyalties, because it is the people's army 
whose loyalty is to God, the homeland, the revolution, the 
unity, and democracy.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Defense Ministry source at the Defense </F>
Ministry on 5 May -- read by announcer] 
  [Excerpts] In continuation of the bloody events by the 
adventurist gang of al-Ahmar family, this bloody gang exploded 
the military situation in numerous areas and positions with the 
aim of launching our people and their armed forces into a 
crushing all-out war. This followed the iniquitous aggression 
by the forces of the Republican Guard, the Central Security, and 
the military police against the martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade Camp in 
Dhamar town where this daring brigade confronted, with rare 
heroism and outstanding bravery, the multitudes of these 
aggressive forces and inflicted a crushing defeat on them. 
  At exactly 9 o'clock on 4 May, a unit of the Central 
Security 
carried out an act of aggression against Sawlaban Camp and an 
attack on Aden international airport in an attempt to occupy it 
or destroy it. However, this attempt quickly failed. Our 
forces managed to settle the situation quickly in their favor, 
and the battalion of military police refused to obey the orders 
of Sanaa to fight against their brothers, the sons of all the 
Yemeni people. All the battalion's members joined our forces. 
[passage omitted] 
  And in a dangerous development of the military and political 
situation, the adventurist gang in Sanaa resorted to using 
military aircraft. The citizens of Aden this morning were 
surprised by a pair of warplanes attacking Aden international 
airport, but our vigilant air defenses confronted this attack 
which did not achieve any success worth mentioning. 
  In response, our fighter aircraft attacked Sanaa, Ta'izz, 
and 
al-Hudaydah airport, paralyzing these airports to stop them from 
being used by this (?reckless) gang in its bloody criminal acts 
against our people. While the Defense Ministry decisively 
confronts the adventurist acts of the bloody gang of al-Ahmar 
family, it notes with extreme gratification that many members of 
our armed forces and units who are under the control of the 
Sanaa gang, have refused to fight against their brothers. 
Another large number joined our forces who are defending unity 
and democracy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA) -- A number of former Yemeni 
ministers and officials have called on President Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak to exert more efforts to save the Yemeni people of the 
current infighting. 
  Addressing their plea also to the leaders of Syria, Saudi 
Arabia, Jordan, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as 
the Arab League secretary general, the former officials said 
that the strife in Yemen is a result of misjudgment, 
miscalculation, and ill-advised policies. 
  'Abdallah al-Asnaj, former Yemeni foreign minister; Qasim 
Bin- 'Ali al-Wazir, former member of the Advisory Council; Major 
General 'Abdallah Juzaylan, former deputy prime minister; a 
former finance minister; a former agriculture minister; and a 
member of the Ta'izz Popular Congress, all of whom are currently 
in Cairo, signed the plea. 
  The Yemeni officials pointed out that Yemen is sinking in a 
bloodbath and that prudent intervention is needed to contain the 
crisis.

  [Text] The parliamentary bloc of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] issued a statement in which it expressed its regret and 
resentment over the statement issued today by the House of 
Representatives which represented the secessionist congress and 
al-Islah blocs, and has no connection with the Constitution. 
The statement said that the House of Representatives is to be 
used to justify the war declared by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the 
motives of which hide the secessionist lenience [as heard] of 
the forces which rejected the convention document and the 
national dialogue, and instead declared the war by attacking a 
number of brigades in the northern governorates. 
  The statement said that the declaration of the war by 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and his military dynasty, supported by the House 
of Representatives, is a disaster to our people. The statement 
declared the boycott of the meeting of the House of 
Representatives and suspended the membership until it rectifies 
its stand.

<F P=106> [By Abdelrahmane Haidari] </F>
  [Text] Sanaa, May 5 (AFP) -- Civil war broke out in Yemen 
on Thursday [5 May] between rival northern and southern forces, 
with warplanes bombing airports and government buildings and the 
president declaring a state of emergency. 
  France decided to evacuate its citizens from the country, 
which was united only four years ago and whose rival leaders 
from the old North and South Yemen have been in dispute since 
last August. 
  A southern air raid on Sanaa airport lit the fuse, prompting 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner, to order a 30-day 
state of emergency to counter "separatist" forces based in the 
southern port city of Aden. 
  The airport was closed to civilian airliners, while a 
northern raid on Aden airport also forced its closure. 
  A northern military spokesman later said all-out fighting 
erupted between rival troops in the seven main provinces, all on 
or near the border which used to divide the country at the 
southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. 
  Five southern warplanes were shot down, he said, quoted by 
the official news agency Saba'. Southern troops had suffered 
heavy losses in the clashes at Lahij, Abyan, Ta'izz, al-Bayda', 
Dhamar, Aden and Ibb. 
  There was no immediate casualty toll. 
  Tanks and troops patrolled the streets of the capital, as 
panic- buyers swamped the shops and many families packed up and 
headed for the countryside in trucks loaded with mattresses and 
boxes. 
  Later as night fell, more anti-aircraft fire was heard over 
Sanaa. The streets were totally deserted of civilians and the 
city was hit by an electricity black-out. 
  Salih and his vice president, 'Ali Salim al-Bid have been in 
dispute for eight months on the running of the country created 
when former North Yemen and the poorer, Marxist south unified on 
May 22, 1990. 
  A reconciliation accord they signed in Amman on February 20 
failed to ease the tension, with al-Bid calling for 
decentralization and series of military, political and economic 
reforms. 
  A diplomat, contacted by telephone from the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE), said there had also been heavy gunfire around 
Salih's palace. 
  Southern planes bombed the government headquarters and a 
radio and television centre in a dawn raid, witnesses said. 
Anti-aircraft guns shot down one of the planes, which crashed 
in southern Sanaa in a black cloud of smoke. 
  Witnesses said northern forces were quick to take their 
revenge, destroying the Sanaa headquarters of al-Bid's Yemen 
Socalist Party, and tanks had been positioned on the rubble. 
  The Italian embassy next door was also damaged. 
  US special envoy Robert Pelletreau met Salih to express his 
country's support for the "unity and democracy" in Yemen, Saba' 
said. 
  The US state department on Wednesday proposed a plan for the 
warring factions to separate their forces, agree to halt 
redeployments, establish better communications and reestablish 
dialogue. 
  In Paris, the foreign ministry said France was evacuating 
all 
its nationals from Aden because of the fighting and would help 
any other foreigners from European Union countries. 
  About 60 French nationals live in Aden, the foreign ministry 
said, but it could not specify how many other Europeans were 
there or in Yemen overall. 
  The French government earlier ordered its forces at its 
major 
base in nearby Djibouti to prepare for the possible mass 
evacuation of foreigners. 
  In London, the Foreign Office called for the rival Yemeni 
chiefs to "reengage urgently a dialogue." 
  Britain has not ordered its people out of Yemen but said 
they 
could take advantage of the French evacuation if they wanted. 
The 800 Britons, most of whom work in the oil industry, should 
"keep their heads down." 
  Britain was the colonial power in Aden until quitting in 
1967 
after much bloodshed. 
  Airports in the towns of Ta'izz in the south and al-Hudaydah 
in the west also came under attack Thursday from southern planes 
but were not hit, the defence ministry said. 
  Clashes have also been going on since Wednesday between 
northern and southern units in Dhamar, about 100 kilometres (60 
miles) south of Sanaa, in Aden and in Redfan in the north. 
  A southern unit was reportedly wiped out by northern troops 
in fighting overnight in Dhamar. 
  Tension was also running high in Abyan, to the east of Aden 
and in Shabwah where the majority of the country's vital 
oilfields are based. 
  Last week, fighting broke out in the town of 'Imran, north 
of 
Sanaa, killing 79 people, according to official northern 
figures. Other reports spoke of more than 200 dead. 
  Yemen's giant northern neighbour Saudi Arabia appealed 
Thursday for its leaders to "put the national interest" above 
all others and halt the escalating fighting, as Egypt joined in 
calls for an end to the bloodshed. 
  A plane carrying Arab League mediators was unable to land 
because of the bombing of the capital's airport, league 
secretary general 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid said in Cairo. 
  The rival army forces in Yemen, which each have about 30,000 
troops, have never been merged and the country has been plagued 
by tribal and political feuds. 
  Each side is supported by rival tribes, which are 
well-equipped and can together raise forces of about 100,000.

Sanaa--live or recorded] 
  [Text] Political and military sources have reported to us 
that the fighting has extended to the areas of Ta'izz, Abyan, 
al-Bayda', and Aden. Also, warplanes belonging to the Yemeni 
Socialist Party carried out air strikes against Sanaa, Ta'izz, 
and al-Hudaydah, as well as the airports and vital targets in 
the three towns. 
  Fighting is still raging. Various types of air force and 
ground weapons are being used by the two sides. Meanwhile, calm 
returned to Dhamar after the surrender of the Basahib camp and 
the joining of its troops to the northern forces. 
  Seven military brigades belonging to the north are now 
advancing toward Aden to tighten their control on it. The MBC 
team is at this very moment in the Sanaa television building and 
southern warplanes are flying over to attack the building. 
Antiaircraft fire is intercepting the raiding planes.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, received at his office 
today, Robert Pelletreau, U.S. assistant secretary for Near 
Eastern Affairs, who conveyed to the brother president a message 
from the U.S. Administration dealing with bilateral relations, 
fields of cooperation, and issues on interest to both friendly 
countries, in addition to the current developments in our 
country. 
  During the meeting, the two sides reviewed the means of 
promoting bilateral relations and expanding fields of 
cooperation. They also discussed the situation in our country 
in light of the explosve military situation which was caused by 
the secessionist forces rebelling against the constitutional 
legitimacy, particularly some members the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] leadership, who seek to fragment the homeland and involve 
the sons of our Yemeni people, their Armed Forces, and security 
forces, in the furnace of fighting. 
  The U.S. assistant secretary expressed the United States' 
support for unity and democracy in our country, and its concern 
about all the challenges facing it as a result of the crisis. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman expressed his 
regret and deep sorrow over the regrettable events in our 
country as a result of the aggressive and adventurous actions by 
the secessionist elements of the YSP leadership which has 
obstinately rejected all good efforts and endeavors to contain 
the crisis and have caused a comprehensive military explosion. 
  The brother president praised the United States' stand and 
support for the Yemeni unity, democracy, and free economy 
approach. He noted that our people greatly appreciate this 
stand. He stressed our country's concern about promoting its 
relations with the United States in the interest of both 
friendly countries. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman said that the main 
concern for the sons of our Yemeni people and their leadership 
is to build a new Yemen, the Yemen of 22 May 1990, which is 
based on democracy, unity, political and economic freedom, 
social justice, comprehensive development, respect for human 
rights, the planning of institutions, and the building of the 
state of law and order. 
  Attending the meeting were Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah and U.S. Ambassador in Sanaa Arthur Hughes.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Blessed be the forces of unity 
and constitutional legitimacy as they storm the strongholds of 
the apostasy and secession and destroy the ramparts of treason 
and treachery. Blessed be the forces of unity and the army of 
legitimacy, which is the shield of great, unified Yemen and the 
hand flying the banner of faith and honor. Having plotted, the 
apostate and secessionist forces have received the reward for 
their plotting. But the plotting of evil will hem in only the 
authors thereof. [Koranic verse] The gangs of apostasy and 
secession have betrayed the homeland, disavowed pledges, and 
violated agreements. Therefore, it was inescapable that they 
receive the wrath of the God and the people and that they 
receive the reward of treachery and treason from the forces of 
the people and the heroic army of unity. 
  The people and the entire world have heard the decisions and 
statements of the Yemeni leadership and the the Defense Ministry 
and General Staff Command official source. Those statements 
have made it clear that the renegade Socialist Party traitors 
are the ones who started the fire and triggered the spark, 
believing that they would be safe from its fire. They thought 
there would be no trial or punishment, so they became blind and 
deaf. [Koranic verse] Therefore, they are now being blazed by 
the fire which they have started. The flames are devouring them 
and removing their corruption and germs from the body of the 
Yemeni homeland, the homeland of wisdom and faith. 
  The people who endured this gang's harmful abscess and 
deadly 
disease for a third-of-a-century, are determined to extract the 
abscess, remove the tumor, and to get rid of the disease. 
Toward this end, the faithful forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy are executing the will of the people. 
The good news, clear indications, and ongoing events affirm 
that victory will be for the people, unity, and constitutional 
legitimacy. The national and international stands herald a new 
upcoming dawn and tell the world that the treacherous clique 
must be encircled and that it cannot escape the people's army as 
it resolutely marches toward the dens of the gang, confidently 
digging their rotten holes and teaching them that the gang has 
no escape from the people's wrath, for it has sowed corruption 
on earth, exhausted the country, shed blood, and killed innocent 
souls. It has been doing so throughout its black history and 
bloody rule of which the Yemeni people have been afflicted. The 
tyranny of this parasitic gang, which has nothing to do with the 
Yemeni people's tenets and values, has gone far beyond any 
limits. Therefore, it was inevitable that it be confronted by 
the people, rejected by the homeland, and that it receive its 
retribution from God through His lovers and supporters in the 
army of unity, constitutional legitimacy, and the forces of 
unity and democracy. This is best proved by the fact that many 
of the elements who have been deceived for a long time have 
become aware of the lies of the gangs of apostasy and secession 
and realized the falsehood of their slogans and claims. Those 
national elements have joined the trench of unity and legitimacy 
and voluntarily surrendered to and joined the forces of the 
constitutional legitimacy. They declared their rejection of 
the gangs of apostasy and stressed their rejection of all its 
criminal actions. This mass capitulation and joining of our 
forces is taking place at all positions, axes, and governorates. 
This proves that the gangs of apostasy and secession have lost 
everything. They are exposed and have lost all the rejected, 
deceptive merchandise which they have been promoting among the 
masses throughout the past third of a century. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Central Security units in Aden City (?mounted) a 
(?surprise) rocket and artillery attack that was aimed at Aden 
international airport. That coincided with another treacherous 
attack launched by brigades of the Republican Guard and the 
Central Security against the Martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade, as well 
as an attack launched by units of the 2d Armored Brigade, 
stationed in (al-Kibsi) Camp, in Lahij Governorate against the 
command of the southern operational axis and the Bakil Air Base. 
  In the early hours of this morning, the situation was 
finally 
settled by the Central Security units and the military police in 
Aden Governorate, and the situation was completely controlled 
after large numbers of those forces joined, despite the fact 
that (?executive) al-Ahmar family in Sanaa tried to use them to 
strike at the homeland, unity, and democracy. Forces also 
joined the ranks of our valiant armed forces, while others 
surrendered. Sporadic battles are still going on with some 
pockets of the 2d Armored Brigade after some troops surrendered 
and others joined the ranks of the units of the southern 
operational axis. 
  In Dhamar, units of the Martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade managed, 
after waging fierce battles and rare heroisms and deluged by 
various combat acts, to resolutely confront and completely foil 
all the intensive attacks and campaigns carried out by the 
forces of apostasy, treason, and conspiracy. They retreated 
under the effect of the [word indistinct] precise strikes to 
rear positions. Some turned back, defeated. [passage indistinct] 
  In al-Dali' axis, a battalion from the Martyr 'Abbud 
Brigade, 
supported by crowds of valiant citizens from the sons of the 
areas, managed to stop an attack from several directions in 
which various types of heavy weapons, armored vehicles and 
artillery were used in an attempt to penetrate inside the former 
border areas. Our valiant forces, through the steadfastness of 
the masses, managed to destroy 15 tanks and other losses are not 
yet known. The battles are still most intensive in this area 
which is at present under intensive artillery shelling of 
villages and populated quarters. In the Mukayris axis, units of 
the 20th brigade are still continuing their confrontation 
valiantly against the attacking forces that tried to direct 
their strikes with various heavy weapons at Mukayris town and 
the neighboring villages. Heavy losses and damage were 
inflicted on innocent citizens and their property. 
  In another dangerous development of the military situation, 
the bloody gang of al-Ahmar family, with the aim of striking at 
important vital economic (?institutions) of the economic and 
commercial capital Aden, embarked on launching numerous air 
raids at Aden international airport and the power station, Aden 
port, the radio and tv corporation building, and the Aden 
refinery. However, our air defense, which is always vigilant, 
was lying in wait for them and shot down three hostile war 
planes. Those raids did not succeed in achieving their expected 
aims, with the exception of the travelers' lounge at Aden 
international airport where a number of civilians were killed 
and wounded as a result of this hit.

<F P=106> [Interview with MBC correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit in Sanaa by </F>
announcer Nicole Tannuri--live] 
  [Text] [Jazulit] First of all, I would like to say that the 
MBC information team is at this very moment in the Sanaa 
television building, which is now the target of southern 
warplanes. This means that the military situation has taken a 
grave turn, and that the Sanaa television building is being 
strafed by the southern warplanes. Fighting is still raging, 
and we can see this very clearly. 
  As for the situation in Sanaa, I would say that guarded calm 
prevails in the capital, but the Yemeni citizens in the capital 
are afraid that the military situation will get worse, 
particularly considering the power outage and the shortage of 
gasoline. Official departments and businesses are closed. It 
is also observed that soldiers are patrolling all streets. 
Tanks are deployed in certain areas but not in the capital as 
some news agencies have reported. I personally did not see any 
tanks in the city center as I was leaving my hotel for the 
television building. 
  [Tannuri] Tawfiq, can you contact Aden to learn about the 
latest developments there? 
  [Jazulit] As correspondents, it is difficult to contact Aden 
in view of the fierce fighting raging in this area of Yemen. 
This also applies to any Yemeni official or citizen in Sanaa or 
in the northern provinces. 
  [Tannuri] Do you know what the latest military situation on 
the combat lines is? 
  [Jazulit] First, the southern Basahib brigade was completely 
destroyed following ferocious fighting that lasted until this 
morning. 
  Second, some centers of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] in 
Sanaa were destroyed by troops. 
  Third, huge military units are advancing toward south Yemen 
to consolidate the al-'Amaliqah positions in the Abyan area. 
  Fourth, the military fighting is revolving around Aden, 
which 
has been isolated from the outside world. Sanaa has dispatched 
additional troops to reinforce their positions in order to 
settle the battle in its favor. 
  Fifth, the two sides are now using their air power, and 
military observers believe that YSP forces could enjoy 
superiority in this field. 
  Sixth, the fierce fighting has spread to the various Yemeni 
provinces and military zones, except for Sanaa, where the sound 
of artillery is continuously heard. 
  Seventh, we still do not know if the tribes are taking part 
in the fighting. As you can hear now [sound of explosion in the 
background], it seems that fighting has erupted anew in Sanaa. 
But I will continue my report. According to initial 
information, some tribes are taking part in the ongoing bloody 
struggle. Observers believe that the fighting between two 
regular armies might change to guerrilla warfare. I must stop 
now because it seems that fighting has intensified [sound of 
explosion in the background].

  [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has 
categorically denied a broadcast by the Sanaa Television channel 
saying units of martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade have surrendered and 
that the commander of the brigade has been arrested. These are 
false rumors. The responsible source described this report as 
not only completely devoid of truth, but as coming within the 
framework of the psychological war launched by the media circus 
of the bloody gang of al-Ahmar family against the sons of our 
people and their valiant armed forces. The source confirmed 
that units of the martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade are still waging 
heroic battles with all their valour and daring. They are 
confronting with sheer bravery the multitudes of the forces of 
conspiracy, treachery, and treason. 
  The source concluded his statement, saying: If there is talk 
about surrender or flight, then this is occurring on the side of 
the forces that lie under the control of the Sanaa adventurist, 
secessionist clique, and in the interest [as heard] of the 
forces of unity, democracy, and (?refinement).

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Vice President 'Ali Salim al- Bid, </F>
in Aden, by Ahmad Manjunah, in London "a short while ago"-- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Bid] My dear, the situation in Yemen, including 
Aden, is sad. Aden, Sanaa, and all of Yemen have been dragged 
onto a path different from that chosen by the Yemeni people on 
20 February. We hope that we will find our way back to the 
right path. 
  [Manjunah] Brother 'Ali, does this mean that you believe 
that 
you have arrived at a point of no return, or is there still room 
for a political solution? 
  [Al-Bid] By God, my brother, Yemen has chosen its path and 
will adhere to it. All the Yemenis will stand by the Pledge and 
Accord document, by dialogue, and by peaceful solutions. We 
will stand up against the gangs, the warmongers, and those who 
lead the Yemenis on a ruinous path. May God grant us success. 
  [Manjunah] The state of emergency declared recently by Sanaa 
-- does it apply also to southern areas, or is it confined to 
northern areas? 
  [Al-Bid] We have not learned anything about this in the 
southern provinces. The state of emergency was declared by 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih on 27 April. Currently, he is following a path 
of partition. He is doing what he pleases and forgets or 
ignores the interests of Yemen and the Yemenis. 
  [Manjunah] How true is the news that Aden's airport and 
other 
strategic areas have been seized by northern troops? 
  [Al-Bid] [Words indistinct] Everything that happened today 
is 
sad for all Yemenis, all Arabs, and all people. We have been 
forced, like someone who is wrecking his own house, 
unfortunately... 
  [Manjunah; interrupting] Now that the military situation has 
reached this stage, how do you see the situation in Yemen in 
general? 
  [Al-Bid] We should listen to reason, resort to dialogue, 
abide by the interests of the Yemeni people and homeland, honor 
the Pledge and Accord document, whose legitimacy is derived from 
national consensus, and rid ourselves of diseases, arrogance, 
and the military mentality. I say to the al-Ahmar clan: Yemen 
is bigger than any clan and any individual. Yemen will remain 
long after we are all gone. 
  [Manjunah] Brother al-Bid, thank you very much. 
  [Al-Bid] Thanks.

  [Text] A military source has issued a statement in which it 
said a number of unionist officers and soldiers in units under 
the command of the rebel secessionist elements in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] are continuing to join the ranks of the 
army of unity and constitutional legitimacy. Yesterday, all the 
personnel of the 1st Artillery Brigade in the Yarim region and 
the Khurafi camp that includes the personnel of the special 
guards of al-Bid and the personnel of the military police 
battalion joined their brothers in the units of the Armed 
Forces, which are protecting unity and democracy, after they 
discovered the hellish plan of the secessionist clique that 
wants to disrupt the homeland. 
  The military source pointed out in its statement that our 
Air 
Force defenses confronted all the treacherous, hostile air raids 
on the capital, Sanaa, and the cities of Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, 
and Ma'rib--raids that targeted vital and strategic 
installations in these cities in order to terrorize peaceful 
citizens. 
  The source also clarified that Colonel Jawad Muthanna, 
commander of the Ba Suhayb Brigade, and the brigade's staff were 
arrested yesterday after they sparked sedition in the city of 
Sanaa.

  [Text] A military source at the Defense Ministry and the 
General Staff Command has made the following statement: 
  Following our previous statement on the developments of the 
military situation that was brought about by the secessionist 
and criminal gang in the Socialist Party leadership, we present 
to the masses of our great Yemeni people the following new facts: 
  Your Armed Forces and security units, which belong to all 
the 
Yemeni people and who embrace within their close ranks -- who 
believe in God and are confident about its faith and its shining 
future -- all the sons of the one big homeland, have remained a 
fortress for the entire homeland and the achievements of the 26 
September and 14 October revolutions. They are now protecting, 
with courage, valor, and sacrifices, the most sacred 
achievements of the Yemeni revolution, unity, democracy, and 
constitutional legitimacy. 
  Since they are the forces of the entire Yemeni people, they 
know neither malice nor treacherous bloody collective 
liquidation. Therefore, and out of their full confidence in the 
honorable fate that is worthy of the human and his rights, 
honorable unionist officers, NCO's, and soldiers in the units 
that take orders from the rebellious elements in the Socialist 
Party continue to join the army of unity and constitutional 
legitimacy, confident that they will only be received with love, 
loyalty, and good treatment. The most recent example of this 
was the wise Yemeni treatment of the members of the 3d Armored 
Brigade. Today, all members of the 1st Artillery Brigade in 
(?Yalin), members of the Khurafi camp where al-Bid's personal 
security team is stationed, and members of the military police 
battalion in Sanaa joined the ranks of the army of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy. They joined the ranks of their 
brother members of the Armed Forces, the protector of unity and 
democracy, after they became aware of the nature of the wicked 
scheme of that secessionist gang that wants to fragment the 
homeland. 
  The source praised the high morale of all members of the 
Armed Forces and security units who are offering dear sacrifices 
in order to strengthen steadfastness and victory in the homeland 
of 22 May 1990. 
  In a related development, our air defense units continued 
their valiant and competent confrontation of the aircraft of 
that gang and repelled all their hostile, treacherous raids 
against the capital Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, and Ma'rib. 
These raids targeted vital and strategic installations in these 
valiant cities and aimed at terrorizing citizens. The air 
defense units foiled these missions and the aggressors retreated 
in failure. 
  At a late hour yesterday, Colonel Jawad Muthanna, the 
commander of the Ba Suhayb Brigade, and members of the brigade 
staff were arrested. They had launched sedition in Dhamar and 
then fled, but they were caught by the hand of justice. 
  The source praised the masses of our great Yemeni people in 
the entire homeland for their courageous national stand and 
their siding with the Armed Forces and security units in the 
trench of defending unity and the homeland. After they were 
burned by the fire of the fabricated crisis and its pain, these 
masses realize that this is the decisive hour of decision 
between a wrong that is nearing collapse and a right that is 
proceeding with all confidence and competence toward clear 
victory, God willing.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Yemeni House of Representatives in </F>
Sanaa on 5 May--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Praise be to God the almighty. Prayers and peace 
be upon Muhammad, the true and honest one, and on his family and 
companions until the day of judgment. 
  O sons of the unified and great Yemeni people: The House of 
Representatives, while following the successive and serious 
events the country has been passing through since the crisis 
began, emphasizes it has provided repeated opportunities for 
genuine and true dialogue designed to extricate the country from 
what it is passing through, in the hope that everyone will 
return to his senses and place both unity and democracy above 
narrow-minded party considerations and calculations. 
  For this purpose, the House has made great efforts to 
prevent 
matters from going as far as they have today. The House has 
temporarily frozen some of its constitutional powers, out of its 
concern about unity, about its continuity, and about the unity 
of the House as a Constitutional establishment representing a 
united Yemen, in order to foil the goals of the adventurers who 
want nothing good for this homeland. 
  Now that matters have reached the point of involving the 
Armed Forces in the furnace of a destructive war, of bloodshed, 
killing, and the squandering of both the property and the 
capabilities of the Armed Forces -- the shield of the people -- 
as well as the sabotaging of peaceful cities, led by the 
capital of the state of unity, the capital of historic Yemen, 
the House of Representatives is now duty-bound to carry out its 
responsibility and fully pursue its Constitutional powers -- 
powers the House was reluctant to use in the past. 
  Given all this, the House holds the secessionist clique in 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership, led by 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, who rebelled against Constitutional legitimacy and who 
created the crisis, fully responsible for what has happened and 
what is now taking place. The House has decided to remove the 
legitimacy of al-Bid and his secessionist colleagues. The House 
regards the activities they are carrying out and the decisions 
they are making as illegal and says they do not represent the 
Republic of Yemen. 
  The House regards the reckless actions the secessionist 
elements in the YSP are carrying out as a reflection of the 
ailing psyche of those who do not follow the Constitution or law 
and who do not adhere to the results of the democracy that they 
used to boast about. 
  Having studied the measures the legitimate leadership has 
taken in terms of declaring a state of emergency, the House of 
Representatives appeals to citizens to keep calm, restrain 
themselves, and cooperate with legitimate authorities to 
confront the enemies of unity and the advocates of secession 
among the YSP leaders and elements. 
  The House appeals to all sons of the Armed Forces to rally 
around the legitimate leadership, implement its instructions, 
and stand in the trench of the forces defending unity and 
democracy. This is because they are duty-bound to protect funds 
and property and to safeguard the honor of people and the blood 
of the innocent. 
  Moreover, the House appeals to the forces of good in the 
YSP, 
who reject both war and secession, to stand with legitimacy, 
unity, and democracy. God is the one who grants guidance and 
success. 
  The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that the House 
will hold a session tomorrow morning [7 May].

<F P=106> [Statement by military "source"] </F>
  [Text] A military source at the Defense Ministry and the 
General Staff Command has stressed that since they were 
established -- and with the growth in their structure, 
resources, and abilities -- the Armed Forces and security units 
have remained a power owned by the people and following the will 
of the people and their legitimate, Constitutional, legitimate 
institutions in order to fulfill all their sacred national 
missions. They are the protector and guardian of the people, 
their security, stability, and their sovereignty, and the first 
power concerned with preserving all national, developmental, and 
democratic achievements and gains. 
  They are also the people's tool that will strike with an 
iron 
fist against anyone who may be tempted to encroach on any of 
these gains and achievements. 
  Therefore, we warn against any malicious and base foolish 
act 
and any criminal, adventurous act that may seek to commit such 
ugly crimes, even under the pretext of fabricating exposed media 
lies. We refer, in particular, to the statement broadcast 
yesterday over Aden radio, which is still under the control of 
the secessionist, rebellious gang in the Socialist Party 
leadership. The statement falsely claimed that our valiant air 
forces -- the protector of the skies of the dear Yemeni homeland 
and its blessed ground -- yesterday attacked the thermal power 
station in Aden, as well as other selected targets, such as the 
radio and television stations, and other vital and strategic 
installations that belong to the people and are a source of 
fortune and public interest and which should be protected by 
every Yemeni individual. 
  But, what can we say to those who do not differentiate 
between their rancorous lies, their crimes against the people 
and the people's achievements, and their own sick aspirations? 
Our people must know the truth about what may have happened to 
these installations at the hands of the malicious people 
themselves in their drive toward the abyss of fabricating 
excuses to commit crimes of sabotage, destruction, and damage. 
  The falsehood, lies, and deceptive claims contained in that 
statement are not worthy of any consideration or response on our 
part. This will be confirmed by facts and evidence about other 
lies and deceptive claims.

  [Text] A responsible source has stated the following: 
  Despite the patience we have demonstrated and the 
concessions 
we have made out of our concern to preserve unity and democracy 
and the country's safety and security, and despite the signing 
of the Pledge and Accord document in the Jordanian capital, 
Amman, two and one- half months ago -- a document whose signing 
was supposed to end the crisis and to signal the beginning of 
its implementation -- the secessionist gang in the leadership of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], led by war criminal al-Bid and 
his secessionist gang, which is rebelling against Constitutional 
legitimacy, has insisted on continuing the crisis it created, 
refusing to even appear before the House of Representatives to 
take the Constitutional oath. This gang has prevented the 
convening of official institutions within Constitutional 
legitimacy and went so far as to start a series of painful and 
bloody clashes between the comrades-in-arms of the Yemeni 
people. This began with the attack on the al-'Amaliqah forces 
in Abyan, besieging the citizens in Mudiyah, creating sedition 
in the (Harth Sifiyan), and intentional provocations in Shabwah 
and Dhamar, and finally starting the horrible and disastrous 
fighting between the Third and First Armored Brigades at the 
'Imran military camp. 
  The secessionist gang in the YSP leadership was not 
satisfied 
with creating these disasters and tragedies, perhaps because 
this gang has not yet lost hope of carrying out its suspect and 
evil plot. This gang has brought the military situation to this 
degree of seriousness in total disregard of the possible threats 
to the country. Its blind hatred has covered everything in the 
country, including the land and the people, and the state and 
its achievements. The gang started an all-out war on the evening 
of the sad and gory Wednesday in all parts of Yemen. This began 
at 2005 with an attack against the Presidential Guard battalion 
in Dhamar and the siege and attack with all kinds of weapons 
against the Central security detachment in Aden. The same 
night, they carried out a comprehensive attack against the units 
of the 2d Armored Brigade in the al-Rahah area in the Lahij 
Governorate, and sent the Air Force to strike vital and 
strategic targets in Sanaa, al-Hudaydah, and Ta'izz. 
  Thus, the YSP tyrants, led by the traitor al-Bid and his 
secessionist, criminal gang, have indulged their hatred to its 
utmost by attacking the people, the homeland, unity, and 
democracy, prompted by the grotesque megalomania of their 
secretary general, al-Bid. This is a flagrant rebellion against 
Constitutional legitimacy and high treason to the homeland and 
humanity. Thus, the people will never forgive them. They will 
bear the curse of God and history. They will face the severest 
punishment. Their final fate will be the darkness of their 
graves. 
  As for the heroes of the Armed and Security Forces, the 
protectors of unity and democracy, they will be held high by the 
support of our struggling people in the epic of pride and glory. 
With their chaste blood and sacred sacrifices, they are writing 
bright pages of decisive victory for the homeland, the people, 
unity, democracy, justice, and prosperity, God willing. 
  If you will help the cause of Allah, he will help you and 
plant your feet firmly. [Koranic verse]

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "'Ali Nasir Tells AL-HAYAH: Two </F>
'Ali's Should Go If They Fail To Solve Problems"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Former Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir 
Muhammad has urged President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid to "leave" power "if they fail to 
solve the problems." He pointed out that the solution to the 
problem lies in the implementation of the Pledge and Accord 
Document signed in Amman, which "stipulated the establishment of 
a federation between the two parts of Yemen." He also warned of 
the possible partition of Yemen into "regions, not just two 
parts." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH 'Ali Nasir said that yesterday he 
phoned a number of Arab leaders and Yemenis "to contain the 
crisis and halt the political and military collapse taking 
place, and to return to the negotiating table and dialogue, 
because the alternative to dialogue is collapse and ruin." He 
denied he had made direct contacts with foreign leaders. "The 
contacts were made via Arab channels." However, he did not name 
the Arab or foreign leaders with whom he made contacts. 
  He said: "I cannot say that the fighting will lead to the 
collapse of unity. It is a wound in the body of national and 
Yemeni unity. It will take a long time for this wound to heal." 
He added: "If current developments turn into civil war, Yemen 
could turn into more than one state or an entity divided into 
regions." He stressed that he personally is "against infighting 
and separation. There is no future for Yemen except under 
unity. The leadership is the problem. Everyone is blaming unity 
for the problems, when unity has nothing to do with them. They 
talk in the name of the (Pledge and Accord) Document, unity, and 
the revolution, but their practices have nothing to do with 
these things or with democracy. Their actions are based on 
their narrow personal interests." 
  Concerning a way out of the current crisis, the former South 
Yemen president said: "I stress the need to conduct a dialogue 
and merge institutions. If they (Yemeni leaders) fail to solve 
the problem and extricate Yemen from the current crisis, it is 
better for them to depart and safeguard their history and the 
achievement they have made." 
  He noted that he contacted President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
the 
day before yesterday evening, but he could not speak to 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid because telephone lines to Aden are cut off. He 
also contacted Yasin Nu'man, chairman of the Socialist Party 
secretariat, and Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad, Abyan governor and member 
of the Socialist Party Political Bureau, two days ago. 
  'Ali Nasir commended the U.S. position on the current 
crisis, 
saying the Americans "are for safeguarding unity and democracy. 
They urge modernizing the building of the state and stability in 
Yemen and the region, and I support this. If unity is in their 
interests, it is in our interests too." 
  He stressed the need to implement the Pledge and Accord 
Document. He said that "many of its stipulations still have not 
been implemented, even though it enjoyed a national, Arab, 
popular, and international consensus." On his opinion of the 
federation question as a solution and a way out of the current 
crisis, he said that the document stipulates "the establishment 
of a federation. But regrettably, it has not been implemented. 
Nor has the Constitution been applied or the document 
implemented. Its essence should be implemented. What I am 
interested in is to safeguard unity; the other things are 
details." 
  On the possibility of his return to Yemen he said that, "if 
this question is raised, I am willing to play any role to 
contribute to finding a way out of the crisis, but not for the 
sake of power or a post." He avoided "holding anyone 
responsible. Everyone is responsible. The issue is not who 
started it all, but, rather, the devastating effects we are 
experiencing."

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Ministry of Interior in Sanaa; date not </F>
given] 
  [Text] A security source at the Ministry of Interior has 
explained that the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 20 for 
1994 on declaring a state of emergency in the country have 
nothing to do with banning the manifestations of normal daily 
life in the capital and other cities in the Republic. Various 
daily activities as well as commercial and production activities 
are taking place normally. 
  The source said a state of emergency was declared in the 
country in view of the need to entrench security and stability 
and to safeguard citizens' security and safety in this crucial 
phase the country is passing through. Thus, the Ministry of 
Interior appeals to the brother citizens to observe the 
following: 
  1. Not to carry weapons throughout the Republic's 
governorates, even if their carriage is licensed, and also not 
to open fire regardless of justification. 
  2. Not to hold any meetings, gatherings, crowds, 
demonstrations, or similar things. 
  3. Not to carry out any acts aimed at looting or 
encroaching on public and private properties. 
  4. To refrain from moving inside the capitals of the 
governorates from 2100 to 0500. 
  The ministry hopes all brother citizens will abide by what 
is 
mentioned above and cooperate with the security organizations to 
achieve the public interest and entrench the homeland's security 
and stability in general.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--The scheduled Arab League 
mission to Yemen to try to end the political crisis and prevent 
a destructive civil war has been postponed. 
  A responsible source at the Arab League said that Arab 
League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid asked Major General 
Sa'id Bayraqdar, assistant secretary general for military 
affairs, and Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Sakit, the Arab League's

  [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has issued an urgent appeal to the 
brothers in Yemen, calling on them to refrain from fighting, 
exercise self-restraint, and close their ranks. Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid warned the Yemenis that partition and civil war 
would only bring ruin and hardship. 
  The secretary general said that Arab countries and the 
league's General Secretariat are following the escalation of the 
situation in Yemen with concern and that they hope to see it end 
soon. 
  Yesterday Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid telephoned President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and offered to send a high-level delegation to 
Yemen to help contain the crisis. However, the delegation could 
not travel to Yemen because of the shelling of Sanaa Airport. 
  Today Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid received a telephone call from 
Yemeni 
Prime Minister Dr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. The secretary 
general urged al-'Attas to seek an end to the fighting to 
preserve the safety, security, and stability of brotherly Yemen.

  [Text] Cairo--The Arab League has received official 
memoranda from the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council related to their view of the way to deal with the 
subject of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East 
region. AL-HAYAH has been informed about the Saudi, Qatari, and 
Omani memoranda. 
  The Saudi memorandum emphasized the [necessity of] 
subjecting 
the Israeli nuclear facilities to international inspection, 
while Qatar demanded a "quantitative and qualitative equality in 
the military capabilities of the region's states," and the Omani 
memorandum called for eliminating weapons of mass destruction 
within a framework of achieving peace. It also proposed 
confidence-building measures and decreased military spending. 
The Saudi memorandum included the following: 
  1. The Kingdom supports making the Middle East region free 
of 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  2. It is important and necessary for Israel to join the 
nuclear weapons proliferation ban agreement, for it to subject 
all of its nuclear facilities to international inspection, and 
for the intensification of efforts and prompting by the 
international community to induce Israel to join the agreement. 
  3. Signing of a chemical weapons ban agreement is not 
incompatible with efforts to induce Israel to sign the nuclear 
weapons proliferation ban. In fact, it is in the interest of 
such an effort. 
  4. It is important to bring up in the multilateral talks the 
subject of Israel's signing of the nuclear weapons proliferation 
ban and to make the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass 
destruction, within the context of the arms limitation committee. 
  Three points were brought up in the memorandum submitted by 
Qatar, which hosted the arms limitation committee: 
  1. It is necessary that arms limitation arrangements mirror 
the determination of the states concerned with living in peace, 
in the light of the new circumstances and relationships 
prevailing in the Middle East in order to achieve stability and 
security, while taking into consideration the difficulty of 
achieving any substantial decrease in armaments levels in the 
region in the absence of peace and stability. 
  2. The degree of progress in the bilateral negotiations 
between Israel and the Arab sides must influence the degree of 
progress in the field of arms limitation. The achievement of 
progress in the field of arms limitation and security 
arrangements may have a positive effect on the bilateral 
negotiations as well, and the achievement of peace is the only 
guarantee of security for all the parties. 
  3. Basic considerations and principles that should be the 
basis for the arms limitation regime are: 
  A. It is necessary to provide a quantitative and 
qualitative equality in the military capabilities of the 
region's states, because the current inequality cannot continue. 
  B. It is necessary to achieve security through discussion 
and political arrangements, and eliminating policies of military 
superiority. 
  C. These principles should be applied to all the states of 
the area without exception or preference in an equal, balanced 
form at similar levels, applied according to a single 
measurement. 
  D. It is necessary to continue the dialogue about arms 
limitation questions by gradual stages leading to putting in 
place a mechanism and regional measures for arms limitation. 
  [Qatar] proposed realizing the nature of the problems and 
determining them according priorities, agreeing on confidence 
building measures before the sides announce their intention to 
take steps in fields which are agreed must have priority. It is 
necessary that all the concerned sides in the region agree to be 
bound legally by contractual obligations before joining into the 
nuclear weapons proliferation ban agreement, and that they 
concur in the application of international means of verifying 
their adherance to the agreement. 
  The Omani memorandum included seven points: 
  1. Dealing with the problem of weapons of mass destruction 
in 
the region. They should be eliminated within the context of 
achieving peace, and the area is still in a situation of doubt 
and distrust over the renunciation of its destructive weapons 
stores. The tremendous assets that are being spent on these 
weapons should be used in development programs. 
  2. The dialogue about armaments should continue in gradual 
stages, each of which leads to the next, with a time schedule or 
program to achieve effective steps toward peace which is 
parallel to steps toward eliminating these armaments. 
  3. The memorandum refers to the Sultanate's signing of a 
chemical weapons ban and requests that all the countries of the 
region sign it. 
  4. It is up to Israel and the Arabs to announce their 
intention to eliminate destructive weapons stores and to accept 
international inspection of the manufacture and development of 
these arms at the appropriate time. 
  5. Conventional weapons in the region should be drawn down, 
with a view to the long-range national security of each side in 
the area. The goal is to increase this security so that no side 
achieves a greater security, military, or strategic advantage at 
the expense of another. 
  6. The Sultanate of Oman believes that the principal threat 
comes from unlimited proliferation of these weapons, and that it 
is up to every country in the world to work toward a world free 
of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, safeguarding 
world peace and security. 
  7. It is necessary to take measures to build confidence, and 
the Sultanate proposes: 
  A. Issuing a statement about the danger of not controlling 
the arms race. 
  B. It is necessary to limit expenses in defense-related 
fields. 
  C. It is necessary to prevent the accumulation of weapons 
of mass destruction. 
  D. Settlement of disputes by peaceful means. 
  E. Nonaggression and nonintervention in internal affairs.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and 
West Bank have responded cautiously to the signing of the 
agreement on Palestinian self rule. [passage omitted]. Faysal 
al-Husayni, the senior Palestinian leader in the West Bank and 
Yasir 'Arafat's lieutenant there, said Jericho and other issues 
such as Jewish settlements would create problems for the 
agreement. He told Middle East correspondent Tony Hill that the 
signing of the agreement in Cairo would now bring changes, but 
it was still of concern to many Palestinians. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Husayni] Fortunately there will be a 
change, but we are worried because we know that there are some 
articles in this agreement which can create a real tendency to 
(?so complicate it) and the Israelis are insisting that to keep 
some articles there which we know very well that it will be 
obstacle for any solution in the future. 
  [Hill] You said the day before that you believe Mr 'Arafat 
should not sign this agreement under these present 
circumstances. Should he have signed it in Cairo? 
  [Al-Husayni] I don't know what he writes on the map before 
he 
signed it but he put a long statement which means that he was 
signing on it under very bad circumstances that he found himself 
forced to write something before signing on it. 
  [Hill] Isn't this a matter of public confidence in this 
agreement and won't that problem in Cairo over the signing only 
undermine that public confidence in this agreement? 
  [Al-Husayni] A lot of problems will created, a lot of price 
will be paid until the Israelis will convince that what they are 
asking us now is unpractical and unrational [as heard]. 
  [Hill] So you believe this agreement as it stands now may 
not 
succeed? 
  [Al-Husayni] I believe that this agreement as it is now and 
if the Israelis will try to implement it literally, it will cost 
a lot of us a high price, but in the end the Israelis will 
discover that this is not the way. 
  [Hill] What can Yasir 'Arafat and Palestinian leaders like 
you do then to make sure this agreement does succeed as it is 
signed? 
  [Al-Husayni] First I was hoping that it will not be signed 
today [4 May] before making these changes. As far as it was 
signed today, so we will do everything to improve it in the 
right way, and to show the Israelis from the beginning where is 
the points which is not right points to be there and to convince 
them to take it out [as heard]. 
  [Hill] There has only been a very quiet response from 
Palestinians in the occupied territories. Do you now feel an 
urgency to try to get some real changes quickly on the ground to 
improve confidence? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes, the only thing that can bring back this 
confidence is the implementations on the ground and that's what 
we are insisting on now. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Palestinian Chief of Security and </F>
Police Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Our Forces Will Enter Gaza and 
Jericho Not Later Than 20 May"] 
  [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Palestinian chief of 
security and police has confirmed that the Palestinian police 
forces will enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho by 20 May at the 
latest. He said that the entry will be completed within two 
weeks after the signing of the final agreement on the 
implementation of autonomy. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Major General Mudar 
Yusuf (Abu-Yusuf) revealed that the forces will be transported 
to al-'Arish airport in Sinai by military transport planes. 
  He denied recent rumors that Israel will hand over to the 
PLO 
five important police posts in the occupied Gaza Strip next 
Tuesday. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf said: "These reports are unfounded." He 
added that in the first stage, the Palestinian police will enter 
Gaza and Jericho at the same time but the main effort will be 
concentrated on Gaza, which is densely populated, to provide 
security and stability there. He stressed that preparations 
have been made in all areas where Palestinian police and 
security forces are present and that they are awaiting orders to 
move. 
  Abu-Yusuf said that, in the first phase, some 6,000 
policemen 
will arrive in Gaza-Jericho, 4,500 of them going to Gaza and 
1,500 going to Jericho, and these forces will enter as units in 
their present formations. Some of these formations may later be 
changed depending on circumstances on the ground and need. He 
added that the PLO recently received special military uniforms 
for the Palestinian police from Norway, and the first 
consignment of U.S. aid, consisting of police vehicles, has 
already arrived. 
  In reply to a question about the structure of the police 
forces and whether they mainly consist of Fatah elements, Maj. 
Gen. Yusuf emphasized that the forces which will be responsible 
for security and stability in the Gaza Strip and Jericho "are 
not factional forces. They are national forces belonging to all 
the Palestinian people." He confirmed that "the Palestine 
Liberation Army [PLA], which includes elements from all the 
factions as well as elements not affiliated with any factions, 
has now become a security and police force." 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf revealed that "a large number [of people] 
from the factions opposed to the Oslo agreement have sent us 
applications to join these forces." He added that in the coming 
phase, the Palestinian police forces will not operate on a 
factional basis but on the basis of the Palestinian authority 
which will consist of various sectors of the Palestinian people 
regardless of their political affiliations. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf ruled out the possibility of any major 
problems when the Palestinian police forces arrive. He also 
ruled out the possibility of friction between them and Hamas 
"because the brothers in Hamas have repeatedly stated their 
opposition to Palestinian infighting, and we will make every 
effort to promote understanding and agreement with them." 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf urged all sectors and factions of the 
Palestinian people "to extend a helping hand to the Palestinian 
police and security forces for the sake of building our future 
authority, easing our people's suffering, and providing security 
and stability for them." 
  On the spread of arms possession in the city of Gaza and 
whether that will be a security problem for the Palestinian 
police forces, he said: "Arms do not scare us."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ghassan al-Khatib, member of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks and 
professor at Bi'r Zayt University, in Jerusalem, by Fayiz 
al-Miliji in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From 
Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Miliji] Good morning Mr. Ghassan al-Khatib. 
We welcome you to our talk show. 
  [Al-Khatib] Good morning and thank you. 
  [Al-Miliji] To start with, could you fill us in on the 
reactions to the signing of the agreement on starting to 
implement autonomy in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Al-Khatib] The reaction is the opposite of what was 
expected. The Palestinian people in the occupied territories 
received the signing of this agreement and the celebrations that 
went with it lukewarmly and cautiously, quite opposite to their 
reception of the Oslo agreement and the celebrations following 
its signing in Washington. The reason is that the repeated 
Israeli stalling in implementing the agreements has created 
indifference among the Palestinian people. Because of the 
Israeli stalling the Palestinians have lost faith that such 
agreements will actually be implemented. The Palestinian man in 
the street is saying that he will believe these things only 
after they are implemented, because he has seen many things 
signed and heard about many agreements. None of these ever 
changed the course of his practical life. Therefore, the 
reaction to, or judgement of this agreement by the Palestinians 
here has been put on hold until after the Palestinian people see 
the actual implementation or effects of this agreement on their 
lives. Then, the whole situation will be different. 
  [Al-Miliji] The agreement that was signed the day before 
yesterday still has some pending matters that have not been 
agreed upon. Do you think the Palestinian people are worried 
about these points? 
  [Al-Khatib] Frankly speaking, the Palestinian people are 
worried about a lot of things. First, they are worried because 
there are some matters that have been put off. Our people have 
gone through some difficult times and were promised certain 
changes that never happened. 
  [Al-Miliji] Although you have always shown concern for the 
Palestinian people, do you not see any reasons for optimism now, 
especially since the Palestinian and Israeli sides have adopted 
the slogan "Let there be peace"? 
  [Al-Khatib] Yes. There are certain things that should make 
the Palestinians optimistic. But this optimism is hedged with 
caution and apprehension. For example, the possibility of 
allowing the Palestinian leadership, police, and the army--that 
is the Palestinian Liberation Army--to enter the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho are great sources of hope and optimism for the 
Palestinian masses. In addition, the possibility of releasing 
or the majority of the Palestinian detainees, if not all of 
them, is also a source of hope and optimism for the Palestinian 
people. However, so far the Palestinian people have not seen 
any practical results despite the large number of agreements and 
hopes, so they have mixed feelings of optimism, expectation, and 
anticipation to see what the practical changes will be. After 
that, the government can be established. 
  [Al-Miliji] Mr. Ghassan al-Khatib, today is the third day 
since the agreement was signed. In other words, the it has not 
been very long. Now, everyone is waiting for the Israeli forces 
to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho and the Palestinian police to 
enter. Does this not provide grounds for optimism rather than 
concern and tension? 
  [Al-Khatib] Yes, but you have to remember that there have 
been agreements in the past and Israel stalled on implementing 
them. It also stalled on the negotiations over implementation. 
It created obstacles everywhere, thus hindering the practical 
implementation of these agreements. Various dates were agreed 
upon that were not respected by Israel, who always claimed that 
deadlines were not sacred. Thus, our people are afraid to be 
overly optimistic in order to avoid disappointment like after 
the Madrid conference and the signing of the Oslo agreement, 
etc. However, there is anticipation and hope. After the 
Palestinian leadership and police enter the territory, after 
some changes start taking place, and as soon as the Israeli 
withdrawal starts, I expect the mood of the Palestinian people 
to shift. 
  [Al-Miliji] Mr. al-Khatib, have the Israeli forces started 
withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Al-Khatib] The Israeli forces have vacated a few locations 
in Gaza City, or the Gaza Strip. This has left a positive 
impression with the Palestinian people. The people understand 
clearly that things take time and that complications may crop 
up. Therefore, they are waiting to see how the agreement will 
be implemented. They will take their stands based to that. 
  [Al-Miliji] In your capacity as a leading figure of the 
Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, could you tell us 
when the Palestinian police will enter? 
  [Al-Khatib] A group of 17 high-ranking Palestinian officers 
have already entered the Gaza Strip at Rafah crossing. They 
have begun a series of meetings with ranking Israeli army and 
police officers to put the final touches on the process of 
handing over the buildings and security responsibilities to the 
Palestinian police. After these meetings, this group will submit 
recommendations on the necessary time period for handing over 
responsibilities. Based on their recommendations, the date for 
the Palestinian police's entry will be set. 
  [Al-Miliji] Our last question is: How are the Palestinian 
people preparing themselves to receive Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat when he enters the occupied territories for the 
first time since Palestinian autonomy began? 
  [Al-Khatib] Actually, President 'Arafat is greatly respected 
and supported in the occupied territories. I notice that the 
Palestinian people are anxiously awaiting the return of the 
Palestinian leadership headed by brother Yasir 'Arafat, 
especially since the Palestinian people are expecting his return 
to spread a sense of security and stability after the difficult 
conditions we have gone through. Of course, when brother 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] returns he will be accompanied by a 
large number of Palestinian people, be they leaders or 
otherwise, who are living abroad. The people here are awaiting 
this very anxiously. 
  Therefore, I believe that the return of the Palestinian 
leadership will soon have a positive effect on the mood of the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories. 
  [Al-Miliji] At the end of this dialogue, we thank our guest 
Mr. Ghassan al-Khatib, member of the Palestinian delegation to 
the peace talks and professor at Bi'r Zayt University, who spoke 
to us from Jerusalem. Thank you Mr. Ghassan. 
  [Al-Khatib] Thank you.

<F P=106> [By Muhammad Abu-Khudayr] </F>
  [Excerpts] Jerusalem -- Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former 
head of the Palestinian delegation, has said that the Cairo 
agreement does not call for optimism because what Israel is 
doing and implementing on the ground contradicts the concept of 
peace. 
  'Abd-al-Shafi asked: Does 'Arafat's hesitation in signing 
the maps prove that there is a contradiction between what is 
written and what is drawn? 
  'Abd-al-Shafi added that the agreement places many obstacles 
to reaching a just peace and gives Israel more reasons to cling 
to its inflexible stance and its claim that it has a right to 
the occupied territories. He noted that Israel has expressed 
its positions by setting up more settlements and annexing 
Jerusalem, in addition to the numerous measures that it has 
practiced against our people. 
  'Abd-al-Shafi said: At any rate, now we are facing a fait 
accompli, which will confront us with new threats. [passage 
omitted] 
  Shaykh Jamil al-Hamami, one of the most prominent Islamic 
figures in the occupied territories, said: I am pained and 
saddened over what happened in Cairo. Is this how one manages 
the future of a people and nation and the struggle of 
generations of people? If this is proof of anything, it is lack 
of seriousness in discussing the Palestinian people's fate and 
the Palestinian cause. 
  Al-Hamami said: This agreement represents a great obstacle 
to achieving a just and comprehensive peace and to realizing the 
Palestinian people's aspirations. We in the occupied 
territories feel very sad in light of Israeli arrogance, the 
settlers' practices, and the U.S. Administration's support for 
Israel. 
  Al-Hamami added: This is a temporary and not a permanent 
agreement because it does not respond to the aspirations and 
hopes of our Muslim Palestinian people, who have been patient 
and have suffered and endured. I do not think this is the end 
as the agreement is stillborn. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi said that the Palestinian people deal 
with 
reality and not with conferences, papers, and political 
positions. They are endeavoring to remove and end the 
occupation. She added that while the agreement was being signed 
in Cairo by the PLO chairman, Israel continued to impose a 
blockade on Jerusalem and settlers were engaged in provocative 
acts. 
  Dr. 'Ashrawi said: We are not against peace, but the process 
should be based on fundamental considerations and a cumulative 
momentum that lead to obtaining rights, not beautifying them and 
maintaining the occupation. 
  For his part, Faysal al-Husayni said: It was not necessary 
to abide by the date of the signing of the agreement and to 
leave important issues. It would have been better to postpone 
the signing until an agreement with clear outlines was reached. 
  In a related development, most of the Palestinian figures in 
the occupied territories who support the peace process refused 
to attend the signing ceremony to express their reservations to 
the agreement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Fayiz Abu-Rahmah, former head of Gaza </F>
Bar Association, by Philippe Rochot in Gaza -- live, in English 
with superimposed French translation ] 
  [Text] [Rochot] I have with me Dr. Fayiz Abu-Rahmah, who is 
close to Yasir 'Arafat, who has fought here for the peace 
agreements, and whom I am going to ask whether in the end he is 
not disappointed to see that these agreements are taking a long 
time to get implemented, in particular the arrival of the 
Palestinian police that was expected today. 
  [Abu-Rahmah] No, it is a practical question, and we think 
they will be here by next week. 
  [Rochot] You aren't worried because a lot of extremists want 
to attack the peace process? 
  [Abu-Rahmah] No, we aren't afraid, we aren't worried. The 
extremists have their opinions, and the others have theirs. 
That is democracy. 
  [Rochot] How do you see your relations with the Israelis 
after this agreement? 
  [Abu-Rahmah] They will be cordial relations, and we hope 
this 
peaceful coexistence will develop. 
  [Rochot] There are a lot of people without work here. There 
are no jobs. How do you see the reconstruction of the Gaza 
Strip? 
  [Abu-Rahmah] Yes, the unemployment problem is extremely 
serious. We hope the Israelis will help to employ a certain 
percentage of the population. Others will be a burden for the 
Palestinian administration. 
  [Rochot] You are also expecting help from the European 
Community, but you haven't received anything? 
  [Abu-Rahmah] Yes, we are expecting their help. We hope it 
will be generous, because the Gaza Strip is a very poor place, 
without resources. Its only resources are its people. We hope 
its men and women will be able to be productive in one way or 
another, and we hope that one day Gaza will become the Hong Kong 
of the Middle East.

<F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Natasha Bukhari] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Palestinians are suspicious of agreements on 
paper and are anticipating the actual implementation of the 
historic accord on self-rule of Gaza and Jericho, according to 
Salih Ra'fat, a member of the Palestine Central Council. 
  "Palestinians are suspicious of the new Cairo agreement, 
especially with the Israeli occupation forces' closure of the 
city of Jerusalem and the military constraints Israelis are 
exercising on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip," Mr. 
Ra'fat told the JORDAN TIMES on Wednesday [4 May]. 
  PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq 
Rabin Wednesday signed the agreement on self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho in Cairo. The agreement, which was under negotiation 
for the last six months, will clear the way for the first 
Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian areas it seized in the 
1967 war. 
  Palestinians are divided in the way they look at the peace 
talks. There are those who fully support the talks and back the 
negotiators. Then there are those who back the principle of 
peace but want a tougher stand in negotiations. And last there 
are those who oppose the principle of making peace with Israel 
altogether. 
  Ibrahim Qub'ah, also a member of th Palestine Central 
Council, told the JORDAN TIMES that he saw the signing of the 
Cairo agreement as a coup which is bound to shock and confuse 
the Palestinians no matter how prepared they though they wee. 
"While Nayif Hawatimah says that Wednesday was a black day in 
the history of the Palestinian people, I consider it to be a 
milestone that marks the beginning of the ushering in of an 
independent Palestinian entity," said Mr. Qub'ah. 
  Nayif Hawatimah, the leader of the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and George Habash, the leader of 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) lead a 
10-faction coalition that includes the Islamic Resistance 
Movement, Hamas. The coalition operates from Damascus, and has 
followers in the occupied territories. 
  Mr. Qub'ah urged Mr. Hawatimah to show courage and stop 
talkinig about nothing but the "humiliating submission of the 
PLO." 
  Mr. Ra'fat, a member of the DFLP faction that supports the 
peace talks accused Palestinian negotiators of submitting to 
humiliating conditions in the Cairo agreement which, he said, 
contradicts the clauses of the Oslo agreement. He said that 
while the Oslo agreement gave Israelis the right to secure order 
only within Israeli settlements, the Cairo agreement sitpulates 
that Israeli forces will continue to operate in Jericho and the 
Gaza Strip. 
  Ibrahim Abu 'Ayyash, also a member of the Palestine Central 
Council, urged all Palestinians to join forces to make 
successful the implementation of the Cairo agreement, which, he 
said, fell short of addressing major issues. Mr. Abu 'Ayyash 
added that one cannot but fear the consequences of the autonomy 
accord as it failed to attain major achievements. 
  "While we are signing peace agreements, Israelis are 
establishing more settlements in different areas of the occupied 
territories, and that is very worrying," Mr. Abu 'Ayyash said. 
  Mr. Ra'fat, however, said that he hoped for the 
establishment of a "real" Palestinian authority in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip in order to reclaim Jerusalem and end all forms 
of Israeli occupation. 
  Mr. Qub'ah criticized the Palestinian negotiators for what 
he called their failure to coordinate with the Jordanian 
government where the peace talks are concerned. 
  "Palestinians and Jordanians are one body, and this lack of 
coordination will reflect negatively on the future Palestinian 
entity if the situation is not corrected," Mr. Qub'ah said.

  [Text] London: Quds Press--The Islamic Resistance 
Movement, Hamas, has stated that it does not recognize any 
agreements the PLO concludes with Israel. The movement, opposed 
to the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles agreement, 
says it will continue to work to scuttle the accord. The 
statements were made by Hamas' spokesman Muhammad Nazal in a 
telephone interview. He told Quds Press "this and previous 
agreements are not binding on the Palestinian people, and 
represent only their signers." These agreements, in our eyes, 
renounce our people's and nation's rights to the land and 
sanctitities, as he put it. 
  Nazzal stressed that his movement will resist this agreement 
with the same intensity it did before it was signed. Hamas will 
enhance coordination with other opposition Palestinian forces to 
cope with the challenges associated with the agreement. His 
movement, he said, will revitalize the alliance opposed to the 
negotiations with Israel that was instituted months back.

  [Text] London: Quds Press--The Islamic Jihad Movement in 
Palestine has stated that it will carry on with its fight 
against Israeli occupation, despite the signing of the agreement 
launching self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  A statement sent by the movement to Quds Press says the 
signing of the agreement "shows how lightly our people's appeals 
have been taken." 
  The movement, which takes a negative view of the peace 
negotiations with Israel, said "the agreement amounts to 
capitulation and will not bring peace." "The causes that 
triggered the intifadah are still there," it emphasized. 
  The agreement 'Arafat and Rabin signed in Cairo yesterday 
skirts the substance of occupation, the Islamic Jihad said. 
This shoddy agreement, the movement's statement warned, lays 
the groundwork for other wars in the region in that it 
represents complete acquiescence in Zionist dictates and terms.

  [Excerpts] A general strike was observed in Jerusalem and 
other occupied Arab territories for the second consecutive day 
in protest against the self-rule agreement. A period of general 
mourning, called for by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], 
prevails throughout the occupied Arab territories. 
  News agencies described the atmosphere in the occupied 
territories. They said a state of apprehension and 
disappointment is prevailing in these territories. 
'Abd-al-Karim Sidr, a leading Fatah member in Jericho, 
described the situation in Jericho as inconvenient. He said 
there is Palestinian anxiety because of the large gap between 
Palestinians in the occupied territories and the Palestinian 
team that negotiates with Israel. [passage omitted] 
  Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine, and Dr. George Habash, 
secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine, held a news conference yesterday. They criticized 
the Cairo agreement, saying that it does not meet the 
Palestinian people's demands and that it completely ignores both 
the UN resolutions and international legitimacy. Hawatimah and 
Habash added that this agreement will not be binding on the 
Palestinian people. 
  Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, said the agreement 
would fail within three months. In a statement, Jibril added 
that the Alliance of Palestinian Forces will continue its 
struggle against Israeli occupation. 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, said the self-rule 
agreement bestows legitimacy on occupation, injustice, and 
repression, adding that this agreement will not last long. 
Ibrahim Ghawshah, official Hamas spokesman, stressed the 
failure of the agreement on implementing the self-rule, which 
was signed by 'Arafat and Rabin in Cairo the day before 
yesterday. This agreement will not succeed, he noted. 
  In a statement yesterday, Ghawshah added that the agreement 
does not meet any of the Palestinian people's aspirations and 
demands regarding liberation, repatriation, self-determination, 
and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Instead, the 
agreement increased the Palestinian people's fragmentation and 
revealed the impotence and fragility of the PLO leadership in 
Tunis. Ghawshah said the most serious result of this agreement 
is that it diverted attention from Israeli occupation and 
created tremendous internal contradictions, which Rabin and 
Peres sought to foster when they promptly signed the agreement. 
  Concluding his statement, Ghawshah called on the Palestinian 
people in and outside the occupied territories to close ranks 
and unify their position in order to topple this agreement.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "10 Factions Attack </F>
`Concessions'; Islamic Jihad Pledges To Step Up Attacks; Popular 
Front Will Not Confront Palestinian Police"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- The 10 Palestinian oppositionist 
factions have said that the signing yesterday of the agreement 
on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord is the 
culmination of a "series of concessions" offered by President 
Yasir 'Arafat. They pledged to step up the "struggle against 
the occupation," politically and militarily. They stressed 
their refusal to participate in the self-rule authority. 
However, they indicated their wish to avoid any "confrontation" 
with the Palestinian police. Talal Ahmad, media spokesman for 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] led by 
George Habash, said that the agreement "is the culmination of 
the concessions that led to the self-rule authority agreement. 
It gives Israel complete control at all levels." In a 
statement to AL-HAYAH he said that the PFLP will not participate 
in the self-rule authority, "but we will not allow any violent 
confrontations against the Palestinian authority or the police. 
We will continue our struggle against Israel and the occupation 
wherever they exist in order to secure a settlement that offers 
the Palestinian people a just solution." He stressed the PFLP's 
intention of moving its decisionmaking to the occupied 
territories in the light of recent developments on the 
Palestinian scene. He pointed out that the "agreement should 
take place inside and that it should be basically confronted 
inside." 
  On the possibility of PFLP cadres' entry into the Gaza 
Strip, 
he said that the return is "a right for everyone. It has 
nothing to do with the (position on the) agreement." 
  Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad 
Movement, told AL-HAYAH that the agreement "confirms that what 
is intended is the establishment of an entity subservient to the 
Zionist entity both economically and at the security level." He 
said that the agreement does not provide for a Palestinian state 
plan. He warned that he will confront the agreement by 
reactivating military and political action. 
  A spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP] led by Nayif Hawatimah said that the agreement 
"is not binding on the Palestinian people." And that yesterday 
"was not the end of Palestinian national history, but, rather, 
the beginning of a new phase of struggle whose task is to topple 
the self-rule and continue the struggle." 
  In a statement issued by him he went on: The agreement "has 
exposed all attempts at deception and cheating and all the false 
allegations about the partitioned self-rule in Gaza and Jericho." 
  The "central leadership" of the [Palestinian Forces] 
Alliance 
held a meeting yesterday evening to discuss ways of conducting 
action after the signing of the agreement. Hamas considered 
yesterday an "ill-omened" day in the Palestinians' history. It 
said that those who signed the agreement "do not represent our 
people," and the agreement is not binding on the Palestinians. 
  A statement issued by the movement said what happened in 
Cairo "is a cheap sellout of the homeland represented in a weak 
and disfigured self-administration controlled by Zionist 
domination and sovereignty." 
  Having pointed out that the agreement "is not binding" on 
the 
Palestinian people and that those who signed it "do not 
represent them," the movement urged "all Palestinian factions 
and influential figures to unite their efforts to oppose this 
sinister agreement...and not to be dragged in any way into 
violence or fighting among brothers of one people." 
  Concluding, the statement said that the agreement "will not 
represent the end of history, because no treaties are going to 
abolish the Palestinian people's claim to their homeland and 
holy places. One day our people will tear up this agreement, 
just as they have torn up all documents of abandonment 
throughout history."

  [Text] The Central Committee of the Arab Liberation Front 
[ALF] has condemned the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
between the PLO and the Zionist entity. 
  A spokesman for the ALF Central Committee has stated that 
the 
ALF condemns this agreement, announces that it rejects it, and 
that it will not comply with all that results from it. This is 
because this agreement is the result of successive concessions 
that began at Madrid and continued until the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement was reached. 
  The statement [as heard] said: We are confident that such 
agreements cannot cancel our historic right to our entire 
homeland or prevent our people from continuing their struggle as 
part of a comprehensive Arab confrontation that will undoubtedly 
come under the banner of the immortal Mother of Battles led by 
the nation's knight and hero and the Arab mujahid leader, Saddam 
Husayn.

  [Text] London: Quds Press--A former PLO Executive 
Committee member has termed yesterday's agreement launching 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho; unfair. Shafiq al-Hut, the PLO's 
representative in Beirut, told Quds Press "the agreement puts 
the Palestinian people's fate and cause on the line." 
  Al-Hut, who resigned his PLO membership to protest the 
September signing of the Declaration of Principles agreement, 
criticized the results of arduous negotiations between the 
Palestinians and Israelis. The agreements that spelled out the 
declaration of principles have confirmed the opponents of the 
Oslo accord in their assessment that there has been a climbdown 
on key issues. Al-Hut said that, initially, the Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat balked at signing the detailed annexes 
of the agreement seeing that they had unforessen concessions 
that took him by surprise, thus pointing up the existence of 
differences blocking a final deal.

  [Text] Beirut, 5 May (MENA)--The PLO will be taking steps 
to withdraw its weapons and armed men from Lebanon and to 
eliminate all evidence of its military and semi-military 
presence on Lebanese territories. 
  Palestinian sources have said that the PLO will withdraw 
between 200 and 500 Fatah members in the first stage along with 
weapons and military equipment. 
  The sources added that they expect the Lebanese army to 
deploy in the areas where the Palestinian camps are situated 
with the aim of strengthening the state's authority over all the 
areas in Lebanon.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan Sultan, member of the Palestinian </F>
Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, by Kawthar 
Salam; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Q: What is your evaluation of the current economic 
situation in the occupied territories today? 
  A: The economic situation is very difficult and 
embarrassing. The circumstances in which we are now, with the 
closure of the occupied territories, the curfews, the inability 
of people to commute or reach Jerusalem, and the prohibition of 
laborers to reach their places of work in Israel, have paralyzed 
the whole situation in a way never seen before in our area. 
Shops have closed and factories are empty, becoming a burden to 
their owners. The people have become a consumer society using 
their savings if they have any. 
  The loss to our economy is between $6-7 million daily, not 
to 
mention the mental stress through which the people are going. 
  Q: What about the economic loss in Hebron? 
  A: The situation in Hebron is a little different, and the 
losses there are worse than in all other parts of the occupied 
territories combined. The daily losses in Hebron alone, during 
the closure, have been $2 million, and the overall effect is 
very visible. 
  Q: What are the necessary requirements to develop the 
Palestinian economy in the next stage? 
  A: The requirements could be summarized in the following 
points: 
  1. Political and social stability. Giving the people the 
freedom to make their own choices politically and economically. 
This is one of the most important elements for the development 
of the Palestinian economic situation. When they are given the 
freedom to choose, then more doors are open to them, and they 
have the opportunity to develop economically. 
  2. Organizing the infrastructure of the Palestinian 
authority and its public and primary institutions so that it 
will be ready to operate. 
  3. Determining the legal framework and required legislation 
for the economic and social activities that will give 
Palestinians the opportunity to lay down social and economic 
laws that are required for economic development. 
  4. Continuing the development of human and natural resources 
to provide an effective basis for economic activities, which 
includes raising the standards of the Palestinian individuals in 
all domains, knowing that the availability of human resources is 
very important. 
  5. Concentrating on the financial infrastructure for the 
Palestinian economy, as well as the social infrastructure, and 
limiting priorities, such as correction of the health situation, 
water networks, sewage systems, roads, modes of transportation 
and power networks. 
  Setting up a strong industrial base in the West Bank and 
Gaza 
Strip, which includes support for the already existing 
industries, and at the same time, develop new industries. 
  Expanding housing developments to absorb the growing 
population and those returning from the diaspora. 
  Encouraging the export sector and finding the necessary 
support services for that sector. 
  Expanding and developing the agriculture sector including 
the 
livestock sector. 
  Developing the Palestinian countryside, which in turn will 
create jobs for the unemployed as well as providing educational, 
health and entertainment services, so that the countryside will 
start attracting people. 
  Organizing the financial sector to serve those investing in 
the economy through different institutions. 
  6. Strengthening Palestinian economic ties with the other 
Arab countries and the world, and opening new markets in order 
to promote and sell various Palestinian goods. 
  7. Using natural resources to the maximum. 
  It is also important to let all Palestinians, inside and 
outside the occupied territories, invest in the infrastructure 
and facilitate the opportunities for those abroad, in terms of 
tax reductions and so on. 
  Q: How do we achieve Palestinian economic independence in 
the transitional period? 
  A: There is a Palestinian plan for development until the 
year 2000. If implemented according to all economic principles, 
it will be a good start for an independent Palestinian economy. 
I think that in the absence of occupation and with the presence 
of a Palestinian authority, economic independence from the 
Israelis will follow. It will give the Palestinians the 
opportunity to develop and take charge of themselves. 
  Q: Do you see any dangers facing the Palestinian economy in 
terms of the funding which has been pledged by various 
institutions and countries? 
  A: There are studies which deal with the needs of the 
Palestinian economy, the most important of which are the ones 
done by the World Bank and the Palestinian plan for development 
until the year 2000. This plan will take an estimated $12 
billion. 
  There are promises from the World Bank and some countries to 
support the latter plan depending on its priorities. Several 
agreements were signed in regards to it. 
  Some EC countries have also shown their willingness to 
support certain projects. Some of the support will be in the 
form of grants and some in the form of loans without any strings 
attached. If used correctly, this money will aid in building 
the economy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Significance of the Signing of the </F>
Agreement"] 
  [Text] It can be said that with the signing of the 
agreement on implementing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles in Cairo yesterday by Palestinian leader Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin a new stage in 
the history of the Palestinian people has begun. This stage 
will have repercussions -- which hopefully will be positive -- 
on the overall situation in the region, although this will 
definitely depend on subsequent developments, whether in terms 
of the Israeli side's approach in implementing the agreement 
objectively and reasonably or in terms of local and internal 
Palestinian, Arab, and even Israeli positions. 
  For example, on the Palestinian level the new agreement 
requires a maximal spirit of positive citizenship, a sense of 
responsibility, and a realization that the stage which the 
Palestinian people have entered is actually fundamentally 
different from previous stages in their history. 
  Now the entire world is watching to see how the Palestinians 
will deal with the opportunity that has been given to them to 
prove that they not only deserve this opportunity but also that 
they can exploit it well. If the Palestinian people's sons 
prove their competence and their social, political, and 
civilized cohesion, this will convince the international 
community -- enemies more than friends -- that the Palestinian 
people are worthy of the legitimate rights which they are 
demanding. 
  The Palestinians alone do not bear the future consequences 
of 
the agreement. The Israeli side, which possesses the powers of 
implementation and -- if it so desires -- the ability to place 
temporary or sometimes permanent obstacles, is more than a 
partner in determining the agreement's future. Negotiations are 
still being held over some pending issues in the agreement 
itself despite the fact that the two sides have signed the 
agreement. In reality, there are many Israeli practices that 
encumber the residents and do not conform with the agreement's 
spirit. Among these are the continued closure of Jerusalem to 
the occupied territories' residents, the Israeli authorities' 
delay in releasing thousands of Palestinian prisoners, the 
measures imposed on Hebron since the al- Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre, and the preventing of the majority of Palestinian 
workers from reaching their work places inside the Green Line. 
  Despite all the negative points, the agreement reached 
through intensive efforts by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak 
and his government, the sponsorship of the United States and 
Russia, and the participation of Norway and other European 
Community countries and international powers represents -- 
according to the consensus of the international community -- a 
good prospect for launching a new era of peace and coexistence. 
Also, according to the Palestinian concept, the agreement 
constitutes an initial step toward the achievement of the 
Palestinian people's legitimate demands. From this premise, it 
is the difficult beginning of a long march requiring cooperation 
and unity for reaching the aspired for inalienable goals.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Peace Speeches"] </F>
  [Text] The high-sounding speeches that we heard yesterday 
during the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement in Cairo 
consisted of empty rhetoric to camouflage the reality that what 
was agreed on neither responds to the Palestinian people's 
legitimate aspirations nor contributes to the achievement of 
security, safety, justice, and peace, either in the long-term or 
short-term. 
  General talk about peace, security, and prosperity is of no 
benefit when the agreement's provisions are filled with mines 
and with everything that is liable to reduce the chances of a 
just settlement. Moreover, resorting to glittering slogans that 
talk about the Arab character of Jerusalem and rejection of 
settlements mean nothing when the speaker himself is prepared to 
peddle an agreement that neither guarantees Jerusalem's Arab 
character nor puts an end to settlement activity. 
  In this context we have to recall al-Sadat's ringing speech 
from the Knesset's podium several years ago and how this speech 
established nothing but the Camp David approach and how it 
failed to contribute at all to the expansion of a peace coveted 
by all the region's peoples. 
  Will we be far from the truth if we say that the "peace" 
speeches that we heard yesterday are copies of al-Sadat's speech 
without any additions or subtractions?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "On the Threshold of a New Stage] </F>
  [Text] Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will meet today in Cairo to put the final 
touches to the agreement on implementing the Declaration of 
Principles. All evidence indicates that the few issues left for 
the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships will be resolved, 
allowing for the agreement to be signed tomorrow as scheduled. 
  With the signing of the agreement, heavy responsibilities 
and 
burdens will be placed on the shoulders of the Palestinians. 
These are epitomized by the powers and authorities that will be 
transferred to the Palestinians in the Palestinian transitional 
rule area and by the management of their own affairs in various 
spheres. This is an extremely difficult task, requiring a great 
deal of awareness and maturity, in addition to scientific, 
management, and technical expertise and skills. 
  The Palestinians definitely do not suffer from a shortage of 
capabilities and expertise to run their own affairs and manage 
various aspects of their lives. Now that they are facing the 
first challenges of assuming certain security and management 
powers and authorities in the self-rule area, in addition to 
other powers that will be handed over to them in the West Bank, 
they realize well the heavy responsibilities and duties placed 
on their shoulders and are aware of the dangers and 
repercussions that might stem from their performance during the 
stage they are about to enter. 
  No one can doubt the ability of the Palestinian people to 
pass the next test and overcome the coming crucial challenges. 
The process of a full century of struggle to obtain national 
rights and the ensuing experience and sacrifices have taught the 
Palestinians the meaning of affiliation to society. 
Undoubtedly, the apprehension and anticipation dominating the 
feelings of the Palestinians at this time will disappear with 
the beginning of serious work to construct the expected entity. 
This construction must take place within the framework of 
sincere national affiliation and of placing the supreme interest 
above any other consideration, as well as of dialogue and mutual 
respect of opinions, the supremacy of objective and rational 
concepts, and the proper democratic spirit. 
  In brief, with their wisdom and efforts and by being open to 
the world around them, the Palestinians are able to silence the 
skeptical voices that are rising now, especially from the 
Israeli side, and which are betting in advance on the 
Palestinians' inability to cope with the task that will be 
handed over to them. Certainly, the task is not easy, but the 
issue concerns the Palestinian people's continuing march, which 
must move forward regardless of the cost, effort, and sacrifices.

  [Text] Brother Abu-al-Adib [Salim al-Za'nun], acting 
speaker of the National Council, received the delegation of the 
UN fact-finding commission at his office yesterday afternoon . 
  After brother Abu-al-Adib reviewed the latest developments 
of 
the peace process in Gaza and Jericho, he said that despite the 
commencement of the peace process and the achievement of the 
peace agreement, the Israeli authorities were still imposing an 
economic blockade and security cordon on the West Bank and 
Jerusalem. Brother Abu-al-Adib stressed that the Palestinian 
authority would be extremely eager to preserve human rights and 
liberties there. He also stressed the need for the World Bank 
and the donor countries to be committed to the support of the 
Palestinian economy and the creation of job opportunities for 
thousands of unemployed as a result of the occupation policies. 
  Brother Abu-al-Adib then listened to a briefing on the 
fact-finding commission's task from its chairman, Stanley 
Kalpage, the permanent representative of the Repubic of Sri 
Lanka at the United Nations, who said that they were visiting 
the countries neighboring Israel to investigate the Israeli 
authorities' practices and its breaches of human rights. He 
added that Israel was not cooperating with the commission and 
would not allow it to enter Israel or the occupied Arab 
territories to find out about the Israeli authorities treatment 
of the Palestinian population there. It is to be recalled that 
the commission today visited wounded from the Hebron massacre at 
the Al-Husayn medical complex.

  [Text] A source at the General People's Committee for Unity 
has made the following statement: 
  Faced with the serious escalation of events in sister Yemen 
and the crisis between brothers, which has claimed many victims 
and has led to bloodshed and the start of a spiral of violence, 
we are aware of our pan-Arab responsibility to preserve Yemeni 
unity which is a gain for the Arab nation and which should not 
be given up. This unity should be preserved and reinforced, and 
an end should be put to the in-fighting. Such is the goal which 
the brother leader of the 1 September Revolution [Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi] has endeavored to achieve with his continuous 
efforts to bring about reconciliation and protect unionist 
gains, particularly under the current circumstances in the Arab 
region and the world and in view of the challenges facing our 
Arab nation. 
  Therefore, the duty is to spare the Yemeni Arab people the 
tragedies resulting from an armed conflict, to resort to reason, 
and to choose the path of dialogue in order to implement the 
Pledge and Accord document and also to respond to the will of 
the Yemeni Arab people to preserve unity and reject in-fighting 
and the collapse of this unity, which benefits only the enemies 
of unity and the enemies of the Arab nation. 
  The unionists and pan-Arabists today have the historical 
responsibility to preserve the Yemeni unity, which we regard as 
a prelude to the unity of the Arab nation, to protect its 
existence and safeguard its independence. 
  The General People's Committee for Unity in the Great 
Jamahiriyah calls on the Yemeni leaderships, who have achieved 
unity, to make efforts to preserve that unity for this is an 
historical responsibility which they should assume.

  [Text] The JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY's Arab affairs editor 
has said that the United Nations has failed to implement any of 
its resolutions against the racist Israeli entity that occupies 
Arab Palestine and other Arab territories. The editor pointed 
out that the so-called Security Council has passed roughly 50 
resolutions on Palestine. Most of them have been calling for 
the withdrawal of the Israelis from the occupied Arab 
territories, be it southern Lebanon, the Golan, or others. 
However, none of these resolutions have ever been implemented; 
they have been rejected by the Israelis who showed them contempt. 
  The Arab affairs editor wondered why the United Nations has 
not implemented any of its resolutions regarding the racist 
Israeli entity saying: Why has the United Nations not returned 
the territories of those Arab states that happened to be UN 
members. These territories were seized by force by the racist 
Israelis who decided to annex them and change their demographic, 
cultural, and political character--a matter that has contravened 
recognized norms. The editor also indicated that the Israeli 
entity has exploited the UN failure to put pressure on those 
concerned Arab parties. It obliged these parties to recognize 
Israel's racist and alien existence in exchange for its 
so-called withdrawal from the Arab lands that it has occupied. 
This condition constitutes an insult to the Arab countries 
whose land has been occupied. The Arab affairs editor concluded 
his comments by saying that real peace would not come to the 
region except with the return of the Palestinian people to their 
land and homes, the departure of the Israeli invaders and their 
return to where they came from, and the establishment of a 
democratic state in Palestine. Without this, peace in the 
region will remain delusion, fantasy, and unrealistic.

  [Text] Algeria expresses satisfaction at the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement that was signed in Cairo yesterday 
on the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied 
territories. 
  A Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman considers this 
agreement 
to be important and a new qualitative phase on the road to a 
just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East issue, 
which takes into account the legitimate rights of the 
Palestinian people and their sovereignty, and their right to 
establish an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman adds that Algeria, 
which renews its complete solidarity with Syria, Jordan and 
Lebanon, is of the view that the peace process in the region 
necessarily requires the unconditional Israeli withdrawal from 
all occupied Arab territories.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh Mahfoud Nahnah, leader of the </F>
Algerian Islamic Society Movement, by Kamil al-Tawil in London 
"the day before yesterday"] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Tawil] What is your opinion of the Mokdad 
Sifi government? 
  [Nahnah] We had hoped the Algerian authorities would not 
form a government until national accord had been achieved among 
men of the political class. We had also hoped that this 
government would be a coalition government that contributed 
effectively to resolving the crisis. But Mokdad Sifi's 
government came after it had become clear that the former 
government (led by Redha Malek) had resorted to escalation 
through the anti-terrorism law, whose implementation involved 
numerous excesses. Besides, the former government considered 
itself the heir of the authorities or the real partner of the 
existing authorities in the country. This is why the state's 
rhetoric was two-faced and aroused despair among those wishing 
to conduct a dialogue. 
  The Sifi government's arrival has given an impetus to the 
process of national accord, dialogue, and reconciliation which 
the former government opposed, whereas the head of state was 
working for it. We are awaiting the government's economic and 
social program so that we can define our position on it. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Al-Tawil] Are you making contacts to coordinate with the 
parties which believe in dialogue in Algeria? 
  [Nahnah] We always try to make contacts with sincere people 
who are alarmed by the terrorism practiced against citizens, the 
killing of innocent people, and the stealing of public money. 
These incidents should prompt everyone to work to break down the 
psychological barriers and establish common denominators in 
order to agree on a minimum program. 
  [Al-Tawil] Has Boukhamkham had any contacts with you? 
  [Nahnah] All I know about the release of brothers Djeddi and 
Boukhamkham is that they were released under an agreement with 
the authorities and with the top leadership of the Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS] inside prison. They have authorization so 
that their actions will at least be legal. In releasing them 
the authorities have offered part of a down payment. It had 
been hoped that they would make contacts in several spheres, 
including the armed groups level, the political class level, and 
the authorities level. The aim was for the two officials to 
contain the hotbeds of violence to the best of their ability. 
But it seems that since their release in mid-Ramadan [last week 
in February] they have been unable to expand the circle of their 
contacts to include all influential figures. Some armed groups 
accuse them sometimes of being agents and of treason. We 
condemn these accusations leveled at two people who have 
struggled for a long time for the sake of the [Islamic] call and 
political action. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Tawil] Have you made contacts with the FIS? 
  [Nahnah] The people who have not been implicated in violence 
-- including those in prison, shura council members, or those 
who won the (canceled) elections -- contact us from time to 
time. There are contacts between us and them. Some ask our 
opinion; others do not. We are advocates of dialogue and 
understanding. We are opposed to excluding some people because 
of their political ideology and principles. 
  [Al-Tawil] Is Algeria actually moving toward civil war? 
  [Nahnah] The problem is that there are some people who 
exaggerate Algeria's problem, and others who play down the 
problem. Algeria is suffering a crisis. But it is an 
exaggeration to say that it has entered a civil war. The 
country is suffering what can be termed sedition. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Al-Tawil] How do you justify your agreement to join the 
transitional assembly when you said that the dialogue should be 
held with those who won the canceled elections? 
  [Nahnah] Algeria is experiencing a fire, and to avoid 
shouldering responsibility it to avoid performing a duty. We 
cannot see a sick person dying and then say we cannot give him 
medicine until a specialist doctor arrives. We set several 
conditions for the transitional phase, including shortening it 
as much as possible. And we believe that the way out of the 
crisis is to hold elections and announce a schedule for them in 
order to assure everyone that the country is following a 
pluralist road. 
  We also call on the FIS to contribute to extinguishing this 
fire. When we talk about the FIS, we are talking about 
citizens. Not all FIS supporters carry weapons or are reckless 
or foolish. In the FIS there are wise people and people of 
politics. So we hope that the people of politics will play a 
role. We also call on the authorities to accept these people in 
the transitional institutions in order to guarantee curbing the 
violence which has continued for long. [passage omitted] 
  The FIS should announce that it is not behind the operations 
aimed against citizens in general, including policemen, traders, 
journalists, professors, intellectuals, politicians, and Foreign 
Ministry employees. Because what is happening is going to 
generate grudges that will continue for many years. 
  [Al-Tawil] What is your opinion of the dialogue method 
pursued by President Zeroual? 
  [Nahnah] It is serious but not useful 
  [Al-Tawil] You always focus on dialogue and the need for it. 
Have tried to make contacts or meet with Abassi Madani? 
  [Nahnah] I submitted a request (to meet with Madani), but 
the authorities have not responded. My request still stands. 
With a group of influential politicians in the country, I also 
offered to form a delegation to meet with those held in prison 
(FIS leaders) or those under house arrest, or after their 
release, in order to agree on a minimum program that contributes 
to reviving hope. The request still stands and we hope it will 
be met. 
  [Al-Tawil] Why do you believe the request has been turned 
down? 
  [Nahnah] The authorities have begun their dialogue at the 
defense minister (Zeroual) level with FIS leaders inside prison. 
They heve also conducted a dialogue with the parties.

  [Text] Algiers, May. 05 (MAP) -- Two leaders of the 
outlawed Islamic Salvation Front `FIS' who were released last 
February said `bloodshed will stop in Algeria if there is proof 
that authorities will not hamper the project of an Islamic state 
and confiscate free choice of people'. 
  The two FIS leaders who granted an interview to pro-Islamic 
AL BAYANE daily said those who were forced to take arms for 
political reasons will end up opting for a way that will spare 
the lives of Muslims, restore security and faith, respect the 
nation's will to change and end injustice affecting innocent 
people. To a question on whether armed wings will comply to the 
Islamic party's eventual call to lay down arms, Abdelkader 
Boukhemkhem and Ali Jeddi said the FIS leaders strongly believe 
that their move will yield results because it is based on the 
charia (Islamic law) and on the people's trust as well as on 
cooperation with reformist forces of the country. 
  The two men who were sentenced to 4 years imprisonment 
proposed four requisites likely, in their opinion, to bring 
about a climate favorable to the quest of solution: `ending 
injustice affecting people, lifting restrictions imposed on 
political freedom and information, charity and daawa (Islamic 
call) moves, lifting all obstacles preventing the FIS from 
undertaking its civilizational mission and restore to people the 
right to have a say'. 
  They also voiced optimism that Algeria will overcome the 
crisis if the authorities meet requests of parties which enjoy 
popular credibility. For the two men, there are fundamental 
convergences on the assessment of the situation among the FIS 
leadership, five major political parties, ulema (Islamic 
scholars) and political figures.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Foreign Ministry; date not given]- </F>
  [Text] Following the signing of the agreement on self-rule 
between the Palestinians and the Israelis, the Foreign Ministry 
has issued the following statement: 
  Tunisia has noted with satisfaction today's signing between 
the PLO chairman and the Israeli prime minister on the agreement 
to implement the Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, 
which should initiate the implementation of the Declaration of 
Principles signed in Washington on 13 September 1993, bolster 
the peace process in the Middle East, and which is an important 
step toward a just and comprehensive solution in order to 
guarantee the legitimate rights of the struggling fraternal 
Palestinian people and its right to lead a dignified life in a 
sovereign state. 
  Tunisia, which has always been tireless in maintaining and 
consolidating the independence of the Palestinian 
decision-makers, supporting the Palestinian people's just cause, 
and following up the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, is hoping 
that the new agreement will give fresh momentum to continue the 
peace process at all costs in order to bring about the total 
Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and peace 
in the region in accordance with the UN resolution and 
international legality.

  [Text] Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] Secretary 
General Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid expressed his deep satisfaction and 
welcoming of the signing in Cairo of the agreement between the 
PLO and Israel on the implementation of the agreement on 
transitional self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  In a statement today, he said that this agreement was an 
important turning point in the history of the Palestinian people 
and a decisive step in the course of its just struggle, during 
which immense sacrifices were made toward the achievement of its 
legitimate rights including the right to return, the right to 
self determination, and the setting up of its independent 
Palestinian state on its national territory with Jerusalem as 
its capital. 
  The secretary general welcomed the courageous and wise steps 
taken by the PLO under the leadership of His Excellency 
President Yasir 'Arafat in defense of the proud Palestinian 
people's rights and interests during this stage of hard talks. 
  Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid stressed the Muslim nation's fundamental 
and constant support of the Palestinian people in its fight to 
regain its basic national rights. 
  He called on the international community to provide all 
forms 
of support to the Palestinian people during this historic period 
of constructing and developing its vital utilities and 
infrastructure and its national social and economic institutions 
as the fundamental pillars for its national authority on its 
land, thus bolstering security and stability in the region. 
  The ICO secretary general praised the efforts made by all 
parties to the peace process that contributed toward achieving 
this agreement, particularly the efforts made by Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak in this regard as well as the peace 
process cosponsors, the United States and Russia. He called on 
them to continue their efforts in order to achieve tangible 
progress on all other Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese peace 
tracks in a way that will guarantee a full Israeli withdrawal 
from all occupied Arab territories and the establishment of a 
comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East on the basis of 
international legitimacy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the wake of the recent baseless accusations 
raised by the British mass media concerning the Islamic Republic 
of Iran's material and moral support for the Irish Republican 
Army, the IRA, and implicit conformation of these baseless 
allegations by some British officials, once again Tehran-London 
relations have been pushed to the brink of a difficult political 
crisis. Resolution of this crisis is not predictable owing to 
British leaders' lack of political independence. [passage 
omitted] 
  From the viewpoint of domestic and foreign experts the 
critical situation prevalent in Britain is closely linked with 
London's fresh charge against the Islamic Republic of Iran. It 
is also construed as a preplanned political and propaganda 
offensive in order to divert the attention of the people of 
Britain from the failures suffered by its Conservative 
government in its domestic and foreign policies. [passage 
omitted] 
  Albert Reynolds, the president of the Irish Republic, too, 
in 
implicitly dismissing the British Government claim on alleged 
cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IRA, 
has pointed out that so far no firm documents or evidence have 
been presented to him concerning such cooperation. 
  This statement of the Irish president, and also a clear-cut 
assertion by the Irish Foreign Ministry spokesman to the effect 
that Ireland is continuing its efforts to boost economic ties 
and also a current trend on understanding and exchange between 
Tehran and Dublin and that Ireland is not inclined at all to 
undermine this reciprocal understanding, all point to just one 
thing. They show the reality that British statesmen have failed 
in a new round of their efforts to pressure Iran. Hence they 
must, once again, face the undesirable result of their 
counselling with the U.S. policies against the Islamic 
revolution. 
  In a reference to the U.S. Administration's reaction to 
Britain's baseless claim on Iran's alleged cooperation with the 
IRA would clearly show the collusion between Washington and 
London. [sentence as heard] Last week, or few days before the 
start of this fresh clamor by the government of John Major, U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher paid a visit to London, 
and when this political and propaganda offensive was initiated 
by Britain against Iran the head of the U.S. diplomacy was in 
Cairo. While in the Egyptian capital, Christopher, just moments 
after the assertion of this British claim against Iran, and even 
quicker than the procedure prevalent in diplomatic norms, said 
the issue shows that Iran must remain isolated and not get any 
share of economic aid from the West. This posturing was very 
controversial in the opinion of many analysts and experts in 
political affairs. It added to the notion that Christopher, 
prior to the start of this abortive offensive, had been briefed 
on the matter in the course of his British visit and had already 
made the necessary coordinations with the British leaders. 
[passage omitted] At any rate, in respect of the fact that the 
recent British claim against Iran points to London's political 
defeat in Northern Ireland, it also brings to memory yet another 
reality. Britain under the U.S. pressure has repeatedly acted 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran, and on each occasion has 
experienced the unfavorable outcome of this conflict more than 
any other country. Undoubtedly, this time too, it will gain 
nothing. 
  Early last autumn Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, 
prior to meeting with Iran's foreign minister, Dr. 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati, on the sidelines of the 48th UN General Assembly 
session had said: The agenda of my talks with Dr. Velayati will 
be difficult. Now, apparently, Mr. Hurd should respond to this 
question as to why the agenda of talks between Tehran and other 
political representatives of European capitals has never been 
that difficult. The response is quite evident. In the event, 
British statesmen, while disregarding the U.S. pressures, 
reassess their stands concerning bilateral ties and view the 
existing issues realistically. They will not find any major 
obstacle on the way of the expansion of Tehran-London relations. 
If this does not happen, then the vicious circle will continue 
indefinitely.

  [Text] During the Tehran Friday prayers -- prayers held 
simultaneously throughout the country with the participation of 
masses of worshippers at Friday prayer venues -- Ayatollah 
Yazdi, Tehran's interim Friday prayer imam, referred to the 
anniversary of the martyrdom of the worthy scholar and 
jurisconsult Ayatollah Motahhari and, honoring the memory of 
that martyr, described the specific traits of tha character of 
the great martyr Mortaza Motahhari. He said that an 
understanding of the times and its exigencies as well as action 
on the basis of that understanding are among the outstanding 
traits of that martyred personality, scholar Motahhari. 
  Praising the approval of a bill on general and revolutionary 
courts by the Islamic Consultative Majles, Yazdi described the 
special aspects of that bill. Continuing his sermons, he 
described the British allegation of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran's support for the IRA as a false claim. He added: As the 
person responsible for the state judiciary system I call on 
British statesmen to put forward any evidence they may have. 
  Tehran's interim Friday prayer imam also condemned the 
compromising accord concluded with the Zionist regime by 
'Arafat. He stressed: Such an accord cannot trample on the 
indisputable rights of a nation. He added: 'Arafat is not the 
Palestinian nation and cannot embark on any action in the name 
of the Palestinian nation. He added: We are certain that the 
combatant and honorable Palestinian nation, especially the 
intifadah, will not remain silent in the face of that compromise 
and will continue its struggle till it achieves its indisputable 
right. 
  Ayatollah Yazdi also offered his congratulations for the 
victory of the people of South Africa against the racist South 
African regime. He described it as the fall of racism. 
  Criticizing the silence of the international forums with 
regard to the Gorazde issue, Tehran's interim Friday imam added: 
The behavior of the United Nations and the Security Council 
regarding that issue has dealt the strongest blow to the 
credibility of that organization. Referring to the support and 
assistance given by the people of our country to the Bosnian 
people, he expressed the hope for that assistance to continue.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] The agreement on the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord was signed yesterday while the combatant 
Palestinian groups expressed their opposition to it. With the 
signing of this accord, which defines the manner of implementing 
a limited autonomy for the Palestinians in Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip, the Israeli forces will withdraw from these areas and 
delegate their control to Palestinian policemen. 
  After the Arab-Israeli war in 1967, these areas were 
occupied 
by the Zionist forces. The signatories of the Gaza-Jericho 
accord and their main supporters are seeking to magnify the 
importance of the signing of the accord as an end to the Middle 
East crisis and a solution to the Palestine issue. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is in the 
Middle East to consolidate the process of compromise and was 
present at the signing of the document on the implementation of 
the Gaza-Jericho accord, lauded it as a historic accord. He 
added that it indicates that the two sides are in favor of 
putting the era of war and violence behind them, which engulfed 
the area for many years. 
  'Arafat described this accord as an infrastructure for peace 
in the region, and the Zionist regime's prime minister said it 
would pave the way for peace. The combatant Palestinian groups 
proclaimed a day of mourning and a general strike and declared 
today a black day. They have openly displayed their opposition 
to the Gaza-Jericho accord and have stressed the continuation of 
their struggle until the vindication of the true rights of the 
Palestinians. 
  The factor that has motivated the authors of the 
Gaza-Jericho 
accord to view it as a means to put the Middle East conflict 
behind them is that they believe that by propounding a limited 
autonomy plan in this region they have catered to the 
Palestinian wishes for an independent government and have doused 
their fervor for a Palestinian homeland. 
  The Islamic nature of the Palestinian territories is a 
strong 
reality that has retained its luster despite the years of 
occupation and the homelessness of its citizens and efforts to 
destroy their identity. On the basis of this reality, the 
establishment of an independent government, which should reflect 
this identity, is a historical demand of the Palestinians that 
must be achieved or struggles will continue. 
  In view of this irrefutable reality, the formulators of this 
compromise have attempted to delegate a small segment of the 
Palestinian homeland with limited autonomy to placate the people 
of Palestine and the world. It remains to be seen whether the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord can bring about peace 
and compromise between the Zionist regime and the Palestinian 
people. 
  The Palestinians seek the establishment of a government that 
protects and upholds all Palestinian characteristics, embraces 
the entire Palestinian population, encompasses the entire 
historical Palestinian homeland, and enjoys complete and 
comprehensive sovereignty. The autonomy propounded on the basis 
of the compromise between 'Arafat and the Zionist regime does 
not have any of these characteristics. This will result in 
opposition by a large section of the Palestinian population. 
The declaration of opposition by the Palestinian groups and a 
general strike by the intifadah commanders on the day the 
document for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord was 
signed is eloquent testimony of this fact. 
  On the other hand, in light of the expansionist nature of 
the 
Zionist regime, one can say that it does not even consider 
itself obligated to abide by the limited agreements in the 
accord signed. The killings of Muslim worshipers in the 
al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque proved that this regime, along with 
those participating in the talks, constantly gives vent to its 
savage nature so that it can restrict the Palestinian Muslims 
even more. The massacre of Muslims by the Zionists took place 
when this regime constantly referred to the Palestinian people's 
struggles as extremist actions that disrupt the so-called peace 
process. The Zionist regime calls on the obsequious leaders of 
the compromise to rein in these actions. 
  Thus, it may be said that despite the signing of the 
compromising accord the Zionist regime ignores it whenever it 
deems fit so that it can attain its expansionist objectives. 
What is obvious is that the Palestinian issue can only be 
resolved when a government that reflects the Palestinian 
identity of the people of these territories is established with 
complete integrity and the holy land of Jerusalem is liberated 
completely from the occupation by the Zionist usurpers. 
Otherwise, the Palestinian nation and the Islamic world will 
not relinquish their demands and the defeat of plans such as the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, which was established on unstable 
foundations, will be imminent.

  [Text] Pakistan's Interior Minister Nasrullah Khan Babar 
and Giacomelli, the UN executive under secretary-general and 
chairman of the Anti-Narcotics Committee, were received by 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani today. 
  At the meeting the president expressed his pleasure with the 
consultation, cooperation, and joint efforts of Iran and 
Pakistan in combatting the cursed phenomenon of narcotics on the 
common border and in the region. He also described as very 
positive the UN's support for the successful implementation of 
joint measures. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the fact that over the past 
few years the Islamic Republic of Iran has been in the vanguard 
of the fight against contraband narcotics in the region. He 
stressed that the comprehensive fight against the big 
international narcotics gangs, which have advanced facilities 
and equipment, requires the cooperation and coordinated joint 
effort of all neighboring countries. 
  The president said that the venomous propaganda by certain 
Western media, and even some institutes affiliated to the United 
Nations about Iran's efforts to fight the merchants of death 
stems from the infiltration of the world's propaganda centers by 
big international narcotics smuggling gangs. He said: While 
Iran is combatting the merchants of death in the region at great 
expense, certain so-called human rights institutions, with the 
help of their influential propaganda centers, paint Iran's 
humanitarian efforts with the same brush as their own political 
prejudices and describe the execution of narcotics smugglers as 
the execution of political dissidents and a contravention of 
human rights. He said: Iran will not deviate from its chosen 
path despite these allegations. Iran's law enforcement and 
military personnel will fight this cursed phenomenon with 
decisiveness and will support the actions of other countries in 
the matter. 
  At the meeting, the UN executive under secretary-general and 
chairman of the Anti-Narcotics Committee expressed his pleasure 
at Iran's progress in the fight against narcotics. He said: In 
our inspection of the common border between Iran, Pakistan, and 
Afghanistan, I and the team accompanying me saw the diligent 
efforts of Iran's law enforcement forces to combat the narcotics 
smugglers. We will place at the UN's disposal comprehensive 
information on those humanitarian efforts. 
  He added: Iran's efforts in the matter should not only be 
praised by international forums but it should be presented to 
the rest of the world as a model. 
  Supporting the joint efforts of Iran and Pakistan to combat 
narcotics smuggling, he said: There is no doubt that fighting 
this cursed global phenomenon, which causes murder, corrupts 
youngsters, and pollutes the environment requires all-round 
international effort. All other countries, particularly 
regional countries, must use Iran's and Pakistan's joint efforts 
as a model and continue their efforts to combat narcotics 
jointly and comprehensively. 
  Later in the meeting, which was also attended by Interior 
Minister Besharati and a number of our country's law enforcement 
officials, the Pakistani interior minister thanked the Iranian 
authorities for their efforts in the fight against narcotics 
smuggling. He described his talks with his Iranian counterpart 
as very fruitful, and added: We hope that with the measures 
taken to safeguard the common border the fight against narcotics 
and the merchants of death will be continued even more seriously 
in the future.

  [Text] Tehran, May 5, IRNA -- Minister of Finance and 
Economic Affairs, Morteza Mohammad-Khan said on Thursday that 
the share of taxes in the Gross National Product (GNP) was five 
percent. 
  Addressing a group of Finance Ministry director generals 
from 
throughout the country, Mohammad-Khan said it was necessary that 
simpler methods be adopted for collection of taxes. 
  He said that in the past calendar year, 1372 (March 
1993-March 1994) the Finance Ministry had collected rls. 4,000 
billion in direct and indirect taxes and that the figure was 
expected to reach rls. 7,800 billion this year. 
  Mohammad-Khan said in the past year taxes made up one-sixth 
of the country's budget, adding that the ratio would rise to one 
fifth this year. 
  Since the country's revenue is provided through oil export, 
borrowing from domestic and foreign banks and collecting taxes 
from high income people was the best form of economic adjustment 
plan. He said that in the course of the 1988-94 economic 
development plan, non-oil exports had an eye-catching rise so 
much so that it reached dlrs four billion last year. 
  The emphasis put by the first economic development plan on 
production instead of import served to reduce the country's 
imports from 15 million tons in 1988 to five million tons 
annually at present, he said. 
  The finance minister predicted that the country will reach 
self-sufficiency in petrochemical sector by the end of this year 
and will no longer need to import petrochemicals. 
  Five million tons of steel will be produced by domestic 
steel 
mills by the end of 1373 (ending March 1995), 1.2 million tons 
of which would be exported, the minister said. 
  The average growth of Gross National Product (GNP) in the 
course of the first development plan stood at seven percent, he 
said. 
  The finance minister said that during the first five-year 
plan a total of dlrs 107 billion were invested in different 
economic areas, adding that oil revenues should be diverted 
towards investment so as to boost the country's economy.

  [Text] The foreign currency market was almost stagnant 
today and prices decreased compared to yesterday. The changes 
in the foreign currency market follow yesterday's decisions by 
the committee for regulating the foreign currency market. The 
committee announced that the state banking system will supply 
the foreign currency required by some importers at 50 rials less 
than current market prices. 
  The cabinet also decided in a session last night that, 
taking 
into account the decisions of the committee for regulating 
foreign currency, dealings with the foreign currency open market 
by any government establishment or establishments affiliated to 
the government in order to secure their required foreign 
currency will be illegal and any negligence by the banks during 
the currency allocation procedures will be deemed as 
collaboration with economic saboteurs. 
  Here is our correspondent with a report on the situation in 
the foreign currency market today: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] After the decision by the 
committee for regulating the foreign currency market to ban the 
purchase of dollars by government companies as well offering 
foreign currency to companies at prices lower than those on the 
open market, currency prices on the Tehran currency market fell 
by 100 to 150 rials per dollar last night. Today as well, 
prices are reduced by the same amount compared with yesterday's 
prices. 
  Right now I am at the Tehran foreign currency market. After 
last night's cabinet decision, currency dealings at the Tehran 
foreign currency market have almost stopped since this morning 
but at the new prices currency dealers are only buying and show 
no inclination to sell. 
  At the same time on the Tehran open foreign currency market 
currency dealings are stagnant and the market is quiet. At the 
moment each dollar is priced at 263 tumans which shows a 
decrease of 14 to 17 tumans compared with yesterday.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
issued another appeal to the Yemeni leaders to end the fighting. 
He warned of the grave consequences of the spreading 
confrontation between the armed forces in northern and southern 
Yemen and said that the situation is ominous and has been so 
since the start of the current crisis. 
  In his appeal, the president said: Wishing to avoid an armed 
confrontation among the sons of the Yemeni people, I called upon 
you repeatedly to exercise self-restraint, resort to reason, and 
seek understanding and reconciliation through dialogue. With 
this same motive, Egyptian mediation was and still is active. 
I have repeatedly warned of the dangers involved in a clash 
that would be difficult to contain. 
  President Mubarak said: I call on Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih to use the powers of his office in making the 
decisions necessary to end the current fighting in the country, 
separate the troops, and deflect the imminent danger the current 
strife portends for all Yemenis. 
  In his appeal, President Mubarak said that a decision to 
halt 
all military operations on both sides and separate the troops 
will thwart the designs of those who conspire against the sons 
of the Yemeni people and their unity and give dialogue, reason, 
and logic a chance to prevail. 
  President Mubarak added: I trust that President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih will side with the interests of the Yemeni 
people and stop the fighting before it turns into a full-fledged 
civil war that would engulf Yemen in great dangers and whose 
complications will be hard to control or reverse. President 
Mubarak said that everyone would place Yemeni interests above 
all considerations.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--Egypt has expressed its deep 
regret over the serious escalation in the struggle in Yemen. 
This was contained in a statement issued by the Egyptian 
Foreign Ministry today. 
  The Egyptian Foreign Ministry's statement said that halting 
the fighting in Yemen has become an urgent necessity, which 
Egypt demands anew. 
  The statement called on all Yemeni parties to refrain from 
attempting to impose a fait accompli by force, to give a chance 
to the efforts aimed at putting an end to the bloody clashes, 
and to spare the Yemeni people untold dangers. 
  The statement stressed that a wise and responsible dialogue 
is the correct way to settle differences and safeguard the 
interests of the fraternal Yemeni people. The statement 
explained that since the beginning of the crisis in Yemen, 
Egypt, led by President Husni Mubarak, has exerted intensive 
efforts to prevent the differences from worsening and to avert 
the impending dangers to Yemen's unity and its people's unity. 
  The statement said that in view of the deteriorating 
situation in Yemen in the past few hours, and that situation 
despite the mediation efforts, Egypt appeals to the warring 
factions to fully shoulder their responsibility before their 
people and nation, to stop the clashes immediately, and to 
realize that there will be no victors or vanquished. 
  The statement said the Yemeni people will be the ultimate 
losers who will suffer from the unleashing of the forces of 
confrontation and aggression and from the destruction that will 
befall Yemen.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
has stated the importance of the signing of the 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement to implement self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho, which took place in Cairo yesterday. 
  In remarks he made today, Musa described the agreement as 
"good," noting that it is the first step toward reaching a 
comprehensive solution for the Palestinian issue. Musa pointed 
out that the implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian self-rule 
agreement in Gaza and Jericho will begin in a week or two, with 
the return of Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and senior PLO 
officials. He noted that the first step will be implemented in 
Gaza and Jericho, to be followed by extending the Palestinian 
authority over the remaining Palestinian territory in the West 
Bank. He added: Other steps have been agreed upon and we hope 
the pace of the peace process will accelerate to reach the final 
stage as soon as possible and within two years of the 
implementation of the agreement. 
  Musa emphasized that any step toward achieving peace and 
stability in the region will have a positive impact on all the 
region's countries. He noted that Egypt is interested in 
establishing peace and stability in the region. He pointed out 
that if the Arab-Israeli conflict is resolved in accordance with 
the resolutions of the international community and through 
negotiations and agreements among the parties concerned, the 
region will undoubtedly enter a better stage. It will be a 
stage of cooperation and development in which the region's 
peoples can enjoy peace. 
  On U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent talks 
in Damascus, Musa noted that such meetings show Syria's interest 
in the U.S. role regarding the peace process. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--Dr. Han Wang-san, the South 
Korean president's envoy and former deputy prime minister [name 
and title as received], described his talks with President Husni 
Mubarak as fruitful and beneficial. 
  In exclusive statements he made to MENA this morning prior 
to 
his departure for Tanzania via Germany, he said that his visit 
to Egypt was to participate in the signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Agreement. [passage omitted] 
  In reply to a question, he said that he discussed with 
President Mubarak the question of raising South Korea's 
diplomatic representation in Cairo to the ambassadorial level. 
He added that President Mubarak showed an understanding of the 
situation and this issue will be discussed at the proper time. 
[passage omitted] 
  On Korea's aid to the Gaza-Jericho area, he said that his 
country has allocated around $12 million to help rebuild and 
develop this area's infrastructure in addition to another 
$200,000 allocated for preparing and equipping the Palestinian 
police. 
  On the situation in the Korean peninsula and the possibility 
of war in the region, the South Korean envoy said that North 
Korea will achieve a gain for itself and the region if it 
accepts nuclear inspection but will lose if it rejects this 
inspection. He added: North Korea has to balance between gain 
and loss and on the basis of this formula, the outbreak of war 
in the peninsula seems impossible, especially as North Korea is 
officially saying that it has no intention of developing nuclear 
weapons, does not have the capability to develop them, and has 
no intention of going to war. But if it rejects inspection, then 
this will create a major problem.

that the Egyptian security organs will contact U.S. authorities 
through Interpol to deport Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, the mufti 
of the al-Jihad Organization in Egypt, following the ruling of 
the Higher State Security Court-Emergency yesterday sentencing 
him to seven years at hard labor. 
  A security source said that the necessary measures will be 
taken to deport the defendant on the basis of the court's 
ruling. He added that there is coordination with the concerned 
authorities in the United States because of the absence of an 
extradition treaty between the two countries. The security 
source also stressed to the paper's correspondent 'Adil 
al-Suruji that countries take into consideration bilateral 
relations and the principle of equal treatment in such important 
cases. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Khalil] </F>
  [Excerpts] The talks between the Nasirists and the 
extremist groups has resumed following a seminar held by writer 
Fahmi Huwaydi and organized by the Nasirite Party. During the 
seminar, Huwaydi said he carried a message from the religious 
groups and the Islamic movement. Following the seminar, the 
Nasirite-Islamic meetings increased. 
  For some time [leading Nasarist] Farid 'Abd-al-Hakim has 
been 
promoting the idea of talks and coalition between the two sides. 
He has been in touch recently with jailed members of the 
extremist groups as one of their lawyers, along with Muntasir 
al-Zayyat. Lawyer Sayyid 'Abd-al-Fattah, who has been arrested 
in connection with the Salsabil case [computer company said to 
be connected with Muslim Brotherhood], attended these meetings. 
  During the meetings, the extremists claimed that their 
opinion of the Nasirists had changed and that now they consider 
them the closest political force to the general Islamic 
principles. They noted that they and the Nasirists now see eye 
to eye on most issues, particularly their stance on Israel and 
the West. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. 'Isam al-'Iryan, member of the Muslim Brotherhood, has 
stressed that the doors are open for dialogue with any faction. 
He added that he has met with Farid 'Abd-al-Hakim, whom he 
described as clear and well-motivated. He added that the 
important things in this dialogue are the bases, the subjects, 
and the goals. Dr. al-'Iryan pointed out that the Muslim 
Brotherhood has nothing to do with what happens in the meeting 
of the political bureaus of the Labor and Nasirite parties 
because the Labor Party has freedom of action. He noted that 
the alliance between the Labor Party and the Muslim Brotherhood 
still stands in specific areas, such as running for elections 
and coordination over general positions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Coptic Pope Shanudah by Sana' al-Sa'id in </F>
Cairo; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Sa'id] There has been a lot of talk in Cairo 
about an upcoming conference on minorities in the Middle East. 
This conference considers Egypt's Copts a religious minority. 
How do you feel about that? 
  [Shanudah] We are Egyptians and a part of the Egyptian 
people. We are not a minority in Egypt. We do not like to 
consider ourselves a minority and do not like others to call us 
a minority. The terms minority and majority indicate segregation 
and discrimination. This does not befit the sons of a single 
homeland, especially if this homeland is beloved Egypt. If the 
reason for the use of the terms minority and majority is the 
difference in religion, the tolerance of religion--any 
religion--does not permit this discrimination. We are all the 
descendants of one father, Adam, and one mother, Eve. 
  If the Copts have some problems or demands, these matters 
can 
be solved in a spirit of amity in the same homeland without the 
use of the terms minority and majority. These matters can be 
solved without psychological sensitivities. The attempts, even 
if they are well meaning, by some to defend the Copts does not 
necessarily require them to call us a minority. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Can it be said that under the new world order the 
attempts to stir up religions chauvinism and deepen the struggle 
among the parties have increased? Israel exploited this 
situation when it warned against the so-called Islamic 
fundamentalism in an attempt to win the sympathy of the West. 
  [Shanudah] I believe that states are motivated by interests 
and not religion. The proof is that during World War II the 
allies joined with communist Russia against Hitler. It was a 
temporary alliance. Each state is motivated by its interests 
and not by religion. If religion enters into the picture, it is 
marginal, not basic, and its use is temporary. For example, the 
United States now supports the Jews although it differs in 
religion with Israel. The whole issue is one of interests. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But Israel has always concentrated on using 
religion and on appearing as a religious state. 
  [Shanudah] In Israel proper religion is part of the state's 
mechanism. Israel is a state with a Jewish religious character. 
Jews did not cooperate with non-Jews in old times. The 
religious aspect is a basic one in Israel. Israel has both 
political and religious aims. 
  [Al-Sa'id] This illustrates Israel's racism and double 
standards in differentiating between its treatment of the Jewish 
settlers and the Palestinians. 
  [Shanudah] Naturally, Israel combines religion with racism. 
Israel's policy contains both elements. The Israelis call 
themselves "God's people." This expression is religious and has 
religious connotations. For example, the desire to rebuild the 
temple is a religious desire. In Israel both racism and 
religion are permanent fixtures. However, this does not apply 
to other states. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Sa'id] What is your opinion of U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's statement on Jerusalem as the united capital of Israel 
and that it is not part of the occupied Arab territories? 
  [Shanudah] Israel views Jerusalem as an essential issue. The 
United States should not have gone to this extent to appease 
Israel. It should not have made such a statement. The U.S. 
Administration retracted the statement later. It perhaps 
realized that it should not have gone this far, that it has hurt 
all the Arab countries, and that it has disregarded the feelings 
of the Muslims all over the world. For this reason, Clinton 
corrected the mistake and said that the issue of Jerusalem will 
be discussed in the political dialogue. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Sa'id] While Israel has been trying to deepen Jewish 
religious chauvinism, it has tried to accuse the neighboring 
countries of extremism and terrorism. Isn't this considered a 
kind of ideological conflict? 
  [Shanudah] Israel is the last country in the world that can 
accuse others of extremism and terrorism because the description 
applies to it. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident in Hebron is the 
best proof. Wasn't this an ugly terrorist operation? [passage 
omitted] Israel has no right to criticize or accuse others 
while it is involved in terrorism. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Regarding the existence of religious parties in 
Israel, there are some who think that the issue of whether we 
need religious parties or not should be raised in the national 
dialogue that is expected to be held this month. Some also 
think that a religious party, after it is established, cannot 
pull the carpet from under the religious extremists. 
  [Shanudah] Who said that the Israeli Government can coexist 
with the religious parties? 
  [Al-Sa'id] The parties constitute a pressuring factor and 
the government is afraid of them and seeks to win their support. 
  [Shanudah] The fact that the government seeks to win the 
support of the religious parties to ensure a majority in 
parliament does not mean that it welcomes them. On the 
contrary, if there were no religious parties the votes would go 
to the ruling party. We must not find controversial things in 
other states to emulate them. The existence of one religious 
party in Egypt will open the door to the formation of many other 
religious parties because there is no single religious ideology. 
As Christians we do not approve of this. There is no single 
religious ideology among the Muslims, and this could create 
conflicts. 
  [Al-Sa'id] This means that there is no reason to raise the 
issue of religious parties? 
  [Shanudah] In my opinion, if the Islamic trend is allowed to 
rule, more than one party will surface and these parties will be 
fighting each other. As it is now, there is a conflict among 
the various religious groups and each one labels the other 
atheist. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What about the Christians? 
  [Shanudah] We do not accept the establishment of religious 
parties. We do not accept the existence of a Christian 
religious party. It is not in our interest or in the interest 
of the state. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Sa'id] How can terrorism and violence be stopped? 
Shall a terrorist be regarded as a sick person who must be 
treated and reformed or a renegade who must be fought and 
eliminated? 
  [Shanudah] First of all, wide-scale enlightenment is an 
important matter. By enlightenment we mean answering the ideas 
used by terrorists to convince others to join them. Moderate 
thought and extremist thought must not run in two parallel lines 
that never meet. We must study their ideas and answer them. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Al-Sa'id] Can dialogue be held with blood-thirsty 
terrorists? 
  [Shanudah] If it is not possible to hold a dialogue with 
them, then we must hold dialogue with their ideas. We might not 
be able to hold a dialogue with a certain person because he 
might be in jail or in hiding. However, we can hold a dialogue 
with his ideas. This is one point. Another point is that we 
must eliminate those who support terrorism using their ideas, 
arms, and training. Some people encourage terrorism with their 
ideas, others with arms, and others by providing training. We 
must confront these three kinds of people who mostly come from 
abroad. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Sa'id] Can we depend on the security services alone? 
  [Shanudah] The security aspect alone is not enough. Emphasis 
on it may prolong the battle. An ideological and precautionary 
approach may preclude new conflicts between the security 
services and the terrorists. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Is it difficult for someone to argue with 
extremist thought and closed mentalities that stick to their 
ideas? 
  [Shanudah] It is not a difficult process. It is possible to 
get rid of old ideas by discussing new ones. It is possible for 
a person to believe in ideas, including religious ideas, 
different from his own ideas by discussing them with others. 
There are those who believe in certain ideas and then abandon 
them as a result of religious discussions. I discuss ideas and 
do not refer to persons. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Sa'id] In your opinion, what has caused this attack on 
religion? Who has encouraged attacks on religion at this 
particular time? 
  [Shanudah] Freedom of thought has been exploited beyond its 
boundaries. We are in an age in which freedom can be used 
incorrectly to attack old religious values. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Sa'id] Can the phenomenon of attacks on religion be a 
result of negligence by religious scholars? 
  [Shanudah] The phenomenon of attacks on religion is part of 
a general atmosphere. Just as there are attacks on religion, 
there are also attacks on law, politicians, family, and 
principles and ideals. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Column by Dr. Ibrahim Dasuqi Abazah] </F>
  [Excerpts] Who owns the radio and television in Egypt? Why 
does the government monopolize these media and prevent the 
opposition from using them? These media are the property of the 
Egyptian people. They established them and are paying for them. 
It is the right of all the political and social forces in the 
country to use these media to air their programs and expound 
their views without any discrimination. How can the government 
deprive the opposition of the right to use these media on the 
pretext that it possesses newspapers that express its views? 
  The opposition papers, no matter how great their 
capabilities 
may be, are only a small fraction of the government-owned press. 
If we add to this the fact that the government also owns seven 
radio stations and seven television channels that transmit day 
and night, we realize the enormous monopoly that the government 
has on the media and can discover easily the major things that 
are paralyzing political activity in Egypt and are weakening the 
parties' ability to appeal to the broad masses of the people. 
  It is not true that the parties in Egypt are weak. What is 
true is that the ruling regime does not want strong parties and 
that it is devoting all its efforts to prevent these parties 
from reaching the people. The regime achieves this through its 
control of the major information media and the minds of millions 
through beamed programs and distorted news. We do not need 
proof about the extent of the daily propaganda and money used by 
the government media. It is sufficient to note that the 
Information Ministry's budget is considered the largest in the 
Third World. No one has exceeded us in this area except the 
regime of Kim Il-song, who spends a quarter of North Korea's 
budget on propaganda for itself and the celebration of his 
birthday. 
  We are tired of repeating these facts. There is no other way 
but to find the means to enable the political forces to bring 
down this media wall and correct the defect that is affecting 
the freedom of expression and publication and shrinking the 
ability of the opposition to undertake effective political 
action. 
  The first solution is for the government to give up its 
monopoly on the media and allocate equal time for all the 
political parties to air their programs and views. This is a 
basic right demanded by democracy and repeatedly advocated by 
the parties, but to no avail. The second solution is for the 
government to allow the parties and the political forces to 
establish radio and television stations at their expense. 
[passage omitted] 
  If the government rejects the two solutions, the political 
opposition will have no alternative but to rent satellite 
television channels or transmission hours to air their programs, 
even if they have to transmit from outside the country. There 
are no technological barriers to prevent this. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, May 5 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has 
agreed to drop the title "president of Palestine" when he enters 
the self-rule regions of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
  According to a letter annexed to the Cairo accord on the 
launch of self-rule signed Wednesday, he will use the title 
"Chairman (Ra'is in Arabic) of the Palestinian Authority" to run 
Gaza and Jericho. 
  The Palestinians have referred to 'Arafat as president of 
Palestine since a session of their parliament-in-exile in 
Algiers in 1988. 
  But the letter, a copy of which AFP received here on 
Thursday 
[5 May], allows the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman 
to use the Arabic title "Ra'is" which also means president. 
  Also in the letter from Arafat addressed to Israel's Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, a co-signatory of the accord, the PLO 
agrees to inform the Israeli government of the names of the

  In Israel, the head of the government press office Uri Dromi

  [Text] Cairo, 6 May (MENA)-- Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has affirmed that if it were not for President Mubarak's 
wisdom, endurance, and patience the agreement to implement the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles would not have 
been reached. 
  In an interview with AL-JUMHURIYAH published today, 'Arafat 
says that President Mubarak made phenomenal efforts to 
accomplish this and that he has always been the best support, 
authority, and honest adviser to the Palestinians. 
  'Arafat affirmed that the Palestinians are fully prepared to 
enter Gaza and Jericho, pointing out that he will enter Jericho 
in May to do his job as chairman of the Palestinian National 
Authority. 
  President Mubarak has been our refuge whenever we 
encountered 
obstacles. If it were not for his endurance, his good 
experience with the Israelis, and his firmness we would not have 
been able to restore the lands, 'Arafat said. 
  Asked why he refused to sign the maps at first, 'Arafat said 
that he trusted that the Palestinians would be bound by what 
they signed and that the same would apply to Israel. The text 
was inconsistent with the maps; they brought the blue file with 
the amended text and annexed to it the old maps with the Israeli 
viewpoint, he said. But after negotiations and with President 
Mubarak's mediation, I agreed to sign. But I noted in my 
handwriting that: "Jericho's borders and area and the Gaza coast 
are under consideration." 
  'Arafat said: I trust that President Mubarak will back our 
serious efforts to implement what we have achieved and to settle 
later on the problem of inconsistencies between the maps and the 
text. 
  Asked about the first decision he had made after signing the 
agreement, 'Arafat said: In my capacity as chairman of the 
Palestinian National Authority, I issued general instructions to 
all Palestinian self-government authorities and other organs to 
respect the rights of Palestinians wherever they might be and 
regardless of political orientation. 
  Commenting on reports that the Palestinians are not prepared 
to enter Gaza and Jericho in implementation of the agreement, 
the Palestinian president said: We are fully prepared. He 
affirmed that he will enter Jericho during May and that he will 
do his job as chairman of the Palestinian National Authority 
from his headquarters in Jericho. 
  'Arafat affirmed that every Palestinian citizen is entitled 
to enter Gaza and Jericho. We will prevent no one from entering 
and we will coordinate with the Israeli side in this connection, 
he said. 
  The Palestinian president revealed that a large number of 
Arab and foreign states, as well as the United Nations and all 
its affiliated organizations have made requests to establish 
accredited representation offices in Jericho. He added that the 
European Union, the Islamic Conference Organization, and the 
Arab League have also requested permission to open 
representation offices. He welcomed all these organizations to 
Palestinian national soil. 
  Touching on international assistance to the National 
Authority, 'Arafat said that the World Bank has decided to grant 
the Palestinians $2.2 billions to assist them in development 
efforts and in arranging their household from within. 
  On the area of Jericho, 'Arafat said: We have reached a 
compromise solution on the area of Jericho. As for the Gaza 
coast, it will all be under the Palestinian National Authority. 
We agreed to give the Israeli side an opportunity to exploit 
some 7 kilometers for oil-related and other services. The 
Palestinian navy will begin operating along the coast, where we 
will have two ports along Gaza's Mediterranean coastal stretch. 
  Asked about the absence of any reference to a Palestinian 
state in the agreement, and about the absence of any such 
reference in Israeli officials' statements, 'Arafat said: In 
spite of this, there will be Palestinian autonomy on our 
national soil. No people in history who obtained the right to 
rule themselves did not eventually establish a state.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--In a statement here today, Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, stressed the importance of implementing the Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on time and as stipulated in 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  Commenting on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remark 
yesterday that 'Arafat has asked for a period of four weeks 
until the withdrawal and the deployment of the Palestinian 
police force take place, Sha'th said that President 'Arafat 
asked Rabin for the withdrawal to first be effected on time in 
accordance with the Gaza-Jericho agreement and according to the 
designated timetable to avoid any gap in time between the 
Israeli withdrawal and the entry of the Palestinian police force. 
  In his statement, Dr. Sha'th said that the period requested 
by 'Arafat is the same period specified in the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement. He said there are rumors that the withdrawal might be 
implemented within a day or two from the signing of the 
agreement. But 'Arafat asked that the withdrawal be effected 
according to the specified timetable so that they would be no 
time gap between the withdrawal and the entry of the Palestinian 
police force. 
  Dr. Sha'th's remarks were made during a news conference held 
by representatives of countries giving donations to the 
Palestinian police force following their meeting in Cairo today. 
  To a question about the funds to be given to the Palestinian 
police force in the self-rule regions by the donor countries, 
the Palestinian president's adviser said these funds will come 
from the European countries through a coordination institution. 
All these funds will be deposited in a private account in 
support of the Palestinian police, Dr. Sha'th added. He 
affirmed that there will be no custodianship on such funds. 
  Continuing, Dr. Sha'th noted that the PLO will be in 
complete 
control of these funds, adding that the PLO undertook to present 
clear accounts to the donor countries through an international 
institution in Cairo which will audit the accounts according to 
the international regulations. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that Saudi Arabia has indeed declared that 
it 
will pay US$20 million through the United Nations Relief and 
Works Agency [UNRWA] for economic development projects in Gaza 
and Jericho. Saudi aircraft will transport the Palestinian 
police force from six Arab countries to Gaza and Jericho, he 
added. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that the PLO will submit a list to Israeli 
Prime Minister Rabin containing the names of officials who will 
be in charge of various administrations in Gaza and Jericho in 
accordance with the agreement, which also notes that the names 
should be submitted a week after the signing of the agreement 
yesterday. 
  Dr. Sha'th pointed out that there are 6,000 Palestinian 
employees currently working in the civil administration 
[al-idarah al-madaniyah] in the Gaza Strip and these will become 
part of the self-administration [idarat al-hukm al-dhati]. 
Therefore, the self-administration will not start from a vacuum. 
  The Palestinian president's adviser said that negotiations 
will be held in Cairo within a week over certain points which 
were not resolved during the 'Arafat-Rabin meeting. He said 
that a round of negotiations will also be held for the election 
of the Palestinian National Authority. 
  As regards the negotiations over the transition period, Dr. 
Sha'th said these are slated to be held in Washington. However, 
he said that if the Arab-Israeli bilateral talks are not resumed 
in Washington soon, then the negotiations for the transition 
period will be held in Cairo. 
  Dr. Sha'th noted that the first 
Egyptian-Palestinian-Jordanian-Israeli meeting will be held 
within a month to discuss the return of refugees to Gaza and 
Jericho according to the agreement. 
  Terry Larsen, Norwegian deputy foreign minister and 
chairman of the donor countries coordination committee, said 
that the United States, Japan, and the EU have donated $20 
million to cover the expenses of the Palestinian police for six 
months and that Saudi Arabia has promised to provide the 
Palestinian police with electronic equipment worth $1 million. 
  He said that a number of Palestinian detainees will be freed 
from Israeli prisons today and more will be released next week. 
  Larsen said at the start of the conference that today's 
meeting discussed what has been achieved and the outcome of the 
tours made by delegations from the committee member countries to 
a number of donor countries last month. He added that a large 
number of countries have decided to extend financial support to 
the Palestinian police to help it carry out its duties. 
  Edmond Hal, U.S. charge d'affaires in Cairo and his 
country's 
representative on the committee, said that the United States 
believes that the Palestinian police force will be an element of 
support in the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. He 
called on all the donor countries to honor their pledges so that 
the Palestinian police can preform their duties. 
  The Russian Federation representative said that the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreements is the important 
thing now so that it will have a practical and positive effect 
on the entire peace process. He added that one of the 
coordination committee's objectives is to help the Palestinian 
police perform their duties and control the situation in Gaza 
and Jericho, stressing that his country is ready to help these 
forces. 
  On his part, Egypt's representative, Ambassador Husayn 
Darar, 
said that Egypt helped prepare the Palestinian police while 
participating in the negotiations process so that these forces 
would be ready to enter the self-rule area. He expressed 
pleasure at hosting the committee's work in Cairo, stressing 
that Egypt provided all the facilities for ensuring the success 
of its work. 
  It is recalled that Norway, the United States and Russia -- 
the co-sponsors of the peace conference -- and Egypt chair the 
committee coordinating international aid to the Palestinian 
police. The committee also includes Japan, the EU countries, 
and a number of financial insitutions.

<F P=106> [Report by Barry Parker] </F>
  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, 5 May 
(AFP)--Palestinian officials admitted Thursday [5 May] they were 
having "difficulties" launching self-rule, but fended off 
Israelis accusations off being ill-prepared. 
  PLO spokesman Sufyan Abu-Zayda told AFP there were 
"technical" problems, a day after the signing of an agreement to 
launch autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. 
  "We are not a government, we are an organization with our 
forces spread around the world," he told AFP. 
  "We have to expect that there will be difficulties, serious 
difficulties because this conflict has been going on for so many 
years," said PLO official Rashid Abu-Shibak, founder of the 
armed group the Black Panthers. 
  West Bank military administration spokeswoman Colonel Elise 
Shazar said the occupiers were "ready to transfer power at any 
time. 
  "But we are waiting for the Palestinians to knock on the 
door 
and present the list of names of the future heads for various 
sectors," she said. 
  "Since the Palestinians have asked for a delay to get 
organized, the administration is waiting and continues, while 
waiting, to be responsible for everything as usual." 
  The military administration would operate until the 
withdrawal was completed. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has already turned on the PLO 
for its apparent lack of readiness in a devastating outburst. 
  "They're not ready to take things over," he said Wednesday 
after PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat at first refused to initial part 
of the autonomy deal, causing chaos at the lavish ceremony. 
  'Arafat finally appended his reservations to the size of the 
Jericho enclave. 
  "We could finish our withdrawal in 10 days, the problem is 
that Yasir 'Arafat has asked for four weeks," Rabin revealed. 
  Palestinian negotiators were "more concerned about symbolic 
issues than purely practical problems". 
  Rabin urged the PLO to focus on the "economic woes" of Gaza. 
With more than half the working population unemployed and with 
little prospect of finding a job in the near future, the size of 
the task cannot be under-estimated. 
  The PLO, whose offices have just one telephone line working 
in Gaza City, had announced that 1,000 policemen would enter 
Gaza on Thursday. 
  But the arrival has now been put back to an imprecise 
"middle 
of next week". 
  From Cairo, PLO security chief Jibril Rajub told Israel 
radio: "There are logistical problems in the deployment of the 
Palestinian police. It will begin in a few days and will no 
doubt extend over a few weeks." 
  "We have to coordinate our efforts with Israel and a liaison 
committee will try to harmonize the deployment and the transfer 
of responsibilities." 
  The liaison committee met on the strip on Thursday with the 
aim of agreeing a timetable for the security transfer. 
  Israel has set a "representation" at the Erez crossing point 
into the strip to assist the new authorities and later to act as 
a contact point, for example if a Palestinian wants hospital 
treatment in Tel Aviv. 
  PLO spokesman Abu-Zayda tried to explain the slow pace. 
  "We don't want the police to come before everything is ready 
for their deployment. We don't want to put them in camps like 
jails," he said. 
  "We need a week to prepare things, to find places for them 
to 
live. The agreement gives us three weeks." 
  However, divisions among the Palestinian ranks cannot have 
helped. 
  No Palestinian figure from the territories attended the 
Cairo 
ceremony. 
  Neither West Bank Fatah chief Faysal al-Husayni, nor ex-PLO 
spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi, nor ex-head of the delegation to 
bilateral negotiations Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi. 
  "After a 27-year pregnancy, we have given birth to a 
premature son, in weak health and who may not survive," said 
al-Husayni. 
  Such prognostics were not heard publicly on the Gaza Strip 
among those charged with running autonomy. 
  "We are ready to set up the authority in 24 hours," claimed 
Abu-Shibak, who returned to Gaza in early April after escaping 
abroad to avoid arrest in 1990. 
  No one mentioned whether 'Arafat was using time as a weapon 
to try to gain more concessions from Israel over the size of 
Jericho and the release of prisoners, hundreds more of whom were 
expected to be freed Thursday after an initial 250 following the 
signing. 
  Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director of the PLO-appointed 
Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Construction, 
described the problems as "Palestinian insufficiency". 
  "We are not ready to receive authority," he said, pointing 
out that under occupation Palestinians had never had to take 
decisions. 
  "Environment questions, for example, are totally new to us," 
said Abu-Libdah who is also in charge of 36 technical committees 
the Palestinians set up after the Madrid conference launched the 
peace process in October 1991. 
  "What we need is to Palestinize the programmes in every 
sphere. It's not a matter of being a week late, it might take 
three or six months before we are really ready," he said 
  Palestinian sources added: "They are only ready in the field 
of health. 
  "It's the only field we have experience in and have a full 
programme ready. 
  "As for the rest, education, tourism or whatever nothing 
else 
is completed. 
  "For direct taxation nothing has been done. We need three 
months' work with the Israelis on tax matters. 
  "Autonomy grants authority to the Palestinians for indirect 
tax, social welfare, education, health and tourism."

    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television 
Network in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 5 May carries a 5-minute video 
report by military affairs correspondent Roni Daniyel which 
recounts that "the entrance of the Palestinian policemen to Gaza 
and Jericho will be delayed and will be carried out in stages." 
The report states that "the weapons of the Palestinian 
policemen will arrive in Egyptian Rafah in approximately three 
days. Later, after proper coordination with the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces], the policemen will enter Rafah and assume 
immediate responsibility over the area. The entrance of the 
Palestinian policemen to the other parts of the Strip has been 
delayed to a later date." The report notes that these details 
were concluded in a working meeting today between heads of the 
Israel-Palestinian liaison committee. 
  Daniyel explains that the first meeting of this committee 
was 
held at an IDF base near the Erez checkpoint today. He adds: 
"The initial stage of the Palestinian force's entrance started 
today in the shape of a familiarization tour of the five police 
installations in the Gaza Strip." Daniyel points out that the 
Palestinians "did not assume any responsibilities today, rather 
only reviewed the situation." Describing "the agreed-upon 
withdrawal method," Daniyel notes: "Unarmed Palestinian forces 
will enter the area while the IDF withdraws. Only then will the 
armed Palestinian policemen arrive with their vehicles and 
assume responsibility. The phased withdrawal from Rafah will 
start next Wednesday [11 May]." 
  Daniyel points out that the Palestinians will be the ones 
who 
decide how the withdrawal process proceeds, "on the basis of 
their ability to assume responsibility." "They will announce 
next week what size they can control. As things look now, they 
will start with the Rafah area." "The IDF is ready to evacuate 
all the areas over which the Palestinians will be ready to 
assume control." Daniyel stresses that both sides are striving 
to prevent a situation of a vacuum on the ground, "in which 
incidents can occur which both sides are not interested in." 
"For this reason the two sides are coordinating an overlapping 
process, wherein the Palestinians enter the area unarmed, study 
the area, and take over only after they are able to assume 
responsibility and rule. The IDF will evacuate the area 
immediately after it receives the appropriate order." 
  The report goes on to quote correspondent Yoram Binur, who 
says that "in Jericho too it is not known exactly when the 
Palestinian policemen will arrive. It is assessed they will 
cross the bridges from Jordan in the middle of next week. 
Meanwhile a preliminary Palestinian police team is in Jericho, 
coordinating the process with the IDF."

  [Excerpt] In Gaza, talks have been continuing between the 
Israelis and the Palestinians on the transfer of authority and 
facilities. In the Strip, as this was happening, was reporter 
Alan Ben-'Ami, who is on the line. What is the situation as of 
this moment, just over one day after the accord was signed? 
  [Ben-'Ami] You could say that today, for the first time, 
some real concrete steps towards having the Palestinians take 
control on the ground in the Gaza Strip and have the Israelis 
pull out, concrete steps began today. Basically, there was a 
meeting with the Palestinian police liaison team -- some senior 
Palestinian officers headed by General Ghazi Jabali and Major 
Ziyad 'Arif. They have been meeting with the top rank of the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] in Gaza and the Civil Administration 
people, like Brigadier General Yomtov Sami', the former 
commander of the Gaza Strip, who is now in charge of liaison 
between Israel and the Palestinians from the Israeli side; and 
Brig. Gen. Doron Almog, the current commander of the Gaza Strip. 
  They have had more than five hours of discussions. After 
that, the Palestinian liaison team of about 17 men split up, 
going off to look at police stations and various security 
facilities throughout the Gaza Strip, either with Israeli 
policemen or with IDF officers. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal -- live] </F>
  [Excerpt] Jerusalem sources have said that negotiations 
with the PLO on the completion of the Gaza and Jericho agreement 
will resume only after the PLO enters the self-government areas. 
Foreign Ministry sources believe that the negotiations will 
resume in Cairo, and will be held on the level they were held so 
far -- delegations under Major General Amnon Shahaq and Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th. 
  Speaking in Cairo, Sha'th announced that negotiations on the 
return of tens of thousands of misplaced Palestinians from 1967 
will begin next month. Jerusalem confirmed that the 
negotiations will be held according to the Oslo agreement in a 
four-way committee of representatives from Israel, the PLO, 
Egypt, and Jordan. According to Sha'th, Jordan has agreed to 
participate in the talks at the beginning of next month. 
  Foreign Ministry sources said that they do not know that a 
date has been set for the convention of the committee, but they 
said that Israel has agreed in principle that the committee 
convene in some two months. [passage omitted] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 6 May adds: 
"Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan says that there never were 
200,000 Palestinian refugees of the Six-Days War. There were 
only several dozen thousands [as heard], mostly from three 
villages from the Latrun region." Eytan further says that "the 
public is being misled, and that through these refugees, the 
government wants to grant the Palestinians the right of return 
it had canceled in the past. 
  ["The Likud says that the government no longer serves Jewish 
and Zionists interests, as seen in its readiness to implement 
the Palestinian right of return. The Likud spokesman has said 
that returning hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees 
into the boundaries of Eretz Yisra'el will result in a 
demographic disaster for Israel."]

  [Text] Doha, 6 May (AFP)--Middle East disarmament talks 
ended in deadlock here Thursday [5 May] with Arab and Israeli 
delegates unable to agree on a statement of principles on arms 
control, conference sources said. 
  The delegates agreed to re-submit a draft statement of 
principles to their respective governments before returning to 
more talks, the date and venue of which have still to be fixed, 
according US representative Robert Einhorn. 
  The draft plan comprises both military and political 
chapters, the latter rejected by Saudi Arabia. 
  "We categorically reject the political section of the 
project, which is aimed at normalizing relations between Arab 
states and Israel," Prince Turki bin-Muhammad al-Sa'ud, head of 
the Saudi delegation, told AFP. 
  "Most Arab participants also rejected this part of the 
text," 
Prince Turki said. 
  David Irvi, leader of the Israeli negotiating team, stressed 
his government's commitment to the entire plan, including the 
political chapter. 
  "The political section (of the accord) is necessary because 
it offers a working framework for future meetings," he argued. 
  The draft statement drawn up at a meeting in Cairo in 
January 
proposed a number of confidence-bulding measures and the 
creation of a zone where weapons of mass destruction would be 
banned. 
  Prince Turki said the statement should cover "only military 
questions, including the elimination of weapons of mass 
destruction." 
  Ivri said he did not understand Saudi Arabia's objections. 
The kingdom had rejected a US proposal to hold another meeting 
in June in Vienna, judging that date too close, he added. 
  Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jabbir Al Thani sounded an 
optimistic note. "We hope to achieve better results in the 
future, making progress in line with the continuation in the 
peace process in the Middle East," he said. 
  The delegates approved in principle the creation of a crisis 
prevention centre in Qatar, as well as a telecommunications 
centre and a databank. 
  Switzerland and Finland offered to welcome delegates from 
the 
region for visits to arms control sites and military training in 
the two countries. 
  Israel also offered a similar visit to one of its military 
sites, but the suggestion was turned down by Saudi Arabia. 
  "We will not take part in any activities in Israel and we 
will not host any of the multilateral negotiations," declared 
Prince Turki. 
  The meeting here -- marking the first time Israeli officials 
had travelled to Qatar -- was part of a multilateral negotiating 
process on Middle Eastern regional issues that parallels 
bilateral Arab-Israeli talks on purely political disputes. 
  The talks were launched an international Middle East peace 
conference arranged in Madrid in October 1991 by the United 
States and the former Soviet Union. 
  Other multinational committees are focusing on economic 
issues, water sharing, the environment and refugees.

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, 8 May (KUNA) -- Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, 
Saudi foreign affairs minister, stressed that the only way to 
confront the dangers posed by the Iraqi regime to the whole 
region and to its people lies "in the complete and comprehensive 
implementation of the Security Council's resolutions" in 
connection with its invasion of the State of Kuwait. [passage 
omitted] 
  Prince Sa'ud was addressing the 5th meeting between the GCC 
[Gulf Cooperation Council] foreign affairs ministers and the EU 
counterparts, which opened today. 
  Karlos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister and head of the 
European side, also delivered a similar speech in which he dealt 
with the peace process in the Middle East, the situation in 
former Yugoslavia, and cooperation between the two sides in the 
economic sphere. 
  In his address, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal stressed the GCC 
states' eagerness to bolster security and stability in the Gulf 
region and guarantee the safety of navigation in their waters. 
He expressed hope that political statements by Iranian 
officials expressing wishes to develop Iran's relations with the 
GCC states, would be accompanied, on the ground, by policies 
compatible with those wishes. 
  Prince Sa'ud said he looked forward to a positive reply from 
the republic of Iran [as received] to the initiative made by the 
president of the United Arab Emirates in order to solve the 
dispute over the three islands [Abu Musa, Greater Tumb, and 
Lesser Tumb]. 
  In his address, Prince Sa'ud called upon the Yemeni 
leaderships to resort to self-restraint, stop the fighting, 
avoid bloodshed and pursue means of dialogue to solve their 
bloody conflict. 
  He also called for the use of the recent Israeli-Palestinian 
agreement to achieve a real progress in all other bilateral 
talks, particularly the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks. 
  He added that any fundamental progress in the bilateral 
talks 
would help achieve tangible progress in the multilateral talks; 
this will accordingly help achieve the set goal for the peace 
process: a just, comprehensive and permanent peace in the 
Middle East. 
  In his address, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal dwelt on the 
situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and called on the European Union, to which 
he attributed a particular responsibility due to its geographic 
location, to take necessary measures to guarantee the security 
and safety of all other areas following the example of Sarajevo. 
  Prince Sa'ud called on the United Nations to take all the 
measures to prevent rewarding the Serbs for their aggression and 
called for the need to lift the arms embargo on the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to allow it to exert it legitimate right to 
self-defense. 
  Regarding economic cooperation between the GCC and the EU, 
Prince Sau'd expressed hope that the recommendations submitted 
to the meeting by the joint cooperation committee, particularly 
the intertwined issues of energy and environment, would help 
drawing defined ideas to implement the contents of the joint 
report in the form of recommendations in order to achieve the 
goals included in the cooperation agreement concluded between 
the two sides in 1988. 
  [Passage omitted] On his part, the Greek foreign affairs 
minister, Karlos Papoulias, affirmed the EU's support for the 
implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement which was 
recently signed in Cairo. 
  [Passage omitted] Minister Papoulias expressed worry over 
the 
continuation of the Yugoslav crisis and renewed the community's 
commitment to exert more efforts for achieving just and 
permanent peace. 
  On the economic side, the Greek minister welcomed the 
agreement reached by the GCC finance ministers on unifying 
customs tariff among their countries, a matter which would 
facilitate the start of a joint trade agreement between the 
European Community and GCC countries. 
  He said that the recommendations of the team which is made 
up 
of representatives from the two sides on energy and 
environmental issues would help [the two sides] to overstep the 
differences in the points of view in these fields. 
  Papoulias asked the Gulf states for more commitment to 
protect the environment as a step towards participating in 
achieving an international strategy for this purpose. 
  Shaykh Fahim al-Qasimi, GCC secretary-general, delivered a 
speech in which he reviewed what the GCC has been achieved since 
the fourth meeting, pointing out that the Council has continued 
its march among the member countries in the political, economic, 
military, and security spheres rapidly and continuously. 
  He pointed out that the private sector's contribution in the 
economic sphere of the economies of the GCC countries has 
increased, and that the growth of the non-oil production sectors 
has continued. 
  He pointed out that the council has adopted a number of 
decisions, among which was the creation of a trade arbitration 
center for the Council's countries for settling trade and 
investment disputes and facilitating the movement and exchange 
of commodities and services. 
  He added that there were also directives to speed up the 
efforts aimed at reaching an agreement on the unified customs 
tariff. 
  In his turn, Shaykh Muhammad Bin Mubarak Al Khalifah, 
foreign 
affairs minister of the State of Bahrain, emphasized that the 
Gulf-European meeting convened in Riyad acquired extreme 
importance which reflected the nature of the period in which it 
was held and expressed its aims in developing and strengthening 
coordination and political and economic cooperation between the 
council's countries and the EU. 
  He said in a speech delivered at the economic discussions of 
the fifth joint meeting of the GCC and EU countries that the 
consecutive regional and international transformations and 
changes the world was witnessing called for the intensification 
of the dialogue and the exchange of opinions and expertise in 
order to deal with these changes and transformations which 
resulted from the ending of the cold war period, the 
comprehensive change in the map of international relations and 
the establishment of the new world order. 
  He referred to the negotiation rounds between the GCC and EU 
countries and said that despite the correspondences or 
differences in the points of view accompanying such rounds on a 
number of political and economic issues, the continued objective 
dialogue has achieved positive interconnection and widened the 
area of agreement for achieving a cooperative and coordinated 
platform. 
  He expressed the hope that this would in the end lead to an 
agreement for setting up the free trade zone between the two 
groups [GCC and EU] to safeguard their joint interests, 
particularly after some GCC countries have signed the GATT 
agreement.

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, May 8, SPA--The fifth session of the 
joint ministerial council of the Gulf Cooperation Council and 
the European Union (EU) started here on Sunday [8 May] under the 
co-chairmanship of Prince Al Sa'ud al-Faysal, the Saudi foreign 
minister and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, the head 
of the EU Ministerial Council. [passage omitted] 
  Prince Al Sa'ud told the participants that after three years 
of Kuwait's liberation, the Iraqi regime continues to delay 
implementation of basic elements of the Security Council 
resolutions pertaining to its aggression on Kuwait. And the 
Iraqi regime continues to deal selectively with its obligations 
towards the resolutions of the international legality which 
constitute a unified package. 
  "At a time when the Iraqi regime concentrates efforts to 
show 
some cooperation with the U.N. inspectors of weapons of the mass 
destruction in an attempt to give an impression of a limited 
kind of response to some demands of the Security Council 
resolutions as justification for lifting economic sanctions 
imposed on it, it is important to recall that the core of the 
conflict is the Iraqi regime's non-respect for the sovereignty 
and independence of Kuwait, which constitutes the core of the 
resolutions of the international legality. Moreover, the Iraqi 
regime continues to oppose Resolution 833 on the recognition of 
international borders' demarcation," Prince Al Sa'ud said. 
  Prince Al Sa'ud regretted that the Iraqi regime is still 
detaining the Kuwaiti prisoners of war and captives of other 
nationals and refraining from paying legal compensations for 
damages caused by its aggression. 
  "The only possible and open way to confront the dangers 
posed 
by this regime is to bring about full and comprehensive 
compliance of the resolutions of the Security Council," the 
Saudi foreign minister said. 
  Prince Al Sa'ud expressed deep anxiety over the sufferings 
of 
the brotherly Iraqi people triggered by the oppressive practices 
of the Iraqi regime and expressed full sympathy with them. 
  He demanded that the Iraqi regime should comply with the 
Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 dealing with the 
humanitarian, food and medicines needs of the Iraqi people and 
held the Iraqi regime fully responsible for the humanitarian 
plight sustained by the Iraqi people. 
  Concerning relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Prince Al Sa'ud made it clear that the GCC states have a keen 
interest to maintain peace and stability in the Gulf region and 
ensure guarantees of navigation in the Gulf. "We are always 
working for the realisation of cordial and constructive 
relations with Iran based on good neighbourly ties, mutual 
respect and non-intervention in the domestic affairs, respect 
for the sovereignty and independence of all states and their 
territorial integration. 
  "While, we hear of the statements of the Iranian officials 
on 
a similar desire for developing cordial relations with us, yet 
we hope that such statements would be accompanied with practical 
policies to harmonize such a desire into reality. And, in this 
context, we notice with grave deploration the continuation of 
the conflict between the United Arab Emirates [UAE] and Iran on 
the three Emirate islands. And it is hoped that the welfare 
initiative offered by the UAE's President Sheykh Zayid 
Bin-Sultan Al-Nuhayyan for settling the issue of the three 
islands through direct talks would be [word indistinct] to cut 
short his visit and return to the kingdom to remain under orders 
of custodian of the two holy mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al'Aziz 
and Crown Prince 'Abdallah Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, who are engaged in 
continuous contacts with their Arab colleagues to save Yemen 
from the crisis. 
  He called on the Yemeni brothers to come together and 
resolve 
their problems with amicable and peaceful means.

  [Text] Riyadh, 8 May (KUNA) -- The foreign ministers of the 
European Union [EU] and their GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] 
counterparts have renewed their emphasis that the complete and 
quick implementation by the Iraqi regime of all UN Security 
Council resolutions remains a precondition to the establishment 
of peace and stability in the Gulf region. 
  In a communique released at the end of their meetings here 
today, the ministers condemned the Iraqi regime for not fully 
implementing the Security Council's resolution, and for pursuing 
a selective policy in implementing those resolutions. 
  The ministers stressed the importance they attach to the 
full 
and unconditional abidance of the Iraqi regime by Resolution 
687, its immediate release of all Kuwaiti and other POWs and 
hostages from its prisons and detention camps, the dismantling 
of mass destruction weapons, and the payment of full 
compensation for the losses and damages caused by its aggression 
on the State of Kuwait. 
  The ministers renewed their support of the Security 
Council's 
Resolution 833 that stresses the inviolability of the 
international borders of the State of Kuwait and endorses the 
final report by the UN Commission on the demarcation of the 
international Iraqi-Kuwaiti boundaries. 
  The communique included an appeal to the parties in Yemen 
for 
self-restraint, halting the fighting, and to resort to reason 
and dialogue. 
  In their communique, the ministers stressed the importance 
of 
"the stability of international energy markets and the 
realization of equilibrium between supply and demand in the 
interest of the producers and consumers alike, and to facilitate 
investments in the field of energy." 
  In their statement, the ministers urged Iran to respond to 
an 
initiative by UAE President Shaykh Zayid Bin Sultan al-Nuhayyan 
to resolve the dispute peacefully through negotiations and in 
line with international law. 
  The communique welcomed the Gaza-Jericho agreement that was 
signed in Cairo last week and expressed full support for it to 
be implemented totally and urgently. They pointed out the 
importance they held in achieving fundamental and quick progress 
in the other tracks of the bilateral negotiations, particularly 
the Syrian track, in order to guarantee a just, lasting, and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The communique also 
expressed the GCC's intention to continue to play an active and 
constructive role in the multilateral talks that completed -- 
and did not replace -- the bilateral negotiations. 
  The ministers reiterated their views that fundamental 
progress in the bilateral tracks will contribute to the success 
of the multilateral talks and stressed the importance of 
providing all forms of help, including economic aid, to the 
occupied territories. 
  The communique outlined the European point of view that 
"lifting the Arab boycott of Israel will contribute toward 
strengthening the peace process" in the Middle East. 
  As for Bosnia, the ministers expressed their full support 
for 
efforts by the international community to reach a negotiable 
solution soon to the dispute in Bosnia. 
  They indicated that the main outlines for the European work 
plan that all parties endorsed at the time remained a strong 
basis for a solution. 
  The Council's foreign ministers expressed their view on the 
necessity to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina to 
enable it to practice its right to legitimate defense [words 
indistinct]. 
  On the economic side, the two sides did not arrive at a 
clear 
view regarding the carbon tax that the industrial countries want 
to impose on their imports of oil. However, they agreed to 
continue the constructive dialogue with the aim of reinforcing 
economic and commercial cooperation. 
  Sources at the meeting had noted earlier today that the 
morning session that dealt with economic topics "did not 
concentrate on the issue of carbon tax as expected." The 
sources said this was due to the lack of a unified European 
stance vis-a-vis the imposition of the carbon tax, in addition 
to the spirit of cooperation shown by the Gulf partners. 
  The communique stressed the need for a suitable policies to 
deal with issues of the environment, energy, and economic 
development due to the overlap between them. 
  The communique also stressed the two sides' resolve to 
complete the free trade negotiations as soon as possible by 
calling on the industrial, energy, and environmental cooperation 
working groups to meet with the aim of presenting fresh 
proposals for cooperation in those fields. 
  On the other hand, Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, 
the head of the European side in the meeting, and his Saudi 
counterpart, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, emphasized the success of 
the meeting and the agreement of the two sides within the 
framework of mutual cooperation. 
  In a joint news conference held at the conclusion of the 
fifth meeting, the two ministers noted that an extensive 
discussion was carried out regarding the situation in the Middle 
East and Europe, in addition to economic cooperation issues. 
  The Greek foreign minister stressed Europe's interest in 
ending the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a "European 
problem." He referred to the efforts of the European Union, in 
cooperation with the United States and Russia, in order to reach 
an immediate cease-fire in Bosnia, stressing that this was the 
basis for the settlement of the conflict. 
  Officials taking part on the European side stressed during 
the news conference that it was unlikely that the two sides will 
arrive at the present at an agreement pertaining to free trade 
due to the nonexistence of a unified customs tariff in the GCC 
countries, however, they welcomed the decision of the GCC 
finance ministers regarding the agreement on drawing up a 
program to unify the customs tariff in the GCC countries.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent in Qatar Karmela Menashe] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Saudi Arabia sent a more 
senior representative to the multilateral disarmament talks in 
Qatar than it had to previous encounters -- the king's cousin, 
Prince al-Turki. Saudi Arabia sought to prove that it was the 
true master of the Gulf region. 
  Throughout the discussions, the Saudi representative's stand 
was obvious: Progress in the multilateral talks and the 
practical implementation of confidence-building measures can 
take place only after the peace process makes further progress. 
[passage omitted] 
  Eytan Bentzur, a Foreign Ministry deputy director general 
and 
member of the Israeli delegation to the Qatar talks, says the 
Saudis encumbered the progress of the talks. They should 
realize better than anyone else that they have a vested interest 
in the peace process, and in deflating tensions in this 
sensitive and charged region, he said. [passage omitted] 
  Despite the Saudi attempt to place obstacles, resolutions 
were adopted. It is unclear whether the Gulf states were 
thereby disobeying Saudi Arabia, which tried to demonstrate that 
its own stands will prevail vis-a-vis the other members of the 
oil-producing countries alliance, or perhaps the Saudis were 
militant only in plenum sessions. 
  Outside the formal talks, the Israeli delegation held 
conversations and meetings with the Tunisian representative, who 
made attempts to soften the Saudis, with the representatives of 
Oman, Egypt, and the U.S., and with the Qatari foreign minister. 
  After the talks, Israeli delegates said this was another 
step 
toward normalization with the world. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--The Arab League Council's 
emergency session at the permanent delegate-level, called by 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa to find a quick solution to the 
military crisis in Yemen, opened at the Arab League General 
Secretariat today. 
  As Yemen is the current chairman of the Arab League, Yemeni 
Charge d'Affaires Ahmad Shahir Sayf opened the meeting by 
thanking Egypt for calling this meeting to stop the bloodshed in 
Yemen, halt the military operations, and invite the concerned 
parties to sit at the negotiating table instead of arguing with 
guns. 
  The Yemeni official said he finds it very difficult to 
continue chairing this meeting as a Yemeni citizen whose heart 
is bleeding because of the developments in Yemen. He announced 
that he had relinquished the chairmanship to another country. 
  After the Yemeni delegate's speech, Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid announced Ambassador Nayif 
Sa'ud al-Qadi, Jordan's permanent delegate to the Arab League, 
would chair the emergency meeting, being next alphabetically. 
  Opening the session, Ambassador Nayif al-Qadi said: I would 
like to express deep sorrow and pain at the situation in a 
country we love. He expressed his regret that the Yemeni 
leaders had abandoned dialogue and reason and resorted to guns. 
  He added: We do not take what is happening in fraternal 
Yemen lightly, because the developments will not be confined to 
Yemen and its people. Their repercussions will affect us all. 
No Arab country will be removed from what has happened and the 
bleeding wound will expand if we do not hasten to bind it. 
  Al-Qadi noted that Jordan was among the first parties to 
seek 
to mediate to help resolve the Yemeni crisis. He said, with 
help from the Omani brothers, his country managed to broker the 
Pledge and Accord Document which was signed in the Jordanian 
capital by Yemeni leaders in the presence of several Arab 
leaders. The Yemenis wanted this document as a means out of the 
crisis. 
  He added that mediation did not cease after the signing of 
this agreement, and noted the efforts of Egypt, the United Arab 
Emirates, and the Arab League, which all sought to provide 
controls to prevent military friction and avert what we had 
expected and feared. 
  He called on the Arab League Council to work in its 
emergency 
session to adopt a practical and objective stand that would help 
stop the bloody fighting in Yemen and preserve the fraternal 
Yemeni people's interests. 
  Concluding his speech, the Jordanian delegate thanked Egypt 
for calling this emergency meeting out of concern for the Yemeni 
people's interests. 
  After his speech, the Arab League Council held a closed 
session to discuss an Egyptian proposal to send Arab forces to 
maintain peace in Yemen and to carry out measures guaranteeing 
an end to the fighting.

  [Text] Cairo, May 7 (AFP) -- The Arab League decided here 
Saturday [7 May] not to intervene in Yemen's civil war after the 
northern-led government turned down an Egyptian proposal to send 
Arab peacekeepers to halt its conflict with the south. 
  But permanent delegates at the Cairo-based organisation 
called on its secretary general, 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, to pursue 
efforts to end the conflict which erupted on Thursday. 
  A diplomatic source said the League decided to abstain on 
the 
Egyptian proposal after it had been turned down by the north. 
  Senior southern leader 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Dali had said earlier 
the south could favour Egyptian proposals to send a peacekeeping 
force. 
  He said the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) led by 
Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid "supported all measures by the 
Arab League," after meeting with 'Abd-al-Majid. 
  And he added that if the "situation is necessary and if it 
is 
imperative in order to stop the fighting" then the YSP was in 
favour of sending a peacekeeping force "even if northern leaders 
reject it." 
  Foreign Minister Muhammad Salih Basindwa earlier opposed the 
emergency meeting in Cairo, insisting the three days of intense 
fighting in Yemen was an "internal affair." 
  'Abd-al-Majid told journalists after the meeting behind 
closed doors that the Arab countries had charged him with 
"continuing efforts to stop the fighting immediately." 
  They also repeated their support for Yemen, where fighting 
erupted Thursday between rival forces from the former North and 
South Yemen which were unified in May 1990. 
  The proposal put forward by Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa needed the backing of both the Arab League and Yemen.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--The Arab League Council held an 
emergency session in Cairo today. It called on Yemeni leaders 
to work harder to resolve their differences and cement Yemeni 
unity, pointing out that Yemen's unity is linked to the region's 
stability and security. This was declared by Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid at a news conference 
following the end of the session. 
  Yemen's unity is a "pan-Arab achievement and asset" that 
must 
be protected and maintained, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said. The 
secretary general said that the Arab League Council instructed 
him to get in touch with Yemeni leaders to seek an immediate end 
to the fighting and to keep the League's member states informed 
about his efforts. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Council will consider itself 
in a state of permanent session to follow up the efforts that 
various Arab leaders are exerting to end the Yemeni crisis. 
  Answering journalists' questions, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said 
that 
the dispatch of Arab troops to separate rival forces in Yemen 
"was not discussed" in today's session. 
  Asked to comment on the news that Yemen is not enthusiastic 
about the holding of this particular meeting of the Arab League 
Council, the secretary general said that any two League member 
states have the right to request a Council meeting. Today's 
session was at the request of Egypt and Libya, he stated. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Arab League Council does not 
interfere in the internal affairs of Yemen or any Arab country. 
The Council respects the sovereignty of all Arab countries, he 
added. 
  The secretary general pointed out that the Yemeni leadership 
received an Arab League delegation on 4 March. Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid pointed out that the other Arab leaders attended 
the signing of the Pledge and Accord document in Amman, on 20 
February, a matter which, the secretary general added, confirms 
Arab interest in the situation in Yemen.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)-- Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
al-Dali, member of the Political Bureau of the Yemen Socialist 
Party [YSP] and personal envoy of Yemeni Vice President [title 
as received] 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  Following the meeting, al-Dali stated that the urgent 
meeting 
of the Arab League Council is a positive step toward solving the 
Yemeni crisis. He said he hopes the meeting will stop the 
bloody war between northern and southern Yemeni troops in good 
time. 
  He added that the YSP supports any step the brothers at the 
Arab League take and the Egyptian initiative on Yemen. 
  Al-Dali said the current infighting in Yemen is not a 
domestic but rather a pan-Arab affair, adding that the YSP will 
demand Arab assistance if the Yemeni parties fail to stop the 
fighting. 
  Touching on the Egyptian proposal to send Arab peace-keeping 
forces to Yemen, al-Dali remarked that the YSP will welcome this 
if it becomes necessary, even if Yemeni leaders refuse to stop 
fighting. 
  He appealed to all Yemeni leaders and brothers in Egypt and 
other Arab states to take action to end the ongoing fighting in 
Yemen.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Nabi 'Abd-al-Sattar] </F>
  [Excerpts] The general commissioner of the Damascus main 
branch of the Arab Bureau on the Boycott of Israel is making 
contacts with Arab governments to set a date for the bureau's 
67th session, which has been postponed since October 1993. 
  Arab diplomatic sources in Cairo affirm that Syria is 
currently leading a large-scale diplomatic effort to persuade 
Arab states to hold on to the boycott weapon until all occupied 
Arab territories are liberated. The sources revealed that seven 
Arab states in Asia and Africa have ended their second- and 
third-level economic boycotts of Israel. 
  At its last meeting in late March, the Arab League 
Ministerial Council reiterated the Arab states' firm concurence 
with the provisions of the boycott and their resistance to 
foreign legislation opposing the boycott. The reason the 
council gave was the continued Israeli occupation of Palestine, 
the Golan Heights, and South Lebanon. 
  The United States and other Western states have recently 
sought to persuade Arab states to shrink their boycott of Israel 
gradually and eventually end it. [passage omitted] 
  The latest report the Boycott Bureau issued includes a list 
of 60 companies, firms, and foreign banks that have violated the 
terms of the boycott. The bureau called for including these on 
the black list. The companies are British, American, Spanish, 
and Bulgarian. 
  The bureau recommended that the ban be lifted on certain 
Dutch, British, Swedish, Australian, American, Swiss, Greek, 
French, Canadian, Singaporean, and Danish firms. These firms 
submitted documents proving the integrity of their position. 
  The report demanded the addition of 6 ships belonging to 
Panama, the Bahamas, Honduras, and Malaysia to the black list.

<F P=106> [By Barry Parker] </F>
  [Text] Jerusalem, May 8 (AFP) -- The on-off arrival of the 
first contingent of armed Palestinian policemen to the occupied 
territories was delayed again on Sunday [8 May], Israeli 
officials said. 
  A battalion of 270 men carrying M-16 rifles reached the 
Allenby Bridge crossing from Jordan to the West Bank, but Israel 
said they would not be allowed in until Monday. 
  An AFP correspondent reported that the men, members of the 
PLO's Palestine Liberation Army, had gathered a kilometre 
(around half a mile) from the bridge. 
  The Palestinian representative in Jordan, al-Tayyib 
'Abd-al-Rahim, had said the contingent could set off shortly 
after formalities were completed. Another 300-strong contingent 
was then due to cross Monday after arriving from Iraq. 
  However Israel's military administration for the West Bank 
denied that the police would cross the Allenby Bridge to the 
newly-autonomy Jericho enclave on Sunday. 
  "Nothing will happen today," an administration spokesman 
said. "It should be tomorrow, Monday." 
  The Israeli news agency ITIM reported that the arrivals had 
not been coordinated with the Israelis over Friday-Saturday and 
would therefore be delayed. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's spokesman Gad Ben-Ari said: 
"We are sorry for the delays, which the Palestinians say are due 
to technical reasons, we hope they will arrive as soon as 
possible." 
  On the Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources said the police 
deployment there had been postponed again after being scheduled 
for Sunday. 
  Several hundred policemen were at first scheduled to cross 
the Rafah border from Egypt last Thursday. That was delayed 
until Sunday, then put back further until the middle of the 
following week, before being brought back to Sunday again. 
  The Palestinian sources blamed "technical reasons" for the 
latest hold-up in the arrival of some 300 policemen from Egypt. 
  No new date has been given for the arrivals to Gaza. 
  Nineteen senior Palestinian officers, including several 
"generals" did arrive in Gaza last Wednesday ready to take 
charge from the withdrawing Israelis. 
  They have formed a liaison committee and toured Israeli army 
and police buildings which the Palestinians are to take over. 
  The bulk of the 9,000-strong Palestinian police has been 
recruited from the PLA [Palestine Liberation Army], which is the 
PLO's army and has brigades scattered across several Arab 
countries. 
  The policemen are to take over security from the Israeli 
army 
in the Gaza Strip and Jericho under the autonomy deal Israel and 
the PLO signed last Wednesday. 
  The autonomy agreement gives Israel the right to approve all 
the names of the police and details their arms and equipment. 
  They can carry 7,000 personal arms, 120 machineguns of 0.3 
mm 
and 0.5 mm calibre and drive 45 armoured vehicles, the accord 
says. 
  The armoured vehicles will need prior Israeli approval to 
use 
the main north-south road on the Gaza Strip. 
  Any equipment, weapons and munitions donated or bought from 
abroad is subject to Israeli approval. 
  The police are to maintain order in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho while Israel remains responsible for the protection of 
settlers and borders.

  [Text] Rafah, 8 May (MENA)--Major General Nasr Yusuf, 
director general of the Palestinian security force, has stated 
that the Palestinian 'Ayn Jalut Forces will take over the 
security tasks in the Palestinian city of Rafah and that the 
Badr forces arriving from Jordan will take over the security 
tasks in Jericho. He said that deployment of these 9,000 
personnel is scheduled to be completed by 25 May, the date set 
for the end of the Israeli withdrawal and handing over the 
security and civilian powers to the Palestinians in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf praised Egypt's preparation and training of 
the 'Ayn Jalut Forces, which have been deployed in Egypt since 
the 1960's, to work as infantry personnel and to perform 
security tasks after the signing of the latest agreement. He 
noted that there are Palestinian security personnel receiving 
training on police and security tasks. He said that the first 
group of these personnel will complete their training courses in 
July. He praised the facilities that the Central Security 
Forces in Sinia provided for the Palestinian forces on arrival 
in Rahah before entering the Gaza Strip. 
  Marwan Kanafani, adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat expressed the Palestinian people's appreciation for the 
training Egypt, led by President 'Arafat, has offered and is 
offering to enable the Palestinian security and political 
departments to take over their tasks. He noted that President 
Mubarak affirmed to 'Arafat Egypt's readiness to support the 
Palestinian people in rebuilding the infrastructure which was 
destroyed by the occupation forces. 
  Maj. Gen. Muhammad al-Nashshar, commander of the Central 
Security Forces in Sinai, visited the camp where the Palestinian 
security forces were received in Rafah and met with Maj. Gen. 
Nasr Yusuf and Marwan Kanafani. He made a speech in which he 
congratulated the Palestinians on taking power in Gaza and 
Jericho and expressed his hope that they would take power in the 
entire West Bank shortly. Maj. Gen. Yusuf expressed the 
Palestinian forces' thanks for their brothers in Egypt and 
stressed that Egypt has never abandoned its obligations toward 
Palestine and its people.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Details on the situation in 
the occupied Gaza Strip and Jericho and the reactions to the 
agreement on implementing Palestinian self-rule are in the 
following report from our correspondent in the occupied 
Palestinian territories: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Passage omitted] On the 
reasons 
behind the Palestinian request to delay assuming authority from 
the Israeli side, I met Dr. Samir 'Abdullah, member of the 
negotiating team, whose name appeared on the list of the 
upcoming national authority. He said: 
  [Begin recording] ['Abdullah] It is obvious that there is a 
weakness in the Palestinian preparedness. Preparations for this 
day were not made in a correct manner, and this has led to the 
delay. 
  [Correspondent] This request for the delay was the subject 
of 
criticism by the Israelis and probably by some international 
sides. This is attributed to the inability of the Palestinians 
to assume the responsibilities for which they have been calling 
for a long time. 
  ['Abdullah] In my view, the criticism is clear. There is 
bitter criticism in the Palestinian camp. The Palestinian camp 
and people were waiting for the moment of withdrawal of the 
Israelis from the occupied territories, but it seems that the 
leadership in Tunis has not prepared itself properly for this 
moment, though it was expected that the Palestinians would 
assume authority quickly. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Muhammad Kurayshan report from Tunis] </F>
  [Text] The PLO Executive Committee is expected to resume 
meetings in Tunis tomorrow. The Executive committee began its 
meetings today under Yasir 'Arafat and in the presence of nine 
of its members. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and Bishop Iliya Khuri will 
join them tomorrow. 
  Immediately after his return from Amman, 'Arafat submitted a 
report on the atmosphere that prevailed over the signing of the 
Cairo agreement on 4 May, particularly on the points of 
differences that are still pending with the Israelis. 'Arafat 
said these differences will be discussed within the next three 
months. 
  According to informed sources here, 'Arafat denied at the 
meeting that he had asked Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
to postpone the transfer of power in Gaza and Jericho until the 
Palestinian side finds itself ready to do so. 
  The PLO Executive Committee discussed the configuration of 
the Palestinian authority that will take charge of the autonomy 
rule, which is expected to be equally divided between the 
Palestinians inside and outside the [territories] under Yasir 
'Arafat. 
  The formation of this authority is expected to be announced 
here in Tunis in the next two days, at the end of the current 
meetings. It seems that there is no dispute about the figures 
from the territories, while viewpoints continue to be exchanged 
concerning the figures from the diaspora [word indistinct] from 
the PLO Executive Committee and Fatah Central Committee. 
  Ahmad Quray', Abu-'Ala', head of the PLO Economic 
Department, will leave for Amman soon to inform the Jordanian 
Government about the details of the economic agreement with 
Israel and the scope of Jordanian-Palestinian coordination in 
this field.

  [Text] In connection with the Middle East, President Yasir 
'Arafat continues his consultations to complete the names of the 
team of his government, which will assume power in the occupied 
territories during the transitional period. 
  The establishment of Palestinian authority comes in 
implementation of the self-rule agreement in Gaza and Jericho, 
which was signed on Wednesday last [4 May]. 
  In fact, the Palestinian president is today expected to 
continue his consultations, which are mainly concentrated on the 
list of names from inside the occupied territories who will 
occupy 12 specific posts in the autonomous Palestinian 
government. 
  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat held a meeting in Tunis 
last night with members of the Fatah Central Committee, the 
largest of the PLO, to discuss preparations for the handover of 
self-rule authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  This meeting complements 'Arafat's meeting with the 
Palestinian leadership yesterday morning, which lasted for six 
hours. These meetings have particularly concentrated on putting 
down the final formation of the national authority council, 
headed by 'Arafat, and includes 12 members from inside the 
occupied territories and a similar number from abroad. 
  Palestinian sources say that the Fatah Central Committee has 
appointed -- during a meeting held at the end of this week in 
Tunis -- five of its members to take part in the self-rule 
authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  Palestinian observers believe that President 'Arafat is 
currently facing difficulties in selecting the team of his 
government because he wants this choice to take into account all 
the political, geographical, or tribal balances. 
  It remains to point out that the self-rule agreement, signed 
in Cairo on Wednesday last, stipulates for the establishment of 
Palestinian authority on 25 May instantly, and stipulates on 
informing Israel of the Palestinian formation that will assume 
power.

president of the state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO 
Executive Committee, met the night before last with the members 
of the Palestinian leadership in the PLO Executive Committee and 
the Central Committee of Fatah, the largest PLO faction. The 
meeting was devoted to discussing preparations to assume 
self-rule authority in Gaza and Jericho. 
  This meeting was a continuation of the one between brother 
Abu-'Ammar and the Palestinian leadership. These meetings are 
meant to prepare the final composition of the council of the 
National Authority, chaired by brother President Abu-'Ammar. 
The council includes 12 members from the occupied territories 
and 12 others from outside. The meetings are also discussing 
the formations of the institutions that will assume self-rule in 
Gaza and Jericho. 
  Meanwhile, it was announced in Tunis that five PLO Executive 
Committee members will be members of the Palestinian National 
Authority, which will include 24 personalities. Brother 
President Abu-'Ammar is holding intensive consultations to form 
this body. 
  AFP reported that the members of the PLO Executive Committee 
who will assume posts in the forthcoming authority are: 
  Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, for the Palestinian Democratic Union; 
Samir Ghawshah, for the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front; and 
three independent personalities: Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, 
Yasir 'Amr, and Jawid al-Ghusayn. 
  The Fatah Central Committee, led by brother President 
Abu-'Ammar, had earlier appointed five of its members to assume 
positions in the authority. Half of the members of the 
authority are from outside the occupied territories; the other 
half are from inside. 
  Sources close to Fatah said the five are: Nabil Sha'th, 
Ahmad Quray', and Intisar al-Wazir from outside; and Faysal 
al-Husayni and Zakariya al-Agha from inside.

  [Text] Tunis, 8 May (MENA)--PLO Executive Committee member 
Samir Ghawshah has stated that no decision has been made yet on 
the names of the members of the National Authority Council, 
which will take over self-rule responsibility in Gaza and 
Jericho. In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Tunis, 
Ghawshah said consultations are under way with the Palestinian 
leaders in the occupied territories to obtain their agreement to 
join the council. He added some leaders have agreed in principle 
to participate in the council, others have asked for more time 
to think about the subject, while many have declined to 
participate for various reasons. 
  Ghawshah said consultations are continuing between 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and the diaspora Palestinian 
leaders, including members of the PLO Executive Committee and 
the Fatah Central Council, to choose 12 members for the council 
from the diaspora. The 12 other members will be chosen from the 
occupied territories. 
  Ghawshah said he believes the formation of the council and 
the announcement of the names of its members will not be 
completed before Wednesday, 11 May, the date when 'Arafat will 
deliver to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin a list of the 
names of members of the National Authority Council and the 
self-rule establishments. 
  'Arafat continued consultations last night and this morning 
with the members of the PLO Executive Committee and the Fatah 
Central Council and the representatives of the Palestinian 
factions. 'Arafat will continue his consultations today before 
leaving for Johannesburg tonight to attend the inauguration of 
Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa. 
  Palestinian sources have stated that a number of prominent 
Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories have expressed a 
desire not to participate in the National Authority Council. 
They include Faysal al-Husayni, Fatah representative in the 
West Bank; and Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, chief Palestinian negotiator 
at the Washington talks. 
  Regarding the Palestinian personalities in the diaspora, it 
has become certain that Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political 
Department, will not participate in the council. The PLO 
Political Department will continue to operate from Tunis. 
Mahmud 'Abbas, also known as Abu-Mazin, head of the PLO 
National and International Relations Department, will also 
remain abroad to follow-up the talks on the final phase of the 
solution of the Palestinian issue.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview With Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F>
Palestinian negotiating team to the Cairo talks, in Tunis, by 
Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, reports say you 
apologized to Yasir 'Arafat regarding your appointment in the 
Palestinian national authority. How true are these reports? 
  [Sha'th] I was not nominated for this authority and I have 
not apologized. I do not know the source of these two reports. 
Thus far, no appointments have been announced and no one has 
been asked to do anything. I have not apologized to anyone for 
anything. These are only rumors. 
  [Mu'addi] The PLO leadership is discussing the formation of 
the Palestinian National Authority. How far have these 
discussions gone? 
  [Sha'th] I believe that in the next few days, maybe in the 
next three days, these names will be announced and given to the 
Israeli Government. 
  [Mu'addi] Let us move to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement 
signed last week in Cairo. What are the future steps, 
particularly regarding the deployment of Palestinian police 
force in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Sha'th] These forces are now massing in Rafah, on the 
Egyptian side of the border, and in Jordan, to prepare to cross 
into Gaza and Jericho. Naturally, there is some delay resulting 
from the civil war in Yemen and the fact that planes cannot fly 
in Libyan airspace. Our troops in Yemen will have to move by 
land to Saudi Arabia first, and our troops in Libya will have to 
move by land from Libya to Rafah. This will naturally cause 
some delay. But, troops are now in Rafah waiting for permission 
to cross. Troops are also in Amman preparing to move to the 
Jordan Valley and cross the Allenby Bridge. I think that in the 
next week or 10 days, these troops will enter to form the bulk 
of the Palestinian police force. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, regarding the talks on refugees, this 
issue has drawn some reaction in Israel. What did the Oslo 
Agreement stipulate in this regard? 
  [Sha'th] The Oslo Agreement is very clear. However, there 
are some people on the Israeli right who do not wish to read, or 
if they do read, do not wish to understand the agreement. The 
agreement says the four-sided committee--comprising Jordan, 
Egypt, Israel, and the Palestinian authority--will discuss the 
return of refugees who left after 1967 from only two aspects: 
Establishing the measures for their return and the measures to 
protect security and public order. There are no restrictions on 
the numbers or the principle of the return of these individuals. 
The issue concerns only measures. 
  [Mu'addi] When will the proceedings of the four-sided 
committee start? 
  [Sha'th] The decision was made in the letters exchanged 
between Chairman 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin that Israel 
and the PLO should invite Jordan and Egypt to the first meeting 
within a month after signing the agreement. That will be before 
4 June. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, "head of Fatah in the </F>
West Bank," by Yoni Ben-Menahem; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Ben-Menahem] Mr. al-Husayni, when will the future 
Palestinian authority be announced? 
  [Al-Husayni] I believe that this will take place within the 
next few days, whereby this authority will be able to take over 
all its powers when Israel concludes its withdrawal. Great 
tasks lie ahead of the authority that is to be established. 
These include implementation of the Cairo agreement, rebuilding 
the infrastructure in the areas from which the Israeli forces 
will pull out, preparing for deployment in the other areas from 
which Israel will withdraw in the future, and preparing for free 
and democratic elections that will be held in the middle of 
October. 
  [Ben-Menahem] Will you participate in the future Palestinian 
authority? 
  [Al-Husayni] If I am assigned to this authority I will 
discuss the assignment and see what my duty will be. If this is 
within my capabilities and abilities I believe that it will be 
incumbent upon me to accept. 
  [Ben-Menahem] According to reports, a large number of West 
Bank and Gaza Strip figures have expressed reservation in 
accepting participation in this authority. What is your 
position regarding this reservation? 
  [Al-Husayni] I believe we have the right to have 
reservations. I myself have reservations on the Cairo agreement, 
but we should not have reservations on performing our duties if 
this chance is provided to us in an open and good manner and if 
the powers and responsibilities are determined. If such an 
opportunity is offered to me and if the powers and 
responsibilities are determined and clear, I believe that I 
should accept. 
  [Ben-Menahem] Then according to your assessment those 
figures will not refuse the appointments by Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Al-Husayni] I believe that the position of a large number 
of those figures in terms of whether to accept or not stems from 
their lack of confidence that the picture and the 
responsibilities will be clear. Therefore, I believe that 
entering a new stage in which the responsibilities and powers 
are defined in a pyramidal way can serve the coming stage. 
  [Ben-Menahem] Is there a split between the residents of the 
occupied territories and the diaspora regarding the issue of the 
future Palestinian authority? Is it true that the residents do 
not accept those from the outside to arrive and govern the 
people? 
  [Al-Husayni] There is absolutely no such thing. In fact, I 
have met many people outside who hold opinions similar to those 
inside. I have also found many people inside who hold different 
opinions but they are identical with those of the outside. The 
issue is not inside or outside but how one thinks. A 
Palestinian may affiliate himself with the inside or outside 
irrespective of a position. 
  [Ben-Menahem] But do most of the figures in the West Bank 
fear that the outside, the PLO, will come here and govern the 
people? 
  [Al-Husayni] No. I do not believe there is such a thing, 
although if some are objecting it is against the decisionmaking 
approach. Some here have such reservations, but not so much 
against personalities as against the decisionmaking approach.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa al-Liddawi, representative of Hamas </F>
in Beirut, by Ja'far Salim and 'Abbas Surur; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [AL-'AHD] What happened recently between Hamas and 
the Jordanian Government? What are the reasons? 
  [Al-Liddawi] The progress achieved by Hamas, especially in 
the occupied territories, coincided with a clear decline in the 
PLO leadership's popularity. The PLO leadership did not like 
it. Through an alliance with Israel, it presented several 
complaints to the Americans against Jordan, where the Hamas 
representative and its official spokesman reside. Hakam 
Bal'awi's visit to Jordan and his talks with the Jordanian prime 
minister on the need to dwarf Hamas' role came within this 
context. The visit took place 15 days ago and it was followed 
by another visit to Jordan by Yasir 'Arafat, who tried to drive 
a wedge between Jordan and Hamas. 
  The other reasons given are not true; they are not the real 
reasons behind the threats to Jordan by Rabin and Peres. 
Statements by the Hamas official spokesman and representative 
in Jordan concerning the 'Afula and Hadera operations were made 
after the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam groups inside the occupied 
territories announced their responsibility for the two martyrdom 
operations. The operations were used as a pretext to implement 
this conspiracy against fraternal Jordan, to blackmail it, 
especially after Jordan's recent position toward the blockade of 
the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah and Jordan's link between its 
continuing participation in the bilateral talks and the lifting 
of the blockade. On top of this comes the painful impact of the 
martyrdom operations on the occupation government. 
  [AL-'AHD] It was said that Ibrahim Ghawshah and Muhammad 
Nazzal's passports were withdrawn. What information do you have 
on this? 
  [Al-Liddawi] We do not say that the Jordanian Government 
withdrew their passports. But after the news conference that 
King Husayn held in Amman following the Israeli threats to 
Jordan, the Jordanian foreign minister summoned Ghawshah and 
Nazzal to explain developments and the government's position on 
them. After listening to the two, the minister asked their 
permission to keep their passports with him. 
  [AL-'AHD] Many observers expect relations between Hamas and 
the Jordanian regime to become tense. 
  [Al-Liddawi] We do not expect such a thing. Our relations 
with the Jordanian Government remain good, despite what 
happened. Jordan appreciates that the Palestinian cause is 
important for it. There are many reasons leading it to create 
good relations with Hamas, which in turn appreciates Jordan's 
importance for the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people 
in general. We also deeply respect all the Arab and Islamic 
countries, especially those where we have an information, 
political, or charitable presence. We want their security to be 
stable, especially Jordan's. Hamas has no organizational 
infrastructure or armed presence outside Palestine. It is not 
our policy to embarrass Jordan or any other country. We believe 
that relations with Jordan will not be harmed by what happened. 
The government's recent measures against Hamas will not last. 
  [AL-'AHD] King Husayn's recent statements indicate that his 
regime recognizes only the PLO as the Palestinian people's 
legitimate representative. How do you view these statements? 
  [Al-Liddawi] This stance is not new. It has long been the 
Jordanian Government's official stance. So what is strange in 
the king's statements? He has said nothing new. 
  As for our stance on the legitimacy of 'Arafat and his 
organization's representation of the Palestinian people, we 
believe that neither the PLO nor Hamas represent the entire 
Palestinian people. In our view, the party that legitimately 
represents the Palestinian people is the one that will be 
brought forward by honest Palestinian elections in which all 
Palestinians participate, wherever they are. This is what we 
are calling for. 
  [AL-'AHD] Muhammad Nazzal told AL-'AHD two weeks ago that 
Hamas would hit the Israeli settlements with rockets. What is 
your comment on this? 
  [Al-Liddawi] That's what I and brother Muhammad Nazzal read 
in the statement issued by the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam 
Battalions in the occupied territories. It threatened the 
Zionists with more military operations against the enemy's 
soldiers and settlers in retaliation for the massacre 
perpetrated by the settlers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  We are expecting more painful operations against the enemy 
by 
the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions. 
  [AL-'AHD] Does this mean that the target of these operations 
will be the settlements built in the territories occupied in 
1967 or the ones throughout Palestine? 
  [Al-Liddawi] This question should be put to the Martyr 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions operating in occupied Palestine 
because all the planning, preparation, and implementation of all 
the military operations is carried out in the occupied 
territories. 
  [AL-'AHD] How do you envisage the relations between Hamas 
and Fatah in the event of the implementation of the self-rule in 
Gaza and Jericho and the entry of 'Arafat and the Palestinian 
police force into these two areas? 
  [Al-Liddawi] We yearn to maintain good relations with all 
the 
sides in the occupied territories. Fatah enjoys support in the 
occupied territories and any fighting between Hamas and Fatah 
would trigger the fire of civil war in Palestine. We must avoid 
this as far as we can. Any struggle between the two inside the 
occupied territories would be bloody and destructive to our 
people. We must, therefore, try hard to avoid any explosion of 
the situation. Proceeding from this perspective, we hold 
meetings with all the forces in the occupied territories, 
including Fatah and others. 
  Hamas will not take part in the Palestinian force that will 
be established in Gaza and Jericho. We hope this force will 
support our people and will not be a tool in the hands of the 
occupation authorities. 
  [AL-'AHD] Are you afraid there will be sedition, especially 
as many people predict there will be? 
  [Al-Liddawi] We are confident that sedition and infighting 
are an Israeli dream. Israel is paving the way for them. If 
there is sedition it will only serve the Zionist interests. It 
will be devastating for the people. We hope that everyone will 
realize the dangers and ramifications of sedition. We also hope 
that the people are aware of this and will do all they can to 
avoid it and undermine the objectives of the conspirators. 
  [AL-'AHD] How do you view the arms phenomenon in Palestine? 
Is the Mosad involved in supplying the arms? 
  [Al-Liddawi] Weapons are being distributed inside the 
occupied territories. Everyone is collecting the weapons for 
his own goals. Some people gather weapons for the sake of the 
resistance and jihad, while others store them for self-defense. 
But other people are collecting weapons with the help and 
planning of the Mosad to see that things flare up and any 
sedition worsens. We all know the objectives of the Israeli 
intelligence in stirring problems among the various parties. 
For this purpose, the intelligence service is exerting every 
effort and using its agents.

<F P=106> [Speeches by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and </F>
Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi during the meetings of 
the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee in Amman on 5 May 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Majali] In the name of God, the compassionate, 
the merciful. 
  Your Excellency brother 'Atif Sidqi, prime minister of 
fraternal Egypt. Your Excellencies the ministers. It is my 
pleasure to welcome Your Excellency and the accompanying 
delegation in their second country, Jordan, to take part in the 
meetings of the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee. 
These meetings are taking place within the context of 
intra-Arab cooperation and coordination, which we set in motion 
years ago in order to lay down the foundations for developing 
relations between our two fraternal countries in all fields. 
  The close relationship between His Majesty King Husayn and 
his brother His Excellency President Husni Mubarak, as well as 
our relentless work in the best interests of our two countries 
and the Arab nation, serve to advance understanding and common 
action for the good of our two countries and people. Jordan 
believes that sisterly Egypt is a key player regionally and 
globally and is shouldering real responsibilities and facing 
challenges. We are confident that the wisdom and enlightenment 
of the Egyptian leadership will help secure all the requirements 
for the advancement, success, and prosperity of the brotherly 
people of Egypt and surmount all the hurdles that impede their 
development and advancement. 
  For our part, let me assure you that we share your anxieties 
and concerns over the challenges and risks the region is facing 
and the divisions and differences besetting its countries and 
leaders which lay them open to outside interference and designs. 
Brotherly Egypt has in the past borne many burdens, and 
together we shouldered onerous responsibilities, and we stood 
side by side in the face of the danger and aggression that 
targeted our Arab nation. We are meeting today to engage in 
joint constructive work and an exchange of views and 
consultations. 
  Mr. prime minister, in light of the painful Arab situation 
and proceeding from the fact that we were the closest in terms 
of defending the nation's interest and the first to offer 
sacrifices for it, we, in Egypt and Jordan, must exert ourselves 
to revitalize Arab solidarity and disperse the disarray and 
weakness that have cast a shadow over Arab ties. 
  This is not to say that we mean to turn the status quo 
upside 
down or overlook facts or try the impossible. Against the 
background of the changes taking place around us, a combination 
of the state of Jordan's relations with other Arab states, our 
long experience, and our appreciation of the sensibilities of 
the political and economic dimensions of the current stage, puts 
us in a position to propose an objective approach to lift the 
Arabs from the gloom engulfing them to a new state where logic 
and reason are the norm. 
  To attain this and resolve Arab differences, let us adopt a 
step-by-step approach where common interests take precedence 
over regional and narrow concerns. It should thus be possible 
for us to overcome many obstacles and sensibilities and minor 
disagreements, and these are bound to disappear with the passage 
of time. Alternatively, we can boost Arab ties on a bilateral 
basis and, in effect, produce further Arab cooperation and 
rapprochement that may clear the way for normalized Arab ties. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, we realize the gravity of the situation 
and the sensitivity of the stage. We must act before it is too 
late. This can take place only if we freeze Arab differences 
and postpone them until we overcome this difficult and 
complicated era in our history, pinpoint the faults and 
weaknesses, benefit from the lessons we learned in the present 
stage, discard the solutions and rules that will be imposed on 
us without our being a party in formulating them, proceed with 
dexterity and loyalty to defend the nation's objectives and 
interests, end this painful state of affairs and enter into 
happier stages where sincere cooperation and constructive 
understanding will prevail. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, the tough circumstances our nation is 
experiencing makes it all the more urgent that we overcome these 
differences and put the past behind us. This is essential if we 
are to achieve solidarity and intra-Arab cohesion in the 
interest of Arab security. 
  From this perspective, and in response to the wish of the 
brothers in Yemen, Jordan exerted efforts to help pave the way 
for the appropriate atmosphere that made the parties to the 
political dialogue in Yemen reach the pledge and accord document 
that was signed under his majesty King Husayn's auspices in 
Amman on 20 February 1994. This document reflected a concensus 
to pursue building the unified Yemeni state. In this context, 
we sincerely wish the Yemeni brothers success in implementing 
this accord. 
  It pains us to hear today the reports about the military 
confrontations among them. We ask God to protect them from 
internecine fighting. He is the one who responds to wishes. 
  The painful state of affairs the fraternal Iraqi people are 
experiencing deserves from us every attention and serious 
thinking to support their salvation. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, you know that Jordan shares with 
fraternal Egypt the commitment and work for reaching a just, and 
lasting peace in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions 
242 and 338, the principles of international legitimacy, and the 
Madrid terms of reference on the return of the land in exchange 
for peace. Our participation also stems from a constant 
strategy and a deep conviction, and a genuine approach to attain 
a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution on all tracks; a 
peace that future generations will approve and that achieves 
stability, and secures the return of all the Arab rights and 
that will provide them with a free and dignified life, and avert 
the region conflicts and calamities. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, you know well what Jordan and His 
Majesty 
King Husayn have offered since the launching of the peace 
process in Madrid in terms of constructive and positive efforts 
and contributions to push the peace process ahead, to highlight 
the independent Palestinian identity, and enable the Palestinian 
command, the Palestinian people's legitimate and sole 
representative, to exercise its role in the peace process by 
providing the umbrella that made it possible for them to 
overcome the difficulties that obstructed the peace process, and 
allowed the Palestinian party to participate in the Madrid 
conference on an equal footing with the other parties. Out of 
its belief that the Palestinian cause is the core of the 
dispute, Jordan did not ratify the working agenda with the 
Israeli side, making it dependent on the attainment of real 
progress on the Palestinian track. When this progress was 
achieved through the independent decision and option embodied in 
the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles 
Jordan supported this agreement and ratified the joint 
Jordanian-Israeli agenda. Jordan has also alloted special 
importance to coordination among the Arab parties that are 
involved in the peace process and worked for enhancing it and 
institutionalizing it, hoping this will bolster the Arab stand 
of negotiation in a manner that will achieve the supreme 
interests of all the Arab parties through constant consultations 
and the exchange of views and the coordination of stands on the 
peace process and its developments. However, and with great 
regret, coordination did not rise to the aspired level and was 
governed by whims and seasonal stands. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, despite Jordan's constructive and 
positive role in the peace process, both the bilateral and 
multilateral parts of it, this role did not receive the support 
and appreciation it deserves. Pressures increased on Jordan by 
tightening the noose around the Gulf of Aqaba, Jordan's lungs 
and its economic outlet despite Jordan's commitment to the 
implementation of the resolutions of the international 
legitimacy; something which made us insist on the need to end 
this tribulation and the losses our economy is sustaining. 
  In light of the recent meeting between His Majesty King 
Husayn and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the 
positive signs that there is an understanding of the situation, 
and of the Jordanian request, and the possibility of reaching 
arrangements that would end this tribulation, we hope that this 
meeting will produce positive results, the blockade will be 
lifted, and a definitive solution to this problem found so 
Jordan can pursue its positive course toward the peace process. 
  Mr. Prime Minister: The changes on the international level, 
the emergence of the new world order, and the world's moving 
toward the formation of influential regional economic blocs and 
the development projects and programs the region could witness 
in the post-peace era makes us dutybound to review the Arab 
state of affairs from all its political, security, and economic 
aspects. The economic challenges that we could face soon calls 
on us to prepare ourselves to deal with them on sound and 
studied bases. Within this framework, there is a need to 
upgrade consultations, coordination, and the exchange of views 
in a manner that would secure the economic interests of our 
people and countries. 
  Our meeting today, and Your Excellency's visit to your 
second 
country embodies these objectives and expresses the fraternal 
relationship which binds us. This visit will give us the 
opportunity to review all that is important to us, whether in 
the field of enhancing bilateral relations, or tackling Arab and 
regional causes of mutual interest by placing them within the 
proper framework that serves the interests of the two fraternal 
peoples and achieve their aspirations and objectives. 
  I hope that their excellencies the brother ministers on both 
sides will meet, hold consultations, and work together. I am 
certain that their meetings will be permeated by an atmosphere 
of brotherhood. I have no doubt that we will emerge with 
positive results. 
  We support the PLO and consider it the sole legitimate 
representative [of the Palestinian people]. We will always 
stand on its side. Thank you. 
  [Sidqi] I cannot find words to express our thanks and 
appreciation for the warm hospitality my colleagues and I have 
received since our arrival yesterday. Jordan's warm hospitality 
and generosity is well known. Thank you, very much. 
  Thank you, Your Excellency, for the kind statements you just 
made about Egypt and the entire Arab nation, and for your good 
hopes about the future of intra-Arab cooperation. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, allow me to completely second everything 
you just said in this regard. Any objective observer of the 
Arab nation's situation following the Gulf war will totally 
agree with your analysis of this issue. Thanks to God, we have 
begun to overcome this stage, which I do not want describe 
because this is not something for the listeners' ears. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, allow me to say that I, as well as all 
of Egypt, second every word you have said about this broad field 
concerning our hopes for the Arab nation, which go far beyond 
what currently exists on the ground. True, there are some 
efforts being exerted in this area. These attempts, however, 
cannot deal with the difficult situation the Arab nation now 
faces. 
  Your Excellency, allow me to add that we carry our 
appreciation and love to fraternal Jordan. We bring all our 
pride in and recognition of Jordan's serious and effective role 
in events in the Arab arena. If we recall the history of the 
Arab nation, at least in recent times, or what we can call the 
contemporary period, we find that Jordan has played, and is 
still playing, a principle and basic role in all the events 
facing this nation. 
  That is not all. Jordan plays a role that extends beyond the 
Arab arena in to the international arena, due to His Majesty 
King Husayn's wisdom and ability to hold contacts and dialogues 
that serve the interests of the generous Arab nation, which Your 
Excellency spoke about at length. 
  We came to convey this message. We came to say that through 
this meeting we, as Your Excellency said, truly want to overcome 
a stage and period that was really a painful period. I second 
Your Excellency's statement that it is our duty to look toward 
the future. In terms of dealing with the past, Jordan and Egypt 
together can play a basic role in achieving the reconciliation 
that is needed between Arab countries. I say necessary 
reconciliation because the Arab nation will not be able to face 
what is currently taking place around it and, indeed, what will 
soon take place inside it, if it has not already begun to do 
that in terms of events and challenges which no one Arab country 
can face on its own. We did well. I say frankly that this is 
due to your initiative and His Majesty King Husayn's initiative 
to bring Jordan and Egypt closer again. We all hope to achieve 
this. 
  Your Excellency, you have touched on a very important and 
serious issue that, I believe, is known by everyone in Jordan 
and Egypt. I do not think anyone in either country can belittle 
the grave and momentous challenges we face. 
  Let us leave the Arab nation and take a look at what is 
taking place in the world. As Your Excellency said, the world 
is heading toward a new situation. I must stress that none of 
us can face this situation alone. 
  Yesterday, I talked with some of the brother members of the 
fraternal Jordanian delegation. In fact, at least in the field 
of economic coordination, cooperation, and integration, the Arab 
Common Market was signed in March or April 1957 before the 
signing of the European Common Market [ECM]. As you are aware, 
the ECM was signed in May 1957, one or two months after us. 
They have now arrived at semi-unity, not only economic unity 
but economic and political unity, and will have full unity by 
the end of the century. We are still talking about the 
importance of this matter and this necessary thing. Points of 
similarity and identity among Arab nations are greater than 
those in Western Europe. 
  How can we deal with these blocs when we are separated, each 
on his own, and when we are unable to complete the coordination 
reached in the past?. This coordination was cut. We want to 
resume it, and we cannot do this. As Your Excellency is aware, 
and as I and all the brothers present here, Jordanian or 
Egyptian, are aware, there are difficulties and things that 
prevent the completion of this agreement, or coordination. Why? 
I do not know. 
  Today -- and we have all heard about it, nothing can hide in 
the modern world -- how can we face contemporary developments in 
the region, the approach toward peace. This course cannot be 
reversed. Neither in regard to the Palestinian brothers -- and 
Your Excellency referred to this very accurately and clearly. 
[sentence as heard]. Jordan and Syria are proceeding on the same 
path. Lebanon is the same. After a short while, everything ... 
[pauses] I mean this thing is inevitable. Even if there are 
snags or differences between the Arab and Israelis sides. The 
Arab side is represented by Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and even 
Palestine. Until yesterday there were differences that had to 
be agreed on. This is not the end, this is the beginning of a 
phase that brings numerous challenges to all of us. 
  I would like to note one point, namely, what we hear -- and 
I 
have just said nothing remains secret -- of preparations for the 
so- called Middle Eastern market. Will Jordan, Egypt, Syria, 
Lebanon, or any Gulf state enter this market alone? I do not 
think so. A kind of full cooperation and coordination among all 
of us is necessary. What Jordan produces, Egypt does not, and 
what Egypt produces, Jordan does not. Thus, cooperation and 
integration in the sense we all know will be realized. 
  The challenges are great. The most dangerous is this latest 
challenge that deals with the possibility of establishing a 
Middle Eastern market. This is just an idea that has not 
materialized yet. But I think the significance of this is that 
there can be only cooperation between the states in the region. 
The peace is being made to pave the way for this. This is my 
view. All the peace arrangements are designed in order to have 
a sort of economic coordination and the establishment of a 
Middle East market in which Israel plays a basic role. This is 
no secret to you or to us or to anyone on the Arab nation. All 
these preparations are being done to establish this Middle 
Eastern market. The question is very serious. We we cannot face 
it in silence. I have proposed to Your Excellency in passing 
during our talks yesterday that these dangers and challenges 
require us to sit together, think together, and cooperate and 
then integrate in order to enter as one front in this market, if 
possible. This is possible, there is nothing impossible. We 
can now realize that differences occur even among friends but 
these are settled in the end. 
  When differences occurred on the GATT between the United 
States on the one hand and Western Europe, especially France, on 
the other, they settled these differences. They did not leave 
each other and remain in their own countries, discussing issues 
in confusion. They sat down and settled their differences. We 
must do the same regardless of the differences among us and 
regardless of the variance in interests. I am fully in 
agreement with Your Excellency on joint issues, joint interests. 
The subjective issues and issues that deal with each state 
alone can be done by each state alone as far as is possible. If 
it needs cooperation from others, well and good, as you have 
done with our brothers in Yemen and as we have also tried to do 
with them. Regrettably, you are aware that the news from Yemen 
is absolutely worrisome. 
  The coming challenges are very great. They require all of 
us, not only Jordan and Egypt, to forget and bypass -- as Your 
Excellency said -- the differences that exist now. If we sit 
down together all these differences will be liquidated. I am 
aware that many sides, especially the Arab League, are exerting 
efforts to realize this objective and support this. I pray God 
will speed their efforts. 
  Please allow me to say something about Egypt's cares and 
problems, which you hear about in Egyptian press and other 
media. There is an unlimited exaggeration of the problem of 
terrorism in Egypt. In fact, we in Egypt do not feel it as do 
others who look toward Egypt, like the foreign press, radios, 
television and other channels. Advances in television are such 
that today in Amman you can see America and Asia. There are 
exaggerations about some terrorist incidents in Egypt. I do not 
know the reason for these exaggerations. I say there are some 
sporadic incidents. 
  Another subject, which I will briefly mention because it is 
a 
wide subject. We are all in the same boat regarding it, namely, 
the process of contacting international bodies, the IMF or the 
World Bank. I am aware that Jordan has contacts with these two 
international bodies. Egypt has been having continuous contacts 
with them. This is because we needed them in the process of 
rescheduling the debts that accumulated. We are embarking on an 
economic reform program which is characterized by encouraging 
private economic activities and the privitization of part of the 
public sector. 
  There is also the rectification of disorder in various 
structures, be it the balance of payment ... [pauses] now we 
have a surplus. The general budget's deficit is disappearing. 
This year it will only be 2 percent. The inflation rates have 
dropped. in 1986, the inflation was 25-26 percent. Some say it 
was 30 and 35 percent. Today, by all estimations, inflation 
does not exceed 7.3 percent. This demonstrates that economic 
reform is proceeding at a good rate. We are continuing, with 
the IMF and the bank, or without them. We will complete the 
program of the economic reform. I am aware that Jordan is 
proceeding in the same direction and it has had good results in 
the economic reform program. 
  On the issue of the problem [words indistinct] Germany, 
Italy. All these states are exposed [pauses] Turkey, which is a 
neighboring state and we are aware of its news. What is 
happening in Egypt is very little, God be praised. It has not 
affected the course of the Egyptian economy as these people 
wanted. It affected tourism but did not affect the other 
various economic sectors. The investment sector is good. There 
is a great rate of investment which is increasing month by 
month, both Arab and foreign investments received in Egypt. 
This is a sign of trust in Egypt and its economy. 
  Concerning terrorism, I really wanted to place before the 
eyes of Your Excellency and the brother members of the Jordanian 
delegation, that it is not as serious as it seems in some papers 
and radio and television broadcasts--CNN and others. Now they 
are retreating from this method because they found that it is no 
use. However, I wanted to place this picture before Your 
Excellency so that you may be reassured about Egypt. It is now 
in good shape and will always remain in good shape in the 
service of the Arab nation. 
  We are coming with an open heart and open minds and we 
expect 
good results from this meeting of the Joint Egyptian-Jordanian 
Higher Committee after a period of leave that extended for about 
four years. However, we are returning with complete 
understanding of the nature of the current phase and the need to 
realize what Your Excellency proposed. This is because no Arab 
country can live alone in this contemporary world with all its 
huge challenges. If these challenges are not faced with unity 
and integration, their negative results on the Arab states will 
be greater than anyone can imagine. Only God knows the extent of 
this negative side. 
  In conclusion, I hope that you will accept from me and my 
colleague our thanks and appreciation for the very cordial 
hospitality you accorded us since we arrived in fraternal Jordan 
last night. I hope that Egyptian-Jordanian relations will 
witness progress, success, and expansion in all fields, and I 
wish all of you health and success. I hope the meeting of this 
committee will realize what we all are aspiring to realize. God 
willing, this meeting will be followed by other meeting and we 
hope they will be held in Cairo next time. On this occasion, I 
extend an invitation for Your Excellency and your minister 
colleagues at a time which we will agree on at the end of this 
round. 
  I wish Jordan and its beloved king happiness, health, and 
success, God willing. 
  Peace and blessings of God be upon you.

  [Text] The meetings of the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher 
Committee concluded in Amman this afternoon. The final session, 
held at the Prime Ministry, was cochaired by Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi. 
  At the conclusion of the session, Dr. al-Majali and Dr. 
Sidqi 
signed the minutes of the committee. A final statement was then 
issued. The statement addressed the current Arab situation and 
the growing relations between the two fraternal countries, as 
well as ways of enhancing them in all fields. Dr. al-Majali and 
Dr. Sidqi also held a news conference in which they answered 
reporters' questions in all fields. Details are in the 
following report: 
  Following the signing ceremony of the minutes of the Joint 
Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee, Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi held a news conference in which they spoke about the 
results of the meetings and answered questions by reporters and 
other media representatives. 
  Dr. Ziyad Fariz, the minister of planning and acting 
minister 
of industry and trade, who chaired the Jordanian side to the 
meetings of the preparatory committee, read a press statement, 
saying: 
  "In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. A 
press statement: On this blessed morning, praise be to God, the 
Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee concluded its meetings 
at the Prime Ministry under Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, prime 
minister of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi, prime minister of the Arab Republic of Egypt. 
  "The two sides stressed the importance of these meetings 
within the framework of their quest for cooperation, 
coordination, and joint action launched by the two countries 
years ago in order to lay the foundations for developing 
relations between the two fraternal countries in all fields. 
  "During these meetings, there was a review of Arab, 
regional, 
and international developments, as well as the role of the 
leadership in both countries, and their fraternal relations, in 
promoting joint Arab action and achieving Arab interests in the 
face of challenges and threats to the region and the problems 
and disputes this region is suffering, which could subject it to 
foreign intervention and ambitions. 
  "The two sides called for efforts to resume the drive for 
Arab solidarity and for organizing inter-Arab relations through 
resolving Arab differences in accordance with a pan-Arab 
perspective that focuses on the Arab nation's common interests 
and concerns. 
  "Out of the awareness of the two sides of the critical and 
important nature of the current stage being experienced by the 
Arab nation and the region in general, in addition to 
international changes, such as the emergence of influential 
regional economic blocs, the two sides stressed the importance 
of a comprehensive review of the Arab situation, in terms of its 
political, security, and economic aspects, to help in facing the 
emergent challenges. 
  "The two sides expressed their intense concern and distress 
over the serious, fast-paced developments in Yemen. They urge 
the brothers to stop fighting immediately and return to 
political dialogue to settle the crisis. This would preserve 
the unity and interests of the fraternal Yemeni people. 
  "The two sides also expressed hope that the problem of 
inspecting al-'Aqabah-bound vessels would be settled in a manner 
that safeguards Jordan's interests. 
  "The two sides stressed the importance of activating the 
work 
of the committees studying the relations of various sectors in 
the two countries, as well as the need for these committees to 
meet to ensure continued dialogue and coordination between the 
two sides on all levels. 
  "The decisions also provide for cooperation in all fields, 
the most important of which are: Political coordination: The 
two sides stressed the important role that Egypt and Jordan can 
play to restore Arab solidarity and create a unified Arab 
position on various issues. This is in addition to coordination 
and consultation on various regional and international issues, 
and facing the new developments on the regional and Arab levels. 
They also welcome the signing of the Cairo agreement for 
Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, as a step down the 
road to reaching a just, lasting, and comprehensive solution in 
the region." 
  In the economic field, the statement notes an agreement to 
form an economic working team to devise a joint mechanism to 
discuss regional and international issues and cooperation and 
coordination in these fields. The two sides also reviewed the 
status of the Egyptian-Jordanian Investment Company and its 
plans in both countries. 
  The statement also notes an agreement to implement Trade 
Protocol No. 1 that stemmed from the agreement signed in 1992. 
The two sides stressed the importance and need for coordination 
and exchange of expertise in financial affairs, planning, 
energy, mining, agriculture, water, transportation and 
communications, health and medicine, tourism, culture and 
information, in addition to activating a cooperation agreement 
in the field of manpower. 
  In the field of higher education, the final statement says: 
  "It has been agreed that the Jordanian Ministry of Higher 
Education will set aside 100 seats annually for the Egyptian 
Ministry of Higher Education for the first university degree in 
various specialties. In return, the Egyptian Ministry of Higher 
Education will set aside 110 seats for the Jordanian Ministry of 
Higher Education for graduate studies, in addition to 15 seats 
as scholarships for graduate studies and 300 seats annually for 
the first university degree at Egyptian universities." 
  After the press statement was read, Dr.al-Majali and Dr. 
Sidqi replied to journalists' questions. 
  On his meeting with His Majesty King Husayn yesterday, 
Dr.'Atif Sidqi said: 
  "The truth is that I was honored yesterday when His Majesty 
King Husayn received me and my colleagues, the members of the 
accompanying delegation. We spoke with all clarity and 
frankness about the present Arab state of affairs, the state of 
affairs the Arab nation is experiencing. His majesty's 
viewpoints and those of the prime minister are nearly the same 
as our viewpoints and analysis in Egypt, both of His Excellency 
President Husni Mubarak and the government. Of course, there is 
always a complete agreement on these issues. 
  "However, the main problem, the topical issue during this 
meeting was the question of Yemen -- of course, you all are 
following this issue -- and the efforts Jordan has exerted to 
reconcile the two Yemeni sides, as well as the efforts Egypt has 
and is still exerting in this respect. These efforts were also 
discussed. The objective of his majesty the king and of Jordan 
is the same as that of His Excellency President Mubarak and of 
Egypt. 
  "There were also His Majesty King Husayn's statements about 
the relations between Egypt and Jordan. I would like to 
emphasize to you that these relations have always been good. 
His majesty the king visited Egypt. God willing, His 
Excellency President Husni Mubarak will do the same, will visit 
his brother in Jordan. Thanks be to God, we overcame the 
susceptibilities that used to exist. I say that I sensed during 
my meeting with his majesty the king that his policies are 
pan-Arab and in the interest of the entire Arab nation. His 
majesty is fully concerned that we emerge from the present 
differences in the Arab arena to a state of affairs that will 
bring good through peaceful and objective methods." 
  Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali replied to a 
question on the nature of the Jordanian-Palestinian relations, 
saying: 
  "The Jordanian-Palestinian relationship is a unique 
relationship that stands out. We were not satisfied with the 
coordination because we always felt and believed that 
coordination should always be on all levels and in the best of 
circumstances. But, at the same time, we excused the brothers 
because they were busy with major political issues in their 
negotiations with Israel. There was no opportunity for 
coordination as we had wished. However, the coordination, to 
some extent, was good. Now that the signing has taken place, we 
hope and I explained this to His Excellency President Yasir 
'Arafat -- and His Majesty King Husayn has also told brother 
'Arafat -- that the time has come to have the various committees 
meet because it is essential to do so. We believe that the 
reasons that may once have stood in the way of good coordination 
no longer exist after the signing. We ask God that this takes 
place in the near future." 
  In response to a question concerning developments on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track in the peace process and the siege 
imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah, especially after His Majesty 
King Husayn's recent meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, Dr. al-Majali said: 
  "Concerning the siege of al-'Aqabah, I have recently noted 
that, since that meeting, no inspections have been carried out. 
But is it over? We are still awaiting the final word and final 
decision. We hope that we will receive word soon. There are 
still some complications regarding the way matters will be 
conducted. As to what extent this issue will influence the 
course of events, I told you that we cannot have intensive 
participation in the multilateral talks, in which the main 
focuses are economic and social, at a time when we are still 
under the economic pressure of the siege. 
  "However, in such matters, we do not believe in secrecy, 
threats, or warnings. We have pursued a cultural approach. We 
have participated in multilateral negotiations, but at a low 
level. This is because we want the entire world to hear that we 
are being wronged. I believe that the world has heard us. We 
have noticed interest by all parties. A short while ago and 
during the meetings, his excellency the brother [Egyptian] prime 
minister clearly expressed concern over the situation to which 
this siege has led. We will collectively work to make sure that 
the siege will not be maintained or reimposed. 
  "The bilateral talks, I believe, were suspended because of 
what had happened in Hebron. After the signing of Palestinian 
agreement in Cairo, I believe the two cosponsors will make sure 
that these negotiations are resumed. Of course, we always 
believe in the need for a comprehensive solution. Therefore, we 
hope that there will be progress on other tracks, besides the 
Jordanian track, so that we can arrive at a comprehensive, just 
solution. 
  "By the way, I want to answer a question that has not been 
posed. Some people, misunderstanding the situation, believe that 
the Palestinians have reached a separate solution. For the next 
two years, it should be noted, the brother Palestinians will be 
negotiating what we started negotiating two years ago. The 
issue they are negotiating differs from the issues that we, the 
Syrians, and the Lebanese are negotiating. Therefore, I believe 
that what they have arrived at is an essential step. God 
willing, this step will be so positive that they will need less 
than two years and they will begin negotiations on the final 
status as soon as possible so that all these tracks can move 
with relatively equal pace." 
  On the positive steps being taken to achieve Arab 
reconciliation, Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi said: 
  "It is official Egyptian policy that Egypt welcomes Arab 
reconciliation. Therefore, we have welcomed the Arab League's 
efforts in this regard. Arab reconciliation has started, but we 
have not reached the end. We must be frank with ourselves. We 
must not bury our heads in the sand. A reconciliation must be 
effected." 
  [Al-Majali] "If his excellency the prime minister permits me 
to interrupt, I would like to say that the appropriate approach 
would be to declare that we [the Arabs] will solve our 
differences, but over a specific number of years [Egyptian Prime 
Minister Sidqi is heard saying "exactly"]. The first three to 
four years would serve as a grace period, during which we would 
not raise this issue, but look for points of agreement. We 
should have a collective stand on the new regional order being 
planned for this region. If we can do so and put off the 
differences until a later stage. Then, differences will be 
examined and everyone will be told whether he is right or wrong. 
This may be the key. The Arab League will then call on all 
brothers to put off their differences. We cannot tell them 
forget these differences all at once. [Sidqi is heard 
commenting "this is impossible"] Rather, shelve them for a 
while until we cross the very serious bridge lying ahead of us, 
for fear that we all might be drowned." 
  [Sidqi] "Also, with the permission of His Excellency 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, please allow to reaffirm that this is 
the best approach. We should go into this process step by step. 
Sharp differences can be shelved. We can start from the points 
of agreement. This is the practical and sound approach. I 
believe this is the approach that is being pursued."

  [Text] India would have to reappraise the country's 
defense requirements and take adequate steps to safeguard its 
security in view of Pakistan's acquisition of sophisticated 
military equipment. The minister of state for external affairs, 
Mr. Salman Khurshid, told the Lok Sabha during question hour 
today that the government has conveyed that the U.S. proposal to 
transfer F-16 aircraft and other military equipment to Pakistan 
is a matter of deep concern for India. In a written reply, the 
minister said the U.S. Government has not pressed for nuclear 
capping by India as they have proposed to Pakistan as a 
condition to supplying F-16 fighters. 
  In another written reply, Mr. Salman Khurshid informed the 
house that the government has consistently maintained that it 
will not sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] in its present 
form because of its discriminatory nature. Referring to the 
efforts by the U.S. administration to modify the Pressler 
Amendment, the minister said latest reports indicate that these 
efforts have not been successful.

  [Excerpts] Baghdad, May 8, INA--AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper of 
Baghdad today said that no one imagined that affairs in Yemen 
would turn into such military confrontations as if they were 
between enemies and not brothers from one country. [passage 
omitted] 
  The English language newspaper `THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER' 
editorially commented on the military battles raging in Yemen 
and said the crisis there is a result of foreign and internal 
factors. 
  The paper said the United States and Saudia [Saudi Arabia] 
as 
well as the Kuwaiti regime have worked covertly and in the open 
to destabilize the security and political situation in Yemen. 
Although the three parties are united in their opposition to 
any Arab gathering that could become a nucleus for a pan-Arab 
unity, each party has its own motives in opposing any Arab unity. 
  The United States along with the world Zionism are against 
the unity of the Arab nation so that the Arabs remain weak and 
suffer from their international divisions and differences. 
  The Iraqi paper further said that Israel in occupied 
Palestine will remain having the upper hand over the Arabs. 
  The U.S. showed indifference to the Yemen unity at the 
beginning because it felt that the Yemen unity would serve its 
global policy of winning footholds against the former USSR since 
south Yemen used to be an ally of the latter. 
  But since the collapse of the former USSR and the discovery 
of oil in the southern part of Yemen, the U.S. policy towards 
Yemen has shifted to its previous approach. 
  The paper added that the U.S. touches in the current Yemen 
crisis are indicated in the suspicious roles played by the U.S. 
ambassador to Yemen and other U.S. officials who are playing an 
agitating role in the Yemen crisis. 
  The U.S. influence on Yemen affairs has increased with the 
increasing number of U.S. oil companies digging for oil. 
Currently there are about 26 U.S. companies having oil 
contracts with Yemen. 
  The official invitations being extended to a number of 
Yemeni 
officials, journalists, and politicians is another tactic used 
by the U.S. Administration and its agencies to win political and 
economic influence in Yemen. 
  It added that the Saudis, for their part, are playing the 
same suspicious role played by the U.S. Administration in that 
since the unification of the two parts of Yemen, the Saudis 
increased their support to feudalism and tribalism in Yemen to 
destabilize the security and political situation in that Arab 
country. 
  Since then Saudi Arabia has expelled thousands of Yemeni 
expatriates and made extra territorial claims against Yemen. 
  This Saudi stance is in line with their government's 
customary policy of opposing any Arab economic or political 
unity. 
  The paper pointed out that the Kuwaitis for their part 
played 
an agitating role trying to castigate the Yemeni leadership for 
its support for Iraq during the U.S.-led aggression on the 
country. 
  So what is going on in Yemen nowadays is a result of a 
regional and international conspiracy to destroy the fragile 
Yemen unity and once again bring about its fragmentation. 
  If this is allowed to happen, it would be in the interest of 
the enemies of the Arab nation and very deterimental to Arab 
interests.

  [Text] Baghdad, May 8, INA -- Deputy head of the 
Information Department at the Popular General Conference Party 
in Yemen 'Abd-al-Karim al-Khamisi has emphasised that what is 
happening in Yemen now is not but a rebellion against legitimacy 
and democracy and violation of the national invariables on whose 
foundations the yemen unity was founded. 
  In an interview to AL-JUMHURIYAH daily of Baghdad during his 
stay in Baghdad he said the political crisis in Yemen was a 
perilous action but not of the volume leading to a bloody 
military confrontation. He made it clear that what the media 
hostile to Yemen unity were mentioning in that what was going on 
in Yemen as fighting between the north and the south or conflict 
between the conference and the Socialist parties was groundless. 
  What is true, the Yemeni political official said, is that 
confirmed by the tangible reality affirming that the conflict is 
now beteen the unionists and their enemies and between 
legitimacy and illegitimacy. The proof is that all the national 
forces believing in the issue of unity and democracy of various 
political affiliations throughout Yemen are now standing abreast 
to encounter the rebellion in defense of the people's will that 
emerged in the elections of April 27, 1993 and clearly appeared 
on May 22, 1990, the day when the unity was declared. 
  He has added that one of the more significant of the 
constants on which the unity has been built is democracy, 
political plurality and peaceful exchange of power. 
  On the strength of these invariables the Yemeni people have 
gone to ballot boxes to choose the pursuit it accepts. And 
prior to the day of balloting all the political parties and 
organisations publicly announced that they would abide by 
outcomes of the elections, Mr al-Khamisi added. 
  He elaborated that following a short period there emerged on 
the surface indicators denoting that some of those who abided by 
the nation arbitration were not sincere in their commitment. 
And hence the crisis has begun and which in the beginning was 
putting on the mask of modernisation and reform. But this mask 
has fallen down in Amman after the conclusion of the document of 
pledge and agreement and then the world realised who was sincere 
and who was hesitant. The Yemeni official maintained that the 
secessionist intentions were disclosed and the political and 
military events speeded up till they have reached the current 
painful military confrontation. Mr 'Abd-al Karim al-Khamisi 
has further pointed out that those who backed up the tyrannous 
conspiracy on Iraq were the same today standing behind the 
militay mutiny against the legitimacy in Yemen. He asked all the 
Arab unionists to resolutely stand against any conspiring on the 
Yemen unity. It is considered, he further added, a prominent 
pan-Arab accomplishment in our contemporary age because setback 
of the unity constitutes a painful blow to the Arab dream 
aspiring for a prosperous Arab future. 
  Mr al-Khamisi also called upon all Arab countries to defend 
the Yemen unity against any conspiracy.

  [Text] Baghdad, 8 May (INA)--The AL-THAWRAH newspaper has 
said our Kurdish people are the principal losers in the bloody 
clashes taking place between the Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal 
Talabani groups in northern Iraq. The newspaper, the mouthpiece 
of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, says in an article today that 
our people have been afflicted by these agents, servants of 
foreigners, and other criminals and highwaymen. 
  The newspaper adds: Current events in northern Iraq are 
taking place under foreign interference in Iraq's domestic 
affairs and in the absence of a central authority, which can run 
the affairs of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, which enjoyed 
prosperity before the 30-state aggression. 
  The newspaper says that as a result of the current situation 
in northern Iraq, our Kurish people have won nothing but hunger, 
death, destruction, displacement, the absence of security, and 
the stealing and smuggling of the property of the state and the 
people, and that the region has become a fertile ground for 
terrorists, foreigners, and Zionist and foreign espionage 
networks. 
  The paper adds that Iraq has several times warned against 
foreign interference, but there are people who enjoy living 
under the bayonets of the United States and other sides, who 
want to serve foreigners at the expense of their brothers, and 
who tamper with the people's security in the Kurdistan 
Autonomous Region. 
  The paper stresses that due to foreign interference in 
domestic affairs, the situation in northern Iraq has become very 
bad. 
  The newspaper says established historical and geographic 
facts for thousands of years, as well as the real feelings of 
the sons of our Kurdish people in northern Iraq, indicate that 
the future is a for strong, unified Iraq under the leadership of 
President Saddam Husayn. 
  The paper says that all the conspiracies of the Zionist 
enemies and the servants of foreigners will go to waste, and 
history will remember the positions of the men who defended 
national unity and Iraq's honor. 
  Concluding, the paper says history will have no mercy on 
those who remain outside the national ranks and who carry 
weapons to harm Iraq's unity and serve foreigners.

  [Text] Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that 
speaking at a lecture in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
said Israel is not committed to allow the return of Palestinian 
refugees from the Six-Day War. Mr. Rabin pointed that according 
to the Oslo Declaration of Principles, a quadripartite committee 
consisting of Israel, the PLO, Egypt, and Jordan will be set up 
to discuss the question of these refugees. The prime minister 
affirmed that Israel is in no way committed to the figures cited 
in this context or to return the refugees. He went on to say 
that the issue of the War of Independence refugees will be 
discussed in the negotiations on the permanent solution, while 
Israel, for its part, will raise the question of the Jewish 
refugees from the Arab countries. 
  Referring to the Knesset members [MK] holed up in a 
synagogue 
in Jericho, Mr. Rabin described their actions a political 
manifestation under false religious pretenses. He pointed out 
that the MK's presence at the site necessitates the deployment 
of soldiers to watch over them. He said it is shameful that 
MK's should count on the fact that no order will be issued to 
forcibly evacuate them because of their parliamentary immunity. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Rabin noted, such wanton behavior may make it 
necessary to take the appropriate steps. In the meantime, until 
a decision is made, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will guard 
them. 
  Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that the commander of 
the Central Command decided to allow MK's Hanan Porat and Dov 
Shilansky, along with a group of worshipers, to stay in the 
synagogue in Jericho until the end of the Sabbath, tomorrow 
evening. On Sunday and Monday, they will only be allowed to 
stay on the site during the daytime. The MK's promised that 
their supporters will leave the premises in the evening. The 
MK's said that in view of the prime minister's denunciation, 
they regard this decision as a kind of achievement that speaks 
for itself.

  [Text] Major General Matan Vilna'i, commander of the 
Southern Command, has said there is as yet no timetable for the 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. The area will be handed over to 
the Palestinians only after three conditions are met: the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] fully completes its deployment to 
protect the Jewish settlements, a liaison mechanism is set up, 
and the Palestinians are ready to enter the area. 
  Gen. Vilna'i said that according to plans, Palestinian 
policemen will enter the Gaza Strip within the next few days and 
that the IDF will hand over to them some 30 facilities formerly 
used by the IDF, the Prison Authority, and the Israel Police. 
He added that there will be no overlap in responsibility for 
the area, and that responsibility will be transferred in its 
entirety at a specific time. The transfer of powers will not be 
accompanied by joint Israeli-Palestinian ceremonies to prevent 
tempers from flaring, he noted. 
  Maj. Gen. 'Uzi Dayan, head of the General Staff's Planning 
Branch and a participant in the Cairo talks, said that all the 
points important to Israel had been safeguarded in the security 
segment of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Our correspondent 
Karmela Menashe reports that the two generals were speaking at a 
news conference in Tel Aviv.

  [Text] The international force of observers is beginning 
its duties in Hebron today. The 160-strong force, including 
support staff and experts, comes from Norway, Denmark, and Italy 
and was agreed on by Israel and the PLO following the Hebron 
massacre in February. Mark Weiss reports from Hebron: 
  [Begin Weiss recording] I am speaking from the Hebron 
Municipality building. The international observer force has 
arrived in the town and has just been welcomed by Mayor 
al-Natshah at the Municipality building. He expressed [word 
indistinct] that the people will feel safer because of the 
arrival of the temporary international presence. He expects all 
the population to cooperate despite reports of threats from 
Islamic fundamentalists. The mayor told me that tomorrow a 
meeting will be held between the international observers and the 
Islamic fundamentalists in the town. The mayor said he believed 
their arrival will reduce the level of violence in the city. 
The observers arrived in a fleet of white Fiat Uno cars flying 
a white flag. They are all dressed in smart white uniforms. 
For most of them it is the first time they have arrived in the 
town and they are actually due to begin their work tomorrow.

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to 
arrive in Israel next Saturday [14 May] for shuttle diplomacy 
between Israel and Damascus. His arrival is due right after the 
Knesset is to vote on the Gaza-Jericho accord. David Ze'ev 
reports: 
  [Begin Ze'ev recording] American and Israeli officials say 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to arrive 
here on Saturday. According to the plan, he will have 24 hours 
during which to have talks with Israeli officials after the 
Sabbath and before the festival of Pentecost begins the night 
after. He would spend the Jewish festival in Damascus. 
  The Prime Minister's Office continues to insist that it does 
not share the optimism of the American secretary of state of the 
new substantive phase in the negotiations with Syria. In fact, 
an official in Jerusalem last night said Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin has given a cool response to pressing on the Syrian track, 
as Israel still tries to digest the accord signed last week with 
the Palestinians. 
  As the new Palestinian self-rule begins to take effect on 
the 
ground, the Knesset will be requested to give its endorsement. 
Prime Minister Rabin is expected to ask the cabinet secretary 
today to present the agreements to the parliament. But because 
of the Histadrut election, the house will not meet Tuesday [10 
May], and the debate is not expected until Wednesday. The 
government has the numbers to prevail. The debate before the 
vote will be a long one. Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss' office 
said last night he supports giving all 120 members of the house 
the opportunity to speak. The Wednesday session in the plenum 
is being rescheduled to start earlier in the day than originally 
planned, but still the estimate is that the second day of the 
debate on Thursday will last until late into the night if not 
Friday morning, and then the vote will take place. 
  The speaker makes the point that the Knesset vote is not 
actually binding on the government, but that it is taking place 
based on the precedent established by the Camp David accords 
with Egypt and followed last September when the Knesset approved 
the declaration of principles with the PLO. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Rabin says Israel is interested in getting 
its 
troops out of the Gaza Strip, but that the withdrawal must be 
carried out in an orderly fashion. The premier said the 
timetable of the pullout will be determined based on 
arrangements worked out between working groups of the two sides. 
Rabin was responding to a Qol Yisra'el reporter's question at a 
Histadrut election rally in Beersheba.

<F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Itamar Rabinovich, </F>
Israel's ambassador to the United States and the head of the 
delegation to the negotiations with Syria, by Mikha Friedman and 
Ya'el Dan, on 8 May; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Friedman] Earlier this morning we spoke with 
Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United 
States and the head of the Israeli delegation to the bilateral 
talks with Syria. Our first question was whether Rabinovich 
shared the assessment of American officials that some dramatic 
or rapid progress had been made in the Syrian-Israeli dialogue? 
  [Rabinovich] No, I do not think that we should create an 
impression of dramatic progress. I think that several important 
things happened during the secretary of state's last visit. 
There were also some slight disappointments. A window of 
opportunity has been opened -- the secretary of state is 
arriving in Europe in the middle of the month and he can easily 
fly to the Middle East. Since some degree of progress was 
nevertheless made in the last round of shuttle trips between 
Damascus and Jerusalem, I think that everyone -- the Syrians, 
Israelis, and also the Americans -- thought that this window of 
opportunity should be taken advantage of. However, this does 
not necessarily indicate any dramatic progress in the 
negotiations. 
  [Friedman] The term window of opportunity sounds like a very 
diplomatic expression to us. What is the size of this window 
and what opportunities can be seen through it? 
  [Rabinovich] This window has a time frame of several days 
and the opportunity lies in the very fact of the secretary's 
arrival. When Secretary of State Christopher was here last time, 
he knew he would be returning to Europe in the middle of May to 
discuss issues related to Bosnia. Therefore, a proposal to hold 
the next round of negotiations in the region in mid-May was 
already raised then. This indeed is happening. 
  [Friedman] You earlier spoke of the encouraging signs that 
the secretary of state discerned during his stay in Damascus. 
Perhaps you could tell us what those signs were? 
  [Rabinovich] The positive side of what took place during the 
secretary's last visit was that the Syrians for the first time 
came out with a comprehensive, detailed, and substantial 
reaction to all the components of our package. A reaction which 
was quite novel in some aspects. This is the positive side of 
things. The other two less positive facets are first and 
foremost the fact that the Syrians started off by adopting a 
tough negotiating position. There is a significant gap between 
the package we presented and the Syrian reaction. Second, the 
Syrians still refuse to relate to our proposals as a package. 
They still believe they can take the package's six components, 
extract those specific elements that are of interest to them -- 
such as the issue of withdrawal -- and focus exclusively on 
them. Our position was and remains that we are discussing a 
comprehensive package that must be treated as a whole. 
  [Friedman] Professor Rabinovich, you are still officially 
the head of the Syrian-Israeli bilateral committee which has not 
convened for a long time. Are we fated to be in a situation 
where any progress in the Syrian-Israeli track, in the event 
that such progress indeed takes place, can only be made when 
Secretary of State Christopher finds some free time on his 
agenda? 
  [Rabinovich] If one looks at the last nine months, the talks 
had a certain rhythm where momentum was created by the secretary 
of state's visits to the region or by the summit meeting between 
Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. This momentum could then be 
translated into limited progress at the Washington talks; 
progress which could then be exploited in turn during the next 
visit. This was the talks' rhythm. Since not enough momentum 
has accrued to justify another round of negotiations in 
Washington, the talks have not been convened. We all hope that 
the upcoming visit will effect sufficient progress to justify 
holding another round of talks in Washington which will prove 
fruitful and constructive. We do not want to hold an empty 
round of talks. 
  [Dan] Prof. Rabinovich, a headline on the front page of 
HA'ARETZ reports that Israel has asked for $5 billion from the 
United States as financial compensation for returning the Golan 
Heights. Can you confirm this report? 
  [Rabinovich] No, I do not think that we want to get into any 
details. Speculation is rampant; however, the discussion was 
held in a very limited forum and I think that it is both 
preferable and possible that work on such a hypothetical aid 
package be conducted quietly. One must remember that this whole 
matter is conditional on both parties actually reaching an 
agreement and beginning to implement its arrangements. 
Everything is hypothetical and it is too early to start 
discussing details. Even if the details appearing in various 
articles are not accurate, I would prefer not to comment on them. 
  [Friedman] We are left with a lot of speculation and very 
little information. Thank you, Professor Rabinovich.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben and 'Irit </F>
Rosenblum] 
  [Excerpts] Israel is asking the United States for $5 
billion special military aid as compensation for the security 
risks involved in the Golan Heights withdrawal. 
  The United States and Israel will set up working groups of 
experts to discuss the details of the Israeli aid request, it 
was reported in talks held during Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's recent visit to Israel. 
  The granting of the U.S. aid to Israel will require special 
legislation in congress. The Israeli aid request has two 
components: 
  1. The storing of more than $1.5 billion worth of arms and 
ammunition in emergency storehouses in Israel. The equipment 
will belong to the U.S. Armed Forces and will be guarded by 
them, but will be put at the service of the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] during wartime. 
  2. Providing the IDF with sophisticated arms and 
intelligence, some of it state-of-the-art, so far not supplied 
to Israel. 
  In addition, Israel wants U.S. aid to remain at the present 
level of $3 billion for some time. 
  The secretary of state will arrive mid-month for another 
round of shuttle diplomacy between Jerusalem and Damascus. 
  Israel wants clarifications about the Syrian peace proposal 
Christopher delivered a week ago. Senior political sources said 
that Israel's request for clarifications mainly concerns the 
security arrangements on the Golan and issues relating to the 
implementation of the arrangement in stages. They said that 
Israel rejects the Syrian demand for "symmetrical" security 
arrangements, and addresses questions to Syria on that issue. 
  Israel also wants to know what the Syrians mean when they 
talk about normalization within the framework of a peace 
settlement. Political sources in Israel said yesterday they 
believe that the chances of an imminent resumption of the 
Washington peace talks are very low and that the negotiations 
with Syria will be focused on Christopher's shuttle diplomacy in 
the near future. 
  Nevertheless, it is still unclear how long the secretary of 
state will have to invest in active mediation between Jerusalem 
and Damascus, and it appears that the formula for continued 
negotiations will be decided only after Christopher's upcoming 
visit and according to the progress that will be achieved in it.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said during his 
meeting yesterday with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
that if Japan wishes to have an impact on the Middle East 
political process, it should embrace a balanced policy and show 
greater involvement in Israeli affairs. 
  Rabin said the Russians have realized that if they wish to 
influence the peace process, they cannot hold biased views. 
"Having understood that, the Russians decided to adopt a 
balanced policy, which allows them to influence events," the 
prime minister said. 
  The prime minister said that Japanese-Israeli relations have 
known difficulties, and although a favorable change has taken 
place over the past few years, there is room for continuing 
improvement. He stressed the importance of increased Japanese 
investment in Israel, which cannot be only a market for Japanese 
products. "U.S.-based multinational companies, such as 
Motorola, Digital, and IBM, have invested in Israel," Rabin 
noted. 
  The prime minister stressed Israel's commitment to the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord, explaining that at 
the PLO's request, the withdrawal from Gaza will take longer 
than anticipated. He asked Japan to increase its involvement in 
the peace process, mainly by exploiting its ties in the Arab 
world. 
  The prime minister asked his guest to raise the issue of the 
Israeli MIA's and Israel's request for new information on this 
issue during his forthcoming meetings with President Hafiz 
al-Asad in Damascus. 
  The Japanese foreign minister said his country has pledged 
$200 million to the Palestinians over a two-year period. "Japan 
assists Jordan as well, and it is acting to convince Syria to 
join the multilateral talks," Kakizawa said. He added that 
Japan is committed to continued active participation in the 
multilateral process. Japan chairs the multilateral working 
group on environmental issues. 
  Kakizawa noted the developing Japan-Israel ties in the 
spheres of trade and scientific, technological, and cultural 
cooperation. He said his country is committed to action against 
the Arab boycott, and it misses no opportunity to pressure Arab 
countries to call off the boycott. [passage omitted] 
  The Japanese foreign minister surprised the prime minister 
by 
revealing that he had visited Israel in 1964. "My return after 
so many years reinforces the hope that we will see you in Japan 
as early as this year," Kakizawa said. Rabin accepted the 
invitation, explaining that his planned visit to Japan had been 
postponed due to developments in Israel. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has described the 
inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa as 
an international event, nay, even historic. As he was leaving 
for South Africa to take part in the inauguration ceremony, 
Buwayz clarified that Lebanon's relations with this country have 
been normal and natural since it eliminated racism. However, 
the application of this decision requires some time. We have 
this report from our colleague Darwish 'Ammar from Beirut 
airport: 
  [Begin recording] ['Ammar] Mr. Buwayz, you leave today for 
South Africa to take part in President Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration ceremony. What would you like to say on this 
occasion with regard to Lebanon's participation in this ceremony? 
  [Buwayz] Of course, the election and inauguration of 
President Mandela after the historic reforms in South Africa are 
considered an international, nay, even historic event. This is 
so because of the developments that have taken place there and 
also because of the effects of this development on the political 
and humanitarian level. By this I mean the cancellation of 
racial discrimination and openness toward democracy and freedom. 
There is no doubt that Lebanon should not stay away from this 
event. It should not be kept away from the significance of this 
event, both from the aspect of democracy, freedom, and 
coexistence, and from the aspect of the extensive historic and 
ancient Lebanese presence in South Africa, where there is a 
large Lebanese community. 
  Proceeding from this, the visit on this occasion acquires a 
special character. Therefore, Lebanon had to attend this 
international celebration. 
  ['Ammar] When will the Arab League's resolution on ending 
the boycott of South Africa come into effect in Lebanon? 
  [Buwayz] The resolution to cancel the boycott is a decision 
that was made in the Arab League during the last session over a 
month ago. The Lebanese Council of Ministers applied this 
resolution in the session before last by canceling all aspects 
of the political, economic, and trade boycott. Thus, relations 
now between Lebanon and South Africa are natural and very normal. 
  ['Ammar] Will there be diplomatic representation between the 
two countries? 
  [Buwayz] We now have a general consulate there. We have 
made the decision to normalize diplomatic relations. Of course, 
the implementation of this decision requires some material and 
financial support which might not be available immediately. 
  ['Ammar] On the sidelines of the visit to South Africa, will 
you hold meetings with the participants in the inauguration 
ceremony such as representatives of various countries taking 
part in the ceremony? 
  [Buwayz] As with every international meeting of this 
caliber, the celebration will include a large number of heads of 
state, prime ministers, and foreign ministers. This event might 
provide the opportunity for side meetings with some officials. 
  ['Ammar] During your stopover in Paris, will you hold talks 
and meetings in the French capital? 
  [Buwayz] No. Our stopover in Paris is purely mechanical. 
  ['Ammar] Mr. Minister, there are some rumors about a 
possibility of your visiting the United States. Will you be 
going to the United States? 
  [Buwayz] I was supposed to visit Florida in response to an 
invitation from the University of Florida to deliver a lecture 
on Lebanon and the peace process here. However, some events 
have made me change my plans. It has been postponed to an as 
yet unspecified date. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Badar Bakhus al-Fighali from Paris] </F>
  [Text] Western diplomatic sources have received a secret 
report indicating that the United States has donated $100 
million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). 
UNRWA will use this money to buy land in 'Akkar and northern 
al-Biqa' and build modern camps for Palestinian refugees to 
replace the camps destroyed during the Lebanese civil war and 
other camps which will be dismantled in the southern areas close 
to the Lebanese-Israeli border. 
  According to reliable sources within UNRWA, the U.S. plan, 
whose implementation has actually begun in Lebanon, aims to 
settle the Palestinians living in Lebanon since 1948 and for 
which there is no hope of returning to their original homes. 
  Diplomatic reports circulating in Paris last week indicated 
that Israel is trying to persuade Jordan to settle the 
Palestinian refugees in the Jordan Valley. This Israeli policy 
is incorporated in a booklet prepared by Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres containing his concept of the future of 
joint cooperation between Jordan and Israel. This booklet was 
scheduled to be distributed to the multilateral talks on water 
that were held in the Sultanate of Oman recently.

  [Text] Labor Minister 'Abdallah al-Amin and Deputy Dr. 
Ayyub Humayyid were invited by the Social and Cultural Club in 
al-Qusaybah yesterday evening to attend a seminar called 
"Lebanon Between Plan and Reaction." It was held at the 
al-Husayni Club in the town of al-Qusaybah in al-Nabatiyah. The 
seminar was attended by a member of the Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party's regional command, 'Ali Zayn Ghandur, who headed a 
delegation of the party's command in the south. The central 
labor representative of the Amal movement, Bassam Tulays, also 
attended, as did the members of Amal's command in the south; a 
delegation from the Syrian Social Nationalist Party; a number of 
officials; representatives from clubs and societies in the 
region; and the residents of the township. 
  Minister al-Amin delivered a lecture in which he discussed 
the Arab-Israeli negotiations that started with the Madrid 
conference. He explained the various stages of these 
negotiations. Minister al-Amin then discussed the U. S. 
position, which promised to play the role of (?honest) broker in 
the talks. But the Israeli stand insisted that there cannot be 
negotiations with all the Arabs, but rather with every Arab 
country separately. 
  Minister al-Amin added that President Hafiz al-Asad tried to 
rectify the situation by balancing out the negotiations after 
Yasir 'Arafat stepped out of the peace equation, took sides with 
Israel, and dealt Arab solidarity a blow in one of its most 
sensitive areas. The fact that 'Arafat stepped out of the peace 
process clearly weakened all the peace courses at every stage. 
In a public Israeli attempt to absorb the results of the Geneva 
summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, Israel 
started trying to abort the results of this summit. The summit 
had concluded with one very clear fact: that the solution needs 
to be comprehensive and include all the occupied Arab 
territories. In other words, Israel must withdraw from all the 
occupied territories so that we can progress one step forward 
toward peace and eventually toward comprehensive peace. 
  Yasir 'Arafat signed the agreement in Washington and does 
not 
have any idea what is awaiting the Palestinian people, added 
al-Amin. All that Yasir 'Arafat has gained is that Rabin, after 
a public appearance on TV, agreed to shake Yasir 'Arafat's hand 
after Clinton put pressure on him. During the second signing 
ceremony, the various stages of which we saw in the auditorium 
of the Conference Center in Cairo, a real theater piece was 
being acted out in front of us. This play has greatly harmed 
Palestinian and Arab dignity. Yasir 'Arafat, this great leader 
who compared himself to Mandela--the leader who has defeated the 
British Empire and realized independence for South Africa, all 
the rights for his people, and the world's recognition, as 
opposed to a dwarf called 'Arafat--has succeeded in acquiring an 
area of six square kms for the self-rule authority. This is the 
person who did not work in the interest of his own people who 
died in Lebanon. 
  Minister al-Amin added that Gaza and Jericho will not be 
able 
to absorb the mortal remains of the Palestinians. The Israelis 
have given 'Arafat cemeteries, not dignity or a state. This is 
one aspect of the negotiations. The other aspect which pertains 
to you in the south since you are suffering daily from the 
destruction and effects of the aggression, the Lebanese 
Government--that is the cabinet and the Chamber of 
Deputies--still clings to its previous stand which says that 
Resolution 425 is the basis for every solution. As regards the 
part on Lebanon which is outside the framework of Resolution 
425, no one can accept just any solution. If we find a solution 
that guarantees the dignity, security, freedom, sovereignty, and 
independence of our country other than Resolution 425, then we 
will abandon Resolution 425 and adopt this new resolution. But 
so far, we have not found anything that can guarantee the 
dignity, security, freedom, sovereignty, and independence of 
Lebanon other than Resolution 425. This is why we adhere to it. 
It is a clear text and has very clear articles and paragraphs. 
It is a text that stipulates the full, comprehensive, and 
unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Lebanese 
territories to the internationally acknowledged borders of 1949. 
Resolution 425 sets a mechanism for implementing this solution 
by sending the UN Interim Force in Lebanon to supervise the 
Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of the Lebanese Army in 
place of the withdrawing Israeli army. In the past, the 
Israelis along with the West in general and the Americans in 
particular have found the excuse that Lebanon, as a result of 
the civil war, lost its state, authority, and the Army and is 
not capable of implementing Resolution 425. In other words, 
there is yet no Army in Lebanon capable of implementing 
Resolution 425. 
  Minister al-Amin continues: Now the war has ended and there 
are no militias at all. If by militias they mean the 
Resistance, then we answer that the Resistance is not militias. 
It is Lebanon's peace-keeping force. It is the real peace 
force. The victory of the Resistance will undoubtedly be a 
victory for peace. The Resistance is not a militia nor does it 
have anything to do with militias.

  [Text] Commenting on the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement, 'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah said that 
the agreement was a victory for Israel, not the Palestinians. 
Israel, Fadlallah pointed out, polished its public image and 
got many doors open in the Arab World. Dazzled by the 
agreement, some Arabs are opening their doors to Israel and 
hastening to normalize relations with it even before the latter 
makes any overture. 
  Fadlallah added: The Arab world is under a spell. Israel is 
not offering the Arabs much. The enemy's prime minister told a 
Qatari newspaper: We want to be stronger than the Arabs so that 
the latter may understand that they cannot get anything from us 
except through negotiations. 
  This, Fadlallah said, means that America helped Israel 
militarily so as to force the Arabs to make concessions. 
America wanted to deprive the Arabs of any clout they may use 
against Israel. 
  Therefore, this agreement has no legitimacy. We believe that 
the nation should hold firm to its principles, because once we 
start making concessions we will never stop. We might even lose 
more land. 
  France once saw Algeria as French territory. America may 
come to see the Gulf as U.S. territory. We recently read that a 
U.S. official visited Yemen and no sooner was he gone than the 
war broke out there. We in Lebanon are used to such visits by 
U.S. officials, who are adept at playing a double game. This 
double game, long known to us in Lebanon, has just started in 
Yemen.

  [Excerpt] Hizballah has issued the following statement in 
response to the enemy's demands calling for striking at the 
Resistance forces in the south and in the occupied territories: 
  The conditions set by the enemy leaders and their demand to 
disarm the Resistance whether in the south or in the occupied 
territories reveal the extent of the enemy's concern over the 
effectiveness of the Resistance and its fighters in dealing 
blows to the enemy's security status and occupation presence. 
  Although the enemy's conditions reveal a blatant Zionist 
intransigence that is politically and militarily supported by 
the United States, they demonstrate the reality of the enemy's 
chaos and confusion. The Zionist leaders have been diligently 
trying to convince their settlers that they can play 
simultaneously the games of force, negotiation, and superiority 
under the slogan of security that is unshakable and invincible. 
  The statement adds: While these conditions demonstrate the 
increasing Zionist deadlock, the enemy might yet try to end this 
deadlock through the readiness of some parties to discuss these 
conditions, as happened in the case of the representatives of 
the Palestinian Islamic Resistance in Jordan. 
  The statement believes that the enemy's conditions are aimed 
at making the Arab countries play the role of police in 
defending its security without changing its policy of aggression. 
  The statement reiterates Hizballah's outright rejection of 
these conditions and calls for confronting them firmly and 
forcibly. The statement warns against suspicious voices that 
are trying to depict the recent confrontations in the south and 
the subsequent Zionist-Lahdist attacks as internal feuding and 
sectarian sedition. 
  The statement adds that the bombardment of Sidon and the 
atrocities against the inhabitants of 'Aramta represent a 
Zionist criminal act. The killing of some Lahdist agents by the 
Resistance men is only a link in the chain of the honorable 
national responsibilities and duties. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Hizballah considers the participation of an 
official Zionist delegation at a conference on water in Oman a 
grave and fatal step encouraging the enemy in its aggression and 
absolving it of its heinous crimes. 
  The party stressed that cooperation with the Zionist enemy 
"accelerates the collapse of the Arab bond and the common Arab 
concepts of security, economy, politics, and even culture and 
history." It warned that the Arabs will pay for this policy, as 
their dignity, rights, independence, economy, and identity will 
be violently crushed and confiscated by an enemy wearing the 
cloak of a cooperative friend. 
  In a statement, Hizballah viewed the participation of an 
official Zionist delegation at a water conference in Oman as a 
move within the context of the Arab regimes' failure to take a 
position concerning the boycott of Israel. 
  The statement said: "Showing readiness for cooperation with 
the Zionist enemy while it perpetrates the most horrible crimes 
against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples only encourages 
this enemy to continue its aggression and exonerates it for its 
heinous crimes. Oman's step is one of the wrong and fatal steps 
that some Arab regimes, urged and encouraged by the United 
States, began to take to bypass the facts and diktats of the 
historical conflict with the Zionists, to remove the evidence of 
the crime, and to open the region's doors to an onslaught of 
normalization that will subject all the region's capabilities to 
American and Zionist tutelage and domination. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, May 6 (AFP)--Southern forces fired six Scud 
long-range missiles at economic and civilian targets in Yemen's 
capital on Friday, but without causing damage or casualties, the 
northern General People's Congress (GPC) said. 
  A GPC spokesman, quoted by the official news agency SABA', 
said one of the missiles exploded near Sanaa international 
airport and another three in mountainous areas. It gave no 
location for the other two. 
  "These missiles caused only horror for children, women and 
the elderly," said the spokesman, warning that the southern 
forces of the Yemen Socialist Party would be tried for war 
crimes. 
  He denied earlier reports from the south that the 
presidential palace in Sanaa had been hit. 
  With Yemen's four-year-old union in peril, President 'Ali 
Abdallah Salih's GPC has said its troops are bearing down on the 
southern port city of Aden with the aim of capturing it. 
  The forces of Salih, a northerner, are locked in a bitter 
struggle with those of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a 
southerner, who was dismissed by parliament on Thursday night at 
the end of a first day of heavy fighting. 
  Southern officials said their planes had hit the 
presidential 
palace with missiles and set it ablaze.

<F P=106> [Statement by unidentified "military source" at the Defense </F>
Ministry and General Staff Command; date not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] With God's help and the resolve of men dedicated 
and faithful to the homeland and its unity and its democratic 
option, and thanks to the rallying of the masses of our people 
behind our valiant Armed Forces and security forces all over the 
homeland, the heroes of our valiant Armed Forces have continued 
to achieve victories, to besiege the elements of apostasy and 
secession, to inflict successive defeats on them, and to force 
them to surrender and to heed the people's will, their 
Constitutional institutions, and their national options of 
unity, democracy, and advancement. 
  Units of our valiant Armed Forces of the 8th Brigade of the 
Special Forces, the 56th Brigade, and the al-Wahdah Brigades 
have managed, thanks to God's grace and massive support from our 
masses in the Governorates of al-Bayda' and Abyan, to topple the 
last defensive fortifications in the region [word indistinct] 
and move across Mukayris in the direction of Abyan, where, at 
0230 yesterday [2330 GMT on 5 May], they joined the forces of 
the al-'Amaliqah Brigade in Abyan Governorate. Thus, these 
forces have reassembled and formed, together, a striking force 
in the hands of unity and constitutional legitimacy to inflict 
defeat on the forces of apostasy which have deviated from the 
popular will and consensus. At the same time, the heroes of the 
al-'Amaliqah forces continued to present valiant resistance to 
the ferocious, aggressive attack by the forces of treachery and 
treason. The al-'Amaliqah forces fought fierce battles and 
confronted an intensive sea and air offensive. During these 
battles, they destroyed four tanks and four armored cars and 
shot down four of the attacking aircraft of the forces of 
secession. 
  Large numbers of the attacking forces have surrendered and 
declared their defection to the al-'Amaliqah forces and their 
support for unity and constitutional legitimacy against 
secession. At the same time, the heroes of the 2d Armored 
Division in al-Rahah have waged violent, heroic, and fierce 
battles against the aggressor forces, which were dispatched by 
the elements of apostasy and secession from the al-'Anad and the 
'Abbud and al-Buzah Brigades, and forced them to retreat after 
they beat back numerous attacks and valiantly confronted the 
attacks by the enemy aircraft affiliated with the elements of 
apostasy, which have been carrying out extensive sorties to 
attack the heroes of the 2d Armored Brigade since the day before 
yesterday. Our heroes of the air defense forces downed three of 
the attacking enemy aircraft. 
  In another development, the al-Hamzah Camp Forces and the 3d 
Infantry Brigade are continuing their steady advancement to 
achieve their objectives and to pursue the rebelling 
secessionist elements and forces. In a cowardly and treacherous 
action, which reveals the extent of the hidden rancor and 
plotting, exposes the true nature of the evil and wicked 
intentions against the freedom and security and safety of the 
people, and which clearly shows the truth of that uncivilized 
project that developed in the minds of that criminal gang as a 
bloody project for killing, terror, sabotage, destruction, and 
enmity toward the homeland and people and their achievements, 
the leaders of the separatist, criminal gang, led by war 
criminal al-Bid and one of his traitorous henchmen, Haytham 
Qasim Tahir, carried out a cowardly missile raid on the valiant 
capital city of Sanaa, the capital of the unity state and the 
symbol of steadfastness and victory, targeting innocent 
citizens, civilians targets, and vital installations in it. 
However, God's will was lying in wait for their rancor and 
wickedness. Their treacherous missiles did not succeed, and 
some of them sustained damage in the air. 
  At 1345 [1045 GMT], the forces of treachery and treason 
indiscriminately fired five Scud missiles against the 
inhabitants of Sanaa and civilian installations in the city. 
Two of them landed but did not explode. The three others 
exploded. No significant damage occurred, except for spreading 
panic among children, the elderly, and women who were asleep at 
the time of the treacherous and cowardly attack. 
  The forces of rancor and rebellion also carried out similar 
missile raids on the valiant city of Ta'izz. However, these 
missiles failed to achieve their objectives, except for further 
frightening the peaceful residents of the city, which they 
deceitfully wanted to be the venue for signing the accord 
document. God has willed that this treacherous aggression be 
repulsed and the criminal killers be defeated after their true 
nature was exposed to the people and the world, and after the 
masks were removed from their ugly faces, which deceived no one 
other than their hateful persons and deluded loyalists. 
  As part of their hostile schemes and objective of escalating 
the comprehensive war and spreading sedition in the homeland, 
those forces launched air raids on the headquarters of security 
and the al-Mashari' camp area in the city of 'Ataq in Shabwah 
Governorate, targeting the lives of heroic security men in 
Shabwah and the lives of our innocent citizens, who confronted 
the forces of apostasy, secession, and repression with 
unparalleled valiance, forcing them to retreat. 
  The source added that the secessionist, rebellious forces of 
oppression and aggression will never escape just and urgent 
punishment as a result of all that has taken place, the 
bloodshed that they have caused, and their looting of public 
funds. They are marching down the road to suicide after they 
squandered the people's funds to purchase arms in order to 
maliciously kill the people, their children, and the personnel 
of their Armed and Security Forces. They want to destroy all 
the political, developmental, and democratic achievements that 
have been realized in the homeland throughout the march of the 
Yemeni 26 September and 14 October revolutions. At the same 
time, they pushed our people and their Armed Forces into the 
incinerator of death and destruction in a suicidal losing 
battle, during which they had their share of defeat, shame, and 
disgrace. 
  These criminals and slaughterers are pushing deceived, 
innocent people into the remaining military units to kill them 
and shed their blood in the battlefield against their brothers 
and comrades-in-arms without a clear objective or honorable 
purpose. Rather, the sole objective of that criminal, 
secessionist, oppressive gang is to enjoy peace, leisure, and 
safety after they evacuated their families and relatives abroad, 
looted public funds, sold the people's public facilities, 
collected huge amounts of money and put them in secret accounts 
in foreign banks. As for the down-trodden Yemeni people who are 
suffering from the crisis they have fabricated, whether in Aden, 
Ta'izz, Lahij, Hadhramaut, Sanaa, Abyan, Sa'dah, Shabwah, al- 
Hudaydah, al-Maharah, and elsewhere, their share has been death 
and destruction. 
  The source refuted the false allegations being reiterated by 
their trumpets. The source explained that what is being 
broadcast about the military situation calls for ridicule and 
disdain. In addition, it is meant to deceive foreign public 
opinion. As for the Yemenis, they are being kept abreast of all 
the facts. These allegations reflect the state of defeat, 
weakness, and the blind confusion within the gang of rebellion 
and crime as it prepares for packing up to flee abroad. 
  The source said it is ridiculous for this gang and its 
sources to continue to talk about missiles from their aircraft 
hitting the Presidential Palace when they know these are false 
claims, that citizens in these and other cities know this, and 
that those whom it is trying to convince outside the country do 
not believe it. The best proof of this is that it has continued 
to talk, until yesterday, about the steadfastness and fighting 
of the Ba Suhayb Forces in Dhamar, when the fighting with these 
troops was settled last Wednesday [4 May], less than three hours 
after they had ignited the fire of war at the behest of that 
secessionist gang, led by war criminal al-Bid and his 
secessionist clique. 
  Those troops surrendered to the forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy. In addition, the commander of the Ba 
Suhayb Camp, Colonel Thabit Muthanna Dawwas, half brother of war 
criminal Haytham Qasim Tahir, was captured two days ago by the 
forces of unity and legitimacy. He is being interrogated now, 
after igniting fighting and then leaving the personnel of his 
camp to confront the fire of battle and death. He fled less 
than one hour after he issued orders. We do not know what else 
the source can claim or brag about when it watched, along with 
the whole world, Colonel Dawwas on television yesterday, 
explaining the truth, speaking about the defeat inflicted on his 
troops and the catastrophe he caused. 
  As for talking about the steps taken by those units, which 
are under the control of the secessionist gang, it is a 
laughable matter that insults the people's intelligence and does 
not merit a reply because its falseness will be exposed by stark 
facts. Many facts will expose the delusion and deception 
practiced by the propaganda machine of the criminal secessionist 
gang, so our people and foreign public opinion will know how low 
this gang sinks in it lies. These elements think they are smart 
enough to fool people. But lies will eventually be exposed and 
stark facts will continue to refute falsehood and delusion. Our 
people realize this is a lying, criminal, and evil gang. It 
sustains defeats daily, because, by its arrogant false pride, it 
wanted to stand against the people's will, which springs from 
God's will. If God helps you, none can overcome you. [Koranic 
verse]

<F P=106> [Statement by "responsible military source" at the Defense </F>
Ministry and the General Staff Command on 8 May -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] In the last moments of the defeat of the suicidal 
forces of apostasy and secession and as a crazy expression of 
the hysteria of death and annihilation, the criminal forces 
fired a number of Scud missiles at Sanaa and areas of the Sanaa 
Governorate at 2310 [2010 GMT] yesterday, Saturday, targeting 
secure citizens and vital and strategic civilian installations. 
However, thanks to God, this fierce offensive of more than five 
missiles failed to inflict any losses; it only terrorized 
citizens in the areas where they landed. 
  In a related development, the military source stressed that 
the decision made by the dismissed Haytham Qasim Tahir in the 
name of the defense minister declaring a general mobilization 
and calling up the reserves is considered baseless and 
illegitimate because it was issued by someone who has lost every 
military and official authority. It is a decision that 
expresses adherence to the delusion of survival. It has been 
proven practically that his end as well as the end of all 
secessionist forces rebelling against the Constitutional 
legitimacy has approached and is, God willing, imminent. We are 
confident that those who deceived the officers, noncommissioned 
officers, and soldiers in our Armed Forces' units, over which 
they hold sway and which they sent to death, will not be able to 
mobilize civilians and those helped by circumstances to remain 
outside the military service. They survived and were [word 
indistinct] the savage plotting ordeal and were confident they 
will be away from it. 
  O Sons of our Armed Forces -- officers, noncommissioned 
officers, and soldiers of the military units under the pressure 
of the rebelling elements in the secessionist leaderships of the 
Socialist Party: We address this appeal to you and ask you not 
to obey the orders of the rebelling gangs among the adventurous 
and hegemonistic leaderships of the Socialist Party. We address 
to you a sincere brotherly appeal to join the forces defending 
unity and Constitutional legitimacy, which are the forces of all 
the people, and not the forces of a gang or party. In the same 
manner as they protected the people's gains and accomplishments, 
these forces are today very heroically, efficiently, and capably 
working to rid you of the domination and hegemony of the gangs 
of apostasy, secession and adventurism among the secessionist 
military gangs. We make the pledge of the free and loyal to you 
that you will find every concern to secure your life, preserve 
your dignity, and restore your military honor. The stand of the 
legitimate and Constitutional leadership, which is defending 
unity, along with the officers and soldiers of the 3d Brigade in 
'Imran, is sufficient evidence and cogent proof of the integrity 
and sincerity of the legitimate leadership in which we, as well 
as all Yemeni people, confide and consider their legitimate 
representative and the protector of all the Yemeni people's 
interests. 
  O sons of the Armed forces -- soldiers, noncommissioned 
officers, and officers of the units under the control of the 
military gangs in the Socialist Party: We demand that you not 
throw yourselves into the pit of an unfeasible bloody 
confrontation or suffer by standing with those outlawed gangs 
that broke away from law, Constitutional legitimacy, and unity. 
Let us say enough of fighting, suicide, destruction, and 
bloodshed. We call on you to join the ranks of Constitutional 
legitimacy. You will receive all care and attention from a 
loving and compassionate brother. This is a guarantee and a 
free promise in the name of the people and before Arab and world 
public.

  [Text] Doha, May 7 (AFP) -- Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salih Basindwah called on southern leaders to surrender 
Saturday [7 May] saying northern forces had the upper hand as 
fighting raged near Aden. 
  Basindwah, a northerner, told Qatar's state-run radio that 
southern forces loyal to Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid had 
fired 13 Scud missiles at the capital Sanaa since fighting 
erupted on Thursday. 
  But he said northern forces backing President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih still had the advantage, saying 12 southern al-Bid 
warplanes had been shot down since Thursday. 
  "The military situation is not developing in the favour" of 
southern leaders he said, calling on them to "turn themselves in 
immediately", pledging that they would receive "a fair trial." 
  "Fierce fighting is raging near Aden," the main southern 
port- city, "between the (northern) army and the rebels", 
Basindwah said in a reference to al-Bid's forces. 
  He added that Aden was under a northern blockade to "force 
the outlaws to surrender." 
  Diplomats in Yemen said that a large concentration of 
northern troops was seen 50 kilometres (35 miles) north of Aden. 
  Meanwhile Basindwah said the situation in Sanaa and all the 
northern provinces was "calm." 
  He also said northern Yemenis were opposed to an emergency 
meeting of the Arab League to discuss the spiralling civil war 
as it was an "internal affair." 
  His comments came just before the Arab League was due to 
hold 
an emergency meeting in Cairo to discuss an Egyptian proposal to 
send a peacekeeping force to Yemen.

  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
A responsible military source at the Defense Ministry and the 
General Staff Command has stated the following: 
  For the fourth day, the heroes of our valiant Armed Forces, 
the forces of the people, unity, and Constitutional legitimacy, 
and protectors of democracy, have continued their splendid 
victories in all fields of confrontation with the forces of evil 
and rebellion against legitimacy and disavowal of the people and 
unity. They draw success from God, supporter of the brave 
soldiers who are loyal to their people, homeland, and unity. 
  At 1300 yesterday, the 2d Armored Brigade managed to advance 
and join the al-'Amaliqah Brigade to form a heroic combat bridge 
toward the attainment of the main objectives in the last chapter 
of the battle for unity and democracy. They are now confidently 
advancing, supported by the 13th and 56th Brigades and the 
al-Wahdah Brigades in the direction of Aden Governorate. They 
are confronting the desperate and defeatist remnants of the 
secessionist gang forces. 
  These forces are currently waging brave battles in the 
al-'Alam area, 20 km from the beloved economic and commercial 
capital, Aden, approaching the last dens of the gang of plotting 
and secession in the Socialist Party leadership. 
  These forces managed to besiege the misguided elements of 
the 
Shamsan Brigade. A large number of the brigade's officers and 
soldiers surrendered and their weapons, equipment, and vehicles 
were captured. 
  In the Lahij Governorate, the 6th al-Wahdah [Unity] Brigade 
and the 2d Independent Armored Brigade waged heroic and brave 
battles during which they managed to destroy the (?retreating) 
units of the 'Abbud Brigade and the secessionist gang militias. 
More than 40 troops and 200 militiamen surrendered and joined 
the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. 
  In Abyan Governorate, and in an effort to fortify our Armed 
Forces in this patient, glorious governorate, the heroic 
al-Wahdah Brigades -- infantry, artillery, and armor -- managed 
to destroy the 30th Brigade, which was recently moved from 
al-Maharrah Governorate to besiege and attack the al-'Amaliqah 
forces. Thus, this brigade met the dark destiny to which it was 
pushed by the gang of rebellion and secession. All of its 
commanders, officers, and soldiers surrendered to the forces of 
legitimacy and the Constitution, the protectors of democracy. 
All weapons, equipment, and vehicles, which are kept by the 
elements of that rebelling gang for plotting in the Abyan 
Governorate, were captured. 
  Our Armed Forces in the southwestern axis of the 3d Infantry 
Brigade and units from the Khalid Camp and the Reserve Brigade 
continued to carry out their fixed missions and achieve 
successive victories while continuing their advance toward the 
al-'Anad Camp and the capital of Lahij Governorate. 
  While these decisive battles are positively progressing, 
the Air Force within our valiant Armed Forces assumed a heroic, 
unique, and brave commando role in confronting the attackers' 
aircraft and completing the missions and targets they had been 
assigned on all battlefronts with high efficiency. They carried 
out more than 20 air sorties, fulfilling their objectives with 
complete success. 
  The following are among the most important military tasks 
they successfully carried out: Destroying the runways and 
facilities of the al-'Anad airport, destroying and sinking a 
missile gunboat which tried to shell our armed forces in Abyan 
Governorate, destroying large quantities of the military 
hardware of the 30th Infantry Brigade while it was advancing to 
(Lubyan) Directorate in Abyan Governorate. They also succeeded 
in hitting and destroying the Aden airport runway so the rebel 
secessionist clique will not be able to use it to pursue the 
aggression against our Armed Forces, or to escape outside the 
country. 
  While the comprehensive bloody war that was arranged by the 
rebel and secessionist forces is nearing its end, their rancor 
excacerbates and their bloody and terrorist actions intensify. 
The secessionist gang fired missiles on populated areas in 
al-Rahibah, Ta'izz Governorate, and al-Mukha, targetting the 
power plant, and against Al-Hudaydah, targetting the power plant 
in the Ra's Kabir area. Many defenseless citizens were 
martyred, although these missiles failed to destroy the vital 
installations they had as targets. The rancorous will swallow 
their rancor. 
  Within the unique and brave operations that the forces of 
unity and legitimacy have carried out, our air defense forces 
confronted with great ability the enemy aircraft on all fronts, 
downing one aircraft over Abyan, another over Ka'kaba, and a 
third over Ta'izz Governorate. 
  The military source concluded his statement by saying: There 
is no need today to rebutt the media falsehoods and lies by the 
defeatist secessionist forces of the YSP command because their 
lies speak for themselves and are refuted by the stable security 
state of affairs in all cities, where the rancorous have tried 
to ignite the sedition, to destroy, and harm their citizens. 
  The source praised the confidence all the sons of the Yemeni 
people have demonstrated toward the victories their Armed Forces 
and Public Security Forces are scoring, their pride in them, and 
their waiting for the important victory over all the forces of 
oppression, apostasy, and secession so that the new history of 
our people and country will put an end to the last page of their 
rancorous and desperate conspiracy in spite of the military 
hardare and lethal weapons the rancorous and conspirators had 
prepared and which they purchased with money that was to be used 
to feed the people and at the expense of the people's 
development aspitations for progress and construction. They now 
are receiving the just punishment. History has discarded them, 
away from our people's lives, so they may not sully their 
unionist and democractic march and so that they may not tarnish 
the ray of hope in all the hearts of the Yemenis. Fighting is 
prescribed for you, and you dislike it. But it is possible that 
you dislike a thing which is good for you. [Koranic verse]

  [Text] Dubai, United Arab Emirates, May 8 (AFP) -- Troops 
loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Sunday captured the 
south's main military airport, 50 kilometres from the port city 
of Aden, Western diplomatic sources said. 
  The sources in the region said Al-'Anad was the only 
military 
airport around the southern stronghold of Aden, although the 
south has a second base in the Hadhramaut, 700 kilometres (420 
miles) to the east. 
  The northern forces have the port city trapped in a "pincer 
movement," one diplomat said.

  [Text] An official spokesman of the Defense Ministry in 
Aden has denied foreign media reports today that fierce battles 
were fought about 20 km north of Aden. In a statement to the 
YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, SABA'', the spokesman went on to say that 
the foreign media reports on the fall of al-Anad Air Base to the 
secessionist forces of the al-Ahmar family are totally untrue. 
He said the air base in the al-Anad area is discharging its 
normal national functions in providing support to the forces of 
unity and democracy, which are striking successive blows against 
the secessionist al-Ahmar forces. 
  He stressed that Lahij Governorate is entirely under the 
control of the forces of unity and democracy, and that al-Anad 
Air Base is situated in that governorate. Concluding his 
statement, the Defense Ministry's official spokesman hailed the 
heroic and principled role of the forces of democracy and unity 
in pursuing the forces of treason and secession in the depths of 
[word indistinct].

  [Text] SANAA, May 8 (AFP) - The battle for Aden reached the 
gates of the southern stronghold on Sunday [8 May] and the city 
was expected to fall under northern control within hours, the 
official Yemeni news agency SABA'' said. 
  "Violent clashes are now taking place at the gates of the 
city between government forces and rebel troops," said SABA'', 
which is run by the northern administration loyal to President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  "Aden is expected to fall within hours," under a barrage of 
tankfire and artillery, it said, reporting fires had broken out 
around the city. 
  SABA'' said a southern brigade had been destroyed in Abyan 
province near Aden and two of the south's warplanes shot down as 
the north seized control of al-Dhalih, a town 60 kilometrers (25 
miles) north of the port city. 
  Despite the northern reports of military success, the 
situation in Aden itself was still calm, according to an AFP 
correspondent in the city of more than 500,000 residents. 
  Diplomats in the region, meanwhile, said the north had 
trapped Aden in a "pincer movement" and captured the south's 
main air base. 
  But the south said it repelled northern forces in al-Kawt, 
30 
kilometres (18 miles) to the east of Aden and that Salih's 
troops were in retreat toward the mountains. 
  Other northern elements had been ambushed and wiped out in 
Radfan, to the north, said military spokesmen in Aden, the power 
base of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the president's bitter 
rival.

  [Text] Forces loyal to unity and national alignment 
succeeded yesterday morning in storming the camp of the 2d 
Armored Brigade at (al-Rahah), in the governorate of Lahij, 
following repeated loudspeaker appeals from members of the Armed 
Forces. They warned their brothers in the camp of the 
consequences of being dragged into this war, which the 
adventurers want to use to defend their flimsy, collapsing rule. 
Hundreds of 2d Armored Brigade soldiers surrendered, and 
announced they were joining the ranks of the people defending 
unity and democracy. The camp was seized after a small remnant 
of fighters fled. These persons had pledged themselves to evil, 
and to defending the regime of the military family ruling in 
Sanaa. 
  During the attack on the camp, appeals were made to the 
fighters and citizens to preserve the lives of their brothers, 
and to preserve the those possessions of the 2d Brigade which 
were left in the camp after its members had fled. All these 
possessions are now with the Yemeni Armed Forces. 
  After entering and touring the camp, the fighters and 
citizens were surprised by the fortified defenses set up by the 
brigade, in accordance with instructions from the military 
family ruling in Sanaa, which displayed the absolutely divisive 
mentality with which it views Yemeni unity. The family was 
under the illusion that the brigade and its fighters were in a 
hostile zone. This exposes the premeditated intentions for war 
this tyrannical gang held. Had it not been hostile intentions 
which motivated them, simple defenses would have been sufficient 
in a permanent military zone -- like the ones set up by units 
transferred from Aden to Sanaa. 
  Immediate instructions were issued by the Defense Ministry 
following the storming of the camp, which called on the soldiers 
and citizens to preserve the lives of their fighting brothers, 
and to reassure those who had fled to the mountains that they 
were in their homeland and among their brothers. All military 
efforts should be directed against the hearts of the al-Ahmar 
gang and its clique.

  [Text] A responsible source has denied foreign media 
reports, which quote the ASSOCIATED PRESS, that the forces of 
the oppressive gang of al-Ahmar have reached the al-Alam area, 
30 km from the outskirts of Aden. The source said these claims 
were totally untrue. They were the product of the delusory 
imaginings of the military gang of the [word indistinct] 
al-Ahmar gang, who had succeeded in feeding these false reports 
to obfuscate the great defeats inflicted on their forces in 
Abyan, Qa'tabah, Radfan, and Kirsh. The source said that the 
remnants of the Amaliqah forces, which had claimed to have been 
on the outskirts of Aden, are now scattered on the al-Arqub 
after our heroic armed forces destroyed their main strongholds 
in Zinjibar and Ja'ar. At dawn today our forces succeeded in 
destroying the camp of the Amaliqah at Zinjibar completely, 
burning all stores, supplies, and ammunition. They destroyed a 
major portion of the Amaliqah vehicles and then pursued the 
remnants of the force, which fled in the direction of al-Arqub. 
  The forces of the 30th Brigade, now deployed in their new 
positions along the Lawdar-Mukayras axis, were able to join up 
with the 20th Brigade in Mukayras this morning. 
  As for the military situation in Lahij, the 2d Armored 
Brigade, which had been loyal to the bloody and oppressive 
al-Ahmar gang, was successfully destroyed. The camp at Lahij 
was captured. Many officers and other ranks were taken 
prisoner, and some tanks and military vehicles were captured. 
Most of them had been destroyed during the fighting in al-Rahah 
in Radfan over the past few days. The defeat of the 2d Armored 
Brigade made it possible to open the road between al-Dali and 
Aden, and for our armed forces stationed at Radfan and al-Anad 
to join up with the Abbud Brigade at al-Dali. The latter was 
provided with supplies after it firmly withstood, with 
exceptional heroism, an attack mounted on it by three brigades 
from the al-Hamzah Camp, central security forces, and Republican 
Guards from the Qa'tabah-ibb axis, in the heroic town of 
al-Dali. The inhabitants of al-Dali had been subjected to a 
mindless and indiscriminate artillery bombardment which lasted 
an hour a day over three successive days. 
  The ground battles resulted in the destruction of tens of 
tanks belonging to the security three force -- loyal to the 
bloody al- Ahmar gang -- which attacked the town of al-Dali, but 
their tanks and military vehicles were overcome and are lying on 
the battlefield. The steadfast forces of the Abbud Brigade were 
able to capture the positions of the attacking forces in the 
[word indistinct] area of the town of Qa'tabah. The battles on 
the al- Dali and Radfan fronts resulted in the failure of an 
attack mounted by the 3d Brigade, from their positions in the 
town of Taiizz, toward Kirsh. The attacking tank squadron was 
destroyed, and many officers and other ranks were captured with 
their arms and equipment by the (Dabuzah) Brigade, which is 
deployed at Kirsh.

  [Text] The forces of unity, democracy and national concord 
have destroyed large units of the Amaliqah [northern forces], 
along with their stores, in al-Hawsh and Zinjibar, as well as 
the strongholds of the Amaliqah in many parts of Abyan 
Governorate. They have succeeded in wiping out many of the 
Amaliqah advance units. 
  In a statement for the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, SABA'', a 
military 
source said that our heroic armed forces had succeeded in 
destroying the strongholds of the Amaliqah and overrunning their 
forward positions east of Zinjibar with helicopters and 
artillery, which participated in a concerted attack against the 
fortifications and stores of the Amaliqah, completely destroying 
them. The source said the forces of the 30th Brigade and the 
Unity Brigade had occupied the positions of advance units in 
Lawdar, Mudiyah and Shuqrah, where the attacking Amaliqah found 
themselves under sustained attack from the forces of the 30th 
Brigade, the Unity Brigade, and the Navy. The forces of national 
alignment were able to penerate the defenses of the Amaliqah and 
cut their communications, leaving them without central direction. 
  Meanwhile, other information indicates that the Amaliqah 
tried to retreat at Zinjibar, Lawdar, and Mudiyah with [word 
indistinct] the resident civilian population [words indistinct] 
children caused by this invasion by the Amaliqah of peaceful 
homes [words indistinct] the attacks of the patriotic forces. 
  Military clashes and confrontations continue up to this 
moment in various parts of Zinjibar, Lawdar, Mudiyah, and 
anywhere the remnants of the defeated Amaliqah forces remain. 
In the meantime, the masses of our struggling peoples are 
linking up with soldiers in the Radfan area and with our valiant 
fighters and forces from the al-Dali front, after our forces 
succeeded in destroying the 8th Armored Brigade in Radfan, 
capturing its camp at al-Rahah and pursuing its forces, which 
are scattering in all directions.

<F P=106> [Statement by "official spokesman" at the Ministry of </F>
Defense and the General Staff Command; date not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] Supported by God the almighty, and our dignified 
Yemeni people's cohesion with their leadership and Armed Forces, 
and with the heroism of the brave and faithful men in the Armed 
and Security Forces, the daily and decisive successes of the 
free popular will are continuing to defend unity and democracy 
and safeguard the Republic of Yemen by confronting the forces of 
apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party. Fierce 
battles are going on in the governorates of Lahij and Aden, 
close to the economic capital. At the same time, heroic 
resistance is taking place against the aggression on land, by 
sea, and in the air in the Abyan Governorate, where the Armed 
Forces secured absolute control the day before yesterday. 
  In the Aden Governorate, the al-'Amaliqah Brigade and the 2d 
Armored Brigade, along with the 2d al-Sa'iqah Brigade and the 
56th Brigade, are continuing their advance and confronting the 
remnants of the forces of the secessionist, rebellious gangs 
entrenched in the east and north of the governorate, engaging 
them capably and bravely, positively absorbing all attacks and 
wearing out the aggression forces. 
  The 2d Armored Brigade also managed to storm the defenses of 
the first and second lines of the forces deployed in the 
al-Dali' District, held by the forces of apostasy and secession, 
and seized large quantities of their weapons and military 
equipment, which were [word indistinct] by the secessionist 
forces that held sway in the Yemeni Socialist Party in secret 
depots and hideouts in this district to guard against their 
implementing their aggressive goals and their special designs. 
A large number of the forces that were positioned in that 
district joined the forces of Yemeni unity and constitutional 
legitimacy. A substantial amount of the ammunition and combat 
equipment was also destroyed. The land-based anti- aircraft 
guns managed to down an aircraft of the secessionist gang in the 
al-Dali' district this morning. 
  In the meantime, the Air Force of Yemeni unity and 
constitutional legitimacy continues its attacks on the dens of 
apostasy and secession, completing its combat missions and [word 
instinct] the secessionist gang with complete collapse. Our 
aircraft returned safely to base, having accomplished their set 
missions. The fighters of the units stationed in the southern 
sector succeeded in storming the defenses of the first line of 
the [name indistinct] Brigade, that was misguided by the 
mutinous secessionist gang, inflicting on it heavy losses. The 
heroes of the brigades of al- Wahdah, the infantry, the 
artillery, and the armory executed the missions to which they 
had been entrusted with efficiency and high combat ability in 
the [name indistinct] district. 
  The source described as baseless the reports propagated by 
the false separatist media and certain radio stations that Sanaa 
was the target of air raids this morning, adding that the 
objective of the statements and reports of the separatist 
rebellious gang on this and other nonexistent battles waged by 
units that were destroyed, units that surrendered, and units 
that joined the legitimacy and announced their loyalty to this 
legitimacy is to obscure the facts. These units are today 
receiving instructions from the higher political and military 
leadership represented by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and 
supreme commander of the Armed Forces. 
  All the lies of the forces of apostasy and secession are 
aimed at deluding external public opinion into believing that 
they still exist in order to repeat their falsehood and lies, 
which are rejected by the facts on the ground and by the 
victories [words indistinct] the epic of great victory for 
unity, democracy, and entrenching constitutional legitimacy. 
There is also the victory of wellbeing and justice in the 
battle of life in which every citizen is participating with his 
heart, mind, and solidarity. For the officers and 
noncommissioned officers, this battle is greater than all else 
because it is the battle of the sacred defense of life, 
principles, doctrine, and the gains of homeland and people. In 
this battle, they are confronting all challenges of conspiracy, 
death, and fragmentation that the despotic elements of apostasy 
are [word indistinct] until they were defeated, or will be 
defeated soon. 
  What affirms their frustration and failure is the fact that 
-- thanks to God's care -- all the [name of missiles indistinct] 
and Scud missiles, which these criminal forces fired last 
Thursday [5 May] on [words indistinct] vital and strategic 
facilities, failed (?to reach their targets) or to inflict any 
losses in the areas in which they fell. Some of them were even 
damaged in the air. 
  We reiterate the appeal to the brother officers, 
noncommissioned officers, and soldiers in the military units 
under the control of the separatist clique to wake up and to 
free themselves from the dictatorship of the dominating elements 
in the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] to save their lives, because 
they will not be above the law or stronger than the anger of the 
people against their enemies [words indistinct] the enemies of 
unity, freedom, and democracy, because our valiant Armed Forces, 
which offered severe sacrifices, are determined to destroy all 
dens of treason and separatists one after another. Success 
comes from God. 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If you 
will aid the cause of God, he will aid you and plant your feet 
firmly.

  [Text] Mr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, 
yesterday had a telephone call with Dr. Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, the 
Arab League secretary general. During this call they reviewed 
the development of the situation in the Yemeni arena. The prime 
minister praised the Arab League's efforts to overcome the grave 
developments as a result of the military outbreak of the 
situation, which began with the attack on the 5th Brigade in 
Harf Sufyan, the 3d Brigade in 'Imran, Ba Suhayb Brigade in 
Dhamar, and later by launching the all-out war against our 
Yemeni people by the bloody secessionist al al-Ahmar dynasty 
with a view to undermining the covention document.

  [Text] The Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, had a 
telephone call with Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, the Jordanian 
prime minister. He informed al-Majali about the latest 
developments in the Yemen arena and the all-out war launched by 
the al-Ahmar dynasty against our Yemeni people. 
  For his part, al-Majali affirmed that Jordan is keen about 
stopping the bloodshed and indicated that Jordan will act with 
other Arab countries in this direction. 
  It was learned by SABA'' news agency that Mr. Haydar 
Abu-Bakr 
al- 'Attas had a telephone call with the U.S. State Department, 
and this was followed by a meeting between our ambassador in 
Washington with the officials in the U.S. Department. 
  It was also learned by SABA'' news agency that the prime 
minister is continuing his contacts with other Arab and friendly 
countries. SABA' news agency said that the prime minister has 
drawn the attention of the directions [as heard] with which he 
made the calls to the dangers of the war launched by the 
al-Ahmar dynasty, which had concentrated their strikes against 
the civil and vital installations which affect the Yemeni 
people's lives and confirmed its envy and insistence to 
undermine all achievements. 
  The prime minister praised the steadfastness of the soldiers 
and officers of our Armed Forces and all our Yemeni masses which 
are repelling the conspiracy of the al-Ahmar house. He also 
praised the stand of the officers and soldiers who refused the 
orders and instructions which were issued by the al-Ahmar house 
and returned to the tribes which oppose the war and al-Ahmar 
house's instructions. 
  The prime minister, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, praised the 
stand of the government and the Defense Ministry to secure the 
rights of this [word indistinct] and expressed his pride of the 
heroic stands of the Yemeni tribes which reject the war and 
support the convention document.

  [Text] Dubai, United Arab Emirates, May 6 (AFP)--The 
southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) called for a ceasefire on 
Friday to halt its two-day-old civil war against the northern 
forces of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Aden Radio said. 
  The radio, monitored by Gulf news agencies, said the YSP 
based in the southern port city of Aden "accepts a ceasefire in 
response to calls from Arab and foreign countries." 
  "This favourable response is dictated by the interests of 
the 
Yemeni people, whose lives, belongings, unity, armed forces and 
economic installations must be preserved," the radio said, 
quoting a YSP statement.

  [Text] Sanaa has rejected the dispatch of Arab forces to 
stop the war in Yemen, saying that what is happening in Yemen is 
a domestic affair and could be decided internally, according to 
sources of the General People's Congress, which is led by 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  Salih dismissed the Yemeni oil minister and the Aden 
governor, both of whom belong to the Yemeni Socialist Party led 
by 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  Our correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit reported a short time ago 
that south Yemeni fighter planes staged several raids tonight on 
Sanaa. Six Scud missiles fell on the city during the day while 2 
northern planes raided Aden. The northerners have announced 
that they are preparing to launch an attack on Aden on several 
fronts.

<F P=106> [Talk carried within the "Issues and Events" program] </F>
  [Text] Brothers and sisters: We say that what is taking 
place in our country is an internal matter and that it needs no 
mediation from any side because the forces of apostasy and 
secession have ignited an all-out war in our homeland. They, 
therefore, are considered rebels against the constitutional 
legitimacy around which the people are rallying and which they 
freely chose. 
  We want to explain here that we appreciate the interest and 
sympathy of brothers and friends. We also want to make it clear 
that there is no longer any excuse for mediation. Also, the 
forces of apostasy and secession are on the verge of surrender 
and they will be taken into account for their acts. This matter 
is known by everybody. The armed units that receive orders from 
al-Bid and his clique, which dominates the [Yemeni] Socialist 
Party, are collapsing one after other. Many of these units' 
officers and personnel have surrendered now that they have 
become aware of the objectives of those who misled them. The 
door is open before the other units to join the units that are 
defending unity and chasing those rebelling against 
constitutional legitimacy. 
  We want also to say that through their calls for mediation 
the leaders of apostasy and separation want another opportunity 
to continue their game of undermining Yemen's unity. This is 
rejected by the legitimate leadership, which was patient for a 
long time and tried to achieve reconciliation with the gang of 
apostasy, separation, and evil, but to no avail. 
  Since the gang of apostasy and separation has not desisted 
from its path and is not aware of the pains caused by its 
practices, the only way is to apply the law on the criminals who 
worked to drive a wedge among the people, ignite the fire of 
sedition, and launch a all-out war [words indistinct] units of 
our Armed Forces, which they deceived, to fight the units 
defending unity and constitutional legitimacy. 
  What, then, is the meaning of the talk about mediation? In 
the past, the gang of apostasy and secession resorted to 
maneuvering and procrastination in the face of mediation. It 
used to ridicule the mediators and the legitimate leadership in 
order to evade all agreements. Arab brothers and friends became 
aware of this fact and knew full well the practices and twisted 
methods of the gang of apostasy and secession, which is 
considered -- in accordance with the Constitution, law, and 
reason -- a rebellious clique. It even committed crimes of high 
treason. It ignored national constants, called for 
estrangement, and worked to destroy unity. It tampered with 
public funds, shook security, and undermined the stability of 
the whole Yemeni people. 
  After long patience and indulgence, can we ignore all this 
and accept any mediation just so that the gang of apostasy can 
regain its breath and prepare to replace the scenario of this 
war, which it ignited, with a scenario of another war? 
  Our country -- leadership and people -- are awaiting the 
natural end of the gang of apostasy and secession that aimed at 
spreading bloodshed throughout the homeland and which is still 
dreaming of spreading a civil war in the streets. [words 
indistinct] know that there is no civil [word indistinct] at 
all. What is taking place are military operations aimed at 
subjugating the party rebelling against constitutional 
legitimacy, the party that seeks (?separation) and bloodshed.

  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the deputy chairman of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] Central Committee, has confirmed that the 
Yemeni people will successfully pass through this test of unity 
and democracy, just as they did the test of the September and 
October revolutions. 
  He explained during a news conference that the Yemeni people 
are strong because of the cause they support, and that no matter 
how much the secessionist al-Ahmar gang tries to fabricate 
issues, militarize the crisis, and derail the homeland, the 
political forces and national consensus will remain on the 
correct path which we all chose on 20 February. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: Man is Yemen's foundation. 
Hence, our strength lies with men and with those causes which 
men support. Random missile and cannon fire do not amount to 
any kind of strength, and they will not prevent the masses from 
raising their heads proudly and refusing to yield to the wishes 
and sicknesses of domineering gangs. We are stronger, our 
people are stronger -- we shall not abandon the march on the 
path that we chose -- the path of unity and democracy, the path 
of stability. 
  The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential Council and 
secretary general of the YSP pointed out in the course of his 
speech that the party had sacrificed much on behalf of the 
people. It had confronted the evil gangs so that they would not 
plunge the country into conflict. He pointed out that these 
concessions to the evil gangs have now been exhausted, and that 
the YSP stands united with the people. He confirmed that the 
situation is getting better. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid pondered what might be happening 
in 
Sanaa and many other areas, pointing out that the northern gangs 
have cut off communications both inside and outside the country 
so that people cannot communicate. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid stated that our legitimacy is 
derived from the people, and that the legitimacy of the media, 
which is being imposed on the people, is transient. He said 
that this legitimacy will only last for a couple of days, and he 
doubted the ability of some people to impose it for thirty days. 
  He emphasized the importance of cohesion to the internal 
front and to the nationalist forces, and stressed commitment to 
the processes of unity, democracy, multipartyism, and 
nondiscrimination between the citizens, wherever they live in 
any governorate. Whoever supports the pledge and accord 
document, national cohesion, and peaceful, democratic struggle, 
is with us in any governorate. The deputy chairman of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the YSP explained 
that instructions have been given for opening a camp in Lahj 
Governorate for whoever wants to join the ranks of unity and 
democracy. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid denied reports being disseminated 
by the hostile media on the strike against the Dhamar 
electricity station. He pointed out that the Republican Guard 
in Dhamar carried out this act. He emphasized that the forces 
of unity and democracy did not and will not hit any vital 
targets, since these belong to the people. But the forces of 
unity and democracy will search for the gang and its palaces, 
hideouts, and nests.

  [Text] The central committee of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] issued a statement on the exceptional joint meeting of the 
central committee of the YSP and the party's parliamentary bloc, 
held under the chairmanship of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice 
chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of 
the YSP. 
  The statement said that the meeting first heard the 
secretary 
general, who reviewed the current situation in the country and 
the state of belligerency ignited by al-Ahmar gang in all parts 
of Yemen after striking the 5th Brigade in Harf Sufyan, the 3d 
Brigade in 'Imran, and the attack on the Ba Suhayb Camp last 
Wednesday [4 May]. The statement affirmed that these attacks 
were carried out in accordance with the war decision taken by 
'Ali Abdallah Salih in order to bury the democracy, and [he] 
announced in his speech the war decision, which put the country 
in an endless disaster after having maneuvered about the 
convention document. The war had been paved by the series of 
murders and massacres of the Armed Forces of the unity, and all 
this means that 'Ali Abdallah Salih and his gang had looked at 
the unity as laying down his influence on the land of his 
authority by using various pawns of power. 
  The statement said that the war carried out by al-Ahmar 
house 
usually interprets their rejection of the unity and their 
insistance on carrying out their separationist project. This 
gang miscalculated when it did not take into account that the 
unity had become a reality and that the unity has had its own 
defenders. The socialist party and all patriots and honorable 
people will defend the country and the unity, and continue its 
sacrifices to defend the homeland and its unity. 
  The statement warns that the shelling of the civil 
establishments and economic corporations and villages and the 
killing of innocent people is a desperate attempt to justify the 
war and its crimes. By declaring a state of emergency, 'Ali 
Abdallah Salih has slain democracy and rejected all Arab and 
international efforts to stop bloodshed. This has been expected 
from 'Ali Abdallah Salih, who rejected the national consensus 
and the document. 
  The statement added that the central committee declares its 
rejection of the state of emergency and the use of the House of 
Deputies to cover up the war. The central committee at the same 
time condemns the declaration of the war by 'Ali Abdallah Salih, 
and appeals to all the masses and the Armed Forces to repel this 
conspiracy. It praises the heroship of the Armed Forces of the 
unity and the masses for their resistance of the aggression. 
  The central committee welcomed the Arab and the 
international 
calls to stop the war and continue the political and serious 
dialogue.

  [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, deputy chairman of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP], received two telephone calls yesterday 
afternoon from his brothers, Egyptian President Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak and Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan al Nuhayyan, the president 
of the United Arab Emirates. President Muhammad Husni Mubarak 
and Shaykh Zayid expressed their great concern over the 
situation in Yemen and the continued fighting there. They 
stressed their strongest determination to continue making all 
possible efforts to stop the fighting between the sons of the 
united Yemen. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid reiterated his thanks and 
appreciation for the efforts of both presidents, Husni Muharak 
and Shaykh Zayid. Those efforts were aimed at stopping the 
bloodshed in Yemen, which began after the launch of the doomed 
war by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his secessionist and 
adventuristic gang after he lost patience with the widespread 
agreement and overall national consensus regarding the pledge 
and accord document. The brother deputy chairman of the 
Presidential Council briefed his two brothers, Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak and Zayid Bin-Sultan, about developments in the military 
situation along all the axes of the fighting. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid has also spoken on the telephone 
with his brother, His Majesty King Husayn of Jordan. He briefed 
him on the situation in Yemen which resulted from the ill-fated 
war sparked off by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. Brother 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid expressed great appreciation for the role played by 
Jordan in attempting to stop the deterioration of the situation 
in Yemen. He confirmed his earnestness in responding to all 
fraternal and friendly efforts to return to political dialogue, 
and to submit to the true and serious implementation of the 
pledge and accord document.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, YSP </F>
Political Bureau member and special envoy of Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd; place and date not given; 
from the "Dialogue From Afar" Program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] Why have these bloody incidents broken 
out in Yemen in this way and at this particular time? Even 
though everyone is talking about Yemeni unity and maintaining 
it, why do we see the opposite? 
  [Al-Dali] Regrettably we would not have liked to talk about 
such incidents, such bloody, painful, and tragic incidents. But 
as you have observed, the incidents began some time ago with the 
liquidation of the southern brigades stationed in the northern 
governorates. As the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] did not take 
any military stand on these liquidations, influential elements 
in Sanaa seem to have taken advantage of this situation and 
began to liquidate the Ba-Suhayb Brigade. This, in turn, led to 
the flare up of the military situation. The military mentality, 
which thinks there is a military solution for Yemeni problems, 
is the cause of this situation. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] You had some demands about implementing the 
Pledge and Accord Document and emphasized the first article of 
that document, which concerns security. Can we have a further 
explanation? 
  [Al-Dali] Yes, we had demands that were agreed on by all 
those who signed the document, including the brothers in the 
General People's Congress. We signed an agreement that the 
assassins of the YSP leaders and those who wreaked havoc on the 
country and brushed the citizens' and Yemen's security aside 
must be arrested. We said this was the first step to restoring 
confidence and that they must arrest the assassins first to 
enable us to stay in Sanaa and prepare for the committees' 
meeting. But this did not happen and the agreement's first 
article has not been implemented. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] And this is why the war began? 
  [Al-Dali] They wanted to evade the implementation of the 
document and cause the military situation to flare up. They 
never liked the document and were not ready to implement it. 
They aggravated the military situation to avoid public pressure 
on them to implement the document. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] How can this situation be reversed now that 
the 
Arab League Council has held a session in Cairo and the 
secretary general was entrusted with consulting Yemeni leaders 
to stem this bloodshed? In your view, what measures are 
required to stop this bloodshed? 
  [Al-Dali] First, halt the fighting, then disengage the 
forces, and then give the brothers--the Arab League, the Arab 
brothers led by Egypt--an opportunity to try for a political 
solution to this stormy crisis. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Before this explosion of the situation, there 
were mediatory efforts by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, 
and you both signed the Pledge and Accord Document in Amman. 
These mediations did not succeed; why? Is it because of you or 
because of others? 
  [Al-Dali] In fact, we did adhere to the document and still 
want to implement it. We have said that the situation has to be 
normalized and confidence restored. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Will you continue to pursue unity? 
  [Al-Dali] Certainly, certainly. Unity would be ours and the 
Yemeni people's, and we will carry on with it. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Despite all that has happened? 
  [Al-Dali] Despite everything. But we will rectify our 
situation. It has to be corrected. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] How? 
  [Al-Dali] This is up to the dialogue. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] How can there be a dialogue while guns still 
heard? 
  [Al-Dali] Fighting has to stop first; the bloodshed must be 
stemmed. And then we should return to the negotiating table and 
begin to implement the document. These are our demands as a 
communist party. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Is the YSP willing to stop the bloodshed or 
will it fight unilaterally? 
  [Al-Dali] We are willing. But if we halt the fighting while 
the other party insists on fighting, will we not surrender 
ourselves for a massacre? 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Are you willing to accept... 
  [Al-Dali, interrupting] Yes in principle. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] But are you willing to accept Arab buffer 
forces, if such a proposal is resubmitted, discussed, and 
accepted by the Arab league? 
  [Al-Dali] If necessary. If it is necessary and there is no 
other way to halt the fighting, we have no objections at all. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Do you not refuse to receive an Arab 
delegation 
carrying these proposals? 
  [Al-Dali] Not at all. We have no objection if all other 
means are exhausted. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Finally, what is the true and effective way 
out 
of this crisis to save the Yemeni people and halt the bloodshed? 
  [Al-Dali] We believe we are suffering a caesarean section 
with this new situation in Yemen. When we demand a halt to the 
fighting, we mean to alleviate the pains and afflictions of this 
caesarean section. That is all I can say. We insist on halting 
the fighting, not because of a sense of defeat nor to avert the 
outcome, but to spare the blood of the Yemeni youths who are 
being killed here and there.

  [Text] In a statement on Voice of the Arabs Radio today, 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Dali, member of the politburo of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] and secretary of the YSP Central 
Committee, called for the need to stop the fighting first and 
then to separate the combatants. He stressed to Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak that he was convinced of the importance 
of giving the Arab League and the Arab brothers latitude for 
finding a solution to the Yemeni crisis. It is worth mentioning 
that Brother Dr. al-Dali has delivered a number of letters from 
Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the deputy chairman of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the YSP Central 
Committee, to his brother leaders of fraternal Arab states.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Aden branch of the 
Ministry of Interior and Security has said in a statement to the 
YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, SABA'', that life in the economic and 
commercial capital, Aden, is proceeding normally, in spite of a 
few desperate attempts to subject the city to air bombardment 
from time to time -- in order to attack certain vital economic 
installations and civil institutions -- which have been 
unleashed by aircraft belonging to the bloody gang. The source 
stressed that the Aden branch of the ministry had taken all 
necessary measures and precautions to assure the freedom and 
safety of the citizens, and to ensure their security and 
livelihoods. These include civil defense measures and the 
securing of sources of water and supplies. 
  The source called on all the citizens to adhere to security 
and stability, and to persevere with their normal daily 
activities. The source said that public and private supplies 
and consumer installations would continue to render services. 
Such installations include restaurants, gas stations, butane 
gas depots, and the like. 
  The source went on to say that the Aden branch of the 
Ministry of Cooperatives, the municipality, and other relevant 
quarters would apply stern measures against anyone attempting to 
incite citizens, hoard foodstuffs or consumer goods, or stir up 
disputes concerning supplies. Such measures would include the 
withdrawal of trading licenses from business concerns, bakeries, 
or restaurants which closed their doors to the needs of the 
citizens to prevent them from having access to their products. 
  Concluding the statement, the source called on all citizens 
to cooperate with the police and to report any phenomena liable 
to undermine the stability of their security or livelihood.

  [Text] Rival Yemeni armies battled for a sixth day today in 
a bloody confrontation shredding the volatile state's 
three-year-old unity. A Yemeni military spokesman in Sanaa has 
said that fierce fighting was under way in the southern 
provinces of Aden and Lahij. The spokesman said that the four 
brigades of the northern army were advancing on Aden and 
predicted the city would fall today. But in a radio broadcast, 
the south denied that northern forces had reached the outskirts 
of Aden where a general mobilization had been ordered to defend 
the city. 
  Meanwhile, the English language YEMEN TIMES, published in 
Sanaa, reported that 12,000 people had been already killed or 
wounded in the fighting, but it gave no source. 
  On the other hand, Western embassies in Sanaa said that they 
were planning further evacuations today. About 230 British and 
Commonwealth nationals were expected to leave. The United 
States, Germany, Italy, and French Embassies had similar plans, 
but gave no numbers.

  [Text] Riyadh, May 7 (AFP) -- Two U.S. planes evacuated 360 
foreign nationals, mostly Americans, from Sanaa and flew them 
out of Yemen's civil war to safety in Saudi Arabia on Saturday, 
diplomatic sources said. 
  U.S. Embassy staff in the Saudi capital greeted the 
evacuees, 
also including British, German, Dutch and Egyptian nationals, at 
Riyadh airport, the sources said. 
  The United States said Friday it would evacuate 
non-essential 
diplomatic personnel from Yemen and advised other U.S. nationals 
to leave the country because of the fighting between northern 
and southern forces. 
  In Washington, State Department spokesman Christine Shelly 
said the U.S. had issued a travel warning for American citizens 
and was making arrangements for those in Yemen to leave. 
  Officials expect as many as 1,000 of the estimated 5,150 
U.S. 
nationals in Yemen to leave soon, she added.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The civil war in Yemen: According to 
the North Yemenis, Aden -- the southern economic capital -- is 
about to fall into their hands. They claim that there is fierce 
fighting around the gates of the town; in any case Sanaa's 
military supremacy has been confirmed today by French military 
sources based in Djibouti. They said that the situation was 
turning to the advantage of the northern forces. A general 
mobilization was decreed in Aden today. 
  There have been more evacuations of foreigners today, both 
in 
the north and south. There were three simultaneous operations. 
[passage omitted] 
  Pierre-Xavier (Colinet), the commander of the Jules Verne, 
was interviewed by our colleagues from France Inter: 
  [Begin (Colinet) recording] At the moment I am a few 
kilometers south of Aden. I have just picked up nationals 
belonging to a number of countries. There are 288 people -- 
men, women, and children -- who were picked by the Edic, a small 
tank landing craft which is very suitable for this kind of 
operation. They were picked up in the port of Aden. This was 
overseen by the consul. I am taking them on to the Jules Verne, 
which is a large ship, to give them food and beds, and I expect 
to take them to Djibouti. 
  At the same time as the Edic and its crew, there was a squad 
of naval commandos on board, accompanied by some other commandos 
[sentence as heard]. 
  According to the people on the quay, there are no visible 
traces of fighting. But we did see a certain amount of shooting 
in the distance, especially from the area of the airport, which 
is to the east of the place where the people are embarking. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] Let me add that Pierre-Xavier (Colinet), the 
commander of the Jules Verne, said that another round trip by 
the ship is planned for tomorrow: There are still 30 French 
people to be evacuated from Aden. 
  In the east, in al-Mukalla, 80 foreigners were being 
evacuated by French ships today. The UN World Food Program has 
sent a plane to North Yemen, to Sanaa to repatriate its staff.

However, the accord was not implemented and the king said last

  [Text] The Ministry of Supply and Trade warns all wholesale 
and retail dealers in the Republic of Yemen about the need to 
comply fully with the prices for all commodities that prevailed 
before the emergency was declared in the country. Anyone 
breaching this warning will be find, have his trade registration 
confiscated, and his shop closed. He will also be subject to 
direct imprisonment. 
  The ministry will launch a supply monitoring campaign to 
control commodity prices. A team from the Ministry of Supply 
and Trade, the Interior Ministry, and the capital's municipality 
will take part in the campaign. The ministry's Aden branch and 
the supply offices in the republic's governorates should also 
form committees from the offices, the ministry's monitors, and 
the governorate's security operations for this purpose. 
  We hope everyone will comply and cooperate. It is God who 
grants success.

  [Text] Following the assassination of two French nationals 
in the capital Algiers today, Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi sent a 
cable of condolences to his French counterpart, Edouard 
Balladur, on behalf of the government and in his personal name, 
which stated that the Algerian authorities will do their utmost 
to arrest the perpetrators of this crime. This is no more than 
a confirmation, the head of government adds, regarding combating 
terrorism. 
  The interior minister has deplored, in a statement released 
this evening, this abominable action and offered condolences to 
the families of the two victims and the whole of the French 
community regarding this tragic incident. 
  The interior minister stressed that Algeria is known for its 
tradition of hospitality and its respect of human life and is 
not and will never be a home for criminals and killers. The 
perpetrators of this operation will be sought and punished 
severely, he said. 
  Regarding the terrorist activities, the security services 
announced today that they had eliminated 15 terrorists and 
arrested 5 others between Monday and Saturday at various parts 
of the country.

  [Excerpts] On the same day when the Algerian people are 
commemorating the painful May massacres, over 20 national 
associations and organizations have called for staging marches 
throughout various provinces of the homeland supporting the 
national dialogue and rejecting violence and extremism. 
  These marches are supported by many political parties, in 
the 
forefront of which are the National Liberation Front [FLN], the 
Rally for Culture and Democracy, the Islamic Ennahda Movement, 
and the Islamic Society Movement, HAMAS. 
  Amidst tight security measures, the march began after a 
delay 
of about one hour. The radio team is with us live: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Yes, Djamila, the march 
dispersed a short time ago--about 15 minutes ago--after having 
lasted for about two hours to cross the distance between 1 May 
Square and Martyrs Square. The start of the march at the 
scheduled time, at 1000, was delayed in order to allow 
participants to leave their offices. The early time and the 
tight security requirements were the reasons for the delay. 
[passage omitted] 
  This was evident from the fact that after the reading out of 
the statement that crowned the march--15 minutes 
ago--participants kept flowing into Martyrs Square. The march 
passed calmly and quietly, broken only by the occasional 
trilling cries of joy from the women. 
  Alongside the members of the march preparatory committee and 
representatives of 20 associations, two political figures were 
present. They were Abdelhamid Mehri, secretary general of the 
FLN, and Mahfouz Nahnah, leader of the HAMAS Movement. 
  The banners that were raised were agreed upon, among them: 
"No to Violence, Yes to Dialogue"; "No to Extremism"; "No to 
Exclusion, Yes to Meeting". A large banner carrying the slogan 
of the national reconciliation was at the front of the march. 
  The number of participants in the march is not known 
precisely. The observations were conflicting. Some of the 
organizers expressed satisfaction, claiming that the number of 
the participants was 100,000 persons. Some observers, among 
them journalists, noted that the number did not exceed 30,000 or 
40,000 persons. The official estimates might resolve this issue. 
  A statement, which was a message addressed to the president 
of the state, was read out at the end of the march. The 
statement stressed that the initiative was an expression of 
civilized behavior to open a new chapter in which all the sons 
of the homeland meet. The initiative is also an expression to 
reject violence, reject one-upmanship--regardless of the 
slogans--and reject the solutions that contradict national 
constant and firm principles. 
  The statement also expressed support for the president of 
the 
state in his endeavors for national reconciliation through 
comprehensive and deep dialogue. 
  This was a general report about the march. From the street 
where the march took place, here is a report from colleague 
Ahmad Khaida: 
  [Khaida] Mohamed, this march--which some participants 
considered to be a march of hope and others a march of a new era 
for Algeria--has stirred various reactions. Some of those 
interviewed said that, from a historical point of view, the 
march is a symbol and an example. One of them said that the 1 
May Square is a symbol of work, and the Martyr Square is a 
symbol of martyrdom. [passage omitted] 
  We also remind you that some of the parties rejected 
participating in the march. Among these was the Socialist 
Forces Front, which said the march was not in harmony with the 
democratic principles of the party. The Party of Algerian 
Renewal said such initiatives would only intensify the tension. 
The Ettahadi Movement said that those for reconciliation and 
dialogue, as they called them, pave the way in front of what the 
Movement called fundamentalists, and would constitute a mount 
from which they could pounce on the government. The Algerian 
General Workers Union barred its unionists from participating in 
the march. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Anwar Haddam, exiled leader of the Islamic </F>
Salvation Front, by Gilles Millet in London; date not given: 
"Islamic Salvation Front Must Be Recognized as Political Party" 
-- first three paragraphs are LIBERATION introduction] 
  [Text] On Sunday [8 May] there will be a demonstration in 
Algiers "for dialogue and reconciliation." So far, the dialogue 
wanted by President Liamine Zeroual seems to be deadlocked. We 
met in London with Anwar Haddam, one of the leaders of the 
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and an elected member of 
Parliament since 1991. Currently a refugee in the United 
States, he gave us his views on the prerequisites for a 
successful dialogue. 
  Like most exiled FIS leaders, Anwar Haddam finds it 
difficult 
to voice an opinion on the various actions perpetrated in 
Algeria by the armed islamic groups. While he confirms that 
assaults against police forces are indeed part of the strategy 
of fundamentalist leaders, his answers are much foggier when it 
comes to the murders of intellectuals, journalists, and 
anonymous civilians. He does condemn the killing of "innocent 
people." However, as he himself puts it, "we need to agree on 
the meaning of the word `innocent.'" In his opinion, 
"pseudo-intellectuals or pseudo-democrats for whom democracy 
ends where their failure begins" are not "innocent." In other 
words, they deserve being fundamentalist targets. 
  To a direct question on the murders of Algerian journalists, 
he answers: "I will not get into this. We suggested to our 
mujahidin brothers that they might hit on those who backed the 
coup. These are a group of extremist secularists who reject the 
choice of the Algerian people. It so happens that among them 
are a number of academics, journalists, politicians, 
soldiers..." And when the murders appear "dubious" to him, he 
rather expediently puts the blame on military security forces. 
  [Millet] Algeria seems to be in a dead end. Do you think 
talks are still possible between the authorities and 
fundamentalists? 
  [Haddam] From the very outset we have asked for a political 
solution to be found through serious negotiation. Trouble is, 
those who forcibly seized power have no clear policy on the 
matter. The FIS is a political party. Therefore, it was not 
ready to go into armed conflict. After the December 1991 coup, 
we were faced with a new situation. This is why orders were 
given to people to organize locally and target all those who 
were illegally clinging to power, including security forces, 
which were supposed to preserve the institutions and respect the 
people's choice. We made good headway and the mujahidins 
(freedom fighters) now are an organized entity which will abide 
by FIS decisions in case of serious negotiations. 
  [Millet] What do you mean by "serious negotiations"? 
  [Haddam] We asked those currently in power to clarify their 
position. To begin with, they must acknowledge the fact that 
political authority may only spring from the choice of the 
people. Unelected, self-styled "decisionmakers" cannot play a 
part in the talks. Then they must agree to implement a genuine 
separation between the three powers: Parliament, the executive, 
and the judiciary. This means that we reject any encroachment 
on political power by the Armed Forces or intelligence services. 
Moreover, Algeria's sovereignty and unity must be preserved. 
Those in power should not be allowed to stir up trouble in 
areas such as Kabylia, for instance. These prerequisites tie in 
with another, basic one: All decisions made since the 
interruption of the democratic process must be repealed, 
including the ban on the FIS. The FIS must be recognized as a 
political party. 
  [Millet] Does this mean that no real negotiations will take 
place as long as the authorities have not committed themselves 
to organizing elections? 
  [Haddam] Indeed it does. Not only must the FIS' legitimacy 
be recognized, a formal statement must be issued with respect to 
the reactivation of the electoral process, and international 
assurances must be obtained, especially from France. And last 
but not least, all jailed islamists must be released. 
  [Millet] Who has been or must be involved in the talks? 
  [Haddam] The FIS, with the mujahidin's assent, decided that 
only Abassi Madani, the party's president, and Ali Belhadj, its 
vice president, are mandated to participate in potential 
negotiations with those in power. This is what happened. The 
talks have now ground to a halt because Zeroual (the president 
of the Republic) has his hands tied and therefore cannot 
recognize the FIS as a political party. 
  [Millet] Should the negotiation be successful, will FIS 
leaders be able to put an end to the violence? 
  [Haddam] Yes. The FIS leadership, taken as a whole, will be 
able to do this. 
  [Millet] And yet, it seems that in the field armed groups no 
longer recognize the FIS political leadership as legitimate. 
  [Haddam] Over 80 percent of combatants are now part of a 
single entity. We share the same objective and same strategy. 
Now, I do not intend to be more specific; nobody was mandated 
by the mujahidin to talk about their structures. 
  [Millet] What do you think of France's current position with 
regard to Algeria? 
  [Haddam] On both sides of the Mediterranean there are people 
who find it hard to shed their colonial mentality. In Algeria, 
it is a group of soldiers supported by extremist secularists, 
while in France it is the intelligence services, which have a 
big hand in your country's foreign policy. France needs to 
admit that there have been changes in the Maghreb. We can no 
longer accept the idea that a country still thinks of itself as 
the colonial power in the region. France has been trying in 
good faith to help Algeria economically. However, this aid does 
not reach the Algerian people; only those in power have been 
benefiting from it. It is time to stop urging the European 
Union to support Algeria. In any case, we shall not recognize 
any economic agreement between the current Algerian Government 
and the international community. In addition, it is intolerable 
that French authorities should persist in refusing the FIS the 
right to be represented in France while they accept other 
Algerian political parties. Some of our followers have been 
arrested, jailed, or put under house arrest even though they had 
committed no crime. It is time for the international community, 
including France, to be able to listen to us directly instead of 
dealing with people who are in power only because they took it 
forcibly.

  [Text] The failure of yesterday's demonstration for 
dialogue in Algiers is doubtless partly due to the fact that 
some of the legal political circles did not take part, but 
mainly to the fact that it was boycotted by the Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS]. According to the daily AL-WATAN, the 
reason is that the slogans chosen were a concession to the 
authorities, and the organizers did not enjoy credibility. 
Furthermore, the FIS apparently blamed these organizers for 
refusing to call for the release of its leaders and for the 
rehabilitation of the movement. Evidently the proclamation by 
the new Algerian authorities of dialogue without exceptions is 
not meeting with much response from the Islamists of the FIS. 
It must be said that the FIS is setting very hard conditions 
before agreeing to hold discussions. For the FIS, before any 
discussion, the authorities have to admit that they themselves 
are illegal. Hachemi Sahnouni, a founding member of the FIS, 
explains: 
  [Begin Sahnouni recording] In December-January, the 
authorities contacted us via the dialogue commission. They 
contacted several Islamist tendencies of the FIS [as heard], and 
then nothing. They did not contact me or people in contact with 
me. We can negotiate, in the hope of arriving at the following 
goal: Namely that the authorities admit that they are illegal, 
that they do not represent the Algerian people, and they must 
give in to the demands of the people. Otherwise there is no 
point in negotiating. If we negotiate in order to allow the 
current authorities to remain in power, so that the problems of 
the people remain the same, or perhaps get worse, I see it as 
being pointless to negotiate. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "Authorities Admit to Salvation </F>
Front That Canceling Election Results Was a Mistake"] 
  [Text] Paris -- Sources close to the Islamic Salvation 
Front [FIS] have revealed further details about the contacts 
made between the detained FIS shaykhs and Algerian authorities. 
The sources said the contacts "were marathon rounds of 
dialogue, some of which continued until the early hours of the 
morning. They were led for the state by Major General Tayyib 
Daradji, inspector general of the ground forces, and a 
Constitutional Council member named Kebir. President Zeroual 
attended two rounds in his capacity as defense minister before 
his assumption of the presidency. He stressed to FIS shaykhs 
that he was talking with them in the Army's name." The sources 
said that the meetings began on the evening of 30 December 1993, 
and that the last meeting was held on 18 February. 
  The sources quoted FIS shaykhs as saying that those 
representing the authorities in the talks "admitted the mistake" 
of canceling the elections, and tried to persuade FIS shaykhs to 
participate in the national dialogue conference or recommend 
someone to represent them. They also asked the shaykhs to issue 
a statement condemning terrorism. But the shaykhs rejected 
these demands and offered to issue a joint statement with the 
regime, specifying the points on which the two sides agree, most 
importantly the authorities' admission of their mistake in 
canceling the elections. 
  The shaykhs also insisted on the "legitimacy" of the jihad, 
saying it is "the right of the Algerian people, whose rights 
have been usurped." They demanded that the "person responsible" 
for the present situation be identified in a joint statement. 
But the authorities rejected all these demands, only responding 
to part of the shaykhs' conditions, namely releasing two of 
them, Shaykhs Ali Djeddi and Abdelkader Khamkham, and allowing 
them to work freely to get in touch with the detained shaykhs to 
tell them of the situation, hence enabling them to make their 
decisions and negotiate once again with the authorities. 
  It seems that all parties are awaiting the outcome of the 8 
May march, which will demand dialogue. The march has been 
called by the major Algerian parties. The FIS is expected to 
participate in it powerfully. FIS leaders will watch the march 
to see how the regime will deal with FIS supporters. The march 
will also give the FIS the opportunity to test its ability to 
mobilize the scene once again. 
  Algerian sources say that the negotiations between the 
regime 
and the FIS will resume after 8 May. The most important topic 
is expected to be "the resumption of the canceled elections." 
  Sources close to the FIS say that the "Front cannot agree to 
new elections. Because there is no trust at all in the present 
authority, and new elections would grant the illegitimate 
authorities that have assumed power in Algeria since the 2 
January 1992 coup the legitimacy they are looking for, thus 
enabling them to rig the elections completely and to claim that 
the FIS has lost the popularity it enjoyed in the past, and then 
resort to violence and terrorism against the Front under an 
alleged legitimacy."

<F P=106> [Report by Kamil al-Tawil: "Algeria: Salvation Front </F>
Advised Not To Exploit Sunday March"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Contacts intensified in Algeria 
yesterday to ensure the success of the march to be staged 
tomorrow [as published] in support of the dialogue and 
reconciliation. 
  Well-informed Algerian sources have revealed to AL-HAYAH 
that 
there are fears that some elements might "exploit" the march in 
favor of a certain party, namely the (disbanded) Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS]. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received in 
London, FIS denied reports in Algeria of the death of Major 
General Abdelkader Shabouti and the murder of Said Makhloufi, 
leaders of the Armed Islamic Movement, the FIS' military arm. 
The statement said that "the reports (of their death) are 
circulated by the defeated security services and some communist 
circles with a view to hampering the good offices of unofficial 
quarters to calm the situation in the country, and causing 
confusion in order to thwart the national march" to be staged 
tomorrow [as published], Sunday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] As part of Arab endeavors to contain the crisis in 
Yemen, today [7 May] Algeria reiterated its preparedness to 
contribute all it can to the settlement of the Yemeni crisis, 
calling on both sides of the conflict to stop the fighting. 
  An authorized source at the Foreign Ministry said today that 
Algeria is following the events in Yemen with concern and calls 
on both parties to the conflict to begin a dialogue. 
  The source added that because of its feeling of 
responsibility as a member state and as current president of the 
Arab Maghreb Union, Algeria has recently made a number of 
political moves in an effort to reconcile the viewpoints of the 
two parties in conflict.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper regrets what 
is happening in Yemen. It says it is difficult for an Arab to 
see brothers shed each other's blood in the same country, 
destroying everything that the one Yemeni people have both in 
the north and south. 
  In today's editorial, the paper notes that since it began a 
few months ago the Yemeni crisis has portended grave 
consequences and that it entails grave dangers, especially since 
the exchange of air bombardments in Aden and Sanaa and 
resolutions declaring the vice president illegitimate and 
dismissing the defense minister. 
  The paper says the Arabs have not learned much from the hard 
lessons they have suffered in their modern history. What is 
happening in Yemen is the best proof of this, as the Declaration 
of Unity through harmony and peace is retracted and replaced by 
war and conflict. 
  The newspaper notes Egypt's efforts to contain the Yemeni 
crisis before it worsens. President Mubarak, it says, has sent 
an envoy who has almost become a resident there. So far he has 
addressed two appeals to the Yemeni brothers to stop subjecting 
their country to destruction, but all this has been in vain.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ahmad al-Qasir: "The Leaders of Yemen Must </F>
Fear God and Heed the Interests of Their Country and Their 
Nation"] 
  [Excerpts] While all the world's nations are rushing to 
solve their problems peacefully and seeking to establish 
political and economic blocs to meet the requirements of the new 
world order, and while the Arab nation is doing all it can to 
remove the aftermath of the criminal Iraqi aggression against 
Kuwait and bring the Arabs together once again, the Arab nation 
is hit by a new horrible tragedy, as if the costly disasters and 
woes it has faced over the past decades were not enough. By 
this new plight we mean the outbreak of unprecedented vicious 
fighting among the sons of fraternal Yemen in the north and the 
south. [passage omitted] 
  Seeing such an Arab plight and painful tragedy, it was 
inevitable for Egypt, as always, to rush to save the people of 
Yemen from destruction. Egypt proceeded from its historical and 
pan-Arab responsibility toward the Arab nation. The swift 
Egyptian moves were embodied by the many contacts President 
Husni Mubarak held with Arab leaders to put an end to the bloody 
conflict in fraternal Yemen, and by Egypt's call for an urgent 
Arab League Council meeting to appeal to the warring parties to 
end the armed struggle, stop the bloodshed, and preserve the 
unity of fraternal Yemen. 
  Thanks to his pan-Arab sentiments, farsightedness, and 
discerning vision, President Mubarak realized the seriousness of 
the Yemeni crisis at its eruption. He worked seriously, in 
cooperation and coordination with the Arab leaders, to avoid the 
bloody conflict. He repeatedly sent special envoys to Sanaa and 
Aden in an attempt to heal the rift and bring the viewpoints of 
the brothers closer. But it seems that the Arab nation has 
hired forces, blinded by fanaticism, working for their own 
interests. They worked to escalate the crisis, not realizing 
its serious implications against the unity of the people of 
Yemen, its negative impact on the course of Arab solidarity, and 
its direct threat to the entire pan-Arab security. Yemen's 
important strategic and geographic position cannot be ignored at 
all. [passage omitted] 
  Egypt is once again appealing to the leaders of Yemen to 
fear 
God and heed the interests of their country, nation, and 
religion. It is appealing to them to rise to their pan-Arab 
responsibility and to rush to suppress the sedition before it 
becomes too great to control. This requires that the parties 
sit down together at the negotiating table in a spirit of 
brotherhood and love and renounce enmity and hatred. More 
importantly, the people of Yemen should be given a chance to 
express their will and give their decisive word as to who should 
rule them through constitutional channels. Then, the enemies of 
the Yemeni unity will not be able to sell their commodity, the 
masks will fall from their faces, and peace will once again 
prevail on the land of fraternal Yemen. Woe betide those who 
want to turn the wheel of history backward.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 May (MENA)--In their editorials today, 
AL-AHRAM and AL-JUMHURIYAH express deep regret at the escalation 
in Yemen, where there is a strong possibility of a long-term war 
in which many innocent people will be killed and the country's 
economic resources will be destroyed. 
  AL-AHRAM says the military escalation was accompanied by a 
political one as Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
rejected any Arab or non-Arab mediation or entry of Arab troops 
to disengage the warring sons of Yemen in the north and south. 
Salih, the paper notes, justified this by saying these events 
are a Yemeni internal affair. 
  The paper expresses the fear that secret foreign 
intervention 
may take place by providing the two sides, or one of them, with 
enough weapons to prolong the armed struggle, especially since 
some quarters do not wish well to Yemen or the Arabs in general. 
  The paper recalls the tragedy Lebanon suffered for 16 
continuous years. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH says no one imagined that the unity between 
the 
two parts of Yemen would collapse so soon and turn into a war 
between the two sides. 
  The door is now open to all opponents of Yemeni unity to 
show 
their opposition by taking sides and providing either side with 
money and weapons, the paper says. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH expresses astonishment that the Yemeni people 
should be divided by bloody wars as they face terrible problems, 
such as the country's inability to meet its people's basic needs 
for food and shelter. Indeed, the paper adds, many schools and 
educational facilities were built by grants from Egypt, some 
Gulf states, and other fraternal countries.

  [Excerpt] Amman, 6 May (MENA)--Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi stated that Egypt's leadership and security organs are 
confronting terrorism and terrorists with the firmness and 
strength they deserve and that all their activities are 
confronted decisively. He said: We should not worry about Egypt. 
  Speaking at a meeting with members of the Egyptian community 
in Jordan before leaving Amman this afternoon, the prime 
minister said that compared with other countries, terrorism in 
Egypt is decreasing in a big way. 
  Answering a question, he said that attempts were made over a 
long period to hold a dialogue with these terrorists at times 
between 1980 and 1987 or 1988. He added: The dialogue 
continued in one way or another but they were not ready to 
listen to the voice of reason and their ideas rendered the 
dialogue useless. When they started to use bullets and kill, the 
security organs confronted them decisively and firmly. 
  Dr. Sidqi stressed that achieving a lasting, just, and 
honorable peace in the region lies at the core of Egypt's 
policy. He said: Egypt welcomes the Israeli-Palestinian 
Agreement signed in Cairo on Wednesday on the basis that it is a 
step toward the comprehensive solution for all the countries in 
the region. [passage omitted]

  [Text] An Egyptian delegation led by Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa left for South Africa early this morning to attend the 
inauguration of President Nelson Mandela tomorrow, Tuesday. 
Before leaving, Musa expressed Egypt's happiness at the new era 
in South Africa, which has culminated the long struggle of the 
people there. This, he said, is a major success for Africa. He 
said he will convey to President Mandela a message from Husni 
Mubarak as president of Egypt and chairman of the OAU, which is 
pleased with the independence of this big country that will soon 
join the organization. 
  The foreign minister pointed out Egypt's contribution to the 
supervision of South Africa's elections, which were completely 
free. He said Egypt and South Africa will work to promote their 
relations, and noted that Egypt will resume diplomatic relations 
with South Africa tomorrow. 
  The foreign minister said he will leave South Africa for 
London Wednesday on an official visit to Britain. He said he 
will hold talks with British Prime Minister John Major, Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd, and senior Foreign Office and House of 
Commons officials on issues of concern to the two countries and 
ways to boost bilateral ties. He said the Lockerbie issue will 
be one of the topics of discussion with the British officials.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 8 May (MENA)--The People's Assembly held a 
meeting today chaired by Speaker Dr. Ahmad Fathi Surur. It 
approved the president of the Republic's decree extending Law 
No. 29 of 1972 empowering the president of the Republic to issue 
decrees having the strength of law. The law is extended for 
three years and expires at the end of fiscal year 1994-1996. 
The bill was opposed by 11 members of the opposition and 
independents. 
  Commenting on opposition to the bill by deputy Lutfi Wakid 
of 
the National Progressive Unionist Grouping Party, Kamal 
al-Shadhili, minister of state for the People's Assembly and 
Consultative Council affairs, said that secrecy and speed in 
approving arms deals are necessary. Thus, the president of the 
Republic was authorized to issue such decrees, noting that 
submitting the bill to the People's Assembly in accordance with 
the law takes place after the president authorizes it and while 
the authorization is still valid. He stressed that the 
circumstances the Arab nation has been passing through require 
that Egypt have a strong army. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-'Azim Darwish: "The Decision of the </F>
Labor and Nasirite Parties To Coordinate Policies Could Be the 
Prelude To Setting Up a United Opposition Front"] 
  [Text] The Islamist-oriented Labour Party of Ibrahim Shukri 
and the erstwhile anti-Islamist Nasserist Democratic Party of 
Dia'-al- Din Dawud have decided to establish a joint secretariat 
for policy coordination in a move seen by some opposition 
sources as the first step toward the creation of an opposition 
"national front." 
  The move was reminiscent of Labour's attempt seven years ago 
to set up a national front to contest the 1987 parliamentary 
elections. The result, however, was smaller in scale--a 
trilateral alliance grouping Labour, the Liberal Party of 
Mustafa Kamil Murad and the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, which 
was dubbed the Islamic Alliance at the time. 
  Labour's rapprochement with the Nasserists--who are 
traditionally anti-Islamist--raised a few eye-brows because its 
alliance with the Brotherhood is very much alive. The Liberals 
walked out last year. 
  Hilmi Murad, Labour's deputy chairman, denied that the 
decision to close ranks with the Nasserists signalled that they 
were "in" and the Brotherhood was "out." For his part, 
Dia'-al-Din Dawud said the Nasserist Party was prepared for 
cooperation with all, and not only Labour. 
  Murad told Al-Ahram Weekly the move is "the start of forging 
cooperation with all opposition parties which may be ready to 
cooperate. By coordinating policies and exchanging views on 
public issues, the opposition will gain in strength and some 
type of front may be born." He said other opposition parties 
will be "contacted." 
  Dia'-al-Din Dawud said the Nasserist Party has no "political 
animosities. Our hands are stretched out for cooperation with 
all, in any sphere where a meeting of viewpoints may be 
possible." He said the Nasserists' relationship with Labour was 
"not of a special nature." 
  Offering his explanation of the developments that led to the 
coordination agreement, Dawud said that since the call for a 
national dialogue was issued by President Husni Mubarak, 
opposition parties have been holding coordination meetings. 
These meetings, he said, grouped not only the Nasserists and 
Labour but also the Wafd and the Progressive Unionist 
(al-Tajammu') parties and others. "Cooperation with all parties 
is continuing... The decision (to coordinate policies) with 
Labour is part of this framework and is part of meetings that 
are also taking place with others, and even more intensively 
with al-Tajammu'." 
  Murad did not deny the apparent contradiction between the 
Nasserists and Labour's Islamist orientation. "Yes, there are 
contradictions between us and any other opposition party... It 
is only natural that our programmers should be different. But 
some sort of cooperation and coordination is necessary." 
  Dawud, speaking in the same vein, said the leaders of all 
opposition parties had agreed to set up a coordination 
committee, but it has not been formed yet. "This goes to show 
that coordination will not be confined to Labour and the 
Nasserists. The principle has been approved in general." 
  Murad, asked why the rapprochement began with the 
Nasserists, 
although other parties appeared to be closer in position to 
Labour, said the Labour-Nasserists agreement "came by chance." 
He said the meeting between the two parties was also to include 
the Wafd and the al-Tajammu' "but this did not happen, for 
emergency reasons." He expressed hope the rapprochement will be 
"the nucleus of a national front." Asked whether the 
rapprochement was meant to make up for dwindling popular support 
resulting from Labour-Brotherhood differences, Murad replied: 
"Who said that popular support is declining? The attendance at 
party rallies is overwhelming and our newspaper has a gret 
readership." He said Labour's close relations with the 
Brotherhood will continue. 
  Dawud, answering a similar question, claimed the Nasserists 
have a stronger political presence than any other party, 
including the ruling National Democratic Party. "This is 
because we are the party which cares about the interests of the 
masses and which has been associated with policies that realised 
justice, equality and security for all the working factions of 
the people," he said. 
  Like Murad, Dawud expressed hope that a national front would 
be born. "I do not believe that the formation of this front 
will be difficult. I think that we are being driven by 
developments in the direction of its formation."

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Lebanese-Syrian Summit Held </F>
Suddenly in Damascus After U.S. Message to President al-Hirawi"] 
  [Excerpts] Beirut, London, Damascus -- Yesterday attention 
was focused on the Lebanese-Syrian summit held in Damascus and 
the investigation of crimes committed against the state's 
internal security and related reactions. [passage omitted] 
  The arrangements for the summit were made after a meeting 
held between Lebanese President al-Hirawi and U.S. Ambassador in 
Beirut Mark Hambley. 
  Responsible Syrian sources in Damascus have stated that the 
two presidents discussed and held consultations on the new 
developments in the region and the results of Christopher's 
visit and the Israeli proposals and ideas he brought with him on 
the peace process, withdrawals from the Golan, dismantling of 
the settlements, and especially the Lebanese question. They 
also discussed the position of the two countries regarding the 
current contacts for the resumption of the negotiations in 
Washington, which is what Christopher is now working for, 
particularly since the final signing of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement. 
  The two sides also reviewed the situation in Lebanon and 
bilateral relations. The arrival of President al-Hirawi, 
Speaker Birri, and Prime Minister al-Hariri was sudden and came 
after a meeting in Beirut between President al-Hirawi and the 
U.S. ambassador who delivered a message to him from Washington 
on the peace process. According to Lebanese sources, the 
message dealt with the situation in southern Lebanon and called 
on Lebanon to seek a settlement with Israel, disarm Hizballah, 
and put an end to the Lebanese resistance against Israel and its 
collaborators. 
  Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi reaffirmed coordination of 
their positions and effective moves to face the negative 
consequences of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The sources believe that the U.S. message upset the Lebanese 
leaders who immediately went to Damascus to discuss the 
situation. The message warned that Israel might continue its 
scorched-earth policy and carry out more score-settling 
operations unless the Lebanese officials quickly cool the 
situation in the south and unless they rejoin the peace process.

  [Text] A round of official talks was held today at the 
Foreign Ministry between a Syrian delegation led by Foreign 
Minister Faruq al-Shar' and a Japanese delegation led by Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa. The meeting was attended by Raslan 
'Allush, assistant foreign minister, and the heads of the 
Foreign Ministry's Economic, Organizational, and Asia 
Departments. On the Japanese side, the meeting was attended by 
(Takaya Sodo), director of the Middle East and Africa 
Department; (Hiroshi Hirabayashi), director of the Economic 
Cooperation Department; and the Japanese ambassador in Damascus. 
  Discussions touched on the situation in the region and 
developments in the Middle East peace process. In this regard, 
the two sides underlined their countries' desire to achieve a 
just and comprehensive peace based on the implementation of UN 
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and international 
legitimacy. 
  They also discussed the ties of cooperation and friendship 
between Syria and Japan and means of improving them in all 
fields. The two sides underlined their desire to strengthen 
these ties. In this regard, the two sides agreed to meet 
tomorrow on the level of experts to discuss economic cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  The Japanese minister and his delegation arrived in Damascus 
at noon today. He was received at Damascus International 
Airport by Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', the heads of the 
Foreign Ministry's Asia and Protocol Departments, and the 
Japanese ambassador in Damascus and the embassy staff. 
  Mr. Kakizawa made a statement to the SANA in which he 
praised 
the important political and economic position Syria occupies and 
the rich heritage from which it draws for its present and 
future. He praised Syrian-Japanese ties, which have seen 
tangible progress in recent years, stressing the need to bolster 
these ties in the future, particularly in the field of economic 
cooperation. 
  Regarding the peace process and Japan's role in achieving a 
just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, Kakizawa said: 
Japan has made a tangible effort to achieve security and peace 
in the world, both through its contributions to the UN budget 
and the disarmament and nuclear nonproliferation efforts. 
  He praised Syria's role and position in the Middle East and 
its role in finding the climate needed to establish just and 
comprehensive peace in the region, which cannot be achieved 
without Syria and its central role. He said: Japan supports 
the ongoing peace process and believes this process can be 
activated for the benefit of the peoples of the region. 
  Asked about the prospect for Japan's admittance as a 
permanent member to the UN Security Council, Kakizawa said: 
This quest is being supported by many countries in the world. 
Japan considers this support an evidence of these countries' 
appreciation of Japan's role in the international arena.

  [Text] Damascus, May 6 KYODO -- Syria's Foreign Minister 
Faruq al-Shar' told Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on 
Friday [6 May] that Syria is negative about joining multilateral 
peace talks in the Middle East peace process at the present 
stage. 
  In a 105-minute meeting with al-Shar', Kakizawa urged Syria 
to join the multilateral talks, Japanese officials said. 
Al-Shar', however, told Kakizawa that Syria will be pleased to 
join the talks if peace is achieved. But the talks will be 
vulnerable if peace is not achieved, al-Shar' was quoted as 
saying. Al-Shar' hinted at Damascus' position to demand a 
complete return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. 
  The Syrian foreign minister also argued that Mideast 
problems 
must be settled in line with UN Security Council resolutions 
that stipulate the inviolability of territories for all Mideast 
countries, the officials said. Al-Shar' offered his "personal 
support" for Japan's bid to obtain a permanent seat in the UN 
Security Council, saying that he will recommend the Syrian 
government to show support. 
  Kakizawa flew to Damascus from Amman on Friday.

  [Text] Damascus, May 7 KYODO -- Japan will convey to China 
and South Korea soon what Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is 
thinking about Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remark on 
Japan's World War II campaign, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
said Friday [6 May]. Kakizawa told Japanese reporters traveling 
with him that he has instructed Japan's embassies in Beijing and 
Seoul to inform the countries of Hata's thinking. Kakizawa said 
that the justice minister has taken back his remark that the 
1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication and that he thinks it 
wrong to define the war as a war of aggression by Japan. 
  Asked whether Nagano should leave the post of justice 
minister, Kakizawa said it is up to the prime minister to 
decide. Kakizawa also said he will convey his own idea to Hata 
after returning home Sunday. 
  Hata, at a news conference in Brussels on Friday, said he 
regrets Nagano's remarks but skirted the issue of whether he 
will seek Nagano's resignation. Hata said that he has 
reprimanded Nagano over the telephone for his remarks, which he 
characterized as "not appropriate." Hata, however, said, "I 
don't want to talk about (Nagano's) resignation at this stage." 
  In an interview with the mass-circulation daily MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN published Wednesday, Nagano, a former chief of staff of 
the Ground Self-Defense Force, said "the Nanjing incident was a 
fabrication," and "I still think it wrong to define the war as a 
war of aggression (by Japan)." He called a news conference 
Friday and retracted the remarks. 
  Following the invasion of the then Chinese capital of 
Nanjing 
in December 1937, Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more 
than 300,000 Chinese civilians, according to Chinese estimates. 
Japanese historians, however, tend to cite lower estimates. 
According to estimates given at the war crimes tribunal in 
Tokyo, about 42,000 civilians were killed in Nanjing and more 
than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war were killed in the 
vicinity over the next six weeks.

  [Text] Tehran, May 8 (AFP) -- An American woman whipped in 
Iran two weeks ago on charges of promoting prostitution is 
"probably a spy", a radical newspaper charged here Sunday. 
  Mary Jones, 35, was picked up two weeks ago in the Shemiran 
neighborhood in northern Tehran allegedly in a drunken state. 
She was immediately given 80 lashes of the whip after being 
found guilty in a court of "promoting corruption." 
  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI daily charged however that new information 
on Jones had led the authorities to believe that she was also 
engaged in espionage. 
  She paid visits to the war front during the 1980-1988 
conflict with Iraq and made "suspicious remarks" during 
interrogation after her arrest," it said. 
  However, a revolutionary court contacted by AFP denied there 
was any evidence of espionage activities against Jones, and that 
she had been arrested on corruption charges only. 
  The U.S. interests section at the Swiss embassy in Tehran 
declined to comment on the case. 
  The daily KEYHAN charged on Thursday that Jones, who has 
been 
here since 1983, came here "without identity papers and with the 
aim of corrupting the young in Iran." 
  KEYHAN said that Jones had been ordered to leave the 
country, 
but a judiciary official at the court refused to disclose if she 
had already been deported. 
  Iran banned the sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks 
after the 1979 Islamic revolution which toppled the late shah.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] On the publication of a part of a secret document 
entitled "U.S. policy regarding the issue of forming UN 
peacekeeping forces," the United States has explicitly regarded 
any threats to its own vital interests as threats to 
international peace and security. After the scandal resulting 
from the presence of American troops in Somalia and their 
ignominious withdrawal from that country, the issue of the mode 
of American participation in the formation of peacekeeping 
forces was put on the agendas of the U.S. Administration and 
Congress. After months of debate and enquiry, in a document 
that has been published recently, the United States has called 
for the clarification of eight points before it makes any 
decisions on dispatching of UN forces. [sentence as heard] 
  According to the U.S. president's national security adviser, 
the most important of those eight issues is whether U.S. 
interests will be guaranteed by the intervention of UN forces 
and whether international peace and security will be violated or 
the two will be threatened. Moreover, the United States seeks a 
definite table for UN operations on the basis of common 
objectives and political-military strategy, and the 
determination of the number of forces and a precise assessment 
of operation expenses. The United States will participate only 
in operations that will achieve total success with a maximum 
number of 15 casualties. 
  The fact that the United States regards any threat to its 
own 
vital interests as a threat to international peace and security 
and then shows interest in participating in the formation of 
peacekeeping forces is in reality the most conspicuous aspect of 
change in the United Nations after the Cold War era. 
  The approach of the permanent members of the UN Security 
Council toward world issues indicates that not much remains of 
the UN Security Council as an international council; and in fact 
the Western Members of the Security Council act as a board of 
directors, only safeguarding their own interests. During the 
Cold War era, those states used to abstain from participating in 
UN peacekeeping activities in the form of an implicit agreement. 
But at the moment, following changes in international 
circumstances, they are considered as the eminent activist in UN 
peacekeeping. That presence and cooperation is indicative of 
the change in the role of UN peacekeeping forces. 
  Peacekeeping is a term related to the Cold War era, an era 
when the two sides of a conflict would come to an agreement 
after a long period of fighting and UN soldiers would take the 
responsibility of guarding that agreement as a buffer and 
impartial force. During that era, which lasted from 1948 to 
1990, most UN soldiers were from north European states, Nepal, 
Sri Lanka, as well as some African states. But under present 
circumstances, the so-called peacekeeping force intervenes as 
one of the warring sides, oversees elections, purges police 
forces, armies, and government departments, and trains new 
forces; such that in operations in Cambodia the management of 
eight ministries was in the hands of those forces. In such a 
case peacekeeping is not the issue; the safeguarding of 
interests is the objective, and since those operations are 
selective, biased countries like America are attracted to them. 
  Under present world circumstances, because of the serious 
popular resistance in other countries in the face of 
interference by countries such as America in their internal 
affairs and public opinion, Western states that are the 
permanent members of the UN Security Council benefit from UN 
operations as a cover for their hegemonic objectives.

positive role to reduce the suffering of the Bosnian people. 
  Stressing the importance of agreement between the Muslims

Bosnia, he went on: This agreement has strengthened the 
position of the Muslims in the confrontation against the Serbs. 
  Referring to the opening ceremony of the Iranian Embassy in 
Sarajevo attended by the president of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mr. 
Velayati said: During the talks with the Bosnian president and 
other officials of that country, they thanked Iran for its 
constructive role and unstinting support for the people of 
Bosnia. 
  Mr. Velayati pointed out that the Serbs continue their 
aggression in other regions of the Republic of Bosnia. He 
warned the international community about the Serbs' new waves of 
aggressions in some regions of Bosnia, including Brcko.

the United Nations was not done. They informed us during the 
last few days that the United Nations had agreed. In our talks, 
the issue of opening the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy in 
Sarajevo, bilateral relations, and the recent changes between 
our relations and Croatia were discussed, taking into account 
the fact that the expansion of our relations with the Croatia 
will make a great contribution toward our relations with Bosnia. 
  During the last two years, the intention of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has been to pave the way for reconciliation and 
cooperation between Croats and Muslims. Today, both the Croats 
and Bosnian Muslims know that the tripartite relations between 
us, the Croats, and Muslims have turned into such organized and 
secure relations, that the more these relations consolidate the 
more the chances of our cooperation and through us, that of 
other Islamic countries increases with the Bosnian Muslims. 
  Mr. Izetbegovic, in his talks, in his official talks, 
clearly 
specified and said that Iran has played a very crucial role in 
the destiny of Bosnia and this will be recorded in history 
later. But, Mr. Izetbegovic said, that what I can say that if 
it was not for Iran, Bosnia would have had a different destiny. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran's embassy was opened in the 
presence of Mr. Izetbegovic. 
  [Correspondent] In general, how do you describe the 
situation 
in Sarajevo, and how much of a positive effect the assistance 
given by the people of Iran will have on the spirit of the 
people of Sarajevo? 
  [Velayati] The destruction that has remained from the 
long-term aggression of the Serbs is an obvious sign of an 
all-round oppression that has been inflicted on the Muslim 
people of Sarajevo who up to now are under the full siege of the 
Serbs. However, the people enjoy a very high spirit. One can 
feel very easily the belief and devotion of the people to Islam 
and freedom of Bosnia among the people of Bosnia. Concerning 
Iran, as I have mentioned, the people are united in their views 
that the Islamic Republic of Iran is their most honest defender 
and supporter. They do not mention this from an analytical 
viewpoint, but they say it plainly if anyone asks the people and 
officials of Bosnia. [end recording]

conversation with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl talked to him

Germany. 
  In this telephone conversation, the president expressed his 
anxiety about the repetition of the tragedy of Gorazde by the 
Serbs and stressed the need for a decisive and serious approach 
by the countries of the world and international organizations 
toward the Serb aggressors. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani also expressed his hope that the two 
countries will have a more active participation in the second 
economic and political development plan of Iran. 
  Mr. Kohl also said that the exchange of political and

  [Text] Tehran, May 8, IRNA -- Majles speaker 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri Sunday [8 May] lambasted the signing of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement between the Zionist regime and the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) last Wednesday and 
stressed that the Palestinian nation would not give in to 
abjection. 
  Speaking at the open sessison of the Islamic consultative 
assembly (majles), he termed the compromising trend of talks 
between Yasir 'Arafat and the Zionist regime as well as the 
signing of the Gaza-Jericho compromise deal as gradual 
humiliation of the PLO leaders and a bitter and regrettable 
development for the world of Islam and the muslims. 
  "It is crystal clear that the heroic nation of Palestine 
will 
continue their fight against occupiers of al-Quds and repulse 
the usurpers from al-Quds to materialize the divine promises," 
he stressed. 
  Turning to the victory of the African National congress in 
the all-race presidential elections in South Africa, Nateq-Nuri 
described it as a great and sweet event for all nations 
especially for the people of South Africa. 
  Congratulating the ANC leader Nelson Mandela and the South 
African nation on the victory, he expressed hope that Iran and 
South African relations would expand in all fields.

<F P=106> [Commentary by M. Pay'edar: "Rabin in Moscow"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Zionist regime's prime minister, Yitzhaq 
Rabin, arrived in Moscow on 24 April on a 4-day visit. This is 
the first visit to Russia by a high-level official of the 
Zionist regime, ostensibly in response to Kozyrev's visit to Tel 
Aviv last week. During his visit, Kozyrev had reminded the 
Israeli officials that despite its support for the Middle East 
peace process and an end to longstanding animosity between the 
Arabs and Israel, he is not satisfied with the actions taken so 
far and the prevailing trend of the talks. 
  Diplomatic sources resident in the Middle East state that 
Kozyrev had told Rabin during his visit to occupied Palestine 
that it is unacceptable to accord Russia a second-line role in 
the Middle East peace dealings. The same sources state that 
Kozyrev's unexpected behavior toward the Israeli officials was a 
result of the Zionist regime's cold reception to Russia's 
proposals regarding the future of peace in the Middle East. No 
official report has been released on the nature of these 
proposals, but Israeli sources state that Kozyrev had presented 
the following five recommendations to the Israeli officials in 
order to expedite the peace trend in the Middle East: 
  1. Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
  2. Halting construction of settlements on the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip until the fate of these two areas becomes clear 
in the peace talks. 
  3. Continuation of the talks in Moscow. 
  4. Russian assistance in lobbying for recognition of 
Israel by Syria and in persuading the latter to join the peace 
talks. 
  5. Motivating the Syrian leaders to end what Kozyrev 
referred to as support for hardline factions and anti-Zionist 
resistance groups in the region. 
  Even though Kozyrev's proposals were received with 
indifference by Israeli officials, Kozyrev asked Rabin to visit 
Moscow to deepen bilateral relations and for a better 
understanding of Russia's stance. 
  The importance of Tel Aviv-Moscow relations is worth 
assessing from two aspects: First, the relations and their 
inherent importance; and second, viewed in the context of the 
Middle East crisis. [passage omitted] 
  Israel has realized, for better or worse, that without 
taking 
Russia's viewpoint into account, no kind of peace process will 
be successful. Regardless of whether Tel Aviv has reached this 
conclusion in view of Syria's role in the Arab Middle East or 
because of the traditional role of the Russians in the Middle 
East, the Zionist regime's leaders have been motivated to accept 
changes in view of developments in the region that will in turn 
make them give certain concessions to the other side. What the 
privileges will be and whether it is possible to end the current 
impasse in the Middle East, only time will tell. 
  Independent news sources in Moscow have reported that in the 
course of his talks with the Russian president and prime 
minister, Rabin said that if Moscow does not revise its military 
treaty with Syria, withdrawal from the Golan Heights is out of 
the question. By supporting the anti-Israeli groups, Syria has 
proved that it is not serious about the peace talks. 
  The newspaper MA'ARIV, the mouthpiece of the Zionist 
regime's 
foreign ministry, referring to the above issue commented that 
Tel Aviv believes that the sale of Russian weapons to Syria has 
had a negative effect on the peace talks. [passage omitted] 
  For Russia to halt arms sales to Syria merely at Israel's 
behest or for it to place all its eggs in the U.S. basket 
without any major concessions would be an act of political 
naivete that seems quite unlikely. It seems certain that this 
will be a complicated and prolonged process and a test for 
Russian diplomacy in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. 
  This is why Rabin's trip to Moscow has not causes any 
concern 
among the Damascus leadership. Hafiz al-Asad is quite confident 
that Russia will not bestow any major privileges on Israel at 
the expense of its own interests or leave Syria at the mercy of 
a turbulence-ridden peace. [passage omitted] 
  Thus, Rabin's visit to Moscow may not herald any major 
changes in the current trend of Middle East talks. Besides, 
changes are not foreseeable. What is certain is that the 
anti-Zionist resistance and opposition to the growth of U.S. 
influence in the region will have a remarkable effect on the 
current treacherous trend. This opposition and resistance will 
not be limited to Damascus' perspective or viewpoint; even the 
Zionist regime's officials have admitted this. They have 
acknowledged that despite its influence among the Lebanese and 
Palestinian groups, Syria does not have tight control over their 
actions. 
  It is a fact that the green light from Russia and other 
regional countries to Israel will not terminate the resistance. 
One should concede that in view of the expansionist nature of 
Israel, which overtly conflicts with the people of the region 
who have been disillusioned by the contemptuous attitude of the 
United States, the Middle East will witness a new wave of 
violence and insecurity in the future.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Deputy Foreign Minister Muhammad </F>
Hashemi's Visit to Ankara"] 
  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Muhammad Hashemi held 
separate talks with Deputy Foreign Minister Ozdem Sanberk, 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and Minister of Internal Affair 
Nahit Mentese on bilateral relations in Ankara on 2 May. The 
sides stressed the need to have bilateral relations further 
improved and described the level of existing relations between 
Turkey and Iran as good and constructive. During his three-day 
visit, Hashemi is expected to hold talks with the Turkish 
officials on important regional issues, the situation in the 
Islamic world, and the crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  The relations between Turkey and Iran, which have many 
common 
historical and cultural ties, have been placed on a sound basis. 
The factor that requires the two countries to further strengthen 
their relations is the question of safeguarding their common 
interests in ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization]. Political 
and economic experts are convinced that the relations between 
Iran and Turkey should be viewed from three angles. Compared 
with the past, the economic relations between the two countries 
within ECO's framework are rather important for them. That is 
why they are maintained at a favorable level. 
  The trade and economic cooperation between the two countries 
in ECO's committees has significantly contributed toward the 
improvement of their relations. As far as the political aspect 
of their relations is concerned, Iran and Turkey need to take 
measures to defend their common border more effectively than in 
the past. In view of the fact that that matter has to be 
carefully followed, the two countries concluded important 
agreements on terrorism and border security during the past one 
and a half years. They have done so in accordance with the 
principle of noninterference in each other's internal affairs. 
Regarding regional issues, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have held 
several summits on the question of northern Iraq. The outcome of 
the summits and the bilateral relations between Iran and Turkey 
show the importance they attach to the establishment of peace 
and security in the region. 
  Iran and Turkey are two important ECO and ICO [Islamic 
Conference Organization] members. As such, they have many 
opportunities and resources to further improve their bilateral 
relations. In view of that, Hashemi's visit to Turkey should be 
assessed as the outcome of the effort the Turkish and Iranian 
officials have made to further improve and strengthen the 
relations between the two countries as much as possible.

  [Text] Tehran, May 6, IRNA -- Iran and South Africa are to 
resume bilateral relations from May 10 after 15 years of severed 
ties, following the historic victory of the black majority in 
the country's first multi-racial elections this week which put 
an end to apartheid and its racist policies. In a joint 
statement released simultaneously in Tehran and Johannesburg 
today, the two sides announced their readiness for resumption of 
ties after talks between South African Foreign Ministry 
officials and the Iranian interests section at the Swiss embassy 
in the South African capital. 
  In Tehran, a foreign ministry spokesman congratulated the 
South African nation on the victory of the African National 
Congress (ANC) which polled 66.9 percent of the votes counted. 
  Iran broke ties with South Africa after the triumph of the 
Islamic revolution in 1979. Switzerland had been looking after 
the interests of the two countries since then. Iran, which was 
South Africa's main oil supplier in the time of the defunct 
shah, stopped all oil supplies to the racist regime after the 
revolution. 
  Thereafter the Islamic Republic supported the South African 
people's struggle against racial discrimination and sided fully 
with liberation groups at international forums.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Following the victory of the African National 
Congress, ANC, in the all race elections and the dismantling of 
apartheid in South Africa, the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
South Africa have decided to officially resume diplomatic ties 
with effect from 10 May. The decision was announced in a joint 
communique which was released on Friday. 
  The two countries' decision about the resumption of 
political 
ties, which came following talks between officials of the South 
African Foreign Ministry and members of the office protecting 
the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran in that country, 
brings to an end a 15-year-old complete rupture of Iran's ties 
with South Africa. 
  Iran's ties with South Africa were severed following the 
victory of the Islamic revolution and in protest against that 
country's racist policies. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran cut off all economic and 
political ties with that country placing on top of its foreign 
policy priorities its support for the struggle of the South 
African nation for achieving independence. 
  The long and difficult struggle of the South African nation 
has finally brought to an end the more than three-century-old 
white domination over that country. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran, while welcoming the trend of 
return of peace, together with independence and restoration of 
the rights of the black majority, considers the recent 
developments in South Africa as being to the removal of 
obstacles in the way of establishing political and economic ties 
with that country and has announced its willingness for the 
resumption of full diplomatic ties with South Africa. [passage 
as received] 
  From a political point of view, the recent developments in 
South Africa, which have provided the ground for all the races 
to have direct and active participation in running the country's 
affairs and making political and economic decisions, are 
significant in that they can have positive impact and 
consequences within the foreign policy and regional framework 
for South Africa's future ties with other countries. 
  In this connection, the resumption of Islamic Republic of 
Iran's economic and political ties with South Africa, the 
groundwork of which was prepared during Mr. Mandela's visit to 
Tehran last January, is an appropriate response to the victory 
of the black majority in that country, and is a confirmation of 
the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has always and will 
continue to support the will of the nations in deciding about 
the own fate. 
  As the rupturing of ties with the South African apartheid 
regime 15 years ago and the resumption of ties with South Africa 
now indicate, Iran does not have the slightest doubt in making 
political decisions in this regard.

<F P=106> [Friday prayers sermon by His Eminence Ayatollah Mohammad </F>
Yazdi, head of the judiciary, in Tehran on 6 May--recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, and compassionate. 
Muslim brothers and sisters everywhere: A glance at the history 
of Islam shows that the results of pressure by Islam's enemies 
run counter to their expectations and serve to boost Islam's 
promotion and progress. And injustices have drawn people's 
attention to it. This is why Islam has made its way and assumed 
its position in the world. 
  The Karbala' incident took place in the first century of the 
hegira. This is the first proof of what we say. Then there 
were the crusades in the middle ages and today we have the 
Serbian crimes and their savage war and ethnic cleansing. 
  The other issue to which we draw the attention of the 
Islamic 
world is this: Had the events of Karbala' not occurred and the 
corrupt ruler not committed those crimes against the followers 
of the prophet, smearing the history of Islam, the world would 
not have needed an advocate of culture, freedom, democracy, and 
human rights. 
  The world, particularly Europe, today claims to be very 
civilized and to have progressed. But disregarding 
international organizations, the Serbians are committing the 
ugliest and most tragic crimes against the Muslims of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, including killing, torturing, burning, 
destroying, and slaughtering women, old people, and children. 
These acts shame humanity. Members of the United Nations and 
the Security Council have been turning a blind eye to these 
crimes and even supporting them in practice in a manner that 
pains the human conscience. What do you think? Is the result 
what the enemy wants or is it in favor of Islam? Islam is 
spreading against their will. 
  They usurped Palestine, displaced its people, and tortured 
and killed its people. What do you think will happen 
ultimately? Will the enemy achieve his objective or will he 
force the Muslims to get ready to regain their strength over 
their enemies? History shows that when the Muslims became aware 
of the reasons for their weakness and defeat and followed the 
path of struggle, they triumphed over the enemy. When they did 
not care what happened to them, they remained for years the 
prisoners of the enemy. 
  Muslim brothers and sisters: The conditions in the world 
today are not the same as before. We must today defeat the 
enemy through unity, new methods, and information. Meetings and 
decisions by officials are useless these days. The oppressed 
Bosnian and Palestinian peoples stood fast in the face of the 
Serbs and the Zionists. In doing so, they dealt a devastating 
blow to the United Nations and the Security Council. The 
Islamic Conference Organization intervened. Work is continuing 
secretly and openly. 
  'Arafat's treason and his recent signing of the disgraceful 
agreement in Egypt have escalated the wave of strikes and armed 
confrontation. General mourning was declared. The signing of 
the agreements in Washington and Cairo had no effect, thanks to 
the Palestinian resistance. This is the age of peoples, not 
governments. It is time to regain the people's rights and 
defend virtues, not time for laziness and indifference. We are 
confident that we will triumph ultimately, thanks to the 
vigilance and unity of the Muslims, God willing.

<F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad 'Ali </F>
Yazdi, head of the judiciary, in Tehran on 6 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. [passage omitted] In this sermon I have seven or 
eight issues to which I wish to refer. Time is short, and I will 
try to refer to them briefly in view of their importance. 
  First, I wish to thank the honorable deputies of the Majles, 
especially the members of the Judicial Committee of the Majles, 
for approving the bill concerning the general and revolutionary 
courts, as well as approving the bill which allows ladies to be 
employed within the judicial system in advisory positions if 
they possess the necessary qualifications. 
  As regards the first issue and the bill dealing with general 
and revolutionary courts, it was the realization of a 10 or 
15-year wish. We spent years working on it. Thanks be to God, 
it was recently approved by the Majles. The Guardian Council has 
also announced its final approval. The bill has been returned 
to the Majles and the Majles will, naturally, implement those 
amendments proposed by the Guardian Council within the next few 
sessions and will submit it to us for implementation. 
  The new system will make the procedure for court cases much 
shorter, it will eliminate many shortcomings, will involve 
direct submission to the judge, and will eliminate many 
conspiracies and plots which were hatched by the accused during 
the interval when the case was submitted by the prosecutor's 
office to the court and all the difficulties it gave rise to. 
It will also make many savings in time, in human resources and 
in procedure. This bill has many positive points and a great 
deal of expert work has been expended on it. [passage omitted] 
  The second issue is a form of praise and gratitude as well 
as 
being informative. Our country's honorable tribes have a 
particular and well known worth and value indicated in their 
life history, particularly in their defense of the country and 
its borders. Their pure and sincere beliefs, particularly in 
some parts of the country, regarding the family of the prophet 
is sometimes more intense than those of urban dwellers. 
[passage omitted] Unfortunately, there were, and are, 
traditions among them which clearly contradict religious and 
civil law. In our visit to Khuzestan we discussed the issue 
with senior officials and, thank God, significant steps were 
taken. I can now announce that there is cooperation among 
judicial, political, security and religious officials, as well 
as many people of influence and respect in the Khuzestan 
Province in the struggle against things contradicting religious 
and civil law, including the practices of Nahveh [meaning 
unknown], Fasl [meaning unknown], marriage of exchange [nekah-e 
sheghar], sharing of blood money [diyeh], and murders committed 
in the name of honor. It would not be wrong for me to say here 
that a father or a brother would kill his daughter, would then 
give himself up and say: I am the owner of blood and satisfied. 
And that would be the end of that. But we said this was not 
right. Although the Lord of the Universe has given the right to 
the owner of blood, it has also given a right to the government. 
Such practices violate the security of the system and the system 
can fight such fathers and brothers or cousins, who are 
mentioned in the prohibition debate. Extensive discussions and 
many meetings were held locally and in Tehran. Standing here 
today I can announce the good news that the good Khuzestan 
tribal leaders, in cooperation with senior officials, have 
signed pledges which were prepared. The simplest things do not 
significantly contradict religious law but might violate law and 
order -- things such as shooting during some of their 
celebrations. But from our point of view the sensitive issues 
are regarding obvious acts violating religious law, in 
particular, murders. There are things contradicting religious 
law in the division of blood money, judgment, prohibition, 
marriage of minors and other things. After the awareness of 
religious leaders influential among the tribes and the tribal 
leaders, and cooperation among all officials, we reached the 
point of a obtaining pledge to abandon such things. Should 
there be any violations, the security, intelligence, political 
and religious leaders are responsible for the transfer of the 
matter to the judicial body, and the judiciary is responsible 
for dealing severely with the matter. There were a couple of 
minor issues recently which were dealt with severely and which, 
thank God, have had positive result. I hope the good, pious and 
brave Khuzestan tribes defending our country are good examples 
for other tribes in other provinces of the country, and that we 
will not hear any violations of law among them. But I repeat 
that should there be any such things, the judiciary will not 
show the slightest mercy to any authority whatsoever. [audience 
chants approval] [passage omitted] 
  The atrocities that the Serbs perpetrated in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the methods that international 
authorities, the United Nations, the Security Council, 
adopted... [pauses] every day they witnessed new atrocities, 
but instead of embarking on actions which might stem them, they 
sometimes gave the green light; they sometimes even gave 
support. They imagine they can convince public opinion. In 
reality, it must be pointed out that their recent behavior has 
dealt the biggest blow to the reputation of the United Nations 
and the Security Council. That reputation will not be restored 
so soon. 
  We call on the Islamic Conference Organization to make even 
more effort than it has already done -- which is praiseworthy, 
especially the contact group -- and at least get to a point 
where the sanctions against the Muslim people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are lifted and the right of defense -- which 
is a natural right -- is given to them. 
  The people of our country have given much service and 
assistance. As the exalted leadership -- may God almighty assist 
and safeguard him -- has said, that is our duty. He even 
referred to all its aspects. In fairness, the people of Iran 
have given assistance and they will continue to give their 
assistance. We are sure that Islam will be victorious. 
[passage omitted] 
  The compromising accord between 'Arafat and the Zionists is 
best interpreted in the following way: Two individuals placing 
their signatures on a piece of paper, accompanied by false 
ceremonies, in a country which itself is beset by its own 
internal opponents and severe problems. Inviting several 
personalities and placing two signatures on a piece of paper in 
their presence cannot trample on the rights of a nation. 
  Mr 'Arafat is not the Palestinian nation. He cannot do 
whatever he wishes in the name of the Palestinian nation. We 
saw that when the accord was signed, a black day was declared; 
public mourning was declared; there was a call for a strike and 
the actions of opponents became more severe. We are certain 
that the combatant, brave, alive and awake people of our 
Palestine, especially the intifadah, will never be silent in the 
face of such policies of aliens, and they will continue their 
struggle until they regain their usurped lands and until rights 
have been restored to their rightful owners. [audience chants: 
"God is great," "Death to Israel," "Death to America"] 
  Please allow me; time is short and I have a couple of other 
topics to talk about and I do not want to keep you too long. 
South African combatants fought for almost 30 years against an 
inhumane regime that was senseless, unjust and even 
antireligious -- apartheid and racism. The combatants overcame 
a government which ruled that land, aided and abetted by the 
West, and headed by America. We all heard about Mr. Mandela's 
victory. [passage omitted] We formally congratulate the people 
of South Africa and Mr. Mandela and his colleagues on their 
liberation and independence. We tell them: You are aware that 
such victories are achieved at a high cost, and naturally they 
should be well protected. The protection of such victories 
needs a great deal more work than what was needed for their 
achievement. We can take advantage of this issue and tell the 
brave Muslim Palestinian combatants that today is the day of 
nations; today is the day of the people; today is the day of 
rallies and the expressing of the peoples' agreement and 
disagreements. Governments can no longer consolidate their 
authority through pressure, oppression and agreements and, as I 
said, signatures on a piece of paper. You see that when our 
country's struggles become victorious, when various struggles 
achieve victory in various parts of the world, and recently, the 
struggles in South Africa achieved victory, then such accords 
which may be signed should not make you despondent. You should 
be confident that those who struggle for their rights will 
sooner or later become victorious. 
  Fortunately, as you are aware, our country has formally 
announced the re-establishment of relations, relations which 
were established a few months ago through the African National 
Congress, and we intend to expand relations between the two 
countries. 
  Recently a certain European country, which claims to have 
mature policies -- Britain -- has claimed, as it were, that 
Iranian security officials had contacts with Irish combatants, 
that this and that has happened. I am not concerned with what 
they said. As the official responsible for the country's 
judiciary I say to Britain's statesmen: If you are telling the 
truth, or have anything to say, give us your evidence. We will 
investigate it, and if it is true we will deal with it. 
  Such political moves to poison the political atmosphere 
between the two countries, and in the region and the world, by 
relating a couple of false reports, are not worthy of a country 
which claims to have mature policies. Such actions are not 
proper. We are waiting to see if you have any proof to show us. 
  I had a few more things to say about the right of veto and 
other things relating to the judicial system, but since it is 
late and I have written a few lines in Arabic, with your 
permission, I will leave them for another time.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has stated that 
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will begin talks in Cairo 
next week on the points that are still the subject of 
disagreement, namely the stationing of a Palestinian policeman 
on the Allenby Bridge, the appointment of a Palestinian director 
for the Rafah crossing, the al-Mawasi area on the Khan Yunis 
beach, and the size of the Jericho area. This came at a news 
conference he held today to explain the details of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement which was signed by President 'Arafat and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo on 4 May. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that parallel to the talks on the points 
that are still the subject of disagreement between the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides, talks will also start on 
extending the Palestinian authority to the West Bank at an early 
date so that the Palestinian police will deploy in the West Bank 
towns to prepare for the Palestinian elections. He refused to 
set a date for these elections, indicating that, in accordance 
with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, they 
were supposed to take place on 13 July. However, in view of the 
delay in signing the agreement from April to 4 May, holding 
these elections in Gaza and the West Bank might be delayed . 
  Dr. Sha'th explained that President 'Arafat will deliver the 
list of the names of the members of the Palestinian authority to 
Israel on 11 May. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will 
also take place in Washington when the Arab-Israeli talks resume 
on the other tracks. The talks, which on the Palestinian side 
will be chaired by Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, will focus on the 
Palestinian legislative elections and the withdrawal from the 
West Bank. He added that talks will be held in Gaza and Jericho 
on the return of displaced people who left their homes after 
1967. He noted that the exact number of these displaced people 
is not known because of population growth over the past 27 years. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the first group from the Palestinian police 
force consisting of 360 policemen and officers left for Rafah 
today. He added that 1,500 policemen will cross the Jordan 
River to Jericho tomorrow. He said more Palestinian policemen 
will continue to arrive in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, 
indicating that the PLO will adhere to the timetable mentioned 
in the agreement, namely one to three weeks to establish 
security control in the autonomous areas in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Dr. Sha'th noted that the Palestinian forces in Yemen today 
began moving overland to Najran in Saudi Arabia in view of the 
circumstances in Yemen and the closure of airports. He said 
Saudi planes will fly them to Cairo. From there they will move 
to their assembly point in Rafah. The Palestinian forces in 
Libya have also moved overland to Cairo and from there to their 
assembly point in Rafah. The Palestinian forces in Algeria will 
also move to Egypt and then to the assembly point in Rafah. 
  Dr. Sha'th said Maj. Gen. Nasr Yusuf has been appointed 
commander in chief of the Palestinian police force. Ziyad 
al-Atrash has been appointed representative of the Palestinian 
side on the Palestinian-Israeli Coordination Committee. 
Al-Atrash arrived in Gaza yesterday. Brig. Gen. Ghazi 
al-Jabali has been appointed police commander of the Gaza Strip. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the interim period will begin on 4 May 1994, 
the date of the signing of the agreement. He indicated that a 
general amnesty will be issued for all prisoners and detainees 
when agreement on the interim period is reached. He added that 
no detainee will make a pledge to adhere to the accord. The 
pledge will be given to the Palestinian authority and not 
Israel; it will be a pledge to adhere to what the authority 
adheres to. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th said the agreement signed in Cairo 
Wednesday was the best possible agreement under the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed in 
Washington on 13 September. He noted that the Declaration 
postponed discussion of main issues such as Israeli settlements, 
Jerusalem, Israeli withdrawal, border protection, and the return 
of the refugees. 
  He said the Palestinian National Authority, as it was agreed 
to call it, will be responsible for implementing what has been 
agreed upon. This authority, he added, will not have the right 
to exercise international powers, and countries cannot, for 
example, open embassies in the self-rule areas, but they may 
have representation offices in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Sha'th said the PLO outside will have the right to open 
embassies because the Palestine National Council had announced 
the establishment of a Palestinian state. 
  Concerning the structure of the Palestinian National 
Authority, Dr. Sha'th explained at the end of his news 
conference that a 24-member council will assume legislative and 
executive powers. The judicial power, he added, will be 
exercised by appointed judges that cannot be dismissed, in 
accordance with the familiar norms in this regard. 
  Sha'th said the Palestinian negotiator managed to regain an 
important part of his rights within the framework of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  He stressed that the Palestinians will continue the 
negotiations until they attain all their rights to 
self-determination, the establishment of the Palestinian state, 
and repatriation. 
  He emphasized that the Palestinians will respect all their 
obligations and will work for a just and genuine peace.

  [Text] Jeddah, May 8, SPA -- The Organization of the 
Islamic Conference (OIC) [ICO] has expressed grave concern over 
the serious escalation of the situation in the Republic of 
Yemen, especially the recent incidents in many provinces which 
have killed and wounded a large number of people. 
  In a statement issued Saturday [7 May], the OIC expressed 
hope that usual stability and cordiality among the people of 
Yemen would be restored, differences would be discarded and 
efforts would be exerted to confirm their unity and resort to 
dialogue and understanding rather than violence and fighting. 
  The OIC called on the leaders and people of Yemen to show 
restraint and remain committed to their firm belief and wisdom 
and work together for the progress of Yemen and the protection 
of its immortal civilization. 
  OIC Secretary General Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid called on Yemeni 
leaders, ulemas and politicians to work as one for the best 
interests of the country. 
  He asked them to find points of agreement and reduce points 
of disagreement and withdraw massed troops separating brothers 
to their previous positions. 
  Dr. al-Ghabid once again confirmed the OIC's readiness to 
exert good Islamic offices and mediation efforts out of its 
Islamic duty and in conformity with the principles of Islam.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--The vanguards of the 
Palestinian police and security forces left 'Ayn Jalut 
Palestinian forces' camp in Cairo for Rafah this morning as they 
prepare to enter the Gaza Strip within the next 48 hours. The 
forces will take charge of their tasks within the framework of 
the Palestinian National Authority. 
  These vanguards include some 1,000 people, mostly young men 
between 16 and 26 years old who live in Egypt and Sudan, 
although their families still reside in Gaza. 
  The Palestinian troops boarded buses bearing the picture of 
Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. They waved their 
Palestinian flags and chanted patriotic Palestinian songs. 
  Major General Yusuf Nasr, commander of the Palestinian 
security forces in Gaza and Jericho, stated that the troops are 
expected to enter the Gaza Strip on Sunday or Monday. 
  Major General Yusuf Nasr affirmed that the Palestinian 
forces will complete their deployment in Gaza and the area of 
Jericho within 14 days, in accordance with the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement signed in Cairo. The agreement 
provides for completing the Israeli troop withdrawal and their 
replacement with Palestinian troops within 14 days of 4 May. 
  He added that Palestinian security and police forces 
arriving 
from Iraq and Jordan will head for Jericho tomorrow via the 
Allenby Bridge over the Jordan River to take over their tasks as 
soon as possible. He added that the security and police forces 
will be equipped with personal weapons, automatic rifles and 
pistols, in addition to light- and medium-machine guns. 
  Maj. Gen. Nasr pointed out that much of the assistance 
promised by various states has not arrived. Only 25 vehicles 
donated by the United States have arrived, he said, adding that 
an additional 175 vehicles will arrive on 15 May. He also said 
that a shipment of police uniforms has arrived from Sweden. 
  He noted that the troops going to Gaza today are 
self-equipped and are not reliant on foreign assistance. He 
added that a number of police stations in Gaza can absorb the 
first batch of Palestinian forces. We will need more centers 
and stations in coming days, he said. 
  Maj. Gen. Nasr pointed out that the Gaza Strip and Jericho 
area will need stability, reconstruction, and security in the 
future and there is no time for disputes among citizens of 
different political backgrounds. We believe in democracy and in 
every citizen's right to express himself, and we will cooperate 
with everyone, he said. 
  He added that the Palestinian security forces have developed 
a specific program to handle the problem of collecting arms from 
Gaza's citizens, but he refrained from revealing it. 
  Marwan Kanafani, adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, has told MENA that the Palestinian troops will enter 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho as soon as they are allowed to. He 
explained that the Palestinians want to complete this task 
quietly and safely. 
  He noted that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin had 
stated 
that the Palestinian troops were not prepared to enter Gaza and 
Jericho. This is not true, he said, because the 9,000 troops 
will complete their entry in just 14 days. 
  He noted that the majority of these troops have never seen 
the Palestinian land, but that the homeland is in their hearts. 
  He affirmed that the Palestinian side is prepared to put 
forward new working papers and ideas when the Palestinian and 
Israeli negotiators get together to find a solution to a number 
of issues, such as the area of Jericho, the crossing points, 
Gaza's coastline, and others. He pointed out that the 
Palestinians base their work on ending the occupation. 
Therefore, he said, ideas will be put forward to achieve this 
goal. 
  Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Hayy 'Abd-al-Wahid, commander of 
the Palestinian 'Ayn Jalut forces in Egypt, gave a speech to the 
Palestinian police and security forces in which he said that 
this is the moment Palestinians have been awaiting for over 27 
years. You have to carry out the tasks you have been entrusted 
with in order to build our state and safeguard the homeland's 
security, he said, noting that the Palestinians have made great 
sacrifices for this moment. 
  He thanked the Egyptian Armed Forces for training these 
troops and the Egyptian people and President Mubarak for their 
support for the Palestinian people and cause. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, May 8 (AFP) -- The 
Palestinian police deployment in the Gaza Strip, scheduled to 
start on Sunday [8 May], has been delayed again, Palestinian 
sources said here late Saturday. 
  They said "technical reasons" were to blame for the delay in 
the arrival of hundreds of policemen from the Rafah border 
crossing with Egypt, but declined to elaborate. 
  Some 300 policemen left Cairo for the Rafah crossing earlier 
Saturday, a day after Palestinian general Ziyad al-Atrash 
announced here that the Gaza deployment would start Sunday after 
a delay of several days. 
  But Palestinian officials in Amman, meanwhile, said hundreds 
more policemen were to cross Sunday from Jordan into the West 
Bank for deployment in the other self-rule area, Jericho. 
  However, the Israeli news agency ITIM said no deployment was 
expected in Jericho Sunday as the Palestinians had failed to 
coordinate their arrival with the Israeli army, it said. 
  The police were due to arrive in Gaza, ITIM said, quoting 
military sources. 
  Under the autonomy deal signed Wednesday between the PLO and 
Israel, 9,000 Palestinian policemen are to be deployed in 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip to take charge of security as the 
Israeli army pulls out. 
  However General Dany Rothschild, coordinator of Israeli 
activities in the occupied territories, complained Saturday that 
the Palestinians were not ready to take over their new 
responsibilities. 
  "If the transfer of civilian powers in the autonomous zones 
does not take place in an orderly fashion, the situation on the 
ground will deteriorate," he said. "We still don't have anybody 
to hand these powers to." 
  He detected a change in the Palestinian stand. 
  "Up until a few days ago, the word from them was: `Give us 
the keys and leave. We'll sort it out.' Their calls for help 
are now more frequent and they're starting to realize the size 
of the task," said the general. 
  On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is to 
present the self-rule accord he signed last week with PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat for parliament's approval on Wednesday, 
parliamentary sources said.

  [Excerpts] AL-RA'Y -- Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali has said that the Palestinian brothers achieved a 
major step in Cairo. [passage omitted] This came in a joint 
news conference held at the Prime Ministry yesterday by Prime 
Minister Dr. al-Majali and Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi at the conclusion of the meetings of the Joint 
Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee. [passage omitted] 
  Asked about Egyptian-Palestinian relations and the news 
reports that Egypt should first approve of any Palestinian 
decision before it is announced, Dr. Sidqi denied these reports, 
saying: Egypt places itself, its resources, and its experience 
at the disposal of any Arab country. Therefore, it is natural 
to place our resources and experience at the disposal of the 
Palestinians, particularly the PLO. 
  Dr. Sidqi added: However, it is incorrect to say that no 
Palestinian decisions are made without referring to Egypt. 
Palestinian decisions are made by the Palestinians themselves. 
We only help and express our opinions, which are sometimes 
taken into consideration and sometimes not. We have never 
imposed anything on the PLO since the time it was recognized as 
the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people 
inside and outside [the occupied territory]. 
  Dr. Sidqi indicated that Egypt has been maintaining good 
relations with the PLO for a long time. He said: Relations 
between us and the PLO have never been completely severed. Even 
during times of disagreement, contacts were held. The Palestine 
question is the heart of the Middle East issue. Therefore, it 
is in our common interest that we hold almost daily talks and 
consultations. [passage omitted] 
  In response to a question on whether Jordan has asked Egypt 
to intervene with the United States to lift the al-'Aqabah 
siege, Dr. Sidqi said: There is no mediation in this regard. 
  He added: We do, however, welcome the recent developments 
aimed at finding a solution to this problem because it harms 
Jordan. Egypt is ready to intervene and mediate should the need 
arise. However, the current proposals respond to most of 
Jordan's wishes and legitimate demands. This fact is supported 
by Egypt. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The talks between the prime minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, and the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, on the 
19th of this month in Washington are expected to cover a wide 
range of bilateral and international issues. While stating 
this, the External Affairs Ministry spokesman said in New Delhi 
today that substantial preparations are being made to make the 
visit successful. He said the visit will lead to enhanced 
cooperation between the two countries. Denying reports in a 
section of the press about the reported ultimatum or 
preconditions being laid down by the USA for the visit of the 
prime minister, the spokesman said the report is full of errors 
and distortions.

  [Text] Beirut, 8 May (MENA)--Semi-official Lebanese 
sources have stated that Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has 
decided to stay home and to refrain from doing his work in what 
these sources have described as a political stance and not a 
constitutional one. No official statement has yet been issued 
by the prime minister on the reasons for his decision to remain 
at home. However, informed sources have told the MENA 
correspondent that Prime Minister al-Hariri is facing 
difficulties in reshuffling his cabinet with a view to improving 
the chances of Christian representation in the Lebanese 
Government to remedy the frustration felt by the Christians in 
Lebanon. 
  The sources said al-Hariri's decision does not mean he will 
resign. The MENA correspondent says several ministers, as well 
as political, religious, and military figures, including Army 
Commander Gen. Emile Lahhud, have visited al-Hariri at his 
mansion in the Quraytim area of Beirut to ask him to change his 
mind. 
  Informed sources in Beirut say al-Hariri's decision to stop 
doing his job has moved what could be considered a cabinet 
crisis into the Lebanese streets. In the past few days there 
has been a lot of speculation in the press and in political 
quarters about an imminent cabinet reshuffle to include some 
Christian political figures in the government, such as 
Phalangist Party leader Dr. George Sa'adah, plus a member from 
the National Liberal Party and other Christian figures. 
  The situation is still vague regarding the fate of the 
Lebanese Government. Prime Minister al-Hariri canceled a radio 
and television interview that was scheduled to be aired live 
tonight, in which he would have addressed questions and 
speculations about a possible cabinet reshuffle.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, has called on the separatist 
elements in the leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], 
who are rebelling against legitimacy, to immediately surrender 
to legitimacy to preserve the remainder of the Armed Forces 
personnel, who were misled by those separatist elements into a 
losing battle. The brother chairman regretted the victims of 
the ongoing fighting against the rebels in the YSP leadership. 
He said that the blood that was shed is Yemeni blood and dear 
to all of us. 
  Addressing the people's deputies at the House of 
Representatives this morning, the brother chairman said: Our 
Yemeni people, who offered thousands of martyrs to defend the 
republican system, will offer more sacrifices to maintain unity. 
He said: Separation is impossible. We will not move an inch 
from unity, regardless of the price. 
  The brother chairman announced the rejection of any 
mediation 
effort or call aimed at bringing into our country any Arab or 
international forces. He said: What is taking place in Yemen 
is an internal affair and an issue that concerns the Yemenis. 
We are not two states or two regimes, but one state, one 
people, and one republican system. The ongoing fighting is 
taking place against Yemeni elements who fomented sedition in 
the society and rebelled against the constitutional legitimacy. 
They bear responsibility for their acts and mistakes. But, as 
for the unionists in the YSP, they are the object of our 
respect, pride, and love. 
  He added: Our unionist enterprise is to build a new Yemen on 
the basis of a democratic and multi-party political system, 
where the constitution and law are enforced. We want to build 
the state of law and order, social progress, and of genuine, 
comprehensive progress, away from flowery speeches, slogans, 
lies, and deception. 
  He indicated that our valiant Armed Forces are now scoring 
major successes and chasing the forces of rebellion and 
secession to force them to surrender to the people's will, 
legitimacy, and national consensus. 
  The brother chairman urged the House of Representatives, and 
through it the masses of our Yemeni people, to maintain public 
order, abide by the law, and prevent chaos. He said: We highly 
appreciate our great Yemeni people's endurance and patience, 
which has lasted for a period of approximately nine months since 
the beginning of the political crisis fabricated by the 
secessionists in the YSP leadership when al-Bid returned to 
Aden. Relaxation is imminent. The outcome will be favorable, 
God willing. 
  In his address to the House of Representatives, the brother 
president reviewed all the developments that have taken place in 
our country since the fabrication of the crisis on 19 August 
1993. He also reviewed the role that the separatist elements in 
the YSP leadership under al-Bid had in leading the country to 
the current regrettable situation. He described the concessions 
that have been made to end the crisis, maintain unity, and spare 
the people and the homeland problems, troubles, and affliction. 
  The president said: However, the secessionist elements in 
the YSP continued to work to escalate the crisis and promote its 
repercussions in the military and information spheres. These 
elements brought the military situation to a head beginning with 
the Abyan events on the eve of the signing of the Pledge and 
Accord Agreement in Amman; through the Shabwah, (Harth Sufyan), 
and 'Imran events; and finally igniting the fire in Dhamar with 
the Ba Suhayb Brigade and against the Central Security men in 
Aden and the 2d Armored Brigade at al-Rahah. 
  The president said: We did not want matters to go this far, 
but the rebellious secessionist elements continued to be 
arrogant and intransigent, working to provoke sedition and bring 
conditions all over the homeland to the point of explosion. 
  The president alluded to the YSP secessionist elements' 
crimes of plundering public funds and of financial and 
administrative corruption, noting actions by Salih Abu-Bakr 
Bin-Husaynun and a number of other secessionist elements from 
the YSP leadership who took $375 million from the al-Masilah oil 
revenues illegally and deposited them in private accounts of 
their own after having doubled the price of the construction of 
the al-Masilah oil pipeline in an illegal way and without 
consulting constitutional establishments. 
  The brother president reviewed the development of the 
crisis, 
alluding to the dialogues following the parliamentary election 
on constitutional amendments and the YSP demands to improve the 
drafting of some articles in the draft amendments concerning the 
form of the state presidency, the local government, and the 
third article of the constitution. However, [word indistinct] 
imposed new conditions represented by [word indistinct] draft 
that was agreed on. We accepted the political dialogue and the 
Pledge and Accord Document was completed. We accepted this in 
order to prevent the implementation of the plot to dismember the 
homeland, despite the fact that it contained 75 percent of the 
YSP demands. However, the YSP was not convinced. The 
secessionist elements continued to implement their scheme of 
returning the homeland to what it was before 22 May 1990. They 
continued to present impossible conditions and refused to accept 
any mediation efforts. We said: Let us begin with the two 
basic points in the Pledge and Accord Document; namely, 
arresting elements accused of sabotage and disturbing security, 
and withdrawing military units from the previous borders. 
  The president said: But they rejected this. Then we 
discovered that their demands were only a cover to circumvent 
the results of the parliamentary elections and implement the 
plot of secession. This was proven by the fact that elements 
accused of sabotage and explosions, whose names were placed on 
the list of of persons to be arrested, were in alliance with the 
YSP and were fighting among its ranks, paying them money and 
giving them arms to practice deception. 
  The explosions, the kidnapping of foreigners, and the 
banditry have been revealed to be the work of the intelligence 
forces of the YSP in order to terrify unionist elements in the 
party and force them to leave Sanaa in order to implement the 
secessionist plot for which al-Bid had been working. He 
continued to escalate the crisis after reaping the fruits of the 
crisis. 
  The brother chairman of the Presidential Council added that 
after the elections, the YSP was offered many concessions to 
participate in assuming power, despite the fact that it came in 
third. He pointed out that the YSP continued to practice media 
deception and kept harping on a state of law and order, at a 
time when large amounts of weapons were found at the 
headquarters of the Central Committee in Sanaa. The weapons 
included more than 400 pieces of equipment, 350 RPG's, and [word 
indistinct] missiles, and other weapons. This is the cultural 
scheme of the YSP. 
  The brother chairman added that what happened in 'Imran was 
part of a series of incidents meant to ignite the military 
situation in order to destroy the 1st Armored Brigade and then 
destroy the city of 'Imran and march on Sanaa to topple the 
regime of the state of unity and constitutional legitimacy. He 
pointed out that the martyrs and victims who fell in that 
regrettable fighting are the victims of the policy of the 
elements that have not learned their lesson since the inception 
of the YSP. 
  Brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the 
House of Representatives, earlier welcomed brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, 
commending his attendance of the House's session to brief the 
House on the facts since the inception of the crisis. 
  The House discussed the latest developments in the country. 
The discussions of the deputies of the people, including the 
deputies attending for the parliamentary bloc of the YSP, 
asserted that the members of the House represent the entire 
Yemeni people in accordance with the Constitution and the 
constitutional oath taken by the deputies at the first session 
of the elected House of Representatives. 
  The people's deputies, of various political and party 
persuasions, stressed adherence to constitutional legitimacy and 
Yemeni unity and national unity, at whatever cost. The deputies 
were also unanimous that they are against those who undermine 
the democratic approach and against those who seek separation. 
  The House of Representatives also stressed that the current 
war is not a civil war but a war between constitutional 
legitimacy and those who have abrogated it. The deputies' 
remarks also stressed that it is important for the security 
agencies to maintain public security and safeguard public and 
private funds and the safety of the citizens, regardless of 
their political persuasion. 
  Afterward, the House formed a committee from its members, 
including the bloc of the General People's Congress, the YSP 
bloc, the Yemeni Reform Grouping bloc and the bloc of the 
independents. The committee will present views to the House on 
the current developments in the country. 
  At the outset of the session, the House of Representatives 
reviewed the minutes of its previous session, to which the House 
statement issued on 5 May 1994 is attached. The two were 
approved unanimously. The House of Representatives will resume 
its sessions tomorrow morning, God willing.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)-- President Husni Mubarak has 
stated that his talks with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel 
today focused on bilateral ties and cooperation, particularly in 
the field of joint ventures, banks, trade, and tourism. 
  The president said at a news conference he held with 
President Demirel this afternoon that the talks also dealt with 
various topical issues in the Arab region, in addition to 
international issues. 
  Commenting on developments in Yemen, President Mubarak 
affirmed that there is absolutely no plan to send Arab troops to 
Yemen, noting that he warned the Yemeni president and his vice 
president before the fighting erupted. He said that the 
Egyptian Foreign Ministry had previously addressed appeals to 
the Yemeni parties in this connection. 
  President Mubarak remarked that it is the entire Yemeni 
people who will suffer from that fighting. 
  Touching on Egyptian-Turkish bilateral issues, Mubarak noted 
that the joint higher committee involving the two countries will 
meet in June or July to discuss scopes of cooperation in detail. 
  Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that his visit to 
Egypt reaffirms the deep ties that have linked the two 
countries. He said that Egypt and Turkey are major regional 
states and that they both seek to bring about peace and 
stability in the region to serve the people's interests. 
  Demirel added that he congratulated President Mubarak on the 
signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement on autonomy in Gaza 
and Jericho in Cairo last Wednesday. He remarked that the 
Egyptian policy in this context is consistently successful. 
  Touching on the economic embargo on Iraq and its impact on 
Turkey, and whether he had discussed this issue with President 
Mubarak, Demirel said: The issue was raised during the talks. 
He pointed out that the international community is not prepared 
to do anything to lift that embargo at present. 
  President Mubarak opened the news conference with a speech 
in which he welcomed the Turkish president to Egypt. He said: 
We made it a habit to meet every once in a while to exchange 
views on hot issues and those of common interest in the Middle 
East, as well as other issues like Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Mubarak added: We focused in our talks on bilateral 
relations and discussed many issues in this context. The 
president noted that a businessmen's delegation will visit 
Istanbul in June. He also said that they agreed to hold a 
meeting of the joint Egyptian-Turkish higher committee in June 
or July to be cochaired by the prime ministers of both countries 
to discuss bilateral agreements. We consider these agreements 
very important because we think of Turkey as a major and central 
regional state and we want to maintain strong and good ties with 
it, Mubarak said. 
  President Demirel then delivered a speech in which he 
thanked 
President Mubarak and said: It is my pleasure to visit Egypt as 
a guest of my dear brother President Husni Mubarak. I feel I am 
in my home in this great country because the close ties between 
Egypt and Turkey are built on foundations of a common cultural 
and historical heritage. 
  He said those bonds strengthen fraternal relations between 
the peoples of Egypt and Turkey. He said every high-level visit 
between the two countries prove the depth of bilateral 
relations. He said the two countries, which he described as 
crossroads for several continents, have common political 
objectives. 
  President Demirel said Egypt and Turkey are trying to 
achieve 
economic development while sparing no effort to help bring about 
peace and stability in their common region. 
  He added: During our talks today, our exchange of viewpoints 
was fruitful. We reviewed all aspects of bilateral cooperation 
and stressed during the talks that there is not any difference 
in our views toward political issues. 
  Demirel went on: We agreed that the relations of economic 
cooperation between Egypt and Turkey need further efforts and 
support to match the strong political relations between us. 
  He stressed that stronger cooperation will reflect 
positively 
on the peoples of the whole region. He explained that Egypt and 
Turkey are the biggest countries in the region, and they both 
feel they are responsible for the region's peace and stability. 
  President Demirel said that he and President Mubarak 
discussed several regional problems and reviewed the situation 
in the Balkans and in the Caucasus. The former Soviet Union is 
being restructured and we are interested in such matters because 
they affect both Egypt and Turkey. 
  President Demirel said he was pleased with his meeting with 
President Mubarak. He added: I congratulated President Mubarak 
on the success of his efforts, which were rewarded by the 
signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement in Cairo. I also 
told him that he should consider the signing of this agreement 
his birthday present. 
  The Turkish president expressed hope that the 50-year-old 
Middle East conflict will come to an end and that a new vista of 
opportunity will open for Egyptian-Turkish cooperation. He said 
that the two countries should walk "hand in hand" toward a new 
horizon of peace and prosperity in the region. 
  The two leaders then fielded questions by journalists. 
  Answering a question on the events in Yemen, President 
Mubarak said: "I wish to make it clear that we warned the Yemeni 
president of the implications of the Yemeni crisis, even before 
the fighting started. I told the Yemenis that their troops are 
deployed close to each other and that unless they separate them, 
fighting may break out and will be hard to stop. They did not 
listen." 
  I sent several appeals to the Yemeni president and the 
Egyptian Foreign Ministry did the same, Mubarak said. I told 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih: "It would be wise if you 
separate the troops and try to calm down the situation. You 
have to sit together and work out your differences. Otherwise, 
the entire Yemeni people will suffer." 
  President Mubarak added: "Fighting then erupted in Yemen. 
They are exchanging shells and accusations. They bombarded 
each other's airports." 
  The Arab League is today meeting at the level of 
representatives, Mubarak said. He added: I do not think that 
there are any plans to send Arab forces to Yemen. Newspaper 
reports to this effect do not match reality. I think that all 
the Arab League can do is appeal for an end to the fighting and 
for a peaceful solution that would enable the Yemenis to go on 
with their lives. The current fighting is a loss for all 
Yemenis, Mubarak stated. 
  Answering a question on Egyptian-Turkish cooperation, 
Mubarak 
said: We have discussed several areas of cooperation, including 
tourism, but I do not wish to go into detail. The Higher 
Egyptian-Turkish Committee, which is cochaired by the two prime 
ministers, will discuss various aspects of cooperation, such as 
joint projects and banking agreements. Mubarak pointed out that 
his talks with Demirel touched on trade, friendship agreements, 
and the formation of a committee on tourism. 
  A journalist asked Mubarak if there had been progress 
concerning the proposal Mubarak made during his visit to Turkey 
in February concerning Egyptian-Turkish-Saudi cooperation. 
Mubarak answered by saying: Let us begin with Egyptian-Turkish 
cooperation. If another country wishes to join us, it is up to 
that country to make its wishes known. 
  Asked whether Turkey can play a role in the Middle East 
peace process, President Mubarak said: I would not specify 
precisely this role. However, I can frankly say that Turkey is 
a strong state in the region and so is Egypt. Turkey is a very 
important state in the Middle East. 
  Asked whether he had discussed with the Turkish president 
regional cooperation in fighting terrorism, President Mubarak 
said: We discussed this topic. The two countries' foreign 
ministers will discuss the kind of cooperation that can exist 
between the two countries in this domain, in addition to 
discussing the possibility of other countries joining this 
cooperation. We will do this quietly in the beginning to see 
what this cooperation will produce. 
  Asked whether he discussed with President Mubarak the 
economic embargo imposed on Iraq and its effect on Turkey, 
President Demirel said: We discussed this topic but did not go 
into detail. As you know, the international community and the 
alliance (formed during the Gulf War) are very sensitive about 
the Gulf war and Iraq's stand. In my personal opinion, it is 
[not further identified] against these sanctions. However, the 
international community is not prepared to do anything in this 
respect. Demirel said: The sanctions have harmed the Iraqi 
people, not just the Iraqi president. 
  Asked about his concept of cooperation between Egypt and 
Turkey to confront terrorism in the region, Demirel said: 
Cooperation between Egypt and Turkey is excellent and there are 
no problems. What we discussed today and what we will discuss in 
the future will be beneficial for the Egyptian and Turkish 
peoples. 
  Commenting on Demirel's remarks, President Mubarak said: We 
are anxious to have good cooperation between Egypt and Turkey in 
all domains.

  [Text] Tehran, May 6, IRNA -- The Islamic Republic last 
night condemned the American officials' mistreatment of Iranian 
delegation to the joint spring session of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in Washington on April 
22. 
  The Iranian interests section in Washington in a 
strongly-worded letter to the U.S. foreign affairs department 
through the Pakistani embassy, described as "insulting" the way 
customs officials at Washington airport behaved with Iranian 
Minister of Economy and Finance Morteza Mohammad-Khani and 
Governor of Central Bank Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli. 
  The U.S. Customs officials stopped the two senior Iranian 
diplomats, re-checked their suitcases and took photographs from 
them. 
  The letter voicing dissatisfaction, said the treatment not 
only violated the basic diplomatic principles but contradicted 
the U.S. Government's responsibility towards international 
organizations based in America. 
  It continued that U.S. Customs officials had repeatedly 
shown 
such disrespect for Iranian officials visiting America for 
international sessions. 
  The letter expected that the U.S. as a country which hosts 
international sessions would put an end to such practice.

  [Text] Gaza -- Attorney Khalid al-Qidrah, head of the 
Cairo talks Legal Committee, has said that it has been agreed 
that all Palestinians who were registered in the Gaza Strip, the 
Jericho area, and the West Bank up to 4 June 1967 will be 
repatriated to their homeland and families. 
  Al-Qidrah said that the agreement does not include only 
those 
who resided in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after the 
occupation and emigrated, but also those who lived there before 
the occupation. Agreement has been reached on the repatriation 
of these Palestinians as well. 
  Al-Qidrah noted that if a resident of the Gaza Strip or 
Jericho was traveling, studying, or employed abroad when the 
occupation took place, he has the right to return in accordance 
with the Declaration of Principles accord signed on 13 September. 
  Al-Qidrah said that talks over the timetable of this 
repatriation will be held within the coming days.

  [Text] AKHIR KHABAR accompanied the Palestinian police 
unit affiliated with the Badr Brigade, which arrived at King 
Husayn Bridge this morning on its way to the Jericho area. 
  The unit's 270 members, each armed with a Kalashnikov, were 
transported by bus. 
  Well-informed Palestinian sources in Amman said that Jordan 
will arm the Palestinian police force affiliated with al-Aqsa 
Brigade, which will arrive from Iraq within the next two days. 
This force will be supplied with cars, equipment, and weapons 
at the Pilgrims' City in Wadi Nimrin near al-Shunah al-Janubiyah. 
  The sources told AKHIR KHABAR that the Iraqi Government 
prevented the Palestinian forces from taking their weapons and 
equipment with them. It allowed them to leave their camps in 
Iraqi territory for the Jordanian border post at al-Ruwayshid 
with only their personal belongings. This forced President 
Yasir 'Arafat, during his recent visit to Jordan, to ask His 
Majesty King Husayn to arm these forces in Jordan. For his 
part, his majesty showed a willingness to supply the weapons 
these forces asked for, allowing them to choose the kind of 
weapons they wanted; that is, the Western M16, or the Eastern 
Kalazhnikov. 'Arafat asked for Kalashnikovs. 
  AKHIR KHABAR also learned that Palestinian officials in 
Amman 
will buy cars and other equipment from the Free Zone [in 
al-Zarqa'] within the next two days in order to equip these 
forces. 
  The Palestinian sources said that this has led to a change 
in 
arrangements in terms of the forces' entry into Jericho. The 
al-Aqsa forces stationed in Iraq were supposed to enter the 
Jericho area via the King Husayn Bridge only one day after the 
signing of the Cairo accord. However, the forces affiliated to 
Badr Brigade, stationed in Jordan, entered Jericho instead.

  [Text] The first group from the al-Aqsa forces of the 
Palestine Liberation Army stationed on Iraqi territory arrived 
at the border post of al-Karamah-al-Ruwayshid this morning en 
route to the occupied territories. This group is composed of 
600 officers, non-commissioned officers, and other ranks. 
  Palestinian Ambassador in Amman al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim said 
these forces' entry at the al-Ruwayshid border post came at the 
request of the Palestinian leadership. His Majesty King Husayn 
ordered that all necessary facilities be provided to these 
forces during their stay on Jordanian territory, and that they 
be treated as the guests of the Jordanian Armed Forces, which 
will equip and arm them. 
  In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, the ambassador 
added that both Jordan's permission for this group to enter 
Jordanian territory and the provision of the necessary 
assistance to them are definitive proof of the true and profound 
fraternity between the sisterly Jordanian and Palestinian 
peoples and their common fate. Moreover, this confirms the 
eagerness of the Hashemite leadership, represented by His 
Majesty King Husayn, to enable the sons of the Palestinian 
people to achieve their national objectives on their national 
soil under the leadership of the PLO. 
  This group was welcomed by representatives from the 
Jordanian 
Armed Forces and by the Palestinian military attache at the 
Palestinian Embassy in Amman. 
  In another development, 'Abd-al-Rahim said the Palestinian 
police forces' entry into Gaza and Jericho areas is linked to 
the announcment of the formation of the Palestinian national 
authority. The Palestinian leadership is continuing its meetings 
in the Tunisian capital to officially form this authority, he 
added. 
  The Palestinian ambassador attributed the delay in the 
Palestinian police forces' entry into Gaza and Jericho areas 
today to technical reasons linked to the Israeli procedures 
concerning these forces' weapons. He explained that contacts 
are continuing in this regard between the heads of the 
Palestinian and Israeli negotiating delegations, Sha'th and 
Shahaq.

  [Text] Tunis, 8 May (MENA)--The PLO Executive Committee met 
today chaired by Yasir 'Arafat to continue discussing the 
formation of the National Authority Council, the body that will 
assume the responsibility of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho 
following Israeli withdrawal. 
  PLO Executive Committee Member Samir Ghawshah said that 
Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), Faruq Qaddumi, Jamal al-Surani, 
Sulayman al-Najjab, and he himself declined to participate in 
the Council. 
  Ghawshah disclosed that he is seeking clarification from 
'Arafat concerning the Council's mode of operation, 'Arafat's 
leadership style, and the relation between the PLO Executive 
Committee and the Council, before he decides whether to 
participate in the council. 
  Ghawshah pointed out that Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and Muhammad 
Zuhdi al-Nashashibi have both asked for some time to think about 
participating in the Council. Yasir 'Amr and Juwayd al-Ghusayn 
have agreed to participate in the Council. Dr. Haydar 
'Abd-al-Shafi, former head of the Palestinian negotiating 
delegation, and Mahir al-Misri, a prominent figure in Nabulus, 
have both refused to take part in the Council. 
  There is a consensus among Palestinian officials inside and 
outside the homeland not to take part in the Council until they 
are offered clarification about the Council's operating 
procedure and guarantees that 'Arafat will not be the sole 
decision-maker. These officials also call for a clear definition 
of the relation between the PLO Executive Committee and the 
Council. They believe that the PLO Executive Committee should 
control the Council that it will form and retain the authority 
to shape Palestinian policy, Ghawshah declared. 
  A committee formed of Faruq Qaddumi, Abu-Mazin and Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh will get in touch with Palestinian figures at home 
and abroad to explore the conditions under which they would be 
willing to participate in the National Authority Council and 
ascertain their opinion concerning the Council's mode of 
operation.

<F P=106> [Rashid Khashanah report: "Palestinian Officials' </F>
Reservations Delay Announcement of National Authority Formation"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- The [PLO] Executive Committee failed to 
agree at its third meeting in Tunis yesterday on forming the 
Palestinian authority because of reservations expressed by many 
of its members and figures from inside the occupied territories 
about the way in which President 'Arafat ran the consultations 
on forming the authority. 
  President 'Arafat departed Tunis for South Africa at noon 
yesterday after agreeing with Executive Committee members to 
resume the meeting Wednesday morning -- which means postponing 
the handover of powers to the Palestinian authority. 
  An Executive Committee member has said that only three 
members at yesterday's meeting -- which was attended by Mahmud 
'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf), Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh, Samir Ghawshah, Jawid al-Ghusayn, Jamal al-Surani, 
Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, 'Ali Ishaq, and Yasir 'Amr -- 
announced their agreement to participate in the authority. The 
three are: 'Amr, al-Ghusayn, and al-Nashashibi. Four members 
announced their refusal openly. They are: Abu-Mazin, 
Abu-al-Lutf, Ghawshah, and al-Surani. As for 'Abd-Rabbuh, he 
asked for some time to consider the issue. 
  During the meeting President 'Arafat phoned Executive 
Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab, who is in Amman, and 
People's Party leader Bashir al-Barghuti, asking them to 
participate in the authority, but they refused. 'Ali Ishaq did 
not give a specific reply. Maybe because Muhammad 'Abbas 
(Abu-al-'Abbas), leader of the Palestine Liberation Front, 
represented by Ishaq, asked to come to Tunis and discuss the 
issue alone with President 'Arafat. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that during the meeting yesterday some 
Executive Committee members raised the need to agree first on 
rules for the authority so that its role will be clear, 
especially its link with the Executive Committee as an authority 
for the Palestinian authority. 
  Al-Nashashibi stressed during the debates the need to define 
responsibilities for the authority and to draw up rules similar 
to those whereby the Executive Committee operates. Other 
speakers criticized what they termed "haste" in the Palestinian 
police's entry into Gaza and Jericho. They demanded that the 
leadership method be changed before agreeing on the names. They 
expressed their fear of a repetition of the "autocratic method," 
which they said has for some years been adopted by the Executive 
Committee. 
  Some Executive Committee members objected to what they 
termed 
Fatah's monopoly on decisions and appointments to sensitive 
posts. They said that the appointments were made without 
consulting the Executive Committee and sometimes without 
consulting the Fatah Central Committee itself, merely on the 
grounds that President 'Arafat is the chairman of the 
Palestinian authority. 
  As for figures inside the occupied territories, AL-HAYAH has 
learned that a series of contacts have been held with Dr. Haydar 
'Abd-al-Shafi, Mahir al-Masri, and Faysal al-Husayni. They all 
refused to be included in forming the authority. President 
'Arafat invited al-Husayni to meet with him in Tunis on 
Wednesday. While contacts with Ilyas Frayj have produced no 
results so far, as he asked for time to consider the issue. 
  An Executive Committee member said that the tension 
accompanying the appointment of the Palestinian authority 
members is attributable to the fact that the matter no longer 
has anything to do with the issuing of statements and adoption 
of positions. "It is a real responsibility as regards the 
running of Palestinian affairs in the Jericho area and the Gaza 
Strip, from power, education, and health care to developing the 
course of the economic and financial cycle." 
  He pointed out that current meetings and consultations at 
the 
Executive Committee level coincide with the donors' observations 
about the method of making economic decisions and managing 
international aid, and also with the "confusion" which Executive 
Committee members have noted in the police forces' entry into 
Gaza and Jericho, and which has led to delaying the selection of 
the authority members.

<F P=106> [Sawsan Abu-Husayn report: "Nabil Sha'th Tells AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: Palestinian Foreign Affairs Will Not Be Under Israeli 
Control"] 
  [Text] Cairo -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, adviser to Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat, has confirmed that Yasir 'Arafat is 
ready to take over the national authority this week. He said 
that executive steps have already begun for the assumption of 
national authority and that Palestinian police units will begin 
to arrive in Gaza and Jericho. The vanguards of these forces, 
he said, have reached the Egyptian-Palestinian border. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Sha'th explained the 
"agreement, emphasizing that it is much better than the 
Declaration of Principles because there have been many 
amendments. If those opposed to the agreement knew these 
amendments well, they would change their minds because the 
agreement is very different from the Declaration of Principles. 
[quotation mark as published] 
  He stressed that the agreement was, for the first time, 
signed by the PLO and the state of Israel and that it was agreed 
to call the national authority the Palestinian Authority. That 
authority will implement all the international agreements 
concluded by the PLO. That authority, he said, will have the 
right to take charge of foreign affairs, which, in other words, 
will not be under Israeli control. The Palestinian Authority 
will have the right to have representative offices abroad in 
addition to the existing embassies of the state of Palestine 
throughout the world. 
  As an example of the Palestinian Authority handling its own 
foreign affairs, Sha'th cited the agreement he signed with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher on aid in the transfer of 
authority, to the tune of $5 million and 200 police vehicles. 
  He said the agreement consisted of three parts: The first is 
the agreement itself, the second consists of four appendices, 
and the third consists of exchanged letters. They complement 
one another "and we can say that this agreement is a first step 
that will lead to other steps related to Jerusalem, the 
repatriation of refugees, the area of Jericho, and the 
settlements." He added that "in the transitional period the PLO 
will work on the Jerusalem issue to ensure that our rights in it 
are not eroded." 
  He also said: The Palestinian-Israeli agreement is a prelude 
to comprehensive peace based on Security Council Resolutions 242 
and 338, and not as claimed by certain people who try to cast 
doubt. 
  He descsribed what has been published about formation of an 
authority council as mere speculation, noting that the PLO's 
Executive Committee was in continuous session for the purpose of 
setting up the authority. 
  On the powers of the Palestinian Authority, Sha'th said that 
Palestinian officials would have a right to stop and detain an 
Israeli suspect and then hand him over to the Israeli 
authorities, and also prohibit possession of arms by members of 
the public without a license. 
  On the date of 'Arafat's departure for Jericho, he said: 
That will be announced minutes before it takes place.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member </F>
Sulayman al-Najjab, in Amman, by Sa'id Mu'addi from the "With 
the Events" program; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, PLO Executive 
Committee member, currently in Amman: You boycotted the 
Executive Committee meetings. You also refuse to take part in 
the Palestinian authority. What is the reason? 
  [Al-Najjab] I did not attend the Executive Committee 
meetings, which were devoted to endorsing decisions that were 
made without consultation with the Executive Committee. I 
announced that I would not take part in the Palestinian 
authority under the agreement recently signed in Cairo. This 
authority would remain under the control of the Israeli military 
government, and it is rather similar to a civil administration. 
That is why I refused to participate in this authority. 
  [Mu'addi] What is the solution, and what should Yasir 
'Arafat do in this phase? Why does the minority not comply with 
the majority's decision? 
  [Al-Najjab] Many Executive Committee members are not 
attending the meetings being held in Tunis. I am fully 
convinced that this agreement will not succeed in achieving any 
of the Palestinian people's national objectives. This agreement 
will not improve the Palestinian people's living conditions. 
Our people will continue to adhere to their goal regarding 
national independence and solving the refugees' issue in 
accordance with UN resolutions. 
  [Mu'addi] You are the [Palestinian] People's Party's 
representative in the Executive Committee. What is the 
alternative to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement? 
  [Al-Najjab] As you know, I believe that we have long been 
demanding a peaceful settlement of both the Arab-Israeli 
conflict and the Palestinian-Israeli dispute based on 
implementing the pertinent UN resolutions, particularly the 
Security Council resolutions. This agreement is not a phased or 
final solution. The solution, or the alternative, is to hold 
more serious negotiations, which should be based on the 
resolutions of international legitimacy and which should seek 
their implementation, rather than to avoid the implementation 
of, or commitment to, these resolutions. 
  What is required is to secure Israeli withdrawal as 
stipulated by the Security Council resolutions. The 
Gaza-Jericho arrangements, or agreement, have nothing to do with 
implementing the UN resolutions. This agreement, rather, seeks 
to entrench the current situation. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab: There are Palestinian 
figures from the West Bank and Gaza Strip who refuse to join the 
future Palestinian authority. What is your comment? 
  [Al-Najjab] What you indicate proves that this agreement has 
not convinced anyone that it will secure even a temporary 
solution. The alternative is to search for a solution that will 
secure the Palestinian people's rights. Such a solution can be 
achieved if the Israeli side commits itself to Resolution 242 
and to the fact that any phased settlements are only 
preparations and steps on the path of implementing Resolution 
242. 
  [Mu'addi] But there is an agreement signed by the two sides 
regarding the transitional phase. 
  [Al-Najjab] If the Palestinian people, or their majority, do 
not accept this agreement, then it cannot be implemented. There 
are many examples in this regard. The fate of any solution that 
does not secure both the Palestinian people's rights and the 
actual interests of both sides would... [sentence incomplete as 
heard] 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, Executive Committee 
member, currently in Amman: Thank you very much. 
  [Al-Najjab] You are very welcome, Sa'id.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hamas Vows To Continue Its </F>
Operations, Warns Against `One-Party System'"] 
  [Excerpt] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Islamic Resistance 
Movement (Hamas) yesterday vowed to continue its operations 
against the Israeli occupation despite the agreement signed by 
the PLO and Israel in Cairo to implement self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho. It described the agreement as "capitulationist, null 
and void, and not binding on the Palestinian people." 
  In a statement, of which AL-HAYAH has received a copy, Hamas 
urged the Palestinian authority and its police to serve the 
people. It warned of "the consequences of factionalism, a 
one-party system, submitting to the Zionist enemy, and 
preventing our people's mujahidin from carrying out resistance 
operations against the occupation army and settlers." 
  Hamas welcomed "dialogue and meeting with all Palestinian 
national forces and influential figures on the basis of 
continuing the resistance, defeating the occupation, and sparing 
our people the calamities of sedition and infighting." It 
condemned "the use of arms to resolve political and family 
disputes." 
  Hamas vowed to continue mass struggle "against the 
occupation 
and its symbols." [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Arab] Member of the Knesset [MK] Talab al-Sani' has 
met with Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, a founding member of Hamas, the 
Islamic Resistance Movement, at ('Ashmoret) Prison today. Talab 
al-Sani' had this to say about the session: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Sani'] The meeting follows recent 
political developments. This is not the first time I have 
called on Shaykh Yasin at the prison. I met with Foreign 
Minister Shim'on to press for Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's release 
against the background of recent political developments and 
Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's deteriorating health. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Political developments in the peace 
process and the Israeli-Palestinian agreement must have come up 
during your talk with him. Where does he and the Islamic 
movement in general stand on these issues? 
  [Al-Sani'] Shaykh Ahmad Yasin expressly stated that Hamas 
will not use violence to topple the agreements; it will use the 
same civilized methods used on the Israeli street. He said the 
opposition has the right to express itself. Hamas, said Shaykh 
Yasin, will respect the Palestinian police force in that it is 
of the Palestinian people. As for the prospects for Shaykh 
Yasin's release, he said it is every human being's wish is to be 
free and that freedom is a natural right for every human being. 
However, he is in detention because he believes in the 
Palestinian people's right to freedom. He also argues that 
people under occupation are entitled to resist occupation. 
Shaykh Yasin said he supports the principle of a just peace 
that guarantees the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. 
He is opposed to occupation and the shedding of innocent blood 
on both sides. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Linda Sherzer video report; italicized passages in English] </F>
  [Excerpts] Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, the Palestinian Islamic 
Jihad leader, maintains that navigator Ron Arad is the only IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] soldier missing in Lebanon who is still 
alive. Al-Shaqaqi made this observation in an interview with 
Linda Sherzer in Damascus last week. He contends that he does 
not know where Ron Arad is being held today. Here is Linda 
Sherzer's report from Syria: 
  [Begin recording] [Sherzer] Before Fathi al-Shaqaqi was 
expelled from the Gaza Strip, he was considered one of the most 
dangerous people there. In his office in Damascus, he proudly 
explains the reason: 
  [Al-Shaqaqi] From October '86 to October '87, we 
killed from the Israeli soldiers more than all the other 
factions inside Palestine. 
  [Sherzer] [passage omitted] You have travelled 
through the Arab world. Do you know anything about the fate of 
the missing Israeli servicemen? 
  [Al-Shaqaqi] You know, I think all the Israeli 
soldiers, except Ron Arad, are dead. 
  [Sherzer] Do you know that for a fact? 
  [Al-Shaqaqi] Yes, for a fact. 
  [Sherzer] Nowadays he and his wife and two children live in 
Damascus. He teaches his four-year-old daughter about the 
Palestinian cause. In his opinion, the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
is a disaster. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The U.S. assistant secretary of state for Middle 
East affairs made a statement in Amman yesterday in which he 
disclosed the U.S. Administration's determination to interfere 
in the events witnessed in Yemen. He described what is taking 
place there as civil war, and talked about what he called 
military victories and the determination to fight in these 
events. 
  This fact that this statement was made by someone who is 
also 
an official in the CIA reveals once again the dubious U.S. 
intentions toward this fraternal country. 
  In a comment on this, JANA's political editor asked whether 
these Americans have come to mediate, as their media claim, or 
whether they have come, as is their custom, to sow discord, 
incite hatred, and make the fighting spread, within the 
framework of the plan they are implementing to destroy the Arab 
nation.

to the conflict in Yemen to safeguard the public interest and 
settle their differences within the framework of a constructive 
dialogue based on God's shari'ah and to place Yemeni unity above 
any other consideration. In a statement released by the Muslim 
Brotherhood, it called on the Arab and Muslim rulers and all 
Arab and Muslim organizations to play the required role to close 
the Yemeni ranks and stop the bloodshed. 
  The Muslim Brotherhood expressed its worry about the 
deterioration of the situation in Yemen and the threat to Yemeni 
unity. It noted that the fraternal Yemeni people's property and 
resources are threatened. It stressed the need to pool efforts 
and resources to heal the rift in Yemen and bring the parties 
together in the interest of that country and its unity and its 
people's security, freedom, lives, and generation's resources.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 May (MENA)--The Arab Republic of Egypt has 
announced the resumption of diplomatic relations with South 
Africa at ambassadorial level as of Tuesday 10 May 1994. 
  A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry today said 
Egypt's 
decision to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa 
conforms to Egypt's position, which supported all stages of the 
democratic movement and the annihilation of apartheid in South 
Africa. These movements began in 1989 and culminated with the 
democratic nonracial elections in April 1994. In the election, 
every citizen was able to exercise his right to chose his 
representative within the context of freedom, equality, and 
justice, thus ending the system of apartheid.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 May (MENA)--Two citizens were injured today 
while passing by a gas station in Sadafa town in Asyut 
Governorate when shots were fired indiscriminately. 
  An Interior Ministry security source stated that citizen 
Muhammad Hasan Darwish informed the Sadafa police station that 
while he was inside the gas station that he owns he noticed some 
strangers wearing municipal clothing. He became suspicious of 
their movements and when he attempted to identify them, one of 
them fired shots in the air from a gun he took out from under 
his clothing. They exchanged gunfire and a regular sentry 
present at the scene of the incident also participated in the 
shooting. 
  The perpetrators of the crime escaped. They drove away in 
one of the cars parked in the taxi parking lot near the gas 
station. 
  The security source said that the two injured citizens are 
Fu'ad Zaki Abu-Yusuf, headmaster of Majris Preparatory School in 
Sadafa. He received superficial injuries in the nose. The 
second citizen is Ernest Anwar Askerios, an employee of the 
Social Security Department in the same town. He was shot in the 
neck and was taken to Sadafa General Hospital for treatment. 
  Commanders of the Asyut Security Department, men from the 
various investigation departments, and forensics experts moved 
to the scene of the crime to search for evidence. The police 
are concentrating their efforts on finding the criminals. The 
prosecution has been informed to proceed with the investigations. 
  Earlier the town of Sadafa was the scene of another 
terrorist 
incident where unknown gunmen fired at the checkpoint of the 
Sadafa police station.

  [Text] Cairo, May 9 (AFP)--Egyptian security forces 
tortured to death a Moslem fundamentalist lawyer who defended 
the spiritual leader of the outlawed al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah 
militants, Cairo lawyers said Monday [9 May]. 
  The death of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani a week after he was 
arrested was "a premeditated murder, and the torture he suffered 
was an odious crime," a statement from the Order of Cairo 
Lawyers said. 
  Madani was a leading member of the defence committee set up 
for al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) spiritual guide 
Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, who was sentenced to seven years in 
jail by the state security court last week. 
The al-Jama'ah has been waging a bloody two-year campaign to 
topple the secular government of President Husni Mubarak, in 
which more than 380 people have died. 
  An interior ministry official said he was "in no position to 
comment" on the lawyer's death. 
  The statement said Madani was arrested on April 26 and taken 
to a secret destination. "Not even his family knew where he 
was. They only heard about his death on Friday." The lawyers 
said they were "horrified" by Madani's death, describing it as 
"an act of aggression against all lawyers." 
  Security forces arrested Madani during a four-hour search of 
his office, in the presence of four colleagues. 
  The 40-year-old lawyer from Qina in northern Egypt was 
married with two daughters. 
  President of the Order of Egyptian Lawyers Ahmad al-Khawajah 
asked state prosecutor Raja' al-'Arabi to conduct a new autopsy 
on Madani's body Sunday in the presence of a doctor chosen by 
the order. The Egyptian Human Rights Organisation made a 
similar request two days after Madani's arrest, when it heard 
that the lawyer had been transferred to special wards in Qasr 
al-'Ayni hospital in Cairo reserved for prisoners, where 
according to unconfirmed reports Madani was killed. 
  The organisation also condemned the jailing of a journalist 
working for a pro-fundamentalist newspaper, AL-SHA'B, by a 
military court. The journalist, Abu-Husayn, was sentenced to a 
year in prison for "revealing military secrets," although the 
information -- about military manoeuvres and arms purchases -- 
was officially announced two weeks later, the organisation said. 
  Mubarak two years ago ordered that suspected Moslem 
militants 
appear before military courts to expedite their trials. But the 
human rights organisation said that Husayn's case showed that 
journalists and other opinion makers could also be tried before 
these courts.

  [Excerpt] Washington, 10 May (MENA)--Field Marshal Muhammad 
Husayn Tantawi, minister of defense and war production, has 
stated that his talks with U.S. officials during his current 
visit to Washington will deal with important issues, primarily 
the development of military cooperation between the United 
States and Egypt, the Egyptian Armed Forces' needs, and the 
modernization of armaments, in addition to issues pertaining to 
regional security and Egypt's role in achieving the region's 
security. 
  Speaking at a meeting with Egyptian correspondents in 
Washington, Field Marshal Tantawi said: In view of the changes 
dictated by the new world order, there is a constant need to 
develop and strengthen the Egyptian Armed Forces in the 
armaments and training fields. He added: Our Armed Forces 
should maintain a particular standard of strength and efficiency 
to play their role in establishing regional security in 
participation with the international community. He stressed 
that achieving this will be an investment in human resources, 
which will benefit society in every field. 
  The defense minister noted that the Armed Forces are 
constantly working to introduce advanced technology and modern 
training and armament systems and that this will be among the 
issues he will discuss in his meetings with U.S. officials. 
  Field Marshal Muhammad Husayn Tantawi said: The Egyptian 
Armed Forces belong to the Egyptian people alone. According to 
this concept, the Armed Forces serve the Egyptian people and 
their development is an extremely important investment. The 
stronger these Armed Forces are the more capable they will be of 
protecting society and the homeland from any aggression. 
  The defense minister stressed that strengthening the Armed 
Forces will make them a deterrent force that others would have 
to consider, because any aggressor will have to think deeply 
before committing any aggression if he realizes that these 
forces can repel him. 
  Field Marshal Tantawi went on to say that U.S.-Egyptian 
cooperation in the military production sphere, both with regard 
to the advanced M1A tanks and other weapons, is proceeding well 
and that there are numerous opportunities for developing and 
expanding the scope of this cooperation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Washington, 10 May (MENA)--Field Marshal Muhammad 
Husayn Tantawi, minister of defense and war production, has 
stated that the Egyptian Armed Forces are working to achieve the 
right "balance" between their size and the level of their 
armament. 
  He said that achieving a reasonable and correct size relying 
on modern and advanced armament is better than keeping 
"outdated" weapons that require expensive maintenance and many 
troops, which is a burden and does not achieve the required 
benefit. 
  He said this is why the Egyptian Armed Forces are constantly 
working to develop and modernize their weapons. 
  In a statement, Field Marshal Tantawi said there is constant 
action within the framework of military cooperation between 
Egypt and the United States to agree on the new weapons that the 
Egyptian forces need. He noted that this will be one of the 
main issues that he will discuss with U.S. officials during his 
current visit to the United States. He also said that current 
cooperation between Egypt and the United States covers three 
main fields: training, armament, and maintenance. 
  The defense minister stressed that Egypt has its own concept 
of its Armed Forces' size and armament. He said that this 
"precise formula" needs careful study because an increase in the 
size of the Armed Forces will make them "overmanned." He added 
that the difficult point in the formula lies in a reduction in 
size requiring to be offset by advanced armaments that will 
replace the outdated weapons. 
  Field Marshal Tantawi regretted the fighting in Yemen. 
Answering a question, he said that no party can achieve real 
gains or emerge victorious from this fighting. The Yemeni 
people will be the loser.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Ghallab and Jihad 'Abd-al-Mun'im at the </F>
People's Assembly] 
  [Excerpts] The People's Assembly members yesterday warned 
against the increasing U.S. grants that help the government levy 
more taxes on Egyptians. They demanded that these grants be 
dedicated to productive services like water and electricity. 
  The members objected to the interference of the American 
Agency for International Development in the work of artisan 
associations through the extension of direct loans. They 
described AID requests for detailed information about the 
artisan associations involved as an attempt to obtain Egyptian 
secrets and thus establish U.S. control of craftsmen. 
  The Assembly members pointed out that the agreement to grant 
small business loans entitles AID to deal directly with any 
association demanding a loan provided that association agrees to 
submit its activity to inspection by AID auditors without 
interference by the Egyptian Government. The members said that 
the Government has thus waived its rights and created a state 
within a state. 
  People's Assembly Speaker Dr. Fathi Surur was asked why the 
Egyptian Government has relinquished its powers and left the 
associations on their own with AID. Once a grant is given by 
anyone, it becomes Egyptian. The Government has agreed to let 
associations benefit from AID grants, he said. 
  State Minister for International Cooperation Dr. Yusuf 
Butrus-Ghali said that the associations have requested to deal 
directly with AID and they have rejected the government's 
intervention on the excuse that it delays loans. [passage 
omitted] 
  Some members expressed their fears that the U.S. side might 
specify the associations that will receive loans. Dr. Surur 
asked the state minister if the United States is entitled to 
determine which association gets a loan. Dr. Butrus-Ghali 
replied: The Egyptian Government specifies the associations 
that can get loans, provided that they have a certified board of 
directors. He added that 23,000 have obtained loans, averaging 
2,200 Egyptian pounds. The rate of repayment is 98.5 percent, he 
said. 
  MP Salah Tawfiq remarked that the grant in its entirety will 
not even solve the problems of 4,000 craftsmen in Egypt, where 
there are millions of craftsmen. He rejected U.S. patronage of 
craftsmen, noting that the grant might harm Egypt through loans 
that result in U.S. control of craftsmen. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak's 
speech was presented to the Fifth Arab Energy Conference which 
opened in Cairo today. In his speech, Mubarak proposed a plan 
to act as a nucleus for collective Arab action in petroleum 
spheres in light of the huge oil and natural gas resources 
available to the Arab countries, with their impact on the world 
energy situation. 
  President Mubarak's plan, which was read on his behalf by 
Oil 
Minister Dr. Hamdi al-Banbi, calls for finding a mechanism to 
achieve cooperation in designing and implementing petroleum, 
natural gas, and petrochemicals projects in the Arab countries. 
The plan also calls for devising ways to coordinate among Arab 
countries so that they will collectively have the ability to 
design, implement, and administer petroleum projects and 
manufacture the equipment necessary for these projects. 
  President Mubarak outlined the benefits the Arab countries 
would derive from this mechanism in implementing oil and natural 
gas projects. These benefits include lower costs, exchange of 
expertise, technology transfer, integration among Arab 
countries, and boosting capital industries with a view to 
creating more jobs and breaking the world monopoly on the 
implementation of oil projects. 
  As part of the executive measures for the project, the 
president proposed the formation of a cooperation agency for 
petroleum projects comprising a national center for cooperation 
in oil projects in each of the member states and a primary 
coordination center in one of the Arab countries. This is in 
addition to forming a data bank to provide information on 
potential projects, the timing of their implementation, and the 
equipment and capabilities of the contractors. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, May 9 (AFP) -- Troops loyal to Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih broke through the last defenses 
north of Aden on Monday [9 May] and were just five kilometres 
(three miles) from the southern stronghold, the north said. 
  But an AFP correspondent in central Aden said the port city 
was calm with no sound of battle on the outskirts. Aden Radio 
played military music and rallied for reservists to join the 
battle. 
  A northern military spokesman in the capital, meanwhile, 
said 
Salih's troops were "waging decisive battles against the last 
remnants of secessionist forces." 
  The battle for Aden had reached Dar Sa'd, just five 
kilometres from the city, he said. Salih's troops also captured 
the south's main air base, Al-Anad, 50 kilometres (30 miles) 
north of Aden. 
  The southern forces of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a 
bitter rival of Salih, have a second air base in the Hadramaut, 
700 kilometres (420 miles) east of Aden. 
  Two Scud missiles, meanwhile, crashed into the Yemeni 
capital, without causing any casualties. Witnesses said the 
missiles fell in empty lots in the suburbs, causing little 
damage. 
  The south has been counting on its warplanes and Scud 
missiles to hold off the north since civil war broke out on 
Thursday, after several months of political feuding between 
Salih and al-Bid. 
  To the north of Aden, a battle with tanks and artillery was 
raging for control of Dhaleh, a town 60 kilometres (35 miles) 
from the port city, the spokesman in Sanaa said. 
  Anti-aircraft guns had shot down a southern fighter over 
Abyan Province east of Aden and clashes were also taking place 
in Lahij Province north of the city. 
  Earlier the southern-controlled Defence Ministry said 
"thousands of citizens" had responded to a general mobilisation 
order to defend Aden, a city of more than 500,000 people, under 
attack from the north and east. 
  Aden Radio, preparing for a possible siege, said southern 
forces were putting up fierce resistance and had destroyed two 
of the north's bases outside the city. 
  The north, which had already said Sunday that Aden was about 
to fall, said its forces were Monday "ready at any moment to 
surround and break through the separatist strongholds... at the 
gates of Aden." 
  Seventy-four northern fighters have been killed and 240 
wounded in a series of northern advances, military officials 
here said, giving the first toll issued by either side. 
  They said southern forces suffered "enormous losses." 
  Civil war erupted Thursday between forces loyal to Salih, a 
conservative northerner, and those of al-Bid, leader of the 
Yemen Socialist Party.

<F P=106> [Statement by "a responsible military source" at the </F>
Ministry of Defense and the General Command Staff; date not 
given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Our valiant Armed Forces, the forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy, today continued their successive 
victories and great advance toward accomplishing their missions 
on all axes and directions where the battles are raging against 
the forces of apostasy and secession rebelling against the 
constitutional legitimacy in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  With success from God and with broad popular support in the 
governorates of Aden, Lahij, and Abyan and other governorates of 
the Republic, and also with the resolve of the sincere men of 
our valiant Armed Forces' heroes, great victories were achieved 
today. The forces of the al-'Amaliqah Brigade, the 2d Armored 
Brigade, and the 8th Special Forces Brigade managed to 
accomplish their combat missions successfully. 
  Today, the al-'Amaliqah forces destroyed the Madram Brigade 
and seized all its equipment. The Brigade's chiefs of staff 
surrendered, and its commander fled. A large number of officers 
and soldiers from the Madram Brigade and the 5th Armored Brigade 
joined the forces of the constitutional legitimacy. These 
brigades are still waging decisive heroic battles against the 
remnants of the secessionist forces of apostasy. 
  Also today, the forces of the 56th Brigade managed with 
great 
success to storm the defensive fortifications of the forces of 
apostasy and secession. The vanguards of these forces arrived 
in the area of Dar Sa'd, close to the Shaykh 'Uthman 
neighborhood, one of the outskirts of the governorate of Aden. 
They also closed the way to the supplies heading for the camps 
of the misled ones who are dominated by the forces of apostasy 
and secession in the governorate of Lahij. 
  Our valiant forces are now continuing to wage a heroic 
battle 
against the forces of the Salah-al-Din camp, which are being 
misled by the rebellious secessionist gang, in order to force 
them into surrendering and yielding to both the people's will 
and legitimacy. This force is currently in the throes of death 
before the courageous heroic blows dealt by the heroes of our 
Armed Forces who continue to chase the remaining dens of the 
elements of the rebellious secessionist gang. 
  On the southern axis, our courageous Armed Forces, the 
forces 
of the constitutional legitimacy, managed to storm and capture 
the third fortified defense line of the forces of the al-Buzah 
Brigade, and continued their advance to other fortifications. 
Today, Monday, 250 personnel of the al-Buzah Brigade 
surrendered with their full weapons and equipment, and declared 
that they joined the forces of unity and constitutional 
legitimacy. 
  Large quantities of weapons, equipment, and vehicles were 
seized, including eight tanks and a number of guns and armored 
vehicles. Our forces are currently chasing the fleeing remnants 
of the secessionist forces of apostasy in that area. 
  Also in the governorate of Lahij, the heroes of the 2d 
Armored Brigade continued to advance steadily and accomplish 
their combat missions successfully in terms of combing the 
district of al-Dali' for the remnants of the forces of apostasy 
and rebellion. Large numbers from the 'Abbud Brigade in the 
district of al-Dali' joined the forces of unity and legitimacy. 
  During the combing campaigns being carried out along the 
collapsing positions of the forces of apostasy and secession, 
our forces found huge quantities of Marxist and Leninist books, 
through which the YSP was trying to obliterate the national 
identity and to distort the thought of the sons of our Yemeni 
people, and to psychologically and ideologically indoctrinate 
the fighters of the military units that used to be under its 
control. 
  The heroic al-Wahdah infantry, artillery, and armored 
brigades, today continued to wage battles of bravery and honor 
in defense of unity and legitimacy. 
  In another development, our valiant Armed Forces' Air Force 
today, continued its successful air attacks, during which it has 
successfully bombarded the set targets. Our aircraft returned 
safely to base. 
  The antiaircraft defenses today downed an aircraft belonging 
to the secessionist gang near the city of Mudiyah in the Abyan 
Governorate. 
  The source hailed the splendid and heroic performance of the 
personnel of our valiant Armed Forces and their great triumph 
for the will of the people and their option for unity, 
democracy, and the defense of their constitutional institutions. 
  The source also lauded the high national morale, enthusiasm, 
and commitment to the national responsibility expressed by the 
masses of our Yemeni people against the secessionist gang, and 
their support for their sons in the valiant Armed Forces. 
  It congratulated our people on the great victories over the 
secessionist gang, stressing that the victories that have been 
achieved over the gang of fragmentation, apostasy, and 
secession, are attributed to God's grace, and are the fruit of 
the steadfastness of the masses of our Yemeni people, their 
support for the forces of Yemeni unity and constitutional 
legitimacy, and their confrontation of the plans to dismember 
and destroy the homeland. 
  The source said that the losses among the ranks of our 
valiant Armed Forces as a result of the fighting that has been 
raging against the forces of apostasy and secession since these 
forces ignited the fire of war last Wednesday and until now have 
reached 74 martyrs, and 314 wounded, in addition to 17 civilian 
martyrs as a result of the treacherous aggression of the forces 
of apostasy and secession. There was no immediate count 
available of the number of the martyrs and the wounded personnel 
of the Central Security, who were betrayed by the forces of 
apostasy and secession in Aden, who attacked their camp on the 
sad and bloody day of Wednesday. 
  Up until the time this statement was being prepared, our 
valiant Armed Forces, have managed, on all axes of the fighting, 
to inflict heavy defeats on the forces of apostasy and 
secession, and to seize huge quantities of weapons, equipment, 
and serviceable vehicles. Large numbers of the troops who were 
misled by the rebelling secessionist gang have also joined the 
forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, renewing their 
allegiance to the legitimacy, the constitutional institutions, 
and to the one Yemeni homeland, the homeland of freedom, 
justice, democracy, progress, and prosperity. 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If you 
will aid the cause of God, He will aid you, and plant your feet 
firmly. [Koranic verse]

<F P=106> [Report by Amjad Mu'alla] </F>
  [Text] A senior Yemeni official has accused foreign 
quarters of interfering in Yemeni affairs in an attempt to 
strike at Yemeni unity and kindle the fires of sedition by 
supplying the warring factions with weapons and encouraging 
fighting. He appealed to the political forces in Aden and the 
Governorate of Lahij, stronghold of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP], to move in order to decisively settle matters in favor of 
the Armed Forces. He stressed that the current fighting is an 
internal affair and there is no room for foreign mediation. 
  Reached by telephone in Sanaa, Mazhar al-Taqiy, 
undersecretary of the Yemeni Information Ministry, told 
AL-DUSTUR that large quantities of weapons were seized at sea 
and airports. He added that the Yemeni authorities confiscated 
military communications equipment, bugging devices, and certain 
missile batteries aboard a Boeing 707 about one month ago. 
Everything was purchased from a British company and the plane 
belonged to an Ugandan airline company. He said large 
quantities of light weapons were found and confiscated from the 
Yemeni Socialist Party headquarters in Sanaa in the last few 
days. 
  Al-Taqiy questioned the YSP motives behind the possession of 
these quantities of weapons and said no state can allow a local 
party to import weapons for itself or form its own army and 
militias. He said that importing weapons in such quantities 
clearly indicates that foreign quarters do not want to see unity 
or democracy in Yemen as these act like an earthquake to foreign 
forces. 
  Regarding the latest developments in Yemen, al-Taqiy said 
the 
Armed Forces are on their way to end what he termed a rebellion 
led by an adventurous group in the YSP leadership. He added 
that the Armed Forces, which represent the constitutional 
legitimacy and belong to the various governorates in the 
Republic, are 15 km from the city of Aden and will enter and 
take control of it. 
  Mazhar al-Taqiy added that yesterday a large number of the 
forces that had been stationed in the southeastern Sunaywah 
[name as transliterated]. Governorate joined the Yemeni Army, 
bringing their equipment and weapons. 
  Al-Taqiy said Yemen still rejects mediation to stop the 
fighting, citing the statements of Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih to the House of Representatives on 7 May, 
deeming the situation in Yemen an internal affair. 
  The Yemeni Information Ministry under secretary cited 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's assertion that unity will not 
be abandoned, whatever the cost, and that the rebellious 
leadership in the YSP should surrender to the legitimate 
authority. 
  He said: We expect the unionists in the YSP and other Aden 
residents to take control of the situation, arrest the rebels 
and hand them over to the legitimate authority. 
  Answering a question as to whether there have been attempts 
by some Arab parties to mediate, al-Taqiy said: "Mediation 
between whom? What is happening now is that a group that has 
defied constitutional legitimacy has ignited a war in several 
regions in Yemen. We ask any side that wants to mediate if it 
would accept mediation if one of its parties were to ignite an 
internal war." 
  He added: We think that this is purely an internal affair 
and that the rebels should respect constitutional legitimacy and 
the state institutions established in accordance with the 
elections on 27 April 1993. They should submit to legitimacy, 
and then everything will return to the way it was before. 
  While observing the developments in fraternal Yemen, 
AL-DUSTUR has also tried to contact Yemeni officials in Aden. 
However, they could not be reached because telephone links with 
Aden have been cut.

  [Text] Sanaa, May 10 (AFP)--Southern Yemeni air force jets 
attacked rival army positions north of Aden on Tuesday [10 May], 
witnesses in the area said. 
  The witnesses, contacted by telephone did not give details 
of 
casualties or damage in the raids in the Ta'izz region, some 150 
kilometres (93 miles) northwest of the key southern stronghold 
of Aden. 
  Southern officials said their troops had pushed back an 
offensive on the port city, formerly the capital of South Yemen. 
  On Monday a northern military spokesman in Sanaa said 
southern units were in retreat toward Aden, and troops loyal to 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih had reached Darb al-'Amr, just 
five kilometres (three miles) from the city, having broken 
through the last southern defences. 
  But Aden residents said the city was calm with no sign of 
battle on the outskirts. 
  A resident of Sanaa meanwhile said families were leaving the 
capital in large numbers, bound for villages or the mountains. 
  Southern forces fired two Scud missiles at Sanaa Monday.

  [Text] Our forces, defending unity, democracy, and 
modernization, have continued their heroic resistance and 
constitutional steadfastness against the forces of the 
adventurist gang of the al-Ahmar clan, who are continuing their 
artillery and rocket barrage and engaging in successive attacks 
on the former eastern border areas, these being Ga'tabah, 
al-Dali, al-Rahidah, Karish, al-Bayda and Mukayras. The forces 
of the bloody military gang of al-Ahmar have continued to direct 
artillery, rocket, and aircraft fire on al-Dali and the villages 
around it, and to confront our forces, who are supported by the 
citizenry. 
  For the ninth time, units from the Republican Guards, the 
central security forces, the 8th Independent Armored Brigade, 
and the al-Hamzah Brigade have attacked, in an attempt to break 
through the our forces' defensive positions -- they were 
repulsed and sent back to where they came from. Members of 
these units surrendered and joined our forces, having realized 
the falsity of the slogans concerning the defense of 
constitutionality and unity being prattled by the influential 
al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa. 
  In Qa'tabah and Karish, our heroic defending forces repulsed 
the forces of the gang of the al-Ahmar clan, which had continued 
its efforts to break through our forces' defensive positions, 
directing intensive artillery and rocket fire against the 
villages and houses of innocent civilians. This was an attempt 
to erode the high morale characterizing the heroic defenders and 
the masses of the people of Karish, known for their outstanding 
role in the struggle during all stages of the revolution, and in 
the defense of unity. 
  In the capital of Abyan Governorate, units from the Amaliqah 
forces have suffered repeated defeats and have surrendered, with 
many of their men joining the ranks of our forces. Our forces, 
after reinforcing the encirclement of their positions, succeeded 
in storming their positions, even after they sought shelter in 
the houses, schools, and fields of citizens. At noon today the 
commanding officer of the 54th Battalion of the Amaliqah forces, 
Colonel Ahmad Salim al-Nahmi, surrendered, together with what 
was left of the officers and men of his battalion. They joined 
the ranks of our forces which, supported by the sons of 
Zinjibar, Ji'ar, and the surrounding villages, are continuing 
their operations to take full control of the situation in this 
governorate.

  [Excerpts] The South Yemen leaders announced today that the 
southern forces totally crushed the northern al-'Amaliqah 
Brigade during its advance toward Aden. 
  Aden radio announced in a statement broadcast today that the 
members of the al-'Amaliqah brigade are fleeing like frightened 
cats, as the radio put it, and that the southern forces are 
gradually taking control of the situation. 
  [Aden correspondent Ayhab 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali] Fighting has 
continued until the time of compiling this report, while the 
rest of the al-'Amaliqah forces, which are the forces stationed 
at the Abyan-Minzu-1990-Unity [as heard] area 40 miles to the 
east of Aden [sentence as heard]. These forces were joined 
yesterday by the remaining part of the (Kibsi) brigade, the 
second armored corps belonging to Sanaa. These forces fled the 
al-Rahah region in neighboring Lahad province following their 
defeat. All sorts of weapons are being used in this fierce 
battle. The troops of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid are 
pursuing these forces, which are fleeing toward the west. 
  In Lahad province in the north of Aden, President Salih's 
forces made an attempt to invade Kirsh village which is on the 
former border between the north and the south. Aden troops 
resisted these forces and made considerable progress. 
  Observers here agree on the superiority of the southern 
forces in Abyan and Lahad. Aircraft are playing a big role in 
this battle. Observers note that the forces retreating from 
Abyan and Lahad are doing so slowly, in the hope that help will 
reach them from Sanaa. The al-'Amaliqah battalion retreating 
from Abyan is in a tragic situation. It has fallen into a trap 
between the forces coming from Aden and those belonging the 30th 
brigade which came from Hadramawt. [passage omitted] 
  It is noted here that many of those who have surrendered 
from 
the northern army are soldiers, [word indistinct], and officers 
from the governorates of 'Ib, Ta'iz, al-Bayda', and other areas. 
They preferred to surrender because of the hardship they 
suffered at the hands of their commanders; as Lieutenant Mustafa 
Haris said, they were being treated like third-class citizens. 
Eyewitnesses coming from Lahad governorate said that forces of 
Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid were able to repell an attack 
launched against al-Dhala', which is 96 miles north of Aden. 
This took place after forces from Lahad, north of Aden, joined 
the troops of the 'Abud brigade stationed in al-Dhala. These 
forces have since yesterday midday moved to offensive positions. 
With the fierce fighting and battles, Sanaa's forces have lost 
control and carried out random shelling of al-Dhala, the capital 
of al-Mudiriyyah. This shelling involving the use of missiles 
resulted in damage to many of the villages near al- Dhala, such 
as Hajaf, al-Shu'ayb, Jabal Harir, Khuwayr, and others. 
  For the second consecutive day, life in Aden is normal. An 
under secretary at the Ministry of Public Service and 
Administrative Reform has inspected work at some institutions 
which are directly linked to the life of the citizens. The only 
thing that upset the normal course of life was an attempt by a 
military plane at 2015 to enter Aden airspace; the plane, 
however, had to flee as a result of intense gunfire and was not 
able to drop its load on vital installations in Aden. 
  Well-informed political sources in Aden have disclosed that 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is experiencing internal problems in Sanaa 
following the losses incurred by his military forces and their 
collapse after the blows they received from the Armed Forces in 
Aden.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has 
denied reports put out by the media of the bloody al-Ahmar clan, 
reports which have been repeated by the news agencies and 
radios, to the effect that the forces of the al-Ahmar gang have 
reached the Dar-Sa'd area in Aden governorate. 
  In a statement for the Yemeni news agency, SABA, the source 
said these reports were totally untrue. Dar-Sa'd town is 
tranquil and under the total control of the forces of national 
alignment, unity and democracy. 
  Moreover, the battles are taking place in the areas of 
al-Dali, Karish, and Mukayras, which are hundreds of kilometers 
from Aden. The source stated that the forces of unity and 
democracy are winning victories on all battle fronts, seizing 
advanced positions and routing the forces of the oppressive 
al-Ahmar gang. 
  The source said putting out such reports reveals the state 
of 
confusion and hysteria afflicting the forces of the gang of the 
al-Ahmar clan, who in their sick dreams are hiding the truth to 
obfuscate the successive defeats they are suffering by turning 
them into imaginary victories.

  [Text] The security director in Lahij Governorate has 
stressed that security and stability have been restored in that 
governate's districts, and that daily activities are proceeding 
normally in all workplaces and businesses. Colonel Husayn 
Qahtan, the governorate's security director, said in a statement 
for the Yemeni news agency, SABA', that workers in all public, 
private, and mixed enterprises were proceeding normally with 
their jobs in their various sectors. He said the supply 
situation in all districts was stable, and that the citizens 
were able to move about smoothly and safely. 
  He denied all the distorted reports being put out by the 
secessionist al-Ahmar clan concerning the situation in Lahij 
Governorate, in a desperate attempt to mislead local and foreign 
public opinion and to obfuscate the defeats it has suffered at 
the hands of the forces of unity and national alignment -- and 
at the hands of the heroic sons of the governorate. He 
discussed the stupid acts being perpetrated by the remnants of 
gangs from the secessionist al-Ahmar clan, who are shelling the 
villages in the governorate's districts, causing heavy losses in 
life and property to the peaceful inhabitants. He praised the 
sincere humanitarian efforts being made by doctors and health 
workers at the Ibn Khaldun Hospital in treating wounded 
children, women, and old men who had been directly targeted by 
the vanquished gangs of the bloody al-Ahmar family.

director general of the port of Aden, has stated that operations 
at the port have been uninterrupted and are proceeding normally. 
In a statement to the Yemeni news agency, SABA', he referred to

the port had been closed. He said that the port's operations 
had been proceeding normally without interruption, noting that 
the port was open to international navigation and was providing 
full services to all ships reaching it from other ports. 
Brother Muhammad Bin-Muhammad Shakir went on to say that a 
number of ships carrying various types of cargo were outside the 
port, and were awaiting their turn to enter the port when other

  [Text] Informed political sources in Aden have discovered 
evidence showing the participation of Arab states in the 
fighting currently taking place in Yemen, which was sparked off 
by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the gang of the al-Ahmar clan. The 
Yemeni news agency, SABA', was informed by those sources that 
there are soldiers involved in the fighting within the ranks of 
units of the al-Ahmar mercenary gang, in coordination with the 
governments of the countries they belong to. The sources said 
that among these countries is Sudan, which is ruled by General 
'Umar al-Bashir. Accordingly, Sudanese airports have been made 
available as assembly points for the military aircraft of 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and the gang of the al-Ahmar clan to take off 
from and carry out military operations against al-Hudaydah 
Airport. 
  These sources connected the position taken by 'Ali Abdallah 
Salih before the [word indistinct] parliament toward the call by 
the Arab League for the fighting in Yemen to stop, a stance that 
was the same as Sudan's, which considered the call by the Arab 
League as interference in Yemen's internal affairs. The sources 
went on to say that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is currently facing 
internal problems in Sanaa, arising from the losses incurred by 
his armed forces and their defeat due to the blows they received 
from the heroic armed forces representing national accord, 
unity, and democracy.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, </F>
in Aden, by MBC correspondent Ahmad Manjuna on 9 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Manjuna] Can Yemen endure the ongoing fighting 
developing into a protracted war of attrition? 
  [Al-Bid] We want to implement the Pledge and Accord 
Document. 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his forces reject this. Failing to 
implement the document, they resorted to war to impose another 
course on the Yemeni people. We will all abide by the document 
around which the overwhelming majority of the Yemeni people 
rally. Even those who have been forcibly sent to the war by 
'Abdallah Salih are now fighting with low morale because they 
are not convinced about what they are doing. They do not know 
what they are doing. What are their objectives when they advance 
toward particular areas in the southern provinces? 
  [Manjuna] Brother 'Ali: How can you describe the military 
situation? And how can you hold out? 
  [Al-Bid] We will hold out. But we are convinced that whoever 
triumphs in this war will still be a loser. But what can we do? 
As long as this war is imposed on us we will defend ourselves 
and we will adhere to the course we have chosen. We have chosen 
the road of unity, democracy, civil rule, and equality. We also 
chose the Pledge and Accord Document on the basis of national 
unanimity. We will adhere to this document and we will fight to 
ensure that it is implemented. 
  [Manjuna] Despite the signing of the Pledge and Accord 
Document, the government in Sanaa accuses the southerners of 
secession and mutiny. On what grounds does the government in 
Sanaa base its accusations? 
  [Al-Bid] This is their understanding of issues and it shows 
their miscalculations. We opted for unity. We dissolved our 
regime here in the south and we took our units from here to 
Sanaa. Regrettably, they were besieged and attacked in Sanaa. 
We did not do all this. The Yemeni people know this. History 
will be the judge.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah, Lutfi Shatarah, Naji </F>
al-Harazi, Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq, and Salwa al-Ustuwani: "War 
of Conflicting Statements in Yemen"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Sanaa, Abu-Dhabi, Damascus, Aden -- 
Many questions have been asked in Arab and foreign diplomatic 
circles about Sanaa's sudden decision yesterday accepting Arab 
League mediation. Some interpreted the fact that Yemeni Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah yesterday contacted Arab 
League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid as perhaps an 
indication of a new understanding of the difficulty of settling 
the Yemeni crisis by military means, or a desire to "avoid Arab 
isolation" and to avoid charges of "arrogance of power" being 
made against the leadership in Sanaa. [passage omitted] 
  On the military front, the fighting has continued between 
the 
two sides. Sanaa sources said that north Yemeni forces have 
occupied al-'Anad airbase and opened al-Dali' road to Aden, 
which they expected to fall soon. The northern command was so 
confident yesterday that it transported a number of 
correspondents, including an AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT correspondent, to 
a point the sources said was "nearest to Aden." Probably in the 
area of al-'Alam or Dar Sa'd, but there has been no confirmation 
of that. 
  Commenting on that, a highly placed Socialist Party [YSP] 
source said that that was part of the media campaign aimed at 
weaking the morale of the southern forces. He wondered why 
Sanaa neglected to mention the battles against al-'Amaliqah 
units in the Abyan Governorate, where access to Aden is much 
easier than access through al-Dali' road in the Lahij 
Governorate. 
  The YSP source stressed that it would be impossible for the 
northern forces to reach Aden. He also denied that the al-'Anad 
airbase (in the Lahij Governorate) had fallen to these forces. 
He said the southern forces had secured the al-Dali' road after 
wiping out a northern battalion that was moving from Mukayris 
(in the north of the Abyan Governorate) to Lawdar (in the 
center) to reinforce al-'Amaliqah forces. He added that another 
battalion was destroyed as it tried to escape to al-Rahah area 
near al-Kabsi camp where remnants of the northern 2nd Armored 
Brigade are situated. 
  Another source said that southern forces deployed in the 
area 
between Karish and Mukayris captured a number of tanks and an 
entire infantry battalion and were advancing towards Ta'izz, and 
also that the artillery brigade in Yarim joined the Basuhayb 
Brigade and in doing so completely blocked the al-Dali' road in 
the face of the northern forces trying to advance on Aden. The 
source added that the situation in Aden was calm today and that 
employees have returned to their offices. 
  As far as fighting in the Abyan Governorate against 
al-'Amaliqah forces is concerned, southern sources said they 
expected the battles there to be decided today, now that the 
town of Zinjibar was under control with the northern units 
retreating towards al-'Urqub. [passage omitted] 
  The sources said that the delay in settling the situation in 
Abyan was due to the fact that the northern forces used Iraqi 
fighting expertise and used tactics unknown to the southern 
forces, such as withdrawing from an area after mining it and 
then storming it heavily after the entry of southern light 
forces (infantry and militia), and also due to the fact that 
low-flying aircraft were mistaken by the southerners for their 
own until they suddenly started to bomb them, which hampered the 
liquidation of al-'Amaliqah pockets there. [passage omitted] 
  Eyewitnesses in Aden yesterday saw 30 southern aircraft 
taking off in the direction of the positions of al-'Amaliqah in 
the Abyan Governorate. Western diplomats said that was going to 
be the "decisive battle to expel the northern forces from the 
south." Southern sources say that an Eritrean pilot, an Iraqi 
pilot, and an Egyptian pilot from the extremist groups were 
being interrogated and will be shown to the Arab League 
delegation. Aden television showed a family of 11, five of them 
killed by indiscriminate northern shelling of al-Sharj.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 May (MENA)--Ambassador Nayif Sa'ud al-Qadi, 
Jordan's permanent representative to the Arab League and 
chairman of the current Arab League Council emergency session on 
the Yemeni crisis, has denied media reports of differences 
between the Yemeni leadership and the Arab League Council 
regarding the convening of the emergency session to discuss an 
end to the recent fighting there. 
  He told MENA that in a telephone conversation with Arab 
League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, the Yemeni 
foreign minister welcomed the Arab League Council decision to 
continue its efforts and contacts to stop the fighting between 
the sons of the homeland. The Yemeni foreign minister's 
statement that the Yemeni crisis is an internal affair, as cited 
by news media, does not mean a rejection of the Arab League's 
help in ending the fighting, he said. 
  The ambassador said the Arab League is continuing its 
contacts with the Yemeni and Arab leaders in an attempt to stop 
the bloodshed. He said Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah has agreed to receive a delegation from the Arab 
League Secretariat headed by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, the 
assistant Arab League secretary general for military affairs. 
  Asked about reports that Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid had requested Jordanian mediation to stop the fighting, 
al-Qadi said he has no information about this. He noted that 
Jordan has continued to call on the Yemeni leaders to begin 
negotiations and renounce force as a means to solve differences. 
He pointed to Jordan's role in signing the Pledge and Accord 
Document, which he described as the best option of the Yemeni 
people to solve differences and preserve a unified Yemen. 
  The Jordanian ambassador hoped the brothers in Yemen will 
come to their senses and stop battles as soon as possible so 
that differences can be solved through dialogue and 
understanding.

  [Text] The House of Representatives held a session this 
morning under the speakership of brother Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar and in the presence of Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah. The foreign minister explained to the 
House the actions taken by brother Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas, the prime minister, on his medical and tourist trip, 
as well as his contacts and telephone conversations abroad with 
Arab and other officials. These contacts included the Arab 
League secretary general, the UN secretary general, certain 
Yemeni ambassadors, and our Arab League permanent 
representative. The foreign minister explained that al-'Attas 
exploited his position as prime minister by holding these 
contacts and asking for an Arab League peace-keeping force, thus 
allowing for the violation of our national sovereignty and 
national independence, when what is taking place in our country 
is no more than a war against those who have rebelled against 
constitutional legitimacy and democracy. 
  The foreign minister added that the advent of foreign troops 
to our country would undermine the sovereignty and independence 
of the country. He indicated that brother Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas is exploiting his position as prime minister in a 
manner that does not serve the homeland as much as it serves a 
party faction. Moreover, our Arab League permanent 
representative has called for peacekeeping forces without 
obtaining the Council of Ministers' approval, but at the request 
of brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, who has not received the 
approval of the Council of Ministers or the Foreign Ministry. 
Had our permanent representative believed in the homeland's 
interest, he would not have received his instructions from the 
prime minister, who is on a tourist trip abroad. 
  The brother foreign minister said the Arab League Council -- 
thanks to our national, candid, clear, and firm stand -- was 
satisfied with the adoption of a decision, whose most important 
point was the Arab League Council's reaffirmation of the 
statement it issued in March supporting Yemeni unity without 
reservation. 
  The House then discussed in detail the illegitimate foreign 
moves and activities of the brother prime minister, who is 
abroad on a medical trip. The House members approved the 
following House draft resolution: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  Resolution by the House of Representatives: 
  During its session today, Monday, 29 Dhu al-Qi'dah 1414 
Hegira, corresponding to 9 May 1994, the House of 
Representatives discussed the moves and contacts made by brother 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, and the political 
activities accompanying them in his official capacity as prime 
minister although he traveled for medical purposes and was not 
assigned with any official mission by the Presidential Council 
or the Council of Ministers. Since his talks, contacts, and 
statements deal with domestic Yemeni affairs and violate Article 
110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen, which states 
that the role of the chairman of the Council of Ministers is 
confined to implementing the Council of Ministers' decisions and 
the state's general policy in a coordinated and unified manner; 
and in view of what is entailed by these contacts and moves in 
terms of negative repercussions that are detrimental to the 
sovereignty, independence, and supreme interests of Yemen, the 
House has decided the following: 
  1. His contacts and statements are totally null and void due 
to their violation of constitutional legitimacy in accordance 
with Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen. 
Moreover, any contacts or moves outside the framework of the 
constitutional institutions by any official or politician in the 
state are considered null and void and entail no legal 
commitment whatsoever. 
  2. The executive authority should implement the House 
resolution, communicate it to other states and international 
bodies and organizations, and adopt the necessary measures in 
accordance with the Constitution. May God grant us success. 
  Brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam Khalid Karman, minister of legal 
and House of Representatives affairs, attended today's session.

  [Text] A responsible source at the office of Council of 
Ministers Chairman Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has made a 
statement to the Yemeni news agency, SABA'. He said in the 
statement that there have been successive improvised and biased 
decisions from 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the latest of which is a 
decision announced through the Sanaa news media to suspend Prime 
Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and to charge another person 
to carry out his duties. Earlier 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih issued a 
number of decisions suspending Defense Minister Haytham Qasim 
Tahir, Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, minister of oil and mineral 
resources, and Aden Governor Salih Munassar al-Syayli. 
  The source said this type of decision reflects the state of 
bewilderment experienced by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih after his 
ill-fated decision to drown Yemen in a bloody war. He pointed 
out that these decisions not only contradict the Constitution 
which he trampled under foot when he declared the war, but also 
reflect the psychology of defeat which has controlled his mind 
following the setbacks suffered by the forces of his gang in 
more than one military position. He is now trying to patch up 
his shaky position before those he promised to occupy Aden 
within a few hours. 
  The source confirmed that these decisions have been rejected 
in their entirety because they violate the Constitution and go 
against it. He clarified that confidence in the prime minister 
can only be withdrawn by the house of deputies. The ministers 
cannot be dismissed except publicly and with the prime 
minister's consent. When this occurs or when the prime minister 
resigns himself, the entire Council of Ministers must be 
considered as having resigned. 
  The source wondered: What can we expect from the man who 
ignited the war, the strife, and the civil war? What can we 
expect from the man who directs his guns against the citizens 
and children and stabs at the very heart of unity? What can we 
expect other than these stupid decisions through which he is 
implementing his secessionist goals. 
  The source ridiculed such decisions and said they have no 
impact whatsoever after the war decision adopted by 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih. He pointed out that these decisions are 
additions to the declaration of war by means of which he 
announced the liquidation of unity and the liquidation of 
everything that would remind him of it. 
  The source concluded by saying that all the decisions issued 
by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih are constitutionally invalid and are 
(?capricious) and unrecognized. He said that the theatrical 
farce being implemented by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his gang 
after the war decision cannot fool anybody, particularly as he 
cancelled the legitimacy of unity and adopted a secessionist 
decision by declaring war on 27 April. It is a decision he will 
not be permitted to achieve because unity is the will of the 
people, and they will defend it to the last breath of life.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with "Prime Minister" Haydar Abu-Bakr </F>
al-'Attas, in Washington, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo; date not 
given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Engineer al-'Attas: How do you view 
developments in Yemen? 
  [Al-'Attas] It is regrettable to see such events taking 
place 
in Yemen. It is a war among brothers. Since the start of the 
political crisis last year, we have repeatedly warned against 
these events. We would like to emphasize that war is not the 
proper option or the suitable way to remedy problems. War will 
settle no issue; it will only spell destruction for the Yemeni 
people, which will affect every citizen. During the political 
dialogue, there has been an agreement in principle to define the 
main points of consensus, not to resort to violence or take up 
arms to tackle the existing problems, and to adopt political and 
democratic dialogue as an alternative. Unfortunately, and 
despite the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document, the 
brothers in Sanaa, particularly the leadership represented by 
the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Reform Party, have 
persistently prevaricated over this issue and avoided 
implementing the Pledge and Accord Document. Instead, they 
opted for military confrontation as an alternative to the 
political and democratic dialogue. To enter a war is difficult. 
To get out of it is even more difficult. War could break out 
because of a thoughtless and hasty decision. But it is very 
difficult to get out of it. The situation cannot be decided 
militarily. There is indiscriminate bombardment by the brothers 
in Sanaa. Perhaps you have seen on television villages, 
children, and women being hit. I believe that serious action 
must be taken to end the war and resume the dialogue to tackle 
the problems facing Yemen. 
  [Al-Jundi] Engineer al-'Attas: Both sides, in the North and 
South, have repeatedly voiced their support for Yemen's unity 
and vowed not to give it up. Is the ongoing war between the 
northern and southern troops for the sake of unity or is it a 
war to end the unity? 
  [Al-'Attas] No war could be for the sake of unity. Military 
action is always against unity, because it results in rifts and 
problems and influences the political and moral elements that 
sway the feelings of the masses. Thus we have stated that any 
kind of military action is against unity and democratic 
practices. Nobody is thinking of seceding; this is not on the 
cards. The Pledge and Accord Document is the remedy that we 
have reached after an extensive political dialogue. The 
document remedies two basic points. The first is the current 
problems, particularly the military and security problems, and 
the second is the future of the regime and the state. But it is 
clear that there was rejection of this document from the day it 
was signed, despite the official signature on it and claims to 
the contrary. All actions prove that they are against it. They 
resorted to the military option by first striking at the 5th 
Brigade in the area of [name indistinct] in February immediately 
after the document was signed. 
  [Al-Jundi] Some observers say the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] started the political crisis in the first place, when Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid decided to stay in Aden. As a YSP 
official, how do you see the issue? 
  [Al-'Attas] This is not true. The crisis really started from 
the beginning of the unity, when the brothers in Sanaa 
disregarded the unity agreements, the small issues agreed upon 
to make this great Yemeni dream a reality. When these issues 
were ignored and the model of the Yemeni Arab Republic [North 
Yemen before unity] was imposed, the attempt to control 
everything and keep everything centralized in Sanaa. [sentence 
as heard]. 
  [Al-Jundi] Some observers whisper that you, a prominent 
official in the YSP, were in Washington when the war started and 
that Salim Salih Muhammad, who is the YSP assistant secretary, 
was in London, that is, both of you were out of Yemen. Is there 
any significance in this? 
  [Al-'Attas] First, brother Salim Salih went on an official 
mission to Arab countries and then stopped over in London. More 
visits were scheduled on his program. He intends to follow the 
program. As for me, I travelled abroad for treatment for acute 
pain in my spinal cord, which affected my right leg and hand. I 
attended the Cabinet meetings in Aden and in Ta'izz and took 
part in the meetings of the dialogue committee while suffering 
this extreme pain. Following the Ta'izz meetings, I left the 
country on 12 April, that is, before the crisis broke out. On 
27 April, the brothers in Sanaa decided to initiate a military 
action when the president delivered a speech that day at the 
(?al-Sab'in) Square, giving the signal to start the war. The 
war started with a strike against the 3d Brigade, a southern 
brigade, in the area of 'Imran. This was followed by an attack 
against the Ba Suhayb Brigade in the area of (?Zamar). Despite 
the efforts we exerted within the Cabinet, at every meeting we 
faced problems obstructing the work of the Cabinet and 
preventing it from making any decision to implement the Pledge 
and Accord Document. 
  [Al-Jundi] After Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid and Yemeni 
Defense Minister Haytham Qasim Tahir's dismissal, do you intend 
to return to Sanaa or to Aden when you finish your medical 
treatment in Washington? Will you take up your job as Yemeni 
prime minister? 
  [Al-'Attas] First, the decisions made by parliament and the 
president are invalid, unlawful, and have absolutely no basis. 
This is because they disregarded the Pledge and Accord 
Document, which represents the core of national consensus, as 
well as everything else. Thus they are unconstitutional, 
invalid, and null and void. The Constitution gives no one the 
right to dismiss any person within the government. It gives 
parliament the right to withdraw confidence from the government. 
But this is not what parliament did. 
  [Al-Jundi] Parliament dismissed al-Bid. 
  [Al-'Attas] It had no right. There is nothing in the 
Constitution that says parliament is entitled to dismiss people. 
There is absolutely no clause in the Constitution that gives 
parliament the right to dismiss any member of the Presidential 
Council or government. Absolutely not. There is no such 
provision. These decisions are illegitimate and secessionist. 
They seek to consecrate the problem and the current military 
situation and to militarize the state, the machine the Pledge 
and Accord Document has tried to tackle. The document tried to 
build a modern and civic state, disengage the state and the 
military, and disengage the state and the tribes, so that a 
modern state could be established with equal rights given to all 
its citizens. 
  [Al-Jundi] We thank our guest Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al- 
'Attas on the line with us from Washington, where he is 
receiving treatment. We thank him.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces, today chaired a meeting of the Defense 
Ministry Command and the General Staff Command, in the presence 
of brother Yahya al-Mutawakkil, the minister of interior, and 
Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur, the minister of 
defense. 
  At the outset, the brother supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces congratulated brother struggler Brig. Gen. 'Abd-Rabbuh 
Mansur on his appointment as defense minister of the Republic of 
Yemen. He stressed his confidence in the competence and 
capability of the brother, struggler, hero defense minister, in 
commanding the Armed Forces of the Republic of Yemen and 
consolidating its heroic role in defending the unity of the 
Yemeni homeland and crushing the remnants of apostasy and 
secession -- those who have sold their conscience, lost the 
honor of belonging to their homeland, and been carried away 
behind their evil whims and ambitions, not caring about the 
consequences of their acts, namely, sabotaging the homeland, 
depleting its forces, and destroying its resources, which were 
built by the sweat of the masses. 
  The brother chairman urged the commanders of military units 
and the personnel of the Defense Ministry Command and the 
General Staff Command to cooperate with the Defense Ministry and 
implement its orders, which aim at enhancing the heroic 
abilities of our Armed Forces -- the forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy -- which are continuing to achieve 
successive victories, repulsing heroically and crushingly the 
remnants of apostasy, secession, and rebellion against 
legitimacy. 
  The brother chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces paid tribute to the efficiency and heroic, splendid 
performance of the noncommissioned officers, officers, and 
troops of our Armed Forces on all axes of fighting and national 
struggle in defense of the unity of the homeland and its pure 
soil. 
  The brother chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces pointed out the importance of coordinating efforts in an 
integral way with the agencies of the Interior Ministry. This 
is meant to enable these agencies to carry out their effective 
national role in maintaining the security and safety of the 
citizens, safeguarding public funds and property, and 
confronting any phenomena that seek to infringe on the citizen's 
safety and funds and any attempt to create disorder. He also 
urged these agencies to strike with an iron fist at any party 
that tries to tamper with the security of the homeland and to 
maintain the community's safety. 
  The brother struggler, Brig. Gen. 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur, the 
defense minister, thanked and appreciated the precious 
confidence of brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of 
the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, asserting his faith in God and in the ability of the 
heroes of our Armed Forces to achieve the hopes pinned on them 
by their people in defending the unity of the homeland and 
defeating all the attempts of the gang of apostasy and secession 
and its schemes that aim at fragmenting and destroying the 
homeland. He stressed that our valiant Armed Forces will always 
remain the sword in the hand of the people and its 
constitutional institutions in the face of any party that 
tampers with the security and achievements of the homeland, 
primarily, unity and democracy.

  [Text] Staff Brigadier General brother 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur 
Hadi, the defense minister, this morning convened a meeting at 
the ministry with Staff Brig. Gen. brother 'Abd-al-Malik 
al-Sayyani, chief of the General Staff; his deputies; the 
defense minister's advisers; and ministry department heads. 
  The chief of the General Staff began by congratulating 
brother Mansur Hadi on his appointment as defense minister and 
the trust placed in him by brother Lieutenant Gen. 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential Council chairman and commander 
in chief of the Armed Forces. The chief of staff told the 
brother minister that he can count on the cooperation of 
everyone to advance national unity and constitutional legitimacy 
and to stand up to all forces of apostasy and secession who are 
out to plunge the Armed Forces into a bloody war to promote 
their despicable plans and sick dreams. Brig. Gen. al-Sayyani 
went on to emphasize that what the apostate separatists are 
after is to tear the united Yemen asunder and set it back to the 
pre-22 May, 1990 era. 
  The chief of staff declared that under the kind of decisive 
circumstances the homeland is going through now, the Ministry of 
Defense and the General Staff Command have ahead of them a 
formidable task. Granted, he said, ours is a demanding mission, 
but by our cooperation and boundless confidence in the 
capabilities of the brother minister, which we have come to know 
first-hand throughout his service, should make its achievement 
possible. Brig. Gen. al-Sayyani praised the defense minister's 
performance as commander of the al-Bayda' axis, where he and the 
military distinguished themselves in battle against the forces 
of apostasy and secession, and accomplished their mission with 
minimal losses. 
  The chief of staff stressed that the forces of unity and 
legality are following up on their successes in al-Bayda' and 
elsewhere with further gains against the treasonous and apostate 
gangs led by secessionists in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party. 
They are fulfilling their assignments with admirable 
proficiency in Abyan, al-Dali', Lahij, and Aden, and elsewhere 
on the battlefront. 
  For his part, Brig. Gen. 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi said he 
took 
pride in the confidence placed in him by Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih. He said he will extend every cooperation to his brothers 
at the General Staff Command and army commanders to translate 
this confidence into physical reality. The brother minister 
applauded the distinguished performance of the Armed Forces who, 
he said, are now engaged in fierce combat with the Socialist 
Party's gangs of apostasy and secession. He noted their 
remarkable steadfastness and successes in the field as they 
upheld the will of the people for unity, democracy, and 
constitutional legitimacy. 
  We are fighting a battle forced upon us by this tyrannical 
coterie against the wishes of the political and military 
echelons, who are anxious to spare the lives of the valiant 
military's personnel and the blood of the citizens of the united 
Yemen. We have no choice but to stand fast and fight on, the 
brother defense minister added. The forces of unity and 
legitimacy will soldier on and pound all the fortifications of 
the agent secessionists until, God willing, sure victory is 
attained.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Abu-Bakr al-Saqqaf, professor of </F>
philosophy at Sanaa University and chairman of the Constituent 
Assembly of the Human Rights Committee, in Yemen, by Salah 
Qallab, in Amman; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Qallab] It has been claimed that the 
situation will be settled militarily in the near future with the 
northern forces taking control of the Aden axis. What is your 
information, as you have been following the situation closely? 
  [Al-Saqqaf] I doubt that the situation can be settled 
quickly because there is a relative balance of forces in 
equipment and number of fighters. [passage omitted] 
  [Qallab] Sanaa says that what is taking place is an internal 
affair and that is why it rejected the Arab League's initiative. 
What, in your view, is the aim? 
  [Al-Saqqaf] Actually, the 'Imran incidents had been 
escalated with the intention of liquidating and destroying the 
southern 3d Brigade and preventing continuation of the 
Egyptian-United Arab Emirates mediation which had reached 
practical steps toward easing the military and political crisis 
and paving the way for a gneral national reconciliation and a 
peaceful solution for the entire crisis. It is not true at all 
that the southern 3d Brigade which was in 'Imran, 60 km from 
Sanaa and isolated from the southern areas, was preparing to 
attack the capital, as the Presidential Council chairman 
claimed. [passage omitted] 
  It has been proved that the attack on the Basuhayb Brigade 
last Wednesday was a prelude to the bombing of Aden last 
Thursday (two days later). It is clear from all these 
developments that the war decision was made at the end of last 
year, in December to be specific. 
  There are documents indicating that all this took place in 
agreement with Saddam Husayn. The Yemenis noticed widespread 
presence of Iraqis in the Yemeni capital Sanaa in recent months. 
We have information that there is an Iraqi military advisory 
center in al-Hasbah area in Sanaa, supervised by a high-ranking 
Iraqi officer. 
  [Qallab] Do you mean that the Iraqis are participating 
directly in the current battles? 
  [Al-Saqqaf] Yes, and we have documents proving that they 
supervised the installation of missiles on the Munif mountain 
(in al-Hajariyah mountain range). Furthermore, anyone who 
closely examines the situation would see that the main feature 
of the regime in Sanaa is modelled after the way President 
Saddam Husayn Husayn structured his regime. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report from Washington] </F>
  [Text] Informed U.S. sources have stated that the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] has communicated to the U.S. 
Administration its desire to deal with this administration in 
the future and to coordinate policies with it vis-a-vis the Gulf 
and Middle East affairs in return for supporting YSP efforts to 
secede and restore its pre-unity status. The YSP also expressed 
its readiness to grant all oil prospecting concessions to U.S. 
companies. 
  The oral message conveyed by special envoy of 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid to a U.S. official said the YSP does not oppose U.S. 
interests and fully understands the U.S. policy in the region, 
particularly the two issues of peace with Israel and the siege 
on Iraq. 
  The YSP told the U.S. Administration it will use its Air 
Force in its battle with Sanaa and asked the administration not 
to misinterpret this step because it is part of the secessionist 
attempt which requires a military battle after which all 
attempts at reconciliation or pressure on the southerners to 
abandon their secessionist plan will subside. 
  In the past, the YSP has received large sums of foreign 
financial aid.

  [Text] According to eye witness reports, many headquarters 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] in the governorates of 
Ta'izz, Ibb, Sanaa, Dhamar, Hajjah, Sa'dah, Mahwit, and 
al-Hudaydah have been taken over and converted to centers for 
detaining YSP members, other patriotic and democratic parties 
supporting it, and members of the gang of the al-Ahmar clan who 
support the pledge and accord document. 
  These reports further state that ambushes are being laid for 
YSP members who are heading for their party centers. They are 
deceived into entering the centers and are then detained. 
Reports by people coming from the northern governorates say 
that this same method is being used on members of other parties 
participating in the dialogue committee, outside the [word

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 8 May -- "We are making every effort to 
carry out, should the need arise, the rapid and organized 
evacuation from dangerous parts of Yemen of all Russian citizens 
working on contracts in that country," Viktor Posuvalyuk, 
director of the Africa and Near East Department of the Foreign 
Ministry of the Russian Federation told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent in a telephone conversation. He said that 113 
people had already arrived by plane in Moscow from Djibouti, 
which borders on Yemen, after being brought there on the French 
warship, Jules Verne. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry, says the Russian diplomat, is 
in constant contact with its colleagues from France. Should the 
situation worsen in Aden in the south of the country, we have 
obtained the agreement of Paris to bring out as many Russians as 
possible from there on a warship which is due to approach the 
port of Aden in the near future. Our consul general in the town 
has been given exhaustive instructions in this regard. As for 
the country's capital, Sanaa, we have plans to bring Russians 
out overland to the port of Al Hudaydah where our ship the 
Khudozhnik Kustodiyev is waiting. Although Sanaa airport is, 
according to our information, besieged and the situation there 
is unsafe, the Russian leadership has allocated two passenger 
planes which are ready to fly out there for our people if the 
situation is permits.

  [Excerpt] London, 10 May (KUNA) -- In a press statement 
published here today, Yemeni Oil [and Mineral Resources] 
Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun said that the oil sector 
has not yet been affected by the military operations and that 
the sector's activities of production and exports, and even 
refining, are continuing in a normal and usual way. 
  Bin-Husaynun added to the AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT newspaper that 
export operations are taking place at the same previous rates; 
however, he did not specify the size of exports. The Yemeni 
minister denied that foreign oil companies have evacuated their 
foreign employees. He pointed out that these companies know that 
oil regions are far away from military operations, though 
prolonging the war may affect the trust of foreign investors, 
particularly in the oil sector. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Head of government Mokdad Sifi has given an 
exclusive interview to today's LE PARISIEN, in which he has 
reiterated Algeria's hope in all its sons. 
  Concerning the security situation, the head of government 
has 
reaffirmed that the security forces are in control of all 
regions, despite an increase in provocative acts at times. He 
asserted that anything else is merely propaganda and biased 
interpretations. 
  The head of government has stressed Algeria's respect for 
human rights and pointed out that instructions had been given to 
the security forces to avoid the pitfall of abuses. 
  Replying to a question regarding what Algeria was expecting 
from France, Sifi said: Everything of concern to Algeria should 
be of concern to France. It is in the interest of France to 
help Algeria, because our country's problems, if not checked, 
will have repercussions in the Arab Maghreb and France. Once 
the situation stabilizes, Algeria will be one of the biggest 
markets for France and Europe. 
  Concerning the Algerian expatriate community in France, the 
head of the government said it is possible for such a 
community--it is its duty--to play an important role. Our 
citizens should play a role in the management of the country, he 
added. 
  As far as the political issues in the country are concerned, 
Sifi has affirmed that dialogue is continuing with Algerians, 
who jealously support the unity of the people and the homeland. 
His government has no right, however, to choose a political 
model for the society. Hence, it is not right for any political 
minority to impose its will upon others, he added.

  [Excerpts] The Algerian Fraternity in France, which is 
considered to be very close to the Islamic Salvation Front, has 
strongly condemned the killing in Algeria of two French 
religious figures. For officials of the fraternity, this double 
killing is probably the work of the enemies of Algeria. It is 
provocation. 
  It is the case that 34 foreign nationals, including 10 
French 
citizens, have so far been killed in Algeria since September. 
Jerome Bony and Bruno Giraudon, our special correspondents in 
Algiers, report: 
  [Bony] People are dismayed in Algiers' Casbah after the 
killing yesterday of Paule-Helene Saint-Raymond and Henri 
Verges. Among those who miss the two religious figures most and 
who dare to say so is the imam of the neighboring mosque: 
  [Begin unidentified imam recording] They were people who 
helped the needy. They were on the side of the needy. Some 
people needed them to fill in forms for retirement in France. 
They came to see them for help. They asked them to write 
letters to the social security services in France. They did 
favors for everyone, both men and women, without any 
distinction. Without any distinction among human beings. 
[passage omitted] We are asking God ... [pauses] These people 
must be exterminated with God's help. This is all I can say. 
[end recording] 
  [Bony] Yesterday, after the killings, the Casbah district 
was 
cordoned off by the police and, according to information we 
gathered on the ground this morning, four young people are 
believed to have been arrested. More police operations are 
taking place in Algiers right now, but it is impossible to say 
who are those behind the double killing of Sister Paule and 
Brother Henri, who will be buried here, in Algiers, soon.

  [Excerpts] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Reliable Algerian sources 
confirmed to AL-HAYAH yesterday that the large-scale military 
changes announced by President Major General Liamine Zeroual 
fall within the framework of bolstering the march to be staged 
on Sunday in support of dialogue. The sources said that most of 
the generals appointed in zone commands and the General Staff 
"are advocates of dialogue, or at least, have adopted no 
positions on it." The sources stressed that these generals are 
loyal to Maj. Gen. Zeroual, who is also the defense minister. 
[passage omitted] 
  The sources said that these changes means the beginning of 
President Zeroual's real rule. The march to be staged on Sunday 
will grant him a popular legitimacy he still lacks. The sources 
pointed out that the replacement of Gen. Abdelhamid Djaouadi, 
commander of the 5th zone (Constantine), confirms the decision 
to reduce the powers of those advocating "all-out 
confrontation." However, other sources said that his dismissal 
is part of the decision to punish those who were accused of 
negligence in connection with the great escape from Tazoult 
prison, which involved over 900 prisoners. 
  The sources stress that these changes are a prelude to 
further changes in the next stage.

  [Text] Here is the full text of the speech by Prime 
Minister Mokdad Sifi at today's inauguration ceremony of the 
National Economic and Social Council. 
  [Begin Sifi recording] In the name of God, the 
Compassionate, 
the Merciful. Thank you Mr. President. Mr. President, chairman 
of the Consultative Council, ladies and gentlemen ministers, 
ladies and gentlemen. May God's peace, compassion, and 
blessings be upon you. 
  I am honored and pleased to join you today at the 
inauguration of the National Economic and Social Council 
[al-majlis al-watani al-iqtisadi wa al-ijtima'i] 
  On this occasion I present to you, on behalf of the head of 
state and the government, my warm congratulations for everyone's 
choice and the trust put in you. I also express to the 
organizations and institutions which appointed you my 
satisfaction with the constructive spirit and broad view they 
expressed during the consultations which brought them together 
with the government on setting up this Council, which has a 
special importance. 
  The installation of the National Economic and Social 
Council, 
which will be followed by the National Transitional Council, is 
a symbol of the break with past practice, which we hope to 
instill, and is proof of our eagerness to engage in open 
consultation with all the participants in national life. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the state, while opting for opening up 
to its economic and social partners in order to create this 
council, affirms its desire to ensure the actual participation 
of all sections of society in order to take charge over the 
future of our country. 
  I am convinced that this opening up of our state to society, 
the choice of competence, and giving the necessary opportunities 
to our youth, will be a starting point toward the better 
management of our country's affairs. Thanks to your ideas and 
the suggestions which you submit to the government, we will 
continually consolidate and deepen the citizens' contribution to 
preparing the social and economic decisions which concern them 
and define their future. I hereby affirm the government's 
eagerness for the development of this consultation so as to take 
charge of coordinating the economic reforms which will be 
witnessed by the country, and for the revival of national 
development, which will benefit large sections of our people. 
This was the concept stressed by the head of state recerntly 
before the Council of ministers, and which is related to the 
need to give necessary attention to promoting national 
solidarity and social justice. 
  At the same time, great attention will be given to those 
sectors financing the economy, such as the hydrocarbons sector 
or those which comply with economic growth, and society's needs 
such as agriculture, housing, and small and medium industries. 
Our national development will remain characterized by social 
justice and the state's contribution in parallel with the 
reforms, which aim at improving efficiency and freeing creative 
initiatives. Better than that, this development will be further 
consolidated through extended consultation with all 
representatives of society, and in this lies the final split 
with the spirit of monopoly, whatever its nature. 
  In this respect, the composition of your council provides a 
better framework to identify the real points of strength and 
weaknesses of our country, and to collectively identify the best 
ways and means which enable Algeria to fully utilize its actual 
resources. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, at a time when our country embarks on 
profound reforms and the international arena, when we experience 
fast and profound changes -- from which the economic, 
technological, and scientific domains cannot escape, your 
council represents a considerable achievement to promote the 
interests of our country and people. Indeed, in parallel with 
the revival of the national economy, Algeria has to open up 
economically toward the outside world in order to occupy its 
real status within the international exchange. 
  On the other hand, it is imperative for our country, 
especially when youth constitutes the majority of its 
population, and especially now, to be concerned with the future 
perception of its development in order to ensure a respected 
future for the rising generations through the promotion of 
efforts and the exploitation of creative energies that are the 
sources for good and prosperity. 
  Such ideas, which have now acquired a wide and permanent 
framework through your council, underline to our people, 
regardless of the passing difficulties, that the hope of 
restoring its perpetual prosperity in a stable country, one 
respected by other nations, is a legitimate hope. It is because 
Algeria of the eternal November revolution still has plenty of 
the necessary energies to face up to all challenges. 
  All of this underscores the significance and vastness of the 
hopes pinned on this council, which will be concerned with 
fundamental national issues. The nation is awaiting rich ideas 
from you, ideas that will emanate from the diversity of your 
specializations and qualifications, and the state is awaiting 
from you reformist proposals. 
  I would like to stress, on behalf of the head of state, in 
my 
own name, and on behalf of the government, that we highly 
appreciate your brave commitment to serve the nation at this 
very time; the time when Algeria has to depend on its loyal 
children, who will never leave or abandon it. Before this heavy 
burden and great responsibility is laid on your shoulders, I 
cannot but wish you every success and righteousness, and stress 
to you my absolute support. 
  I have the honor to officially announce the installation of 
the Social and Economic National Council. May God help us all 
to accomplish everything that brings good, pride, and prosperity 
to Algeria. Peace be upon you and God's compassion and 
blessings. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Vice President Zuhayr Mashariqah by </F>
correspondent Sana' al-Sa'id in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Sa'id] The American campaign against Syria, 
which resulted recently in putting Syria on the list of states 
that have failed to assist in the fight against drugs, is very 
odd. Many believe that it is unfair. How do you view that 
campaign? 
  [Mashariqah] The campaign some elements in the U.S. 
Administration launched against Syria was undoubtedly unfair. 
It sought to inflict harm on Syria and its policy through 
accusing it of failure to fight drugs. It also aimed to destroy 
Syrian-American relations and put pressure on Syria to dissuade 
it from taking the stance it is assuming on the peace process 
and its fixed principles. That campaign sought also to belittle 
the outcome of the Geneva summit meeting between Presidents 
al-Asad and Clinton and inhibit the impetus it gave to the peace 
process. 
  The manifest fact is that Syria is making efforts in 
cooperation with the Lebanese authorities to fight poppy and 
other drug farming, particularly in the Lebanese area of 
al-Biqa'. Syria has issued many legislations and laws to fight 
drugs, including the infliction of the severest punishments on 
whoever farms, manufactures, or smuggles narcotics. Syria's 
drug-fighting efforts seemed very satisfying to the United 
Nations, as represented in the regional committee on fighting 
drugs, which selected Damascus as a venue for its 30th session. 
The committee's representative saw that Syria's drug-fighting 
efforts are worthy of praise. 
  The goal of this campaign is to put pressure on Syria and 
force it to relinquish its solid stance and just issues, which 
were recognized by international legitimacy, that seek to 
establish a just and comprehensive peace in the region. But 
Syria's stance and its just claims cannot be the subject of 
one-upmanship. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Can this campaign be viewed as a sign of pressure 
on Syria, particularly since it was launched just before 
Christopher's tour of the region? 
  [Mashariqah] Putting Syria's name on the list of states that 
fail to fight drugs is merely extortion to drive it to accept 
Israeli conditions in the peace process. Syria always 
reiterates that it rejects extortion and will not tolerate 
one-upmanship when it comes to its basic issues. There is no 
way that Syria will relinquish its rights; it is determined to 
hold on to basic principles concerning Arab rights and claims. 
Pressure will only enhance Syria's insistence on these rights 
and on defending them. All methods and pressure will not succeed 
to force it off its course or make it back down on its approach 
to defend Arab rights and issues. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The Geneva summit, held between presidents Hafiz 
al-Asad and Clinton on 16 January, managed to shed light on the 
fact that the Syrian role is the key to peace in the Middle 
East. How can the obstacles placed by Israel to block a 
comprehensive and just peace in the region be overcome? 
  [Mashariqah] The success of the Geneva summit in January 
between presidents al-Asad and Clinton was great. It drew the 
attention of various Arab and world political circles and it was 
reported by all print and broadcast media in detail. These 
media focused on the summit's effectiveness and positive results. 
  President al-Asad went to Geneva to remove Zionism's 
allegations and falsifications that cast doubt on Syria's desire 
for peace. He stressed that a just and comprehensive peace is 
an irreversible strategic option for Syria. 
  The Geneva summit has turned over a new page in the 
bilateral 
relations between Damascus and Washington and enhanced the great 
role of Syria and its president. The U.S. President became 
certain that Syria's pan-Arab role is unique and that Syria's 
influence in events at the regional level cannot be bypassed. 
The summit's atmosphere was positive and the Americans asserted 
that they will make sincere efforts to achieve a tangible 
progress in the peace process. 
  Obviously, Israel did not like the atmosphere that prevailed 
at the summit or the results. So it began to raise doubts, 
disseminate fabricated lies, and show reservations to circumvent 
the outcome of the Geneva summit, absolve itself from the 
requirements of the peace process, and diminish the world's 
serious stance on achieving a just and comprehensive peace in 
the region, especially that of the United States. 
  Syria has always stressed its enthusiasm about the peace 
process and ensuring that it achieves its goals by bringing 
about a just and comprehensive peace that will restore Arab 
rights and territories. As far as Syria is concerned, peace is 
an irreversible strategic option. If the United States makes a 
sincere effort to make tangible progress in the peace process, 
as President Clinton promised at the Geneva summit, and plays 
the role of an impartial mediator, the process can achieve its 
desired goals according to international legitimacy resolutions. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What about the methods the Israeli Government 
uses in its dealings with the peace process? 
  [Mashariqah] The methods of the Israeli Government affirm 
that it tends to stall, delay, and weasel its way out of 
discussing the basic issues that lead to establishing a just and 
permanent peace and that were stipulated by the principles of 
international legitimacy and the UN resolutions. This peace is 
based on retrieving the occupied Arab territories and the 
national rights of the Palestinian Arab people. In addition, 
the current attempts to proceed with partial and unilateral 
solutions could create obstacles before a just and comprehensive 
peace is realized, which was the objective of the Madrid 
conference and the negotiations that followed it in Washington. 
The maneuvers and practices of the Israeli Government are 
preventing the establishment of the desired peace. If the 
Israeli Government continues its methods, it will make these 
real opportunities for peace hit a dead end. 
  Syria wants peace. What is important now is to use logic in 
all matters. Logic dictates that we have an international 
resolution that stipulates a full Israeli withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights. Syria adheres to the peace process in accordance 
with the bases and grounds of the Madrid peace process. These 
bases concentrate on international legitimacy represented in 
Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as the land-for-peace formula. 
  [Al-Sa'id] There are some sides rushing to normalize 
relations with Israel and lift the boycott before establishing 
peace. What do you think about this? 
  [Mashariqah] The Arab boycott of Israel was an Arab decision 
made by the Arab League at that time to confront Israel's 
aggressive policy and expansionist ambitions. If this decision 
is to be reviewed, only the side that passed it can do so when 
it finds a need for this. The reality is that the reasons that 
the boycott decision was made still exist. The Arab territories 
are occupied, national rights are usurped, and Israel does not 
want to establish just and comprehensive peace in accordance 
with the international legitimacy resolutions. In the 
Washington peace talks, it is resorting to procrastination, 
deception, and wasting time. At the same time, it continues to 
build its settlements and commit crimes and massacres, one after 
the other, against the Arab citizens in the occupied 
territories. It wants land and peace. It wants peace for 
peace. This is how it wants to normalize relations with the 
Arabs. It wants control and influence. It wants to hegemonize 
over the Arab region and control its resources. It wants to 
realize its strategies in any way possible so that the whole 
Arab region will submit to it in the end. What stands in the 
way of Israel's dreams is Syria's firm and principled stance in 
confronting its maneuvers and tricks, as well as its adherence 
to the basic principles of the peace process, which stem from 
international legitimacy and implementation of the latter's 
resolutions. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Inter-Arab disarray has weakened the position of 
Arab negotiators with Israel. In your view, how can solidarity 
be restored among Arabs? 
  [Mashariqah] Disarray has indeed weakened the position of 
Arab negotiators. This is what Israel has been eager to achieve 
so that it could negotiate with this or that Arab side alone, 
wrestle as many concessions as it could, strip the peace process 
of the required momentum, and shatter the hopes peace-loving 
elements in the region and in the world have pinned on that 
process. From the outset, Syria has been careful to sustain 
Arab solidarity and keep up coordination among the negotiating 
Arab delegations. It believed in the need for a comprehensive 
and just solution that guarantees the restoration of Arab rights 
and lands as a natural prologue for stability and peace in the 
region. Syria has not ceased to exert sincere efforts to 
restore Arab solidarity. This solidarity enhances the position 
of Arab negotiators and foils Israel's procrastination, which 
seeks to ruin the peaceful process. 
  [Al-Sa'id] How do you view Israel's attempt to promote a 
Middle Eastern market through which it can control the region? 
  [Mashariqah] Since it was planted in the heart of the Arab 
homeland, Israel has pursued an aggressive expansionist policy 
and a strategy that seeks to control the entire Arab region with 
its political, economic, military, and cultural capabilities. 
Nothing has changed in Israel's policy and strategy. Its talk 
about peace is just a maneuver. Israel does not want peace; it 
is far from binding itself to the principles of a just and 
comprehensive peace as specified by the resolutions of 
international legitimacy. It is trying to make negotiations 
lose their vigor; it wastes time and effort at the Washington 
talks to make the process lose its momentum. Israel wants to 
normalize relations with Arabs and wants peace for peace. In 
other words, it wants Arabs to surrender to its will because it 
wants land and peace, control and influence, and seeks to 
subjugate the region to its will, policy, and strategy. Its 
promotion of the idea of a Middle East market falls in this 
context. What shatters Israel's dreams is Syria's solid stance 
regarding its maneuvers and the Arab masses' determination to 
hold onto their rights and claims against Israel's schemes and 
procrastination. 
  [Al-Sa'id] How can Arab relations be developed in the face 
of 
the so-called new world order? 
  [Mashariqah] There is no new world order; there are 
international changes and developments that led to the 
disintegration of the Socialist bloc in Eastern Europe and the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and, consequently, the emergence of 
the unipolar trend in international relations. These changes 
have not reached their ultimate form and developments are 
continuing. Hence, we cannot talk of a developed new world 
order. 
  At any rate, developing Arab relations and enhancing Arab 
solidarity are for the good of the Arab nation. They will help 
it cope with international developments and defend its rights 
and existence by confronting threats. The same thing goes for 
relations with Islamic states.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The U.S. Administration is expected to 
resume its efforts in the Middle East early next week with a new 
tour by its chief diplomat, Warren Christopher, in order to 
clear the way for the resumption of the Washington bilateral 
negotiations. It is natural that the resumption of the 
negotiations should be linked with the degree of seriousness in 
Israel's answers to the basic questions Secretary of State 
Christopher carried from Damascus after he held detailed talks 
with President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  It is also natural that progress or stalemate in the peace 
process should be linked to real change in Israel's position. 
No one would disagree that the establishment of peace needs 
action rather than sweet talk on the importance of and the need 
for achieving that peace. The U.S. Administration has sensed 
Syria's true intentions, and President Bill Clinton has not 
concealed this. Moreover, he has reiterated on many occasions 
his belief in Syria's credible position and its serious trend 
toward peace. Christopher did the same during his tour of the 
region last week. 
  Syria's concern for pushing the peace process forward, 
however, does not at all mean any relinquishment of its 
constants or any bargaining over territory, rights, and 
sovereignty. These are matters that Syria will never reconsider 
under any circumstances. President Bill Clinton's 
administration, as well as Israel, knows this fact. 
  Total withdrawal from Golan is the basis for negotiations on 
the Syrian track. This occupied Syrian territory should return 
completely to the motherland, as it used to be before the June 
aggression of 1967. Syria's right to sovereignty over its 
territory is a fact that cannot, and will not be bypassed. What 
applies to Golan also applies to the occupied part of southern 
Lebanon and to Jordanian territories occupied by Israel. Hence, 
the importance of continued coordination among the Arab parties 
involved in the peace process. This coordination will be a 
guarantee for the Arabs and will constitute a weapon that will 
enable them to regain their usurped rights and their occupied 
territories and to avoid the Israeli trap of unilateral deals 
and partial settlements. 
  Experience has shown that such settlements will not achieve 
peace, but will undermine the chances of achieving a 
comprehensive and just peace. The best example is the 
disappointment of the Palestinians in the occupied Arab 
territories following the signing of the fragile self-rule 
accord, which will keep the Palestinian people subject to 
Israel's mercy and domination. 
  Syria is working to establish a comprehensive peace and 
durable peace that will not create disappointments. Such a 
peace cannot be achieved without the implementation of the 
relevant UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, which 
former President George Bush's administration proposed, and on 
which the Madrid conference was launched under the U.S. and 
Russian sponsorship, and to which current President Clinton's 
administration committed itself after pledging to play a fair 
and complete partner in the peace process. 
  Those who seek such a peace will find every cooperation from 
Syria. But if talk about peace is merely an Israeli maneuver, 
no new tour by Washington will achieve anything to save the 
peace process from the crisis in which the Israeli rulers have 
placed it. 
  Syria has repeatedly asserted that peace falls within the 
strategy it has adopted for many years. But the other side, 
Israel, has been talking about peace at a time when it places 
obstacles, mines, and thorns on the road. Today, we say that 
the opportunity to achieve peace is available if intentions are 
sincere and if statements turn into action on the ground. 
Otherwise, the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace 
will remain out of reach. This fact will be sensed by the head 
of U.S. diplomacy, Warren Christopher, when he returns to the 
Middle East. He should deal with facts and deeds to succeed in 
his new mission and so that the peace process can witness a real 
move toward its desired goal.

  [Text] New Delhi has categorically told Washington that 
bilateral trade disputes should be resolved at the multilateral 
level and not through unilateral actions. The commerce minister 
stated in the Rajya Sabha when members drew the attention of the 
house to the reported U.S. threat of invoking Special 301 
provision of its Trade Act. Replying to a question, Mr. Pranab 
Mukherji ruled out granting product patents with retrospective 
effect and said these can be considered only after the World 
Trade Organization agreement comes into force. He said the 
government intends to set up an expert group to suggest changes 
needed in the Indian Patents Act. He made it clear that all 
patents are to be granted under our own legislation and not 
under the provisions of the global agreement relating to Trade 
Related Intellectual Property Rights.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "US and Super 301"] </F>
  [Text] The Indian Government cannot be blamed if it 
despairs of pumping sense and sensitivity into the Clinton 
Administration. In keeping with the Superman syndrome by which 
it is possessed, the US is once again raring to upset the 
applecart by threatening India with imposition of sanctions 
under the Super 301 law for its alleged failure on a variety of 
counts which properly fall within the mandate of the World Trade 
Organisation (WTO). The US has thus cocked its snook at the 
nearly 120 plenipotentiaries who gathered at Marrakesh barely 8 
few weeks ago to issue a solemn Ministerial Declaration. The 
signatories were enjoined, with immediate effect and until the 
WTO came formally into being, not to take any unilateral trade 
measures or sanctions that would detract from the sanctity of 
the Final Act and start a bush fire of protectionism. The 
Clinton Administration has reportedly assured the US Congress in 
effect that, whatever the Final Act may permit or prohibit, the 
US will continue to have the cake and eat it as well by grabbing 
all the goodies of GATT and by imposing unilateral sanctions 
whenever it felt so disposed. 
  The US has backtracked to the extent of holding the Super 
301 
steps against India in abeyance for two months, hoping no doubt 
for applause for small mercies. Actually, the deferment is true 
to the pattern of `say (or do) now, think later' that is now 
governing the conduct of the US. Slowing down on Super 301 must 
have been the result of its suddenly dawning on US officials 
that the Indian Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, is slated 
to visit their country in mid May. Invoking Super 301 just a 
few weeks before his visit, ostensibly for friendly exchange of 
views with the US President, would have been, even for the US, 
an act of insufferable boorishness. But that does not, by any 
means, take away the sting. Mr. Rao will be left in no doubt, 
implied or otherwise of the Damocles' sword hung over his head, 
as a way of warning `or else'. The US has been making no 
allowances at all for the susceptibilities of others, whether it 
is China, Japan, North Korea or India, and insisting on having 
things its way. Like a spoilt child, it expects unquestioned 
submission to its dictates from the rest of the world. Thereby, 
it has been throwing to the four winds not just diplomatic 
niceties but the time-honoured, sacrosanct virtue of good 
neighbourliness marked by consideration and accommodation. One 
is really puzzled as to what to make of all this. Being left 
with no counterweight on the world balance after the collapse of 
the Soviet Union, does the US feel free to go on a rampage at 
will? Has some undiagnosed paranoia taken hold of some of the 
Administration functionaries, unversed in the art of 
international relations, and do they feel continually insecure 
without flexing their muscles? Whatever it is, what is being 
witnessed is the worst possible manifestation of the old chant: 
what is good for the General Motors is good for America and what 
is good for America is good for all the world! 
  So much the pity. For, the US is still the world's exemplar 
in the openness of its society and the lively, forthcoming and 
open nature of its people. Its instincts are generous as when it 
went all out for saving the world from Hitler or poured billions 
of dollars as part of the Marshall Plan. It has been foremost 
in rushing to the succour of nations in the grip of famine and 
starvation. It has given refuge to thousands fleeing from 
oppression and persecution. A country with such high credentials 
as a free society, as a democracy and as a friend of the world's 
needy and hungry has no reason at all to abandon grace and throw 
its weight about. 
  All that apart, the question of questions now is: With the 
US in no mood to make amends but, on the contrary, being prone 
to indulge in rude antics, should the Prime Minister visit the 
US as scheduled? Or should he call off the trip? How will he 
look if, without even waiting for his back to turn, the US 
clamps Super 301 or does something equally offensive? The US 
itself in the past thought nothing of blackballing the leaders 
of the countries for some real or fancied slight. When Lal 
Bahadur Shastri had the temerity to comment on American 
intervention in Vietnam some weeks before a planned official 
visit to the US, President Johnson called it off abruptly 
without any compunction. Mr. Rao will do well to think twice 
about the heavy price he and the country may have to pay just 
for the pleasure of a photo session with President Clinton.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Jordan, American, U.N. and Lloyds Register 
representatives are holding talks in New York on the modalities 
of a proposed land-based regime at al-'Aqabah to verify 
adherence to the international sanctions against Iraq, official 
and other sources said Saturday [7 May]. 
  Although Washington has accepted the Jordanian proposal that 
Lloyds Register take charge of the verifications, several key 
issues remain to be agreed upon before the arrangement could go 
into place at al-'Aqabah, according to the sources. 
  "For some reason or the other, the Americans are taking 
their 
own time even on issues that need very little clarification," 
said one source. "At this rate, it could be several weeks if 
not months before a final agreement is reached." 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced the 
American acceptance of the proposal, subject to "finetuning," 
after a meeting with His Majesty King Husayn in London on April 
25. 
  Prime Minister Abd al-Salam al-Majali said last week that 
the 
U.S.-led naval force patrolling the Red Sea had not intercepted 
and delayed any al-'Aqabah-bound vessel after the King's meeting 
with Mr. Christopher. 
  But, Dr. al-Majali said, this did not mean that the 
interceptions had stopped. He added that no progress had been 
made in having the onshore verifications regime in place at 
al-'Aqabah. 
  France announced last week that it was withdrawing from the 
so-called multinational interception force (MIF) in line with 
the Jordanian effort to end the damaging sea-based inspections 
of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels. 
  According to the source, the issues on the table in the 
ongoing discussions in New York involve the mechanism for Lloyds 
Register's presence at al-'Aqabah, modalities of ensuring 
adherence to the U.N. resolutions that imposed the international 
sanctions against Iraq and who will pay the cost for Lloyds 
Register presence at al-'Aqabah. (The sources could not confirm 
reports that Jordan might be seeking a Security Council 
announcement that the offshore inspections are being replaced 
with an onshore verification regime). 
  On the first point, Jordan has proposed that a Lloyds 
Register representative be included in a team along with port 
officials, clearning agents and shipping agents which will 
observe Jordanian customs inspection of all incoming and 
outgoing cargo related to Jordan, the source said. Such teams 
are a permanent fixture of all import and export procedures at 
the port in line with Jordanian customs regulations. 
  "The customs and the port authority are the two sides that 
never change," noted a shipping source, noting that other 
participants will be a representative of the clearing agent 
nominated by the importer and another nominated by the concerned 
shipping agents. 
  Under the proposal, Lloyds Register will join the customs 
and 
ports officials as standing members of the team until such time 
the situation in the international sanctions against Iraq is 
changed. 
  "This agreement will concern cargo coming into and going out 
of the Jordnian market," said the source. "Actually this is a 
concession that Jordan is making. There is no rule that says 
Jordan-bound cargo should be inspected or observed by anyone." 
  All Iraq-bound cargo in transit through Jordan will be 
stored 
at a separate warehouse, and will be cleared according to the 
guidelines set by the U.N. Sanctions Committee. 
  "All items other than food and medicine should have the 
approval of the Sanctions Committee," said the soruce. "Those 
that might arrive at the port will have to await such approval 
wherever that is necessary." 
  Sufian Muhaisan, manager of the Jordan Shipping Agents 
Association (JSAA), confirmed that this was the broad outline of 
the Jordanian proposal. 
  "Jordan is abiding by the sanctions against Iraq, and there 
is no reason why Jordanian imports or exports should be 
inspected or even observed," Mr. Muhaisan told the JORDAN TIMES. 
  "Lloyds Register can observe what is going on at the port 
and 
what kind of goods come into and go out of Jordan and file its 
reports," he said. "Nothing more, nothing less," he added 
without elaboration. 
  Another point in the New York discussions is payment for 
Lloyds Register for its observatory presence at al-'Aqabah. 
  The Sanctions Committee has refused to accept a Jordanian 
request that the United Nations pay the cost, the sources said. 
The request was made by Prime Minister al-Majali when he 
addressed the committee in New York in December. 
  Subsequently Jordan proposed that the Amman government pay 
the costs and reduce the amount from the Kingdom's annual 
contribution to the U.N., the sources said. it was not clear by 
Saturday whether the world body had accepted the proposal. 
Reports from London said the amount being discussed was between 
$2 million and $3 million per year. There was no confirmation 
of these reports.

<F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The United States has officially informed 
Jordan of its acceptance of the Kingdom's proposal to replace 
the sea-inspection of al-'Aqabah-bound shipping with land-based 
verifications of cargo by the independent British company Lloyds 
Register, informed sources said Monday. 
  The sources said the U.S. decision was communicated to the 
Kingdom Sunday in a letter sent by U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. American Embassy sources declined comment 
when asked about the letter. The sources said the U.S. decision 
would remove the obstacle to Jordan's resumption of its active 
role in the Arab-Israeli peace process and is a step towards 
restoring Jordanian-U.S. "normal and friendly relations." 
  The sources, which requested anonymity, said the siege on 
al-'Aqabah would be lifted after completing work on what they 
described as minor technicalities. That would be soon, they 
said. 
  They said the "fine-tuning" which Mr. Christopher referred 
to 
when he announced the acceptance of the Jordanian proposal in 
London on April 25 was almost over. Mr. Christopher said at a 
joint press conference with His Majesty King Husayn in London 
that the U.S. had accepted the Jordanian proposal to have Lloyds 
Register verify al-'Aqabah-bound cargo once it is unloaded in 
the port instead of the sea-inspections which the Kingdom says 
had caused enormous losses to its economy. 
  The American decision came a few days after France announced 
it was withdrawing from the international forces inspecting 
al-'Aqabah-bound shipping while enforcing the sanctions against 
Iraq. 
  Informed sources said that Canada had rejected an American 
offer to replace the French in light of Jordan's provision of an 
alternative to the sea-inspection. 
  The Lower House of Parliament Monday praised what it called 
the "belated" but "positive" French decision, expressing hope 
that other countries would follow suit, end the siege on the Red 
Sea port and compensate the Kingdom for the losses it has 
incurred from it. 
  "The (French decision) reflect's France's awareness of the 
correctness of Jordan's policies and the fairness of its 
demands." 
  Al-'Aqabah Deputy Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti said the U.S. 
decision to end the siege on al-'Aqabah is "a victory for the 
justness of the Jordanian demand over the logic of power which 
was exercised over it." 
  Mr. al-Kabariti said the lifting of the siege should be 
followed by more steps to improve the economic situation in the 
country because "a stable, moderate and strong Jordan will 
strengthen the cause of stability in the whole region." 
  Mr. al-Kabariti called on the United States to take concrete 
steps towards realising President Bill Clinton's promise to help 
write off some of Jordan's foreign debts, hoping the decision to 
end the sanctions would constitute a first step towards 
addressing the economic woes of the Kingdom, which, he said, has 
been in the forefront of forces for moderation in the region.

  [Text] The House of Representatives has commended the 
existing positive and distinguished relations between Jordan and 
France based on mutual understanding and respect. In a 
statement issued today, the House of Representatives said it was 
satisfied with the French Government's decision to stop its 
participation in naval inspections at the Port of al-'Aqabah. 
Following is the text of the House of Representatives' 
statement: 
  The Jordanian House of Representatives received with some 
satisfaction the statements by the French Foreign Ministry's 
spokesman on Wednesday, 4 May 1994, which deal with the French 
Government's decision to stop its participation in naval 
inspections at the Port of al-'Aqabah. 
  Although the House of Representatives believes that this 
step 
is somewhat late, it still considers it a positive step since it 
shows the French Government's understanding and awareness of 
Jordan's sound policies, just demands, and firm and principled 
stands. 
  Moreover, the House of Representatives hopes that the French 
Government's decision will be the first step, followed by 
similar steps by other countries participating in the naval 
inspections, toward lifting the siege imposed on the Port of 
al-'Aqabah and compensating Jordan for the serious losses it has 
suffered as a result of these inspections. 
  As the Jordanian House of Representatives is fully aware of 
the international changes and developments and of the fact that 
only one superpower is imposing its decisions and its own 
interpretation on others, and it hopes that the French 
Government will take another step by exerting more effort and 
playing a more effective role to implement the resolutions of 
international legitimacy in a just and unbiased manner. 
  At the same time, the Jordanian House of Representatives 
commended the existing positive and distinguished relations 
between Jordan and France based on mutual understanding and 
respect and the House called for the continuous development of 
these relations.

  [Text] Amman, PETRA--Jordan yesterday welcomed the French 
Government's decision to suspend its participation in the naval 
inspection operations in al-'Aqabah Port. 
  This came in a statement by the Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, 
minister of state for foreign affairs, in answer to a question 
by the Jordanian News Agency. He said this decision was 
announced in a statement by the French Foreign Ministry's 
spokesman on Wednesday [4 May] on France's decision to halt its 
participation in naval inspection operations in al-'Aqabah Port. 
  Al-Hasan said the decision reflects France's understanding 
of 
Jordan's positive and constructive role in the region and the 
fairness of its request to reconsider the mechanism for 
implementing the embargo, which inflicted major losses on the 
Jordanian economy. The decision, he said, also reflect France's 
compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy and 
its conviction that Jordan is fulfilling all of its commitments 
and responsibilities toward the implementation of these 
resolutions. 
  Al-Hasan also praised the distinguished relations that are 
based on understanding and mutual respect between Jordan and 
France and the ties of close friendship between His Majesty King 
Husayn and His Excellency President Francois Mitterrand.

  [Text] The House of Representatives has issued a statement 
on the situation in Yemen. In the statement, the House urged 
members of the Yemeni House of Representatives to play an 
effective role in maintaining the unity of Yemen. The statement 
also appealed to the Yemenis not to resort to the use of weapons 
and violence, to adhere to democratic policy, and to maintain 
the language of dialogue and negotiation. Following is the text 
of the statement: 
  With great concern and deep regret, the Jordanian House of 
Representatives is following the news from fraternal Yemen on 
the regrettable bloody events there, including the accompanying 
problems such as the thousands of victims and the destruction of 
many of the brother Yemenis' achievements, foremost of which is 
Yemeni unity, the nucleus of the Arab unionist plan. 
  Proceeding from Arab brotherhood and from a concern for what 
is good for the Arabs, as represented by Jordan's sponsorship of 
the signing of the accord document and efforts to implement the 
document's provisions and to achieve reconciliation, the 
Jordanian House of Representatives calls on brothers in 
fraternal Yemen to refrain from using weapons and violence, to 
adhere to democratic policies, to maintain the dialogue and 
negotiations, and to concentrate all efforts on achieving a 
comprehensive development. 
  Moreover, the House calls on the brother members of the 
Yemeni House of Representatives to play an effective and 
positive role to maintain the unity of Yemen and its people's 
achievements. At the same time, the Jordanian House of 
Representatives announces its denunciation and condemnation of 
any attempt by any party to deviate the Yemeni crisis from its 
national course.

<F P=106> [Reported by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The Lower House of Parliament Monday 
condemned "possible attempts by foreign groups" to fuel the 
civil war in Yemen in what was seen as an indirect reference to 
some Gulf countries that have been allegedly supplying arms and 
money to the parties to the conflict. 
  Urging Yemenis to exert all possible efforts to solve their 
conflict through dialogue, the House called on the Yemeni people 
to "give up arms and violence" in order to preserve their unity. 
  "The major victim of the war will be the Yemeni unity, which 
is the core of Arab unity," the House said in a statement. 
  Referring to Jordan's hosting of the signing ceremony of the 
Yemeni reconciliation accord in February, the House said its 
concern with the situation in Yemen stems from its belief in the 
necessity of maintaining all that is positive in the Arab World. 
  The conflict between the formerly north and south Yemens 
exploded into full fledged civil war last Thursday when troops 
loyal to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdullah Salih and Yemeni Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid attacked each other near the former 
border of the two Yemens. 
  The situation continued to deteriorate since then and the 
United Nations evacuated most of its non-essential staff from 
the Arab peninsula state. 
  Diplomats were Saturday quoted as saying that President 
Salih's troops have tightened the noose around Aden, the former 
capital of South Yemen, and were poised to break through the 
gates of the city. 
  President Salih seems determined to settle the conflict with 
his southern foes militarily amidst calls from Aden that it is 
willing to accept foreign mediation. 
  Mr. al-Bid on Sunday reportedly contacted His Majesty King 
Husayn saying he was ready for dialogue with President Salih. 
The King brought the two Yemeni leaders to Amman to sign the 
reconciliation accord in February, but said last month that 
Jordan was leaving a military commission charged with separating 
northern and southern Yemeni troops. 
  Indications that the civil war was instigated and supported 
by foreign countries also came from the Jordan Press Association 
which said the bloody events in Yemen "could open the door (to 
interfere in the conflict) for suspicious foreign sides that 
work against the interests of the (Arab) nation and and its 
aspiration for unity." The association said in a statement that 
the fighting in Yemen poses a threat to Arab national security. 
  AL-DUSTUR daily said in an editorial that the civil war in 
Yemen could be the making of countries that are trying to punish 
Yemen for its stands on regional development, in what was seen 
as a reference to Yemen's opposition to the foreign coalition 
that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991. The paper did not name 
these countries, but the reference was believed to be to some 
Arab Gulf countries.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime </F>
minister and minister of higher education, in Amman, by Shihatah 
Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo, from the "Dialogue From Afar" program; 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] How can the Yemeni crisis be contained? 
  [Al-Tall] It is truly regrettable to see the sons of the one 
homeland fighting one another. This must be solved by dialogue, 
which helps people reach full and final solutions to their 
problems. Taking up arms to resolve their problems is rejected, 
regretted, and unacceptable at the national Yemeni and pan-Arab 
levels. 
  Moreover, Jordan fully believes that Arab problems should be 
handled within the Arab family. Hence, Arab efforts should be 
consolidated as soon as possible to tackle the Yemeni issue to 
avoid any chance of intervention by non-Arab parties, which 
would further complicate the problem. Therefore, I appeal to 
our brother Yemenis to stop fighting at once and to return to 
dialogue to solve their problems. There is no problem in the 
world that cannot be solved through dialogue as long as the 
collective goal of all parties is the higher national Yemeni 
interest. 
  We appeal to Arab states to quickly make the necessary 
efforts to resolve the existing problem in Yemen as soon as 
possible. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] You hosted a meeting with Yemeni leaders in 
Amman to sign the Pledge and Accord Document. Are you prepared 
to invite these leaders to Jordan again to solve the problem? 
  [Al-Tall] Jordan spares no effort to help any Arab state 
solve its problems. However, I believe that Jordan has already 
done all it can. I believe that the problem has deteriorated so 
much that now a collective Arab effort is needed. I think that 
the Arab Republic of Egypt, the major state in the Arab world, 
can play a role in finding a solution. Jordan will spare no 
effort to cooperate with its big sister Egypt. All other Arab 
states must assist in this matter. They have to stop the 
infighting among brother Yemenis as soon as possible. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Egypt has proposed an urgent meeting of the 
Arab League to discuss the Yemeni developments. The League has 
responded and the permanent delegates will be meeting at the 
League headquarters today. Does Jordan have any specific 
proposals to submit to this meeting in coordination with Egypt 
to resolve the crisis? 
  [Al-Tall] Actually Jordan's previously announced proposals 
are clear and frank. Jordan has stated that the Yemeni brothers 
should solve their issues through dialogue and end their 
problems so that this predicament which has gripped fraternal 
Yemen for the past few months will disappear. 
  Of course the Arab League's meeting at the delegate level is 
a positive step in this regard, but I hope the meeting will be 
quickly followed by other meetings, coordination, and contacts 
at a higher level to resolve this problem as quickly as 
possible. The issue has regrettably developed regrettably to a 
serious point and there is fear, God forbid, that it might 
escalate and forces from outside the Arab region might intervene. 
  Jordan firmly believes Arab issues should be handled by the 
Arab nation itself without intervention by any force from 
outside the region. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Do we understand from your statement that you 
are demanding, for example, a summit meeting or at least one at 
the level of foreign ministers to resolve this issue? 
  [Al-Tall] When the Arab League meets at a higher level, it 
will mean there is interest in the issue. I believe that the 
issue is of a magnitude that requires a meeting at the highest 
level and as soon as possible. I believe that if the mediation 
efforts are concerted, Arab efforts are rallied, and leaders of 
all Arab countries agree on a certain decision on Yemen, the 
Yemeni brothers will respond. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] There is a proposal to send Arab forces to 
disengage the forces. If the measure is agreed upon do you 
believe it will contribute to resolving the crisis? 
  [Al-Tall] I believe that an Arab meeting at the highest 
level 
would discuss all alternatives. If such a proposal has been 
submitted, why shouldn't it be implemented? However, I believe 
there still are some options that might prompt the Yemeni 
brothers to end the fighting and resume a dialogue. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] What options? 
  [Al-Tall] A joint Arab effort, led by Egypt.

<F P=106> [By Nabil Ghzawi] </F>
  [Excerpt] Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi has 
ruled out the convocation of an Arab summit at present to end 
Arab differences and rearrange the Arab house. He said that 
convening such a summit now is difficult and that it will be 
held only when all outstanding issues among the Arab countries 
are settled. 
  In an interview with AL-DUSTUR at the end of his Jordan 
visit, Dr. Sidqi said Egypt welcomes reviving Arab solidarity 
among the fraternal Arab countries and unifiying efforts in this 
respect. He said his country supports the efforts the Arab 
League, in the person of its secretary general, has exerted to 
mend the rift among these fraternal countries. 
  On whether there are any new Egyptian moves to activate the 
peace process on the Arab-Israeli tracks following the 
successful signing of the Cairo agreement between the 
Palestinians and the Israelis, Dr. 'Atif Sidqi said Egypt 
continues to exert efforts because it seeks a comprehensive and 
just settlement for the cause. He said: What has been achieved 
on the Palestinian-Israeli track is a step on the road to a just 
and comprehensive settlement on all tracks. 
  On the efforts and contacts to contain the Yemeni crisis, 
Dr. 
Sidqi said he has been in contact with the Jordanian officials 
during his stay in Amman to contain this fighting. He said: 
The bleeding started while we were in Jordan. He added: We in 
Egypt carry out an important role through personal envoys of 
President Husni Mubarak to Yemen and to other important parties 
to settle this crisis. 
  Dr. 'Atif Sidqi said: In light of our general policy, our 
stand is that we do not like to see Arabs use weapons against 
other Arabs. That's why our stand in Egypt in such cases is to 
try to have the parties negotiate to bring their viewpoints 
closer together in a peaceful, objective, and constructive 
manner. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Insane Fighting in Yemen"] </F>
  [Text] The battles raging all over Yemen these days are 
unbelievable. Four years after unity between the north and 
south, matters between brothers have reached an apogee of 
violence and fighting unseen even in very fierce wars. 
  What recklessness and madness governs the minds of those who 
have the power to decide war in fraternal Yemen? What do they 
want for their country and united people? Are the brothers in 
Yemen going to reap anything but damage, ruin, death, and the 
destruction of everything that has been built? 
  All the mistakes, all the disputes, and all the so-called 
deviations and excesses do not in any way justify these violent 
forms of fighting and dispute. Who will benefit from the 
destruction of Aden or Sanaa airports? What does the bombing 
of the presidential palaces and vital installations in Sanaa and 
Aden mean? The only people who will benefit are the enemies of 
Yemen and the enemies of its people's unity and democratic 
march, which was supposed to proceed toward a new era, in which 
the Arab people of Yemen could build the foundations of their 
progress and harmonize with the spirit of the age. 
  Faced with these violent, bloody confrontations and the 
bitter fighting among the brothers, we in Jordan -- whose leader 
patronized the reconciliation meeting and the signing of the 
pledge and accord document -- are overwhelmed with sadness, 
pain, and outrage. We denounce what is going on in Yemen, 
regardless of the reasons and motives, and regardless of who 
resorted to violence first. We say: We denounce all the parties 
without exception, because now matter how big they may get, 
differences between two parties should not reach the point of 
shedding the blood of a young man or a child and the destruction 
of a house, a school, or a hospital. 
  As we today stand watching what is going on in the mountains 
and plains of that fraternal country, we can do nothing but urge 
the Yemeni leaders to resort to logic and spare the blood of 
their children. We urge them to preserve their country and 
their unity and prevent their country from becoming a new 
Somalia or a new Afghanistan, the two countries that symbolize 
destruction, chaos, and bloodbaths, where the hungry and 
homeless wait for aid convoys.

  [Text] Two Indian terrorists have been apprehended by 
Pakistani troops after they crossed the Line of Control in 
Nikyal subsector of Azad Kashmir on the night of 4th and 5th of 
this month. Over 18 kg of explosives along with accessories and 
two tubes of rocket launchers have also been recovered from the 
saboteurs. According to preliminary investigations, the 
terrorists -- Mohammad Yusuf, son of Sain Mohammad; and 
Mohammad, son of Raj Mohammad -- belong to village (Neka 
Panchgaran) of Indian-held Kashmir. During interrogation, it 
has transpired that the two saboteurs received training in 
handling of explosives at a Gurkha Rifle unit of the Indian 
Army. They were roped in by one RAW [Research and Analysis 
Wing] agent, Havaldar [petty military officer] Sharma, through 
coercion. They were also promised that handsome amount will be 
paid to them on return with a warning that if they refused to 
carry out the orders, they would be shot dead and declared 
intruders. 
  Prior to the agents' entry into Nikyal subsector of Kotli, 
the Indian troops deployed near the Line of Control started 
heavy firing on the flanks first to divert the attention of the 
Pakistani troops, and also intimidate local population so that 
the terrorists could enter undetected. But this commonly used 
tactic of Indians aroused suspicion and Pakistani troops became 
extra vigilant. As the two terrorists penetrated into Azad 
Kashmir area, they were nabbed by a local patrol. Both the 
agents have confessed that they have been visiting various 
places in Azad Kashmir and Pakistan in the past for the purpose 
of sabotage. The terrorists have also confessed that a large 
number of educated Kashmiri youth are being imparted terrorism 
training by Indian soldiers under threat of maltreatment.
