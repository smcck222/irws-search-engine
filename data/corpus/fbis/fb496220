<F P=106> [Editorial: "China's Protest to the United States"] </F>
  [Text] The People's Republic of China has strongly 
protested to the United States against the adoption of a 
legislation concerning Taiwan and Tibet. The Chinese vice 
foreign minister summoned the U.S. ambassador in Beijing and 
made it clear to him that the United States has interfered in 
China's internal affairs by approving that law. Meanwhile, 
speaking at the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee's session, the 
architect of the Pressler Amendment, Senator Larry Pressler, 
accused China of developing nuclear missiles capable of striking 
the United States, which can create security concerns among 
neighboring countries. 
  The question is: Has Senator Larry Pressler taken onto his 
shoulder the onus of creating causes of friction in Pakistan's 
and China's relations with the developed nations? One can ask 
this because his every statement seems to be directed toward 
protecting the interests of India or Israel. Under these 
circumstances, if one were to say that Larry Pressler and 
Stephen Solarz are political cognates, then it would not be 
inappropriate. In his aforementioned statement, without naming 
India, Larry Pressler tried to bring home the point that Chinese 
missiles with the capacity to strike the United States could 
pose a threat to India's security. It seems India is fast 
increasing its lobbying in the U.S. political and legislative 
institutions to purchase Patriot missiles and technology from 
that country. 
  As for Taiwan and Tibet, Pakistan recognizes these two 
regions as parts of China. However, India and the United States 
are gradually carrying forward their policies under a well 
thought-out plan to create an uprising against Beijing in Tibet 
and make Taiwan refuse to come under the sway of Beijing's 
administration. The United States, after having deferred the 
Tibet issue to India, is now playing the role of a silent 
spectator and is keeping the Taiwan issue directly in its own 
hands. If all these things are analyzed, then it will become 
crystal clear in the very first stage that the conspiracies to 
blockade China from all sides are being executed very cunningly. 
The recent U.S. approval of a legislation about Tibet and 
Taiwan also points to the Indo-U.S. conspiracy against China. 
  The seminars currently being organized in Pakistan to pave 
the way for the implementation of the U.S. plan to divide the 
state of Jammu and Kashmir also seem to be a link in the chain 
of this conspiracy. The people of Pakistan openly support the 
protestations made by the Chinese vice foreign minister against 
the U.S. law and demand that Washington stop its increasing acts 
of interference in the Asian region, because it is essential for 
the preservation of global peace.

  [Text] Rawalpindi (PPI) -- North Korea supports Pakistan's 
peaceful nuclear programme, said the North Korean Ambassador to 
Pakistan Mr Choe Su-il. 
  He was informally talking to the PPI after a function held 
in 
connection with annual prize distribution ceremony of Little 
Angels School, which co-incided with the 17th foundation day of 
the institution. 
  He said the perceptions of Pakistan and Korea on the nuclear 
issue were identical as Pakistan had an expressed desire for a 
nuclear free South Asia, while Korea wanted nuclear free Korean 
peninsula. 
  Asked would it be justified to pressurize Pakistan on 
unilaterally signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) 
he said "it is upto the Government of Pakistan to make a 
decision in this regard". 
  The Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Korea (DPRK) 
earlier in his address said Pakistan and Korea enjoyed excellent 
traditional relations adding that the ties of friendship had 
further been cemented by the visit of Pakistan's delegation 
headed by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to Korea. "We highly 
value the friendship with Pakistan and will do our best too 
further promote the ties", Choe Su-il maintained. 
  Underlining the importance of education he said it played 
key 
role for the nations to achieve the target of progress and 
prosperity. 
  The Principal of the school Mrs Salma Siddiqui presented a 
momento from all the `angels' and staff of the school to the 
chief guest. 
  The DPRK Ambassador presented a traditional Korean painting 
to Mrs Siddiqui and donated some books for the school library. 
  Students of the school, wearing colourful dresses, presented 
interesting tableaus and sung amusing songs on the occasion. 
They also presented plays to entertain the participants of the 
function. The chief guest distributed prizes among the students 
who showed remarkable performance in curricular and 
co-curricular activities during the year.

<F P=106> [Report by Amir Hay] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israel has notified the PLO that it will not 
permit the entry of some of the Badr brigade troops, due to 
deploy in Jericho, until it receives the names of the autonomy 
council members. 
  Meanwhile, Israel this afternoon barred seven deportees, who 
returned from Jordan, from entering through the Allenby Bridge. 
Only the father of the seven men was permitted to return to his 
village -- al-Rummanah in the Janin District. Our correspondent 
in the territories Amir Hay reports: 
  [Begin Hay recording] [passage omitted] Some 300 members of 
the Badr brigade today arrived at the other side of the border, 
on their way to Jericho. Israel, however, announced today that 
they will be denied entry as long as it did not receive an 
autonomy council name list. [passage omitted] 
  In Hebron, the TIPH [Temporary International Presence in 
Hebron] members assumed their duties today. They patrolled 
Hebron and launched a telephone inquiry center for local 
residents. In the course of their patrols, they stumbled into 
violent clashes between locals and IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
troops. Four TIPH vehicles were damaged in stone throwing 
incidents. The riots had been organized by Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad activists. [end

  [Text] Transportation Minister Yisra'el Qeysar has stated 
that no arms will be allowed aboard the six planes to be used by 
the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The head of the 
Civil Aviation Administration made it clear that the security 
arrangements in the two airstrips in Gaza and Jericho will be 
similar to security arrangements in the Rafah and Allenby Bridge 
border terminals. The Palestinians will be allowed to use two 
helicopters and four light planes, including Yasir 'Arafat's 
plane, which will serve him in his flights between Gaza and 
Jericho. All the Palestinian aerial activity will be conducted 
under the supervision of the Israel Civil Aviation 
Administration, and the pilots will have to undergo a special 
test by this body. 
  Minister Qeysar, who toured the Jordan Valley settlements 
and 
the Bet She'an Valley region today, also said that the 
construction of the Jericho bypass road will cost approximately 
200 million shekels. Minister Qeysar added that his office has 
already prepared detailed plans and maps toward the resumption 
of the land and sea link between Israel and Jordan after a peace 
agreement is signed between the two countries. He noted that 
Israel is interested in supplying Jordan with transport and 
commerce services via the ports of Haifa and Ashdod.

  [Text] Major General Dani Rothschild, coordinator of 
government activities in the territories, believes the power 
struggle between the local leaders in the territories and the 
PLO-Tunis leadership will continue. In his opinion, the PLO 
will find operating the self-rule difficult unless it assigns 
the local leaders a greater role. The local leaders, he says, 
will continue supporting the peace process in any event and will 
not join the anti-'Arafat organizations. 
  Speaking to our correspondent, Gen. Rothschild said the 
Palestinians began by demanding that Israel leave them to manage 
their affairs on their own, but they soon realized that the task 
was very complex. 
  The true test of the agreement's implementation, in the 
coordinator's opinion, will be the extent of the population's 
satisfaction and the rate of improvement in every sphere of 
life. Unless such improvement is attained, the strength of Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] and the other opposition forces 
will rise. 
  As for the next phase of the Cairo agreements, Gen. 
Rothschild does not anticipate easy negotiations on the early 
Palestinian empowerment in the rest of Judaea and Samaria. The 
matter is complicated, because we will be discussing joint 
Israeli-Palestinian bodies, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben and Washington </F>
correspondent 'Aqiva Eldar] 
  [Excerpts] Israel does not view U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's shuttle mission as a substitute for direct 
talks with Syria, either in the framework of the Washington 
talks or at a higher level, senior political sources stated 
yesterday. According to these sources, Israel regards the U.S. 
mediation as an auxiliary element of the negotiations aimed at 
settling matters of principle, but believes the details must be 
discussed directly by the sides. [passage omitted] 
  The senior political sources said that the gap between the 
Israeli and Syrian positions is very big and that detailed 
deliberations in working groups can only start after a framework 
for the negotiations has been determined. [passage omitted] 
  'Aqiva Eldar reports: The United States neither supports nor 
rejects the Israeli plan for an arrangement with Syria. Israeli 
and U.S. officials in Washington asserted yesterday that 
Secretary Christopher relayed the Israeli proposal to Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad without adopting a position on it. 
Referring to the banner headline in HA'ARETZ yesterday ("The 
United States Has Reservations About the Israeli Proposal"), 
Israeli sources said they had been told by senior State 
Department officials that Christopher had neither rejected nor 
criticized the Israeli proposals.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dan Margalit: "Unconvincing Ability"] </F>
  [Text] The media thoroughly analyzed Yasir 'Arafat's body 
language when he refused to sign the maps appended to the Gaza- 
Jericho agreement. The whole world saw it. Nevertheless, 
diplomats were more interested in Warren Christopher's bland 
reaction. Nobody was surprised. In certain respects, the 
status of the U.S. representative at the Cairo ceremony was 
similar to that of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
Both their contributions to the agreement signed by Israel and 
the PLO were paltry. 
  Nobody in official Jerusalem is saying a word on the issue. 
On the contrary, Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres lavished 
praise on Christopher's objectivity. The man with the Indian 
features is considered one of the fairest statesmen Israel has 
had contact with since the Six-Day War. Beyond his personal 
attributes, however, how beneficial can he be in the Middle East 
arena? 
  There has been no dearth of U.S. blunders in the 27 years 
since Israel took over the territories in a defensive war and 
declared its willingness to return to the international border 
in the Sinai and the Golan taking its security needs into 
account. Nevertheless, William Quandt's 460-page book "The 
Peace Process" shows that the Israeli-Arab conflict constantly 
featured in U.S. foreign policy. 
  To wit, Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger saw to linking the 
Israeli-Arab conflict to the world's oil reserves, the Vietnam 
war, the detente with the USSR and the openness toward China, 
and what not. Jimmy Carter was almost obsessive in his efforts 
to bring about peace between Israel and Egypt in Camp David, 
although he was not the one who initiated the move. How many 
lines will be devoted to Christopher's actions on behalf of Bill 
Clinton? 
  There were years when Israel wished U.S. diplomacy would 
butt 
out, but that old pattern has long vanished. Assuming that 
1994's Israel is interested in an active and spirited political 
process, the U.S. level of performance is disappointing to 
Jerusalem. After all, behind the smoke screen of flattery, 
Israeli experts gained the impression that Christopher did not 
fully grasp Hafiz al-Asad's sly intentions; that the Syrian 
president took the U.S. secretary for a ride; that he is 
actually unfit to steer the process upon his return to the 
region next week for a shuttle trip between Jerusalem and 
Damascus. What he brought back from his previous meeting with 
al-Asad aroused serious suspicions that he is unable to fully 
grasp the Syrians' true intentions, which the world must glean 
from hints and by reading between the lines. 
  Israel's unofficial disappointment with the U.S. ability to 
perform the Herculean task the Israeli-Syrian contacts will 
entail is not detached from the overall Clinton Administration's 
foreign policy. After the retreat in Somalia, the disgrace in 
Haiti, the capitulation in North Korea, and the fears in Bosnia, 
U.S. allies around the world are having a hard time trusting its 
diplomatic mettle. Al-Asad, who is not thrilled about peace 
with Israel anyway and merely wants to have Syria struck from 
the list of terror-supporting states, does not really care that 
such doubts come up. 
  Now, on the eve of the negotiations with Syria, Israel is 
clearly interested to monitor the actions of the U.S. diplomats 
who will be sent to the Middle East to carry out what they did 
with partial success in other areas around the globe. From 
Margaret Thatcher, America's loyal ally, going through the 
liberal commentator Anthony Lewis and the conservative Charles 
Krauthammer, the disappointment is sweeping and absolute. 
Thatcher has already warned Clinton about the conclusions his 
allies will draw from his failure in Bosnia. Such an event does 
not go without leaving an imprint. Also, using the United 
Nations as an alibi for the failures is pathetic. Krauthammer 
wrote in TIME magazine that when it comes to foreign policy 
Clinton must think as a President and not make decisions based 
on an analysis of UN Security Council resolutions. 
  Israel has some experience of its own. Eytan Bentzur, the 
Foreign Ministry's assistant director general, sought to forge a 
link with North Korea which had been developing long-range 
missiles and avoiding international supervision of its nuclear 
facilities. The State Department dissuaded Israel from speaking 
on its own to North Korea, which had been developing a dangerous 
arms trade with Iran. The United States promised Israel to take 
action on the issue. How much weight does such a commitment 
carry in view of the recurring signs that Washington is not 
entirely averse to including Pyongyang in the nuclear club? 
  In the context of the Middle East, Washington promised not 
to 
have a repeat performance of the Madrid conference under joint 
U.S.- Russian auspices. Although it trusts Clinton's goodwill, 
Jerusalem cannot trust his ability to stick to his guns. This 
is only the beginning. Furthermore, although America's status 
in the international arena is an indisputable fact -- even at a 
time when the man sitting in the White House is a President who 
is mostly engrossed in domestic policies -- Christopher and his 
entourage must still earn a solid position vis-a-vis al-Asad to 
enable Rabin to deal with Syria through them. Can they do that? 
On the eve of the resumption of the talks on the 
Jerusalem-Damascus track, one cannot avoid hearing the whisper 
of doubts.

<F P=106> [Report by Rami Shani] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres yesterday reiterated 
the government's commitment to safeguarding the security of the 
Qatif Bloc Jewish settlers, even though they are a very small 
group. The minister disclosed that the cost of the initial 
security arrangements will stand at approximately 30 million 
shekels, in addition to an annual outlay of 20 million shekels. 
As an example, he cited the need to build a security system, 
including a 7-km road to one of the settlements. "We are doing 
it to keep the agreement from collapsing," the minister noted. 
"The opponents of the agreement with the PLO are trying to 
scare and unnerve the residents of areas through which Arabs 
will drive," Peres said at a ceremony to mark the laying of the 
cornerstone for a new 'Amal technological college near Ashqelon. 
"It all depends on relationships, not security," the minister 
stressed. "There is no fence between Elat and al-'Aqabah, and 
relations there are excellent. Arabs live in Yafo, too. A new 
relationship must be created." 
  Peres denied rumors spread two days ago that Israel is not 
going to continue the talks with the PLO on the issues that 
remained unresolved when the Cairo agreement was signed. 
"Israel will adhere to its commitments," Peres stressed. With 
regard to foreign labor hired by Qatif farmers, the minister 
said it is preferable to employ Israeli laborers in agriculture.

people, the Knesset resolution affirms. The resolution was 
initiated by Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu, and Prime

  [Text] The attorney general says the refusal of IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] soldiers to carry out any order to evacuate 
Jewish settlements in the territories would be an act of 
disobedience bordering on rebellion. In an address to the 
Editors Committee, Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir said: A soldier can 
disobey an order only if it is patently illegal. He said the 
issue of withdrawal from settlements was in dispute among 
jurists and, therefore, soldiers were duty-bound to obey such an 
order since it was not indisputably illegal.

  [Text] Israel and Morocco are currently holding contacts 
in a bid to establish diplomatic ties. Prime Minister Rabin may 
travel to Morocco in the next two weeks. Our political 
correspondent Udi Segal has the details: 
  Over the last few days contacts have been held between 
Israeli and Moroccan officials in a bid to open an 
Israeli-Moroccan liaison office in Morocco as a first stage 
toward the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries. IDF Radio has learned that Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin may travel to Morocco in the next two weeks in an attempt 
to facilitate these contacts. A senior political source said, 
at the same time, that so far the attempt to open the liaison 
office has not succeeded. 
  Prime Minister Rabin landed in Morocco for the first time on 
his way back from the Declaration of Principles [DOP] signing 
ceremony in Washington last September. At that time Rabin met 
the king of Morocco, and since then there has been a lot of talk 
about the establishment of relations between the two countries. 
So far, however, the Moroccans have prevented this. Since the 
DOP signing ceremony there have been ongoing contacts between 
Israel and Morocco, especially in the economic-business sphere. 
There was also talk about the possibility of a direct air link 
between Morocco and Israel. It is possible that Prime Minister 
Rabin intends to inaugurate such a link in the next few weeks, 
when he flies from Israel to Moroccan capital Rabat.

  [Text] Israel and Morocco are holding contacts over the 
possibility of establishing mutual bureaus of interests. This 
was reported by our political correspondent Shlomo Raz. The 
prime minister's office denies that Yitzhaq Rabin plans to 
travel to Morocco. The prime minister and the foreign minister 
had planned to leave for Morocco immediately after the signing 
of the Israeli- Palestinian agreement in Cairo on 4 May, but the 
visit was canceled at the last moment. It now appears that only 
Mr. Peres will visit Morocco.

<F P=106> [Article by Nehama Dowek: "Who Will Occupy Ramon's Chair?"] </F>
  [Text] Even before the Labor party has had sufficient time 
to recover from the divorce papers sent by Ramon, the boat is 
being rocked by a new storm, which is another ramification of 
the original move. Hayim Ramon's move did more than threaten 
the Labor's hegemony in the Histadrut; it left a vacant space at 
the top, a space that has to be filled, a space that causes 
great apprehension in the party. All triggers have been 
released, and some people are standing with live grenades in 
hand, waiting for the next move before deciding where they 
should be hurled. 
  As cabinet member, Ramon represented the party young 
generation's hunger for privileges and for a role in the making 
of momentous decisions. Ramon, who was 42 when he was first 
appointed minister, was the white hope of the young guard, for 
whom he was a model to be emulated. Now his place at the big 
table is vacant. The young party members are convinced that one 
of them should occupy it. The middle generation members believe 
it is time one of theirs joined the leading team. And Rabin? 
Apparently he has made no commitment to anyone. He listens to 
everyone, nods his head, and does whatever he pleases. 
  The prime minister's bureau has been a scene of pilgrimage 
in 
the past two weeks. 'Uzi Bar'am, Nisim Zvili, Avrum [Avraham] 
Burg, and Hagay Merom all met with him at their request. The 
list may have been longer. They all spoke of the need to 
appoint a young Labor minister. Rumor has it that Zvili 
actually prodded Rabin. Failure to appoint a member of the young 
guard at once would be a mistake, he said. With Zvili as the 
initiator, the move needs to be thoroughly examined. Seasoned 
politicians explain that such a move will create facts on the 
ground, barring Ramon from returning to the government after the 
Histadrut [Labor Federation] elections. The occupied seat will 
signal to Ramon something along the lines of the famous adage 
that "graveyards are filled with people who thought they were 
indispensable...." 
  Rabin listened and nodded. The conversation, we are told, 
proceeded as follows: 
  Zvili: "If you are asking me, you should act quickly and get 
someone from the Ramon bunch into the government." 
  Rabin: "Who?" Zvili: "There is no shortage of candidates: 
Beilin, Burg, Merom. You have two vacant seats." Rabin: "Is 
that your suggestion?" Zvili: "Yes, it is." 
  Bar'am had a similar suggestion. Rabin remained uncommitted. 
In any event, he said, it is irrelevant until after the 
Histadrut elections. 
  Burg and Merom apparently asked to be placed at the 
forefront 
of the group vying for the vacated slot. Burg, who is working 
around the clock for the Histadrut election campaign in 
Jerusalem -- he heads their public relations -- this week 
released a statement to the press proposing to stay off the 
issue, because this is not the right time. However, at the end 
of the statement he mentions -- supposedly by the way -- that 
when they do get to discussing the issue, they should remember 
the results of the primaries. Explanation for the uninitiated: 
In the primaries, Avrum Burg made the third slot, right after 
Rabin and Peres. When Rabin was composing his cabinet, Burg 
considered himself a natural candidate for ministerial 
appointment. Rabin had a different opinion. Burg should mellow 
a bit, grow up a bit, he said. Burg, a Peres man who has never 
received real promotion from him, was offended, but continued 
running. Now he thinks it is time the IOU was paid. 
  Burg will be impeded by his recent announcement that he was 
competing for the job of the Jewish Agency chairman. He made 
frequent statements about how important and interesting the job 
was. Now he says: "Being a minister is still more interesting 
in these critical times. If I have to choose between the two, I 
would prefer to be minister. Yes, I believe the primaries 
results are consequential. If they decide to appoint Edri, they 
will find me there [not further specified]." 
  The key of coalition appointments stipulates one minister 
per 
three Knesset members [MK's]. The faction had 44 MK's and rated 
15 ministers. Now, after Ramon's "secession," it rates only 14 
ministers. But even now, it is two ministers short. Rabin 
still holds five portfolios: prime minister, defense, interior, 
religious affairs, and health. He is reserving the religious 
affairs and interior for SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim]. 
Defense is run by him and by Mordekhay Gur. That leaves him 
with the health portfolio, although another appointment is 
possible, particularly in view of the fact that some ministers 
have two portfolios. There is an opinion that since Rabin does 
not feel obligated to anyone, he may appoint an outside 
professional, thereby closing the affair. 
  If he does that, there will be backlash from party members. 
Justifiably, they are looking for appointments. Five MK's feel 
they deserve it, some more, some less: Yosi Beilin, Avrum Burg, 
Hagay Merom, Rafi Edri, and Efrayim Sne. 
  Beilin, the deputy foreign minister who has been doing an 
excellent job, does not like being presented as a candidate. He 
is happy, and he is not even certain that Peres will fight for 
him now, in view of the recent tension between them. On the 
other hand, he will not decline a ministerial appointment, if 
offered one. Even if it is the health portfolio. His 
appointment will depend on Peres. Rumors have it that Rabin does 
not like him, but he thinks very highly of him and is not ruling 
out his candidacy altogether. "No one has told me anything, and 
I do not think it is relevant at the moment," Beilin says. 
  Peres' position on the case of Burg is equally unclear. 
Peres is today a solitary cabinet minister, the sole member of 
his own camp, after Shahal, whose appointment Peres had warmly 
encouraged, has long ago wandered off in the direction of Rabin. 
As for Burg, it is being said that Peres had provided him with 
a springboard, but the moment his back was turned, Peres 
snatched away the pool. 
  Hagay Merom, a member of Kibbutz Yif'at which belongs to the 
United Kibbutzim Movement [UKM], once fought for a ministerial 
appointment, but Rabin preferred Tzur, although the latter had 
not been elected to the Knesset. Merom was offended, and a 
short while later, he attacked Rabin from the Knesset podium, 
calling on him to restrain the functionaries at the Prime 
Minister's Office. The prevailing opinion is that Rabin does 
not trust him, and in addition, he has no reason to appoint 
another UKM member. 
  Merom: "I do not take the various statements about me 
seriously, and I have no claims on a place around the cabinet 
table. I like it in the Knesset, and I like it in a situation 
where I am free to voice my views -- even when they are against 
the government -- without the constraints of ministerial 
responsibility. But, I appreciate my colleagues' thinking I 
should be minister." 
  Efrayim Sne, too, was once a Peres man. However, he quit 
at the last minute of the struggle between Peres and Rabin. I 
think Rabin is more suitable, he said then. Peres does neither 
forgive nor forget. Whenever Sne's name is mentioned for a 
possible government position -- and it has been mentioned for a 
variety of jobs -- Peres vetoes it. Perhaps this time Rabin 
will persist. Sne's training as a doctor could be to his credit 
when the candidate for the job of health minister is considered. 
Speculations are that given the choice between Beilin, Burg, 
Merom, and Sne Rabin will choose the latter. Incidentally, Sne 
met Peres last week and asked him to withdraw his opposition to 
his inclusion in the government, either as a deputy minister or 
as a minister. Peres replied: "Why should you be appointed 
before Beilin or Burg?" Peres had a similar reply about Rafi 
Edri's candidacy. 
  Edri, a minister without portfolio in the unity government, 
walks around with a promise in his pocket from Rabin to appoint 
him as a minister. The promise was given to him before Ramon 
dropped his bombshell, when Edri finessed the resumption of 
relations with SHAS. Rabin had then planned to ask the Labor 
Central Committee to approve the return to the government of 
Ramon -- who resigned due to the party convention's resolutions 
-- along with the appointment of Edri as minister without 
portfolio. The double deal was meant to soften the blow for 
those who feel that the younger generation is not sufficiently 
represented. 
  Now, everything has changed. Rabin may not be able to make 
good on his promise to Edri, which some term "a solid promise 
that holds more than water." The problem could be solved if the 
prime minister had the guts to make the move he ought to make: 
"rid" the government of David Liba'i and Shim'on Shetrit, two 
law professors who get on his nerves. Then he would have three 
or four vacancies, which would enable him to appoint a few young 
men as ministers and be seen as a leader grooming Labor's next 
generation, as Begin and Shamir did in the Likud. However, 
Rabin is not built that way. He would rather leave people in 
the lurch and make them leave of their own volition. The point 
is, however, that Liba'i and Shetrit have no plans to go. 
  Under certain circumstances one might consider the 
possibility of Ramon himself returning to the government. 
However, such a scenario may only be examined after the 
Histadrut elections, and only if Ramon fails to head the largest 
faction. According to one scenario, under such conditions Ramon 
would transfer his votes to Labor in exchange for a seat around 
the government able. This will create a problem. Ramon was 
expelled from Labor, and if he is appointed minister he will no 
longer be able to run in the Knesset elections. People will say 
he already got his reward. On this point, Labor is holding him 
by the throat. Ramon's friends claim that he will return to 
Labor only through the front door; that is, if he wins the 
Histadrut elections and is appointed its secretary general. 
Then, however, Ramon will stay as secretary general and there 
will be a vacant seat around the government table. 
  Zvili: "The issue is not on the agenda. Everything will be 
dealt with after the Histadrut elections and SHAS' return to the 
coalition. I did not make any recommendations to the prime 
minister as to whom he should appoint. That is his call. I 
told him that as soon as he makes up his mind I will help him 
get his decision approved by all the party institutions." 
  Meanwhile, the expected appointments have become the hottest 
topic of conversation in the Knesset cafeteria. Everybody is 
stirring the pot, appointing, and making doomsday predictions. 
And what about Rabin? He is tensely awaiting the results of 
the Histadrut elections. He has put all the ingredients in the 
pot, and it remains to be seen whether Ramon will spoil his 
broth.

  [Excerpts] A squadron of four Israeli warplanes twice 
raided the positions of the Ahmad Jibril-led Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in the al-Na'imah 
Hills and al-Damur at 1205 and 1210 today. The warplanes fired 
10 delayed action missiles. Following the raids, the enemy 
warplanes broke the sound barrier over Beirut and flew at very 
low altitude over the south. Today's Israeli raids are the 
ninth since the beginning of the year. 
  A military source stated this afternoon that the Israeli 
enemy launched several raids against the al-Na'imah hills. The 
raids are continuing, the source added. Army units nearby are 
confronting the raiding warplanes using available weapons. 
Sources close to the Internal Security Forces have stated that 
the enemy warplanes used the sea route to reach their targets. 
The same sources added that an as yet unspecified number of 
people have been hurt. The Internal Security Forces have asked 
ambulances and Civil Defense teams to head for the area hit by 
the raid to evacuate the wounded to the hospitals. [passage 
omitted] 
  We have just received a report that the Israeli raids 
against 
the al-Na'imah hills resumed at 1315 this afternoon. The 
Israeli warplanes are launching a raid every 10 minutes. Three 
Palestinians have been wounded as a result. Since 1320, Israeli 
warplanes have been flying over Sidon and the Palestinian camps 
at medium altitude.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Observance of International Conventions Should </F>
Be Mutual"] 
  [Text] The British government has accused the Islamic 
Republic of establishing contact with and of helping the Irish 
Republican Army. The Iranian Charge d'Affaires in London, 
Gholamreza Ansari was called to the Foreign Office and handed a 
protest note by British officials. The Islamic Republic has 
denied the British allegation. 
  Regardless of London's objection and Iran's denial, and 
considering the fact that influential Irish-Americans are the 
main suppliers of arms and money to the IRA, the question which 
begs for an answer is whether or not Britain or any other 
Western country has the right to question Iran's actions 
regarding adherence to internationally accepted conventions? 
  From the Iranian point of view, Western countries have 
repeatedly ignored the spirit of international conventions which 
regulate relations between individual countries. The 1961 and 
1963 Vienna Conventions requiring the observance of mutual 
diplomatic rules among nations and emphasizing the reciprocity 
of action regarding Consular staff and activities, have been 
openly ignored by the West through their overt and covert 
support for Iranian terrorist groups residing in their countries. 
  Western powers, Britain among them, can not plead ignorance 
when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian groups 
they harbor in the West, because all they have to do is to 
instruct their embassies in Tehran to monitor anti-Iranian 
radios who teach their elements inside the Islamic Republic how 
to manufacture home-made bombs and slaughter innocent Iranian 
citizens. 
  The government of the Islamic Republic has been under 
increasing domestic public opinion pressure which questions the 
wisdom of Iran's policy of not allowing Bader-Meinhof, Direct 
Action, or the IRA to have offices in Tehran, while anti-Iranian 
terrorist groups enjoy almost full diplomatic rights in Bonn, 
Paris, and London. The Iranian public is consistently 
questioning the government why it adheres to international 
conventions regarding aiding and abetting terrorists when 
Western countries so openly and flagrantly ignore the same 
conventions. 
  The damage, both in human and monetary terms, caused by 
anti-Iranian terrorist groups harbored, financed, and armed by 
Western countries, are huge compared to those caused by the 
three above-mentioned Western terrorist organizations. This 
latest baseless British protest over the Iran-IRA contact is but 
a smoke-screen to hide the fact that Western-based anti-Iranian 
terrorists are providing materiel and personnel to the 
Iraqi-based terrorists to attack targets inside the Islamic 
Republic. The British protests are also meant to cover up the 
fact that Western intelligence sources are encouraging these 
same anti-Iranian terrorists.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Hoseyn Sheykholeslam, deputy foreign </F>
minister in charge of African-Arab Affairs, by unidentified 
correspondent -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr. 
Sheykholeslam, we know the administrative agreement for the 
Gaza-Jericho plan was signed in Cairo yesterday. What was the 
PLO's and Tel Aviv's aim in signing this agreement? 
  [Sheykholeslam] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful, greetings to dear viewers. As you might know, the 
issue of Gaza and its transfer to Egypt has been under review 
for some time in Israeli circles. As reported in the press, the 
management of this part of Palestine had become a serious 
problem for the Israelis due to an intense and extensive 
revolutionary movement, or what we know today as intifadah. 
Intifadah consists of methods that we had in our own 
revolution; that is, people coming into the streets with bare 
hands and there taking whatever they can. Everyone--small 
children and old men--wanted the Israelis to leave them alone 
and to get out of their country. One faction in Israel believed 
that they should let go of the area and get out no matter what. 
  Mr. Rabin, Mr. Peres, and other statesmen believed that they 
should save something from the spoiled oil, and Mr. 'Arafat was 
after getting whatever they would give him at any cost. So they 
reached this agreement. In reality, Israelis aim to control 
intifadah through the Palestinians themselves. Unfortunately, 
Mr. 'Arafat has a poor record in the war between Palestinians. 
On various occasions, he has suppressed Palestinians for 
political and personal interests--including in Lebanon, where we 
were a witness. 
  The main danger facing the situation is that, God forbid, 
Palestinian police trained by Britain and other western 
countries should stand face to face against the Palestinian 
nation and take the place of the Israeli police, which is 
presently the main instrument of suppression, and that the war 
becomes one among Palestinians. This has to be avoided whatever 
way possible. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Sheykholeslam, you spoke about the 
intifadah before. What is the reason for the intifadah to 
oppose the accord? 
  [Sheykholeslam] As you know, Jericho and Gaza is a very 
small 
part of the land of Palestine. The greater part of the land of 
Palestine has remained in the possession of the Israelis. It is 
the right of the Palestinian nation to oppose the accord and to 
fight for the liberation of its land. More importantly, 'Arafat 
has given the Israelis a guarantee of security and has 
considered the control of the Palestinians as one of his duties. 
However, despite that, the Israelis have, nevertheless, 
guaranteed the unjust right to enter that same confined area 
that was put at the disposal of Mr. 'Arafat for self-rule any 
time they wish. In fact, he becomes a mayor of that area. 
Whenever--this is categorically stated in the accord--whenever 
they consider it necessary to enter the area for their security, 
they will do so. In fact, the Palestinian nation has not 
achieved anything. Moreover, they seek to divest it of its main 
right, which is fighting for the liberation of its lands. 
  That is why the intifadah does not accept the accord. The 
number of those who do not accept the accord is far larger than 
the number of those who accept it. I venture to say that if 
there were to be a referendum or a similar plebiscite, the 
accord will undoubtedly fail to gain any votes. Undoubtedly, 
those supporting the accord will be in the minority. The 
movement is still continuing, either by the Palestinians inside 
or those outside. 
  [Correspondent] We see that the United States and Egypt 
especially, among the Arab states, are mostly seeking to 
internationalize the issue. They invite various states to gather 
in Cairo, as well as movies and satellite films, etc. Is all 
that for the same reason? Is it all for raising the issue and 
establishing the issue, or are there other reasons for it? 
  [Sheykholeslam] In fact, since the weakness of the accord at 
its heart is obvious to the Arab states, they are trying to get 
it accepted by the Arab nation through much propaganda and hue 
and cry. Despite all the invitations extended by the Egyptian 
Government to the foreign ministers of various states, there was 
not good participation. Foreign ministers of principal states, 
such as Lebanon and Syria, were not present. 
  There is no doubt that the weakness of the accord was 
evident 
both in the minds of the Americans and the Israelis. That was 
even evident yesterday at the scene of the signing of the 
accord, as it was being shown in the news bulletin. I was 
watching the Egyptian television's live broadcast. 'Arafat 
hesitated in signing some sections and demonstrated that even he 
did not wish to accept the accord. Then, as a result of the 
dominating pressure of the leaders of states there, 
unfortunately, he eventually signed. It is regrettable that the 
fate of the Palestinian nation was exchanged for the sake of 
several presidents and foreign ministers. 
  In any case, the Americans and some other big countries want 
no one to oppose the accord. That, in itself, is evidence to 
the weakness of the accord. It is clear that opposition can 
damage it. 
  [Correspondent] Considering the role of Arab countries, 
perhaps we can divide them into two groups--the countries that 
do not share borders with occupied Palestine, and those who are 
next to it such as Syria and Jordan. How do you see the role of 
each of those countries? 
  [Sheykholeslam] Some of those countries, like Syria, adopted 
a better stance from the beginning. Syria is calling for 
Israel's complete withdrawal from the Golan, which has been 
occupied by Israel. I should mention that Syria has resisted 
well despite various pressure exerted by some Arab and large 
countries like America, and sometimes Russia, and has not given 
up its fundamental stances. Christopher brought various plans 
during his recent visit, and the Syrian reaction so far does not 
indicate that the Syrians have accepted Christopher's plans. 
Those plans are about Israel's withdrawal from three villages. 
  Lebanon has adopted a very good stance so far. Their stances 
have been in coordination with those of the Syrians. [passage 
omitted] 
  Jordan, with its large Palestinian population, tried to see 
that the accord developed in a way that did not harm it. 
[passage omitted] 
  Egypt is left, which is obvious. Unfortunately, a wrong step 
was taken by Anwar Sadat, and Egypt has left the camp of 
struggle against Israel since then. 
  On the whole, the stances of the countries who live next to 
Palestine are, unfortunately, not very solid, and they accept 
the presence of Israel due to their need or dependency on the 
United States. That is a great danger that threatens the Arab 
world in the future. 
  [Correspondent] If you allow me, I would like to raise my 
final question. Please tell us about the Islamic Republic of 
Iran's position with respect to the recent accord? 
  [Sheykholeslam] The position of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has been clear from the beginning. Since before the revolution 
in Iran, his eminence the imam believed that Israel should be 
destroyed. It is an illegitimate creation that has been imposed 
on the region. [passage omitted] 
  Naturally, the Islamic Republic of Iran supports all 
oppressed nations and their struggles--such as the Bosnians. It 
also supports the struggle of the Palestinian nation, 
particularly since the Muslims' first Qiblah, the Holy Quds, is 
there. The accord has no grounds whatsoever, and one of the 
main slogans that says Quds must be the capital of Palestine has 
been ignored. Only a request has been made by Mr. 'Arafat in 
his speech that the holy place should remain open to Muslim 
pilgrims. 
  It is said that the Israelis have not even mentioned the 
holy 
places by their real Islamic names in the maps that they have 
prepared, which is regrettable. The accord offers nothing but 
abjectness. Fortunately, the Palestinian nation is on the 
scene, resists, and continues to roar for its rights. 
  We condemn the accord and support the Muslim nation of 
Palestine and their struggle. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Sheykholeslam, thank you for coming to 
our studio.

  [Text] Beirut, May 9, IRNA -- Four Iranian diplomats who 
were abducted in 1982 are alive and have been handed over to 
Zionist regime's officials in occupied Palestine, a source close 
to Lebanese Government disclosed here Monday. 
  The source, who is close to Lebanese minister of hydraulic 
and electrical resources Ilyas Hubayqah, told IRNA here Monday 
that the Iranians were delivered to Zionist regime by elements 
affiliated with head of Lebanese Maronite Party Samir Ja'ja'. 
  He said the hostages who were three Iranian diplomats along 
with Islamic republic news agency's photographer were taken as 
hostage when they came across a Lebanese paramilitary troops' 
checkpoint in 1982. They were taken to occupied Palestine via 
sea last year once Geagea was forced to quit his command 
headquarters. 
  Since then, Iranian officials repeatedly have called for 
their release, but Lebanese paramilitary troops have refused to 
acknowledge that they are holding the four Iranian hostages. 
  Families of the hostages have also offered documents to the 
international bodies, appealing for their release. 
  Foreign Minister Velayati also in a letter last month called 
on his Lebanese counterpart Faris Bouez to probe into the issue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Despite the fact that Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad 
Sifi came to power over one month ago, there has been no effort 
made toward establishing comprehensive discussions. Instead, 
government officials repeat their promises and sometimes pledge 
new ones. 
  In his latest speech, the Algerian prime minister promised 
to 
hold parliamentary elections soon, but said this depends on the 
outcome of talks among the country's political forces. Sifi 
also emphasized that all factions respecting the Constitution 
and the law can participate in the talks. 
  But it seems that such statements are somewhat in 
contradiction to government practices, and that the new Algerian 
Government insists on repeating the mistakes of its predecessors. 
  What could be the meaning of talks and a pretense of 
reconciliation whene leaders of the most important political 
organization are in prison, and while the government does not 
even recognized them? 
  In the opinion of most political observers, the current 
Algerian statesmen are trying to play for time because they 
realize that they can not have the upper hand in any dialogue, 
and to achieve supremacy it is necessary to guarantee the 
support of other parties other than the Islamic Salvation Front 
[FIS]. In other words, a coalition should be formed against the 
Front, and public opinion should become skeptical of the nature, 
operation and aims of the Front in order to reduce its popular 
support. Political experts thus see yesterday's demonstrations 
in Algeria within this context. 
  Thousands of people participated in a peaceful march and 
called for an end to violence and the continuation of talks. 
  According to news agency reports, parties close to the 
government had organized the demonstrations, with the support of 
the police. Political experts say that the move was designed to 
agitate public opinion against FIS and to measure popular 
tendencies, but it was cooly received and was countereffective. 
  Meanwhile, it was announced in Algeria that two French 
citizens were killed after being targeted by armed men. France 
is the main foreign supporter of Algeria's military government, 
and last year, Islamic combatants warned that -- in order to end 
western governments' support -- western citizens would be 
targeted and that they they must leave Algeria before the end of 
the year. 
  But attacks against foreigners came to an end following 
promises of talks with Islamists. It now seems, however, that 
FIS leaders prefer not to put hope in the empty official 
promises, which only gives more time to the ruling military to 
uproot Muslim combatants and destroy their organization, and 
thus attain obtain its own interests in the political arena.

  [Text] Dr. Velayati, our foreign minister, and his 
accompanying high-level diplomatic delegation, who are on a 
visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, were accorded a warm 
welcome yesterday by the Bosnians. These people had gathered 
around the president's house hours before the arrival of the 
Iranian delegation, expressed their appreciation for Iran's 
selfless compassion and the unstinting assistance of our people. 
  During the visit by 'Ali Akbar Velayati to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the first Iranian ambassador was introduced 
in Sarajevo, and brief talks were held between the officials of 
the two countries. In his meeting with Dr. Velayati, President 
Alija Izetbegovic said: Had it not been for the support of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, the struggles of the Bosnian Muslims 
would certainly have had a different fate. 
  In this meeting, Dr. Velayati described the resistance of 
the 
people of Bosnia-Herzegovina as inspiring pride. He added: The 
Islamic Republic of Iran is on the side of the Bosnian Muslims 
with all its might. It may be mentioned that the visit of the 
Iranian delegation lasted 10 hours in all and at present, Dr. 
Velayati is in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. 
  In his first round of talks with the Croatian prime 
minister, 
Velayati stressed the common stances of Tehran and Zagreb as 
regards the need for greater seriousness on the part of the 
United Nations for resolving the crisis in the Balkan region and 
he criticized the procrastination and inattention of the 
Security Council. Dr. Velayati described the UN's 
procrastination and failure to implement the Security Council's 
resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina as unprecedented in the 
history of the organization. 
  Dr. Velayati also participated in a press conference along 
with the Croatian prime minister. The latter hailed Iran's 
support for a federation between the Bosnian Croats and Muslims 
and expressed his appreciation for Iran's efforts to resolve the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. In this press conference, Dr. 
Velayati referred to the Croatian prime minister's visit to 
Tehran last week and deemed the tripartite session of 
Tehran-Zagreb-Sarajevo, useful and effective for the 
establishment of peace and security in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It may be mentioned that last week, on the invitation of 
Iran, two high-level delegations from Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Croatia had visited Tehran and important talks had taken place 
to resolve the crisis in the Balkan peninsula. The current 
visit by the Iranian diplomatic delegation to this area is in 
fact considered a continuation of the talks in Tehran.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Murderer Suddenly Escaped"] </F>
  [Text] The head of the cultural center of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in Lahore, Pakistan was killed by members of 
the Seoah-e Sahaba Wahhabi group [extremist Sunni group 
allegedly supported by Saudi Government] in the month of Azar 
[22 November-21 December] in 1367 [year beginning 21 March 
1990]. The Pakistani Government arrested eight persons in this 
case. The group members were interrogated and the leaders were 
sentenced to be executed. However, this sentence was never 
carried out due to the pressure of certain influential groups. 
  A few days ago, Pakistani publications carried a brief 
report 
on the escape of Rashid Sabra, one of the members of the group, 
while he was being escorted to the special tribunal, in what 
seemed to be a clearly manipulated scenario. 
  Sabra's escape may be viewed by the local Pakistani 
officials, including the provincial Punjab government, as a 
normal incident but in the Iranian public's opinion, this shows 
a lack of decisiveness in a bilateral issue. The provincial 
government affiliated with the Muslim League, which claims to be 
more Islamist than the ruling Pakistan People's Party, can only 
mar the friendly relations between the two Muslim countries of 
the region with such an attitude. This also raises the question 
in the minds of the Shiites about what country is giving orders 
to the Muslim League leadership. 
  The protection of the lives of citizens and diplomats 
resident in every country is the responsibility of the central 
government, on the basis of international protocols. When Ganji 
was martyred, the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
displayed immense restraint and poise and merely requested that 
the culprits be punished. However, it did not receive any firm 
or categorical response. 
  Riaz Sabra is a Pakistani citizen who acted on instructions 
from some subservient group and martyred one of the cultural 
officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran and who has become 
linked to the tarnishing of bilateral relations. 
  Therefore, if the Pakistani Government does not agree with 
the rumors currently circulating about the nature and the modus 
operandi of the Sepah-e Sahaba group, it should immediately 
issue orders for Sabra's arrest and should execute the sentence 
against all the accused persons of the group. Otherwise, the 
protests by public opinion will only wound the religious 
susceptibilities of the Iranian people and will certainly 
motivate the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
display an official reaction.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Dr. Hasan </F>
Rowhani, Ayatollah Khamene'i's deputy on the Supreme National 
Security Council, by an unidentified RESALAT correspondent in 
Tehran; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [RESALAT] As the secretary of the Supreme 
National Security Council, what image of domestic and external 
security would you project for the Islamic Republic of Iran? 
What would constitute the most serious threats at home and 
abroad? 
  [Rowhani] The image of national security is wonderful, 
although not ideal. We are talking of the security of a country 
in which there were changes in every area 15 years ago, when a 
rare kind of revolution reached fruition. This revolution has 
numerous enemies. Similarly, we have put behind us a prolonged 
and major war that lasted eight years, the marks and effects of 
which have not been obliterated. We are constantly encountering 
the mischief-making of the counterrevolutionary groups. 
  Compared with our Northern, Eastern, and Western neighbors, 
our security is remarkable. The condition of our Southern 
neighbors is different and a vast array of foreign military 
forces is present. We should view their situation differently. 
In those areas, security is provided by others and for their 
own interests. 
  We still have some centers of insecurity in the west and 
east 
of the country. In the West, Iraq is the root cause of 
insecurity. In Kordestan, the vestiges of lackey grouplets 
remain active. A country that has borne the brunt of war for 
eight years, a war that has included security issues, cannot 
efface them fast. [passage omitted] 
  In the eastern regions we have pockets of insecurity 
stemming 
from the problem of narcotics. The issue of combating drug 
smugglers is tackled mostly for human considerations. 
Generally, the smugglers do not want to distribute drugs in 
Iran. They mostly want their goods to transit through Iran. 
The center for manufacturing narcotics is in a region outside 
Iran, between Pakistan and Afghanistan. They want to use Iran 
as a route to convey the drugs to Europe and the United States. 
The primary users of drugs are the Americans and then the 
Europeans. 
  The main drug dealers and smugglers are also in the United 
States and Europe. At times, even Western officials are 
involved in this smuggling, which was exposed during recent 
humiliating discoveries in Europe and the United States. 
  If the corruption in Europe and the United States and the 
straying of their youth were not important for us, we could 
ignore our campaign against the smugglers and, naturally, the 
eastern regions of the country would become completely safe. 
  It is because of our sense of responsibility toward the fate 
of mankind that we continue this struggle against these death 
peddlers. Unfortunately, the Westerners are not only ungrateful 
to our self-sacrificing forces, they castigate us for our 
treatment and execution of the smugglers and label it human 
rights violations. 
  But we consider ourselves beholden to the fate of humans, as 
the happiness, health, and good fortune of our fellow beings is 
one of our mottoes. Thus we can say that we have two centers of 
insecurity, one of which relates to Iraq and the other to 
narcotics. [passage omitted] 
  [RESALAT] If possible, let us get to the second part of the 
question, that is, what is the most important threat? 
  [Rowhani] We perceive no real threats, whether at home or 
abroad. Every country plans its security around potential 
threats, which we also face inside and outside the country. 
  In a discussion regarding internal security, a potential 
threat could be that the people become indifferent to the system 
and the aspirations of the revolution. The day the people 
become indifferent and do not feel that this country and 
revolution belong to them, or that the burden of this revolution 
is on their shoulders, will be the day when we should feel 
danger. People are the greatest repository of the strength of 
the country's system. If the people do not remain active in the 
political, social, and economic arenas, we will face 
difficulties everywhere. 
  The enemy has invested much in this regard and constantly 
seeks--by disseminating innuendo, fallacious statistics, and 
rumors--to project the impression that the revolution has done 
nothing for the people, deliberately downplaying its 
achievements and magnifying minor problems. They want to 
deprive the revolution of its greatest asset, that is, the 
people. [passage omitted] 
  In the sphere of foreign threats, while we are not in a 
state 
of war, a potential threat does exist. There are so many 
foreign warships alongside our water. They can provoke 
countries and even attack us and initiate a war. 
  We perceive the prime factor in terms of a foreign threat in 
the United States, which is a real threat for us. This threat 
is the powers of world arrogance spearheaded by the United 
States and its lackey in the region, that is, Israel. Israel 
implements the United States' instructions. If today we have no 
real threat we should still be wary of malicious enemies. 
[passage omitted] 
  [RESALAT] By changing the political geography of Iraq, the 
powers of world arrogance are seeking to create an area under 
Kurdish domination that will ultimately lead to the 
establishment of a greater Kurdistan. Is this not a danger to 
our security? 
  [Rowhani] We are opposed to the dismemberment of Iraq and 
basically all kinds of changes in the political geography of the 
region. This is something we have proclaimed frequently. It is 
unlikely that this will seriously happen in the region. Even if 
it does, it will pose no threat to us. 
  First, I should explain that there is a great difference of 
opinion among the Westerners in this regard. Europe believes in 
one thing, the United States in another. Even among the 
Europeans, there is no consensus of opinion. Turkey has a 
specific viewpoint. The issue is not so simple that in northern 
Iraq they can so easily create a country called Kurdistan. The 
countries in this area are very sensitive about this issue, 
especially Turkey. 
  If we were to hypothesize that one day Iraq is dismembered 
and a Kurdish government is set up in northern Iraq, this would 
not be a threat to us. The people of our Kordestan have 
realized--with this experiment in autonomy in northern Iraq--the 
problems that have been generated. They know the hands of the 
colonialists want to manipulate them constantly and use them in 
ploys and as puppets. Our Kords have realized that the 
colonialists seek only their own interests. 
  We do not differentiate among the Kurds, Turks, or Farsis in 
Iran. There is no restriction anywhere in Iran, neither in the 
universities nor in the Majles. Any Kord can be a candidate and 
become a Majles deputy and participate in the legislative 
decisions like all the other deputies. In some countries, 
people are not even ready to mention the term, Kurd. The 
country that has the most Kurds refers to them as mountain Turks 
and is not willing even to use the word "Kurd." They have 
problems but we have no problems right now. Apart from some 
residual activity by grouplets affiliated with the colonialists 
and great powers and Iraq--and their number is quite 
negligible--we have no security problem. You witnessed the 
dazzling presence of the Kordish people in the 11 February 
marches in the Kord-inhabited cities. 
  The people of Kordestan came of their own accord and 
expressed their sentiments toward the system and the revolution. 
The participation of people in the Kord-inhabited cities during 
the elections is never less than in other areas. We have never 
felt any sense of danger from these areas. 
  [RESALAT] You mentioned threats from the United States. You 
know that last year economic relations between Iran and the 
United States increased considerably. German officials said 
that the United States is Iran's main economic partner. Isn't 
this closeness to the United States a threat to our interests? 
What is your opinion? 
  [Rowhani] Our relations with the United States were severed 
in the diplomatic, military, and cultural fields and there is no 
contact of any kind between us and the United States in these 
areas. Our economic contacts are not official, merely continuing 
since 1359 [year beginning 21 March 1980]. Economic relations 
between [Iranian] companies and American companies were never 
severed. These relations have occasionally been weak, even 
moderate, especially in the area of the purchase of oil by 
American companies. 
  Nearly anytime we sold oil on the international market the 
American companies bought it. The high figure that is sometimes 
quoted is a two-way figure, much of it pertaining to the 
purchase of our oil by American companies. 
  [RESALAT] What is the figure? 
  [Rowhani] I have no precise figures but mostly it concerns 
the purchase of oil. Last year the volume of exchanges with us 
increased, with a very positive result. This is because the 
United States constantly exerted pressure on Europe and Japan to 
reduce their volume of trade with Iran. The Americans asked: 
Why do you not reduce the level of your trade relations with 
Iran? Why do you purchase goods from Iran and make its economy 
flourish? The announcement of these figures has now floored 
them completely. 
  Now most of the G-7 countries openly attack the United 
States 
and ask: Why did you ask us to reduce the quantum of our trade 
with Iran when you yourself have increased your trade relations 
with Iran? This topic has generated serious discord among 
them. I believe that the ploy the Americans had in hand and 
wished to use against the Islamic Republic of Iran has been lost. 
  It is to our benefit that our real trading partners, namely 
Japan and Europe, should know that there is another competitor 
and this gives our companies greater strength to maneuver in 
international economic relations. 
  It is clear that in this rivalry, we have a greater choice 
in 
our hands, which will bring prices down, raise the quality, and 
ensure greater facilities. We must consider our own interests 
in trade relations. I think the United States has been exposed 
before the Europeans and the Japanese and a blow has been dealt 
to its credibility. 
  [RESALAT] But there is another danger. If there comes a time 
when only American companies are the buyers of our oil or of 
much of it, and if they suddenly decide not to buy the oil, this 
will undoubtedly cause us a lot of problems. Will it not? 
  [Rowhani] You should see who buys our oil in the market. In 
any case, a considerable percentage is bought by the Americans 
on the international market. But we have never relied on this 
purchase. The volume of our sales is not such that it could 
generate problems for us. 
  The basis of the policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
always been to diversify and not depend on one source. If a 
problem arises, we will have room to maneuver and solve our 
problem. But in the case of the United States, our sales from 
American companies should be restricted to what is absolutely 
necessary. Nothing else. 
  [RESALAT] No clear answer has been received from our 
officials on our debts, that is, on why and how we ran up such 
debts. Who is responsible for this and what will be our 
situation? 
  [Rowhani] We have few problems with debts. 
  [RESALAT] Would this not be a question of security? 
  [Rowhani] In this context, every issue can become a security 
issue from a particular perspective, be it political, cultural, 
economic, or even educational. I wish to state that our debts 
are not high, no more than expected. Our debts are what was 
envisaged in the first Five-Year Plan. We permitted the 
government to make the pledges. 
  [RESALAT] The period for repaying foreign debts will expire 
in the next two or three years. Do you not think that this will 
create a serious problem for the next president? 
  [Rowhani] There are two factors for the next presidential 
tenure: One is that the main projects in which we have invested 
in recent years will become operational and the future president 
need only inaugurate these projects. [second factor not 
mentioned] 
  Of course there is the problem of debts but these are not 
expected to reach a very mind-shattering level, so we foresee no 
serious problem. 
  If we depend only on oil then we will always have this 
problem. 
  [RESALAT] The projection was $27 billion but we have now 
pledged over $30 billion. The nature of the debts varies. 
  [Rowhani] We will manage one way or the other. The volume 
is not such that it would be very amazing. Our commitments are 
below $30 billion, that is, nearly the amount envisaged in the 
Plan. They do not overstep the prescribed limits and are within 
the volume projected. 
  To have foreign commitments worth 20 plus billion dollars is 
not a very big deal. It is quite natural for a country with an 
income of $20-25 billion to have foreign commitments on the same 
level. This is lower than the international norm. If the 
projections in the Plan had been envisaged in foreign exchange 
earnings, these problems would not have arisen. 
  For example, we predicted in the Plan that the quantity of 
our nonoil exports should be approximately $18 billion. We 
viewed this in the context of our total income. But the export 
of our nonoil products is not within our control such that we 
can incorporate it in our programs. 
  Our other problem was the slump in oil prices, which created 
problems with regard to our reimbursements. Oil prices are very 
inappropriate as there is too much of a difference from the OPEC 
base price. 
  Another problem is the parity of the dollar. The 
fluctuations the dollar has had in the course of the first 
Five-Year Plan have cost us $6 billion, because we sell against 
the dollar and buy mostly against the mark. 
  That we have $25-30 billion of foreign commitments poses no 
problem, in view of our income. Our problem stems from the 
collective repayment falling due soon. Our problem is not the 
commitment but the cash flow. We made short-term commitments, 
which would have caused no problems had they been medium or 
long-term ones. So it just happened that some repayments fell 
due all at the same time and created this situation. 
  Some may say our foreign exchange management is weak and 
that 
we could have organized it better. But it is not easy to pin 
down who is to blame, as most of the decisions are made 
collectively by the Supreme Economic Council and the Cabinet. 
[passage omitted] 
  [RESALAT] The necessary forecasts should have been made. 
Again this makes the management answerable. 
  [Rowhani] True, the government, the Central Bank, and the 
Majles should have anticipated this situation but the fact is 
that when the Five-Year Plan was being compiled, there was no 
way of foreseeing that the oil price would plummet so much. No 
one could have thought that oil prices would reach the level 
they reached in 1353 [year beginning 21 March 1974]. (The value 
of the dollar is under 10 percent of what it was then). 
  [RESALAT] In view of its experiences in 1372 [year beginning 
21 March 1993], the Majles has presented a more realistic budget 
for 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994], applying much caution 
and thought. For example, it is specified how much will be 
allocated to the repayment of commitments from our anticipated 
income. The Majles made this allocation and included different 
scenarios with a different plan to be followed in each case. As 
for our commitments, I can sum up briefly: 
  1. The volume of the outstanding debts did not exceed what 
was envisaged in the Five-Year Plan. 
  2. All the problems that arose were not the fault of the 
management. If the oil price had not slumped and we had not had 
a cashflow problem, this situation would not have arisen. I am 
optimistic that with the attention the Majles and the president 
will pay to this issue, we will have no similar problems in 
future. Of course, we have found some specific solutions for 
the repayment of our debts and the problem of careless debts has 
almost been solved. 
  But because of the caution by the Majles, the budget for 
this 
year is rather tight. Ministers don't usually favor such 
budgets.

  [Text] Tehran, May 6, IRNA -- A Central Bank advisor after 
reviewing the current economic developments, has said that Iran 
which has a population of 60 million, last year earned dlrs 7 
billion through exports and this means that many capacities have 
been created in the country. 
  Dr. Kashani said at the joint assembly of the Chambers of 
Commerce of Iran and Germany, last night that it is true that 
the country and the banks over the past two years faced delay of 
payments but for this loss during the past four years more work 
was done than predicted in the first 5-year plan. The average 
growth of 8.1 per cent gnp is a good sympton of what the country 
has gained, he added. 
  He said in the year 1367 (1988-89) Iran imported 4.5 to 5 
million tons of wheat every year while this figure in the years 
1371 and 1372 (1993-94) decreased to 2.5 million tons. 
  The importation of almost four million tons of iron and 
steel 
in 1367 was changed to the export of one million tons of these 
materials in 1372, according to Kashani. 
  Referring to the fact that the capacity of oil production in 
the country has reached from 2.5 million bpd in 1367 to 4.5 bpd 
last year, he said Iran's five-year development plan has proved 
it success with less than 500 foreign experts, and the growth of 
its capital formation has reached 23 per cent of GNP. 
  Another official, Allahyari, said in the same meeting that a 
committee had been set up at the office of the economic affairs 
deputy at the presidential office, involving the Ministries of 
Economy and Finance, Commerce, the budget and planning 
organization and the Central Bank to control the level of the 
country's foreign exchange commitments. 
  He expressed hope that Iran and Germany will make progress 
in 
cultural areas also in view of their good relations in the 
economic and trade fields. 
  Head of the Chamber of Commerce 'Ali-Naqi Khamoushi said the 
relations between Iran and Germany were never severed even 
during the imposed war (1980-88). 
  He said certain mischievous hands were trying to mar the two 
countries' good relations.

  [Excerpt] The annual export share of the industrial sector, 
affiliated to the Industries Ministry, was 42 percent of the 
country's total industrial exports figure in the year 1372 
[Iranian year ending 20 March 1994]. 
  While announcing this, the industrial and production affairs 
deputy of the Industries Ministry said today in an exclusive 
interview with our correspondent: The country's industrial 
exports figures increased from 60 million dollars in the year 
1368 to 440 million dollars in the year 1372. Thanks to the 
growing trend of exports, it is forecast that the figure will 
increase to 500 million dollars in the current year. 
  He added: A stable rate of foreign currency, precise 
planning 
of industrial projects, and stability of the country's economic 
policy are very effective factors in oiling the wheels of the 
country's industry. He further stressed that the foreign 
currency earned from the non-oil exports fully meets the demands 
of the industrial sector for hard currency. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, May 7, IRNA -- According to an official of 
the Ministry of Guidance only the journals that follow the 
strategy of the Islamic system will be supported. 
  The managing director for the domestic press section of 
Culture and Islamic Guidance Ministry Mojtaba Hamedani told IRNA 
here Friday that the press should take into consideration 
objectives of the system, press duties, existing realities and 
the demands of the majority of the people if they claimed they 
were concerned over the cultural growth of the country. 
  "The press and publications acting in accordance with the 
law 
will be supported," Hamedani said. He added that criticism and 
discussing practical strategies to solve the problems was the 
main raison d'etre of the press. 
  He also added that there would be some facilities in the 
future for the press such as a press house, press club and other 
facilities for journalists.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, May 9 (AFP)--The 
Palestinian police force opened a liaison office Monday [9 May] 
inside the Israeli Army's new military headquarters on the Gaza 
Strip, a PLO official said. 
  The bureau would be manned 24 hours a day to try to settle 
problems as they arose under autonomy, the official told AFP. 
  The HQ overlooks Ganei Tal, a settlement in the main Jewish 
area of occupation which surrounds the Palestinian town of Khan 
Yunis. The Army shifted there from Gaza City to facilitate their 
mission to protect Israeli settlers. 
  Meanwhile, Israeli military administration officials at Khan 
Yunis and Rafah called in local Palestinian dignitaries for a 
farewell ceremony on Monday. 
  The PLO official said the new police force would soon take 
over the buildings. 
  About 300 policemen were to cross into the newly-autonomous 
strip at the Rafah border with Egypt later Monday, Palestinian 
and Israeli officials said. 
  PLO leaders on the strip earlier met senior Palestinian 
employees of the administration to prepare the transfer of 
civilian authority. 
  Palestinian officials said the meeting at the PLO's 
temporary 
police headquarters in Gaza City covered the range of civilian 
affairs, from identity cards to telephones, health, education 
and employment. 
  No date has been set for the Israelis to hand over to the 
Palestinians responsibility for running their daily lives, but 
the officials said it would take place gradually over the coming 
days.

waging heroic battles in the al-'Alam area, 20 km from the 
beloved economic and trade capital, Aden, and approaching the 
last dens of the secessionist-plotting gang within the YSP 
leadership. 
  Today, these forces were able to besiege the misled elements 
of the [name indistinct] Brigade and a great number of its 
officers and men surrendered. The brigade's arms, equipment,

  [Text] O masses of our lofty Yemeni people everywhere: The 
rotten clique is perpetrating its evil scheme against our people 
and their brave Armed Forces. This clique aims at destroying 
the homeland and wasting its resources. The separatist gang -- 
which is rebelling against constitutional legitimacy, led by the 
butcher, who is immersed in the blood of conspiracies against 
our people, the so-called 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and his clique -- 
is retaliating against Yemeni unity, your greatest achievement 
in the contemporary age. It is firing its missiles and shells 
on your historical and political capital, Sanaa, in order to 
annihilate its peaceful people. 
  It is not strange to see this gang, which killed and 
displaced thousands of Yemeni people in the black events of 
January 1986, seeking alliance with all devils and losing all 
sense of nationalism. 
  The sons of your brave Armed Forces are now waging the most 
honorable battle to purge the country of their filth. We will 
soon announce to you the crushing of the forces of apostasy, 
which reneged faith in God while raising the slogan of Communist 
ideology.

battalion and a BMP [Infantry Fighting Vehicle] company 
surrendered and joined the forces of constitutional legitimacy 
and the protection of Yemeni unity. 
  During the fierce battles on that axis, the aircraft of the 
rebellious secessionist gang made futile suicidal raids on our 
combat units and the city of al-Rahidah. The valiant 
anti-aircraft units confronted them and forced them to flee 
after downing two Sukhoi aircraft. 
  The heroic men in our glorious Armed Forces are continuing 
their heroic acts and destroying the dens and fortresses of the 
forces of apostasy and secession, so the homeland of September 
and October will remain glorious and united with its 
constitutional agencies and its legitimate leadership, and with 
the cohesion of all members of the society in this glorious 
trench, the trench of freedom and justice, the trench of unity, 
democracy, progress, and prosperity.

  [Excerpt] Tehran, 8 May (KUNA) -- It has been mentioned 
here today that joint forces belonging to different factions of 
the Iraqi opposition captured the headquarters of the third 
border brigade of the 18th division and the headquarters of the 
first and third companies of the aforementioned brigade during a 
surprise attack launched from different directions last Friday 
[6 May]. 
  A statement sent to KUNA today by the "holy warriors of the 
Islamic revolution" in Iraq, an organization based in al-Ahwar 
in southern Iraq, said forces belonging to Badr corps, which is 
the military wing of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic 
Revolution in Iraq, supported by forces of the "holy warriors" 
and men of the people's resistance, "launched the surprise 
attack from many directions on Friday evening" on the 
abovementioned headquarters and succeeded in controlling them 
after penetrating them. 
  The statement pointed out that the attacking forces managed 
in the early hours of their campaign to "completely attack" the 
regime's forces, killing and wounding tens of them. They also 
destroyed a number of tires [as received], apparatus, large 
quantities of weapons, and stacks of equipment. 
  The statement also pointed out that large quantities of 
weapons and equipment have been seized at the headquarters of 
the third border brigade and the headquarters of the first and 
third companies. 
  A subsequent statement announced that the opposition forces 
have repulsed a counterattack carried out by a company 
[indistinct word] on the forces, which captured the headquarters 
of the third brigade and its ancillary companies and burned 
three of their carriers, including their occupants, and killed 
whoever attempted to advance, while the rest escaped. 
  This is considered the largest joint attack launched by the 
opposition factions for a long time. Observers believe the 
participation of the forces of Badr corps, which belongs to the 
Supreme Assembly, in the attack offers an indication that Iran 
has given the green light for the launching of the attack 
against the forces of the Iraqi regime, where the aforementioned 
corps possesses tanks, missile launchers, armored vehicles, and 
artillery. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Headlines" column by Fahd al-Fanik: "Christopher's </F>
Article on Sanctions"] 
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
published an article in THE NEW YORK TIMES on 29 April 1994 in 
which he attempted to justify the continuation of the inhuman 
sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people four years ago. 
  The secretary of state does not usually publish articles in 
the press. He may issue a statement, give a statement, or 
answer a question. It is also unusual for the secretary to send 
an article to a newspaper while he is conducting a difficult 
official mission and travelling between Middle Eastern capitals. 
The issue must have been more serious that it looks for the 
U.S. secretary to depart from tradition. 
  The meanings that can be deduced from the article do not 
depend much on its content, which was a repeat of the cliches we 
hear all the time: Iraq is not implementing the UN Security 
Council resolutions and the sanctions must continue. The more 
important meaning of the article is that the U.S. State 
Department has found itself in a position where it had to defend 
a racist policy rejected by the civilized world because it 
violates the most basic of human rights. Starting the article 
with a "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia" dateline is designed to suggest 
that the article is in response to an Arab demand. 
  The United States failed to give a clear answer to a 
specific 
question from Tariq 'Aziz: What measures is Iraq required to 
take to end the sanctions? 
  In fact, Iraq has complied with all the UN resolutions, 
although they were unfair. But the United States is not 
interested in seeing an implementation of the UN resolutions, 
which were never implemented by any country besides Iraq. 
Instead, the United States wants to change the ruling regime in 
Iraq and to impose on the Iraqi people other rulers of [Ahmad] 
al-Jalabi's type. 
  In his unconvincing defense of the continuation of the 
sanctions, Christopher admits they are causing real suffering 
for the Iraqi people. He, however, lays the blame on the Iraqi 
government's policy, as if the U.S. policy is not responsible 
for the continuation of the sanctions against the Iraqi people 
and for their elongation without any justified reason. 
  Thousands of the weakest segments of the Iraqi society are 
dying because of the U.S. sanctions. These are the children, 
the infants, the elderly, and the sick. Iraq's pharmacies are 
empty of insulin for diabetics and of medicine for people with 
chronic problems. Aspirin is also rare. Surgery in hospitals is 
limited because of the lack of anesthetics. All this is a crime 
against humanity, unparalleled even by Nazi crimes. 
  The continuation of the sanctions is purely an American 
decision. It does not infringe just on the rights of the Iraqi 
people, but also inflicts major damage on Turkey, Jordan, 
Europe, and Japan. It also offends anyone with a pan-Arab, 
humanitarian, and moral feeling. Trying to defend sanctions is 
even worse than the sanctions themselves.

  [Text] The transfer of powers to the Palestinians in 
Jericho has been delayed to Thursday, 12 May. Members of the 
subcommittee on civilian affairs, headed by Ghassan al-Shak'ah 
and Amin Maqbul, are currently touring the city and the Civil 
Administration's offices. Al-Shak'ah told our correspondent 
Moti Amir that the transfer of powers and buildings to the 
Palestinians will not take place today due to the delay in the 
arrival of the Palestinian policemen. According to him, the 
policemen will arrive in Jericho tomorrow, and the transfer of 
powers will take place on Thursday. The overlap between 
Palestinian representatives and Civil Administration officials 
in Jericho has just begun. 
  Major General Amnon Shahaq, the deputy chief of staff, 
toured 
the Gaza Strip today to oversee the work of the liaison 
committees with the Palestinians. Maj. Gen. Shahaq also visited 
the joint PLO-IDF [Israel Defense Forces] office. Our 
correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that the Palestinian 
policemen scheduled to deploy in the Gaza Strip have not yet 
arrived at the Rafah terminal. They will apparently arrive 
later this evening. 
  Nasr Yusuf, the commander of the Palestinian police force, 
arrived in the Gaza Strip this morning. An AFP correspondent 
reports that Gen. Yusuf entered the autonomy area alone through 
the Rafah border crossing and drove to Gaza.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. under secretary of State for Middle Eastern 
affairs, Robert Pelletreau, talking to reporters in Abu Dhabi 
yesterday, has made certain remarks about Iran and has once 
again raised the US officials' accusations, expressing concern 
over Iran's role in the region. 
  Mr. Pelletreau, a politician considered familiar with the 
affairs of Iran and that of the Middle East, during yesterday's 
press conference, by using such terms as Iran's ambitions for 
seeking regional domination and the use of terrorist approaches, 
tried to announce to other regional countries, through the mass 
media, the U.S. leaders' message of friendship and loyalty in 
defending the regional countries against the likely threat of 
Iran. 
  Of course, the U.S. under secretary of State for Middle 
Eastern affairs, in line with the task entrusted to him, also 
did not leave the point unsaid that his country continues to 
call for pressure and economic sanctions against Iran by the 
U.S.'s allies in Europe and other pro-Western countries. He 
stressed that the U.S. believes that this trend should continue 
until such time as Iran alters its policies and turns into a 
good neighbor in the Persian Gulf. 
  What the U.S. under secretary of state has said is neither 
new nor a new development in the U.S.'s outlook toward Iran, 
since, according to political analysts, it is not the first time 
that U.S. leaders are explaining their policies with respect to 
the Islamic Republic of Iran; they have done so on various 
occasions and under certain specific conditions in the past as 
well. 
  Despite this, Mr. Robert Pelletreau's explicit remarks in 
Abu 
Dhabi, in an overall assessment should be considered as 
indicative of the sensitivity U.S. leaders have always shown 
over the determining role of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the 
Persian Gulf region; a region that is extremely vital for the 
U.S. and its regional interests. 
  It is beyond doubt that seasoned American politicians are 
well aware of the reality that the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
achieved substantial progress in its political, economic, and 
cultural ties with its neighbors, especially in Central Asia and 
in the Persian Gulf region. Obviously these ties have not been 
shaped on the basis of Iran's fear in the region, rather, as has 
been clearly stated by the leaders of those countries, these 
ties are selective and are aimed at realizing joint bilateral 
interests with deep understanding of the need for the 
enhancement of regional ties for preserving peace and stability 
in the region. 
  Therefore, it is not unusual to see that the U.S. leaders, 
by 
using such terms as domination, threat for the region, or by 
warning the neighbors not to have close ties with Iran, try to 
justify the sale of more arms to the regional countries. Mr. 
Pelletreau also seems to have a short memory as, during his 
remarks in Abu Dhabi, he overlooked the point that, in his 
earlier report in March 1994, which was submitted to the Foreign 
Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives 
following the failure of U.S. efforts to isolate Iran on the 
international scene, he had described the Iranian Government as 
a permanent reality, adding that he was prepared to hold talks 
with Iranian officials on disputed issues.

    [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-ANWAR in Arabic on 6 May on 
pages 1 and 15 carries a 700-word report which includes the 
"text" of a letter allegedly sent to Qatari Amir Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani by his brother Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, a former education minister. The letter urges the 
dismissal of Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani 
for his "irresponsible" policies. 
  The letter points to the "negative consequences" of the 
foreign minister's meeting with his Israeli counterpart and to 
the continuing Arab media criticism of the "sudden change" in 
Qatar's foreign policy, "which has always been known for its 
courageous support for Arab causes in general and the 
Palestinian cause in particular." 
  Noting in his letter that the amir "always has concern for 
the higher interests of the country and the national interests 
of the Arab and Islamic nation," Shaykh Al Thani says: "With his 
reckless statements and irresponsible acts that demonstrate 
great vanity and arrogance, the foreign minister has destroyed 
Qatar's foreign policy and been a dismal failure, for which he 
deserves questioning and dismissal." The letter also accuses 
the minister of destroying the domestic economy as he worked "to 
serve his personal interests, disregarding the nation's economic 
interests." 
  The report goes on to say the letter, "which reveals a 
serious split in the royal family" is the second of its kind 
since the beginning of the year. It was distributed among some 
circles in Qatar and the other Gulf Cooperation Council 
countries when the country was hosting the multilateral talks on 
Middle East disarmament on 2-3 May, in which Israel 
participated. It says the first letter, in which Shaykh Al 
Thani "condemned the foreign minister's meetings with Israeli 
ministers and officials at the United Nations and in London," 
was sent to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and to Arab and 
foreign embassies in Doha.

  [Text] Riyadh, 7 May -- An official source has denounced an 
Israeli radio report today quoting Eytan Bentzur, the deputy 
director general at the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry, as 
saying that Saudi Arabia's stance, during the meetings held in 
Doha last week on the Arms Control and Regional Security 
Committee emanating from the Middle East multilateral talks, 
posed difficulties in the way of reaching agreements. 
  In a statement to the Saudi news agency, the source said 
that 
Saudi Arabia remains committed to the Gulf Cooperation Council's 
[GCC] decisions whose stance has been general and unified. 
  The source stressed that Saudi Arabia and the GCC states 
have 
not adopted a stance that poses difficulties, as Bentzur said. 
Posing difficulties, the source added, is procrastinating in 
the implementation of agreements.

  [Excerpts] Prince Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, second deputy 
prime minister and minister of defense and aviation, during a 
meeting with Arab ambassadors in Rome who had come to bid him 
farewell when he left Rome yesterday, and responding to their 
wish to know his highness' views on what is happening in Yemen, 
said: 
  We have learned from King 'Abd-al-'Aziz and his sons who 
succeeded him, may God bless them and have mercy on them, to put 
our responsibilities and duties toward our people and toward our 
Islamic and Arab nation before our personal comfort. 
  I had been intending to spend some time here, resting, and 
undergoing some routine medical examinations, but the start of 
fighting in the brotherly Yemen, and due to what I have been 
watching and hearing from the media channels, my heart bleeds 
with sorrow and sadness because of my acquaintance with the 
Yemeni leadership, people, and clans, and because of old 
friendship bonds. 
  I personally served Yemen and worked for its' development 
and 
encouraged its' leaderships, morally and financially, to advance 
the Yemeni people. 
  In front of this painful event that is sweeping Yemen, my 
personal comfort has diminished and I have decided to return to 
my headquarters to be at the disposal of the custodian of the 
two holy mosques and his crown prince, who are in constant and 
serious contact with their brethren kings, princes, and 
presidents of Arab countries in order to save Yemen from this 
painful fate, from the abyss it is sliding into. In particular, 
the Yemeni people, who have worked to build this unity between 
the two parts, which was blessed by Saudi Arabia when it was 
established with a positive spirit and in anticipation of a 
better future. 
  When disputes surfaced we were not surprised because 
brothers 
and friends disagree. But when the language of dialogue stops 
between brothers and the brothers resort to bloodshed, killing, 
wasting energies, and destroying the achievements -- which the 
Yemeni people attained with great difficulties -- to settle 
their differences, it then becomes a matter that brings sadness 
for every Arab and Muslim and bleeds the hearts that love Yemen, 
the country that we all love and appreciate. 
  I beseech God from the bottom of my heart to enlighten the 
brothers in Yemen to solve their differences by resorting to 
reason, logic, and dialogue aimed at serving Yemen's interests 
and sons. [passage omitted] 
  He said Yemen had high hopes in the Kingdom under the 
leadership of King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, as well as in Egypt 
under the leadership of President Husni Mubarak and all Arab 
leaders to find an urgent solution to stop the bloodshed and 
restore purity to Yemen.

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, 9 May -- Crown Prince 'Abdallah 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, deputy prime minister and chairman of the 
national guard, chaired the meeting of the Council of Ministers 
this afternoon in al-Yamama palace, in Riyadh. [passage omitted] 
  The council examined the development of the situation in the 
world's hotbeds of tension, and in this context, the council was 
briefed on the development of the situation in fraternal Yemen 
and the regrettable fierce fighting between brothers there. The 
council of Ministers affirmed the statement of the authorized 
Saudi source made last Thursday to the effect that the kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia urges all the fighting belligerents to show 
self-restraint, stop the internecine fighting, resort to reason 
as an arbitrator, and put the interest of Yemen above any other 
consideration. The council expressed the hope to see the 
brothers in Yemen respond to the call of the kingdom and the 
Islamic and sincere Arab patriotism prevail. The council calls 
for preserving the lives of the Yemeni people so as to put an 
end to these bloody events, together with prayers to God. Now 
that we are on the eve of the blessed pilgrimage season, a 
sacred month, the council hopes the brothers in Yemen resort to 
calm and reasonable dialogue to arrive at a solution that will 
bring about stability, security, and safety throughout all 
Yemen, both north and south. 
  Concerning the Palestine issue, the council of ministers 
considers that the signing last Wednesday in Cairo of the 
Palestinian self-rule agreement between the PLO and Israel as a 
practicle step on the road towards a just and comprehensive 
solution based on the UN resolutions. The council urges the 
co-sponsors of the peace process in the region to exert more 
efforts to give momentum to this process in all the other tracks 
so as to realize security and stability in the region. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] The president, His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan 
Al Nuhayyan, last night received a telephone call from President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih of the sisterly Republic of Yemen. The 
Yemeni president briefed President Zayid on the latest Yemeni 
developments. 
  Shaykh Zayid asked the Yemeni brothers to resolve their 
differences through reason, logic, and dialogue to serve Yemen 
and the Yemeni people. 
  President Zayid expressed his deep concern over the 
continued 
fighting in Yemen and appealed to all sides to stop fighting 
immediately to end the bloodshed and take the course of dialogue 
and understanding in preparation for resuming good offices and 
mediations to resolve differences and place the interests of 
Yemen and its people above all other considerations. 
  During the telephone conversation, the president said that 
he 
was confident that the Yemeni leaders and figures would be able 
to solve their differences and effect a brotherly reconciliation 
instead of shedding blood, killing, and wasting resources, 
something which saddens every Arab and Muslim. Yemen and its 
people are dear to us and we harbor great love for them. His 
highness said: We appeal to you to fear God in dealing with 
Yemen and its people and to resort to reason instead of arms. 
  His highness warned against aggravating the fighting and the 
resulting inability to control the situation and held the Yemeni 
leaders responsible. He said: We must give advice and do 
whatever we can to steer Yemen away from this painful fate. 
  His highness has been in constant contact with the leaders 
of 
fraternal Yemen for the past several days within his highness' 
endeavors to follow Yemeni developments.

<F P=106> ["Live dispatch" by 'Abd-al-Ghani Nasir al-Shamiri, radio </F>
and television correspondent in Mukayris] 
  [Text] Dear listeners: God's peace and blessings be upon 
you. I greet you from the valiant Mukayris district in the Abyan 
Governorate. Here is the true account of the progress of the 
purging of the strongholds of treason and separation. As for 
the 20th Brigade in Mukayris, the secessionist, rebellious 
traitors imagined that through this brigade and the 
extraordinary amounts of ammunition stored in it, they would be 
able to declare separation from this brigade. However, they 
were disappointed, for their evil plotting boomeranged against 
them. Our faithful, unionist forces managed on Thursday [5 May] 
at 1100 to seize the brigade, keeping its ammunition to defend 
the Yemen of unity of democracy, the Yemen of wellbeing and 
peace. As for the personnel of this brigade, some of them 
surrendered, while the others were captured. 
  The vanguards of the faithful, unionist forces are marching 
to pounce on the remnants of the [word indistinct] traitors and 
rebels, hammering the last nails in the coffin of separatists 
who rebelled against constitutional legitimacy and harbored evil 
and ill intentions against this beloved homeland. However, the 
unbelievers plotted and planned, and God too planned, and the 
best of planners is God. [koranic verse] 
  The vanguards of our valiant unionist and legitimate forces 
are removing the remaining dens of traitors, pounding their 
heads, which harbor secessionist illusions, and making them 
taste the bitter consequences of their evil intentions and acts. 
In al-Dayqah area this morning, the al-Wahadah Brigade forces 
under the command of Staff Colonel 'Abdallah Mansur engaged the 
rebellious secessionist forces of the 30th Brigade. Their 
forward forces were destroyed by our valiant, unionist forces, 
the defenders of unity, democracy, and constitutional 
legitimacy. Many personnel were detained and the entire 
equipment of those two brigades [as heard] were seized. 
  Our forces are now continuing to liquidate other units that 
continue to persist in their course of injustice, misguidance, 
rebellion, and separation.

rebellion, and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] for 
the sake of foiling the plan of hostility to the people, which 
is aimed at destroying the homeland, and of checking the 
intrigue of sabotaging the constitutional institutions in the 
country. Congratulations to you and to all the sons of our 
people in all the governorates of the republic, in Sanaa, Aden, 
Sa'dah, Abyan, Ta'izz, Lahij, al-Bayda', Hajjah, al-Maharah, 
al-Jawf, al-Hudaydah, Hadhramaut, Ma'rib, Shabwah, and all over 
Yemen. Congratulations to you on the victories of unity, 
freedom, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. You have our 
heartfelt greetings and thanks in all positions, on coasts, in 
valleys, and on mountains while you are supporting your 
legitimate leadership, constitutional institutions, and valiant 
Armed Forces in the battle of unity and fate, the battle of 
defending unity, freedom, and democracy, the battle of existence 
and fate, and the battle of defending unity, freedom, justice, 
and equality. 
  Greetings and appreciation to your gigantic Army, which is 
fulfilling the pledge to safeguard unity and democracy through 
its confrontation with the tyrannical secessionists in the YSP 
and their attempts to ignite the military situation and to 
foment sedition for the sake of achieving their personal 
purposes and fragmenting the homeland and undermining the 
people's unity. The army of unity and democracy confronted 
treachery and aggression and performed its sacred duties so as 
to uproot all the secessionist and traitorous fortifications and 
to destroy them one stronghold after another. Your army is, at 
this moment, on the brink of crushing with its confident mighty 
hand the secessionists' wicked fortifications by besieging their 
dens with cordons of fire. It will write with its hands on the 
gates of free Aden the true and profound meaning of freedom 
after this freedom has been abused for the past 30 years under 
the coercion and repression of the party's dictatorship and its 
theory of rancor against the people and all its classes, which 
have lived under all woes of humiliation, fear, and death under 
the policies, conflicts, and massacres of the unjust 
secessionist clique. We address the members of this clique: 
You may turn to the right and turn to the left, but you will 
always find behind you the angry sea with roaring waves that 
will toss you asunder, and in front of you the army of the state 
and the people, the army of wisdom and faith, whose battalions 
and brigades are devouring you. 
  O treacherous secessionists, remnants of the collapsing red 
communism, whichever way you turn your face and no matter what 
cloak of deception and trickery you try, no one will trust you 
because you have never trusted anyone. You have not even 
trusted each other. You did not trust the fortress of unity, 
the giant revolutionary and historic achievement that you sought 
to be a part of. Those who are conspiring against fate and the 
people for their selfish and personal interests and ambitions, 
will only reap ignominy and defeat. It has become clear that 
the red star fluttering above your heads, with which you have 
decorated the walls of your houses and camps, remains vivid 
evidence of your rancor, infidelity, sinfulness, and 
disobedience. 
  You, brother officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers 
in the military units under the control of the secessionist 
clique, must join the army of unity, freedom, and democracy, as 
some of your brothers did in 'Imran, Dhamar, Yarim, Sanaa, 
Abyan, Shabwah, and in the Aden Governorate. This is so that 
your loyalty is to God, the homeland, the revolution, and 
constitutional legitimacy. This is especially important since 
this loyalty constitutes the course of safeguarding your life 
and the blood of your comrades-in-arms, through which you will 
restore your prestige and position in life and in the Armed 
Forces. Then you may return to your honorable position of 
defending the unity and democracy in the battles of defending 
right, freedom, unity, democracy, and of safeguarding the 
sanctity of constitutional legitimacy. 
  Here are the dens of treason and the strongholds of the 
secessionists, collapsing before the soldiers who have faith in 
God and the homeland, and in unity and democracy. Do not be 
late in joining the ranks of the advancing forces of unity and 
legitimacy so that you will have the honor to triumph with them, 
for the will of the people, and so that you may safeguard 
history, which is now back on its true course after the 
achievement of unity and of fortifying it with democracy. Let 
the people be above all parties and have the upper hand. Let 
their interests be above all interests, selfishness, and 
parochial party policies, God willing.

  [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the 
Presidential Council, has explained that the military situation 
on various fronts is going in favor of our Armed Forces, the 
forces of constitutional legitimacy. He added that what is 
helping our Armed Forces decide the situation militarily against 
the secessionist elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] is 
the fact that large numbers of the forces that were under the 
control of these elements have joined the ranks of the forces of 
unity and legitimacy. 
  In a news conference held today, which was attended by a 
number of Arab and international newspaper, news agency, and 
radio correspondents, he said that the Armed Forces are now 
close to the area of Dar Sa'd, overlooking the city of Aden, and 
that they are continuing their advance toward the dens of the 
gang that rebelled against legitimacy. He pointed out that the 
situation in the governorate of Abyan was decided in favor of 
our Armed Forces on the day before yesterday, and that fighting 
has come to a complete halt in all combat areas in this 
governorate. 
  Fighting is now confined to the governorates of Lahij and 
Aden, where the forces of unity and legitimacy will soon finish 
their tasks in the two governorates. In this regard, brother 
'Abd-al-Ghani asserted that the military base under the control 
of rebels and secessionists in the area of al-'And in the 
governorate of Lahij is about to fall into the hands of the 
Armed Forces, which are conducting a firm siege on this base. 
  He denounced the criminal action that the rebellious and 
secessionist gang is carrying out by launching missile attacks 
on the capital, Sanaa, and on the governorates of Ta'izz and 
al-Hudaydah. These attacks targeted national and vital 
institutions. The objectives they sought by shelling these 
institutions were not achieved, and their evil wish foundered, 
so the missiles fell on mountains, hills, and valleys, as well 
as on some residential areas, he added. 
  Asked about the mediation efforts of certain states, the 
brother Presidential Council member said: For our part, we 
always announced that we support dialogue; we called for 
dialogue, and we committed ourselves to its results. We are 
also constantly committed to democratic policy, the 
constitution, and legitimacy. However, the rebellious and 
secessionist leaders in the YSP rejected dialogue. We now reject 
foreign mediations because what is taking place is an internal 
affair between legitimacy and those rebelling against it. 
Moreover, we vehemently reject mediation efforts that regard the 
conflict as one between two different regimes. This is because 
the conflict is one, the country is one, and the legitimacy 
exists in the House of Representatives, which was elected by the 
people on 27 April 1993. 
  Within this context, brother 'Abd-al-Ghani expressed great 
appreciation for the sentiments of the Arab brethren and friends 
throughout the world toward what is happening in our country. 
He asserted that there would be a Yemeni solution to the 
problem because the conflict is one between legitimacy and the 
rebellion against it. The world states should support 
legitimacy and democracy in our country, he added.

  [Text] Tunis, 10 May -- The dismissed head of the Yemeni 
Government, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, has called for a halt to 
the current fighting in Yemen, abandoning any ideas to divide 
the country, and using dialogue to solve the pending problems. 
  In an interview with the Tunisian EL-CHOUROUK, published 
today, he said: Entering war is an easy task we had cautioned 
against, but getting out of war is a difficult operation. 
  He attributed the military fighting in Yemen to the 
existence 
of forces he described as influential and clinging to their 
positions, which reject the provisions of the agreement signed 
by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid in the Jordanian capital Amman last February. 
  He added: These forces have waged war to maintain their 
control -- particularly the tribal one -- influence, and narrow 
interests in the country, throwing experience, the union, and 
everything away. 
  He added that the current situation in the Republic of Yemen 
mixes up the militarization of the regime and the tribe and the 
state, and this is the core of the problem and the main motive 
of the war, which has been fed by the influential forces in the 
country. 
  Mr. al-'Attas accused the previous leadership of Northern 
Yemen of not respecting the unity agreement signed in May 1990 
between the two northern and southern parts of Yemen. 
  He said the previous leadership of North Yemen had resorted 
to "the elimination of the leading members of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party through intimidation, assassinations, and 
various other actions." 
  Al-'Attas denied the existence of a regional factor in the 
fighting currently raging in Yemen. "There is no country 
influencing the events in Yemen or interfering to settle 
accounts," he said. "The reports talking about a role for the 
neighboring states to feeding the conflict are mere hearsay and 
misinformation designed to cover up the practices and behavior 
in this war, in which every Yemeni is a loser, and because of 
which unity, democracy and the future of Yemen in general are 
being slaughtered." 
  Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Salih dismissed yesterday 
evening Prime Minister Haydar Abu Bakr al-Attas and appointed a 
new defense minister, Staff Brigadier Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, to 
replace the dismissed southern Defense Minister Haytham Qasim 
Tahir.

<F P=106> [Reprot by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Socialist Party Leadership: </F>
Media Talk of Aden Siege Deception; North Accused on Shelling 
Civilians, Internationalizing War"] 
  [Text] London -- Dr. Sa'id Yasin Nu'man, chairman of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] Secretariat, has denied what he 
termed "rumors" about the northern forces' presence on the 
approaches to Aden. He stressed that the offensive of the 
forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih "has been curbed 
on all axes." He added that this compelled them to haphazardly 
shell the villages near their positions, destroying more than 30 
houses in al-Dali'. More than 80 families have been wounded in 
Kirsh. Both areas are in Lahij Governorate. 
  He said that haphazard bombardment by heavy artillery of 
residential areas has led to many casualties among women and 
children, who could not escape. And that the element of 
surprise has contributed to increasing the number of casualties. 
However, Dr. Nu'man declined to disclose any figures about the 
losses at the present stage. He said that "the haphazard 
bombardment has made it difficult, so the real results will not 
be known until later." 
  The interview, which was conducted over the telephone 
between 
London and Aden, was also joined by Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah 
(Muhsin), member of the YSP Political Bureau and minister of 
housing and rural planning. He said that "militias belonging to 
the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] are playing a major role in 
leading and launching the battle." He said that this falls 
"within the framework of qualifying themselves for assuming 
power at a later stage. Because they helped to spark off the 
crisis militarily. And they want matters in Yemen to proceed 
similarly to the way they did in Afghanistan." 
  Muhsin specifically accused 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anasi, deputy 
prime minister and secretary general of the YRG, "of throwing 
his party's weight behind the Yemeni president's military 
orientation. This orientation has confirmed what President Salih 
said to U.S. Envoy Robert Pelletreau, namely that he is fighting 
communism." 
  Muhsin said that "the YRG has a major role inside the 
northern political security organ." He expressed his 
astonishment at "the sudden emergence of the fundamentalist 
scheme." He added that "it now justifies its presence by 
controlling key positions." 
  He said that, "despite the current accord between the 
General 
People's Congress [GPC] and the YRG, a conflict is expected to 
occur between them at a later stage. Because there are 
indications in that direction, especially as the GPC faces have 
decreased in number in the southern and eastern governorates, 
while new YRG faces have begun to emerge and move actively." 
  Asked whether there is a foreign role in the Yemeni war, Dr. 
Nu'man said that "the use of non-Yemeni forces is clear. It 
proves that the battle has assumed other dimensions. So we do 
not know why they [the north] are turning down Arab efforts to 
secure a cease-fire." 
  To prove what he is saying, Dr. Nu'man added that "it seems 
that most of the foreign elements participating in the battle 
entered through the YRG, with the exception of the Iraqi role, 
which comes within the coordination between Sanaa and Baghdad." 
  He said that "southern forces have arrested three non-Yemeni 
officers in the al-Dali' area: a Sudanese, a Jordanian, and an 
Iraqi. They were participating in leading al-Hamzah Brigade 
operations. It has been proved that they were there without 
their governments' knowledge." He pointed out that they will be 
paraded soon on television screens before Arab and foreign 
public opinion. 
  Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah said that northern civilian planes 
have been moved to the airport of the Eritrean capital, Asmara. 
He added that a military delegation headed by Brigadier General 
al-Bashiri, former (northern) chief of staff, visited Eritrea 
and returned three days ago. However, he declined to comment on 
reports that northern warplanes are using Eritrean airports. He 
said: "We know nothing about that or about reports of a secret 
visit to Eritrea by the Yemeni president." 
  On the ongoing fighting between al-'Amaliqah forces and 
southern units in Abyan Governorate, Dr. Nu'man said that "the 
fighting is continuing. The al-'Amaliqah Brigade went there 
immediately after unity, to the areas agreed upon. When the 
crisis began, they deployed in the towns and villages near their 
positions. But they have now retreated from the positions they 
occupied." 
  He said that "al-'Amaliqah forces' retreat is attributable 
to 
the refusal of a large number of them to fight in accordance 
with the instructions issued to them by the GPC. As a result, 
the morale of the other troops has collapsed. But Sanaa 
reinforced them with additional troops." He said that they "do 
not know why they are fighting. The unity is there and the 
document is there, but they [the leaders] are refusing to 
implement them." 
  Dr. Nu'man rejected the reports and statements issued from 
Sanaa. He said: "They control communications and are 
misleading Arab and foreign media by saying that Aden is under 
siege -- which is remote from the truth, because people are 
living their life completely normally."

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Defense Ministry; place and date </F>
not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] For the fourteenth day in a row, the forces of the 
bloody gang of the al-Ahmar clan continue perpetrating their 
criminal acts against our Yemeni people and their valiant Armed 
Forces. Today, these iniquitous, savage acts are being 
perpetrated against the areas of al-Dali Province and the 
districts of Karish and Mukayris, which are the areas that were 
on the borders before Yemeni unity. In the al-Dali area, forces 
of the adventurist gang of the al-Ahmar clan continued to shell 
al-Dali town and its neighboring villages with heavy artillery, 
rockets, and aircraft in the tenth attempt to penetrate the 
defenses of our valiant forces which are confronting these 
iniquitous forces with total bravery and audacity. 
  The defenders of this province, in cooperation with the 
masses of the people which began to arrive in this province 
(?from) various provinces of Lahij Governorate, are displaying a 
valiant resistance and splendid heroism, which reflects the 
spirit of the original struggle between our forces and the 
masses. Despite the intensive random shelling against the 
peaceful villages and houses by the forces of the al-Ahmar gang, 
our defending forces continued their resolute confrontation, 
inflicting on the hostile forces heavy loss of life and 
equipment. 
  In another former border area, the adventurist Sanaa clique 
tried to capture (Kathbub) District in the direction of Bab 
al-Mandab [word indistinct], but our heroic forces repulsed this 
abortive attempt and the attacking forces of the al-Ahmar clan 
returned to where they came from, suffering losses. 
  As for the capital of Abyan Governorate, our forces have 
almost imposed their control of this area after units of the 
al-'Amaliqah forces retreated and scattered in all directions, 
while many of these units, officers and other ranks, surrendered 
and joined our forces. 
  The Defense Ministry appeals to Arab and world public 
opinion, particularly the bodies and organizations concerned 
with defending human rights, including the Yemeni Red Crescent, 
the Arab Red Crescent organizations, and the International Red 
Crescent, to condemn the murderous campaigns against captives 
who fell into the hands of the gang of the al-Ahmar clan in the 
northern governorates, as well as savage acts and random 
shelling of villages and houses of citizens, particularly in 
al-Dali Province and in Karish and Mukayris districts, and the 
forceful detention of these citizens. It calls on these 
organizations to intervene to rescue the wounded and provide 
first aid to them, particularly among the civilians. While the 
Defense Ministry conveys to our people and to the Arab and world 
these facts, it expresses full confidence that all the abortive 
attempts of the bloody gang of the al-Ahmar clan will fail. 
Their deeds will crash on the rock of our armed forces' 
steadfastness whose number increases daily by hundreds and 
thousands, in addition to the masses of people who increasingly 
support our forces, the forces of unity, democracy and 
modernization.

  [Text] A responsible military spokesman in the Defense 
Ministry has stated the following: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Truly 
God loves those who fight in his cause in battle array, as if 
they were a solid cemented structure. [Koranic verse] With deep 
faith that God supports the soldiers of right, the people, and 
the revolution and that he will grant them victory, the heroes 
in our valiant Armed Forces pursue their heroic and epic 
fighting in the battles of confrontation of all the forces of 
apostasy, rebellion, and secession led by the criminal and evil 
elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] command in the 
governorates of Lahij, Abyan, and Aden, scoring decisive 
victories in the performance of their tasks. 
  As we affirmed in a previous statement the day before 
yesterday our valiant Armed Forces in the southwestern axis 
succeeded in completely destroying all the units of the (Labuza) 
Brigade camp and have proceeded from it toward the al-'Anad camp 
where our valiant forces succeeded yesterday morning in crossing 
the fortifications of its first defensive line. Our forces 
continue to bravely and firmly engage the other defensive 
fortifications of the camp, which is considered one of the most 
important military strongholds that the elements of apostasy and 
secession in the YSP command had [word indistinct]. It contains 
defensive fortifications contributed by the Soviet experts 
during the Communist rule, as well as huge weapons arsenals, and 
an air base that was administered before 22 May 1990 by the 
Socialist bloc. Following the unity, this place remained out of 
reach for the institutions of constitutional legitimacy. No one 
knew its secrets except the members of the rebellious, 
secessionist gang and those who are close to it. 
  This gang was depending on this place to implement the most 
serious episode of its conspiracy to destroy and fragment the 
homeland. The final phase to restore this place to the Armed 
Forces and constitutional legitimacy is now under way, thanks to 
the heroes of the forces of unity and legitimacy. 
  In the Lahij Governorate axis, units from our Armed Forces 
are now working to finish their combat missions in the face of 
the forces of the secessionist gang. The units are advancing to 
achieve their objectives. 
  In the Abyan-Aden axis, our forces have also continued to 
defeat the secessionists hostile, desperate attacks advancing 
from the Aden garrison, forcing them to retreat. 
  In the face of the treacherous air attacks on the units of 
our valiant Armed forces and on defenseless cities, the heroes 
of the Air Defenses courageously confronted them. They managed 
to shoot down a fighter aircraft in al-Rahidah region and 
another in the al-Dali' area. They also shot down a third 
aircraft in [name indistinct] in the Qa'tabah District. The 
aircraft of the forces of apostasy and secession concentrated 
their attacks on the city of Ta'izz and al-Rahidah. One of 
their odious shells hit al-Rahidah Hospital, killing several 
patients in the hospital. 
  The Air Force aircraft in our valiant Armed Forces also 
conducted several offensive sorties against what was left of the 
camps and concentrations of the secessionist, rebellious forces 
in all axes of the fighting, achieving success in all their 
combat missions. They returned safely to base. 
  The forces protecting unity and upholding constitutional 
legitimacy and democracy received a number of troops, including 
commanders, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers, who were 
misled by the secessionist elements. They joined the ranks of 
right and unity, and the trench of the state and its 
constitutional institutions, expressing their loyalty to God, 
the homeland, the revolution, and the unity and rejecting the 
orders of the separatist clique. They stressed their readiness 
to continue fighting along side their colleagues in the Armed 
Forces in defense of unity and the constitutional legitimacy in 
order to defeat the remaining dens of the mutinous secessionist 
clique. 
  Large quantities of weapons, ammunition, combat equipment, 
and vehicles were seized. Information also clarified that the 
rebel separatist forces are forcing citizens, including young 
people, to join their ranks after all their threats and calls to 
the citizens to respond to the illegitimate general mobilization 
decision issued by the deposed Haytham Qasim Salih. This is 
taking place while the morale and the feelings of confidence in 
victory are increasing within the ranks of the units fighting in 
support of the unity and constitutional legitimacy and in 
defense of democracy. The citizens' hopes in all governorates 
are increasing in that those who wanted to disturb the people's 
life, fragment their unity and bargain with their fate and 
existence in the service of their own sick whims and 
illegitimate ambitions, which are hostile to the people and the 
homeland and to all the principles and values, will inevitably 
be doomed. O you who believe, if you will help the cause of 
Allah, He will help you, and plant your feet firmly. [Koranic 
verse] Issued by the Defense Ministry.

  [Text] Riyadh, May 11 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni leaders 
offered an immediate ceasefire in the civil war on Wednesday if 
their southern rivals agreed to accept President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's government, a Yemeni envoy said. 
  Salih and his followers have ousted Vice-President 'Ali 
Salim 
al- Bid and other prominent southerners from the government 
since fighting broke out last week, accusing them of wanting 
secession. 
  Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, an envoy of 
Salih, 
said that the "political leadership in Sanaa is ready to accept 
an immediate ceasefire, on condition that they (the southerners) 
respect the constitution."

<F P=106> [Report from correspondent Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi in Aden -- </F>
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] There is reaction here to the 
recent decision made in Sanaa to withdraw confidence from 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the presidential council and 
secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, and from other 
party officials and to the declaration of a 30-day state of 
emergency in the country. 
  [Al-Bid] We know from where we draw our legitimacy. Our 
legitimacy stems from our people. The legitimacy of radio and 
television that is imposed on the people is transient and can 
last only a few days. President Salih might believe that he can 
impose it for 30 days. Well, he cannot, not even for a few 
days. Trust your cause and your people, your cohesion, and 
national unity and protect every citizen without discrimination, 
no matter from what province they come. All those who are with 
the pledge and accord document, with full national cohesion, and 
with the peaceful and democratic struggle are with us, wherever 
they are born or from whatever province they hail. We have also 
issued instructions and a camp has been opened in Lahij for our 
brothers who want to join us from any province. They are 
welcome. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Like a Ripe 
Fruit"] 
  [Text] [SPIEGEL] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who comes 
from the north, blames you for the outbreak of the civil war. 
  [Al-Bid] Only an idiot would say that. Salih has been 
hatching a plot since the very beginning. His intentions were 
dishonorable. Unfortunately, we realized this too late. 
  [SPIEGEL] Were you and your Marxist colleagues in Aden not 
aware of the dangers of unification? 
  [Al-Bid] We thought that after the end of the Cold War, the 
spirit of the age would influence the responsible persons in 
Sana'a and Aden. We thought worn-out ideologies would be 
jettisoned and a common Yemeni model developed. 
  [SPIEGEL] The Muslim-conservative north is accusing the 
socialists of not having abandoned their communist stereotypes. 
  [Al-Bid] On the contrary, we in the south have permitted all 
political parties to exist. Even western diplomats are praising 
our freedom of the press and freedom of speech. 
State-controlled land and enterprises have been reprivatized, 
and the state trade monopoly has been abolished. The north has 
contributed nothing to the Yemeni marriage. On the contrary, 
the gentlemen in Sana'a, obsessed with their tribal interests 
and with gaining personal power, are trying to enforce their 
anti-progressive ideas in the south, even by means of force. 
  [SPIEGEL] And you do not want to change the North Yemenis? 
  [Al-Bid] We want to change society and modernize it, but by 
democratic means. The elections last year showed that our 
ideas, geared at a social market economy and political 
pluralism, have fallen on fertile ground even in the north. 
  [SPIEGEL] In the south, you were able to assert your leading 
position, but in the north you have gained very little. 
  [Al-Bid] In any case, the election result did not suit the 
tribal politicians and the social groups linked to them. They 
thought the oil-rich south would fall into their lap like a ripe 
fruit. What they failed to achieve with the ballot paper they 
tried to achieve with a series of political coups and military 
strength. 
  Why did I return to Aden together with all the other South 
Yemeni politicians? Because in Sana'a and all over the north, 
the murderers and Muslim terrorists who are fed by the ruling 
clique are enjoying total freedom. 
  [SPIEGEL] For your part, you have extended military service 
and equipped the south with foreign weapons. 
  [Al-Bid] Purely for the purpose of self-defense. Several 
weeks ago, the Northern Army started cutting off all supplies to 
our units in North Yemen, in order to destroy them later. The 
storming of Aden is supposed to take place without any 
resistance. 
  [SPIEGEL] Can you resist the militarily superior North? 
  [Al-Bid] We will use all the means at our disposal to 
prevent the Middle Ages from also swallowing the South.

  [Text] The Yemeni Socialist Party's [YSP] political bureau 
has welcomed the efforts of brothers and friends to stop the 
in-fighting and war ignited by the secessionist military family 
in Sanaa between the sons of the Yemeni people and their armed 
forces. It confirmed that the response to these Arab and 
international efforts and initiatives was prompted by the Yemeni 
people's interest to preserve their gains and unity, and 
safeguard their armed forces economic structures and the 
citizens' souls. It was in this respect that the YSP political 
bureau responded to the calls by the United States, French, 
Egyptian, and Algerian Governments, and expressed its hope that 
these calls and efforts would receive the support of all the 
sides concerned at a time when the battles are leading towards 
comprehensive destruction. 
  In keeping with these efforts, the militant brother, 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the YSP Central Committee, 
continued his contacts with a number of Arab presidents, 
including the Egyptian president, Muhammad Husni Mubarak, the 
Syrian president, Hafiz al-Asad, and the Libyan president, 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. He briefed them on developments in Yemen 
and the bloody battles at the various axes of fighting. He 
thanked them for their concern for Yemen and confirmed the YSP's 
compliance with any effort to reflect Yemen and the Yemeni 
people from the devastation of war and in-fighting among the 
brothers.

  [Text] The House of Representatives met today in the 
presence of the parliamentary bloc of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party. It discussed the issue of the illegitimate and 
unconstitutional moves and activities abroad by brother Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister. The conferees supported 
the issuance of a circular to all embassies and official and 
diplomatic quarters in the sisterly and friendly countries and 
the international bodies and institutions, asking them not to 
officially deal with brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, 
currently abroad, because he was not on an official mission. He 
was not entrusted to undertake such a mission by the legitimate 
and constitutional political leadership nor has this mission 
been approved by the Council of Ministers.

  [Text] Responsible political sources have expressed 
amazement at statements by the so-called source in the office of 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, [as heard] on the 
Presidential Council decision to dismiss him from office. The 
sources said that such statements come from persons who have 
lost all their legitimacy and legality. 
  The sources said: Al-'Attas has been officially indicted by 
the state's legislative bodies, led by the House of 
Representatives, which presented a recommendation for a decision 
to stop the activities of the prime minister -- who says that he 
is being treated in the United States -- activities aimed to 
serve the views of the rebels in the international arena. 
  The sources denied that the decision to dismiss al-'Attas 
was 
a reflection of disorder or was an arbitrary move, as his office 
claimed. The decision came within the national responsibility 
which obliges the political leadership to carry out its 
constitutional duties. The sources emphasized that the war 
decision was that of the adventurist Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] secessionists, who created the crisis and continued to 
carry out various provocations for nine months. 
  On the same level, parliamentary sources have voiced 
surprise 
at statements by the secessionist YSP leadership on the 
constitution and said that it was these individuals who ignored 
the constitution and did not abide by it. They fabricated the 
crisis in order to avoid the constitution. 
  The parliamentary sources said that the House of 
Representatives has the right to withdraw its confidence in the 
government if the head of this government abides by the 
constitution. However, the House has the right to issue a 
recommendation for dismissal if the Presidential Council does 
not exercise its rights in accordance with the constitution. 
The sources added: The political leadership is responsible for 
implementing the constitution in accordance with Articles 105 
and 112 of the valid constitution. Therefore, the political 
leadership made the decision to dismiss al-'Attas and to refer 
him to interrogation. The sources noted that the decision does 
not need the acceptance of anyone because it is supported by the 
power of the constitution and issued by the state. It is also 
in harmony with the commitment to the constitution of the 
legitimate leadership and its care for national interests. 
  It is worth mentioning that al-'Attas was one of the leading 
secessionist elements in the YSP and played a serious role in 
continuing the crisis and igniting the fire of war by his 
conduct, which was hostile to the unity state, and his following 
al-Bid, the leader of the rebellion, in their moves to escalate 
the crisis politically and militarily. Al-'Attas then fled from 
the battlefield with all the money he could gather, leaving the 
remaining rebellion leaders to face their fate alone.

  [Excerpt] Riyadh, 10 May, KUNA -- Shaykh 'Abdallah 
al-Ahmar, the speaker of the Yemeni Parliament has said that he 
is visiting Riyadh to clarify what is happening in Yemen "within 
the framework of the solid and traditional relations between the 
two countries." 
  Shaykh al-Ahmar, who arrived in Riyadh tonight, told KUNA: 
"We have not come to look for mediation." In reply to a 
question whether he was hoping for a Saudi role to solve the 
Yemeni crisis, Shaykh al-Ahmar said: "The Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia strives to do good deeds always and everywhere." 
  Shaykh al-Ahmar, who is accompanied by the planning 
minister, 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, is carrying a message for King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of the two holy mosques, from the 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, on "the developments of 
the situation in Yemen and issues of mutual interest." 
  Shaykh al-Ahmar has denied the existence of Arab mediation 
to 
resolve the conflict, indicating that "since he left Sanaa this 
afternoon he has not heard of any mediation." He added that 
"the conflict has been decided militarily after the northern 
troops reached Shaykh 'Uthman area, situated north of Aden." He 
further said that the southern air base of al-'Anad had been 
captured and "it was brought under control this afternoon."

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister Plenipotentiary Shahir Sayf by </F>
'Imad 'Abd-al-Tawwab; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-Tawwab] What are you telling the Yemeni 
leaders in these circumstances? 
  [Sayf] Like any other Yemeni citizen, we are calling on the 
Yemeni leaders to resort to reason and to stop the military 
operations that are harming innocent civilians. Children, 
women, and men are daily falling victim to these operations. 
Villages and numerous civilian installations are being 
destroyed. We call on them to stop this, resort to reason, sit 
at the negotiating table, talk as brothers about the 
differences, and try to reach solutions that satisfy all the 
parties, spare Yemen more fighting, try to salvage what could be 
salvaged, and avoid letting Yemen enter a dark tunnel with the 
outcome known only to God almighty. 
  ['Abd-al-Tawwab] Are you calling for a dialogue among family 
members? 
  [Sayf] The one family that could find credible solutions 
based on the Pledge and Accord Document. 
  ['Abd-al-Tawwab] What do you say about Egypt's efforts? Some 
people are now criticizing Egypt and saying that it has not 
intervened. 
  [Sayf] On the contrary, Egypt has always been the first to 
intervene to find solutions to many crises faced by the Arab 
countries. Egypt has always been first. It was first in the 
Yemeni crisis through President Husni Mubarak's envoy who 
shuttled between Sanaa and Aden in an attempt to reach a 
peaceful solution for the crisis in Yemen. Even after the 
fighting erupted, Egypt took the leading role when it called on 
the Arab League to hold an extraordinary session to try to stop 
the fighting and to call on the warring parties to resort to 
dialogue to resolve their differences. 
  ['Abd-al-Tawwab] As a Yemeni citizen living in Cairo, I am 
asking you about Egypt's efforts. There have been contacts 
between President Mubarak and Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and with Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid even after the 
fighting erupted. Do you think Egypt's stance is the correct one? 
  [Sayf] Egypt's stance has been very sound. Contacts have 
taken place between Mubarak and President Salih and Vice 
President al-Bid, even during the fighting. Egypt's role is 
needed in these times. I believe that Egypt is the leading Arab 
country. The Arab nation suffers many setbacks whenever Egypt 
and its role are absent. 
  ['Abd-al-Tawwab] In whose hands is the solution? 
  [Sayf] The solution is in the hands of the Yemenis but with 
the help of their Arab brothers. 
  ['Abd-al-Wattab] Several days ago, Egypt was the scene of 
the 
signing of the Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement and there was 
great joy for the Palestinians, some of whom are in Yemen. Do 
you think this is the right time for this Yemeni crisis, when 
the brother is killing his brother and tanks and planes are on 
the attack? 
  [Sayf] You feel real pain when you see reconciliations 
taking 
place everywhere, meetings, and the signing of agreements here 
and there, while the world is daily watching the bloody fighting 
in Yemen, which is claiming the lives of many innocent people 
who have no interest in the fighting. I hope the Arab efforts 
will be effective and that more contacts will be held with the 
Yemeni leaders to put them back on the right course. 
  ['Abd-al-Tawwab] I thank you for this interview and ask: 
What is your message through the Cairo radio network to the 
brothers in Yemeni? 
  [Sayf] I can say only this: Pray to God to guide our Yemeni 
leaders, inspire them to achieve an end to this bloody fighting, 
and make them resort to reason and hold dialogue because we can 
reach very good results through dialogue. We might not achieve 
any results through fighting. The damage could be more grave if 
the fighting continues in this way and claims more victims.

  [Text] A responsible source has stated the following: 
  The political leadership is following the sincere brotherly 
initiatives launched in the past two days by some fraternal and 
friendly states that aim to help our country overcome the 
serious and difficult circumstances. 
  We appreciate the good intentions that prompted all these 
brothers and friends to take their initiatives, and value highly 
all the efforts they exerted in the past to end the sharp crisis 
fabricated by 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the secessionist clique in 
the Socialist Party. We also want to remind them about how far 
the political leadership has gone in the past months to respond 
positively to these initiatives and good offices, and to remind 
them of the tolerance and patience it displayed and the 
concessions it made, even at the level of sacrificing certain 
election gains, hoping that the Socialist Party leadership would 
reconsider its position and abandon its intransigent positions. 
It also hoped the Socialist Party leadership would abandon its 
insistence on continuing the crisis and not allow its arrogance 
and extortionist attempts to reach the extent of plunging into 
defiance and rebellion and entrench a de facto division. 
  However, al-Bid and other members of the secessionist clique 
in the Socialist Party did not stop at that point. First, they 
started to kindle the fire of sedition among the ranks of our 
one Yemeni people. When they discovered that they failed in 
this attempt, they moved to incite fighting among the ranks of 
the Armed Forces by using some of the hardline military 
commanders who are members of the Socialist Party itself and who 
are involved with them in the scheme of secession and insurgency. 
  The sequence of the conspiracy against unity and 
constitutional legitimacy and the attempt to drive the homeland 
into the furnace of fratricide continued. The first episode was 
the futile attack against the al-'Amaliqah Forces in the Abyan 
area the day after the Pledge and Accord Document was signed in 
Amman on 10 Ramadan, corresponding to 20 February, and the start 
of fighting in (?Harf Sufyan) and Shabwah. That series reached 
its climax in the 'Imran camp, where the 3d Armored Brigade 
attacked the 1st Brigade, which was stationed alongside the 3d 
Brigade in the same camp. The result of that painful and bloody 
fighting was tragic by all standards and caused the hearts of 
all honorable people in Yemen to bleed. Large number of 
soldiers from the two brigades were either killed or wounded and 
our Armed Forces lost scores of tanks and equipment, as well as 
many valiant men. 
  Leader President Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih had 
wished that this tragic incident and major loss would be the 
last of the tragedies and calamities at this difficult and 
serious stage in the history of our great people. Instead, the 
insurgent secessionist gang controlling the Socialist Party did 
not learn from this very costly lesson. It embarked on an 
all-out war in a flagrant defiance of all requirements of 
constitutional legitimacy and in a painful and flagrant 
insurrection that runs counter to all values and traditions. 
This started by ordering the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar to 
mobilize and deploy its tanks outside its camp and inside the 
city without any justification, and to start an attack against 
the Republican Guard battalion stationed at a distance from it. 
  Brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential Council 
chairman and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, was 
distressed by the escalating situation. In a serious and 
sincere attempt to contain that serious development, which 
started at 2010 on Wednesday 4 May, he issued his decisive and 
prompt orders to immediately cease fire. He also ordered the 
commander of the Republican Guard battalion not to respond to 
fire from the Ba Suhayb Brigade, even unilaterally, regardless 
of how long the Ba Suhayb Brigade continued to open fire. 
Indeed, the Republican Guard battalion ceased fire upon the 
orders of the brother president while the Ba Suhayb Brigade 
continued to fire its bombs and rockets in all directions, even 
in the direction of the houses of defenseless families. 
  Less than an hour later, the guns and tanks of insurgency 
and 
secession in Aden started fierce attacks against the Central 
Security soldiers, who only had automatic machine guns as 
weapons. Meanwhile, military elements from the gang of 
insurgency and secession stationed in al-'Anad, Lahij 
Governorate, started a fierce and ceaseless attack against the 
2d Brigade, which is stationed in (?Rassal). 
  With these escalating, serious developments, the political 
leadership found itself facing a flagrant mutiny, a clear 
military coup d'etat attempt, and a state of a comprehensive 
aggression. It had to confront that handful of conspirators and 
mutineers after things reached a climax. 
  The people, with all their honorable factions and national 
forces, particularly their valiant Armed Forces which abides by 
the constitutional legitimacy, are confronting the mutineers who 
deviated from the national and popular consensus. The political 
leadership is assuming its responsibilities and powers to 
protect law and order, unity, and democracy in all parts of the 
one and united Yemeni homeland. 
  In the light of what we mentioned before, it is very clear 
that what is going on in Yemen is, beyond any doubt, not a civil 
war or a struggle between two powers or the south and north, but 
an operation carried out by a rebellious outlaw group that 
refuses to come under the canopy of constitutional legitimacy 
and seeks to fragment the homeland and unity, abort unity and 
democracy, and return to the time of division and authoritarian 
role and the time of pre-22 May 1990. This is a battle we have 
no choice but to fight. It was dictated on us by those who took 
terrorism and violence as a profession and who have exercised 
suppression, plunder, and the violation of all human rights 
throughout their long criminal history, and those who were 
intoxicated by devious Communist ideology. 
  It must be clear that any solution that returns the homeland 
to the time of fragmentation and authoritarian role and the 
single party system is out of question. All fraternal states 
must realize that the matter is not a struggle between parties 
over power, but a struggle between the entire people and the 
elements of insurgency and division who violate law and order. 
  There is a type of man whose speech about this world's life 
may dazzle thee and he calls God to witness about what is in his 
heart, yet is he the most contentious of enemies. [Koranic 
verse]

  [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister Muhammad Salih 
Basindwah stated that the Arab League's emergency meeting to 
discuss sending Arab forces to disengage Yemen's combatants is 
unjustified, noting that Yemen's situation is an internal affair 
and not a conflict between two separate states. 
  In an interview with the BBC today, he said limited fighting 
is now taking place in Abyan and Lahij provinces between the 
government forces and what he termed as a group of the 
separatist forces. 
  He said Scud missiles had been used against Sanaa and other 
cities in the north and that aircraft from the south had raided 
the capital Sanaa. He added that of the aircraft that had 
raided the capital and other cities ten were shot down. 
  He said the decision to dismiss Yemeni Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid was permitted by the constitution, which empowers 
the State Council to make such decisions.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid telephoned Foreign Minister Ahmad Salim 
Basindwah to inform him of the resolution passed earlier today 
by an Arab League extraordinary session on Yemen. 
  Tal'at Hamid, press adviser to the Arab League secretary 
general, has stated that Basindwah pointed out that Yemen 
welcomes the Arab League's resolution. Basindwah voiced Yemen's 
readiness to receive a delegation from the Arab League's General 
Secretariat and to adopt the necessary measures as soon as 
possible to secure the arrival of the delegation in Sanaa. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid has formed a high-level delegation from 
the 
League's Secretariat led by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, 
assistant secretary general for military affairs, and assigned 
it to exert efforts to stop the fighting there, but the closure 
of the Sanaa airport precluded the arrival of the delegation. 
  During the telephone conversation, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid 
underscored the interest of all member states to end the 
fighting and find an appropriate settlement of the Yemeni crisis 
that could ensure the unity, security, and stability of Yemen.

has denied radio and news agency reports that an Arab League

discuss an internal Yemeni affair, viewing such a meeting as a 
serious precedent that could extend to other Arab countries in 
the future. The brother foreign minister emphasized that what 
is taking place in Yemen is just a confrontation by the 
legitimate authorities of a rebel group that has deviated from 
constitutional legitimacy.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, member of the </F>
Political Bureau of the General People's Congress, by Salwa 
al-Ustuwani in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Text] 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, member of the General 
Committee (Political Bureau) of the General People's Congress 
[GPC] and head of its General Department, has announced that the 
Sanaa government and people reject any Arab military 
intervention, and called on the Arab states to stop their media 
vituperation. 
  Yemen, he said, will solve its own problems and the battles 
will settle the situation. The Yemeni official arrived in 
Damascus two days ago to meet with Yemeni leaders and figures 
and with Syrian officials to explain the explosive situation in 
his country and convey his party's views on the situation. 
  Al-'Ansi said he did not believe that the unity [of Yemen] 
was at an end because "unity is the fate and destiny of the 
Yemeni people. That is what we will fight for." He added that 
intervention by Arab forces would mean promotion of secession. 
Our unity, he said, is not a unity between two peoples to 
warrant comparison with the Syrian-Egyptian unity. Yemen has 
been united since the beginning of time. 
  He also said: "We do not want to be carried away with the 
Western and Arab media which are now claiming that there is 
civil war. That is a misconception. What is taking place in 
Yemen is not civil war. A civil war is a war between members of 
the public or between tribes, sects, or parties." 
  What is going on, he emphasized, is fighting between armed 
forces upholding constitutional legitimacy and forces rebelling 
against legitimacy "and we consider that to be military mutiny 
which must be destroyed by military means." 
  Then, speaking tactically, he said that "the civil war 
description applies to some southern governorates where there is 
a conflict in the governorates of Abyan, Shabwah, Hadramaut, 
Lahij, and Aden between the people there, between those 
supporting the unity line and the renegade secessionist forces 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]." 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Would you bet on anyone in the south? 
  [Al-'Ansi] Yes, we bet on the unionist forces within the YSP 
and we bank on them to settle the issue and to rebel against the 
leadership which we do not consider to be legitimate. In Yemen, 
the army which is fighting the renegade and secessionist forces 
is being described by news agencies and the media as the 
northern army. It is not the northern army. It is the army of 
unity and it includes people from the south and the north. The 
opposing forces, which they describe as southern, include 
elements from the north and the south. 
  The north's big wager is on the unionist forces in Aden and 
in the armed forces. Currently there are reports that Muhammad 
'Ali Ahmad and large groups loyal to former southern President 
'Ali Nasir Muhammad are beginning to respond to YSP appeals and 
take up arms inside Aden. Battles are raging in Lahij, Radfan, 
al-Dali', Mukayris, and Abyan. There is a conflict between the 
unionists and the secessionists. But there is no fighting in 
Ibb, Ta'izz, or Sanaa. There is no fighting between the people 
nor between one force and another there. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] What, in your view, is the solution? 
  [Al-'Ansi] It is to uphold the constitution, the will of the 
people, and constitutional legitimacy. What is now being said 
about Arab mediation is a thing of the past and no longer valid. 
If, in a calm atmosphere, the mediations in Amman and Salalah 
failed, what would happen against a background of military 
conflict? 
  I urge the Arab states to refrain from mediation because 
they 
only want to take positions in the media. There are more of 
such states but they know that it would be futile to intervene 
because when guns speak, reason disappears. I urge the states 
now initiating mediations to look for something else to do. We 
Yemenis are sensitive people. Above all, we say to those who 
want to exploit the current war by internationalizing the issue 
or by sending Arab forces, or anything else, we say frankly 
that, throughout history, Yemen has been the graveyard of 
invaders. That is why we reject intervention. 
  What scares us about this talk of sending forces and of 
mediation is that they are talking about Egyptian mediation and 
dispatch of forces to disengage the warring parties. That is a 
thing of the past. The Egyptians raised it two weeks ago and a 
month ago but we rejected it because the presence of forces 
would mean partition and revival of the secession. We tell 
them: Play another game, for that is out of the question as far 
as we are concerned. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] So, in your view, what is the alternative 
solution? 
  [Al-'Ansi] They should leave us alone and let us act and 
solve our own problems by military or political means. They 
would then have a clear conscience. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Do you believe that the solution lies in the 
disappearance of the current leaderships? 
  [Al-'Ansi] Why disappearance of the leaderships? The 
solution hs been spelled out in the House of Representatives. 
It used the legitimate card and dismissed 'Ali Salim al-Bid and 
Salim Salih Muhammad from their posts in the state as 
Presidential Council members. That is a part of the solution. 
  As far as the north is concerned we have invoked 
constitutional legitimacy and the people's will. 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih is there by popular demand. When the people tell 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid to go then he must go. But for him to impose a 
rule of fire and the sword on the people, exploit the crisis, 
and, against a background of mediation, sidestep the results we 
have achieved for our people, that is totally rejected. It is 
not a personal matter between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. I am not revealing a secret when I say that some 
members of the Yemeni House of Representatives have proposed two 
names for membership of the Presidential Council to replace 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid and Salim Salih Muhammad. They are (former 
southern President) 'Ali Nasir Muhammad and 'Abd-al-Qawi 
Makkawi. These are two patriotic figures with a formidable 
struggle record, respected by the Yemeni people. (It is well 
known that the Presidential Council consists of five members who 
are: 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and Salim Salih 
Muhammad). 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Do you believe that the pledge and accord 
document could still be implemented or should a new document or 
a new solution be considered? 
  [Al-'Ansi] The document is still suitable as far as we are 
concerned but the mechanism must change. Once 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
and Salim Salih Muhammad are out and are replaced in the 
Presidential Council by others, matters begin to crystallize and 
solutions to be implemented. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] So you are against the war decision? 
  [Al-'Ansi] Nobody wants war. It was "force majeure." Our 
war was limited and the military eruptions and escalations were 
on a limited scale, but when this war started three days ago our 
forces were hit in Abyan, the central security units in Aden 
were besieged and hit, and the power station in Dhummar was 
suddenly hit to disrupt the power supply to Sanaa, and the camps 
in Dhummar were hit. It was premeditated aggression. The 
Yemeni Army (northern) could not possibly remain idle. The war 
was imposed on us and we are fighting it in defense of 
legitimacy and to strike at the centers of mutiny. 
  I wish to stress that in many of the current battles, the 
main parties involved are not northern and southern forces but 
forces of mutiny and popular forces now fighting and resisting 
the rebels in the southern governorates. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] According to some reports, the northern 
forces have reached the outskirts of Aden. Do you believe it is 
possible to take control of Aden? 
  [Al-'Ansi] God willing, the situation will certainly be 
decided and control will be gained, and the brothers will lay 
down their arms. If they want destruction for their country, 
then they should continue their aggression but we ask them to 
lay down their arms and to stop the war. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] What is the purpose of besieging Aden? 
  [Al-'Ansi] To bring them down, arrest them, and refer them 
to trial because they are the ones who triggered the war. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Are the north Yemeni forces fighting fit, 
enough to settle the situation in Aden? 
  [Al-'Ansi] It is not just a question of fitness. We are 
fighting for what is right and we are the stronger in that 
respect. We are fighting for a cause. I am optimistic that 
Aden will be brought under control very soon, not because we are 
the stronger in authority and in the Army but because the people 
are against mutiny and secession. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] If Aden is brought under control, what would 
be the steps to follow? 
  [Al-'Ansi] (Defense Minister) Haytham Qasim will be referred 
to trial according to the Presidential Council's decision, 
because he is to blame for the war. Those responsible for the 
Dhummar and 'Imran massacres will also be referred to trial. 
Regarding the other brothers in the south, the people have 
dismissed them from the leadership, but 'Ali Salim al-Bid cannot 
be dismissed from the post of party secretary general. What is 
important is that the party should be a party in the full sense 
of the word, without militia, without forces, and without an 
iron fist. There should be a peaceful assumption of authority. 
That is what we and the Yemeni people want.

  [Text] An official media spokesman has expressed surprise 
at some of the foreign media coverage of current developments in 
Yemen, which he said used inexact phrases that do not fit the 
new political and geographical reality in the united Yemen. 
These media organizations, he said, speak of a conflict between 
north and south and northern and southern forces, while, in 
reality, there is a single state and a single constitutional 
legitimacy. The military operations in some governorates of the 
Republic of Yemen are not pitting two systems of government or 
two states against each other. They are confrontations between 
the regular forces of the united government of Yemen and 
secessionist rebels defying legitimacy and law and order. 
  The spokesman said he regretted that certain Arab media are 
making the same mistake, using the same phrases that reflect the 
former state of division, which existed before 22 May 1990, 
after which date Yemen was reunified and the Republic of Yemen 
proclaimed. The spokesman hoped the media, particularly the 
Arab, would be more accurate and observe the official 
designations.

  [Text] The leadership of federal Russia has called on the 
two sides fighting in Yemen to immediately halt all military 
operations. It said in a statement issued by the Foreign 
Ministry that whatever the differences between the disputing 
parties and whatever ends they had in mind could not constitute 
a justification for bloodshed and fratricidal strife or the 
suffering of the Yemeni people, nor justify the destruction of 
what is new.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Sons of Yemen League and Unionist </F>
Grouping: Appeal To Stop 'Dirty War'"] 
  [Text] Aden, AL-HAYAH -- The Sons of Yemen League and the 
Yemeni Unionist Grouping have appealed to Arab kings and 
leaders, Muslim scholars and wise men, and leaders of the new 
world order, urging them to "intervene by exerting pressure and 
influence and using mutual ties to halt the Yemeni war." The 
league called for the severing of political and economic 
relations with the Yemeni leaders if they do not respond to the 
appeals to stop the fighting. It said that they are "pursuing 
only their personal interests." 
  A statement issued from Aden yesterday by the league's 
leader, 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Ja'fari; its secretary general, Muhsin 
Bin-Farid; and the Unionist Grouping's secretary general, 'Umar 
al-Jawi, said that what is happening in Yemen now is "the result 
of the way in which the country is being run. Here are the 
country's leaders destroying it, its Army, and its people." 
They described what is happening as a "catastrophe." It said 
that the Yemeni leaders are acting "as though they are the 
enemies of the country and its people." 
  The statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, added: 
"We know that our position could expose us and our party to 
danger. But we do not care about what could afflict us. We are 
interested in our country and our people, because we know we are 
worth nothing without a secure homeland. We also know that what 
the gangs' leaders are doing will not spare a country or a 
people, because their only concern is their own interests.... 
They are firing their missiles and dropping their bombs 
everywhere, no matter who is killed or what is destroyed." 
  The statement said that the Yemeni Army "is destroying 
itself, while the leaders continue to destroy their country's 
infrastructure. We doubt whether some of them feel they belong 
to this country or to our religion, Islam, or have any human 
feelings." 
  The statement urged "that this dirty war be stopped and 
innocent citizens rescued. If the leaders refuse to stop this 
war, we urge you to sever your political and economic relations 
with them and help our people to surmount the catastrophe being 
inflicted by these leaders who are taking the country into the 
unknown." 
  The statement issued by the league and the grouping went on: 
"In the name of God, brotherhood, and humanity, we appeal to you 
to move swiftly before it is too late. Because it is in no 
one's interests for our citizens to continue to be killed and 
our country destroyed.... If the country's leaders lose their 
mind, someone must stand by the people, who are suffering terror 
and starvation." 
  The statement urged the Army to stop the fighting and not to 
respond to any orders to launch attacks.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Abdallah al-Hadrami, director </F>
general of the Yemeni Economic Corporation, by 'Abd-al-Malik 
al-'Ayzari--live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Hadrami] Thank you very much for giving me this 
opportunity. I would just like to reassure the brother citizens 
that the basic foodstuffs are available. Ships are arriving at 
the ports with all kinds of foodstuffs including rice, sugar, 
flour, wheat, milk, and other things. These are being 
distributed all over the republic. 
  As for our corporation, its branches are fully open to our 
citizens so that they may obtain their needs easily and at 
official prices. If there are difficulties in receiving any 
commodity in areas where there are no branches of the 
corporation, the latter loads trucks and sells these materials 
directly from the trucks. Let the people be reassured. The 
corporation's branches contain all the basic commodities. The 
corporation is at the service of all and during all 
circumstances. 
  [Al-'Azari] Thank you, brother 'Abdallah. Would you like to 
offer any advice in this regard? 
  [Al-Hadrami] I just want to reassure the citizens and tell 
them that the country is in good shape and Yemen is proceeding 
from one victory to another. The available foodstuffs, whether 
in the stores or on the road to the stores or arriving at ports 
are sufficient. There are no shortages or disorders in supplies. 
The greedy merchants will be made to account for their actions. 
The Supply and Trade Ministry has already warned them. 
Citizens should cooperate with the state in this regard and 
must report all those who tamper with the prices and those who 
exploit the situation and hoard foodstuffs. 
  [Al-'Ayzari] This means there is no shortage of any basic 
foodstuff? 
  [Al-Hadrami] No, everything is available. The strategic 
reserves are there and the ships are arriving, and the branches 
are full. Everything is available.

  [Text] Amman, May 8 (AFP) -- A nightly curfew has been 
imposed on the Yemeni capital Sanaa which is also facing severe 
fuel shortages, an evacuee who fled the city told AFP here. 
  The evacuee, who refused to be identified, said long queues 
form daily at petrol stations and the public transport system 
had been virtually brought to a standstill. 
  The curfew begins nightly at 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m, after 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared a state of emergency 
Thursday. 
  At night anti-aircraft salvos light up the sky searching out 
attacking southern planes, which have launched several air raids 
on the city, the Arab national said after landing on an 
evacuation flight in Jordan. 
  He added that a total news black-out had been imposed since 
fighting broke out four days ago between rival army forces, and 
amid reports that southern troops had fired Scud missiles at the 
capital. 
  He was not able to say whether there were any victims. 
  So far there has been no official casualty toll in the 
fighting which erupted Thursday, but an Islamic party supporting 
the president said Saturday 150 had died. 
  The evacuee was among 170 people, mainly UN personnel, flown 
out of Sanaa Sunday to Amman on a special flight. 
  Hundreds of foreigners have fled the war which has pitted 
Salih against his southern rival Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid.

<F P=106> [Interview with former President of South Yemen 'Ali Nasir </F>
Muhammad, in Damascus, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo; date 
not given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] Do you have a new initiative to 
resolve the Yemeni crisis now that the situation has become 
dangerously complicated? 
  [Muhammad] I am against the dialogue of rifles, tanks, 
aircraft, guns, and rockets. I support the fraternal and 
peaceful dialogue that could lead to a solution and possibly to 
a relaxation in the Yemeni situation. I made some proposals and 
stated some ideas to contain the crisis in Yemen last year and 
this year. I made my latest proposals one month ago. 
Regrettably, this initiative and these sincere and honest 
efforts collided with some irresponsible stances. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Who do you mean? 
  [Muhammad] I cannot say now who is responsible. But it was 
not only my initiative that was rejected, but also other Arab 
and international initiatives that could have contained the 
crisis in Yemen had there been a positive response to them. 
Battles are raging today and everyone will be harmed by these 
battles in which every weapon of destruction -- naval, land, air 
weapons, and Scud missiles -- is used. The winner in these 
battles is a loser. This is why I say that returning to 
understanding and dialogue in Yemen is the only way to solve the 
country's crisis. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Who is responsible for making the situation in 
Yemen so grave? 
  [Muhammad] Everyone is responsible for the eruption of the 
fighting and for the Yemeni people's tragedy. We are not 
discussing who fired the first bullet or who caused the crisis 
to erupt. We are discussing the consequences of this mad and 
destructive war that could damage the Yemeni people's gains, 
security, stability, and also the stability of the region. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Now that the situation has erupted in this 
way, 
what, in your view, as a son of Yemen and as an observer who is 
remote from events, is the means of stopping this bloodshed? 
Can you specify? 
  [Muhammad] I first call for halting the bloodshed in Yemen 
and urge caring about Yemen's unity. I reject secession and the 
fighting in Yemen and advocate a return to the dialogue that 
could contain the crisis. Some people might ask with whom can 
we have a dialogue today. I tell them that we can search for 
the parties that might reach an understanding and solve the 
crisis. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Who are these parties? 
  [Muhammad] I do not want to name names but it is known that 
there are three parties in the ruling coalition. There is also 
the dialogue committee that comprises the political forces in 
Yemen. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] But this committee has achieved nothing. It 
was the one that drew up the Pledge and Accord Document but 
failed to achieve the required result. How can it achieve 
anything now when battles are raging? 
  [Muhammad] I agree with you that the committee achieved the 
Pledge and Accord Document. But the committee has played no 
role in implementing this document. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Was this the fault of the committee or of the 
parties to the current conflict? 
  [Muhammad] I believe the coalition committee is not 
responsible for the nonimplementation, because the three ruling 
parties are the decisionmakers in Yemen. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Are you prepared to visit Yemen and work out 
a new solution? 
  [Muhammad] I am quite prepared to visit Yemen and help the 
leadership find a solution if this would serve the public 
interest and the supreme interest of the Yemeni people. I am 
also prepared to offer sacrifices for the sake of the Yemeni 
people. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Do you think the current situation in Yemen 
dictates that you should visit Yemen now? 
  [Muhammad] The situation dictates that all the good people, 
whether Yemenis, Arab brothers, or friends, should be there now. 
I believe that every concerted effort must be made to enable 
Yemen to ride out its crisis and ordeal and end the bloodshed 
and destruction. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Are you prepared to coordinate positions with 
some Arab sides, like Egypt and the United Arab Emirates [UAE] 
or others, to take a new initiative to end the situation? 
  [Muhammad] Personally, I am ready to carry out any effort, 
whether with my brothers in Egypt or the UAE, any effort that is 
bound to contain the crisis and solve the problem in Yemen. I 
am also ready to coordinate efforts on the Arab and 
international levels to resolve the crisis in Yemen. But what 
matters is that the political leadership there should respond to 
such initiatives, because many initiatives taken by our brothers 
and friends did not succeed in view of the various stances. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Some people say that Arab forces should be 
sent 
there to disengage the two warring sides. But the political 
leadership in Sanaa said that this is an internal dispute and 
does not necessitate this. 
  [Muhammad] This proposal has [words indistinct] the views of 
the political leadership in Yemen. I previously stressed the 
need for Arab efforts and welcomed the initiative taken by Egypt 
and the UAE. I also welcomed the initiative carried out by the 
Arab League secretary general to send a committee to Yemen to 
follow up the developments there and help work out a solution. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Do you think that unity could survive amid 
such 
circumstances? 
  [Muhammad] The current events in Yemen will cause a deep 
wound in the body of Yemeni unity and in the heart of the Yemeni 
people, even the Arab people. This is because the unity does 
not only concern the Yemeni people; it concerns the entire Arab 
nation as well. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Some people say the unity was founded on the 
wrong basis, because the military, economic, and political 
institutions did not unite. Do you concur? 
  [Muhammad] I would like to say that the unity [word 
indistinct] for the Yemeni people. But Yemen experienced 
difficulties, problems, and crises in the absence of unity. 
That is why the Yemeni leadership sought unity to avoid all 
these crises. But various attempts were carried out to avoid 
unity. I support every effort made to solve the problems that 
cropped up in the absence of unity. You cannot solve problems 
by avoiding unity. The [words indistinct] and accord summed up 
the crisis in Yemen and defined the solutions to the crisis. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Thank you, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former 
president of south Yemen. 
  [Muhammad] Many thanks to the Voice of the Arabs, the voice 
of the Arab nation.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Since the famous seclusion of the most famous 
recluse in history [reference to 'Ali Salim al-Bid's withdrawal 
from Sanaa to Aden in August, 1993], our country has gone 
through the worst crisis in its history. All nationalist forces 
in the Yemeni arena, above all the General People's Congress 
[GPC], have explored every avenues to resolve the crisis. 
Toward that end, and in the interest of the country's unity, 
the GPC offered a series of concessions. In contrast, the other 
side has given its party's interests precedence over all other 
interests. 
  However, the good faith inherent in these concessions was 
not 
enough to reassure the spiteful gang in the Yemeni Socialist 
Party as to its standing in a united, democratic, and 
pluralistic society. This is because, by virtue of its black 
and bloody history and its awareness of the manner in which the 
people regard the crimes it has committed against the country's 
worthy and struggler sons, it knew that it was bound to lose out 
and that the relapse into disunity was the only way for it to 
return to the iron-fisted rule that had ended with the 
proclamation of the blessed unity on 22 May, 1990. 
  We had thought, along with all the worthy unionists on this 
good land, that 27 April -- the day of democracy -- would put a 
definitive end to the claims and absurd conditions that the 
separatist elements within the Socialist Party used to buy time 
before the right circumstances arrived for putting their 
secessionist blueprint into practice. 
  The 27 April democracy introduced a new climate symbolizing 
a 
victory of the popular option of constitutional legitimacy. 
However, seeing that this new climate would frustrate their 
criminal scheme, the officials holding sway in the Socialist 
Party tried to think up new pretexts in a desparate attempt to 
create other conditions, at odds with constitutional legitimacy 
but suiting their separatist bent. 
  Using its extortionist and exploitative approach to the 
pro-unity forces, the party extracted a fresh string of 
concessions that had no basis in legitimacy. When the 
secessionist gang found its plan had no chance other than 
through war, it sparked off hostilities without the least regard 
for national interests. 
  At this critical moment in our history, the question arises 
as to whether this gang within the party will achieve its 
secession through the war it ignited. If the military situation 
as it stands is any guide, then unity is here to say. The 
Republic of Yemen's Armed Forces, with all its corps, are 
standing shoulder to shoulder, poised to defend the gains most 
cherished by the people. The coming few days will unmask the 
ugly face of the gang of apostacy and secession, which is now 
harvesting all the distress it has sown in our benevolent land. 
Death to them, life to the homeland and unity.

  [Text] Dear citizens, faithful sons of our people: The 
idiots and reckless leaders of the forces of apostasy and 
secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] have ignited the 
fires of this fierce war out of their yearning for blood because 
they were raised on shedding blood. However, when your valiant 
Armed Forces, the soldiers of the homeland and the revolution, 
and the protectors of unity and legitimacy, began to confront 
them, they were the first to escape and the first to be defeated 
on the fields of honor and in the arenas of legitimate and 
sacred defense of the homeland's achievements and the crown of 
unity, which is shining over the homeland's heads in pride and 
glory. 
  Yes, the cowards of the party and shedders of blood, the 
followers of 'Ali Salim al-Bid and murderer Haytham Qasim Tahir, 
have fled. They are addicted to the smell of gunpowder and the 
sound of gunfire, and are used to fleeing and retreating in 
front of the good forces, the protectors of our homeland, and 
its valiant heroes in the heroic Armed Forces and in its 
brigades, which are deployed all over the beloved homeland to 
protect the most precious achievements of the homeland and to 
give to the constitutional legitimacy and the Yemeni masses' 
options the right to survival, steadfastness, and existence. 
  Since the evil gang in the YSP and the clique of apostasy 
and 
partition is entirely wrong, the sons of our Armed Forces have 
not relented and will never relent to confront this gang's evil 
schemes. Here are the troops of our one army, which this gang 
sought to throw into a losing battle against the legitimacy, are 
joining the ranks of this legitimacy one group after another in 
order to join the ranks of right and the trenches of the sacred 
duty of defending the achievements of the people against the 
plans that are backed by filthy money to sabotage and destroy 
the homeland.

  [Text] O beloved ones in dear Aden, O beloved ones in 
steadfast Abyan, O beloved ones in glorious Shabwah, O beloved 
ones in all governorates of the cherished Republic of Yemen, O 
brothers and beloved ones in this good land: The gang of 
apostasy and secession has long made you taste the bitterness of 
all types of woes and agony. This criminal rebelling gang, 
which has abandoned all noble values and honorable manners, has 
been spitting out the venom of its hidden grudge into the body 
of the one Yemen for over two and a half decades. Today, and at 
this decisive moment in the history of our people, it is pouring 
the fire of its grudge onto the populated cities, thinking that 
it will frighten the people and scare the army of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy, which is advancing toward it like a 
surging sea. 
  O honorable compatriots in the southern and eastern 
governorates: Your sons and brothers in the army of unity and 
democracy and constitutional legitimacy are scoring one victory 
after another. They are continuing their march toward the dens 
of this renegade gang. Help them achieve the missions you 
entrusted to them--the mission of cutting off the fingers that 
seek to disrupt the unity of Yemen, both land and man. It is 
for the sake of this unity that fathers and forefathers have 
struggled and sacrificed. It is the unity for which pure blood 
was spilled and chaste souls were offered. It is unity which 
restored the smile to all on 22 May 1990 and over which all 
hearts rejoiced. It is unity which we will protect with our 
souls and the pupils of our eyes. The forces of evil and 
apostasy will not be able to undermine the sacredness of our 
cherished unity for they are too weak to even harm the hair on a 
camel's back.

feature] 
  [Text] While the forces of unity and democracy pursue their 
military operations against the units following the orders of 
the forces of apostasy and secession within the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP], which have rebelled against the constitutional 
legitimacy, more officers and soldiers who have been misled 
continue to join the ranks of their brothers in the brigades 
defending unity and constitutional legitimacy. 
  Citizens in all governorates of the republic were happy to 
meet the officers and soldiers who joined the forces of 
legitimacy, as well as those who have given themselves up to 
these forces, which are heroically and faithfully waging the 
battles of honor to protect unity and defend constitutional 
legitimacy. 
  It goes without saying that the sons of our people are 
confident and certain that the end of the gang of apostasy and 
secession is close. While we say this, we expect the citizens 
in Aden not only to help the forces of unity, which are on the 
verge of entering Aden, but to prevent the gang of apostasy and 
secession from escaping and to arrest it so that it will receive 
the punishment it deserves. 
  We urge the citizens in Aden to arrest the gang of apostasy 
and secession, which has sowed corruption and exterminated 
defenseless people and from whose repression and injustice 
thousands have suffered over many decades, because we are 
confident that the inhabitants of Aden yearn for salvation from 
those who have transformed their lives into an inferno of 
misery, forcing the people into deprivation and poverty. We do 
not doubt for one moment that the unionists within the YSP, who 
have experienced persecution and oppression at the hands of a 
handful whose code of conduct consists of physical liquidation 
of those who protest or criticize, will also seriously 
participate in pursuing the gang of apostasy and corruption, and 
will exert the utmost effort to arrest them, given that this is 
a national duty dictated by genuine citizenship, and the 
affiliation to the Arab and Muslim Yemeni people who are 
committed to unity and democracy, and whose sons are bound 
together by the strongest bonds since early history. 
  We thank God for the successes of the Armed Forces defending 
unity and we wish them success in their military operations to 
bring down the strongholds of the units taking orders from the 
gang of apostasy and secession. We also express appreciation to 
the officers and soldiers who continue to join the ranks of 
their brothers who defend unity and constitutional legitimacy 
for their concern to stand where the people want them to stand. 
National duty dictates that they carry arms for the sake of 
unity, to protect democracy, and impose the respect of 
constitutional legitimacy. 
  All the citizens in Aden, whose outskirts have been reached 
by the forces defending unity and constitutional legitimacy, are 
dutybound to prevent the escape of the gang of apostasy and 
secession, which has rebelled against constitutional legitimacy 
and which has ignited an all-out war to drown the sons of the 
one homeland in blood and to sow destruction and death in all 
its parts. But God has frustrated their hopes. This gang has 
only a few hours left before it faces the shameful fate it 
deserves.

  [Text] A plenary session was held yesterday at the 
headquarters of the General Federation of Trade Unions of the 
Republic held by the public trade unions and the labor council 
in the province of Aden under the chairmanship of brother Ghazi 
Salih Mahdi, chairman of the General Federation of the 
republic's trade unions. It was devoted to consider the 
developments witnessed by our country as a result of the civil 
war the drums of which were beaten by the Al- Ahmar military 
separatist bloody gang with the aim of destroying the homeland, 
aborting the democratic options, and killing the pledge and 
accord document. 
  The meeting decided to set up three working committees to 
face up to the consequences of this all out and destructive war. 
They were the civil defense committee, the general mobilization 
committee, and the supplies and services committee. The meeting 
also decided to call on the workers to [words indistinct] donate 
blood to save the life of the wounded who were subjected to the 
inhuman bombardment and call on all personnel working in the 
labor and production administrations to donate one day's wages 
to save [words indistinct] as a result of the inhuman 
bombardment by the al-Ahmar separatist clan. 
  At the end of the meeting a communique was released 
expressing deep concern at this destructive civil war which was 
declared and carried out by the murderer 'Ali Abdallah Salih, 
the leader of the hirelings and traitors, against the Yemeni 
people, against unity, democracy and against the pledge and 
accord document. The communique stressed that this war which 
was declared by the tyrants destroys everything, and kills 
children, women, old people and men. [Words indistinct] the 
Yemeni people supported the pledge and accord document and 
stressed the building of the modern Yemeni state which is 
rejected by the al-Ahmar clan. 
  The statement called on all Yemen's workers to defend their 
lives and honor and rally around the forces of unity and the 
[pledge and acccord] document which fight with fierceness for a 
unified democratic Yemen which is developed and founded on 
justice, equal citizenship, and the building of the state of 
order, law, security, and stability. 
  The General Federation of Trade Unions hailed the forces of 
unity and democracy in all battlefronts and their defiance of 
death in defense of freedom and [word indistinct] and in defense 
of land and property and their heroic resistance to the treason 
of the bloody gangs of al-Ahmar. The Federation called on the 
soldiers, officers and NCO's who are lured by this lying and 
tyrant clan to stop fighting their brothers' stance and common 
interests, to reject the orders of this clan, and to join the 
people's ranks and their brothers fighting for [word indistinct] 
and salvation to get rid of the tyrant armies and point their 
weapons toward [word indistinct] the gang of al-Ahmar. 
  The Federation called on the Arab and international 
communities and the international organizations dealing with 
human rights to intervene immediately to stop the bloodshed, 
give a helping hand to the victims, and save the Yemeni people 
from the inferno of the fire which was started by the al-Ahmar 
gang against all the members of the people and the homeland.

<F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at the World Islamic </F>
Popular Command in Tripoli on 7 May--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God: First, I welcome you warmly 
in your country, among your kinfolk, given that Islamic homes 
are homes for all Muslims. [passage omitted] 
  We know that the reason behind the founding of the World 
Islamic Popular Command [WIPC] is the bad situation of the 
Islamic nation due to the infringements of the enemy of this 
nation, its greed, and its interference. This command was 
established to face up to this bad situation, to try to save the 
nation from the situation in which it finds itself. The real 
reason that brought us together and made us found the WIPC was, 
in fact, what happened to Libya. This is just an example that 
justifies the correctness of our theories, the fact that the 
nation is facing danger, infringement, and aggression. [passage 
omitted] 
  Western interventions and attempts to impose negotiations 
and 
various deals are meant to secure and entrench a platform for 
the realization of the plan against the Islamic nation. The 
effort made by America, for instance, in what is called a peace 
process, ensuring the success of negotiations, removing 
obstacles between Palestinians and Israelis and the Arabs and 
Israelis do not represent American eagerness to bring about 
peace. America is not keen to save the lives of the Arabs and 
Muslims. America is keen to ensure the success of its 
imperialist scheme, and it is paving the way for this scheme by 
its interventions. We know that this is the reality. If the 
rulers of the Islamic-Arab nation are trying to fool the masses 
and tell them the lie that this is a peace process, we are not 
taken in by this lie. America is not eager for peace in the 
Middle East. Since when has America been keen about peace? 
America is the real enemy of peace. Since when has America been 
eager about the right or liberties of peoples? America is the 
real enemy of peoples, the real enemy of freedom. [passage 
omitted] 
  Against whom is America continuing to arm itself? Against 
Hungary, against Lithuania? Against which small state still 
existing? Never. America made a statement through its 
ambassador in Italy. He said: The confrontation is now finished 
with communism, and the front line was Berlin. Now starts 
confrontation with the Islamic world, so that the latter will 
have the same fate as the communist world. The front line is 
now Rome. We return to this official statement made by the 
American ambassador in Rome. This is a grave warning that will 
turn into a military, economic, and political action. America 
is the one that enabled the Jews to occupy Jerusalem and turn it 
into an eternal capital for the Jewish state. America will 
enable them--and these words are for history-- to occupy Mecca 
and Medina. It will enable them to reach the oil wells in the 
Gulf. America cannot leave the income from Mecca and Medina, 
the annual material income from the pilgrims, a large tourism 
income, thousands of billions every year, it cannot leave it for 
the Arabs, and the oil fields cannot be left for the Arabs or 
Muslims. [passage omitted] 
  We want to embarrass them, to embarrass this false diplomacy 
in the Islamic world, this submission, this shameful 
prostration. We say frankly: We are facing a Christian-Jewish 
alliance. We did not create it, they did. We just talk about 
it. They have now launched a religious war. No Arab or Islamic 
ruler in all the Islamic world would dare say that we are facing 
a religious war because they are hypocrites, showing the 
opposite of what they think. [passage omitted] 
  Regrettably, with the exception of just a few, the Arab and 
Islamic states generally are paving the way for the victory of 
the Christians and Jews over Muslims. We spoke about the reason 
that made Islamic groups resort to violence. These groups say 
they are terrorists, and they do not see terrorism with the same 
eyes as others because this term appeared in the Koran: Against 
them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, 
including steeds of war, to strike terror into the enemies of 
God and your enemies. We are applying, practicing terror. God 
said to have the strength to instill terror into all these 
enemies. What is the reason behind the Islamic groups 
practicing terrorism? We have found a justification in 
prostration, the shameful submission of the official regimes in 
the Arab and Islamic world before the enemies of the nation. 
[passage omitted] 
  I personally do not support any Islamic movement seeking 
power. The question is controlling the streets, not securing 
power. When we control the streets and mobilize the streets, 
then the veto will be in the hands of the Islamic masses in the 
streets. When the American secretary of state comes to visit 
us, we make people in the streets move. Roads will be closed 
down, airports will be shut, and no one will offer him even a 
glass of water. He will then return home ashamed. If you are 
rulers, then you would welcome him and offer him all the signs 
of honor and hospitality. [passage omitted] 
  Once, I stopped over in Paris when coming from Yugoslavia. 
[words indistinct] in Paris, and I was due to meet the French 
president. I arrived at the Elysee from the hotel where I was 
residing with difficulties because of the Jews. They tried to 
prevent me from reaching the French president. They closed all 
the streets and put up barricades. [passage omitted] 
  They sprinkled metal spikes that puncture car tires in the 
street in front of my motorcade. Have you ever seen a Muslim 
doing this to an Israeli? An Arab doing it to an Israeli? This 
has happened to me. I, myself, am a witness. They tried to 
destroy my car. There was a violent clash with the police. 
They brought a large number of police to enable me to arrive at 
the Elysee with difficulty. [passage omitted] 
  If we direct our attention to power, I am against the 
Islamic 
movements that contend with the rulers for power, because they 
would be compelled to become agents. As we said in this place 
years ago, however, we do not want power. We want the Islamic 
street. We want the Islamic street to rise. It would be wrong 
to rise in the violence that we have seen, because this is blind 
violence that, in fact, is out of place. 
  It is illogical when Egyptian Muslim terrorists fight some 
Egyptians in the street and leave 'Um Rashrash under occupation. 
It would have been more appropriate for them to liberate 'Um 
Rashrash, which separated the Arab and Islamic worlds, broke the 
back of the nation, and severed the pilgrimage route. Who can 
cross from Egypt to Jordan or from Jordan to Egypt? They have 
'Um Rashrash, which the Israelis call Eilat, in front of them. 
The Egyptian jihad should be directed toward liberating 'Um 
Rashrash and not for killing innocent people. What happened 
when they killed the speaker of the Egyptian People's Assembly? 
A new People's Assembly speaker was elected. When they killed 
the president of Egypt himself, another president was elected. 
[passage omitted] 
  In fact, this is a blind orientation. We only benefit from 
it to express anger in the Islamic street against the surrender 
of the official Islamic regime before the crusaders and against 
abandoning the nation. This is the only benefit from it. This 
is a suicidal act that brings no results. It is a suicidal act 
that is similar to a person who protests against something and 
openly sets fire to himself in the street in front of the 
people, throws himself from a high place, throws himself in the 
sea, or shoots himself to publicize his protest against 
something. I have done this in protest against so-and-so issue, 
as Buddhists and Hindus do. We interpret this in the following 
way: It is a suicidal act that leads to no results, because the 
person who commits suicide would be the only person to commit 
suicide. 
  This is a suicide attack, expressing dissatisfaction with 
what is going on. Islam would never succeed with the suicide 
attacks we witness in Egypt and Algeria. These would not lead 
to the success of Islam and will not awaken the Muslim nation. 
On the contrary, these suicide attacks will lead to sedition, 
civil war, and to the fall of Islam and national unity. Islam 
itself will be finished. Not all the people who would like to 
embrace Islam would like to embrace terrorism at the same time. 
The vast majority embrace Islam because it is Islam. 
  If embracing Islam becomes linked to the bomb, the gun, and 
underground action, people will turn away from Islam. It is a 
serious matter. Islam is becoming associated with suicide. It 
is either: You join me within this suicide group, or you are 
not a Muslim and are an infidel and we will kill you. This is 
what propaganda is making of Islam. Islam is said to consist of 
terrorist acts, for instance, accepting suicide attacks, and 
killing those who do not belong to the suicide groups. All this 
will keep people away from Islam. The majority will say: We do 
not want Islam with a bomb and a gun. 
  The battle is not one of bombs and guns; if only it was so. 
If the battle with the United States was a battle of guns, we 
would definitely defeat the United States. The United States is 
a terrorist power and not an occupation power. We would then 
defeat it when we became fearless of terrorism. The United 
States is only a terrorist power, and it could not win with 
other means. The United States was defeated in Vietnam by the 
rifle. Its planes were defeated and destroyed when it attacked 
Libya, a small country. It could not occupy Iraq. Its soldiers 
were worried to enter al-Ahwaz, al-Ahwar, and the marshes. 
[sentence as heard] The United States was defeated in Somalia's 
forests by Somali gun and stones. It fears revolutionary Korea. 
If only the battle was one of guns, the United States would 
definitely be defeated. The United States is a winner, not 
because of the bomb or the machine gun. No, it is because it 
feels it is psychologically strong. It feels strong on another 
plane: on an economic, social, and political plane. 
  Therefore, we need a movement to motivate the nation 
politically, socially, and economically. We need to restore 
ethics and authenticity. 
  We can close our streets without a gun, and not a single 
Israeli would be allowed to enter Arab land. Even the countries 
who recognize Israel could not have diplomatic ties with us, 
because if we are in control of our streets, the ambassador 
would not be able to walk in our streets. There would be no 
room for him. He would not come in the first place if he knew 
the streets were closed, even if the governments would recognize 
him. 
  We want a full mobilization of the nation before thinking of 
guns. We will not call for the killing of the Israelis who have 
been touring and trampling down Arab soil these last days and 
weeks. 
  We do not call for their killing. We call for their 
rejection and the closure of our streets to them so that 
governments are forced not to receive Jews again or assume the 
responsibility for their safety, food, and drink, which are no 
longer guaranteed. 
  For your information, in Libya there is legislation issued 
by 
the Libyan people within the Basic People's Congresses on the 
implementation of the Islamic law. All the laws in Libya are 
compatible now with Islamic law. This is a step forward. Yes, 
we should put pressure throughout other Islamic and Arab 
countries to implement Islamic law. You all know about the air 
embargo against Libya and the attempts to freeze Libyan assets 
abroad and to force countries to reduce their diplomatic 
representation in Libya, but the majority of countries did not 
respond to these attempts because they had interests in Libya. 
  A group of Libyan pilgrims have gone to Mecca by a Libyan 
plane in the past, maybe last year or the year before, to 
perform pilgrimage, but they were intercepted in the air and 
forbidden to land in accordance with the air embargo issued by 
the United States, Britain, and France. The pilgrims found that 
this decision, issued by these Christian countries, applied to 
Mecca and Medina. They were shocked and extremely outraged and 
swore by God to go to occupied Jerusalem--as Mecca has become 
like Jerusalem--in order to announce to the Muslim nation that 
Mecca has become subjected to the will of the United States, 
France, and Britain. 
  They then returned and travelled by rented cars to Egypt 
from 
an airport near the artificial Egyptian-Libyan borders. From 
Egypt they hired the services of a travel agency in the occupied 
territories to take them to Jerusalem. The Israeli tourism 
minister and his entourage tried to consider this as an 
initiative from the Libyans to hold contacts with the Israelis, 
but they were shocked and disappointed when the Libyan pilgrims 
announced that they had come to announce that Jerusalem is 
occupied and should be liberated and that they had come to 
Muslim Jerusalem in response to our rejection from Mecca . 
  The Israelis demanded a speedy departure of the Libyan 
pilgrims from the Aqsa Mosque because their presence constituted 
a threat. Their statements were inciting to the Muslims in the 
occupied territory and outside and had also exposed the 
difficult situation of holy Mecca. Consequently, all the 
parties that sought to cover themselves exerted pressure on the 
Libyan pilgrims in order to make them depart quickly. They 
actually asked them to leave. 
  This year we were expecting the Arab countries responsible 
for Mecca and Medina and the countries that lie between Libya 
and Mecca to disregard the embargo on the route that leads to 
Mecca. We were expecting them to say: The Libyans are free if 
they can fly from their country. We open the skies before them 
and open Mecca before them and would not ask them to have 
permission from the Security Council before entering Mecca nor 
deny them permission to fly through our skies to Mecca without 
permission from the Security Council. 
  The entire world knows what the Security Council is; the 
Security Council is America, Britain, and France. How can we 
ask permission for pilgrimage from Christians? This is 
blasphemy that is not allowed and is rejected. 
  The Libyan pilgrims were obliged this year to travel to 
Mecca 
on the backs of camels. I beg you to inform all peoples of the 
Islamic nation of this and to disseminate the news through all 
of the Muslim information media so that the Islamic world will 
know the difficult situation in Mecca and the deteriorated 
conditions in which the Islamic and Arab peoples are living. 
[passage omitted] 
  You have to think of freeing your will so that Mecca is 
subjected to Christian domination before thinking of pilgrimage. 
I believe and I am convinced that this pilgrimage will not be 
accepted by God ever. It is blind imitation and tourism, and it 
helps improve Saudi Arabia's income only. This is a pilgrimage 
I attack, and I consider it as a pre-Islamic ritual, [words 
indistinct] [passage omitted] 
  I believe that the aim of the Libyan pilgrims, who have 
left on camel back and whose caravan set off yesterday or today, 
is to expose the shameful situation in which we and those in 
God's house and the tomb of God's messenger are in. We want to 
show for example that Sudan banned aircraft because it 
implements the resolutions of Christian states. Egypt, for 
instance, banned aircraft because it implements the resolutions 
of Christian states, and Saudi Arabia banned pilgrims because it 
implements the resolutions of Christian states. Even Libya, if 
it does not have the courage to launch its aircraft, is cowardly 
and implements the resolutions of the Christian states. The 
aim, then, is to show them the trouble imposed by America, 
Britain, and France on Muslims, on a Muslim people. Let the 
Islamic nation watch women, children, men, and old people who 
want to perform real pilgrimage and who cannot go by air and 
sea. Their private cars cannot get them to Mecca, and they 
cannot hire cars to go to Mecca. So they went by camels, which 
was the means available. [passage omitted] 
  We challenge Egyptian Islamic extremist groups to only open 
up the land route to pilgrimage via 'Um Rashrash. Those groups 
are, of course, fighting the Egyptian Government, so if they 
were to carry out this act, it would definitely not be blamed on 
the Egyptian Government because the latter itself is at war with 
those groups. 
  So, if these groups go and fight to liberate 'Um Rashrash, 
which is Eilat, do you think it would affect the peace process 
between Egypt and Israel, or will it be blamed on the Egyptian 
Government? Never, ever, because as I said, the Egyptian 
Government itself is in a state of war with these groups. 
  Yes, we challenge the Afghan mojahedin, the Algerian Islamic 
Salvation Front militants, the Islamic movement in Sudan. We 
challenge them all to go and open up the land route to the 
pilgrimage so that the nation can be territorially united again. 
The nation's back is broken. The Israelis have stretched their 
power from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, so no crossing 
is allowed. 
  Of course, this meeting is an emergency meeting. It 
coincides with the pilgrimage season, because pilgrimage is in a 
critical situation. 
  I wish our brother and friend Fahd was not a political 
leader 
of a political state. Saudi Arabia should become like the 
Vatican, especially after he declared himself the custodian of 
the two holy mosques and not a king. He is officially called 
Fahd Bin-'Abd-al- 'Aziz, custodian of the two holy mosques. 
When he gets this religious status, he will then become 
absolved from the UN Security Council and U.S. domination and so 
on. If Saudi Arabia wants to serve God's house, it should 
change into a state like the Vatican. It should withdraw from 
the political arena and remain a respected religious state. We 
then would respect our Saudi brothers and hold great esteem for 
them as the sponsors, servants, and guardians of God's 
house--provided they cancelled the army, the police, their 
political identity, and their diplomatic passports and remained 
a state concerned only with the holy places and living off 
pilgrimage income. 
  This is the right status, which should, as of now, be raised 
to the Muslim nation and in the Muslim world. We are saying so 
because we were very affected by the nonexistence of such a 
status. We might have news today, tomorrow, or after tomorrow 
on some of our women or men pilgrims dying on their way to Mecca 
on camels. We do not know how many of those pilgrims, who went 
in their hundreds, will come back. 
  Thus, we have been and will continue to be affected as long 
as the pilgrimage is in such a condition. This is not an attack 
on Saudi Arabia at all. It is to help our brothers in Saudi 
Arabia because they are incapable of resisting America. The 
Islamic nation should stand by the Saudis to enable them to 
resist America. 
  Once, after Iraq entered Kuwait, I telephoned King Fahd and 
asked him if it was true that America was entering Saudi Arabia. 
I said that we could--on the Arab and Islamic level--interfere 
and get Iraq's army out and regain Kuwait. Fahd told me that 
America was a superpower, and who would stop it if it entered 
Saudi Arabia. If the situation is like that, therefore, 
America's resolutions will be applicable even in Mecca, because 
America is a superpower. Therefore, the Islamic world should 
embrace, support, and strengthen Saudi Arabia so it can say no 
to America. These are reasonable statements. 
  Our brothers in Saudi Arabia might not be able to oppose 
America, because America is a superpower. Not every one of us 
can oppose America. However, we, at least, say no, even if we 
die. If our brothers in Saudi Arabia are unable to stand up 
against America's resolution, which is currently applicable in 
Mecca, barring Libyan or even Iraqi pilgrims from the town, in 
this case, we should stand by our brothers in Saudi Arabia to 
strengthen their position in order to say no to America and to 
give the Americans a sore eye. 
  Brothers, Mecca should never be part of a political state 
because this political state might go to war with another 
country. How would this other country's president travel to 
Mecca to perform pilgrimage? Iraq was in a state of war with 
Saudi Arabia. Could the Iraqi president travel to Mecca to 
perform pilgrimage? They would have arrested him because his 
country was in a state of war. He would be respected and would 
not be arrested if Mecca did not have a political status. 
[passage omitted] 
  We know that American troops are present in Saudi Arabia, 
and 
the reason is a fear of Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia 
following its occupation of Kuwait. Undoubtedly, Mecca is under 
American protection. 
  This talk should not be misinterpreted, saying that 
al-Qadhdhafi has attacked Al Sa'ud and Saudi Arabia. Not at 
all; we are not attacking Saudi Arabia. I do not believe in 
media attacks or similar nonsense because it does not lead to 
anything. On the contrary, I do sympathize with the Saudis and 
see them in a situation not to be envied. We urge the Islamic 
nation to stand by them in order to give the Americans a sore 
eye, and we urge Saudi Arabia, if it wants to be responsible for 
Mecca, to become a religious state only. [passage omitted] 
  If Saudi Arabia wants to remain a political state, it has to 
relinquish Mecca and Medina to the Islamic Conference 
Organization to run them. Actually, this is what we have been 
demanding constantly. 
  Due to Mecca's bad and difficult condition, this emergency 
meeting of the general secretariat of the WIPC has been held. 
Now, we can try and make Libyan pilgrims request Sudan's 
permission to let a Libyan airplane cross Sudan's airspace and 
head for Mecca. Let us see what Sudan would say. If it said to 
get permission from the Security Council, then Sudan and the way 
to Mecca would be controlled by Christian countries. Or if 
Egypt did. 
  If Sudan gave permission and said that this plane could go 
to 
Mecca and said: I am not interested in how the plane gets out of 
Libya. That is Libya's responsibility. If you want to cross 
our airspace, then do so, as long as you are going to Hajj. 
After arriving in Saudi Arabia, let us see what Saudi Arabia 
would say. Would they say: Get permission from the Security 
Council in order to enter Mecca? 
  Do we enter Mecca with America's permission? Never! [passage 
omitted] 
  Even international communism and all communists throughout 
the world thought that communism was invincible and that planet 
Earth would be red. We said: No, there is something wrong with 
this theory. We said that these peoples would not continue to 
be subjected to the communist parties--though we have a common 
denominator, which is the struggle against imperialism. 
Communism was a deterrent to America. America has no morals. 
It fears. It was afraid of Brezhnev and Khrushchev. When 
America's masters went way, it appeared naked and without morals 
before the world--roaring, sending its troops everywhere, 
interfering in everything, deciding whatever it wished, 
stumbling over human rights and sovereignty-- because it used to 
be afraid. America has no morals. The present U.S. President 
Clinton--though he is a man of peace, young, etc. and has no bad 
past record and was against the Vietnam war--he himself is a 
victim of American imperialism and the CIA. He is afraid for 
himself. Morals make a head of state. American intelligence 
has no morals and is an arch enemy of all the world and wants to 
give itself a licence to violate the whole world. [passage 
omitted] 
  Clinton is afraid of the CIA. He is a victim of the CIA. He 
is afraid because U.S. establishments have no morals. They are 
hellish, as are the big multinational syndicates. The CIA and 
the White House are all bugged. Clinton is living in hell. The 
head of state has no morals. America has no morals. The West 
has no morals and hates the Islamic world. The West said: We 
do not recognize Mohammad. We Muslims recognize Jesus. 
Westerners consider Mohammad a liar and a crook. [passage 
omitted] 
  America has abandoned, when its interests were at stake, its 
best agents. Not its friends, because America has no friends. 
It has either an enemy or an agent. America has no friend at 
all. You will either be its agent or its enemy. America 
abandoned its best agents when its interests were at stake. 
  The West has decided on the nonexistence of an Islamic state 
in Europe, and they are going to eliminate Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and then Albania. Any Islamic pocket will be eliminated in your 
time, and you will still be alive, God willing. You will be 
alive, God willing, and you will regrettably see the achievement 
of this bad thing. 
  We, in return, will not accept a Jewish state in the Islamic 
world. They eliminate pockets, and we eliminate pockets. Let 
it be so. What is taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina--and what 
will happen to Albania, Macedonia, Kosovo, Bulgaria, and 
others--will take place in Palestine. We eliminate pockets, and 
they eliminate pockets. We will accept this. They decided 
that. They decided to eliminate Islamic pockets in Europe. All 
Christian states from Moscow to Washington decided not to allow 
Muslims to have a foot of land in Europe. Europe is Christian. 
From Moscow to Washington it is all Christian. As for you, the 
Arabs and Muslims, however, they want you to accept a racist 
Jewish state that is armed with nuclear weapons--with support 
from the crusading West--inside your land, and they want you to 
bow before it. 
  Regrettably, even Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] said yesterday, 
when he spoke during the farce that took place in Cairo: We 
wished to be gracious to those who were being depressed in the 
land. You make them leaders and make them heirs. This 
[Koranic] verse was said about Jews. He is stressing that we 
have surrendered to Jews, and they have become leaders and 
heirs. This is the meaning. It means: I have come to you to 
share and to surrender, and this is a whole Arab column present 
with me. This is an emphasis of this verse: God was gracious 
to Jews and made them our leaders and heirs of Palestine and 
other places, and all we got was the cursed city that is called 
Jericho and the miserable Gaza. 
  The fact that Abu-'Ammar opened his speech with this verse 
means that the latter was achieved. Jews have become leaders, 
and God made them heirs. 
  What link do the Arab states that attended this ceremony in 
Cairo have with the ceremony and Palestine? I challenge them. 
The states that did not fight and that have no borders with 
Palestine, why do they put their nose in this dust and sand. 
Who has blamed them? They are weak states and should stay 
within their borders. They are not asked to liberate the 
occupied territories or participate in a liberation. Why then 
do they participate in this scandal? 
  This is also a recognition of Israel. All those who 
attended the ceremony in Cairo have recognized Israel. Who are 
they kidding? This is an official recognition of Israel. Any 
state that attended the ceremony shook hands with Peres. What 
is the name of the prime minister of the enemy? Yitzhaq Rabin. 
They all shook hands with him, and it is an announcement of the 
recognition of the Jewish state by the Arab states. [passage 
omitted] 
  Some people have not attended these meetings. Ghannouchi, 
for instance, is a member of the WIPC, which is not the Libyan 
leadership. He is not present now, however, and has not been 
able to attend. He was not even invited. The reason for this 
is that he fell into a dispute with the Tunisian Government. 
Consequently, Tunisia tells us: Brothers, it is not acceptable 
for somebody who is wanted over a political matter and is wanted 
for trial in Tunisia to come and visit Libya because, in return, 
it is not acceptable that somebody who is wanted in Libya is 
treated with deference or (?visits) Tunisia. 
  This is logical. Consequently, he was not invited. We 
wished that there would not be a difference between Ghannouchi 
and the Tunisian Government and that he would not let himself 
get into a dispute to the point where he is banned from staying 
in Tunisia or Libya. We wish that the action would remain 
peaceful, democratic, and political, and hope to make people 
aware, which is a permitted action. Now there is an accusation 
that there is a coup action, however, violence that is outside 
legality, constitutionality, and laws. 
  What is striking in this context is that Britain gave 
Ghannouchi political asylum. I have watched the development of 
ties between Tunisia and Britain since the latter gave 
Ghannouchi political asylum. Ties have improved, and recently 
there were delegations, aid, loans, and a development in ties 
between Tunisia and Britain. That is wonderful. 
  Let us assume, however, that Libya gave Ghannouchi political 
asylum. What would the Tunisian Government's position be toward 
Libya. It would be different. It could sever ties. We did not 
allow him to come in peace to a session of the WIPC out of 
consideration for the position of our brothers in Tunisia who 
want to put him on trial. Why did Tunisia not cut ties with 
Britain? That is the problem, the problem of Arabs, of Muslims. 
They overlook the wrongdoing of the enemy, their interference, 
and humiliations. 
  When Algeria was under Ali Kafi's rule, I said this from 
this 
position--or maybe somewhere else--that I could bring 
reconciliation between the Islamic Salvation Front and the 
Algerian Government because they were my friends. I prayed with 
them, knew them, and had debates with them. They could accept 
some talk from me on opening dialogue with the Algerian 
Government and setting aside the fighting. 
  The Algerian Government under Ali Kafi issued a statement 
against al-Qadhdhafi. It spoke about interference and so on, 
whereas delegations from European countries were going to 
Algeria to check up on prisoners and human rights. There were 
no objections about them because they were coming from 
colonialist Christian countries. See what a system we have! 
  How could Britain give political asylum to Ghannouchi. 
Ghannouchi was more entitled to being given asylum by Arab 
states and not Britain. Britain, in that case, took a position 
in opposition to the Tunisian regime. Tunisia should have 
severed ties with Britain and not have had ties improve. If 
Ghannouchi's presence in the country where he is now is not 
considered wrong, then the WIPC has not done its duty. It did 
not issue an invitation to Ghannouchi--if only to attend one day 
of this session of which he is a member. 
  Britain gave him permanent residence and political asylum, 
and its ties with Tunisia have improved! What we are saying is 
in Tunisia's defense. We are saying this for Tunisia against 
Britain because it is clear that our brothers in Tunisia cannot 
tell Britain these things. We can say it on their behalf and in 
defense of Saudi Arabia because it cannot say these things to 
the Islamic world or to America. I can say them on its behalf 
because of my position, as head of the WIPC. If I were 
president of the Libyan state, I would not say them. 
  The BBC is known to be part of the British Government. The 
Arabic service there is part of British intelligence. It is 
known that it was established during World War II to counter 
Berlin. [passage omitted] 
  This radio, for example, had an interview with a Saudi named 
Binladin, who fled Saudi Arabia. He said his son had been 
detained in Saudi Arabia to pressure him to return to the 
kingdom. He gave an interview to this radio to attack our 
brothers in Saudi Arabia. Ties between Saudi Arabia and Britain 
were not cut. 
  Let us assume that Binladin went to a Libyan broadcast and 
gave the interview. Ties between Libya and Saudi Arabia would 
inevitably be cut the following day. Look at our situation. 
Those who come from the West are as though they have come from 
God. We accept them. Our brothers, however, are lying in wait. 
During Ali Kafi's reign, no objections were raised at 
interference by France and the West in Algeria's internal 
affairs or at the sending of inspection committees. They 
objected to one word I said here in Algeria's interest. 
  Binladin made statements to the BBC and nothing happened to 
ties. [passage omitted] 
  We must work to ensure the presence of the WIPC at 
international events at the United Nations. 
  We must make our voice heard to the whole world, and we 
must work for, call for, the convening of an urgent Islamic 
summit to tackle the Mecca situation and the road to Mecca. It 
does not matter that the Libyan people are being besieged, 
starved, even fought, and if it dies on its feet, or [this is 
happening to] the Iraqi people or any other people, the issue in 
question is that of Mecca. 
  We are not asking our Arab brothers, whether in Egypt, 
Sudan, 
Saudi Arabia, or Jordan, to stand on our side against America so 
that the Libyan assets may be unfrozen, or the air embargo, the 
boycott, and the siege lifted. No, not at all. We are not 
asking them for this. We want to argue with them about the road 
to Mecca and the pilgrimage to Mecca, Mecca itself. The Libyan 
people has the right to address itself to the Islamic nation and 
show that it has set off on foot and by camel from Libya to 
Mecca. 
  Mecca and the road to Mecca are in an intolerable situation. 
They allow camels in but they do not allow [Libyan] airliners 
because the resolution [on the embargo] made by America, 
Britain, and France does not mention camels and donkeys, and 
therefore, Libyan pilgrimages have set off by camel and donkey 
because the latter are not mentioned in the resolution. If they 
were mentioned in the resolution then the Arabs would have 
opposed the passage of donkeys and camels from Libya to Mecca. 
I am sure of this. There is on the part of Arab rulers a blind 
obedience to America and Britain and disobedience to God. I 
wish only part of the rulers' obedience to America was obedience 
to Almighty God! They are literally bound by America's orders, 
and they are not bound by a single word from the Koran. 
  To conclude, if we want to undertake an historic deed for 
the 
Islamic nation in confronting the enemy, we should not begin 
with the rifle, the gun, and the bomb as they are now doing in 
Egypt and Algeria. This is wrong. No. We must first engage in 
a cultural revolution. we must return to our authenticity, our 
origin, our roots. So long as they do not recognize Muhammad as 
a prophet, then why should we use the calendar based on the 
history of Jesus? There is no need for Jesus. This has been 
abolished, dropped definitively in Libya [where a calendar based 
on the birth and death of the prophet is in use]. If you want a 
calendar based on birth, then it is Muhammad's birthday; if you 
want a calendar based on death, then it is the passing of 
Muhammad. Muhammad is more important than Jesus because he is 
the last prophet who, after his birth and death the direct link 
between heaven and earth was severed. We have not heard a 
single word from heaven since. [passage omitted] May God never 
bring about understanding between us, the Christians and the 
Jews until doomsday! Why should we come to an understanding? 
Who said that we must? Who said this? Barricades separate us 
from them until doomsday. This is eternal enmity. God has 
decided so. It is they who do not recognize our prophet, our 
religion, language, and existence, and it is they who said that 
confrontation has ended with communism and that it will begin 
with Islam. 
  They have started this. Why this eagerness to have relations 
with them in the West, as if they were a ladder to God? If lack 
of relations with the West means no survival for us, then may 
God take away our lives; may we die in 24 hours if our life 
under the sun and on earth depends on relations with the West. 
May we die immediately, rather than have relations with the 
West in this shameful manner. [applause] [passage omitted] 
  God willing, we have set off, step by step on the 1,000 mile 
journey toward the objective; unspecified, and the first giant 
step is the founding of this WIPC. Our struggle and jihad 
continue, and we pray for God's help. Peace and mercy of God be 
upon you. [applause]

  [Text] The speaker of the Libyan Parliament described 
Iran's policy of defending the rights of Muslims and Islamic 
values as independent and a source of pride for the world of 
Islam. 
  At a meeting in Tripoli with our country's ambassador, which 
was for the purpose of handing over a written message from 
Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri, the Libyan parliamentary speaker 
said: The free will and resistance of Islamic Iran in dealing 
with the problems of the world of Islam, and her defense of 
Islamic values, raise the morale of Muslim peoples in tackling 
problems. 
  At the meeting, our country's ambassador outlined the common 
viewpoints of Iran and Libya on important global issues. He 
called for more activity by the two countries' parliamentary 
friendship groups. 
  Also a written message from Nateq-Nuri about the painful and 
dangerous conditions in Bosnia-Herzegovina was handed to Nabih 
Birri, the speaker of the Lebanese National Assembly. 
  According to a Central News Unit report from Beirut, our 
country's ambassador in Beirut told reporters on Monday, after 
delivering the message, that he had discussed ways of 
cooperation and coordination between parliaments of Islamic 
countries in the defense of the innocent and oppressed people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and to bring to an end to the massacre of 
that Muslim nation. 
  Our country's ambassador added: The Gaza-Jericho agreement 
is, in fact, a security agreement, which is aimed at 'Arafat's 
police crushing the Intifadah and fighting the Palestinian 
nation.

  [Text] Tripoli, Al Maa [May] 8, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS 
AGENCY--The emergency meeting of the general secretariat of the 
International Islamic People's Command, held on 5-7th instant 
under the banner "Enabling Muslims To Defend Their Holy Places", 
concluded its proceedings last night in Tripoli. 
  The secretariat issued a communique at the end of the 
meeting 
asserting that the meeting was held at the darkest time in the 
history of Muslims as crusader tyranny and encroachment affected 
all affairs of Muslims. 
  The secretariat pointed out that this encroachment by 
Western 
crusaders on Muslims and their holy shrines went as far as 
controlling their religious practice and tutelage over their 
holy places like Mecca and Medina and setting conditions on 
Muslims in the fulfilment of their religious obligations. 
  The secretariat cited in this respect the ban imposed on the 
Libyan Arab pilgrims preventing them from travelling to the holy 
places. 
  The secretariat urged all Muslims, as individuals, groups 
and 
governments, to shoulder their responsibility regarding this 
encroachment and onslaught on Muslim holy shrines and 
intervention in their worshipping matters. 
  The secretariat stressed the need for Muslims to stand 
against the resolutions of the so called Security Council which 
follows a double standard policy and directs one humiliation 
after another against Muslims. 
  The communique called for issuing clearly the Islamic legal 
view on the intervention of a non Muslim side in the Muslims' 
religious affairs and embargo against them and to convey this 
ruling to all non-governmental and official organisations and 
institutions in the Muslim world, international organisations 
and human rights institutions.

  Tripoli, 10 May (JANA) -- JANA's international affairs 
editor has asserted that the facts have been reaffirming day in 
and day out that the United States is the number one terrorist 
state in the world and the most serious threat to world security 
and peace. 
  The editor added that America does not want to see peoples 
free; it accuses sovereign countries of terrorism just because 
these countries are not under any foreign influence. 
  He affirmed that the countries which America has accused of 
terrorism are the only free states in the world. That is why 
these states have been facing U.S. terrorism [words indistinct] 
for no other reason than the fact that they have rejected 
foreign influence and refused foreign political dictation. 
  The editor went to say that America is an anti-peace and 
tyrannical power. It is behind the destruction and the havoc in 
the world by creating and fuelling wars and conflicts and the 
acquisition of biological weapons of mass destruction which are 
a threat to the world as a whole. It is also the source of 
morbid diseases facing the world today, like AIDS, through its 
CIA-run laboratories. 
  The editor affirmed that America is exposed before all 
peoples as a state which has been practising state terrorism, 
supporting terrorism, and giving refuge to terrorists. It is no 
longer possible to fool anyone with American preaching about 
terrorism and peace. America is the leader of terrorism and the 
number one enemy of peace.

  [Text] Through its Arabic service, which is controlled by 
British intelligence, London radio has interviewed the wife of 
the Saudi dissident Muhammad al-Mas'ari, a prominent member of 
the human rights committee in Saudi Arabia, who now lives in 
Britain. Mas'ari's wife said in the interview that she and her 
family are being harassed by the Saudi authorities and that the 
latter arrested three of her husband's brothers. 
  Commenting on this, JANA's Arab affairs editor says: For the 
second time in a few days London radio's Arabic service, which 
is controlled by the British intelligence, has attacked the 
Saudi authorities and reported news, statements, and information 
which tarnish the reputation of the Saudi political regime in 
such a way that it can clearly be considered as blatant 
interference in Saudi internal affairs. Despite this, no Saudi 
official reply has been made. 
  The editor wondered: Why does Saudi Arabia not reply to and 
protest this British Government radio station which is being 
incited by British intelligence to insult Saudi Arabia and 
attack its regime. What would have happened if what this radio 
has done had been done by an Arab radio or other Arab media. 
Would Saudi Arabia have remained silent and accepted it with 
magnanimity, as it once accepted what was published by the U.S. 
TIME magazine, which is linked to U.S. official circles, and 
what is broadcast by the Arabic service of the British radio 
station which is controlled by British intelligence?

<F P=106> [Report by Talhah Jibril: "Libyan-Tunisian Relations </F>
Experiencing Silent Crisis"] 
  [Excerpts] Rabat -- AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that 
Tunisian-Libyan relations are currently experiencing a silent 
crisis following the Tunisian authorities' arrest of two Libyans 
belonging to the Islamic Call Organization [munazzamat al-da'wah 
al-islamiyah] [ICO], a Libyan government organization headed by 
Dr. Muhammad al-Sharif. Sources say that the two Libyans 
intended to offer financial assistance to some members of the 
outlawed Ennahda movement in Tunisia. 
  Libyans arriving from Tunisia say that the Tunisian 
authorities have begun to subject Libyans traveling across 
Tunisian territory to thorough search measures, and that some 
Libyan travelers are forced to stand for many hours at 
checkpoints on the border between the two countries. [passage 
omitted] 
  Well-informed sources say that the ICO, whose headquarters 
is 
in Tripoli, is linked to a Libyan organ. The organization, 
which publishes THE JIHAD magazine, performed several activities 
in Africa, especially in west African states, under the cover of 
Islamic preaching. The organization owns several facilities and 
buildings in Libya. 
  This is not the first time Tunisian-Libyan relations have 
experienced coolness as a result of the links between the ICO 
and the outlawed Ennahda movement. Dr. al-Sharif, who is in 
charge of the organization, intervened with Tunisia as Colonel 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's envoy to secure the release of some 
Ennahda and ICO prisoners. 
  After the embargo was imposed on Libya, the organization's 
name was changed to the Call College [kulliyat al-da'wah], but 
its activities have continued in the same manner. [passage

  [Text] Cairo, 10 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
stated that Egypt will spare no effort to achieve a 
comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East on the basis of 
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of 
land for peace. 
  This came in the foreign minister's speech addressed to the 
Refugees Working Group of the multilateral peace talks, which 
began its meetings today. The speech was read out on his behalf 
by Ambassador Ahmad 'Utham, the head of Egypt's delegation to 
the meetings. 
  The foreign minister said Egypt is convinced of the chances 
for pursuing the long road to peace and overcoming its 
difficulties and challenges. 
  Musa reiterated Egypt's stance on the refugee issue. He said 
that without a fair solution to this problem, there will be no 
peace or stability in the region, especially after the 
Palestinians felt that they were left alone to suffer, deprived 
of their legitimate and acknowledged rights, after their 
brothers in Namibia and South Africa were liberated. 
  He also stressed the importance of the repatriation of the 
diaspora refugees and reunion of the displaced families, noting 
that the Egyptian delegation can see no reason to delay the 
realization of such a humane goal. 
  Representatives from 45 countries, including Israel, in 
addition to UN and World Bank representatives, are participating 
in the three days of meetings. 
  The delegates will discuss several issues, including 
reuniting Palestinian families, improving the health conditions 
of the refugees, especially those of the children and women, and 
improving the economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. The delegates will also discuss a report from the 
committee that visited refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon last 
month.

  [Text] Cairo, 10 May (MENA)--The Fifth Arab Energy 
Conference has underscored the importance of proceeding with 
studies and research into oil and energy in the Arab world and 
developing new methods, particularly at the level of economic 
institutions. 
  The conference made recommendations today, stressing the 
need 
to continue making efforts to cut the economic and social costs 
incurred by the growing local consumption of oil. It 
recommended the expansion of utilizing natural gas to increase 
the portion of exported oil and its byproducts. 
  The conference that opened last Saturday called for 
upgrading 
exploration operations to increase Arab oil and natural gas 
reserves and thus meet the expected growth in world demand for 
oil and benefit from new technologies that have proved feasible 
in the field of exploration, drilling, and production. 
  Organized by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting 
Countries, OAPEC, the Arab League, the Arab Fund for Economic 
and Social Development, and the Arab Organization for Industrial 
Development, the conference called for enhancing opportunities 
for exchanging natural gas among Arab states. It also called 
for launching a feasibility study on setting up a natural gas 
network to link production sites with consuming areas and thus 
achieve the optimal exploitation of that source. 
  The conference praised Arab efforts to use new and renewable 
energies and emphasized the need for paying more attention to 
the development of Arab capabilities in that field. 
  Held under the chairmanship of Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi 
al-Banbi and with the participation of Arab energy and oil 
ministers, the conference called for going ahead with 
electricity grid projects in both the Arab Mashreq and Maghreb. 
  The conference discussed 23 working papers on the oil 
industry, electricity linkage, and the expansion in using new 
and renewable energies. It called for expanding the exchange of 
oil products among Arab states to diversify consuming markets 
and for encouraging the private sector to set up companies to 
market and distribute oil products in Arab markets. 
  The energy conference underlined the need to develop 
petrochemical industries in Arab states and to expand the 
manufacture of basic material needed for horizontal integration 
to cope with the demand in Arab markets, increase exports to 
world markets, and coordinate among Arab producers in production 
and marketing. 
  The Fifth Arab Energy Conference emphasized the need for 
Arab 
and international capital to provide the necessary investments 
to carry out the needed projects in the various fields of 
energy. It called on Arab and international banks and financial 
institutions to pay more attention to the preparation of 
feasibility studies for energy-related projects. It also called 
for providing the necessary investments to develop the oil 
sector and for protecting investment-related decisions against 
fluctuations in oil prices. 
  The conference stressed the need for Arab countries to 
preserve the environment and take its protection into 
consideration in launching development projects. It also urged 
Arab countries to sensitize the public about protecting the 
environment and curbing pollution. 
  The conference expressed concern regarding the negative 
effects the proposed oil tax might have on oil. It viewed this 
suggested tax as an act of discrimination against oil, 
maintaining that the actual goal consuming countries seek to 
achieve by imposing this tax is to increase their revenues at 
the expense of the oil-producing developing countries. It also 
expressed its fears that this tax might have a negative effect 
on the world economy in general and oil-producing and exporting 
countries' economies in particular. 
  The energy conference called for subsidizing Arab scientific 
research centers to study and follow up on the problem of the 
changing climate to ensure that the allegations made against 
petroleum lack scientific proof and that oil is not the main 
reason behind the increase of the carbon dioxide. It urged 
research centers to publicize scientific facts, information, and 
findings of studies into the problem of changing climates. 
  The conferees urged Arab and developing states to coordinate 
their stance at international gatherings to explain the negative 
impacts development programs in these countries might suffer if 
discriminative measures are taken against petroleum when 
discussing ways to curb the discharge of pollutant gas into the 
atmosphere. 
  It stressed the need for developing a data base on sources 
of 
energy and the demand for it in the various economic sectors to 
use in studies and research. It urged the organizations 
concerned to supply the Arab Center for Energy Studies with the 
necessary information and data for its studies. 
  In its recommendations, the energy conference called for 
enhancing cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC states and between 
them and consuming countries to provide a suitable climate to 
establish market stability and avoid price fluctuation. 
  The conference welcomed the invitation Syrian Oil Minister 
Nadir al-Nabulsi made to hold the sixth energy conference in 
Damascus in 1998. 
  Speaking on behalf of the organizing bodies, OAPEC Secretary 
General Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Turki expressed appreciation for 
Egypt, its people, president, and government for hosting the 
conference. He thanked President Mubarak for helping the 
conference and Dr. Hamdi al-Banbi for the efforts he made to 
assist the organizing bodies in arranging it.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 3 May issue 
of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Islamists Win Elections in Cairo University Club 
  2. Muslim Brotherhood Appeals to Yemeni Parties To 
Preserve 
  Unity 
  3. Military Court Sentences AL-SHA'B Military Editor 
  4. Islamic Writer Criticizes Government's Handling of 
Violence 
  5. Writer Assails Government's Bid To Foil Political Islam 
<H5>  ISLAMISTS WIN ELECTIONS IN CAIRO UNIVERSITY TEACHING CLUB </H5>
  A 150-word unattributed report on page 1 says the Islamic 
trend at Cairo University won a landslide victory in the 
elections to the Cairo University Teaching Club. The report 
notes that the Islamists won the four seats and that 93 percent 
of the voters gave their support to the Islamists in a 
democratic atmosphere. 
<H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD APPEALS TO YEMENI PARTIES TO PRESERVE </H5>
UNITY 
  A 150-word unattributed report on page 1 notes that the 
Muslim Brotherhood appealed to the parties to the conflict in 
Yemen to safeguard the public interest and settle differences 
within the framework of a constructive dialogue based on the 
shari'ah and to place Yemeni unity above all other 
considerations. The report says that the Muslim Brotherhood 
called on the Arab and Muslim leaders and organizations to play 
the required role in closing the Yemeni ranks and stopping the 
bloodshed. 
<H5>  MILITARY COURT SENTENCES AL-SHA'B MILITARY EDITOR </H5>
  A 200-word report on page 1 by 'Abd-al-Fattah Fayid says 
that 
after one hearing, the military court sentenced AL-SHA'B 
military editor 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn to one year with hard 
labor and ordered him to pay a 500-pound fine. The paper notes 
that he was arrested after publishing a report on the Bright 
Star maneuvers between Egypt and Western countries. The report 
says that the military editors of the Journalists Syndicate and 
journalists doyen Ibrahim Naf'i sent a memorandum to the defense 
minister urging him not to ratify the ruling. 
<H5>  ISLAMIC WRITER CRITICIZES GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF VIOLENCE </H5>
  In an approximately 2,000-word article on page 3, Islamic 
Brotherhood writer Dr. Ahmad al-Malat claims that a trustworthy 
mosque preacher told him that mosque prayer leaders receive 
instructions directly from the Awqaf Ministry "not to mention 
Palestine, talk badly of Jews, or comment on Bosnia in their 
Friday sermons." Al-Malat asks the Awqaf minister if this is 
the mosque's mission in the country that is home to the al-Azhar 
Mosque. He asks: Shouldn't the Muslims know about Islamic 
issues that are the focus of world media? He says what he calls 
the intelligence henchmen want the Egyptians to forget the 
peoples of Palestine and Bosnia and leave them to their fate. 
He asks if a mosque and a preacher's mission have become so 
trivial. He argues that this attitude does a great injustice to 
the sublime mission of Islam and the Muslims' right to know 
about Muslim issues. 
  Discussing violence by Muslim youths, al-Malat says: We 
"agree" with these youths on the goal of serving the Islamic 
call but "differ" with them over the means. He says Islam calls 
for preserving the sanctity of life, property, and honor and 
draws limits that Muslims should not exceed. He says: We the 
Muslim Brotherhood "cannot accuse these youths of being 
mercenaries, hirelings, or renegades," as we have no evidence. 
But we maintain that they are Muslim youths who have "gone 
astray." 
  Addressing government officials, al-Malat states that they 
have a right to pursue crime but within the framework of Islamic 
shari'ah, not their laws that they call democracy. He claims 
that government officials have no right to take power, 
deactivate the laws, and impose the emergency law to "humiliate 
the people and subjugate them." He suggests that they have no 
right to prevent particular preachers from addressing the 
masses. He argues that the Muslim Brotherhood is "more capable 
of understanding" these youths and closer to the right path of 
holding a dialogue with them, especially in view of the failure 
of every government effort embodied in the enlightenment convoys 
that tour the country. If the officials "think rationally and 
avoid wielding a heavy stick" it will be easy to address this 
problem. "Direct dialogue" with these youths is the way to get 
closest to their minds. This, the author believes, requires 
"recognition of the right of the Muslim Brotherhood to free 
movement among the youths without control or spying." He 
contends that the government can silence voices with whips but 
cannot stop resentment "seething" in the hearts of youths, which 
will eventually give vent to disaster. 
<H5>  WRITER ASSAILS GOVERNMENT'S BID TO FOIL POLITICAL ISLAM </H5>
  Muhammad Jamal Mishhat, in a 500-word column on page 8, 
discusses the escalating acts of violence in Egypt. He claims 
that the government and its media "endorse a policy hostile to 
Islam." He suggests they "penetrated" the Islamic groups, 
"distorted" their image, and shed their blood. The Muslim 
Brotherhood, he says, learned from 20 years of experience in 
jail and notes that "no Muslim Brotherhood member has been 
involved in acts of violence." The Muslim Brotherhood accepted 
democracy and entered the People's Assembly and various other 
associations. They achieved reforms but their "achievements 
have been fought" and the government is "escalating the 
confrontation" because it wants to "foil the success of 
political Islam" in the same way it foiled the attempts to 
revive economic Islam.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 3 May issue 
of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Editor Assails al-Azhar Critics 
  2. Columnist Urges Law Organizing Religious Rulings 
  3. Conference Considering Copts as Minority Criticized 
  4. Religious Seminar Says No Link Between Islam and

  7. Chadian Islamic Official Interviewed

<H5>  EDITOR ASSAILS AL-AZHAR CRITICS </H5>
  In his back-page 400-word "A Call to Reason" column, Chief 
Editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf mocks "the children of the West" 
in Egypt who call for minimizing the role of al-Azhar. He cites 
some of the ideas of these "children," who he says "claim to 
lead an enlightenment campaign." For example, he says, they 
accuse al-Azhar of expanding the base of extremism and opening 
the door to terrorism. They are further quoted as advocating 
that Islamic education at schools must be kept to a minimum "so 
that extremist thought may not invade the minds of our sons and 
daughters and threaten national unity." And they are said to 
deny the existence of such things as moderate Islam, as opposed 
to extremist Islam. Commenting on this, the writer says: "May 
God curse an enlightenment essentially based on demolishing 
religion, desecrating sanctities, and undermining the constant 
principles that preserved this nation for centuries despite 
vicious attacks. May God protect Islam and Egypt from every 
treacherous hand trying to harm them, either by bullets or the 
pen." 
<H5>  COLUMNIST URGES LAW ORGANIZING RELIGIOUS RULINGS </H5>
  In his 400-word "Rightfully I Say" column on page one, Samir 
Rajab, the newspaper's board chairman, calls for unifying fatwas 
[religious rulings]. He calls for legislation imposing severe 
punishment on anyone passing fatwas without having the official 
power to do so. To support his call, he claims that mosques, 
which are open to anyone, "were behind the breeding of 
terrorism. False muftis emerged along with false preachers, and 
they both played a serious role in planting the seeds of 
terrorism." The writer believes that "depending on security 
alone to face the phenomenon of terrorism is not enough." He 
urges the government to rush to draft a law unifying fatwas 
"otherwise the government would be supporting terrorism without 
knowing it." 
<H5>  CONFERENCE LABELLING COPTS AS MINORITY CRITICIZED </H5>
  A 700-word report by Tariq 'Abdallah on page two focuses on 
a conference on minorities in the Arab world and the Middle East 
organized by an Egyptian studies center. 'Abdallah says: Many 
accusations have been leveled against the organizers, especially 
for characterizing the Copts in Egypt as a minority. Dr. Sa'd 
al-Din Ibrahim, president of the organizing center, is cited 
defending the conference and the British organization financing 
it. Ibrahim says that objection to the presentation of Egypt's 
Copts as a minority is acceptable but he stresses that the 
conference aim is to discuss the problems and concerns of the 
Copts in Egypt, not their status. 
  Dr. Muhammad Ibrahim al-Fayyumi, secretary general of the 
Higher Council for Islamic Affairs, is quoted criticizing the 
conference and maintaining that Egypt's Copts cannot be labelled 
as a minority because they are Egyptians governed by the 
Egyptian Constitution and have the same rights and duties as 
Muslims. He says Copts have no special problems or concerns. 
Former Government Attorney Edward Ghali al-Dhahabi describes 
the conference as "very bad" and maintains that Copts are an 
integral part of Egyptian society. 
  A related item on the conference, a 700-word article by 
Majdi 
Salim on page 10, discusses attempts to "wake up sedition" under 
the guise of freedom of expression and thought. Implicitly 
referring to the minorities conference as one of these attempts, 
the writer states: "Every citizen in Egypt is Egyptian. They 
are all of the same race. There is no such thing as a minority 
or majority and everyone has citizenship rights without 
discrimination." In his article, Salim also refers to writers 
who criticized a decision by some governors to prevent the use 
of satellite dishes in cafes and public places in their 
governorates to protect youths from watching explicit movies. 
<H5>  RELIGIOUS SEMINAR SAYS NO LINK BETWEEN ISLAM AND TERRORISM </H5>
  An approximately 2,000-word report on page four, attributed 
to Mamduh al-'Ushri, Musa Hal, and Nazih Fudah, details a 
religious seminar organized by 'AQIDATI at a youth center in 
al-Daqahliyah Governorate. Speakers addressed the audience and 
answered questions on religious issues and practices. Asked 
about Islam's relationship with terrorism, the newspaper's chief 
editor, al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, is quoted as replying: "There 
is no relationship between Islam and terrorism. Indeed, Western 
media are seriously and intentionally promoting this mistaken 
belief and, regrettably, some news media here are joining them, 
with bad intentions." He is cited adding: "The assassinations 
or bombings taking place here cannot be linked with Islam, even 
if they are perpetrated by Muslims. These people are not real 
Muslims. Islam is not a bloody religion." He is further quoted 
as saying that confronting terrorism is the responsibility of 
all society. 
<H5>  SEMINAR SAYS ISLAMIC PENAL CODE REFORMS SOCIETY </H5>
  An approximately 1,500-word unattributed report on page 10 
cites speakers at a seminar on "The Concept of Integration of 
Islam" organized by the Islamic Research and Studies Center at 
Cairo University. The speakers discuss the foundations of Islam 
that make it an integrated religion. One of these, according to 
one speaker, is Islamic legislation--the laws and provisions 
that organize the life of the Muslim individual and group and 
that determine punishments. Dr. Muhammad Baltaji, dean of 
Dar-al-'Ulum College, is cited attacking those who brand the 
Islamic system of punishment as inhuman. He says the 
application of the Islamic penal code, which does not 
differentiate between the rich and the poor, or the strong and 
the weak, reforms society. He adds: "The application of the 
penal code is the way out of today's problems. The best proof 
is that the rate of crime is less in societies that apply 
shari'ah than in others." 
<H5>  "KORANIC MEDICINE" OFFENSE TO ISLAM </H5>
  Pages 12 and 13 feature an approximately 3,500-word report 
by 
Jamal Salim discussing "a serious phenomenon spreading in 
several towns and villages in Egypt's countryside, namely, 
medical treatment through the Koran." "Koranic doctors" 
reportedly treat all kinds of illness, from fatigue and colic to 
paralysis and impotence. The reporter asks Egypt's mufti, 
Muhammad Tantawi, and other clerics, psychologists, and 
sociologists about this practice. They maintain that the 
phenomenon offends Islam and they attribute it to ignorance and 
to charlatans exploiting people's religious sentiments. Tantawi 
says the Koran can be used to treat souls for hatred, envy, and 
similar psychological symptoms but not physical diseases. 
  A related 150-word report by Musa Hal on page one says 
al-Azhar's Fatwa Committee warned against the Koran being used 
by charlatans to profit and exploit simple-minded people under 
the pretext of treating diseases. The committee said that using 
the Koran to mislead the simple is a major crime and a sin. 
<H5>  CHADIAN ISLAMIC OFFICIAL INTERVIEWED </H5>
  On page 20 there is an approximately 1,500-word interview 
with the chairman of the Higher Islamic Affairs Council in Chad, 
Imam Husayn Hasan Abu-Bakr, by Tariq 'Abdallah. Abu-Bakr 
discusses the problems facing Muslims in his country, al-Azhar's 
important role in serving Islam, and features of an Islamic 
awakening in Chad. 
<H5>  KORAN RADIO TO TRANSMIT 24 HOURS PER DAY </H5>
  A 50-word report by Mamduh al-'Ashri on page one cites 
Information Minister Muhammad Safwat al-Sharif ordering an 
extension of the Koran radio's transmission to 24 hours a day 
throughout the year, effective 31 May 1994. 
  Commenting on the decision in a 200-word article on page 18, 
Mamduh al-'Ashri thanks the information minister and urges him 
to instruct the television's management to broadcast religious 
programs at suitable times so as to serve Islam and spread the 
right religious awareness.

  [Text] About 150 Palestinian policemen crossed into the 
Gaza Strip from Egypt this evening. They were the first group 
to enter Gaza under the Israel-PLO agreement signed in Cairo 
last week. Thousands of Palestinians gathered in Rafah to greet 
the policemen, who drove across the border in buses and U.S. 
donated military vehicles. They are headed for Dayr al-Balah, 
where they will be stationed in the present Civil Administration 
building. They were wearing olive-green uniforms and berets, 
and waved Palestinian flags. 
  Qol Yisra'el's correspondent on the spot reports that there 
is much excitement among the local population seeing the first 
sign of the transfer of power. Before their arrival, the new 
Palestinian police commander in Gaza, Nasr Yusuf, held a joint 
news conference with the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] Brigadier 
General Yom-Tov Sami'. Yusuf called it a historic day for the 
Palestinian people; the first day on the road to their 
independence. And, he added, we hope to have good relations 
with all our neighbors. 
  Earlier today, Israeli officials began handing over offices 
and supplies to Palestinian officials in Jericho. It was the 
start of a two-day handover. The actual transfer of power is to 
take place on Thursday [12 May]. The entry of Palestinian 
police into Jericho is expected tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Interview With Brigadier General Isma'il Jabr, Palestinian </F>
commander of the Jericho area police, by Salim 'Ali Dhiyab in 
the Jordan valley on 10 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Jabr] The crossing of Palestinian police to 
Jericho was to have taken place today. A previously scheduled 
meeting was held today with the Israeli side with the objective 
of setting the crossing into motion. However, the Israeli side 
said it could not let the entry of the Palestinian police force 
go ahead, citing political reasons. However, we managed to 
smooth over some snags holding up the entry. For our part, we 
informed them we were poised to crossing at the very moment we 
were holding talks with them. 
  [Dhiyab] What were the most important points you agreed on 
in your talks with the Israeli side? 
  [Jabr] The Israeli side said it would refer to its command 
for clearance to start the crossing. As I have said, we told 
them we were ready to move as of yesterday.

  [Text] Jerusalem -- A press release issued yesterday by 
Orient House [PLO headquarters in Jerusalem] says: The Israeli 
authorities continue to pursue the fait accompli policy toward 
Arab Jerusalem by reinforcing a series of practices aimed at 
enhancing a growing settlement reality in the city at the 
expense of the Arab presence. These authorities are trying to 
exploit the so-called (Jerusalem day) to affirm these settlement 
measures through statements that try to turn facts upside down 
and ignore the reality on the ground. 
  Naturally, (Jerusalem day), which the Israelis celebrate, 
means nothing to us other than an occasion for repeating 
rejected Israeli positions that contradict the substance of the 
peace process, based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 
and Resolution 252 issued on 21 May 1968. This resolution 
affirmed the international community's rejection of Israeli 
measures in Jerusalem and considered the city to be an integral 
part of the occupied territories. 
  It has become obvious even to the Israelis themselves that 
the political, social, and cultural reality which Jerusalem has 
experienced during 27 years of occupation affirms the failure of 
all Israeli attempts to unify and Judaize Jerusalem and 
integrate its Arab residents. The few meters separating Arab 
Jerusalem from West Jerusalem embody a vast distance as large as 
the one separating myth from reality and unfounded historic 
claims based on the principle of force from the brilliant 
historic reality that affirms the Arab and Islamic character of 
Jerusalem and the beating heart that it represents to the 
Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic nation. 
  The Palestinian side's commitment to the peace process and 
the ensuing phased agreements necessarily obligates the Israeli 
side to abide by the principles, steps, and measures relating to 
the interim and final stages. It should stop the unilateral 
Israeli measures that are liable to prejudice Palestinian 
rights, especially those pertaining to Jerusalem, when the final 
talks are launched. Jerusalem will be a top priority of those 
talks as the political and historic capital of the future 
Palestinian state.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 May (MENA)--Zuhdi al-Qidrah, Palestinian 
ambassador and Fatah representative in Cairo, has praised the 
role played by President Mubarak and the Egyptian leadership and 
their great efforts to make the peace process a success. In a 
statement to MENA, he said that the Arab Republic of Egypt, led 
by President Mubarak, is making available all its resources to 
help implement the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and enable the 
Palestinian people, led by the PLO, to regain their rights and 
build their independent state. 
  Responding to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 
statement on the return of refugees, al-Qidrah said that the 
statement has nothing to do with reality, as the Oslo agreement 
expressly provides for the return of the refugees of 1967 and 
later refugees to their homeland. He pointed out that the task 
of the quadripartite committee according to an agreement among 
Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, and Israel is to coordinate the 
process of the refugees' return and not to discuss the principle 
of their return.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director </F>
general of the Palestinian Economic Council for Reconstruction 
and Development; place not given; by Ziyad Halabi, in the 
studio, on 4 May -- recorded] 
  [Halabi] Good evening, Mr. Hasan Abu-Libdah. 
  [Abu-Libdah] Good evening to you. 
  [Halabi] After yesterday's signing of the 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement, we thought it would take 
immediate effect, but this has not happened. Why? 
  [Abu-Libdah] There is more to the matter than mechanics. 
Logistical and technical requirements must be secured before any 
kind of meaningful implementation takes place. 
  [Halabi] Can you elaborate on the impediments that seem to 
be holding up immediate implementation? 
  [Abu-Libdah] We have been discussing security and political 
considerations with the Israelis. Logistically and technically, 
we need to make sure, in the relatively short time we have 
before the transfer of power, that we familiarize ourselves with 
the inner workings of the system. Let's not forget that over 
the past 27 years, the majority of the departments whose control 
will devolve to us have been under near total Israeli control. 
Whereas until now we have been marginally and peripherally 
involved in the running of things, we now find we have to 
administer things ourselves. It is, therefore, natural that 
there are obstacles to a successful administration. I hope, 
however, that the transfer of power will take place relatively 
smoothly. 
  [Halabi] Are you attributing the delay to a lack of 
practical Palestinian experience? 
  [Abu-Libdah] Very much so. It is no secret that, despite 
the fact that several thousand Palestinians have staffed various 
departments of the Civil Administration in the occupied 
territories, they did not hold top managerial positions. The 
challenge for the Palestinians who will staff the civilian 
departments that will become the backbone of the self-rule 
authority is to take over as managers and legislators. We have 
ahead of us a tough challenge, which we think we will eventually 
tackle successfully. 
  [Halabi] What about the time challenge? Is three months 
enough before the agreement is implemented and the Palestinians 
take over? 
  [Abu-Libdah] In my opinion, the transfer of power will take 
a long time. The mechanical transfer should not take more than 
three to four weeks. However, in my opinion, the departments in 
which there will be a transfer of power cannot be properly 
described as Palestinian before certain conditions are met. One 
of these is a structure devised from a Palestinian perspective. 
It will take some time before it will be possible to describe 
the government agencies as 100 percent Palestinian in form and 
content. However, the mechanical transfer of power and the 
institution of new agencies should not take that long. I think 
the PLO can handle an immediate transfer of power, but it seems 
the political leadership in Tunis has decided the transfer of 
power can wait for another three weeks -- not the three months 
that you have mentioned -- during which time certain logistical 
and technical hurdles will, hopefully, have been surmounted. 
  [Halabi] Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director general of 
the 
Palestinian Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development, 
thank you. 
  [Abu-Libdah] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, head of the </F>
PLO Economic Department and deputy chairman of the Palestinian 
Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development, by Rashid 
Khashanah in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Khashanah] What questions are included on the 
agenda of the Economic Council for Development and 
Reconstruction? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] Among the first questions which we have 
begun to discuss in the council's meeting is the basic code 
issue and the appointment of the heads of departments in view of 
the interviews which the experts committee conducted with the 
Palestinians nominated for these posts at the council's request 
in Amman in late March. 
  [Khashanah] Is it true that the problem between the PLO on 
the one hand and the United States and the World Bank on the 
other regarding the council's formation was solved at the recent 
Christopher-'Arafat meeting in Cairo? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] That is true. 
  [Khashanah] Did the agreement on the transfer of powers 
signed in Cairo by 'Arafat and Rabin fulfill the Palestinian 
leadership's expectations of the meeting? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] The important thing is for the agreement to 
fulfill the Palestinian people's aspiration to freedom and 
independence. That depends on our people's continuation of the 
struggle for the sake of their aims. Because the agreement in 
its present form does not achieve the necessary steps leading to 
an independent Palestinian state. However, I am confident that 
our people will struggle competently to regain their rights in 
full. 
  [Khashanah] How will the outstanding issues be resolved? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] Experience with Israel so far does not 
inspire optimism about an imminent solution to the outstanding 
issues. However, our determination to achieve what we have not 
yet agreed upon at this stage is the means to recover our 
rights. [passage omitted] 
  [Khashanah] To what extent does the economic accord signed 
in Paris between the PLO and Israel sever the linkage between 
the Palestinian and Israeli economies? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] The accord reduces the chances of severing 
the linkage and perpetuates Israel's control over the 
Palestinian economy. The preamble stipulates that "the two 
sides should continue to cooperate in the economic sphere in 
order to establish a sound economic foundation on which joint 
relations would develop" -- which conflicts with our basic aim 
of building an economy free from the subservience imposed by 
Israeli authorities during the occupation. I believe that the 
preamble should have stipulated that the Palestinian people have 
the right to establish their own independent national economy in 
accordance with the states' and peoples' economic charter 
endorsed by the United Nations and which guarantees "the 
peoples' right to build their own national economies away from 
any foreign intervention." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Palestinian negotiator Jamil al-Tarifi says the 
Palestine National Authority has signed new temporary contracts 
with the Israeli water, electricity, and communications 
companies to continue their services in Gaza and Jericho until 
the PLO takes over. He says he expects the takeover to take 
place on 17 May. 
  According to al-Tarifi, the Palestinian authority has 
already 
signed contracts with large foreign companies to supply the 
self-rule areas with the services they need. A Canadian company 
will supply Gaza with 100 megawatts of electricity from a ship 
off the Gaza coast, and after two months, the company will 
double its supply. 
  Jericho will continue to receive electricity from Israel 
until an alternative becomes available. The Meqorot water 
company has also promised to continue supplying water until an 
alternative is found. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 7 May cites 
al-Tarifi as announcing that "a French company by the name of 
(Marbec) will supply the Strip with fuel and build a small oil 
refinery."]

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the APF on 4 May; place not </F>
given -- recorded, read by announcer] 
  [Text] In the name of the God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. A political statement released by the Alliance 
of Palestinian Forces [APF]: 
  The APF's Central Command has convened a meeting to study 
the 
dangers of the agreement signed in Cairo between 'Arafat -- who 
has, along with his team, switched over to the camp of the 
enemies of the people and the revolution -- and Rabin, the prime 
minister of the Zionist entity, in the Cairo circus, with the 
Americans playing the role of sponsors and the Egyptians playing 
the role of middleman. 
  The APF's Central Command decided to expose the risks the 
agreement carries for the rights of our people to liberation, 
repatriation, self-determination, and national independence. 
  The APF's Central Command would like to make the following 
points: 
  This agreement of capitulation is little more than a 
reorganization of occupation and redeployment of the occupying 
military along the borders with Egypt and Jordan, the crossings, 
road junctures, and the security arrangements around the Zionist 
settlements. Thus, the agreement amounts to a complete 
capitulation to U.S.-Zionist terms, turning Gaza and Jericho 
into discrete crossings and cantons. 
  This agreement blatantly ignores Jerusalem, the capital of 
Palestine, as well as the Palestinian refugees and their right 
to return to their homeland, leaving them vulnerable to 
resettlement in the host countries and in the diaspora. 
  This agreement ignores thousands of Palestinian expellees 
and 
prisoners and detainees who are being held in the prisons of the 
occupation authority. The agreement of liquidation approaches 
their case selectively, providing the release of several hundred 
detainees, whose prison terms had either nearly or completely 
expired. 
  This agreement sets out to tear asunder the land and people 
and marks a dangerous gateway for the Zionist penetration of our 
Arab nation and people with a view to controlling their 
resources through a plan of normalized relations, which has 
already begun in certain Arab capitals. 
  Driven by our concern for the supreme Palestinian interests, 
and in the name of the Palestinian Arab people and the Arab and 
Muslim nations and world public opinion, the alliance announces 
the following: 
  First, this agreement of liquidation is null and void and is 
binding neither on the Palestinian people, nor on the Arab and 
Islamic masses. The signers of the agreement do not speak for 
the Palestinian people. Accordingly, we urge our Palestinian 
and Arab masses to take a determined stand against this 
U.S.-Zionist-'Arafatist conspiracy being peddled by certain Arab 
governments, led by the Camp David regime. 
  Second, the APF reiterates its determination to maintain the 
struggle and thwart the implementation of this agreement. It 
calls on the Palestinian and Arab masses to boycott the 
self-rule institutions and defy all their decisions, including a 
boycott of the elections. The APF further calls for ostracizing 
and besieging the self-rule clique as a tool of repression 
manipulated by occupation, as envisaged in the ominous agreement. 
  We urge our Arab and Islamic masses and the patriotic 
governments and world public opinion to stand by the Palestinian 
people's struggle and support them as they fight to topple the 
agreement. We call on them to boycott and refuse to have 
anything to do with the self-rule institutions and agencies as a 
confirmation of our people's cohesion with the Arab and Islamic 
nations. 
  Third, the alliance reiterates a commitment to the 
continuation, escalation, and enhancement of the valiant 
intifadah. It also pledges to secure whatever is necessary to 
ensure the continued dynamism of the intifadah until the 
national goals of our people are attained. 
  Fourth, what 'Arafat and his team have done in signing the 
agreement with the Zionist enemy in Cairo amounts to treason 
against the nation, the liquidation of the Palestinian cause, 
and the disposal of the PLO. The APF reiterates its adherence 
to the PL0 as a national achievement and demands that its 
institutions be rebuilt on democratic foundations. 
  The APF extends greetings to our people who have renounced 
this agreement by declaring the signing day a day of national 
strike and national mourning. The alliance hails our people's 
valiant intifadah as it confronts occupation, and urges them to 
close ranks and upgrade their militant, mass action inside and 
outside the occupied territory with the objective of toppling 
the agreement of humiliation and disgrace and realizing the 
aspirations of the Palestinian people. It calls for 15 May, 
1994 -- the anniversary of the theft of Palestine -- to be 
observed as a day of sweeping anger in the homeland and in the 
diaspora.

  [Text] The Central Command of the Alliance of Palestinian 
Forces [APF] has been meeting since 1800 [1500 GMT] today at the 
Martyr Samir Darwish Hall in the al-Khalisah building of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command 
[PFLP-GC] in the al-Yarmuk Camp in Damascus in order to discuss 
the situation of the sons of our Palestinian people in Lebanon 
and the diaspora and confront the conspiracy represented by the 
'Arafat-Rabin agreement signed recently in Cairo. 
  Ahmad Jibril, PFLP-GC secretary general, said in a statement 
before the meeting: As Palestinian alliance forces, we will 
discuss in this and other meetings the extent of the serious 
impact of the treasonous 'Arafat-Rabin agreement on four million 
Palestinians in the diaspora and on their future. 
  Jibril asserted that there are multiparty conspiracies to 
dismiss the issue of the land with regard to millions of 
Palestinians in the diaspora. There are also plans to evict the 
Palestinians in Lebanon to states that are far away from 
Palestine such as Latin and North America. 
  Jibril added: Here, I would like to clearly say that the 
Palestinians in the diaspora were basically the backbone of the 
Palestinian revolution and offered great sacrifices throughout 
the past 30 years. Through the Cairo agreement, we now see that 
those who signed it want to completely destroy the future of the 
Palestinian sons in the diaspora. 
  Jibril asserted that the APF is looking into ways to 
confront 
the treasonous Oslo agreement in and outside the occupied 
territories. 
  George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for 
the 
Liberation of Palestine, also made a statement in which he 
asserted that the aim of the APF meeting is to discuss the 
threats the Oslo-Cairo agreement poses against our people in 
Lebanon and the dangers facing them, represented by forcing 
settlement and displacement on them. 
  On the escalation of the heroic Palestinian intifadah, 
Habash 
said that the APF will work to escalate the intidafah because 
what happened in Gaza and Jericho is not a withdrawal but a 
redeployment of the Zionist enemy forces. 
  Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine, made a statement in which he 
said that this meeting with Palestinian leaders stationed on 
Lebanese territory is to discuss basically the bitter harvest of 
the Oslo-Cairo agreement, which is now raising its ugly head in 
Lebanon, and its threats to the fate of our Palestinian people 
in this Arab country. 
  Hawatimah asserted that the Palestinian people in the 
diaspora are the losers in the Cairo agreement because they are 
completely excluded. The right of self-determination for the 
people at home has been eliminated. Therefore, the APF in the 4 
May meeting, dealt with the problems at home and the self-rule 
in light of the practical application of the Cairo agreement. 
Today, the entire meeting is devoted to how to contain the 
Oslo-Cairo agreement's threats against our people abroad.

  [Text] A military spokesman for the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine--General Command [PFLP-GC] has stated 
the following: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate: 
  Military communique: 
  In confirmation of the threats that Clinton has made to 
those 
who oppose the 'Arafat-Rabin agreement and after the ceremony of 
selling and liquidating our people's rights and cause, 
represented by the agreement signed by 'Arafat and Rabin in 
Cairo on the 4th of this month, the outlines of this agreement 
and its secret annexes have started to be translated into 
actions on the ground against the positions of the strugglers. 
  At 1200 today, 10 May 1994, squadrons of the Zionist-U.S. 
enemy aircraft carried out several barbaric raids on PFLP-GC 
institutions that provide humanitarian, medical, and other 
services in the al-Na'imah area south of Beirut. The enemy 
aircraft carried out six raids over a period of two hours on 
these positions, hurling tonnes of their hatred and destruction. 
The Zionist aircraft continue to overfly the area. 
  The military spokesman continued: We in the PFLP-GC view 
this Zionist aggression as an extension of the Hebron massacre 
and the policy of killing and terrorism that the U.S. peace 
brings with it and which pursues its open war against our 
people's aspirations and rights and seeks to undermine the 
morale of the mujahdin who struggle to regain their rights. 
  As for our losses, they are limited and minor. We will issue 
a communique later as the situation and needs dictate. 
  The military spokesman added: It is important for us in the 
PFLP-GC to emphasize to the masses of our nation and people that 
our political stand and struggle will continue in spite of what 
is being concocted against our rights, against our people, and 
against our nation. We are confident about achieving inevitable 
victory. The Zionist-U.S. policy of terrorism will not separate 
us from our cause. We pledge to pursue the revolution until the 
liberation of land and man. 
  [Signed] The Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command

<F P=106> ["Military Communique No. 2" issued by the PFLP-GC on 10 May] </F>
  [Text] Further to the first military communique issued by 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command [PFLP-GC], on the air raids launched by the Zionist 
enemy aircraft against the PFLP-GC's social and humanitarian 
institutions at 1200 today, 10 May 1994, the PFLP-GC military 
spokesman has stated the following: 
  The Zionist enemy aircraft have continued their terrorist 
raids against the positions mentioned in the previous 
communique, having failed to inflict the losses they had planned 
to inflict. 
  In an attempt to spread panic among secure civilians and 
draw 
attention to its suspect aims; on the pretext of talking about 
military posts in populated civilian areas; and in 
implementation of the policy of confronting all those who oppose 
the agreements that seek to liquidate our Palestinian cause, the 
Zionist enemy aircraft have launched new raids at 1720 today, 
thus raising the total number of raids to 11. 
  As usual, the Zionist enemy has claimed that it has 
inflicted 
casualties within the ranks of the PFLP-GC. This was reported 
by other news media. 
  We in the PFLP-GC deny sustaining any casualties within the 
ranks of our fighters. We reassert that the locations targeted 
by the air raids are civilian institutions that provide free 
humanitarian aid. 
  We stress that the Zionist political and military raids will 
not prevent us from sticking to our objectives and jihad 
positions and our confrontation of the conspiracy of surrender. 
  We pledge to pursue the march until the liberation of land 
and man. 
  [Signed] The Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command

  [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[PFLP] has claimed responsibility for the attack on an Israeli 
bus near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. A statement signed 
by the vanguards of comrade martyr Wadi' Haddad was distributed 
in the occupied Palestinian territories today. The statement 
says that in continuation of the policy of revolutionary 
violence and armed militancy, the Ibrahim al-Ra'i group has 
attacked an Israeli bus carrying Zionist settlers. 
  In reference to the Palestinian self-rule agreement, the 
statement says that agreements will not protect the usurpers of 
our territories and displacers of our people.

  [Text] Jerusalem, May 8 (AFP) -- A majority of 
Palestinians in the occupied territories believe their refugee 
camps should remain in place until a final settlement is reached 
with the Israelis, a survey published Sunday [8 May] showed. 
  More than 58 percent favoured maintaining the 27 refugee 
camps over the scheduled five-year interim period of autonomy, 
the Centre for Palestine Research and Studies found. 
  Half of those nonetheless wanted to see conditions improve 
in 
the overcrowded camps of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  However 39 percent preferred to transfer the 430,000 camp 
dwellers to new housing projects. The remainder voiced no 
opinion in the poll carried out by the Nablus-based centre. 
  About one million Palestinians are registered as refugees 
with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, but 60 percent 
live outside the camps. 
  The April 19 survey found that nearly 37.8 percent of 
Palestinians in the territories would vote for Yasir 'Arafat's 
mainstream PLO movement Fatah if elections were held to an 
autonomy council now. 
  In March, the centre's poll registered 36.4 percent support. 
  Backing for the Moslem fundamentalists was stable at about 
16 
percent in the latest survey, which questioned 2,006 
Palestinians and had a three percent margin of error.

<F P=106> [News conference by Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim </F>
Basindwah with unidentified correspondents in Cairo on 11 
May--recorded] 
  [Text] [Basindwah] I was honored a short time ago to meet 
His Excellency Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. The meeting 
was very positive. I explained what is happening in Yemen and 
assured him that we adhere to Yemen's unity. I conveyed a 
verbal message from his excellency's brother President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih. Events in Yemen are a confrontation of an 
attempt at rebellion by a group or faction from the leadership 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] that failed to realize that 
it should have adhered to constitutional legitimacy. It tried to 
defy this legitimacy and violate law and order. It triggered 
fighting, which is about to end in a day or even sooner, God 
willing. Then things will return to normal. I believe that the 
news coming out of Aden is false. The fighting now is going on 
around Aden, which is almost besieged. We pay no attention to 
what is being said and will let the results on the ground speak 
for themselves. 
  [Correspondent] Is your activity through diplomatic channels 
proof that the [words indistinct]? 
  [Basindwah] Naturally we give special importance to all our 
brothers, particularly President Husni Mubarak, the leader of 
the biggest Arab country. We have an obligation to inform them 
of what is happening in our country. But our eagerness to keep 
them informed does not mean that we are not sure of our ability 
to settle the issue within hours or in less than a day or two. 
Are we required to hide things from our brothers? If this is 
the case, then it is a different story. Telling our brothers 
what is going on does not mean that we are uncertain of our 
ability to settle the issue or that we think the fighting will 
go on long. This is not true. 
  [Correspondent] Do you suspect that some neighboring 
countries support the south? 
  [Basindwah] We do not suspect the impartiality of the Arab 
countries or that they are eager not to interfere in Yemeni 
affairs. Such accusations against any neighboring and fraternal 
states are rejected. 
  [Correspondent] Does the Yemeni Government still refuse any 
kind of mediation, be it Arab or otherwise? 
  [Basindwah] Of course we agree to an end to the bloodshed, 
providing that those who have defied constitutional legitimacy 
and law and order abide by the unity of Yemen and its 
Constitution and subject the troops that remain under their 
control to the authority of the legitimate leadership that 
represents constitutional legitimacy in Yemen. We will allow no 
organization to run militias or to control part of the Yemeni 
Armed Forces. 
  [Correspondent] Do you believe that war is the best way to 
maintain Yemen's unity? 
  [Basindwah] We have never believed that war is the best way 
to safeguard Yemen's unity. But this war has been imposed upon 
us. The war was not triggered by us, as a legitimate authority 
in Yemen, but by those who have violated law and order and 
constitutional legitimacy. Our consolation in confronting those 
outlaws who imposed a fight on us is God's saying: "Fighting is 
prescribed for you, ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye 
dislike a thing that is good for you, and that ye love a thing 
that is bad for you. But God knoweth and ye know not." [Koranic 
verse] 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] non-Yemeni elements 
involved in the fighting. Is this true? 
  [Basindwah] These are sheer lies and fabrication. The YSP 
leadership previously claimed that it captured a large group 
from the al-Jihad Organization in Abyan. When we ordered Aden 
Governor Salih Munassar to hand over these Egyptian elements 
from the al-Jihad Organization to the Egyptian consul in Aden, 
he refused to hand any over, perhaps because he had none in the 
first place. I tell the brothers in the YSP leadership to hand 
over to the Egyptian authorities any Egyptian group from the 
al-Jihad Organization that they may have. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Basindwah] This is not true. You may come and see the 
positions for yourselves. This is an attempt to turn the Arab 
states against us. These are lies and fabrication. We do not 
need to use Iraqis, Sudanese, or others. We are absolutely not 
short of men. 
  [Correspondent] To save the homeland could you.... 
  [Basindwah, interrupting] This is nonsense. Things have 
already been settled and are now in the final phase. 
  [Correspondent] Is President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih willing to 
negotiate with the YSP leadership? 
  [Basindwah] I believe that the elements in the YSP 
leadership 
who are responsible for triggering the rebellion and the war 
must give themselves up. They will be guaranteed a fair trial. 
Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 10 May (MENA)--Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first 
Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of the President's 
Office for Political Affairs, has stated the need to broaden the 
Middle East peace process to involve every track, particularly 
the Syrian-Israeli track. Dr. al-Baz pointed out that 
comprehensive and just peace will be achieved only if all these 
tracks are included. 
  Dr. al-Baz made these remarks during a meeting here today 
with a delegation of new heads of Israeli diplomatic missions to 
several countries, which is visiting Cairo. He stressed that 
Egypt is trying to overcome the obstacles obstructing the peace 
process, particularly along the Syrian-Israeli track. Dr. 
al-Baz explained to the delegation Egypt's position on various 
Arab, African, and international issues. 
  Israeli Ambassador in Cairo David Sultan said the Israeli 
diplomats wanted, before starting their new jobs abroad, to 
learn Egypt's views on the peace process in the region and the 
negotiations relating to this process. The ambassador noted 
that the delegation's visit to Egypt will last three days.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amr Nasif from Cairo] </F>
  [Text] For some time, Tel Aviv has anxiously been raising 
with Egyptian politicians an issue of considerable importance to 
it, that is, the picture the Egyptian opposition press draws of 
Israel and the Israeli personality. 
  The Zionist viewpoint can be summed up thus: The political 
line pursued by the Egyptian opposition in general, and by the 
Nasirists and Islamists in particular, is determined to tarnish 
the image of Israel and the Israelis in the eyes of Egyptians by 
pinning many dirty accusations on the Israelis to ruin Egypt's 
economic, social, and health relations with them. The 
consequences have gone beyond the Egyptian society to worldwide 
specialized research centers, which have tended recently to 
verify the charges made in Egypt against Israeli nationals. 
Some of these centers have approached official and nonofficial 
Egyptian sources, who confirmed some of these charges. 
  Making no effort to hide the negative impact this policy 
might have on the Israelis themselves in the long run, Tel Aviv 
has been pressing for invigorating the normalization process on 
the basis of new Israeli proposals. The major and most serious 
of these was a proposal to organize a series of intellectual 
meetings and debates involving two Egyptian and Israeli groups 
of researchers under 35 years of age. According to the 
proposal, the two groups would employ the outcome of these 
debates in studies and research which the mass media in both 
countries can publish to improve each side's image in the eyes 
of the public. 
  An Egyptian source has told AL-SAFIR that Cairo did not 
object to the Israeli proposal and that a debate involving 15 
researchers of each side was indeed held some time ago under the 
auspices of an Egyptian center, which the source referred to by 
the letters "M.E". The Egyptian side to the debate was 
supervised by a person referred to by the letters "A.F." The 
source added that the debate ended in utter failure. Although 
Egypt was careful not to select any fanatic or anti-Israeli 
researchers, all observers noted that the Egyptian researchers 
deliberately insulted the Israelis so much that one of the 
latter remarked: We are not war criminals to be treated with 
such disdain. 
  The source added that Egypt made calculations before and 
after the debate. Available information later confirmed that 
the Israeli researchers had undergone three weeks of intensive 
training in gathering intelligence and that Egypt decided to 
suspend the debates. 
  Instructions were later issued to prepare a file on "Israeli 
criminal conduct in Egypt." Several security and other 
organizations were involved in the report, which confirmed that 
Israeli apparatuses were engaged in an exhaustive process to 
inflict harm on Egypt--harm that can go as far as sabotage. 
  The report recommended a number of measures to confront 
organized Israeli crimes in Egypt. It recorded that Israelis 
are behind 77 percent of crimes involving forgery and drug and 
money smuggling. The report emphasized a special recommendation 
by the Egyptian Central Bank that stringent measures be applied 
by banks and money changers in checking and authenticating the 
currencies Israeli tourists exchange in Egypt. The report cited 
several major crimes that involved Israelis in Egypt. The 
following were among these crimes: 
  - An eight-member Israeli network led by Gadi Ya'aqov was 
caught in possession of $80,000 last January. Investigations 
showed that the network was operating under the command of a 
former Israeli army general named Binyamin 'Ezer. The network 
members succeeded in smuggling large amounts of counterfeit 
money between September and January 1993 with the help of some 
collaborators. 
  -A network to smuggle counterfeit currencies has been 
caught. It operated under the command of Chaim Ben-Aharon, an 
employee in the security section of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo. 
  - A scheme to smuggle $10 million to Egypt through a network 
led by Chaim Eli'ezer with the assistance of former Israeli army 
officers, three tourist guides, and tour-bus drivers working for 
Eagle Tours was aborted in 1993. 
  - Case No. 318/1993, which involved Rufa'il Bitar, who was 
caught in possession of counterfeit sums worth $7,000; 5,000 
pounds sterling; and 20,000 dinars. 
  - Case No. 517/1994 from Ismailia, a felony in which Shalom 
Mitan was caught trying to smuggle one kilogram of heroin and 
counterfeit $3,000 which he planned to deliver to a merchant in 
the jewelry market. 
  - Case No. 2187, in which 'Adli Avraham was caught trying to 
change counterfeit $5,000 at Misr Bank in the Mena House Hotel. 
Avraham was almost a permanent resident in Cairo, under the 
pretext of preparing a master's degree in pharaonic history. 
Criminology laboratory tests confirmed that these currencies 
were identical with those which Chaim Eli'ezer had tried to 
smuggle in terms of the material and method of counterfeiting. 
  - Case No. 397/1994, in which Frois Tekfu, Sahar Rosan, and 
the latter's girlfriend Violette Minshah tried to smuggle large 
amounts of counterfeit currencies. 
  - An attempt to smuggle large quantities of heroin in 
toothpaste tubes by Avraham Shalon, vice president of the 
Israeli Academic Center in Egypt, was aborted. 
  - An attempt by the assistant economic attache at the 
Israeli Embassy to smuggle heroin in the diplomatic pouch was 
aborted in January 1993. 
  - Several Israeli AIDS-infected women have been caught. 
Some of them confessed that it was their national duty to 
transfer AIDS to the largest number of Egyptians possible. 
  The report mentions many such cases, including a network 
that 
was caught by accident in the summer of 1993, when a boat 
carrying Israelis was involved in an accident. The passengers 
were rescued and taken to hospital, where tests showed that all 
the women passengers were AIDS carriers. Two of the passengers 
had been banned from entering Egypt, for being members of the 
AIDS club network uncovered in Egypt in the late 1980's. They 
confessed at that time that they transferred AIDS to three 
Egyptian young men, who tested HIV positive according to 
internist Sabbur. 
  It is appropriate to commend the vigilance of the Egyptian 
security authorities vis-a-vis the Zionist sabotage schemes. 
However, is it not equally appropriate to ask why Egypt has 
refrained from taking firm and decisive measures against the 
Israeli presence in Egypt? Moreover, what is the nature of the 
agreements signed between Egypt and Israel, by which Egypt 
contents itself with extraditing some Israeli saboteurs, or 
trying some of them in utter secrecy? If the solid security 
rule says that the maximum success in crime prevention does not 
exceed 40 percent, what is more likely to succeed is 60 percent 
of these sabotage operations. The people who pay the price for 
these operations are the citizens, who were insulted by 
Agriculture Minister Yusuf Wali when he said two months ago "if 
it were not for Israel, Egypt would not have known the taste of 
bananas or apples." The country's economy as well is paying the 
price; Israel exhausts that economy and the government takes 
revenge from the public sector.

  [Text] Cairo, May 10 (AFP)--A senior Egyptian opposition MP 
on Tuesday accused unnamed government officials of ordering the 
killing of a Muslim fundamentalist lawyer because he tried to 
negotiate an end to clashes between Islamic militants and the 
security forces. 
  Kamal Khalid, a lawyer and independent member of parliament, 
said 'Abd-al-Harith Madani died after having tried to give him 
proposals for ending the conflict between the outlawed 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah and security forces which has cost 
nearly 400 lives in the past two years. 
  "Certain circles in the security forces are trying to stir 
up" the violence, Khalid told a lawyers' union meeting in the 
centre of Cairo, called to protest over the alleged killing of 
Madani by security forces. 
  The Order of Cairo Lawyers said Monday that Madani, who 
defended the al-Jama'ah's spiritual leader, was tortured to 
death a week after he was arrested. 
  Madani was a leading member of the defence committee set up 
for al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) spiritual guide 
Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, who was sentenced to seven years in 
jail by the state security court last week. 
The al-Jama'ah has been waging a bloody two-year campaign to 
topple the secular government of President Husni Mubarak. 
  In a message to Mubarak, Order of Cairo Lawyers President 
'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad said there were "circles in the heart of 
your government who do not want stability in Egypt." 
  The Cairo lawyers' statement said Madani was arrested on 
April 26 and taken to a secret destination. "Not even his 
family knew where he was. They only heard about his death on 
Friday." 
  The lawyers said they were "horrified" by Madani's death, 
describing it as "an act of aggression against all lawyers." 
  Security forces arrested Madani during a four-hour search of 
his office, in the presence of four colleagues. 
  The 40-year-old lawyer from Qina in northern [as received] 
Egypt was married with two daughters.

<F P=106> [Article by Salah-al-Din Hafiz] </F>
  [Excerpt] Despite the serious, negative effects that 
extremism, violence, and terrorism have left on our public life 
and inevitably on our private life, this violence and terrorism 
had one good effect, if one may say so. 
  The good thing was that the tragedy produced by extremism, 
terrorism, and violence has made everyone realize that the issue 
is not only the result of religious or ideological deviation or 
incitement by foreign countries and forces that do not like to 
see us enjoying stability and progress, but that the origin and 
roots of the problem have something to do with the social and 
economic situation in which we live and from which we suffer. 
We sometimes deny the existence of the problem and sometimes 
we do not read and interpret it correctly, claiming that 
everything is fine and nothing better could be done. But the 
bitter truth remains, does not disappear, and does not change in 
the eyes of those who really are afraid for the future of the 
country and the nation. 
  I say very humbly that we have frequently drawn attention to 
the fact that violence, extremism, and terrorism would not have 
broken out, grown strong, and spread had they not found the 
proper environment and fertile ground among the unemployed, the 
poor, the frustrated, the desperate, and people without hope who 
are ready to dismiss this society which did not provide them 
with work, housing, clothing, and hope for the future, as is 
necessary. 
  We have often attacked the inciters, provokers, and liars, 
claiming that extremism and terrorism are imported commodities 
that have no basis in our society and we have pursued a policy 
of concealment and deception until one day we woke up to the 
sound of explosions and this terrifying bloody clash. We now 
follow the deterioration of the situation with concern. 
  At any rate, thank God that we have awakened after a long 
sleep, distractions, plays on words and slogans, and deception 
in interpretations and justifications to place our fingers on 
the cause of the disease. It is clear that the problem is due 
to the existing social and economic inequality that has created 
sharp divisions among the people, disturbed the structure of 
society that has been maintained over the ages, and produced 
abnormal conditions, values, and traditions that respect money 
more than intellect, sanctify wealth more than work, and 
exercise deception more than ethics. The result has been social 
division and economic disparity that have no logical basis.

<F P=106> [Report by Umaymah 'Abd-al-Latif: "Controversial Conference </F>
Moves to Cyprus"] 
  [Text] In a last-minute change, the organisers of a 
forthcoming conference on the ethnic and religious minorities of 
the Middle East decided to shift the parley to Cyprus after it 
triggered opposition from the bulk of Egyptian 
intellectuals--both Christian and Muslim. 
  "We have decided that we cannot work under pernicious 
conditions and make this conference a success," Sulayman Shafiq, 
a member of staff at the Ibn-Khuldun Centre organising the 
conference, told AL-AHRAM WEEKLY. 
  The conference, scheduled to take place between 12-14 May, 
first came under fire from the renowned political analyst and 
writer Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal for including on its agenda a 
discussion of the problems of Copts in Egypt. 
  Other intellectuals followed suit, and Pope Shanudah III of 
the Coptic Orthodox Church issued a statement in which he 
rejected the designation of Copts as a minority and insisted 
that they were part and parcel of the Egyptian nation. 
  "We have striven to hold this conference, which deals 
specifically with the Middle East and the Arab world, in Egypt 
in order to acknowledge its regional role and to challenge any 
misconceptions about domestic security," Shafiq said. 
  But, he added, organisers had to reconsider and decided to 
move the conference to "another country where freedom of 
expression does not come under severe attack". 
  Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi, head of the Shura [Consultative] 
Council, was quoted on Monday as saying the state opposed the 
convening of the conference on Egyptian soil because Copts and 
Muslims make up one nation, share the same history and coexist. 
  But Shafiq denied that the organisers were aware of any 
government objection. "We have not been informed of any 
governmental opposition to holding the conference," Shafiq said. 
  Shafiq disclosed that even before the storm was triggered 
the 
organisers had considered a number of alternative 
host-countries. Cyprus was a strong option and Lebanon also 
offered to play host. 
  "We chose Egypt because we wanted to challenge the image 
that 
is being projected of Egypt as an unsafe country," he said. 
"But it seems that intellectual terrorism is much more powerful 
than armed terrorism." 
  State Councellor Sulayman Qiladah thinks the decision to 
move 
the conference reflects the success of Egyptian public opinion 
in rejecting a gathering that includes on its agenda the 
possibility of international interference in the region under 
the guise of protecting minority rights. 
  "This is a major achievement of the unified stand made by 
all 
Egyptians who refused to discuss a topic that should only be 
discussed within an Egyptian framework," he said. "The good 
thing about this conference is that it showed how strong our 
national unity could be at times of crisis." 
  Shafiq said the Egyptian delegation to the conference will 
be 
made up of 20 prominent personalities, including Dr Mahmud 
Hafiq, head of the Shura Council's services committee, Prof. 
Mahmud al-Juhari, president of Hilwan University, Jihad 'Udah a 
political analyst, and seven Coptic figures led by Dr Wasim 
al-Sisi. 
  A discussion of Coptic "problems" is still on the agenda but 
Shafiq was not sure whether it would actually take place. 
  Fahmi Huwaydi, a writer on Islamic issues who turned down 
an invitation to attend the conference, said that shifting the 
conference from Cairo to Cyprus will not solve the complicated 
problems of Middle Eastern minorities. 
  "The conference remains a defence of the minorities' cause 
more than a serious and true attempt to put an end to their 
grievances and problems," he said. "The situation of the 
minorities is far too complicated to be discussed through such a 
modest institution as the Ibn-Khuldun Centre." 
  Another writer on Islamic affairs, president of al-Zaqaziq 
University Dr Muhammad 'Imarah, expressed dissatisfaction with 
the removal of the conference from Egyptian territory. He said 
that certain lines should not be crossed or even approached by 
research centres and this conference seems to have gone far 
beyond these lines. It was time, he said, that it was stopped. 
  "Now it is not, as some would claim, the freedom of 
expression and thought we should protect; it is a whole nation 
that should be protected, before they divide it into minorities 
and majorities and produce a climate ripe for sectarian strife," 
'Imarah said. 
  Huwaydi pointed out that the topic was first studied in the 
'70s by the Arabic Studies Centre of which Sa'd al-Din Ibrahim, 
the chairman of the Ibn-Khuldun Centre, was also a member. 
  "This centre had its effective presence in the Arab world at 
the time and had no connections with any foreign 
associations--which could cast doubts on the credibility of any 
institution." 
  A side-result of the controversy was the resignation of 
Jamal 
Badawi, editor-in-chief of the newspaper AL-WAFD, after Wafd 
Party Chairman Fu'ad Saraj-al-Din gave last minute orders to 
lift Haykal's article lambasting the conference. 
  Shadin Shihab reports, however, that Badawi appears ready to 
withdraw his resignation. "The problem between Badawi and Fu'ad 
Pasha has been resolved and I am very optimistic that Badawi 
will resume the functions of his post very soon," Yasin 
Saraj-al-Din, leading Wafd member and brother to the party 
leader, told AL-AHRAM WEEKLY. He said that if Badawi 
contributed his weekly article for publication, "then we must 
conclude that the problem has dissolved into thin air". 
Badawi's name continues to appear on the newspaper's masthead 
despite the reported resignation. 
  Yasin Saraj-al-Din explained that Badawi had given him, and 
not Fu'ad Saraj-al-Din, his letter of resignation which was to 
be passed on to the party leader. "I am the closest person to 
both of them and Badawi found it too embarrassing because of his 
great respect for the Pasha," Saraj-al-Din said. "I never gave 
the letter to the Pasha. It is still in my pocket. I decided 
to resolve the dispute and not to widen it further."

  [Text] Cairo, 10 May (MENA)--Finance Minister Dr. Muhammad 
al-Razzaz delivered a statement on the state's draft general 
budget for the fiscal year 1994-95 at the People's Assembly at 
noon today. 
  He said the draft budget is based on several principles, 
foremost of which is the continuation of the fiscal policies 
leading to a gradual decrease in the state's general budget 
deficit and the focus on social issues. 
  The plan also pays attention to enhancing the economic 
dimension through an integrated group of investment, monetary, 
credit, and fiscal policies that seek to develop the state's 
revenues, secure the necessary investment for development and 
production, enhance the infrastructure, encourage the private 
sector, and take care of production, as well as taking into 
consideration current world economic changes. 
  He said that the total expenditure in the draft budget of 
the 
year 1994-95 amounts to approximately 70.541 billion pounds 
against 65.313 billion pounds in the 1993-94 budget. 
  The total revenue is 61.977 billion pounds against 56.33 
billion pounds last year. Thus the budget's total deficit is 
approximately 8.564 billion pounds against 8.983 billion in the 
1993-94 budget. 
  He added that financing through local and foreign loans 
amounts to about 8.75 billion pounds and thus the net deficit in 
the new budget amounts to approximately 488.4 million pounds 
against 1.338 billion in the year 1993-94. 
  Al-Razzaz said in his statement that the general taxes are 
estimated at 16.244 billion pounds representing 44 percent of 
the state's total revenue. 
  He noted that payment of the state loans on time is a 
paramount goal of our fiscal policy. Therefore, each fiscal 
year assumes its own share of the debt service. The draft 
budget allocates 21.146 billion pounds to meet the interest and 
installments of the state's local and foreign loans. He said 
the interest of these loans amounts to approximately 17.74 
billion pounds, of which only 4.1 billion is foreign loans and 
the rest local loans. 
  The value of local and foreign installments due in 1994-95 
is 
about 4.271 billion pounds, of which 2.33 billion are foreign 
loan installments.

foreign affairs, has described his visits to Namibia, Botswana, 
and Zimbabwe as successful. [passage omitted] 
  Ambassador 'Umar Yusuf Baridu, the first under secretary in 
the Foreign Ministry, speaking from the ministry's forum, 
stressed Sudan's support for the Yemeni people's unity. He said 
the continuing struggle between north and south Yemen served 
neither the interests of Yemenis nor those of the Arab world, 
which was under provocation from global imperialism. Ambassador 
Baridu expressed the hope that the sons of united Yemen would 
sit together round the negotiating table and resolve their 
internal problems without foreign interference. [passage

  [Text] Ambassador 'Umar Yusuf Baridu, the first under 
secretary of the Foreign Ministry, has denied reports carried by 
some news agencies and media organs on Sudanese troops taking 
part in the ongoing war in Yemen. He added that the propagation 
of such allegations may be aimed at widening the scope of the 
war using it as a pretext for foreign intervention in the 
ongoing conflict in Yemen. Ambassador Baridu reaffirmed Sudan's 
principled attitude toward what was taking place in fraternal 
Yemen as exemplified by Sudan's eagerness to see the crisis 
approached within a Yemeni context. He said Sudan's position 
was based on clear and specific principles, including 
noninterference in the internal affairs of states and commitment 
to the charters of the United Nations, OAU, and the Arab League.

  [Text] Baghdad, 8 May (INA) -- Under the headline "A 
Viewpoint on Yemen's Events", the newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH 
published an editorial today. It says: No one imagined that 
matters would lead to a war in this way, as if the war was 
taking place among enemies, when they are, in fact, brothers. 
  In its editorial today by Barzan al-Tikriti, the newspaper 
adds: Just as the majority [words indistinct] the declaration of 
unity, this saddening and painful event was not expected to take 
place between brothers in the way we see and hear from the mass 
media. 
  The writer explained in his article that what is taking 
place 
could be viewed as a result of a relationship between two 
contradictory regimes that were placed within a framework of 
unity about which many people seeking or opposing the concept of 
unity voiced their doubts. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH points out in its editorial that what has 
caused the all-out war is that some people view the concept of 
unity as something that should be complete, or should lead to a 
destructive, all-out war as the only alternative. This is, of 
course, wrong in the view of everyone who honestly wants unity 
  The editorial says that in order to make unity true and to 
guarantee it, the people should, before the leaders and 
officials, believe in it, understand it, and adhere to it. 
This, the newspaper says, will prevent differences among 
officials from affecting, threatening, and undermining unity.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party National </F>
Command on 8 May; place not given] 
  [Text] Sons of our glorious Arab nation; sons of unified, 
struggling, ancient Yemen: Four years ago, in May 1990, our 
Arab nation received the declaration of the unity of the two 
parts of Yemen -- a serious, sound step -- with overwhelming joy 
and optimism that the unity of Yemen would support the pan-Arab 
struggle and be another addition to its major achievements: the 
struggling intifadah in Palestine and the principles of the 
Mother of Battles following the great confrontation. 
  The nation pinned high hopes on this unionist step because 
it 
rested on genuine popular and national support. The nation also 
took pride in the struggle of the sons of this time-honored part 
of the greater homeland in order to regain the unity of their 
homeland and bring about a new, happy birth to Yemen that would 
rid Yemen of the traces of the divisions that distorted its 
national and pan-Arab character. The nation also viewed with 
high appreciation the readiness demonstrated at the time to rise 
to the level of historic action that, alone, is enough to 
guarantee the soundness and success of any unionist step. 
  The climate was favorable for this unity to proceed amid 
national and pan-Arab challenges, equipped with popular will and 
determination to overcome difficulties that could obstruct its 
march to build a unified, prosperous Yemen that serves pan-Arab 
interests. This step came in response to objective needs and 
aspirations cherished by everybody to transcend long decades of 
loss and foreign colonialism and influence. These aspirations 
were supported by popular will and determination to rebuild the 
political, social, economic, and cultural life in a manner that 
ensured promoting unity, overcoming backwardness, and making use 
of the lessons of previous unity attempts. This was meant to 
immunize the new step against the dangers of the return of 
personal whims and interests that represented fragmentation and 
backwardness and were the main cause for fragmentation on the 
level of the Arab nation. 
  Great and intensive intellectual and practical efforts were 
exerted to enhance the foundations of Yemeni unity so that it 
would derive motivation from the national and pan-Arab spirit of 
the people of Yemen to develop, succeed, and express the 
readiness of the sons of this people to defend it with all that 
is precious to them. 
  However, the remnants of the mentality of fragmentation and 
its interests, as well as the external forces of intervention, 
have played a role in obstructing well-meaning efforts and in 
sowing the seeds of discord and premeditated intentions to 
derail the unionist step. It is not easy for the nation to 
watch this bloody scene that jeopardizes the unity and the hopes 
pinned on it. The Yemeni unity revived the nation's hopes and 
inspired optimism on the part of the Yemeni people. However, 
the bloody incidents now threaten all of this and threaten the 
shared national destiny of the people of Yemen. 
  Sons of Arabism in Yemen: Unity has a permanent rule, 
namely, the need for everybody to rise above their personal 
whims and interests and narrow calculations. Unity cannot be 
achieved and will not last as a factor of strength unless it 
takes inspiration from the spirit of the people and determines 
to contribute to the unity of the nation. Thus, unity cannot 
achieve its objectives unless it daily discovers formulas to 
embody popular will in building a prosperous homeland that 
achieves its national objectives through integration with the 
nation's objectives. 
  The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party has always viewed itself as 
the party of unity and has always worked to develop the idea of 
unity. The party, whose political, organizational, and militant 
course is based on the interest of the nation as a whole, finds 
itself--vis-a-vis what is taking place in Yemen--dutybound to 
caution against the serious peril that endangers the Arab 
destiny. 
  The contemporary pan-Arab and unionist struggle march 
records 
that the Ba'th Party has offered generous sacrifices and martyrs 
for unity and that it gives priority to unity and the unionist 
feeling. From this premise, the Ba'th Party announces to the 
nation and the Yemeni people that it supports unity and that 
unity is the most important and most cherished objective. The 
Arab Socialist Ba'th Party announces its solidarity with the 
struggler Yemeni people for the sake of safeguarding their 
unity, and rejects every reason, act, or justfication that 
encroaches on the entity of unity. 
  The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party appeals to all the national 
forces operating in the Yemeni arena, and the Arab forces 
throughout the Arab homeland, to stand with Yemen's unity and 
with the Yemeni people, and against all foreign attempts to 
interfere in the affairs of Yemeni unity. 
  O Yemenis who are genuinely patriotic and pan-Arab: We 
support you in confronting this danger which threatens the 
Yemeni national destiny. We appeal to you to abide by unity as 
a sacred slogan to confront this tribulation and end the 
sedition and the conspiracy against unity. Let abidance by 
unity now be a yardstick to which all of you will resort to 
judge the behavior of individuals and groups and to judge their 
stands and whether these stands are close or remote from you, 
and from the unionist objectives and aspirations you have for 
your country. Only with a national spirit and pan-Arab 
awareness can the sons of Yemen bury the conspiracy against 
their national unity and tackle the bloody incidents with a 
determination to transform the blood that is being shed into 
lessons for the assimilation of Yemeni unity and a price for 
moving out of these tragic events into a state of affairs that 
will consolidate the pillars of the unionist experiment and that 
will enable it to better express its national and pan-Arab 
essence. That's why we call on all the active and good forces 
and the masses of our Yemeni people who are famous for their 
national and pan-Arab stands to confront all that threatens 
unity. 
  Noble Yemeni people, let all the windows be closed in the 
face of the ill-winds of the conspiracy against Yemen's unity 
and in the face of the foreign forces which tamper with Yemen's 
national fate and the foreign schemes which threaten the future 
of Yemen and the nation. Let the will of the strugglers unite on 
this basis to check this bleeding and to establish a nationalist 
unionist spirit that will protect Yemen and its unity, and that 
will embody the people's determination to enhance the entity of 
unity that was forged by sacrifices, martyrs, and positive 
efforts, and the noble aspirations encompassing national and 
pan-Arab objectives. 
  Greetings to the noble and united Yemeni people. Greetings 
to the martyrs of the Yemeni unity and the Arab nation.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz met with Austrian 
Foreign Minister Alois Mock in Vienna today. They discussed the 
obligations the UN Security Council should fulfill toward Iraq, 
particularly in terms of implementing Paragraph 22 of Resolution 
687 and lifting the unfair embargo since Iraq has implemented 
all pertinent clauses in Resolution 687. 
  They also discussed bilateral ties. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz also met with Hans Blix, 
director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA]. They discussed the IAEA's responsibility to acknowledge 
what Iraq had implemented in the field as stipulated by 
Resolution 687 and the need to fully inform the UN Security 
Council of such as soon as possible, so the Security Council can 
assume its responsibility and immediately start considering the 
implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 as soon as 
possible. 
  The two meetings were attended by Barzan al-Tikriti, Iraq's 
permanent envoy to the UN Headquarters in Geneva; Dr. Rahim al- 
Kital, Iraq's ambassador to Austria; and the deputy director of 
the Iraqi Atomic Energy Organization. Professor Zifferero and a 
number of assistants to the IAEA director attended the meeting 
for the IAEA.

<F P=106> [Report by Kamran Qurrah Daghi: "Russian Official: `We Have </F>
Lost Hope of Lifting Blockade on Iraq Soon'"] 
  [Text] London -- A high-ranking Russian diplomatic source 
has told AL-HAYAH that Moscow has lost hope of lifting the 
blockade on Iraq soon. The source revealed that a scheduled 
visit to Moscow by Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Riyad al-Qaysi 
may not take place, as the Russians have told him they cannot 
receive him before 16 May "because his opposite number, Boris 
Kolokolov, will not be in Moscow." 
  The source said that the Iraqis' "interest in the visit has 
subsided, because they had hoped it would be made before the 
[UN] Security Council discusses continuing the economic 
sanctions against Iraq in the middle of the month." 
  The source pointed out that Moscow has lost hope of the 
Security Council changing its position, and that the council 
will decide to continue the sanctions, "despite the 
Russian-French-Chinese proposals" calling for easing the 
sanctions. 
  As is known, Moscow, Beijing, Paris, and Ankara are exerting 
pressure to lift or ease the blockade imposed on Iraq. But the 
U.S.-British position is unrelenting. 
  The Russian source added that two other factors have made 
Moscow more certain that lifting the blockade on Iraq is not 
easy: First, the U.S. Administration informed a high-level 
Russian official who visited Washington two weeks ago of its 
intention of continuing the sanctions against Baghdad. Second, 
the article written by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher in THE NEW YORK TIMES a week ago, warning of the 
danger of lifting the blockade on Iraq. 
  The sources went on to say that Moscow and Paris are 
studying 
a new draft proposal to be submitted to the Security Council, 
calling for transcending Resolutions 706 and 712 concerning 
selling Iraqi oil under UN supervision. The proposal provides 
for increasing the quantity Baghdad is allowed to sell, namely 
increasing its value from $1.6 billion to $4-5 billion. But the 
problem is that Baghdad is not enthusiastic about the proposal. 
The Russian diplomat said the reason is that 60-70 percent of 
the revenue would not reach Iraq, but would be transferred to 
the Gulf war compensation fund, a part of which would be used to 
finance UN operations.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi: "Iraqi </F>
Cooperation and U.S. Hostility"] 
  [Text] The international community represented by the UN 
Security Council is expected to declare that Iraq has fulfilled 
all its obligations under Resolution 687 and that it is 
essential to implement Clause 22 of the resolution permitting 
Iraq to export its oil, now that Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN 
Special Commission [UNSCOM], has submitted his report in which 
he affirmed Iraq's full cooperation with the commission and 
fulfillment of all of its obligations. However, it seems that 
the United States is waging a fierce campaign through its 
secretary of state, Warren Christopher, to block the 
international community's will and continue the unjust blockade 
against Iraq. 
  The Chinese representative to the Security Council has 
called 
on the Council to recognize the very positive developments 
represented by Iraq's implementation of the resolutions. He 
proposed passing a resolution on a partial lifting of the 
blockade. The Russian representative also spoke about the need 
to give Iraq the chance for further cooperation. For his part, 
the British representative admitted that progress is taking 
place and that the report which Ekeus submitted to the Council 
two days ago was encouraging. 
  According to political observers, China, France, and Russia 
are exerting pressure toward lifting the blockade for 
"humanitarian and commercial" reasons. If we also add the 
British admission that Iraq is cooperating with the Security 
Council, it becomes clear that the United States has been left 
alone and is completely isolated. The international community 
is surrounding it from all sides to make it lift the unfair 
blockade on Iraq. 
  A quick review of what has happened, recalls to memory the 
odious hostility which has characterized U.S. policy. 
Washington has secured resolutions from the Security Council to 
impose a blockade on Iraq and to carry out its criminal military 
aggression. It has done all that in the name of the 
international community and international legitimacy. And now 
that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations under Resolution 687 and 
approved permanent monitoring under Resolution 715 and now that 
Rolf Ekeus has acknowledged Iraq's full cooperation with UNSCOM, 
Washington cannot continue resisting the will of the 
international community, refusing to implement Clause 22 of 
Resolution 687 and calling "for the need to continue the 
blockade against Iraq." This U.S. double standard has been 
exposed. It must be said that the international community 
cannot continue forever following this reckless U.S. policy. 
The international community is inclined toward adopting a 
rational policy that acknowledges the interests of its nations, 
including those of Iraq, and takes into consideration the 
question of international peace and stability. 
  The world understands that Iraq is the difficult figure in 
the region and that it is essential to deal with it with 
rationality, consideration, and good will. Any form of 
aggression or threat of aggression against Iraq will be useless. 
Iraq is strong by its symbol leader Saddam Husayn, its brave 
people, its experience, and great history. 
  In view of all that, it must be said that the United States 
must adopt a different policy toward Iraq, taking into 
consideration the will of the international community and the 
lessons of past experiences. Armies and fleets will not scare 
Iraq, and the blockade will not weaken its will. 
  Warren Christopher will see how the blockade will be 
defeated 
and how the will of good forces -- the will of Iraq and the 
freedom and peace-loving peoples -- will triumph.

<F P=106> ["Sidelines" column by Sabri Hammadi: "More on Christopher's </F>
Article"] 
  [Text] Since the article written by [U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren] Christopher while he was in Saudi Arabia was 
published in the THE NEW YORK TIMES last Friday [29 April] did 
not add anything new to the declared U.S. stand concerning the 
blockade on Iraq, why then was he in such a hurry to write this 
article and to publish it in THE NEW YORK TIMES, of all U.S. 
papers? 
  In our humble estimation, the U.S. secretary of state wrote 
his article, which was full of the usual stupid U.S. fallacies 
and allegations, in order to reassure his allies and "hosts," 
the Saudi rulers, and possibly the Kuwaiti rulers as well, to 
convince them that another article published by THE NEW YORK 
TIMES, following the shooting down of the two U.S. helicopters 
in northern Iraq, which called for a revision of the entire U.S. 
policy toward Iraq, did not express the opinion of any of the 
U.S. decisionmaking institutions but merely the opinion of the 
writer himself. When the secretary of state writes in THE NEW 
YORK TIMES he definitely expresses the official U.S. viewpoint 
and the U.S. position on the blockade. 
  It seems to us that the Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers, who must 
have paid a handsome political and financial reward for the 
Christopher article, were not reassured and did not believe that 
what Christopher alone writes really expresses the U.S.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin: "Who Are Those Who </F>
Neither See Nor Hear?"] 
  [Text] What a wonderful coincidence for us to see them 
issue their leaflets on the day of overwhelming joy and noble 
love! 
  What do the hostile leaflets say? Enemies and other 
disappointed people have begun to use these leaflets after 
failing to achieve their goals through other ways. They wonder 
if we see and hear our people. We saw and heard them, and 
obviously it is they who no longer hear or see as result of 
their failure. 
  The child who called God during celebrations on the leader's 
birthday asked me: Did they not hear me? 
  Did they really not hear her or see her? Did they not hear 
the people declaring their love for and loyalty to the beloved 
leader, as well as their wishes for his health and long life? 
Did they not see the candles of joy flickering in the spring 
breeze in every house, every shop, and every work site? Did 
they not see how the elderly, the men, the women, and the 
children made 28 April a personal festival, in addition to its 
being a collective one? 
  God has blessed this love despite the well-known impact of 
the unjust blockade on the people's lives and mood. 
  There is no doubt that they saw and heard all this but do 
not 
want to admit the reality because it hurts them and destroys 
their interests. 
  They launched a third world war to destroy the vigor of this 
impossible love. 
  By God they could not disturb him. So, how can they harm him 
by issuing leaflets with ridiculous contents written in poor 
style? 
  We cannot blame them, especially since there is nothing left 
to them except nonsense. For our part, we will continue to live 
with this noble love.

<F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "1 May: Moving Away From </F>
Capitalism"] 
  [Text] Some may ask: Have the changes in the world over 
the past five years negatively affected world Labor Day? This 
question has been conspicuous in recent years. A ready-made 
answer is often presented: "The collapse of communism in East 
Europe has brought the era of the laborer to an end." This 
sinister answer links laborers to communism, as if laborers and 
their defense are confined to communism. One of the greatest 
acts of political deception in this century has been America's 
promotion of the lie that socialism has been defeated and that 
the interests of laborers, as defined by socialism, are an 
illusion that will never materialize. They argue that this is 
because a market economy will give the laborers only what they 
deserve. Apart from this, nothing else is "part of the 
jurisdiction" of the economic system. This leads to the 
assumption that the poor segments of society must endure poverty 
because they must accept it as their fate in life. However, the 
chance for the United States to continue this deception was 
short-lived, even shorter than expected by its most sworn 
enemies. This is because the "market economy," which replaced 
communism in East Europe, actually created misery, crime, social 
and moral decadence, and cultural and political degeneration. 
Thus, those who were deceived by slogans of "democracy" and 
"human rights" were soon disillusioned when the human being 
there became the cheapest commodity under the market economy. 
Thus, the overwhelming majority of people in East Europe and 
the Third World discovered that capitalism is the AIDS of the 
age because it spreads poverty, social degradation, and 
injustice. As the true leader of all the social classes and 
segments that have been economically destroyed by the U.S. 
invasion, it was natural for the working class in those 
countries to resume their struggle and to swiftly turn into a 
revolutionary force working for the removal of misery and 
degeneration. The year 1993 truly marked the beginning of world 
struggle against U.S. capitalism's attempts to conquer the world 
and turn the middle class into a poor working class. Such 
attempts have polarized the world into a poor majority and very 
tiny rich minority. Socialism has restored its vitality and 
managed to isolate the capitalist and bourgeois forces. The 
conviction that social justice cannot be achieved under 
capitalism has won more supporters, because the working class in 
eastern Europe and some parts of western and central Europe has 
freed itself of the illusions of capitalism and the market 
economy. Just as late 19th century witnessed the decadence of 
capitalist thought, the late 20th century will witness the 
defeat of capitalism as a way of life. This raises the need for 
a socialism that respects the freedom of human beings, 
recognizes the private sector within a socialist understanding, 
coexists with religion, and entertains strong and clear 
nationalistic traits reflecting the true interests of peoples 
and nations. Such a formula will overcome the weaknesses of 
communism and capitalism at the same time.

  [Text] Health Minister Dr. Umid Midhat Mubarak has blamed 
the persistent sanctions for the progressive deterioration in 
health conditions in Iraq, citing a dearth in medicines and 
medical facilities. 
  The minister was speaking at a news conference in Geneva, 
where he is attending a World Health Organization conference. 
Mubarak said the rising incidence of diseases and deaths among 
children in particular is supported by reports drawn up by 
international organizations. 
  Iraq has satisfied the conditions laid down by UN Security 
Council resolutions, and is now, therefore, eligible for imports 
of food and medicines. Certain quarters, however, are blocking 
these deliveries, said the minister.

  [Text] Geneva, May 8 (INA)--Minister of health has said the 
on-going economic sanctions have caused an alarming rise in 
mortality rate among Iraqi people, and in particular among 
children. 
  In a press conference held here on Friday on the fringe of 
the 47th session of WHO (World Health Organisation), Dr. Umid 
Midhat Mubarak said the sanctions have caused a noticeable 
increase in mortality rate among Iraqis, noting that the rise in 
mortality rate was confirmed and stated in the reports conducted 
by missions of international organisations and agencies which 
visited Iraq. 
  He added that shortages of medicine and medical appliances 
as 
a result of sanctions have further aggravated the suffering of 
sick people and those who suffer from chronic diseases. 
  WHO [as received] went on to say that Iraq has so far 
implemented and met all obligations demanded by UN Security 
Council resolutions, adding that there are certain parties that 
work to prevent the full implementation of UN Security Council 
resolutions. 
  He added that despite the fact that Iraq has met all its 
obligations as stipulated by UN Security Council Resolutions 
715, 768, the UN Security Council has not reciprocated by 
implementing Paragraph 22 of Resolution 768 to lift the 
sanctions and permit Iraq to import food and medicines. 
  Later on Friday, the minister held talks with his Turkish 
counterpart. 
  During the meeting, Dr. Mubarak briefed the Turkish official 
on the tragic health situation in Iraq and the deteriorated 
status of health services caused by the ongoing sanctions. 
  The Turkish minister showed understanding of the tragic 
health condition in Iraq, expressing desire and readiness to 
enhance technical cooperation and boost the exchange of visits 
and expertise. 
  On Tuesday, Dr. Mubarak met with a number of Arab health 
ministers attending the 47th session of WHO currently on in 
Geneva. 
  The minister discussed with Arab officials the negative 
impacts of the economic sanctions on Iraq's health system. 
  Also on Tuesday, Dr. Mubarak met separately with WHO 
President Dr. H. Nakajima, WHO Regional Director for Eastern 
Mediterranean, Dr. Husayn al-Jaza'iri, and health ministers of 
Greek, India, Turkey, China, Pakistan and Indonesia to brief 
them on the deteriorated health status in Iraq. 
  During the talks, the health officials expressed readiness 
to 
probe and define proper mechanism to realize joint cooperation 
towards alleviating the suffering of Iraqi people. 
  In another development, AL-JUMHURIYAH daily on Tuesday 
reported that WHO will supply Iraq with medicines, vaccines and 
medical appliances. 
  Quoted by the daily, Dr. Hashim al-Dabuni, member of the 
National Assembly (the parliament) and Iraq's representative to 
the parliamentarian physicians conference recently concluded in 
Bangkok said that WHO President Dr. H. Nakajima has told him 
that the organisation will work to meet Iraq's need for 
medicine, vaccines and medical appliances and that cost will be 
covered by the Japanese Government. 
  He added that WHO president was able to convince the 
Japanese 
Government that the sanctions have denied Iraq access to its 
assets abroad and that Iraq, due to the sanctions, has no 
financial resources to fund the purchases of medicines and 
medical appliances. 
  Earlier, a report by the Ministry of Health has pointed out 
that fatalities among Iraqi people over the past month of 
February have risen sharply the ongoing economic sanctions 
imposed on the country. 
  As usual children are hit hardest by the sanctions, the 
reported noted, saying that the achievements of the last decade 
in terms of improved health services such as reaching the 80 per 
cent target the universal child immunization programmme and 
halving infant mortality rates have been badly affected. 
  The report indicating that some 6,901 Iraqi people have died 
over the said period because of the continuation of the economic 
embargo that deprived the Iraqi people of food and medicine. 
  According to the report, some 5,446 children under the age 
of 
five perished because of diarrhea, malnutrition and pneumonia.

  The head of the al-Mustaqbal Party delegation praised 
President Saddam Husayn's courageous leadership and the bravery 
of the Iraqis who have confronted a military aggression and 
challenged economic aggression represented by the embargo 
clamped on Iraq through the reconstruction campaign. He 
stressed that the aggression against Iraq is an aggression 
against the Arab nation, especially since Iraq has become the 
revolutionary Arab base whose struggle for the sake of Arab 
causes is based on firm and principled stands.

  [Text] The forces of Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani 
continued to exchange fire yesterday in Chamchamal, Singaw, 
Khurmal, Tawilah, and Banjwin. Elements from the so-called 
Islamic Movement supported the Mas'ud Barzani elements to 
control the offices of the Jalal Talabani clique. In response, 
the Talabani clique attacked a number of men of religion in the 
region, killing five of them. 
  In Irbil Governorate, clashes flared up on the outskirts of 
Salah al-Din summer resort, where Mas'ud Barzani's headquarters 
are located. Other clashes took place in Kuysanjaq and the 
(Katlajan) complex. 
  Elements from the Mas'ud Barzani group opened fire with 
machine guns and rocket launchers on Jalal Talabani's house in 
Shaqlawah. 
  Reports from Irbil say that a state of fear and panic is 
prevailing among the leaders of the saboteurs. They fear that 
the situation in Irbil might explode because the situation there 
is difficult to control due to the existence of most of the 
forces and offices of Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabi there. 
Thousands of the residents of districts and cities there fled 
their homes to the mountains and valleys in fear for their 
lives. Elements from the cliques of saboteurs are taking 
advantage of the situation there to loot homes and shops.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Iraqi Kurdish Sources Confirm </F>
Capture of Revolutionary Guard Members"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- Iraqi Kurdish sources have stated that 
Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces attacked three towns inside 
Iraqi Kurdistan over the past few days, which also witnessed 
clashes between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] led by 
Jalal Talabani and the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] led by 
Mas'ud Barzani. 
  PUK officials contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday said 
that joint forces of the Revolutionary Guard and the Islamic 
Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan [IMIK] (a fundamentalist movement 
suspected of receiving aid from Iran) last Tuesday attacked the 
towns of Halabjah and Khurmal near the Iraqi-Iranian border and 
tried to control them "but PUK forces confronted and killed, 
wounded, and captured some members of these forces," according 
to the sources, which added that the day before yesterday the 
village of Biyarah [as transliterated] near Halabjah was the 
target of "another attack by the forces of the Revolutionary 
Guard and the IMIK" and that the attack was repulsed by PUK 
forces. The sources added that the attacking forces "suffered 
150 dead, some of whom carried Revolutionary Guard 
identification cards," and the the prisoners taken by PUK forces 
included "three Iranian Revolutionary Guard members." They 
further said that the PUK forces also seized arms and equipment 
from the attackers. 
  Fierce battles had taken place in December last year between 
the PUK and the IMIK, as a result of which the latter lost its 
influence in the areas close to the Iranian borders. 
  Meanwhile, sources in the parties of Barzani and Talabani 
have confirmed that calm continued for the second day yesterday 
in the Iraqi Kurdish areas where armed clashes occurred last 
week between fighters of the two parties, but independent 
sources say that the situation is still tense in some areas. 
Joint committees from both parties are visiting these areas and 
trying to normalize the situation there. 
  It should be noted that the Central Committee of the Iraqi 
Communist Party had sent a message to Barzani, Talabani, and the 
political bureaus of their two parties urging "an end to the 
fighting and a restoration of the situation which existed before 
2 May." In a bulletin, a copy of which was received by AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT, it said that the Central Committee held an emergency 
meeting last Saturday during which it discussed the recent 
clashes and issued a statement urging that "the blood of the 
Kurdish people be spared" and that "the region of Kurdistan 
should not fall into the trap which Saddam Husayn's clique is 
trying hard to push it into." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Marivan, Kurdistan Prov., May 11, IRNA -- In the 
attack of the forces of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan of Iraq 
[PUK] affiliated to Jalal Talabani against the positions of the

of the attackers were either killed or injured, according to a 
member of the Central Council of the Islamic Movement Party.

Islamic 
Movement of Iraq have prepared themselves for confronting a wide 
attack from the Patriotic Union in Galuyeh, which could occur at

  The region of Galuyeh was under the heavy fire of the PUK 
since Tuesday morning.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic </F>
Union of Kurdistan, by Gabriel Bertinetto; place and date not 
given: "If Saddam Falls, I Will Give Up the Kurdish Dream"] 
  [Text] "Uniting all the Kurds under a single state by 
overcoming the current artificial borders remains the common 
dream of our people. But politics is not made of dreams. We 
are therefore aiming at a federal and democratic state inside 
the current Iraqi borders, as long as the country is freed from 
Saddam's dictatorship." This is how Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan leader Jalal Talabani, who was received yesterday by 
President Scalfaro and trade union and political leaders 
(including [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary Occhetto), 
summarizes up the objective of his party, the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan, in this interview. 
  [Bertinetto] Mr. Talabani, the news that comes from Iraqi 
Kurdistan is not very positive. In addition to the continuing 
economic crisis, there are reports of divergencies and even of 
some armed clashes between your people and supporters of 
Barzani. What is happening? 
  [Talabani] In effect there are difficulties. Despite the 
considerable progress made in relaunching agriculture, 
industrial activity is stagnant, also because of the three-sided 
embargo of which we are the victims: the internal embargo 
imposed upon us by Baghdad, that of the neighboring countries, 
and the international embargo decreed upon by the United Nations 
against Iraq (which, though directed at Saddam, also involves 
Kurdistan). The same holds true for the production of 
electricity and for infrastructure work in general, which are at 
a very low level. Among our major problems is the forced exile 
of 300,000 Kurdish people who the Iraqi authorities are 
preventing from returning. As for the incidents between our 
forces and those of our allies, these are restricted to certain 
areas and have been caused by the mistakes made by the local 
leaders of the Democratic Party, as Barzani himself admitted. 
The situation is now getting back to normal. 
  [Bertinetto] What do the two parties agree and disagree on? 
  [Talabani] There is accord on participating in an alliance 
whose objectives are the democratization of society, defense 
from outside aggression, and the consolidation of a regional 
self-government. There is disagreement on the types of reforms 
to be implemented. In general, one can say that a national 
democratic trend and a social democratic trend are face-to-face. 
  [Bertinetto] How do you judge the support given by the 
United 
Nations to Iraqi Kurdistan? 
  [Talabani] I would say that not enough is being done. A lot 
of money has in fact been spent, but a lot has also been wasted 
in the bureaucratic management of aid. We would prefer to see a 
decision on the use of funds made in coordination with our local 
government. If this does not happen, I do not think that it is a 
matter of our not being trusted, since all the foreign visitors 
recognize the fact that we have made great steps ahead. 
Especially if you consider that we started from practically 
nothing after the devastation caused by the Iraqi military, 
which also left us with 22 million mines spread throughout our 
territory, many of which are Italian made. 
  [Bertinetto] Kurdistan is currently much more than an 
autonomous region but much less than an independent state. What 
would you like to become in the future? 
  [Talabani] It depends. If the dictatorship were to fall, we 
would be in favor of a democratic and federal state that would 
comprise the Kurds and Iraqis. If tyranny remains, the Kurds 
will have to seek other paths. 
  [Bertinetto] Do you think that Saddam is still strong? 
  [Talabani] Things are worsening in Iraq. Discontent is 
increasing among the people and even in the Army. However, you 
must not overlook the groups in the Armed Forces and the police 
that consistently pledge absolute loyalty to Saddam. 
  [Bertinetto] Let us assume that the dictatorship is 
overthrown. Would the creation of a federal state mean 
abandoning the historical project of uniting all the Kurds in a 
single state between the existing borders of Iraq, Iran, and 
Turkey? 
  [Talabani] It is a known fact that Kurdistan was 
artificially 
divided after the World War I. We Kurds are the victims of a 
conspiracy against us. However, we must be realistic. At 
present it is impossible to modify the borders between all the 
countries in the area. The unity of all the Kurds does remain 
the final objective, because a divided nation cannot give up its 
dream to be united. It remains inside us, but it is a dream, 
and a responsible political leadership cannot act on the basis 
of dreams. 
  [Bertinetto] Last year you tried to mediate between the 
Turkish Goverment and the PKK [Workers' Party of Kurdistan] 
rebels. A truce was reached, but then, unfortunately, fighting 
started again, and it was even bloodier than before. Why? 
  [Talabani] One of the reasons was the death of President 
Turgut Ozal. He was one of the Turkish authorities most willing 
to negotiate. One also can say the the atmosphere was still not 
ready for a political solution. 
  [Bertinetto] The Turkish Kurds, the PKK, and affiliated 
groups complain that Europe is not showing any interest in their 
cause, and in this way they justify the often clamorous, and 
sometimes violent, protest demonstrations they incite in the 
cities of countries where there are massive numbers of Kurdish 
emigrants, primarily Germany. What do you think? 
  [Talabani] I do not think that Europe has shown little 
interest in the Kurdish issue. The European Council and the 
European Parliament voted on resolutions that call for human 
rights to be respected, Germany has stopped the supply of 
weapons to Ankara, and the Bundestag has asked for a political 
solution to the conflict. Perhaps all of this is not enough, 
perhaps certain Kurdish groups expect more, but this cannot 
justify the violation of laws in countries in which they are 
guests, because in this way they would lose support and sympathy.

  [Text] Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan [PUK], has addressed an appeal to the 
peshmerga forces in Kurdistan and the Kurdish masses. He 
stressed the need for unity and solidarity among the Kurdish 
people in general and between the PUK and the Kurdish Democratic 
Party in particular. 
  Talabani said that making the democratic experience in 
Kurdistan a success and the survival and promotion of the 
government of Kurdistan is contingent upon the unity of the 
people's ranks. He emphasized that all resources must be 
devoted to protecting liberated Kurdistan and liberating the 
country from the dictatorship and establishing a federal 
democratic Iraq. He called on the struggling Kurdish parties to 
enhance their struggle and efforts to entrench peace and 
fraternity in dear Kurdistan.

  [Excerpt] London, AL-HAYAH -- Kurdish leaders Jalal 
Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani have stressed to AL-HAYAH their 
eagerness to implement the agreements between their parties, the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, 
especially an agreement they signed with the Unified Iraqi 
National Congress on Sunday night/Monday morning. It stipulates 
the speeding up of normalization in the areas that witnessed 
clashes between fighters from the two parties in north Iraq. 
The agreement also stipulates that the normalization process 
should be completed in three days. 
  Barzani stressed the need to protect "our people's 
democratic 
experiment and unity and the Iraqi national opposition movement 
and its future." Talabani, who will head for Kurdistan 
accompanied by a number of the "National Congress," called for 
"maximum efforts to restore stability and security to our 
homeland." 
  A high-ranking official in the Congress has said that 
"matters are normal and the agreement is complied with fully." 
He pointed out that units belonging to the Congress are 
deployed on the contact lines and at main facilities and 
security barriers in the area. Kurdish administration sources 
have stressed that calm has been restored in the area and that 
the administration has managed to contain all the violations 
that had taken place over the past two days. 
  In the same context the Iraqi opposition official criticized 
"Iranian exaggerations" about the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan. 
And officials from the two main Kurdish parties, in statements 
to AL-HAYAH, accused Tehran of seeking to "foment sedition." 
They denied a report attributed by AFP to the official Iranian 
News Agency, namely that a "senior official" from the Kurdistan 
Democratic Party said that 2,800 people have been killed in the 
fighting in north Iraq. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 9 May (INA)--The pro-government Kurdistan 
Democratic Party has stressed that the Iraqi Kurds will not 
abandon their loyalty to the leadership of President Saddam 
Husayn regardless of all forms of imperialist, Zionist, and 
reactionary plotting. 
  In a statement issued today in light of the bloody clashes 
currently taking place in the Autonomous Region in northern Iraq 
between the subversive, agent, and treasonous cliques, the party 
said that the new crimes which are being perpetrated by these 
cliques clearly reconfirm an established fact; namely, that the 
Iraqi Kurds will not enjoy peace, security, and true prosperity 
until the return of legitimacy and the central authority to the 
all Iraqi Kurdistan. 
  The statement noted that the humiliated enemies, 
conspirators, and traitors, who have imposed themselves as 
trustees on the Iraqi Kurds by force, coercion, compulsion, and 
terrorism, have spread destruction, sabotage, killing, and 
terrorism all over Kurdistan, and perpetrated all forms of 
crimes, including the plundering of the Kurdish people's food. 
They have also spread chaos to the point where the citizens 
have begun to feel insecure. 
  In its statement, the Kurdistan Democratic Party said that 
the bloody confrontations taking place between the agent and 
reactionary symbols and elements were the result of a conflict 
between their selfish, parochial personal interests, which are 
linked to the colonialist interests, without taking the Kurdish 
people's aspirations and hopes into consideration. 
  The party called for solidarity between the Iraqi Kurds and 
all the honest people in the world to expose these cliques and 
their relations with the foreigners, to reject all their 
actions, and to call for the return of legitimacy and the 
constitutional authority to all Iraqi Kurdistan.

the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, the Executive Council of the 
Kurdistan Autonomous region, and the representatives of the 
Kurdistan Autonomous Region at the National Assembly; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
God sets forth a parable: A city enjoying security and quiet, 
abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place. Yet was 
it ungrateful for the favors of God. So God made it taste of 
hunger and terror in extremes closing in on it like a garment 
from every side, because of the evil which its people wrought. 
[koranic verses] 
  An appeal to our Kurdish people in the Kurdistan Autonomous 
Region following the large-scale armed clashes between the 
Barzani and Talabani groups: 
  O our people who are shackled by the chains of the infidel 
coalition and the hegemony of the traitors and lackeys; O our 
good Kurdish people in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region: We have 
drawn your attention in the past to the fact that those who are 
tampering with Kurdistan [words indistinct] and its 
developmental structure which was built by the glorious 17-30 
Revolution in recognition of our Kurdish people's national and 
cultural rights are merely pawns in the hands of international 
tyranny, which it moves as it pleases to achieve its goals and 
objectives in the easiest way and with the least sacrifices. 
  Those who chose to follow the infidel foreigner and joined 
his aggressive plans, with all this submission and humiliation, 
have severed all links with you about which they used to brag. 
They have deceived some people and were about to sever all 
links to land and history. God, however, has turned their evil 
against them. They are now being exposed before the entire 
people. Thanks to God's will, one is falling by the fire of the 
other in an action financed by the evil coalition. They want to 
set Kurdistan ablaze because they do not want it to return to 
the motherland, which gave it security, prosperity, and rights. 
They are setting it ablaze so that no one will pay attention to 
his rights, development, and progress, and so that the sedition 
will continue as it continues in Lebanon and Afghanistan. 
  Our honorable brothers in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, 
disarm the combating warriors of their weapons and then turn the 
weapons against their leaders because they, by God, are 
implementing the schemes of imperialism, Zionist, and 
reactionism and are igniting a fire that will consume everything 
in Kurdistan. Turn the fire of God against the traitors of the 
homeland and the people. Chase the enemies of God in Kurdistan 
and reject their ugly presence because we, by God, are a people 
who only accept friends from within themselves. In the name of 
God, the merciful, the compassionate: O ye who believe take not 
for your friends unbelievers rather than believers; do ye wish 
to offer God an open proof against yourselves? 
  [Signed] The Legislative Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous 
Region, the Executive Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous 
region, and the representatives of the Kurdistan Autonomous 
Region at the National Assembly

  [Text] Baghdad, 6 May (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has 
said the coalition forces' silence on the massacres of Iraq's 
Kurds, represented by the conflict between the Talabani and 
Barzani groups, exposes the false humanitarian slogans 
Washington and its allies used as a cover to enter into 
Kurdistan. 
  In its editorial today, the paper emphasizes that the 
continued annihilation of Kurds in the fierce and ongoing 
confrontations between the Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani 
groups sheds light on the serious conspiracy concocted by the 
colonialist and Zionist circles against Iraq and its people. 
  AL-'IRAQ adds that the comprehensive and large-scale 
fighting 
between the Talabani and Barzani gangs reflects the miserable 
situation created by the erroneous circumstances in the absence 
of order and law in the area. 
  The paper wonders about foreign forces' role in confronting 
the scandals and terrible crimes to which the sons of Kurdistan 
are being subjected. These forces came on the pretext of 
immediately intervening and protecting the Kurds, if they are 
subjected to any military operation. 
  Suffice it to say that turning a blind eye to the ongoing 
massacres of Iraq's Kurds is a flagrant war against the Kurds 
targeting their lives, existence, fate, and their future, the 
paper notes. 
  AL-'IRAQ describes the position of the foreign forces, which 
are idly watching the slaughtering of Iraq's Kurds at the hands 
of the Talabani and Barzani gangs, as a new formula of 
imperialist-Zionist hypocrisy and a form of intrigue, lies, 
distortion, falsification, reversal of realities, and 
concealment of facts away from the world public opinion.

90 percent of the marshlands in the south have been dried up and 
that these areas have no water in them except for some parts of 
the marshlands of al-Basrah and al-'Amarah. In an attempt to 
describe the bad conditions the marshland dwellers are living 
in, the sources said that drying up the marshlands has pushed 
most of the people there to migrate to other areas. The 
terrorist regime in Baghdad has also transferred some of the 
marshland dwellers to unknown districts. 
  In another report, an Iraqi mujahid said that the surprise 
attack the mujahidin forces carried out recently on the 
headquarters of the 10th Battalion in the north al-Qurnah led to 
the elimination of two platoons and the killing of the commander 
of the battalion. In these operations, the mujahidin seized a 
number of mortars, some communications equipment, and some 
military documents.

  [Text] Babil -- The largest wheat and barley harvest 
campaign to be witnessed by Babil Governorate this year has 
begun with the participation of thousands of peasants and 
farmers. 
  Sa'id Salman al-Fadili, director of Babil Agriculture 
Department, said some 14 committee have been formed to supervise 
harvest operations and to provide the necessary means of 
transport to ensure the success of the campaign, which covers 
293,000 donums and in which 105 harvesters will be used. Fuel 
and spare parts have also been ensured for the harvesters. He 
added that trucks have been provided to transport grains 
directly to silos and government receiving centers, and the 
Agriculture Department's teams have been instructed to join the 
campaign to follow its progress. 
  Al-Fadili said a mobile repair workshop with mechanics will 
accompany the harvesters, which can be transferred from one 
administrative unit to another if necessary to achieve a balance 
and to complete the harvest in all areas at once.

  [Excerpts] Ninawa -- Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih 
and Agriculture Minister Bashir 'Alwan Hammadi have discussed 
with Ninawa Governor Staff Lt Gen 'Abd-al-Wahid Shannan Al Ribat 
the final preparations that have been made to begin the campaign 
for harvesting and marketing wheat and barley crops in the 
governorate. 
  This was during an expanded meeting of the governorate's 
Central Harvest and Marketing Committee which was attended by 
comrade Najm 'Abdallah al-'Iraqi, secretary of the Ba'th Party 
Ninawa Branch; 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Sayigh, secretary of the Mosul 
branch; several directors from the two ministries, heads of the 
departments concerned with the campaign; and representatives of 
the Federation of Peasant Cooperative Societies in the 
governorate. 
  The ministers praised the efforts and preparations that have 
been made by the Central Committee and the subcommittees in the 
Ninawa and Mosul party branches and other participant sides for 
the success of the harvest and marketing campaign in fulfillment 
of leader President Saddam Husayn's desire to ensure the 
campaign's requirements throughout our country, especially in 
Ninawa Governorate, in order to guarantee food for the people 
and to defeat the unfair blockade on our country. [passage 
omitted] 
  It was decided during the meeting to increase the present 
storage capacity so as to absorb the entire quantity of grain to 
be bought. Some 300 trucks have been ensured for transporting 
grain. This is in addition to transport by rail. 
  The agriculture minister affirmed that Ninawa will be the 
nail in the coffin of the food embargo imposed on our people. 
He said: This governorate, which leader President Saddam Husayn 
called "the bread basket of great Iraq," will play a major role 
in guaranteeing people's food. 
  The ministers of trade and agriculture, accompanied by the 
governor, then made a tour of several harvest and marketing 
areas to inspect the preparations which have been made. The 
areas included: al-Hadr, al-Qayyarah, Shawrah, Mahallabiyah, 
Tall 'Afar, Sinjar, al-Bi'aj, Tall Kayf, and Ba'shiqah.

  [Text] Kathmandu, May 7 (AFP) -- Prime Minister Girija 
Prasad Koirala of Nepal returned home in high spirits from the 
United States Saturday after a medical checkup there which gave 
him the all clear. 
  Talking to newsmen at the airport soon after his arrival 
Koirala said "I am not suffering from any diseases and my health 
condition is now normal. I will be joining official duties from 
Sunday."

to rest, a member of his family said.

<F P=106> [Message to the Bosnian people by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i; </F>
place and date not given--read by announcer] 
  [Text] World leaders are sitting and waiting for the 
victims to take their last breath. These victims are the 
Muslims of former Yugoslavia, and their only sin is that they 
are Muslims. We do not just claim this; there is clear evidence 
to prove it. The reason the world powers are against the 
Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina is that it exists as a sovereign 
and independent state with the ethnic Muslim population in the 
majority, and the world powers cannot cope with that fact. This 
is a problem facing Muslims throughout the world because the 
United Nations and all other world organizations have chosen to 
behave in the worst possible way in this situation. I declare 
here that when it comes to the Muslim people, the UN secretary 
general has tarnished his reputation and will not be able to 
restore it, no matter what price he is prepared to pay. 
  Muslims throughout the world saw what was happening in 
Bosnia, and they said: Sir, because the other side is being 
helped, allow us to go to Bosnia to help the Muslims. But the 
answer was: No. The Muslims then said: Allow us to send 
weapons. The answer was again No, as part of a blatant attempt 
to deceive the world into believing that no side is being 
helped. One side has arms, the other is fighting the war 
without them: one side against the other while the world 
community, instead of either taking the arms from one side or 
giving arms to the other, has remained on the sidelines cruelly 
watching how the wretched ones fall. 
  They [not further identified] said they would send the blue 
helmets. The Muslim countries immediately asked that their 
troops be allowed to take part in the action. But the answer 
was again: No. It is not just the Islamic Republic of Iran that 
is not allowed to send troops; not a single Islamic country has 
been allowed to set off in the direction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
What does this mean? The soldiers sent there have been given 
orders to help the Serb aggression, but the public is unaware of 
this. This fact is being concealed from the Muslims. What we 
are witnessing brings great shame to the Western culture and the 
civlization that they constantly invoke. 
  America's behavior and false promises about 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have yielded no results. All other 
international organizations and some European 
countries--England, in particular--have not produced any results 
either. 
  A handful of Muslims has been left helpless, waiting for the 
day they will be butchered. What should the Muslims do? What 
other path is there, except the hajj? Only people's awareness 
can destroy the West's insolence. It is not enough for some 
people or ulemas from several countries to attend conferences 
all over the world and issue declarations. Hundreds of such 
declarations have been issued so far. Among them is the one 
against the Israeli aggressor, but it has not produced any 
results or helped anyone. 
  In conclusion, Ayatollah [word indistinct] Khamene'i said 
that in Mecca during this year's hajj 15 May 1994 was declared 
[as received] the Day of Bosnia-Herzegovina to protest the 
suffering of the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Message from Ayatollah Jannati to the Bosnian people; place </F>
and date not given--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Thanks to Almighty God, the master of [word 
indistinct] worlds. Thanks to God, who is allowing and enabling 
the voice and vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as the 
loudest voice of protest against the terror against the Bosnian 
people, against the ruthlessness and aggressive propaganda from 
the West, to express our compassion for your terrible and 
enormous suffering. 
  Our message to you from here is that, God willing, we will 
use all of our strength to support you. The great leader of the 
Islamic revolution has left as his legacy to us the right and 
obligation as a nation to help all of our neighboring brothers. 
  The people are ready to offer all possible help, even above 
their means, not only in the form of propaganda, political, or 
financial help, but in every way. We hope that other Muslims 
will also feel the same obligation and that they will remember 
the suffering your state is experiencing--a state of Muslims, 
and not a state with just one Muslim community. 
  Hatred of you is the reason for the Bosnian tragedy that we 
are watching. This is not a feeling proscribed by Islam or by 
your faith. This is an aggression against the purity and 
holiness of Islam and Muslims. This is why all Muslims are firm 
in their decision to stand by you bravely and resolutely. I am 
sure that the emissary of Islam, our dear God, shares your pain 
and suffering, the religious rights and [words indstinct], for 
you have been the victims of aggression and terror, and because 
they want to destroy you simply because you are Muslims. 
  God willing, Muslims will see the light. Muslims are ready 
to stand before their enemies and oppose them. They must stand 
up and resist the Serb criminals. They must fight against all 
forces that remain silent in the face of crime, against the 
advocates of war who instigate new attacks and aggression. I 
hope, God willing, that these dark nights will end as soon as 
possible. The dawn of your victory is coming. We will witness 
the day when Islam rises and become a mainstay in the area. You 
will be strong, [word indistinct] with us and other Muslims in 
the world. God willing, the flag of Islam will be erected there 
so that the light of Islam can shine in the area. 
  I humbly pray to Almighty God to give us as soon as possible 
the gift of living in happiness, beside one another, in 
prosperity, celebrating our joint success. God willing.

  [Text] The Voice of Bosnia started transmission via the 
Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran during the 
final minutes of 9 May. 
  In an interview with our correspondent Pirhade'i about the 
reasons for starting the radio program and its effects on the 
course of events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mr. Larijani, the head 
of the Voice and Vision Organization of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, said: 
  [Begin Larijani recording] In the name of God, the 
compassionate, the merciful. We are very glad that thanks to 
the efforts of the overseas department of the Voice and Vision 
and those involved in the project, the Bosnian program started, 
thank God. 
  Naturally, in the present world conditions, where in the 
heart of Europe there is an innocent nation whose situation is 
not understood by any of the superpowers -- you have seen in the 
news these days what they have done to the people of Gorazde. 
Transmitting the innocent call of those self-sacrificing and 
hardworking people was our religious duty. Because of the goal 
of the Islamic revolution in broadcasting the message of 
Muslims, it was a necessary task. We were able to make 
preparations quickly to start the program. 
  The program is transmitted at 2300 hours Tehran time [1930 
GMT] every night, on 9745 kHz, 31 m wave band, which is about 
2030 hours their time. We are trying to expand the program. We 
hope that we will quickly be able to make preparations to expand 
the program. 
  Of course, a great deal of effort went into the task, 
because 
they could not speak Persian well and had not received the 
necessary training. There were, naturally, problems for us in 
terms of translation. However, certain measures have been taken 
and I hope that the program will be expanded soon. 
  Undoubtedly such programs could have very favorable results 
in sending useful information to the people of Bosnia, 
considering the fact that they are under propaganda pressure, 
too. It is a small deed. By expanding the program, we are 
trying to transmit the information on time and at an appropriate 
volume to them. [end recording] 
  At the radio's inaugural ceremony, in addition to Voice and 
Vision officials, there were a number of officials of the 
Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Culture, and Islamic Guidance and 
a number of the radio's staff. 
  The programs of the radio, which will cover the Balkans, 
will 
include news on Bosnia-Herzegovina, commentary, report, 
developments in the world of Islam, and the culture and 
literature of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Statement by Bosnian Ambassador Omar Bahman on 10 May--read </F>
by announcer] 
  [Text] The dramatic war scenes that we have witnessed over 
the last two years have left the world traditionally unreceptive 
to our arguments. The new dynamism in the rhythm of the media 
activities by Islamic countries has provided an opportunity to 
reaffirm Islamic identity in all spheres of life and work. 
Starting today, all Muslims who speak and understand the 
Bosnian language will be able to listen to the voice of truth, 
the voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Bosnian 
language. I hope that, God willing, this radio will prevent the 
world community from washing the blood and tears of its victims 
from its hands without any responsibility and will help to 
expose the background of the shameful intentions of timid, 
insensitive, and talentless politicians. 
  I have the honor to thank our Iranian brothers for their 
exceptional efforts in launching this program. At the same 
time, I hope that the day of our final victory and of justice 
and truth for which the Bosnian people have been fighting is 
very near and that, God willing, on that day we shall be able to 
share our happiness with them.

  [Excerpt] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani today received 
members of a Kuwaiti scientific delegation, comprising 
chancellors and lecturers of faculties of law and science of 
some universities and a number of writers and journalists from 
that country. 
  At the meeting the president welcomed the idea of exchange 
of 
views between Iranian and Kuwaiti scientific delegations as a 
valuable and beneficial move. Stressing that it should 
continue, he said it helps to strengthen science and culture 
ties between the two countries. 
  Referring to the problems facing the region, particularly 
since the Persian Gulf war, the president cited the following as 
the negative effects of the war: The way that America and some 
western countries have taken advantage of the situation to 
justify their illegal presence in the region; the difficult 
living conditions of the people of Iraq; and moves of the West 
in instilling fear through adverse propaganda representing Iran 
as an enemy of the countries in the region, creating an 
atmosphere of mistrust in order to sell western arms and 
military hardware, and raising a hue and cry by exaggerating 
peripheral and divisive issues in the region. 
  The president added: If the interests of the regional 
nations, and not the world powers, are considered in cooperation 
between Persian Gulf littoral states, and issues are reviewed in 
a sincere atmosphere and with cooperation, the unfavorable 
conditions in the region would be solved by the countries in the 
region. 
  In reply to a question by a Kuwaiti writer about the present 
situation in Iran, the president said: Iran's future is very 
clear to us. Thanks to the patience and hard work of our good 
people and the efforts of our sympathetic officials, we have 
carried out important fundamental and infrastructural work since 
the war imposed by Iraq, which is unprecedented in all eras of 
Iran's history. 
  He added: Currently many of the raw materials for industry, 
including metals and petrochemicals, are produced domestically. 
Large-scale industrial projects -- from the research to the 
operational stages -- are being implemented with domestic 
materials and experts. You witnessed at close hand the knowhow 
and expertise of Iran's specialists in the field in the course 
of extinguishing the oil well fires in Kuwait. 
  The president declared Iran's preparedness to help 
neighboring countries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani today separately 
received the French and Indonesian ambassadors at the end of 
their missions in Tehran. 
  According to a Central News Unit report, at his meeting with 
the president, French Ambassador Mr. De Verdiere said: France is 
fully aware of Iran's important role in the region and the 
world. It attaches a great deal of importance to the expansion 
of its diplomatic, economic, and cultural cooperation with this 
country, especially in the construction period. 
  Thanking the French ambassador for his good work toward the 
expansion of cooperation between the two countries Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed the hope that, with more 
consultation between the two countries' authorities, the way to 
the expansion of ties will be smoothed in the future. 
  Also at a meeting with Mr. Sudarsono, the Indonesian 
ambassador, the president described the recent visit by that 
country's president to Iran as very effective in deepening 
mutual ties. Referring to Indonesia's important role in the 
Nonaligned Movement and the religious and cultural common 
denominators of the peoples of the two countries the president 
welcomed future expansion of cooperation. 
  The Indonesian ambassador said Iran was important owing to 
her possession of rich natural and human resources. He said: I 
have gained the best experience of my life witnessing Iran's 
great progress. I hope that experience will be effective in 
further deepening the cooperation between Iran and Indonesia.

  [Text] Tehran, May 11, IRNA -- A morning English daily here 
Wednesday [11 May] said that Washington's charges against Iran 
and six other countries on supporting terrorist groups was only 
meant to divert world public opinion from its own activities. 
  Commenting on the publication of a report by the U.S. in 
which seven third world countries have been introduced as main 
supporters of terrorism, the `TEHRAN TIMES' wrote in its 
editorial that a brief look would reveal that all the seven 
countries were those that were not prepared to give in to the 
American global superpower role, and opposed Washington's 
expansionist policies. 
  The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was the greatest 
center 
for training terrorists, and coup d'etats and assassinations 
have been among the basic components of American foreign policy 
in the decades after World War II, argued the paper. 
  It concluded by saying that the relations between the 
American government and the terrorist groups was an "undeniable" 
fact.

<F P=106> [Article by K. Subrahmanyam: "A Time To Be Firm Yet </F>
Flexible"] 
  [Text] A sense of unease is shared by a large number of 
observers about the forthcoming visit by the prime minister to 
the US. This arises out of the asymmetric situation in which it 
is well known what the US demands are. But it is not clear to 
the Indian Parliament and the people what the Indian prime 
minister will demand from the US President or what his replies 
will be in respect of likely US demands. Indian leadership has 
a tradition of being defensive and adhocist. Consequently 
Parliament and the public are rarely taken into confidence what 
our bottom lines are on various issues. Parliament is usually 
reassured that the government will stand firm and will not yield 
to any pressure or even soothed that there are no pressures at 
all, only suggestions, preferred desires of other nations. 
  From the US side there are three demands. Firstly, on 
Kashmir they would like India to discuss the problem with 
Pakistanis and Kashmiris (without being precise about whom they 
are referring to) and bring to an end the violence in the 
valley. Secondly, to ask India to enter into some regime of 
nuclear restraint and not to deploy missiles. Thirdly, on the 
commercial side they would press India to shorten the transition 
periods in respect of various TRIPS [trade-related intellectual 
property rights] related items even as they try not to shorten 
the transition periods in respect of textile quotas. It is 
likely the US will take the offensive on these three issues. 
The Indian response could be just defensive: to indulge in 
stonewalling and then claim that the government of India had 
stood firm. An alternative could be to be evasive, vague in our 
responses and then drag on the issues over a period of time. 
This runs the risk of US side resorting to "Salami-slicing" 
tactics and try to extract small but meaningful concessions at a 
time from India. This is what the parliamentarians and media 
observers are worried about. 
  It will be generally uncharacteristic of our way of 
functioning if the prime minister is to take the initiative in 
respect of the three issues mentioned or even launch counter 
offensives in these areas. Though this is considered unlikely 
it is worthwhile examining. Let us take the Kashmir issue. 
Today Kashmir has to be viewed as part of a larger worldwide 
phenomenon of assertion of extremist ethno-nationalism by a 
section of the people in Kashmir valley, supported by Pakistan 
with men, money and materials. Kashmir in this respect is not an 
isolated issue. There are similar problems in Bosnia, Kosovo, 
Transylvania, Ukraine, Abkhazia, Nagorno Karabakh, Kurdistan, 
Baluchistan, Iranian Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Sindh and various 
Central Asian Republics. Does US have a policy in respect of 
such ethno-nationalist demands? Have the US government thought 
through the issue of ethno-nationalist forces being unleashed in 
various parts of the world? In the light of some of the 
pronouncements of US officials on Kashmir, will Russia be 
justified in drawing the inference the Russian minorities in all 
former Soviet republics have the right of self-determination? 
  Secondly there was a recent article of the national security 
adviser to the US President Mr Anthony Lake, in the Foreign 
Affairs quarterly which advocated a policy of dual containment 
of Iran and Iraq. The article was conspicuous by the absence of 
any mention of Pakistan and it is obvious there can be no 
containment of Iran without Pakistan playing a role in it. Mr 
Lake has to be taken seriously because of his official position. 
Is the US policy towards Pakistan, including the efforts to 
give one time waiver from Pressler amendment related to its 
containment policy vis-a-vis Iran? India has considerable 
mutuality of interests with the United States in regard to the 
free flow of oil from the Gulf, the stability of the Gulf 
states, containment of Islamic fundamentalism, the drugs flow 
though the gulf countries and associated terrorism and 
narco-terrorism. If the US is developing a policy in this area 
which is linked up with Pakistan's role and consequently its 
interest in militarily strengthening Pakistan, India will be 
interested in knowing more about it. 
  What are the parameters of US policies in regard to drugs, 
international terrorism and nuclear proliferation in the region 
given the US interest in the containment of Iran? In the 
eighties the US according a higher priority to enabling the 
Afghan mujahideen fight the Soviets in Afghanistan gave a lower 
priority to these three factors in respect of Pakistan. For 
India it is highly relevant to know whether that could be 
repeated. It will be necessary to probe the US assessment of 
the future of Afghanistan. A break up of Afghanistan will have 
very serious adverse impact on the stability of Pakistan and is 
of serious concern to India. 
  On the nuclear issue the Indian prime minister must seek to 
ascertain the views of the US President on the perpetuation of 
the nuclear divide into five nuclear haves and the rest of the 
nations as have-nots. It must be explained to the US President 
that such a divide in perpetuity will strike at the very root of 
the non-proliferation treaty which both in its preamble and 
article VI has laid down "each of the parties to the Treaty 
undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective 
measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an 
early date and to nuclear disarmament and on a treaty on general 
and complete disarmament under strict and effective 
international control". Therefore India cannot undertake any 
new commitment beyond what it has unilaterally been following 
without knowing how the nuclear weapon powers propose to fulfil 
their obligations under article VI of the NPT even as they 
extend the treaty. Clarification must be sought from the US: 
in view of the shared objectives of India and US in bringing 
about the comprehensive test ban treaty and the cut off of 
fissile materials, should not both countries intensify those 
efforts which in fact would be more effective non-proliferation 
measures than the NPT? 
  The US administration should be requested to increase its 
transparency in respect of the Presidential certification about 
Pakistan not possessing nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive 
devices in 1987, 1988 and 1989. General Aslam Beg and other 
politicians of Pakistan have tended to raise very serious doubts 
on the credibility of those certifications. If the US were to 
play any meaningful role in promoting non-proliferation in South 
Asia then its credibility should not be in doubt. Clinton 
administration has disclosed details about secret nuclear tests 
in the past, radio active experiments on human beings, etc. In 
line with such policy of transparency the opaqueness in respect 
of Presidential certifications of 1987, 1988 and 1989 needs to 
be cleared up. None of these questions can be deemed as not 
being of immediate security relevance to India. 
  Given the present unease in the country the prime minister 
can seize the opportunity to strengthen his own bargaining 
position. He can make a statement in Parliament in which he can 
define his bottom lines on the various issues and indicate the 
possible areas for negotiation. For example, he can state that 
India would not discuss any capping, reduction or elimination of 
its nuclear capability except in the context of a 
nondiscriminatory treaty on the model of convention to ban and 
eliminate all chemical weapons. India is prepared to discuss 
various measures of nuclear restraint on a mutual basis among 
all nuclear capable neighbours in Asia. That will be a 
combination of firm policy with appropriate negotiating 
flexibility. He can always blame Parliament for not being able 
to make concessions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Fairy Tales in US Policy"] </F>
  [Text] There is no mistaking the escalating intimidation of 
India as Washington prepares to receive P.V. Narasimha Rao. 
After the firm reiteration by the Under-Secretary of State, Lynn 
Davis, of the US resolve to go through with the supply of F-16s 
in return for capping Pakistan's nuclear programme, the Chairman 
of the House of Foreign Affairs Committee, Lee Hamilton, has 
fired a more menacing missile at New Delhi. If Davis ostensibly 
tried to put the record straight without undue provocation, the 
high-ranking Democratic Congressman had no difficulty in taking 
a sledgehammer approach. Hamilton convinced himself that the 
cause of nuclear non-proliferation is so great, that he, as a 
prominent law-maker of the lane superpower is entitled to put 
India in its place. Quite forgetting the US's shameful record on 
the subject in north-east Asia. 
  China is unabashedly a nuclear-weapons power and so the US 
has realised the limits of its capacity to brow-beat that 
country into meekly falling in line on the non-proliferation 
issue. But Washington has found it next to impossible so far to 
whip even North Korea into obedience although it is only 
suspected to be trying to achieve nuclear-weapons capability. 
After months of threatening Kim Il Sung of dire consequences if 
he refuses to permit full inspection of his nuclear facilities, 
the Clinton administration seems to be toying with the idea of 
defusing the tension on the Korean peninsula, at least for the 
time being, by going some way to placate the communist dictator. 
What else could be the meaning of the recent statement of the 
Defence Secretary, William Perry, when he says the US aims "to 
try to keep North Korea from getting a significant nuclear 
weapons capability". The climb-down makes a mockery of the 
American alarm over the suspected North Korean nuclear programme 
in the past year. 
  It is difficult to resist the impression that it is 
non-proliferation idealism rather than a realistic appraisal of 
apprehended nuclear dangers that has prompted specific US 
policies towards each area in question. This factor coupled with 
Clinton's desperate need to register a notable foreign policy 
triumph -- especially a clear headway in giving an impetus to 
non-proliferation -- is really behind the American fixation 
about the assumed nuclear confrontation in South Asia. Recently 
Shanghai hosted a conference of experts from China, Pakistan, 
India and the US on the nuclear issue in Asia. According to the 
former lndian Foreign Secretary, A. P. Venkateswaran, Indian as 
well as Pakistani participants in the conference stated 
categorically that there is no likelihood of a nuclear conflict 
between their countries. It is time Clinton took a second look 
at his list of priorities. If he does so sincerely, there is 
just a chance of his realising that there is no case for a cold 
war against India on the nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Talks by Keeping Nation in Darkness] </F>
  [Text] The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the missile 
program are very sensitive issues for India. That is why the 
so-called secret talks with the United States in London were 
enough to provoke the parliament. The provocation was logical 
in the sense that it was borne out of the deep national pride. 
Of course, secret talks have significance in diplomacy, but on 
these two issues a prudent Indian society demands absolute 
openness and full clarification. It is logical to ask as to 
when the parliament is in session, why it was not taken into 
confidence on such an important issue. When a newspaper one day 
suddenly revealed that the government has stopped the 
development program of `Agni' missile, the government springs 
into action and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao makes a statement 
in the parliament that this has not been done under anybody's 
pressure and the program is suspended only temporarily, but the 
answer, perhaps, satisfied no one. The same is true for the 
government's explanation of the secret talks. We do not 
consider the United States a villain, but it is neither a 
trustworthy friend or well-wisher of India. On the U.S. 
direction Russia banned the sale of cryogenic engine technique 
to India that has affected our missile development program. 
When Pakistan has received Chinese M-11 missiles and the U.S. 
F-16 fighter aircraft -- additional consignments are also being 
planned, stopping the missile program by any logic would be 
national suicide. Even though, this was the fourth round of 
secret talks with the United States and the subject of talks was 
the world disarmament, what was the reason for masking them in 
secrecy? And, why were the talks held in a third country? If 
the U.S. delegation had problems coming to New Delhi, the Indian 
delegation could have gone to the United States. Many other 
questions remain unanswered. The delegation members included 
those whose views generally favor India's signing of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. What does this fact indicate? 
Definitely there is something fishy about all this. Then 
again, the London talks took place in the background of the 
scheduled Rao-Clinton summit. 
  There should be no doubt whatsoever that the United States 
wants total elimination of strategic weapons in South Asia. 
While U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott is luring Pakistan 
into capping its nuclear program by promising F-16's, Washington 
has trapped India into multilateral or five plus two plus two 
[the five members of the UN Security Council, Japan, Germany, 
India and Pakistan] talks. Our participation in these talks 
will mean that we are approving the U.S. policies in South Asia. 
The government says that the talks have been held with the 
United States since 1992 for multilateral negotiations on 
disarmament. Okay, but why is India so eager for such 
multilateral talks? It is the government's duty to tell the 
parliament what has been discussed so far with the United 
States. It should also reiterate the commitment that no 
agreement will be reached on India's security and strategic 
interest that is not fully acceptable to the Indian people.

  [Text] The Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan today handed over an American citizen who had 
entered Afghanistan illegally to a Red Cross representative in 
Kabul. According to a report by a BIA correspondent, Mrs. Maria 
Korolov who is a REUTER news agency reporter, had entered 
Afghanistan via Tajikistan. She was arrested by the security 
authorities in Kundoz and was transferred to Kabul. The Red 
Cross expressed appreciation for this humanitarian action 
carried out by the government of Afghanistan+. The Red Cross 
added that Mrs. Korolov will soon be leaving for her home 
country. 
  Meanwhile, the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Islamic State 
of Afghanistan requested that all citizens of foreign countries, 
who intend to visit Afghanistan, obtain a visa through political 
representations of Afghanistan abroad and then enter 
Afghanistan. Otherwise, those who violate the law, will be dealt 
with in accordance with the current laws in the country.

  [Excerpt] In the last two days, the situation in Kabul city 
has been relatively calm and no clashes have taken place between 
the forces of the Islamic Army of Afghanistan and the 
opposition. A BIA correspondent who visited various parts of 
the city today, says that today too, as yesterday, the military 
situation in the city was calm. Taking advantage of this normal 
situation, the people of Kabul were able to obtain their 
supplies of goods and visit their relatives. Although no 
official cease-fire has been declared, there has been no reports 
of occurrence of any fighting. The BIA correspondent, quoting 
official sources of the country, rejects a report by the BBC 
radio concerning the upsurge of heavy fighting and the exchanges 
of missiles, machine-gun, and heavy weaponry that was alleged to 
have taken place in central Kabul yesterday between the 
government forces and opposition. The report was considered as 
unfounded and far from the truth. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] In an article today under the headline "Yemen's 
Unity First," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH stresses that the Yemeni 
people have no interest in the shedding of brothers' blood and 
the destruction of civil and military installations. 
  It says: Certainly, it is not the Yemeni people who ordered 
aircraft and tanks to bombard and shell military units and 
airports in the south and the north. The Yemenis, who restored 
unity to both parts of their country, did so without firing one 
single bullet, and without fighting between military units from 
the northern or southern parts. They have restored the 
confidence of the Arab masses in the possibility of achieving 
comprehensive Arab unity. 
  AL-THAWRAH wonders: Why has the language of violence and 
blood become the only language between parties in the coalition 
government in Yemen? Why has Yemen quickly slipped into a 
comprehensive war, in which the air force, tanks, and other 
weapons were used? This war has claimed the lives of hundreds 
of peoples and inflicted grave losses on the country. 
  The paper says: What is taking place in fraternal Yemen 
confirms that the bloodshed is not in the interest of the 
country. The blood of the homeland's sons is the possession of 
this homeland. Safeguarding Yemen's unity cannot take place by 
escalating the crisis and expanding battlefields. The Yemenis 
have restored their unity. So, why are they forced to separate 
and partition their country with guns and aircraft? Who will be 
responsible for the bleeding from the arteries of both the 
southern and northern Yemeni people? 
  AL-THAWRAH stresses: The Yemeni leadership had better take 
into account the difficult situation the Arab nation is 
experiencing in its battle with Israel, which adheres to the 
ideology of expansion and of fragmenting the Arab nation. This 
is especially true since the bloody Yemeni events will further 
weaken the Arab position, when the nation is seeing cases of 
capitulation to the Israeli enemy, and the reception of its 
civil and military delegations in some Arab capitals. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: In the same way that Yemen's 
unity is the possession of the Yemeni people, it is also the 
possession of the entire Arab nation. The Yemeni leadership is 
responsible for safeguarding and reinforcing it through the 
adoption of principles and the establishment of the state of 
institutions and law. Arabs, through the Arab League, are also 
called upon to stand on the side of their Yemeni brothers and to 
assist them so they can overcome threats to their unity and to 
stop the shedding of their blood. The interest of Yemen and the 
Yemenis must be placed above all other considerations. 
  In its editorial today under the headline "Yemeni Unity Is 
More Important Than People", the newspaper TISHRIN writes on the 
development of the political conflict in Yemen into armed 
clashes in which the air force and artillery are taking place, 
as if the country was heading toward a civil war. 
  TISHRIN says: Syria has several times appealed to the 
brothers in Yemen to resort to dialogue, reason, national logic, 
and pan-Arab conscience, and to reject means of violence. 
President Hafiz al-Asad has more than once contacted Yemeni 
officials and urged them to resort to reason and wisdom, and to 
put the Yemeni people's interests above any other considerations. 
  TISHRIN stresses that the Yemeni people's interests lie in 
their unity, and that a fragmented and bleeding Yemen is an 
element of weakness for Yemenis and the Arab nation. It says: 
Had the Arabs been united today, taking into consideration that 
they are one nation, they would not have been in a weak position 
to sign something that conflicts with their people's aspirations 
and nation's objectives, and to yield to the dictates of 
foreigners, invaders, and those who covet their land and 
resources. 
  TISHRIN adds: The simplest Yemeni or Arab citizen knows full 
well that Yemen's interests lie in its unity and cohesion among 
its citizens. So, how can Yemeni officials ignore this? They 
are supposed to be an example to be followed, not a tool for the 
destruction of the unity of one people. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Syria, along with all Arabs, 
appeals to the brothers in Yemen to resort to the language of 
dialogue and reason, not the language of aircraft, tanks, and 
guns. Nothing is more painful than fighting among the sons of 
the one country. Arabs have in Lebanon's bitter experience 
something which should be an eloquent lesson for anyone willing 
to learn a lesson.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Hariri Stays Away and Refrains </F>
From Carrying Out Any Official Activity"] 
  [Text] Paris, Beirut, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Informed 
political sources in Beirut said yesterday that a new crisis has 
emerged between (President) al-Hirawi, (Chamber of Deputies 
Speaker) Birri, and (Prime Minister) al-Hariri as a result of 
differences of opinion regarding the question of changing some 
ministers and some portfolios in the current cabinet. 
  One of the first results of that crisis, according to 
reports 
circulating in Beirut's political and information circles, is 
that al-Hariri is staying away and refraining from carrying out 
his official duties. 
  It has been learned that the prime minister cancelled a 
television interview which was scheduled to be broadcast on the 
official television network yesterday evening, without giving 
any reasons. 
  Al-Hirawi had, on his latest visit to Damascus, sought the 
opinion of the Syrian authorities regarding the reshuffle issue. 
It seems that Damascus does not favor a complete change of 
government but has no objection to a limited reshuffle in the 
interest of more effective government work to fulfill current 
requirements at home and abroad. 
  It has been claimed that the differences between the 
Lebanese 
state leaders concern individuals as well as portfolios and that 
what is needed is not just replacement of the some of the 
current ministers with new ones but also a change of the 
portfolios of some of the current ministers while at the same 
time keeping them in the cabinet. 
  Some sources hinted that each of the three leaders wants to 
improve his position in the government and increase his share in 
it by having people close to him or considered loyal to him in 
the cabinet. One of the declared aims and reasons for the 
partial and limited reshuffle is to restore the Christians' 
confidence in the government by broadening representation and 
participation in the government through inclusion of individuals 
so far considered to be members of the opposition. 
  The parties tipped to join the government include the 
Phalangist Party led by George Sa'adah and the National Bloc 
Party led by Raymond Iddih. It has been learned that the first 
does not object but the second has reservations and might refuse 
to have one of its members in the cabinet.

  [Text] Lebanese figures continued today to visit Prime 
Minister Rafiq al-Hariri at his home in Quraytim. He received 
ministers Marwan Hamadah, Elie Hubayqah, Muhsin Dallul, Jean 
'Ubayd, and Walid Junblatt at 2000 today. 
  After the meeting, Minister Junblatt stressed that Prime 
Minister al-Hariri wants to give new momentum to cope with the 
political, security, and refugee problems. He said: 
  [Begin recording] [Junblatt] In my view, the prime minister 
is not deliberately staying home but he complains, as we do, of 
certain aspects of the government's performance. We joined this 
government with hopes of becoming involved in development, 
reconstruction, housing, refugees, and security. We succeeded 
in certain areas and did not quite succeed in others, especially 
in the social area, where there are considerable shortcomings. 
I would like to remind you that I was the first official to 
call for a reshuffle or change in this government. All that the 
prime minister wants is to reach this goal, to give this or any 
other government a new momentum to cope with the political, 
security, and refugee problems. I would like to remind you that 
through the security agencies and the Lebanese Army we have 
succeeded in quelling a major sedition in the country. The 
judiciary is doing its work independently of any pressure. All 
that Prime Minister al-Hariri wants is to continue. Perhaps 
there are certain circumstances that I cannot disclose now 
[sentence left incomplete] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] Do you 
expect 
a partial solution to the prime minister's decision to stay home? 
  [Junblatt] I have just given my views on this issue. It is 
up to the prime minister. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Column by Rafiq Khuri: "A `Strike' by a Ruler and the </F>
`Resignation' of a People"] 
  [Excerpts] It is the prime minister's right to rule or 
resign, not to drop his political duties. It is his duty, if he 
cannot rule and resign all at once or if he does not want to 
rule yet does not want to resign, to tell the people why he has 
decided not to perform his duties. Spelling things out is the 
least a man should do. But if this is difficult, the motive 
behind the prime minister's decision to stay home should 
certainly not be to get the various groups to rally round to 
declare their adherence to al-Hariri, to claim that he is 
indispensable. This is the case whether the decision not to 
perform his duties is halfway to resignation or, in the other 
direction, to strengthening his role in office. It is also the 
case whether the outcome is his return to business as usual or 
to changing the people he works with. [passage omitted] 
  The formula is very simple. If what is required is to amend 
the representation of leaders inside the government, then there 
is no need for a crisis over things that neither add to nor 
subtract from the situation. If the objective is to rectify the 
popular representation inside the government, then what is 
needed is much more than just the appointment of two more 
ministers to the Cabinet. The Christian situation in Lebanon 
cannot be resolved through a little game. And the Christian 
situation in Lebanon cannot be resolved without addressing the 
entire Lebanese situation. The Lebanese situation has many 
problems, including imbalanced political and social positions, 
and a virtual absence of national equality. Political life here 
is dormant. The increasing internal and external debts, taxes, 
and fines fall on the shoulders of the poor alone. The Middle 
East peace settlement circumvents Lebanon amid fears that the 
settlement will apply to and include Lebanon. When Prime 
Minister al-Hariri says he can no longer tolerate the situation, 
what should those who are caught in the middle of the struggle 
over power between the warlords and the money barons do? 
  Whatever the case, a public crisis is better than a covert 
one. Perhaps our case is similar to Dr. Kissinger's. After 
heart surgery, he said mockingly: This proves that I have a 
heart. Between their joking and their serious moments, can the 
Lebanese claim that the crisis proves that politics exist in 
Lebanon?

<F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Representatives of the British organisation 
Lloyds Register are expected to arrive in Jordan in two weeks to 
start the process of land-based verifications of 
al-'Aqabah-based shipping which will replace the sea-inspection 
operations expected to end before the end of the month, Western 
diplomats said Tuesday [10 May]. 
  The diplomats said the imminent lifting of the siege on 
al-'Aqabah would open the door for Jordan's resumption of its 
"important" role in the peace process and would allow for its 
participation in the next round of bilateral peace talks 
expected to begin in Washington next month. 
  The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
Jordan has agreed to pay the estimated $2 to 3 million annual 
fees for the non-profit Lloyds Register but the United States is 
insisting that the payments be made through the United Nations 
so that Jordan "will not be able to influence the organisation." 
  They said Washington was also insisting that Lloyds Register 
establish a direct link with the U.N. Sanctions Committee in 
order to supervise exports to Iraq that are permitted by the 
trade embargo on Baghdad. 
  Among other "minor technicalities" still under negotiations 
between Jordan and the U.S. and other members of the 
multilateral interdiction forces enforcing the naval blockade on 
al-'Aqabah is a mechanism through which member countries of the 
force will be able to inspect Lloyds Register's operations, the 
sources told the JORDAN TIMES. 
  Though no Security Council resolution is needed to change 
the 
mechanism through which al-'Aqabah-bound shipping is being 
checked under Security Council Resolution 665, the diplomats 
said consultations among member states of the council are 
required, adding that these consultations are underway already 
in New York. 
  The U.S. on Sunday reportedly communicated to Jordan its 
formal acceptance of the Kingdom's proposal to replace the 
sea-inspection with land-based verifications through a letter 
sent by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  The U.S. decision came few days after France decided to pull 
out from the force enforcing the blockade on al-'Aqabah and 
Canada reportedly rejected an American request that Canadians 
replace the French in this task. 
  The Western diplomats said France saw no reason for the 
continuation of the sea-inspection operations since the 
Jordanian proposal provided a fitting alternative and found no 
justification for Washington's procrastination in implementing 
the proposal which was made by the Kingdom in January. 
  Jordan had earlier linked its participation in the peace 
talks with the lifting of the siege on al-'Aqabah which many 
officials described as pressure on Jordan to force it into 
entering a separate peace accord with Israel. 
  Informed sources say the U.S. Congress, which "has not yet 
forgiven" the Kingdom for its opposition to the Gulf war 
coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991 and some U.S. 
security agencies which "do not trust Jordan" have been behind 
the delay in lifting the siege on al-'Aqabah. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani confirmed Tuesday that 
the Jordanian government has received confirmation from the 
concerned American authorities that Washington had approved the 
Jordanian proposal. 
  He said the next steps were to reach a final agreement with 
Lloyds Register to determined the methods of observing cargo 
entering al-'Aqabah. This might be achieved within the coming 
three weeks, he said. 
  Dr al-'Anani said that the representative of Lloyds Register 
would not be inspecting ships, but will be monitoring incoming 
cargo when they are opened at the port to make sure that they 
conform to the cargo manifests.

<F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordan and the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) begin talks today on detailing the economic 
agreement they signed on Jan. 7. The talks are expected to be 
characterised by "requests for clarifications" before the two 
sides draw the mechanisms for the implementation of the accord, 
particularly that the PLO signed an economic agreement with 
Israel in April after months of negotiations in Paris. 
  Officials said the talks would go deep into the practical 
implementation of the Jan. 7 Jordan-PLO accord and that the 
Kingdom's delegates would be seeking clarifications on the 
implications for Jordan of the Paris accord. 
  Ahmad Quray', head of the economic department of the PLO, 
and 
five other Palestinian economists are expected to be in the PLO 
delegation to the talks. 
  Describing the Jan 7 agreement as a "broad framework 
agreement," PLO officials told the JORDAN TIMES in Jerusalem 
that the two sides should now negotiate a detailed Jordanian-PLO 
economic accord based on the previous broad framework. They 
said amendments may be needed in the accord in light of the new 
powers Palestinians have gained in the Paris economic talks with 
Israelis. 
  "There are answers and details that we would like to have 
from the Palestinian negotiators," said an official, adding that 
only then "can we, in Jordan, play a positive role to serve the 
Palestinian people on a scientific and acceptable basis that 
also protects Jordanian and Palestinian interests." 
  This and other senior officials said Jordan needs to clarify 
details of the PLO-Israel agreement and other economic 
arrangements that the PLO had struck before the Kingdom draws up 
a detailed accord with the PLO. 
  The quest for these clarifications carries in its folds many 
of the fears that Jordanian officials have been trying to keep 
hidden pending the arrival of Mr. Quray' in Jordan. 
  These fears began when the PLO signed the Oslo agreement 
with 
Israel without prior consultation with Jordan and have been 
repeatedly underlined since that time as the PLO shied away from 
committing itself to anything with Jordan before concluding its 
negotiations with Israel. 
  Repeatedly since then, Jordanian officials have been asking 
the PLO to coordinate its steps with the Kingdom to avoid 
hurting the interests of Jordan but at the same time had tried 
to extend support to the Palestinian negotiators so as not to 
undermine their negotiations with Israel. 
  At one time, His Majesty King Husayn issued an ultimatum to 
the PLO calling on it to coordinate an economic agreement with 
Jordan by a set date or all coordination would be called off. 
  In response, the Palestinians showed up on the set deadline 
date and reached the Jan. 7 agreement with Jordan, setting out a 
general framework for economic cooperation that at the time was 
seen as "a letter of intent" rather than a binding agreement. 
  When the details of the PLO-Israel economic agreement were 
first announced, Jordan officially welcomed the agreement as 
having achieved "symbols of sovereignty for the Palestinians." 
  Minister of Finance Sami Qummuh at the time told the JORDAN 
TIMES that the PLO should be credited for making gains that 
underline its independence and he rejected charges that the 
PLO-Israel agreement contradicted the agreement reached with 
Jordan. 
  However, other officials had expressed reservations about 
the 
agreement and questioned its ramifications on Jordan. 
  Mr. Quray', aware of the Jordanian fears, sought to dispel 
them by making statements at the time denying that the agreement 
annulled the Jordan-PLO economic agreement. 
  "It looks like the Palestinians kept us at bay with an 
unbinding economic agreement until they went and strengthened 
their hand with the Israel-PLO Paris agreement," economist Fahd 
al-Fanik said. 
  "They feel that they have a stronger bargaining position 
with 
this Paris agreement," he said, adding that Jordan "now has the 
choice of taking it or leaving it." 
  Another economist, who asked he not be named, said that the 
PLO move to force Jordan's hand with the Paris agreement and 
asking Jordan to agree to a "compatible" agreement with it "is 
an attempt to force us into Benelux-type arrangements." 
  Benelux, a 1960 agreement creating economic integration 
between Belgium the Netherlands and Luxembourg, is an idea that 
was floated as an option for a similar arrangement between 
Jordan, Palestinian territories and Israel. 
  "The Palestinian negotiator is trying to make the Jordanian 
decisionmaker consider the idea of economic integration similar 
to Benelux in terms of making the Jordan-PLO agreement 
compatible with the Israel-PLO agreement," the economist said. 
  "It is very clear that PLO-Israel agreement should not be 
used as a pressure card against Jordan," he said. 
  The Lower House of Parliament's Finance Committee, 
apparently 
in response to the fears created by the Paris agreement in 
economic circles in Jordan, has requested copies of both the 
Israel-PLO economic agreement and the Jordan-PLO agreement as 
well as the Oslo and Cairo agreements. 
  'Ali Abu-al-Raghib, head of the Finance Committee, told the 
JORDAN TIMES Monday that this request came to "hold the proper 
discussions with the government and concerned officials and draw 
a policy that will reflect constructively on the Jordanian and 
the Palestinian people." 
  "There is fear that the Jordan-PLO agreement has become a 
subsidiary agreement to the PLO-Israel agreement," Mr. Abu 
al-Raghib said "when this appears to be the case, it can only 
draw suspicion and depression in economic circles," he added. 
  Mr. Abu-al-Raghib agreed with Jordanian officials that 
"proper elaboration of what happened in Paris is needed." 
Otherwise, he added, "Jordan's mixed economy can only suffer 
and this will reflect negatively on the people both Palestinian 
and Jordanian." 
  "As representatives of the people we cannot sit back and 
watch," he said, making an appeal that the interest of the 
people be dealt with "the highest and utmost responsibility and 
patriotism." 
  "Otherwise it will reflect negatively on both sides," he 
said.

  [Text] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali today 
conferred with Mr. Ahmad Quray', the PLO's Economic Department 
chief. The meeting at the Prime Ministry was attended by Dr. 
Jawad al-'Anani, state minister for cabinet affairs and 
information minister. The sides discussed economic relations 
between Jordan and Palestine and looked into ways to develop 
them further. 
  Meanwhile, the Jordanian-Palestinian economic committee met 
at the Prime Ministry today, with Jawad al-'Anani and Ahmad 
Quray' leading their respective sides. The talks addressed 
economic issues, specifically trade, banking, monetary matters, 
and customs. 
  Mr. Quray' told reporters the committee also had an in-depth 
look at economic issues. The committee is to meet for further 
discussions tomorrow: 
  [Begin recording] [Quray'] Our discussions addressed the 
nitty-gritty of Palestinian-Jordanian economic relations and the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. We agreed that the 
Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement is key to our ties. We 
will have another session tomorrow. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Will the Jordanian-Palestinian 
agreement undergo any changes to suit the PLO-Israeli economic 
accord? 
  [Quray'] Whatever changes are made will enhance the 
agreement. 
  [Correspondent] Meaning there are changes? 
  [Quray'] Whatever changes are made will be to enhance and 
flesh out the agreement. The core of the agreement will remain 
intact. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think a new agreement or new 
protocols may be worked out between Jordan and the PLO? 
  [Quray'] Certain committees may be revitalized. The 
existing agreement is the basis. 
  [Correspondent] What remains to be discussed further between 
you and Jordan? 
  [Quray'] Banking, money, trade, customs -- these are the 
talking points that must be thrashed out in a manner that should 
advance and upgrade the distinguished and brotherly ties between 
Jordan and Palestine. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement limits the scope for your economic cooperation with 
Jordan? 
  [Quray'] On the contrary, I think this agreement has helped 
put the Jordanian-Palestinian accord into practice. True, the 
agreement does not satisfy our demands in full, but the door 
remains open for us to press for our rights, which we will 
regain gradually. The talks focused on the nature of the 
Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. It is now clear and spelled 
out in the agreement. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Information Bureau of the Muslim </F>
Brotherhood in Jordan; date not given] 
  [Text] O ye that believe, betray not the trust of Allah and 
the Messenger, nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to 
you. [Koranic verse] 
  The self-rule agreement signed by the domineering leadership 
of the PLO and the Zionist enemy is the latest regrettable and 
disgraceful chapter in a series of concessions to the Zionist 
enemy that are selling out the rights of the Arab and Islamic 
nations in general and the Palestinian people in particular 
--concessions which include the dearest spot on earth, which is 
second only to holy Mecca and Medina and which represents a dear 
element in our true Islam. 
  The large official Arab and Islamic presence at the signing 
ceremony bore witness to the recognition of the Zionist enemy 
and its usurpation of our sacred territory, including the first 
of the two Qiblahs [direction to which a Muslim direct his 
prayers] and Islam's third holiest mosque. This signing came in 
preparation for the establishment of the Greater Israel project 
and the realization of the dreams of world Zionism and its 
colonialist supporters, which are panting after the wealth of 
the Islamic east. 
  The signing of the self-rule agreement is a clear violation 
of the nation's rights and constant principles, a challenge to 
the will of the Palestinian people, a betrayal of their blessed 
intifadah, and a treacherous act against the Palestinian 
people's steadfast jihad and righteous martyrs. 
  The Muslim Brotherhood declares its denunciation of this 
agreement, as well as its innocence of its provisions, and that 
it knows it will be forgiven by Almighty God because it warned 
and announced to all the Islamic and Arab peoples that it 
rejects this agreement and the likes of it, that it will use 
every legitimate and available means to regain rights, and that 
its stresses the following principles of the Muslim Brotherhood: 
  1. Palestine, as well as all Arab and Islamic lands, are for 
the nation and the future generations, and no one has the right 
to relinquish any part of them under any pretext. 
  2. We condemn and reject all forms of current and previous 
negotiations, as well as all agreements with the enemy occupier, 
as a betrayal of God, His messenger, and the faithful, and as a 
breach of God's orders and the teachings of His messenger, peace 
be upon him, that forbid the relinquishment of any inch of 
Islamic land, let alone Palestine's blessed land. 
  3. Proceeding from our Islamic principles and our commitment 
to our religion and our homeland, we declare our hatred and 
rejection of that agreement and the likes of it, which are part 
of a plan to liquidate the Palestine question and the Arab and 
Islamic causes in the interest of the enemies of Islam, the Arab 
nation, and the homeland. 
  4. We declare our denunciation of the current Arab and 
Islamic participation in opening the doors of the Arab and 
Islamic world to normalization of relations with the Jewish 
enemy and to holding meetings with Jewish delegations as part of 
a series of concessions and relinquishments of the nation's 
rights. 
  5. We reject all forms of surrender to the American program, 
which some Arab leaders are trying to peddle to peoples under 
the pretext of pressures and threats. We also demand that the 
Arab leaders implement their slogans calling for entrenching 
Arab dignity and strength and enabling the nation to be lofty 
and proud. 
  6. We urge the masses of our Arab nation in general and the 
Palestinian people in particular to support the militant forces 
on the land of Palestine, which reject surrender to the enemy 
and which are seeking a total liberation of the Palestinian soil 
from the filth of the Jews--forces which include the Islamic 
Resistance Movement, Hamas. 
  7. We reaffirm that the only way to liberate Palestine and 
all the Arab and Islamic territories and to restore the nation's 
dignity and strength is to launch a holy jihad, which is a duty 
as long as an inch of Islamic land is occupied. Leaders are 
responsible for preparing the future generations for that 
militant duty and for achieving true unity. Any deviation from 
this path will serve the projects of the enemies of God, His 
messenger, and the faithful. But honor belongs to God and His 
apostle, and to the believers, but the hypocrites know not. 
[Koranic verse] God will certainly aid those who aid his cause; 
for verily God is full of strength, exalted in might. [Koranic 
verse].

  [Excerpts] Their Majesties King Husayn and Queen Nur were 
on hand to greet the passengers of two Jordanian Royal Air Force 
planes upon their return from Yemen today. Details in the 
following report by Kassab Samawi from Amman airport: 
  [Begin recording] [Samawi] Their Majesties King Husayn and 
Queen Nur were on hand to welcome back Jordanian nationals, who 
returned to the homeland aboard transport planes of the 
Jordanian Royal Air Force. There were around 300 men, women, 
and children aboard the C-130's, plus a number of Arabs and 
foreigners, that made a nonstop six-hour flight from Sanaa 
Airport to Amman across Saudi Arabian airspace. [passage 
omitted] 
  How was the journey and how did you go about bringing the 
Jordanian nationals from Yemen? 
  [Unidentified pilot] Thanks be to God, we were instructed by 
his majesty the king to fly to Yemen to fly home the Jordanian 
nationals there. We set up the necessary arrangements, 
including preparing the planes, and obtaining the requisite 
clearances to overfly other countries. Thanks to God, we took 
off for Sanaa this morning where we touched down at around 1000 
Amman time. The situation was not exactly comfortable. When we 
touched down the Jordanian ambassador and the military attache 
were on hand to greet us. All the arrangements were excellent. 
We had the passengers get on board fairly quickly so we could 
take off as soon as possible, given the potential risks in view 
of the current state of affairs in Yemen. [passage omitted] 
  [Samawi] Your Majesty the King: Yemen's crisis has always 
been on your mind and you have always sought to keep the 
situation from becoming as it is now. As you receive returning 
Jordanians, would you care to comment on the developments in 
Yemen? 
  [Husayn] I cannot express how saddened and pained I am over 
what is happening, measured against our expectations for the 
reconciliation that we sought to bring about. We call on God to 
spare Yemen further devastation and safeguard the country's 
national unity. I hope Yemen's current troubles will give way 
to a happier era for the country and all our brothers there. 
  [Samawi] Is there anything that Jordan can do at this point 
in time to arrest the deterioration in sisterly Yemen? 
  [Husayn] We will do what we can. A medical team travelled 
to Yemen with the planes that flew there to pick up Jordanians 
from Sanaa. We hope this unnecessary bloodletting will stop. 
  [Samawi] Thank you, Your Majesty. 
  [Husayn] Thank you. 
  [Samawi] A number of wounded from the two opposing sides are 
now receiving medical treatment at the al-Husayn Medical Center 
in Amman. [end recording]

  [Text] More Jordanians have arrived from Yemen at Queen 
Alia Airport, where the prime minister was on hand to welcome 
them back. Details in the following report by Kassab Samawi: 
  [Begin recording] [Samawi] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali led the welcoming party at the airport for 117 
Jordanian and other Arab nationals who arrived from Sanaa this 
evening aboard a Royal Jordanian Airlines plane. The prime 
minister shook hands with each of the Jordanians and Arabs. 
  [Al-Majali] As you know, his majesty the king is 
particularly 
sensitive to humanitarian issues, as much with regard to 
non-Jordanians as Jordanians. Of course, in this case, given 
that there is a large number of Jordanians in Yemen, his majesty 
ordered that military and civilian planes be sent to evacuate 
whoever wished to be evacuated, particularly women and children. 
Four planes have thus far made the trip there and back. We are 
in constant contact with our ambassador in Sanaa to keep us 
posted. His majesty ordered that medicines be dispatched to 
Yemen. A well-trained and well-equipped medical team has 
travelled to Yemen to help out. [end recording]

the sad events pitting brother against brother in Yemen. The 
Senate, the statement said, regrets the high toll of casualties 
and the scale of destruction caused to the infrastructure that 
was built thanks to the sacrifices of the brotherly Yemeni 
people as they marched toward unity, development, and 
construction. The Senate called on the Yemeni brothers to let 
wisdom and dialogue prevail and address the roots of their 
disagreements to preserve the country's unity and spare the 
lives of Yemenis so that they can pursue the process of unity 
and construction and Yemen can continue to play its key pan-Arab 
role.

<F P=106> [Discussion between political correspondents Udi Segal, </F>
outside the Prime Minister's Office, and 'Adi Talmor, in the 
studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Segal] A very brief cabinet session, which 
started at 0900, ended a short time ago. This session was 
convened to ratify the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and the agreement 
was indeed unanimously ratified. The results of the Histadrut 
elections obviously hovered in the air, but political affairs 
were the main issue on the agenda. Minister Yosi Sarid told us 
that even more significant than the ratification of the 
agreement was the determination of a timetable for the transfer 
of powers. The target date is next Wednesday [18 May]; by then 
all the Gaza and Jericho autonomy areas will be transferred to 
Palestinian authority. 
  [Talmor] Am I correct in saying that by that date all the 
Palestinian police forces will have entered the area and the 
Palestinians will be in charge of all the powers and buildings 
in the area? 
  [Segal] More than that. By next Wednesday the PLO will bear 
full responsibility in Gaza and Jericho. This is what Minister 
Yosi Sarid told us several minutes ago: 
  [Begin Sarid recording] The cabinet ratified the agreement 
unanimously. We should pay attention, however, to the 
timetable, because now it is very specific: by Friday, two days 
from now, the Palestinians will take over the southern part of 
the Gaza Strip and all of Jericho. By next Wednesday the 
Palestinians will take over the entire Gaza Strip, that is, Gaza 
city itself and the northern part of the Gaza Strip as well. 
This means that by next Wednesday the Palestinians will be in 
charge of the Gaza Strip and Jericho, as stipulated by the 
agreement. The actual testing of the agreement will start at 
that time. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0800 GMT on 11 May, 
reporting on the cabinet session, adds the following: "Minister 
Shim'on Shetrit said in the session that the agreement signed 
with the PLO deviates from the Declaration of Principles. He 
cited several examples, such as the granting of passports to the 
Palestinians, the ability to legislate basic laws, radio 
frequencies, dialing zones, etc."]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin held consultations 
with Histadrut Trade Union Secretary General Hayim Haberfeld, 
Labor party secretary Nisim Zvili, and Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres a short while after the publication of the results of the 
straw polls which granted the victory in the Histadrut elections 
to Hayim Ramon. Upon leaving the meeting, the prime minister 
told correspondents that the Labor party had undeniably been 
dealt a blow. However, when the correspondents asked him 
whether he intended to call upon Ramon to rejoin the ranks of 
the Labor party, Mr. Rabin pointed out that right now he was 
only commenting on the Histadrut elections and the immediate 
question was which form the internal arrangements inside the 
Histadrut would take. 
  The prime minister said that in his opinion the vote 
reflected the feelings of protest and disappointment of 
Histadrut members following a long period of Labor rule and this 
was a well-known phenomenon. Nevertheless, Rabin stressed that 
he was glad that the votes had remained within the left-wing 
camp while the Likud had received a serious setback. The prime 
minister avoided giving a direct answer when asked about the 
anticipated new political alignments, but reiterated that the 
government and the Labor party had political goals on the 
national level, noting that its leadership would be guided by 
considerations on how to achieve these goals. 
  Hayim Ramon's supporters in the Labor party, members of the 
quintet of Labor Knesset Members [MK's], called on the prime 
minister to permit the return of Ramon and his associates to the 
Labor party. This demand was firmly raised by MK's Ramon and 
Burg. 
  Ramon's arch rival, Minister Shim'on Shetrit, once again 
called Ramon a deserter this evening. Shetrit, however, noted 
that in politics, coalitions are established even with one's 
worst rivals. This implies that the partnership between Ramon 
and the Labor party may be renewed in some form. 
  Some members of Ramon's camp have called for the 
establishment of a coalition with the Labor party Histadrut 
faction, which will apparently receive 30 percent, or slightly 
more, of the vote. 
  Minister Shulamit Aloni said that the Ramon list would be 
prepared to consider such an affiliation. In Aloni's 
assessment, negotiations would start this evening and the Ramon 
list would join with the Labor party. The country is waiting 
for changes in the Histadrut, Aloni explained. Rabin has no 
reason to be concerned. On the contrary, social and economic 
changes would only stand to his credit. Aloni asserted that the 
coalition between SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] and Meretz in 
the Histadrut would be lasting and durable, and presented no 
problems. 
  MK Ya'aqov Shamay, head of the Likud list, congratulated 
Hayim Ramon on his achievement. Shamay noted, however, that 
this did not constitute a political upheaval in the Histadrut 
because Hayim Ramon was still a member of the Labor party.

  [Text] For the first time in 74 years the Labor Party has 
lost control of the powerful Histadrut Labor Federation. In 
elections yesterday, Hayim Ramon's list received about 47 
percent of the votes, compared to Labor's 33 percent, and the 
Likud's 18 percent. Ramon and Labor are expected to form a 
coalition in the Histadrut, as we hear in this report from Dani 
Gur-Arye: 
  [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Hayim Ramon, Meretz, and SHAS 
[Torah Observing Sephardim] did in a month what the Likud has 
been trying to do for 74 years: they knocked the Labor Party out 
of the Histadrut. Ramon dominated among almost all the voting 
groups -- people under 30, pensioners, kibbutzim members, and 
development town residents. In a restrained victory speech, 
Ramon and Prime Minister Rabin agreed to set aside their 
differences. Ramon said: I think that on the basis of what the 
prime minister said, we should definitely continue our 
cooperation. The prime minister made a statement I think is 
important, let's set aside for now the formalities. They are 
less important. 
  Meretz and SHAS members went into a state of euphoria at 
MAPAM [United Workers Party] headquarters in Tel Aviv when the 
results were announced. Ramon watched the news from home, 
joining the celebration after midnight. 
  At Labor headquarters meanwhile, the atmosphere was grim. 
Histadrut Secretary General Hayim Haberfeld and top party 
leaders locked themselves in one of the offices when the results 
were announced, and emerged defeated a half hour later. Once 
the results set in, even Ramon's harshest critics said they 
would be willing to join his coalition. This is Economics 
Minister Shim'on Shetrit: 
  [Shetrit] With regard to coalition, we have made coalitions 
with the Likud, which is totally opposed to our views in the 
political and also in social matters, and I don't think that 
anyone who is sensible could say that he objects to coalitions 
with any group. 
  [Gur-Arye] Haberfeld will continue acting as secretary 
general for the time being. Ramon's party members will take up 
their new positions in August. Until then the two parties will 
have a tough time negotiating a coalition agreement. When it's 
all over, Haberfeld will vacate his office for Hayim Ramon, the 
new secretary general. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Rabin hinted more than once overnight that 
the 
fact that Hayim Ramon, 'Amir Peretz, and Shmu'el Avital remain 
members of the Labor caucus in the Knesset, provides a loophole 
through which to bring them back into the party. The three in 
fact remain Labor Knesset members [MK's] even though they ran in 
a separate list in the Histadrut elections, and they ardently 
support the Gaza-Jericho accord between Israel and the PLO, 
which the Knesset is to debate today and tomorrow. The Knesset 
took the day off yesterday for the Histadrut elections, but is 
back in session today in a new political reality. David Ze'ev 
reports: 
  [Begin Ze'ev recording] The Labor Party is waking up to a 
difficult morning in its parliamentary life, amid the inner 
conflict over whether to allow Hayim Ramon, 'Amir Peretz, and 
Shmu'el Avital to participate in the party's Knesset caucus. 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin himself last night pointed out to 
reporters the awkward situation that while the Labor 
constitution requires the three to be expelled from the party, 
they do remain members of the Knesset caucus due to Knesset 
regulations. Peretz and Avital attended a caucus meeting last 
week. There were some bitter, sarcastic comments over whether 
they should be present, though most of the Labor MK's at the 
meeting seemed to support their bid to continue to be considered 
members. Either way, the three Labor Histadrut breakaways will 
all support the government in the Knesset plenum vote over the 
Gaza-Jericho accord signed last week. 
  The debate over the agreement with the PLO is due to begin 
this morning, resume tomorrow, and last perhaps until the early 
hours of Friday morning. For this debate Meretz will be back in 
the Labor Party's corner, as will SHAS. In the Knesset, Labor 
and Meretz are still in the same coalition, and SHAS is expected 
to be on its way back in. But in that coalition there are 
bitter feelings by Labor leaders towards Meretz. Meretz, which 
for the most part has compromised in the name of the peace 
process, has shown it knows how to confront Labor and win. 
Prime Minister Rabin can take solace only in the fact that 
whenever the marathon debate ends and the vote takes place, he 
is likely to prevail. The Knesset speaker's office has 
announced that the debate will start today, assuming the Prime 
Minister's Office presents before the Knesset this morning the 
Hebrew translation of the accord with the PLO. The English 
version was before the Knesset yesterday. The Knesset speaker's 
office says many MK's came to get a copy, even though the house 
was not in session due to the Histadrut elections. [end

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Knesset Member Hayim Ramon, </F>
secretary general-elect of the Histadrut labor federation, by 
Ya'el Dan; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dan] Mr. Ramon, is the way 
paved for a coalition between your list and Labor in the 
Histadrut labor federation? 
  [Ramon] I hope so. We told the voters that we hope to 
establish a coalition with Labor. I also said as much to the 
Labor party chairman. This position is shared by all members of 
our list. I hope negotiations with the Labor party chairman -- 
who is also the prime minister -- start very soon. I hope Labor 
party leaders in the Histadrut transfer power in an orderly way. 
We must remember that there has been no upheaval in the 
Histadrut since its establishment more than 70 years ago, so 
there is no experience in power changes in this organization. I 
sincerely hope that they intend to implement this changeover in 
the most orderly and smoothest way possible, thus enabling us to 
start working. 
  The way for cooperation with Labor in this issue is paved. I 
assume that I will meet with the prime minister in the very near 
future. For me the most important thing is that the basis for 
such a coalition be our platform, as we promised to the voters. 
Incidentally, large segments of this platform are included in 
Labor's platform for the Knesset elections. The antiquated 
Histadrut bureaucracy, however, prevented the prime minister 
from fulfilling his promises. The best example for this is the 
national health bill; another important example is the national 
pension bill. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The transfer of areas to PLO control will continue 
in the Gaza Strip today. Today they will receive control over 
the Rafah and Khan Yunus areas. Last night the Palestinians 
received control over Dayr al-Balah. Riots occurred in this 
town last night; youths hurled stones at IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] soldiers and fired shots in the air. Electricity supply 
to the Qatif Bloc was cut off last night, but the problem was 
corrected. 
  This morning the Dayr al-Balah area will be officially 
handed 
over to the Palestinians in a small ceremony. Some 150 more 
Palestinian policemen will enter the Gaza Strip today via the 
Rafah border terminal. The IDF is continuing its evacuation, 
which will proceed according to the rate of entrance of the 
Palestinian forces. Our military affairs correspondent Karmela

  [Text] Senior Army sources state that the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] will not transfer any powers to the Palestinians 
in the Gaza Strip today. Yesterday about 140 Palestinian 
policemen entered an installation in Dayr al-Balah, where they 
remain for the time being. Today several dozen more policemen 
are slated to enter the Gaza Strip. Our correspondent Karmela 
Menashe reports that over the next few days more Palestinian 
policemen will prepare in the area for the transfer of power to 
their hands.

<F P=106> [Interview with Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu by Bina </F>
Barzel; place and date not given -- first three paragraphs are 
introduction] 
  [Text] It has been more than a year since Likud leader 
Binyamin Netanyahu argued that "a senior Likud member" headed 
the "mafia" that wiretapped his calls and tailed him. The media 
claimed he was referring to David Levi, and Bibi did not deny 
it. At that time, Levi decided not to cooperate with the man 
who leveled such accusations at him and his colleagues. Since 
then, Levi has hardly set foot in the Likud headquarters at 
Metzudat Ze'ev, and he conducts his political activities from an 
office on Balfour Street in Tel Aviv. Levi was active in the 
municipal elections, in which many of his followers (heads of 
local councils and mayors) ran, but has stayed out of events and 
consultations conducted by Netanyahu or Moshe Qatzav. 
  In a surprising and one-sided move, Netanyahu apologizes 
here 
to David Levi for the distress inflicted on him. He calls on 
Levi to cooperate with him and to patch things up: "I appeal to 
David Levi. If I hurt him, I am sorry about it." 
  Netanyahu's new initiative should be seen in the broad 
context of recurrent secret efforts to renew their dialogue. 
These efforts were conducted by former Knesset Member [MK] 
Re'uven Rivlin, Levi's confidant, and by his brother, Maxim 
Levi. All these efforts have so far proved fruitless. 
  [Barzel] What is your attitude toward David Levi's prolonged 
boycott? Do you not think it is time the two of you made up? 
The animosity between you is so obvious, that not too long ago 
MK Hayim Ramon even had the audacity to propose to Levi to head 
his list in the elections to the Histadrut labor federation. 
  [Netanyahu] In view of the big national challenges ahead of 
us, the Likud and all the other parties in the national camp 
should rise above personal disputes and rivalries. I would like 
to seize this opportunity to call on David Levi to set aside 
past squabbles. If I hurt him, I am sorry about it. Many people 
look up to us and expect us to close ranks in these difficulties 
times. We must act together for the success of the Likud, which 
is so vital to the future of the country. 
  [Barzel] Why the sudden urge? Was not a whole year wasted, 
during which the resentment increased? 
  [Netanyahu] People have their own personal resentments, but 
it seems to me that Israel has never before experienced such a 
period of deterioration in personal safety and confidence in the 
future of the country as that brought about by the government's 
failed policies. This is why I arrived at the clear conclusion 
that this is a fateful hour which calls for special efforts to 
achieve unity. All personal considerations must be tossed aside, 
and everything possible must be done to close the ranks of the 
national camp. 
  [Barzel] How can such an appeal help? What do you expect 
Levi to do? Kiss and make up? 
  [Netanyahu] This is not my first appeal. I took similar 
initiatives in the past, away from the public's eye. I hope 
this appeal will elicit a positive response. 
  [Barzel] All the key positions in the Likud institutions 
have been filled. If Levi heeds your call, how do you envision 
his role in the leadership? 
  [Netanyahu] Some senior Likud members hold jobs, while 
others, such as Beni Begin, chose not to run for any official 
positions but are very well integrated in the Likud's work, 
consultations, and decisionmaking on central issues. There is a 
broad range for cooperation and teamwork for anybody who so 
wishes. 
  [Barzel] Refa'el Eytan proposed to set up a shadow 
government. Were you to set up such a government, what job 
would you offer Levi? 
  [Netanyahu] To the best of my knowledge, the shadow 
government system exists only in Britain, where there is a big 
party in the opposition and there is no coalition. I am not 
sure that the idea can be applied in Israel or that there can be 
a shadow government that includes all the opposition factions. 
It might lead to more divisiveness than unity. 
  On the other hand, I am very much in favor of getting the 
opposition used to teamwork and cooperation. Indeed, this is 
what we have been doing over the past few months, not entirely 
unsuccessfully, as proved by our joint position opposing the 
government's policies and the removal of the Jewish settlement 
from Hebron. 
  It goes without saying that I would not presume to determine 
now the exact composition of the next government, but there is 
no doubt that David Levi would have a dignified and central role 
in it. 
  [Barzel] Have you met with him this past year? 
  [Netanyahu] We have not had any talks worth mentioning. 
  [Barzel] Does the recent appointment of Maxim Levi indicate 
that your mutual confidence has been restored? 
  [Netanyahu] I will not go into an analysis of relations 
among Likud members. As far as I am concerned, I will cooperate 
with whoever wishes to do so. 
  [Barzel] Do you enjoy the cooperation of members of Levi's 
camp? 
  [Netanyahu] I work with all Likud members. We have come a 
long way from the critical situation in the Likud a year ago: a 
shattered movement on the brink of bankruptcy, without any 
institutions. We have fundamentally changed this situation. In 
less than a year, we set up all the institutions that had not 
existed in the previous 15 years. We enacted a constitution and 
appointed a tribunal. We pulled the Likud out of its financial 
crisis, and in recent months, we began activating thousands of 
members. 
  Fortunately, I enjoy the cooperation of all flanks of the 
Likud. This is mainly because of the field activists' eagerness 
to work and take part in the activities needed to curb the 
policies of this government and to replace it as soon as 
possible. This, of course, is not reflected in the media, which 
tries to highlight the divisions and rivalries. 
  For example, there were reports about a mass walkout from 
the 
Likud's ranks. Let me tell you that the Likud is the largest 
party in the country today. At the end of last year, after we 
raised membership fees, no more than 19 percent dropped out, and 
we now have 180,000 paying members. In most parties, the 
typical drop-out rate after primaries is over 50 percent. 
  We built the organizational and financial tools to 
demonstrate this strength in the upcoming struggles and in the 
next Knesset elections. 
  [Barzel] Does the message about the need for unity also 
apply to Ari'el Sharon? He talks about the need for a 
collective leadership. 
  [Netanyahu] Sharon can make quite a considerable 
contribution to the Likud's success if he so wishes. I do not 
understand what the term "collective leadership" means. If it 
means team work, then let me tell you that I regularly summon 
the Likud's institutions and senior members in order to make 
decisions. However, I was chosen by thousands of Likud members 
to lead this team, and that is how I work. The door is wide 
open to anybody who wishes to join in or make a contribution. 
  Furthermore, the negative focus on the Likud is rather 
surprising for two reasons: First, because the Likud is clearly 
undergoing a speedy recovery and is growing stronger. This 
process is corroborated by all public opinion polls, and the 
government is very well aware of it. 
  Second, because divisions and rivalries -- which I do not 
ignore -- are not exactly the exclusive domain of the Likud. 
There is hardly any party in Israel that is not afflicted by 
disputes and rivalries. What is happening today in the Likud 
pales compared to the rivalry in the Labor movement, which 
ultimately led to a rift. 
  [Barzel] Do you think the pullout from Gaza, which many 
right-wing people support, and the contacts with Syria will 
reawaken in the public the euphoria caused by the signing of the 
Oslo agreement? 
  [Netanyahu] The euphoria of Oslo will not recur. The 
government is using the withdrawal from Gaza, which is supported 
by most Israelis, as a smoke screen for a withdrawal from all 
parts of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza and the ensuing return to the 
1967 borders. The people already realize whom they are dealing 
with. The Arabs have not abandoned their ambitions, and they 
take advantage of every retreat on the part of the government to 
fulfill their goals: pursuing terror in the short run, and 
bringing about Israel's annihilation in the long run. 
  [Barzel] Would you pull out of Gaza? 
  [Netanyahu] As prime minister, I would definitely be 
prepared to consider a redeployment of the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] in Gaza and its vicinity. However, there is no way I 
would forgo the IDF's right to enter any place, including Gaza, 
in the course of a hot pursuit, to cite just one example. 
  But Rabin is not just pulling the IDF out of Gaza. He is 
about to establish an army of terrorists there, as well as in 
Jericho, Nabulus, and Hebron. He is handing terrorists the 
responsibility for fighting terrorists, and he is allowing 
'Arafat to establish a state of armed terrorists overlooking a 
shriveled up and dwarfed State of Israel. 
  This is no peace process. This is the process of 
establishing a second Lebanon in the heart of Israel. 
  [Barzel] Even under these conditions, Rabin is having a hard 
time finding partners for a political process. With whom would 
you reach an agreement about the IDF governing Gaza? 
  [Netanyahu] I am not surprised that the Arabs are demanding 
more than even these capitulation terms. They have become used 
to the idea that this prime minister, Rabin, has no red lines. 
All his promises are absolutely worthless. He has promised 
just about everything imaginable. The PLO has not abrogated the 
charter calling for Israel's annihilation and has not stopped 
terror or taken any steps against Fatah men who continue to 
engage in terror and, what is more, who closely cooperate with 
the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] assassins. 
  [Barzel] Why should they talk to you about less than what 
Rabin has already promised them? 
  [Netanyahu] The fact is that when we conducted a genuine 
peace process, the Arabs demanded less and received less, 
because we know how to negotiate with the Arabs. Did al-Asad 
and the Palestinians believe they would get everything they are 
getting today when they came to Madrid? Did anybody conceive 
that the Likud would allow them to have a Palestinian state or 
would give back the Golan? 
  Certainly not, and yet they came nevertheless. 
  When the Arabs realize there is a different government, a 
determined government and not an appeasing one, they will have 
to forgo their exorbitant demands. 
  [Barzel] The current government will soon sign agreements, 
and this looks irreversible. If you head the next government, 
will you honor these agreements? 
  [Netanyahu] We will honor any international agreement that 
is honored by the other side, but there is no way we will honor 
them unilaterally. So far, the PLO has grossly violated all its 
basic commitments. 
  [Barzel] What will you propose to the Palestinians? 
  [Netanyahu] The Israeli public is gradually coming to 
realize that there are two concepts in the search for peace. 
The first, which is being pursued by this government, has it 
that we must withdraw to the 1967 borders, establish a 
Palestinian state, and entrust our security to an army of 
terrorists, led by 'Arafat. 
  I believe in a totally different concept. Israel must keep 
its sovereign rule all the way to the Jordan River. The IDF, 
and not an army of terrorists, must be solely responsible for 
security in all areas of trans-Jordan, and the Arab inhabitants 
of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza will be given autonomy. 
  No autonomy in the world has a flag, an anthem, an army, 
border controls, foreign relations, and judicial and executive 
branches. This is not autonomy. This is a state. And therein 
lies the essential difference between us and the government: 
They are offering a state, not autonomy. 
  [Barzel] Who on the other side will accept the kind of 
autonomy you propose? 
  [Netanyahu] I believe my plan will enjoy significant support 
among prominent elements in the Arab world -- first and 
foremost, Jordan, whose king probably realizes he will not 
survive if a Palestinian state is established in the West Bank. 
Such a state will result in his downfall. I believe a common 
denominator can be found with Syria, which should ask itself 
what it would rather have to its south, in its underbelly: King 
Husayn, or a Palestinian state that would strike an alliance 
with his enemy, Saddam Husayn? 
  [Barzel] Is this the basis on which you expect an accord 
with Syria? 
  [Netanyahu] If I were the prime minister, I would conduct 
the negotiations with Syria in a totally different matter. Who 
has ever heard of a government announcing the concessions it 
intends to make before negotiations have even started? 
  I would tell al-Asad: You stand to lose from a state of war. 
I would elaborate on the issues that are more important to 
Syria than they are to us, such as water, security arrangements, 
striking Syria from the list of terror-supporting countries, and 
an arrangement in Lebanon acceptable to both countries. 
  There is no way I would offer Syria the Golan, which is a 
buffer against war. As long as the IDF is on the Golan with its 
tanks and artillery, the Syrians do not have the option of war. 
  [Barzel] In a few days, the government will sign an 
agreement with the PLO. Even if you return to power, you will 
face a fait accompli. What will you do? 
  [Netanyahu] Contrary to others, I do not think the 
establishment of a Palestinian state is an irreversible process. 
If the government thinks it can race from Gaza and Jericho 
straight to the permanent solution while uprooting settlements, 
it will encounter growing opposition on the part of the public. 
  This is not a nation of idiots. It will not agree to be 
forced back to the banks of the Yarqon River and to deploy 
'Arafat and his terrorists on the hills overlooking Tel Aviv. 
This opposition is being led by the Likud, along with all the 
parties in the national camp. 
  [Barzel] Finally, how do you feel today about your personal 
affair a year ago? 
  [Netanyahu] I am deeply sorry about my personal slipup. I 
hurt myself and my wife, Sara. The media blew the issue out of 
all proportion, to the point of reporting out-and-out lies, 
which definitely did not make things any easier for us. 
  We had quite a tough year, but I believe that in the end, we 
will emerge stronger.

    [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 6 May on 
page B5 carries a 2,000-word interview with Jerusalem Mayor Ehud 
Olmert by Nadav Shragay. The place and date of the interview 
are not given. Asked about Palestinian political activity 
emanating from Orient House and other PLO offices in East 
Jerusalem, Olmert says that the Palestinians are preparing for a 
difficult struggle over Jerusalem, adding that he has already 
warned the government about what is taking place in East 
Jerusalem. He remarks: "I do not know how much determination 
the government is evincing with regard to this issue. Let me 
say with all due caution: I am not claiming that Peres and 
Rabin want to divide the city. It would be unfair and unjust to 
say this, but this does not mean they are doing what is 
necessary to prevent this from happening. They are avoiding 
taking the necessary steps in order not to harm the negotiations 
with the PLO." 
  Asked about steps he would implement in this respect, Olmert 
says: "I would take any step necessary to curb Palestinian 
political activity in East Jerusalem, barring infringements on 
civil rights, such as freedom of speech." He adds: "I would 
close down Orient House, and not only Orient House. I would not 
like to say anything beyond this." Asked about a purported 
secret agreement between Israel and the PLO, according to which 
the Arab villages in Jerusalem will be put under Palestinian 
sovereignty while the new Jewish neighborhoods will remain under 
Israeli sovereignty and the Old City will receive international 
status, Olmert says that such plans are occasionally floated 
unofficially; however, he emphasizes, "I know for certain that 
there is no such agreement or understanding." Asked whether it 
is possible to achieve peace with the Arab states and the 
Palestinians without compromising on Jerusalem, Olmert asserts: 
"The answer is unequivocally affirmative. They never really 
cared about Jerusalem. The city never served as the capital of 
any Arab country. At some future point, they will have to 
decide whether all the great achievements they have scored 
should be compromised in order to realize their demand for a 
political position in Jerusalem. I believe they realize that 
their room for maneuver in Jerusalem is negligible." 
  Queried about his construction and development plans in 
Jerusalem, Olmert states: "If you want to know whether I 
support confiscation of land where necessary for construction 
and development in Jerusalem, the answer is: absolutely yes." 
He adds: "I believe Jerusalem should expand eastward, because 
further westward development would soon turn Jerusalem into a 
suburb of Tel Aviv." Olmert concedes that "naturally, this 
planning concept has political ramifications." Asked whether 
this concept might lead to the conclusion that the city's 
jurisdiction should be extended eastward to include land slated 
to be incorporated in the autonomy, Olmert answers: "This may 
very well be one of the results, and it might be necessary to do 
so in the near future."

under Syrian sovereignty. Moreover, they say they have learned 
that this issue was anchored in the proposals Israel has

  Investments amounting to hundreds of millions of shekels 
continue to be made in the Golan Heights industry, agriculture,

  [Text] A senior political source has told our political 
correspondent Shlomo Raz that Israel sees no point in discussing 
the issues that remain under contention with the PLO because it 
has no intention of acceding to the PLO's demands. 
  The disagreements revolve around the stationing of a 
Palestinian policeman on the Allenby Bridge, a Palestinian 
director at the Rafah border checkpoint, and the size of the 
Jericho enclave. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has 
been informed of Israel's position. 
  On 10 May, the working groups on refugee affairs will resume 
discussions in Cairo. The parties will stress the improvement 
of the refugees's living conditions and refrain from dealing 
with other aspects of the problem.

  [Text] Major General Uri Sagi, the head of the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] Intelligence Branch, has expressed the 
assessment that there will be a decline in terrorist attacks 
from the autonomous areas following the signing of the Cairo 
agreement. On the other hand, the number of terrorist attacks 
from other areas in the territories will rise. Maj. Gen. Sagi 
briefed the members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee today. Our correspondent Hadar Vismonsky reports: 
  [Begin Vismonsky recording] Twenty-four hours prior to the 
beginning of the IDF evacuation of the Gaza Strip and Jericho, 
Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, the head of the IDF Intelligence Branch, 
presented his evaluations regarding the near future to the 
members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 
Sagi believes that the number of terrorist attacks within 
Israel originating from the Gaza Strip and Jericho and the 
attacks against settlers inside those areas will significantly 
decrease. On the other hand, Maj. Gen. Sagi expressed the 
assessment that the level of terrorism will rise in other areas 
of the territories where autonomy is not in effect. Sagi 
explained to the committee members that the PLO has an interest 
in keeping the security situation quiet and will therefore do 
everything to reduce the number of attacks in the areas under 
its control. 
  Maj. Gen. Sagi also commented on relations between the PLO 
and the rejectionist groups, Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], and the Islamic Jihad. Sagi takes a positive view of 
the inclusion of Hamas representatives in the autonomy 
institutions as part of PLO efforts to prevent a Palestinian 
civil war. Sagi asserted that the PLO will attempt to prevent 
the murder of collaborators, noting that this phenomenon cannot 
be completely stopped. [end recording]

  [Text] Here is a report just in: A resident of the Neve 
Deqalim settlement has killed an Arab youth with his firearm. 
This was reported by Palestinian sources. The ITIM news agency

  [Excerpt] Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim 
yesterday told DAVAR that his country would not sign a natural 
gas supply deal with Israel as long as comprehensive peace is 
not established in the region. He added, however, that his 
government would pursue contacts with the Israeli Government to 
discuss the terms of the deal that would be implemented after 
peace is established. He asserted that his country would 
continue welcoming Israeli delegates attending peace process 
conferences that may be held in Qatar in the future. 
  In reply to a question on whether the Qatari Government 
would 
send military representatives to a joint naval rescue exercise 
with Israel and take part in a joint regional communications 
center on military issues, the Qatari foreign minister said his 
government would soon decide whether to participate in these 
projects and on what conditions. He said time was not ripe for 
Qatar to send representatives to visit IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] training installations, and he refused to say whether 
this may happen in the future. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Fahd al-Tayyash: "Kuwaiti Defense Minister: Army </F>
Has Regained 70 Percent of Its Capabilities"] 
  [Text] Kuwait -- Kuwaiti Defense Minister Shaykh Ahmad 
al-Hamud al-Jabir al-Sabah has stated that the Kuwaiti Army has 
regained 70 percent of its capabilities and expected it to reach 
100 percent in the near future. In a statement to AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT yesterday the Kuwaiti minister said that what mattered 
to Kuwait was "to get the best arms from any source because our 
criterion is the quality, not the source, of the arms." In his 
first statement since assuming his new post he said that the 
government would not hesitate to provide everything of service 
to the members of the Kuwaiti Army. 
  In reply to a question about coordination with the Gulf 
states regarding the Peninsula Shield forces, the minister said 
that the defense of Kuwait was primarily the responsibility of 
the Kuwaiti Army, followed when necessary by the role of the 
brothers and friends. He said in that respect that "Kuwait does 
not trust the Iraqi side. Once bitten, twice shy." 
  He affirmed that attention at present was focused on 
preventing infiltration of any Iraqi elements into Kuwaiti 
territory to destabilize its security. He added: "When I was 
interior minister we foiled Iraqi attempts to undermine Kuwaiti 
security and we exposed many such designs at the time." The 
Kuwaiti defense minister also said that his past experience as 
interior minister would consolidate his role as defense minister 
in the present government in providing complete security for the 
public and in ensuring their safety. He added that he was 
confident about the strength of the internal situation, thanks 
to the public's conscious support for the work of the security 
forces.

  [Text] Baghdad, 10 May (INA)--The newspaper BABIL stresses 
that the United States and Saudi Arabia are nurturing the 
secessionist trends to fragment Yemen's unity because of the 
honorable position its government and people took in support of 
Iraq during the great Mother of Battles. 
  In an editorial today, the paper says: The Arab nation's 
enemies want to intimidate the Arab masses with the bloody 
fighting in Yemen in a desperate attempt to bury the dreams of 
unity and the Arabs' aspiration to achieve their comprehensive 
unity. 
  BABIL concludes by saying: The unity which the Yemenis have 
built with their blood and sweat is invulnerable to 
fragmentation. That unity will remain the cure for the wounds of 
sabotage and treachery. 
  The paper stresses that unity and unionists will always 
triumph.

  [Text] Baghdad, May 7, INA -- AL-JUMHURIYAH daily has 
stressed that the current events and the killing in Yemen have 
been arranged by the United States of America and its satellites 
from the Arab reactionary countries. 
  In its editorial today, AL-JUMHURIYAH said that America 
wanted form the killing in Yemen to seize control the oil in the 
north and the south of the country at the same time and the 
current fighting and the plan of its expansion and rooting is a 
direct American act which cannot be implemented by the 
reactionary countries which move within the American orbit only. 
  The paper added that the current American plan in Yemen is 
to 
preserve the formal Yemeni unity to secure the control on all 
Yemeni oil. It went on to say that the regretted events in 
Yemen were no more than implementing a general American-Zionist 
plan. 
  The paper strongly denounced the double standered of the 
American stand towards the Yemeni unity. It also pointed out to 
the Saudi conspiracy against the Yemeni unity following Sanaa 
joining to the Arab Cooperation Council.

  [Text] Beirut, 10 May (MENA) -- Lebanese Prime Minister 
Rafiq al-Hariri has confirmed his insistence on staying at home, 
not carrying out his duties, and clinging to his stance on 
making major changes in his government. 
  In statements made today, he said that he is determined to 
implement his changes and that he will not accept any mediation 
that would keep the government situation unchanged no matter 
what the consequences. 
  Al-Hariri explained that his proposal of a ministerial 
reshuffle by increasing the cabinet members from 30 to 34 and 
enlarging the Christian representation in his new government 
aims to secure the government under unstable domestic and 
regional circumstances and to enhance national unity. 
  The Lebanese prime minister said he seeks to liberate the 
executive authority from interventions and pressure and that the 
country's domestic situation can no longer tolerate the policy 
of settlements and blackmail of the state's interests. 
  In his statements, he disclosed existing differences between 
his ministers' stances, which have caused problems in the 
government's solidarity. He openly charged that some of his 
ministers have been unproductive and contentious and called for 
ending the Christians' boycott of participation in the executive 
authority. 
  Main Christian parties, such as the Phalangist Party, the 
National Bloc Party, and the National Liberal Party, rejected 
participating in any new government led by al-Hariri in the 
presence of the current Chamber of Deputies, which they describe 
as illegitimate after they boycotted the parliamentary elections 
in August 1992. 
  Al-Hariri, who is staying home for the second day, asked 
some 
of his supporters who demonstrated yesterday asking him to 
change his mind about staying home to stop these demonstrations, 
warning of any incidents by some suspicious elements that might 
harm the security situation in the country. 
  The Lebanese Interior Ministry today issued a statement 
banning any demonstrations without prior license. 
  Informed Lebanese circles believe that the current 
atmosphere 
on the street might usher in an open confrontation between the 
legislative and executive authorities since Chamber of Deputies 
Speaker Nabih Birri called today for a plenary session of the 
chamber on 25 and 26 May without defining an agenda for the 
session. 
  These circles fear that the exchange of criticism between 
the 
government officials might escalate, now that the cabinet crisis 
is threatening a political crisis between the leadership of the 
presidency, the Chamber of Deputies, and the cabinet. But some 
optimistic circles expect Syrian Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim 
Khaddam to play a decisive role in resolving this crisis after 
he returns to Damascus from Johannesburg tomorrow evening, 
Wednesday. 
  These circles do not rule out the possibility of holding an 
expanded summit meeting in Damascus attended by Lebanese 
President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Nabih Birri, and Rafiq al-Hariri, as 
well as by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad as a necessary step to 
stop this crisis from escalating.

Decision To Lift al-'Aqabah Blockade"] 
  [Excerpts] Amman -- Authoritative Jordanian sources said 
yesterday that the United States has informed Jordan of the 
decision to lift the blockade imposed on al-'Aqabah port and its 
acceptance of Jordan's proposal calling for sending 
international civilian inspectors to inspect cargoes after they 
have been unloaded in the port. 
  The sources told AL-HAYAH that the U.S. decision, which 
opens 
the door to Jordan's resumption of negotiations with Israel, 
came in a message sent by Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
the evening of the day before yesterday. [passage omitted] 
  Official sources have said that the U.S. decision to end sea 
inspection operations by U.S. ships in the Strait of Tiran 
"removes a major obstacle to an effective Jordanian role in 
reactivating the peace process in the future." King Husayn had 
made it conditional that the blockade be lifted before his 
country can resume peace negotiations with Israel. [passage

<F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to the Knesset </F>
plenum presenting the Gaza-Jericho autonomy agreement with the 
PLO -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Mr. Speaker, distinguished Knesset: In three 
weeks the State of Israel will mark the 27th anniversary of the 
Six-Day War. A generation has passed since that summer morning 
of 5 June 1967 when the code words "Red Sheet" launched the 
planes, tanks, and infantry troops on a just war of defense 
whose military achievements were some of the greatest in 
Israel's history. At the end of the war, in which 800 of our 
best sons and daughters were killed, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
troops were stationed on the bank of the Suez Canal, the border 
of the Jordan River, and on the Golan Heights. As the saying 
goes, failure is an orphan, while victory has many parents. The 
great victory of the Six-Day War was shared by thousands of IDF 
soldiers, and even today each one of them deserves our gratitude 
and appreciation for repelling the danger of extinction from our 
doorsteps. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Speaker, distinguished Knesset, about half of Israel's 
citizens today were not with us in the Six-Day War. They were 
either born or immigrated into a new map of Israel, which was 
drawn by the IDF soldiers in the war, and to new and different 
relations with the Palestinians, the Arab countries, and the 
countries of the world in the aftermath of that war. At the end 
of the Six-Day War, Israel's defense lines were drawn along the 
Suez Canal, on the Golan Heights, and along the Jordan River. 
In our capacity as a military government, we are today also 
responsible for running the lives of 1.8 million Palestinians 
who never wanted us to rule over them and did whatever they 
could to hurt us. Twenty-seven years we ruled over another 
people without making any serious effort to solve the problem. 
Nevertheless, we tried to provide its needs and we ran its 
life, while protecting our own. 
  Through all those years, all Israeli governments, both those 
led by the Alignment and Labor and those led by the Likud, did 
not deem proper to annex the Gaza District, Judaea, and Samaria. 
The late Levi Eshkol, Golda Me'ir, and Menahem Begin, as well 
as -- may they live long -- Shim'on Peres and Yitzhaq Shamir did 
not annex the areas of Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza District to 
the State of Israel. At the end of the Six-Day War, in July 
1967, Jerusalem was reunited and Israel's law and jurisdiction 
was applied to united Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the 
State of Israel and the heart of the Jewish people, which we 
commemorated this week. 
  It is no coincidence that the territories were not annexed, 
even when the state and the government were led by advocates of 
the notion of a greater Israel. Alignment and Labor governments 
knew then, just as they know today, that through the annexation 
of 1.8 million Palestinians the State of Israel would lose its 
Jewish and democratic nature. 
  Mr. Speaker, the current government led by Labor ran in the 
elections and won, with the promise to make a serious peace 
effort, rather than a verbose one; to terminate wars; to try to 
put an end to 100 years of enmity. The current government 
decided to take the first important and courageous step to solve 
the Palestinian-Israeli conflict; to give a chance to peaceful 
coexistence. We believe that the two nations can live together 
with security and peace alongside each other on the same piece 
of land. This was our belief, this is what we talked about, this 
is what we promised, and this is what we will do. 
  On 13 September 1993, a Declaration of Principles [DOP] was 
signed in Washington between the Israeli Government and the PLO 
to establish a Palestinian self-government -- it may also be 
called an autonomy -- in the areas of Judaea, Samaria, and the 
Gaza District. This, as an interim arrangement for five years 
and as a preamble to negotiations about the permanent 
arrangements. The DOP stipulated that in the first stage the 
interim agreement would apply to the Gaza Strip and the Jericho 
area. A month after the DOP was signed, negotiations began in 
Taba between Israeli and PLO delegations on the implementation 
of the first stage, the Gaza and Jericho stage of the interim 
arrangement. 
  The negotiations on Gaza and Jericho centered on four types 
of issues: The security sphere, on which I will dwell at 
length; the civilian sphere -- the transfer of powers from the 
Civil Administration to the Palestinian authority; the legal 
sphere -- defining the legal infrastructure, legislative 
procedures, and legal powers in the areas of the Palestinian 
authority and relations in this sphere with Israel; and the 
economic sphere, on which deliberations were held in Paris, to 
determine the economic relationship between the Palestinian 
self-government authority and the State of Israel. 
  The negotiations on Gaza and Jericho were fraught with 
difficulties, mainly in the security sphere and due to Israel's 
insistence on arrangements which would enable it to exercise its 
responsibility for external security, the security of Israelis, 
the security of Jewish settlements. We insisted on it! No 
settlement will be uprooted! Does this remind you of something? 
  The negotiations were completed after seven months of talks, 
and the Gaza-Jericho agreement was signed in Cairo last week, on 
4 May 1994. The government today placed on the desks of the 
members of the Knesset [MK] the Hebrew and English versions of 
the agreement and its attendant maps. Of course, an arrangement 
has been made whereby the maps will be displayed in the meeting 
hall of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and a senior 
officer will give explanations. There is no secret agreement, 
there are no unpublicized appendices; everything is in the open 
and on the table. 
  To the MK's, and through them to Israel's citizens, I must 
say: In the long and tiring discussions into the wee hours and 
during long weeks, we meticulously and primarily insisted on the 
security needs of the State of Israel and its citizens, out of a 
desire to be free of running the lives of the Palestinians and 
endangering the lives of IDF soldiers in the streets of Gaza. 
This was our main concern. 
  Members of the Knesset, what does this agreement contain? 
The DOP stipulates that during the interim period the State of 
Israel will continue to be responsible for defense against 
external threats and for the general security and public order 
of Israelis wherever they may be, and of the Israeli settlements 
in the Gaza Strip. It further stipulates that the powers of the 
Palestinian authority will not include external security, the 
security of Israelis, the security of Israeli settlements, 
foreign relations, and other issues. 
  How will we go about implementing it? We will do it through 
various means: through control and supervision mechanisms along 
the borders and the roads, at the crossing points between the 
areas of the autonomy -- or Palestinian authority -- and Israel, 
and at the border crossings; through control of the air and sea 
spaces, joint patrols, a liaison and coordination mechanism, and 
through the redeployment of the IDF in and near the Israeli 
settlements. All these controls are anchored in the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. They leave in Israel's hands all the 
tools necessary to meet our security needs in the best possible 
way in the new reality that will emerge in the field. All this, 
in addition to the mutual interest and commitment contained in 
the DOP and in the Gaza-Jericho agreement to peaceful and secure 
coexistence; to prevent terror, crime, and violence; and to 
coordination and cooperation arrangements. 
  Where does the agreement apply? The Gaza-Jericho agreement 
applies to the entire Gaza Strip and to a defined area around 
the city of Jericho. The territory to remain under Israel's 
responsibility in both areas has been demarcated. The maps of 
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, which are appended to the 
agreement and are an integral part of it, demarcate the various 
areas of jurisdiction. According to the agreement, the IDF will 
begin pulling out its troops from the autonomy area -- or 
Palestinian authority -- in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area 
upon the signing of the agreement and will complete its 
redeployment shortly afterward, within three weeks or even less. 
In order to meet this tight schedule, the IDF began preparing 
for a pullout and a redeployment even before the negotiations 
were wrapped up. The redeployment will apparently be completed 
within a few days. 
  Members of the Knesset, the agreement does not exist that 
pleases everybody. There is no agreement that does not entail 
compromises and concessions on both sides, if one wants the 
agreement to be fulfilled by the two sides. There is no 
agreement that does not entail certain risks. Such is the 
agreement placed on your desks. Nevertheless, we are convinced 
that in the new conditions we attained the maximum possible as 
far as security is concerned. Anybody who reads the details of 
the agreement and is honest with himself will at least have to 
admit that the concern for Israel's security and the security of 
the Israelis and the settlements is evident in every line and 
word. 
  What is in the agreement? With your permission, I will 
give some details. The agreement gives Israel absolute 
authority regarding a response to external threats. Let us not 
forget -- external threats, foreign military threats, are the 
only threat to Israel's existence. Israel continues controlling 
an uninterrupted military territory along the border with Egypt. 
This strip remains under our exclusive authority. The Jericho 
area is not close to the Israeli security zone, under the IDF's 
control, along the Jordan River. We maintain full control over 
the airspace and military control over the territorial waters is 
in our hands. 
  The Palestinians will have a policing authority regarding 
civilian issues, subject to several constraints. Israelis will 
manage the international border crossings. Israel will be able 
to supervise the entrance of persons into the territories 
through the Palestinian terminal as well. 
  What else is in the agreement? The agreement includes 
arrangements which allow reasonable protection of the 
settlements and the settlers. Placing the settlements in blocs, 
that is, demarcating the settlements that can be put in blocs, 
allows blanket protection of most of the settlements in the Gaza 
Strip, with the exception of two isolated settlements. 
Naturally, the IDF is being deployed along the fence erected 
for the protection of the bloc, for its safety. Israel has full 
powers of operation, which allow it to do whatever is necessary 
to provide for the security of Israeli traffic on the main 
routes to the settlements and the adjacent areas. In the blocs 
of settlements there is also Palestinian territories adjacent to 
the settlements over which Israel has full security powers. 
They are called, by us and on the maps, yellow territories. 
Constraints on Palestinian building and other issues will 
prevail in those territories. Undisturbed Israeli movement was 
secured in parts of the routes under Palestinian security 
authority through the employment of joint patrols; for example, 
the routes crossing Jericho and the Qatif Bloc-Netzarim axis. 
  What else does the agreement include? It includes an 
arrangement ensuring effective protection of the borders of 
Israel and Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. Security 
criteria were defined in which construction and introduction of 
arms were placed under constraints and supervision in those 
regions as well. Furthermore, the Palestinian police has no 
authority over Israelis. The size, types of arms, and 
deployment of the Palestinian police were agreed on. Bringing 
in arms others than those allowed was banned. We will screen 
the Palestinian policemen and only those we approve of will be 
allowed to enter the territory. An apparatus of cooperation and 
coordination with the Palestinian police was set up. The 
Palestinians made a commitment to act and prevent terror against 
Israel from, naturally, the area under their control. 
  We are aware of the fact that terror has not stopped and 
continues to harm us. We hope that, upon the assumption of 
control by the Palestinians in the regions of Gaza and Jericho, 
they will take measures to prevent terror, or at least 
significantly reduce the damage it causes. We regard this as a 
main test of the Palestinian police and authority established by 
the agreement. 
  I will present to you and perhaps elaborate on several 
points of the agreement: The agreement includes clear 
instructions regarding the duties of the Palestinian police in a 
bid to prevent friction and to make sure that the Palestinian 
police -- in terms of the number of its men and types and 
quantities of arms and equipment in its possession -- indeed 
functions solely as a police force and prevents attacks against 
Israelis to the extent possible. A coordinated network of local 
and regional liaison committees, which are being set up these 
very days, will ensure cooperation and coordination between the 
parties on a long-term basis. They will work around the clock 
to immediately handle any problem and to allow for coordination 
between the Palestinian police and the Israeli security 
authorities in charge of overall security and the protection of 
Israelis who reside in the settlements. 
  The Gaza-Jericho agreement contains instructions regarding 
the Temporary International Presence [TIP] in the regions of 
Gaza and Jericho. The instructions will be detailed within a 
given amount of time. This body will be made up of no more than 
400 men from five or six countries. The TIP will be financed by 
the donor countries and will function for an initial period of 
six months. 
  True, in a bid to create a positive atmosphere and a basis 
of 
confidence between the parties, Israel agreed to release or hand 
over to the Palestinian authority some 5,000 Palestinian 
prisoners and detainees, but only those who have not caused 
Israeli casualties. There will be none among them who were 
arrested for engaging in hostile terror activities after the DOP 
was signed on 13 September 1993. Members of the rejectionist 
organizations who will be released will have to sign a 
declaration of support for the DOP and abstention from violence 
and terror. So far, more than 400 such prisoners have not 
signed the documents and were not released. We will not free 
prisoners who belong to organizations that declare their 
opposition to peace, such as Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. 
  Members of the Knesset, the agreement is very complex and 
very detailed. It is almost impossible to absolutely prevent 
misunderstandings and friction at the beginning. In time, we 
will learn how to live together from the reality created on the 
ground. The civilian appendix to the agreement speaks of the 
establishment of a joint committee for cooperation and 
coordination, which is designed to coordinate the transfer of 
civilian authorities and allow daily contacts between the 
civilian authorities of both parties. This committee will solve 
problems that might emerge regarding the joint use of roads, the 
electricity and telephone lines, the crossing points into the 
territories of Gaza and Jericho, the areas beyond the borders, 
and travel to and from Israel. 
  Members of the Knesset, in hundreds of pages, hundreds of 
clauses and subclauses, the agreement tries to encompass all 
aspects of the relations between the two nations. For example, 
the civilian appendix covers 38 areas in which civilian 
authorities are being transferred from the Israeli Civil 
Administration to the Palestinian authority in the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho region. In some of those areas, the management and 
administrative authorities will be fully transferred. In others 
areas -- such as religion, archaeology, water, electricity, 
construction and planning, telecommunications, postal services, 
and population registration affairs -- the transfer of powers 
will be subject to certain constraints in order to secure 
essential Israeli interests and ensure the orderly supply of 
energy, water, and means of communication and to provide free 
access to the Israeli settlements. 
  Members of the Knesset, in view of recent events, I must 
stress that freedom of worship at and access to sites sacred to 
the Jews was secured. The protection of all archaeological 
sites in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region was secured. 
Furthermore, there will be free access to those sites. A joint 
committee of archaeology experts will be set up. It will deal 
with matters of common interest regarding any issue that may 
impact on the Jewish sites. Naturally, very high standards, 
equaling our national standards, were set regarding protection 
of the environment, and I will not elaborate. 
  If this is not enough, the agreement also stipulates that 
the 
Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region 
will be issued identity cards in Arabic and Hebrew, based on the 
existing population registry, which, with Israel's assistance, 
will be updated on an ongoing basis and computerized. I will 
stress here, and return to this issue later, that the 
registration of Palestinians residing abroad and the issuance of 
tourist permits for them is subject to Israel's agreement. 
  What else can you find in the agreement? The maintenance of 
the electricity, water, and telephone infrastructures in the 
Israeli settlements and IDF camps in the Gaza Strip and the 
Israeli infrastructure in the Jericho region will remain in 
Israel's hands. The maintenance will be performed by the Israel 
Electricity Company, Meqorot, and Bezeq. The supply of those 
services to the Israeli settlements and the IDF camps will, 
therefore, be independent of the Palestinian authority. 
  The third appendix to the agreement deals with legal and 
judicial issues. It deals with matters pertaining to criminal 
and civilian judicial authorities and with reciprocal assistance 
between the Israeli and the Palestinian legal authorities. The 
legal appendix stipulates that the Palestinian authority will 
not have -- I repeat, will not have -- powers with regard to 
Israeli citizens, Israeli settlements, and the area where the 
military installations will be located. This means that the 
Palestinian police will not be able to detain Israelis, and the 
Palestinian courts will not try them. Israel alone will have 
this power, as before. Furthermore, Palestinians who harm or 
attempt to harm Israelis in the regions under Israeli authority 
and who are captured by the Israeli security authorities will be 
questioned by Israel. The decision on whether such criminals 
will be tried by Israel or the Palestinian authority will be 
determined by both parties, which will consider each case on an 
individual basis. I must note here that even if an Israeli 
commits a crime in the area under the authority of the 
Palestinian authority -- for example, on the streets of Gaza -- 
it is the duty of the Palestinian authority to detain the 
suspect and call the Israeli authorities, which alone have the 
power to arrest him and keep him in custody. 
  The fourth and last appendix to the agreement deals with 
the economic relations between Israel and the Gaza and Jericho 
regions. It details import policy; import taxation; monetary 
and financial policy; direct and indirect taxation; and the 
economic aspects of labor, agriculture, industry, tourism, and 
car insurance. For example, the entry of goods into the 
territories through the border crossings with Jordan and Gaza 
will be controlled jointly by Israeli and Palestinian customs 
officers. The entry of personal luggage of travelers coming to 
the territories through these crossings will be controlled by 
Palestinian customs officers under the unseen presence of 
Israeli customs officers, who will be entitled to request to 
check it. The Israeli shekel will continue to be one of the 
legal tenders in the territories to be used for any purpose, and 
the Palestinian authority and its institutions, local 
authorities, and banks will have to accept it as a means of 
payment. Deliberations about minting a Palestinian currency will 
continue in the framework of the economic committee, and at this 
point, such a currency does not exist. 
  I will not elaborate on the arrival of tourists, to which I 
attach great importance, because tourism may serve as a good 
means for getting to know each other better. Both sides are 
interested in it. 
  As far as labor is concerned, there will be normal movement 
of laborers between the two sides, subject to our and their 
right to determine their numbers and subject to legislation. 
The placement of workers in Israel will be done only through 
the Israeli Employment Service. 
  Many reports, words, and headlines have been written in the 
last few days about one clause in the agreement: that which 
deals with the return of displaced persons to the territories. 
I heard and read many inaccurate -- I would say even false and 
misleading -- reports, and I can only blame those who 
consciously misused and misrepresented the facts. Here is the 
truth, the whole truth, on everything pertaining to the return 
of displaced persons: The Gaza- Jericho Agreement stipulates 
that a liaison committee consisting of Israel, the Palestinian 
authority, Jordan, and Egypt will be established to deal with 
issues of common interest and to decide on the principles 
concerning the entry of persons who left Judaea and Samaria in 
1967. Take note: We are not talking about refugees from 1948 
but about people displaced in 1967. 
  Now, I will reveal a secret to the Knesset and to those 
Israeli citizens who do not know it: This clause was copied 
verbatim from the Camp David accords, written and signed by the 
late Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin. 
  This clause does not stipulate how many people will be 
allowed to return to Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, and all the 
figures floated this week were totally unfounded. This clause 
stipulates that all the decisions on this issue must be made 
unanimously by all the members of the committee. In other 
words, without Israel's agreement, the committee will not be 
able to determine how many people will be allowed in and in what 
stages. The clause further states that the committee must 
decide on the necessary means to prevent pandemonium and 
disorder. This addendum, which was also copied from the Camp 
David accords -- for which we owe our gratitude to the prime 
minister at the time, the late Menahem Begin -- is meant to be a 
means of control to ensure that people are not allowed to enter 
the area without being assured in advance of proper housing and 
livelihood. 
  Members of the Knesset, I would like to bring to your 
attention that an attendant letter from the chairman of the PLO 
to the Israeli prime minister was appended to the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement. In this letter, the PLO undertakes, among other 
things, to make sure that the Palestinian authority and all the 
institutions subordinate to it act in accordance with the 
agreement. The PLO also undertakes to cooperate in locating the 
whereabouts of Israeli MIA's. Further on in his letter, the 
chairman of the PLO reaffirms his intention to present the 
changes in the Palestinian Covenant for the approval of the 
Palestine National Council at its next session, as he undertook 
to do in the DOP. In this exchange of letters, the two sides 
also undertake not to change the status of Gaza and Jericho in 
the interim period and to abstain from incitement and hostile 
propaganda against each other. In the same letter, the sides 
agree to pursue the negotiations on outstanding issues, 
including the size of the Jericho autonomous area, the 
stationing of a Palestinian official on the Allenby Bridge, and 
other arrangements at the Rafah terminal. 
  Mr. Speaker, distinguished Knesset, all parts of the 
agreement have been placed on your desks. We believe it is a 
good agreement -- good for us and good for the Palestinians. 
Therein lies the chance for its success. 
  Members of the Knesset, this is the time to thank from the 
bottom of our hearts thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, 
of IDF soldiers in all branches, the Shin Bet, the Border 
Police, Israel Police personnel, and generations of Civil 
Administration workers, who for decades did a faithful and hard 
job, a tiring and dangerous task in Gaza and Jericho. I hereby 
proclaim without any hesitation whatsoever that no other people 
in the world, no other nation or tribe, has engendered such sons 
and daughters and elicited from them such valor and tenacity to 
defend all of us in a situation of unparalleled complexity. The 
right word does not yet exist in the lexicon to express so much 
gratitude and appreciation to these wonderful people. I will 
derive great pleasure from seeing the IDF soldiers getting out 
of the streets of Gaza, Jabalyah, al-Shati', the al-Nusayrat and 
al-Burayj refugee camps, Dayr al-Balah, Khan Yunus, and Rafah. 
They have nothing to do there, and nobody has the right to 
endanger their lives just to be there! Nobody! I am proud that 
this government is bidding farewell to al-Shati', Jabalyah, 
al-Nusayrat, al-Burayj, and Gaza. 
  This is also the time and place to treasure the memory of 
dozens of soldiers and civilians, male and female, who died in 
Gaza and Jericho; fighters who were there to fulfill their 
duties and civilians who paid with their lives only because they 
were Jews and Israelis. We remember them with love: the 
children of Pretty and Bob Arroyo, Amnon Pomerantz, Rahel Weiss 
and her three children, Shahar Ginosar and Ibrahim Shabal, Me'ir 
Mintz and Gal Avino'am, Doron Shorshan and 'Adnan Bu'ad, Rabbi 
Shim'on Biran and Asad Wafa, Barukh Ben-Shim'on and Doron 
Derezi, and many others whose names were not mentioned today. 
For them and their families, who will not forget till their 
dying day; for the fathers and mothers; the wives and children 
they left behind, this agreement came too late. We cherish 
their memory with love and believe and hope that their terrible 
sacrifice was not in vain. Amen! 
  This is the place to wish a speedy recovery to those injured 
and maimed in the last decades, many of whom are to this day 
struggling with their pains and scars. [heckling by Likud MK 
Limor Livnat about the fate of Israel's MIA's] 
  I do not want to talk about the MIA's from the al-Sultan 
Ya'qub battle, because if I did I would have to disclose why 291 
Syrian soldiers were handed back unconditionally. I do not want 
to deal with this subject today. 
  Mr. Speaker, distinguished Knesset, in a bid to break the 
cycle of murder, end the endless bloodbath, and bring security 
to us and to them, we did something. We took the first step, 
which we believe and hope will lead us and our Palestinian 
neighbors to peace and tranquillity, even if there is still a 
long way ahead of us. We did not do it frivolously or 
carelessly. We believed and we continue to believe today that 
we did the right thing for the sake of children and 
grandchildren on both sides, for the sake of the peace to come. 
I am hereby asking the Knesset to take note of the government's 
announcement.

May carry straw poll results of the Histadrut Trade Union 
elections. Polling booths were closed at 1900 GMT. 
  Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew

which reads: "Hayim Ramon, head of the New Life in the 
Histadrut list, won 49 to 50 percent; Hayim Haberfeld of Labor 
received only 32 percent; the Likud representative Ya'aqov 
Shamay won 15 percent of the vote; and Binyamin Gonen received 
three percent. This is an unequivocal victory of Ramon's list."

  [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that certain snags have 
prevented the visit of a high-level Palestinian political 
delegation to Baghdad. Primarily, Iraqi President Saddam Husayn 
has apologized for being unable to receive the delegation at 
present. 
  On the other hand, a Palestinian military delegation, which 
has been visiting Baghdad for more than two weeks, discussed 
technical issues only at the level of liaison officers between 
the forces of the Palestine Liberation Army and the Iraqi Army. 
  The troops of the Palestine Liberation Army deployed in Iraq 
will be the first to enter Jericho through Jordan this week. 
  Iraq did not agree to allow these forces to leave and to 
take 
along all their weapons. It allowed them to carry personal 
weapons only, that is, a pistol for officers. It also allowed 
them to carry 60 rifles as they leave the Iraqi-Jordanian border. 
  The PLO tried to acquire light weapons and ammunitions from 
Jordan. While discussing this issue, Greece said it was willing 
to provide the Palestinian police force with light weapons.

<F P=106> [First of an unspecified number of installments of an </F>
exclusive interview with Tariq 'Aziz, Iraqi deputy prime 
minister, by MILLIYET correspondent Nur Batur in Baghdad; date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Batur] The embargo's effects on Iraq are gradually 
becoming more serious. Why have you not agreed to the UN 
proposal for the sale of oil worth $1.6 billion? 
  ['Aziz] UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 do not 
allow Iraq to meet its basic needs because they call for the 
allocation of a significant amount of the profit from the sale 
of its oil for the UN personnel's expenses and for compensation 
to the countries that incurred losses as a result of the war. 
The two resolutions were drawn up in order to place Iraq under 
UN control. The objective is to interfere in Iraq's internal 
affairs. We definitely cannot agree to all that. The two 
superpowers do not wish to alleviate the Iraqi people's pain. 
  [Batur] Would Iraq's compliance with the UN resolutions not 
provide for the relaxation of the embargo to a certain degree? 
  ['Aziz] No, it would not. Had conditions not been imposed, a 
way could have been found to move away from the embargo. 
However, their objective is to create instability in Iraq. 
  [Batur] Turkey still fears that the Kurds may be forced to 
emigrate once again if the security umbrella over them is lifted. 
  ['Aziz] I have been informed of that viewpoint several 
times. 
We are prepared to give any kind of guarantee that a new wave of 
emigration will not take place. The Iraqi Administration stands 
to gain nothing by resorting to military measures to resolve the 
Kurdish problem. That problem cannot be resolved through 
military measures. We have had incidents for the past 25 years. 
A political solution is necessary. That is the guarantee we 
can give. 
  [Batur] Karkuk is a key problem between the Kurds and 
Baghdad. Do you plan to give a share of Karkuk to the Kurds when 
the talks are resumed? 
  ['Aziz] No, we do not. Talks cannot be held on Karkuk. 
  [Batur] What would you do if the Hammer Force's mandate is 
broadened to include Karkuk? 
  ['Aziz] We shall resist such a move. 
  [Batur] Will that be in the form of military resistance? 
  ['Aziz] We shall resist in every way. 
  [Batur] The strength of Iraq's military forces is a matter 
of 
concern. Baghdad made certain statements in the past, the 
nature of which was to threaten Turkey. 
  ['Aziz] The target of those statements was the leaders who 
sided with the allies at the time. 
  [Batur] You mean former President Turgut Ozal? 
  ['Aziz] I do not wish to criticize a person who has passed 
away. However, that was the situation at the time. Had we 
taken a negative approach to Turkey, would we have agreed to 
joint projects with it? Nevertheless, the question of water 
supply is an important matter. It must be resolved in 
accordance with the two countries' interests. 
  [Batur] You have claimed that Turkey has been used by the 
United States. 
  ['Aziz] I believe that Turkey has made a historic mistake by 
joining the alliance against Iraq. Turkey is an Islamic 
country. Do not forget that it is one of Iraq's neighbors. 
Neighbors must respect each other's independence. Turkey has 
now begun to pay the price of its move to join the alliance 
against Iraq. 
  [Batur] What is the political cost? 
  ['Aziz] Was it right on Turkey's part to join an alliance 
against one of its neighbors? You may not have approved of what 
we had done. However, you should have said so. Why did you 
join the military operations launched by the United States, 
Britain, and other Western countries? The objective of the 
military operations was not to force Iraq to withdraw from 
Kuwait; it was to destroy Iraq. Did you stand to gain anything 
from that? 
  [Batur] What do you expect from Turkey? 
  ['Aziz] We wish to maintain our favorable and mutually 
beneficial relations. Turkey continues to observe the UN 
embargo. That conflicts with its own interests. Turkey has 
suffered significantly as a result of this. It has the right to 
act and adopt decisions in accordance with its interests. 
  [Batur] Are you saying that Turkey can ignore the embargo by 
itself? 
  ['Aziz] The UN Charter allows countries that suffer to act 
individually to safeguard their rights. We are your friends and 
neighbors. The past must not be allowed to affect our 
relations. Iraq remains on its feet and it will continue to 
exist. So, the Turkish Government should move to reestablish 
its relations with Iraq as soon as possible. 
  [Batur] Claims have been put forward that Baghdad supports 
the Kurdish Workers Party and its leader, Abdullah Ocalan. 
  ['Aziz] No, it does not. 
  [Batur] Abdullah Ocalan has reportedly visited Baghdad. 
  ['Aziz] That, too, is untrue. We do not stand to gain 
anything by destabilizing Turkey. We are not involved in plots. 
Plots are being made against Iraq, but we do not act in a 
similar way. 
  [Batur] Who is making plots against Iraq? 
  ['Aziz] Those who directly or indirectly support the 
abnormal 
and false situation in northern Iraq. We are suffering from 
that situation. Nevertheless, we have the experience we need, 
so we do not maintain a two-faced policy. 
  [Batur] Does Turkey maintain a two-faced policy toward Iraq? 
  ['Aziz] Yes, some of the officials in Turkey do.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Mu'ayyad 'Abd-al-Zahrah: "The Others </F>
and the Brunt of the Blockade"] 
  [Text] When we look at the international stands on the 
unfair blockade against our country and people, we find that the 
picture today is different from what it was yesterday. What 
once looked ike international unanimity is now nothing more than 
deception and a ploy Washington imposed on everyone by 
temptation and intimidation. 
  Therefore, it is not strange to see Turkey lamenting its 
poor 
economic conditions and calling for help, and to watch Bulgaria 
speaking bitterly and cynically about the over-rich who no 
longer dig into their pockets. On the other hand, France is not 
hiding its bitterness about the so-called U.S. "reward" and the 
loss of its markets and friendships. Russia has not ceased 
complaining about the brunt of the damage it has sustained due 
to its support for the blockade. The same can be said about 
conditions in Germany, Greece, and many other nations. The 
unfair blockade imposed on our people by U.S. domination and 
influence in international decisions has become a cause for 
resentment and a source of great economic pressure in many 
nations due to the political stands they once adopted. 
  Those who went along with the blockade and abided by its 
policy did not, in the worst or best conditions, realize it 
would take such a long time, and that the "booty" they had 
expected would not be worth their blessing or silence, instead 
of their objection or protest, especially since they had already 
been paid for their stands in advance and were compensated by 
both the Saudi and Kuwaiti treasuries for some time and later 
threatened by the United States if they tried to breach or 
ignore the unfair resolutions. 
  Iraq's steadfastness and endurance, thanks to its 
leadership's ability and wisdom and its people's awareness, 
cohesiveness, and will power, have been and still are the main 
decisive factors in exposing and unveiling U.S. policies. This 
legendary steadfastness was the potent weapon that eroded and 
mutilated the logic of domination and made many countries 
reconsider their stands on the basis of their national 
interests. Their unjustifiable drift behind Washington's policy 
all those years has led to incalculable negative results, the 
least of which are the closure of factories, the bankruptcy of 
companies, increasing unemployment, mounting economic losses, 
and the loss of many markets in the area. 
  If a number of French officials have admitted the enormous 
losses France has incurred as a result of drifting behind 
Washington's policy, Russia's losses are even greater in the 
economic and the political spheres. 
  Turkey, whose foreign debts in 1990 were less than $13.6 
billion, is now facing debts of $70 billion. Turkish Prime 
Minister Ciller admits the blockade has caused her country 
losses of more than $20 billion and has greatly affected its 
commercial dealings and economic situation. She calls for the 
need to end this blockade due to its disastrous results on her 
country. The Bulgarian Government has also demanded through its 
Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Matinchev the need to lift the 
blockade on Iraq, which has caused damages to Bulgaria amounting 
to $3.5 billion. The Bulgarian deputy prime minister admits all 
attempts to resolve this problem have failed since the countries 
imposing this blockade "no longer dig into their pockets to 
compensate those who suffered damages." 
  The increasing world outcry against the unfair blockade has 
established a tangible reality that accurately reflects the 
degree of its disintegration and erosion and the demand for its 
termination and burial. In as much as it showed the grave sin 
committed against Iraq and its people, the blockade revealed the 
great damage it has caused the world, and therefore fully 
exposed the logic of domination and the policy of monopolization 
being exercised by Washington. 
  Thus, the mounting outcry to lift the unfair blockade 
against 
our country has convinced us of our sound policy, strong will 
power, cohesiveness, and spirit of patience, endurance, and 
firmness. Were it not for this legendary steadfastness, we 
would not have been able to defeat the logic of aggression and 
to expose the faces of the aggressors with all their ugliness. 
  Indeed, it is now only a question of time, and all 
indications are time is in favor of steadfast Iraq.

  [Text] New York, 11 May (INA) -- Iraq has informed the UN 
General Secretariat that U.S. and other warplanes, flying from 
the Saudi and Kuwaiti territories, have violated Iraqi airspace 
over various Iraqi governorates and dropped leaflets hostile to 
Iraq and the Iraqi people. 
  In a message received by UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali today, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf 
said two enemy warplanes, flying from Saudi and Kuwait 
territories, violated Iraqi airspace on 3 May. They overflew 
al-Najaf and al-Muthanna Governorates and dropped large 
quantities of provocative leaflets, the message says. 
  The message adds U.S. and other warplanes carried out 
similar 
aggressive acts over the Ninawa, Salah al-Din, and al-Ta'mim 
Governorates. 
  The foreign minister stressed that the imposition of the 
no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq is an illegitimate 
and illegal act which has nothing to do with the United Nations. 
  Addressing the UN secretary general, the minister said: Your 
excellency, you have stressed this point more than once, and so 
did your spokesman, Mr. Gosles [name as transliterated]. The 
entire world knows that these illegitimate and illegal acts 
constitute a glaring aggression against Iraq and a serious 
violation of its sovereignty, security, and the safety of its 
people. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said Iraq strongly protests and 
denounces these provocative practices which contravene the rules 
of international law and the UN Charter. 
  He added: On behalf of the Iraqi Government, I officially 
ask you to assume your responsibilities toward halting those 
provocative practices and putting an end to the embargo imposed 
on Iraq in observance of the UN Charter and in accordance with 
the international body's responsibilities toward respecting 
nations' sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Report by a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Excerpt] Amman--The nearly 800 Palestinian policemen 
camped near the King Husayn Bridge will begin their entry to the 
occupied West Bank town of Jericho on Thursday [12 May], four 
days after the first units arrived there, Palestine Liberation 
Organnisation (PLO) officials said Wednesday. 
  They said negotiations between PLO and Israeli officials in 
the occupied territories as well as contacts between the Israeli 
government and the PLO leadership in Tunis had led to an 
understanding that the deployment could begin Thursday. 
  One of the key preconditions, according to reports from 
occupied Jerusalem and Tunis, is that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
announce his autonomy cabinet which will run the occupied Gaza 
Strip and Jericho in the initial phase of the Sept. 13 
Israel-PLO agreement signed in Washington. 
  As the first concrete step towards the deployment, several 
senior officials from the police force, drawn from units of the 
Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) based in Jordan and Iraq, 
entered Jericho on Wednesday to inspect areas designated for the 
police force to take up positions, the PLO officials said. They 
returned to the East Bank later in the day. 
  "We expect the deployment to begin in earnest on Friday," 
said a PLO official. "An advance unit of a few officers and men 
will enter on Thursday, but the actual entry will formally begin 
24 hours later." 
  Brigadier Haj Isma'il Jabr, commander-designate of Jericho, 
said "a platoon of my forces will be allowed into Jericho at an 
early hour Thursday morning." A platoon consists of 50 men. 
  "A second batch of approximately 300 men will be allowed 
into 
Jericho Thursday afternoon to be followed by nearly 400 men on 
Friday," Brig. Jabr told the Associated Press. 
  Brig. Isma'il blamed the four-day delay in the entry into 
Jericho on technical problems--primarily that some of the men 
did not possess travel documents. 
  "The main problem was because some of the policemen do not 
have any travel documents, such as passports or identification 
cards," he said. 
  He refused to disclose their number or how the problem was 
solved. 
  But a security source,quoted by the AP, estimated the number 
at 100 and said the Kingdom had agreed to provide them with 
Jordanian passports. 
  Highly-placed PLO sources described the delay as a tactic by 
the Israelis. "They want to tell us that nothing has changed by 
the peace agreement and they are still in control," said one 
source. 
  "Keeping the force camped out near the bridge under 
international media limelight is their way of telling us that 
they still call the shots," said the source. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Rafah, 11 May (MENA)--A second group of 150 members 
of the Palestinian National Security Forces entered the Gaza 
Strip via the Rafah crossing point today. 
  Colonel Fawzi Zaqzuq, commander of the contingent, said it 
is 
part of the Palestinian 'Ayn Jalut Forces, which was stationed 
in Egypt. In addition to enlisted men, it includes several 
officers of various ranks and some noncommissioned officers. 
  He said today's contingent complements the group that 
entered 
yesterday. He explained that their weapons and equipment 
arrived in Gaza earlier. 
  Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad 
'Abd-al-Wahhab, 
commander of the 'Ayn Jalut Forces, said that the weapons on 
hand are sufficient for sentry purposes and to maintain order in 
the Palestinian streets. He said that the first groups to 
arrive will assume their positions and carry out a temporary 
deployment until the remaining forces arrive and take over 
overall authority for security in the area. 
  Brig. Gen. 'Abd-al-Wahhab said that the Palestinian forces 
are ready to begin their duties in the autonomy areas, pointing 
out that 2,000 policemen are ready to enter immediately if 
Israel agrees. 
  He noted that all the Palestinian people are waiting for the 
arrival of their national forces and will welcome their presence 
regardless of any political differences among various factions. 
  Brig. Gen. 'Abd-al-Wahhab remarked, however, that the 
technical capabilities and equipment of the Palestinian police 
are still very poor because no grants or aid have been received 
yet from the countries that announced plans to send aid. He 
said the United States has sent 200 vehicles as a gift, but they 
are not equipped as police cars.

  [Text] Gaza -- Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq, a member of Fatah's 
supreme authority, has stressed that the Palestinian police 
force will collect weapons in accordance with a national 
agreement between all Palestinian factions and forces. 
  Widespread chaos in the security realm has been witnessed in 
recent days. The possession of weapons and their use against 
people, with or without reason, have become a phenomenon of 
concern to the Palestinian residents in the Gaza Strip. Last 
week's shootings led to the death of more than six residents, 
including children. 
  'Abd-al-Raziq emphasized that for some time now, the 
Palestinian national forces have been conducting a national 
dialogue on the issue of disarming all forces. 
  'Abd-al-Raziq added: We are facing a great challenge and a 
greater test. As Palestinians, we can flourish and succeed. 
The national interest will govern relations on this and other 
issues.

  [Text] Rafah, 11 May (MENA)--Major General Nasr Yusuf, 
director general of the Palestinian National Security Forces, 
has announced that the first group of these forces entered the 
Gaza Strip yesterday via the Egyptian border crossing point at 
Rafah. He added that 7,000 Palestinian policemen will enter 
Gaza over the next three weeks, including the 'Ayn Jalut Forces 
from Egypt, the forces now in Yemen who will travel via Saudi 
Arabia, and later the forces currently stationed in Libya and 
Sudan. 
  He explained that at the same time the Badr Forces, 
currently 
in Jordan, and al-Aqsa Forces, currently in Iraq, will enter the 
West Bank via the Allenby Bridge, where they will join 2,000 
policemen already residing in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The director general of the Palestinian National Security 
Forces affirmed that there is a sufficient number of policemen 
involved to deploy them in the autonomy area and maintain 
security there. He noted, however, that the Palestinian police 
apparatus needs international assistance to cover the cost of 
equipment. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf said that the role of these policemen is to 
maintain peace and order, guarantee democratic freedoms, and 
protect people of all political affiliations, taking into 
account the need to use methods of persuasion, discussion, 
dialogue, and democracy. 
  Marwan Kanafani, official spokesman for Palestinian 
President 
Yasir 'Arafat, announced that several Palestinian, Israeli, 
Egyptian, and Jordanian joint committees are discussing the 
return of the Palestinians who left their homes after the 1967 
war, as outlined in the Oslo Agreement. 
  Kanafani urged that all Palestinian detainees, regardless of 
their political affiliations or whether they support or oppose 
the autonomy agreement, be released. He called for the 
repatriation of all Palestinian deportees. 
  He pointed out that a Palestinian passport will be issued to 
every citizen to be used when entering of leaving the country. 
  Kanafani explained that the delay in the entry of some 
Palestinian police forces was caused by the Yemeni civil war, 
the air blockade of Libya, and several procedural problems 
connected with the size of the forces, their equipment and 
weapons, and the need to sort out all political, military, 
financial, and administrative arrangements pertaining to the 
deployment of these forces. He said many of these problems had 
been solved with the help of the Egyptian brothers. He urged 
all Arab countries to facilitate transportation for these forces. 
  He added that the families of the Palestinian policemen will 
enter the self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho in several stages 
after this issue is discussed with the Israeli authorities and 
after amenities such as housing and schools are provided for 
them.

  [Text] Cairo, May 11 (AFP)--PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat has 
nominated five leading figures from the occupied territories to 
the 25-member Palestinian Authority due to take over in Gaza and 
Jericho, the PLO's chief autonomy negotiator said here Wednesday 
[11 May]. 
  Nabil Sha'th named the five as: 

  -  Zakariya al-Agha, a doctor and head of 'Arafat's 
mainstream Fatah faction in the occupied Gaza Strip, 
  -  Furayh Abu-Middayn, president of the Gaza Bar Association 
and a 
member of the Palestinian delegation to the autonomy talks with 
Israel, 
  -  Riyad al-Za'nun, a doctor and head of the higher health 
council 
in the Gaza Strip, 
  -  Ilyas Furayj, mayor of Bethlehem in the West Bank, 
  -  'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad, a Palestinian deportee who 
returned to the occupied territories. 

    Earlier a source at PLO headquarters in Tunis said Zakariya 
al-Agha would be put in charge of Gaza and autonomy negotiator 
Jamil al-Tarifi would take charge of Jericho. 
  In Cairo, Palestinian officials said Sha'th had also been 
nominated to the authority, but Sha'th refused to comment when 
asked to confirm the report. 
  Yasir 'Amr, a member of the PLO executive committee, said 
Tuesday the Palestinian Authority would consist of 15 figures 
from the occupied territories and 10 from the Palestinian 
diaspora. 
  'Arafat, who is due to head the authority, will resume 
discussions on its composition once he returns from South 
Africa, where he attended the swearing-in of President Nelson 
Mandela. 
  The PLO has accused Israel of linking the deployment of 
Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho to the formation of 
the team. 
  "I'm awaiting from the other side honest implementation of 
what has been agreed upon. It is not the case," 'Arafat told 
Israeli television from South Africa.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hamas Official Tells AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: We Are Committed to a Strategy of Jihad Action; the 
Command in the Occupied Territory Determines Its Circumstances"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Hamas has reaffirmed 
its full and irrevocable commitment to its strategy of jihad 
action. A senior Hamas official has stated that the movement's 
military command in the occupied territories decides and 
determines the method, time, and place of such action. 
  In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday, the 
official said that "Hamas is determined more than ever before to 
continue the jihad and not to recognize the state of the Zionist 
entity, awaiting the success of Arab and Islamic awakening." 
  The official, who wished to remain anonymous, disclosed the 
results of the recent meetings in Damascus of the Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces [APF] opposed to the peace process. He said 
that "the main issue discussed by the conferees in Damascus was 
the question of drawing a suitable mechanism for aborting the 
Cairo agreement by nonviolent means, particularly as the circle 
of Palestinian opposition forces is now larger because many have 
abandoned the Madrid conference dreams which were translated 
into bitter facts in the Cairo agreement." 
  He said that "the Palestinian people's conviction that what 
was on offer was insignificant will be reinforced when they see 
the bitter facts on the ground when the Cairo agreement is 
implemented and when they discover that it is no more than a 
federation with the Zionist entity as confirmed in the 400 pages 
of the agreement in their political, security, economic, and 
civilian aspects." 
  He also said: Hamas representative 'Imad al-'Alami briefed 
the APF representatives on the latest developments, especially 
the Zionist and U.S. pressures to which the movement was 
subjected in some areas and also the dimensions and essence of 
the agreement reached between the Fatah Hawks and al-Qassam 
Battalions in Gaza. He explained that it was no more than a 
field agreement which did not rise to the level of political 
agreement because Hamas' declared position on the agreement is 
still the same. 
  The official also said that Hamas made a point of 
"explaining 
to the Palestinian opposition groups the circumstances of the 
political initiative announced by Hamas Political Bureau 
Chairman Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, which attracted media attention in 
recent weeks. It said that Hamas is committed to its strategy 
of insisting on every inch of Palestinian territory, and that it 
is committed in principle, politically, and nationally not to 
negotiate with, have peace with, or recognize Israel...and that 
Hamas' initiative was a mechanism presented to public opinion 
because Hamas does not operate in a vacuum and has a phased 
concept linked to its strategic concept. He stressed that Hamas 
is for the liberation of all Palestine but "we did not say that 
that would be achieved in one go because that would be a 
prevarication, realistically and historically."

<F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>
  [Text] The Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] Central 
Command has held a meeting in the presence of the 
representatives of this alliance in Lebanon. The discussion 
dealt with the serious repercussions the Cairo agreement will 
have on the Palestinians in the diaspora. 
  A statement issued by the conferees emphasized that this 
agreement endangers the status of the diaspora Palestinians, 
particularly in the camps in Lebanon. In this respect, the 
secretaries general of the 10 Palestinian factions called on the 
Lebanese Government and the Lebanese nationalist and Islamic 
forces to enhance the cohesion and the unity of blood enshrined 
by the Lebanese and Palestinian people, and to defend the 
Palestinian people's right to repatriation. In their message to 
the Lebanese Government, the factions reiterated their rejection 
of resettlement in Lebanon. The 10 factions said they hope the 
Lebanese Government will help the Palestinian people in Lebanon 
solve the problems they face, treat Palestinians as equals with 
the Lebanese concerning job opportunities, and reconstruct the 
camps after the United Nations Relief and Works Agency [UNRWA] 
reduced its aid to these camps. The factions called on UNRWA to 
continue its task of providing various services to the 
Palestinian people. 
  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] 
sources said other meetings will be held in Lebanon between the 
10 factions, the Lebanese Government, and UNRWA representatives 
to tackle these issues.

  [Text] In a statement to Channel 3 of Algiers radio, Prime 
Minister Mokdad Sifi answered a number of questions on various 
topics such as the national economic and social council, which 
he described as a step forward. The prime minister stated that 
the National Transitional Council will be installed soon and 
that sufficient time has been given to all parties to consider 
the issue of participating in the council. 
  Regarding the priorities of his government's agenda, Mr. 
Sifi 
stressed three points: economic stimulation, the strengthening 
of the state's institutions, and national solidarity. 
  In his reply to a question on the possibility of calling 
early elections before the end of the transitional period, the 
prime minister said that the matter depends mainly on the 
existence of stable conditions. 
  On the agreement with the IMF, which he preferred to call 
the 
Algerian restructuring program, which was accepted by the IMF, 
the prime minister said that it has positive and negative 
effects and that we should wait for the talks with the Paris 
Club and the duration of the debt rescheduling period. He added 
that there is a plan to help low-income social classes. 
  Regarding Algeria's educational system, the prime minister 
expressed hope that it would be changed from within the regime 
itself with the participation of the administration, staff, and 
parents. 
  In conclusion, the prime minister said that he prefers a 
policy of consultation with the administration and all parties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algeria: Ben Bella Completes His </F>
Mediation Between Authorities and Salvation Front in Washington"] 
  [Excerpt] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Reliable sources in Algiers 
have said that former President Ahmed Ben Bella, leader of the 
Movement for Democracy, has been in Washington for a week and 
that he met with senators and Western and Algerian figures close 
to the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. En route to the United 
States, Ben Bella stopped over in London, where he met with Arab 
and foreign figures who encouraged him to mediate between the 
FIS and the authorities. 
  Well-informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that the former 
president's "secret mission" is represented in continuing 
contacts with some FIS leaders, which began in Algeria three 
weeks ago on orders from President Liamine Zeroual. [passage

  [Text] Cairo, May 12 (MENA)--"AL-AHRAM" warned, in its 
editorial today, against playing with fire in Yemen. 
  South Yemen said Arab elements are fighting alongside north 
Yemenis, adding that these elements will appear on Aden 
television screens, the paper said. 
  This version has several serious implications. 
  According to this version, troops from an Arab country may 
be 
fighting beside the forces of the north along with Arab elements 
living in Yemen. 
  The report may, in the meantime, be a call for 
internationalizing the crisis, the paper added. 
  In any case there should be a warning against any 
interference in the Yemeni war in the way reported by the 
southerners, the paper said.

  [Text] CAIRO, May 11 (AFP)--Egyptian authorities are 
holding between 20,000 and 30,000 political prisoners, most of 
them Moslem fundamentalists, the Egyptian Human Rights 
Organisation said Wednesday. 
  Mahmud Qandil, a member of the organisation's board, said it 
was difficult to have a precise figure because "every day many 
detainees are arrested or released." The Interior Ministry 
could not give an exact number, he said, but added that 
"according to various estimates, the number of political 
prisoners was between 20,000 and 30,000." 
  Qandil was presenting a report by a team from the 
organisation which visited Asyut, the southern region which has 
seen the worst violence between fundamentalists and the security 
forces. According to the report nearly two-thirds of the 114 
people killed in the violence in the first four months of this 
year died in Asyut province. It blamed the outlawed al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) for the murder of a German woman 
tourist and 29 policemen in the region this year and also said 
the al-Jama'ah was suspected of killing eight Coptic Christians, 
including five gunned down in a monastery in March. 
  However, the organisation also accused the security forces 
of 
rounding up daily at least 250 people "indiscriminately" on 
suspicion of belonging to the al-Jama'ah. 
  Witnesses quoted in the report said the "excessive or 
accidental" use of firearms by the police had led to the deaths 
of innocent people, such as the killing of four people on March 
27 who had no connections with the outlawed fundamentalists. 
The government has launched frequent raids on hideouts used by 
the Islamic militants, whose two-year violent campaign has badly 
hit the tourist industry and cost almost 400 lives. 
  The human rights organisation said the situation was likely 
to "explode" in the Suhaj and al-Minyah provinces to the north 
and south of Asyut. It urged the authorities to set up an 
independent legal commission to investigate killings by the 
security forces in their battle against the militants. 
  The report said the violence would only stop when the 
government respected the law, ensured freedom of speech, changed 
the education system and stopped certain broadcasts likely to 
incite sectarian violence. 
  On Tuesday a senior Egyptian opposition MP, Kamil Khalid, 
accused unnamed government officials of ordering the killing of 
a lawyer closely associated with the militants. Khalid said 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani died after having tried to give him 
proposals for ending the conflict between the militants and the 
security forces. 
  The Egyptian Bar Association earlier accused the security 
forces of torturing Madani to death in custody.

  [Excerpt] Khartoum, 11 May (KNA/PANA) -- Alarmed over the 
fate of tens of thousands of its nationals working in embattled 
Yemen, the Sudanese Government has decided to evacuate those of 
them who wish to return home. 
  The Commission for the Affairs of Sudanese Working Abroad, 
Wednesday [11 May] urged the Sudanese living in Yemen who might 
wish to be evacuated, to proceed to a Sudanese vessel now 
anchored at the north Yemeni al-Hudaydah port on the Red Sea. 
The commission said in a statement issued in Khartoum that the 
national airline, Sudanair, would arrange a flight to the north 
Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on 14 May to evacuate Sudanese. It urged 
those wishing to take the flight back home to register their 
names at the Embassy of Sudan in Sanaa. 
  No arrangements were announced for the evacuation of 
Sudanese 
from Aden, capital of south Yemen. The commission said it had 
set up a task force comprising concerned government bodies and 
opened an operations room to accomplish the job. 
  Tens of thousands of Sudanese nationals were employed in the 
two Yemens as doctors, teachers, workers and journalists, among 
other professions. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The state minister at the Foreign Ministry, 
Archbishop Gabriel Rodge, announced that the Sudanese Embassy in 
South Africa will be opened next month. Addressing the regular

recent tour of southern African states as successful and that 
the tour realized its objectives of affirming Sudan's firm 
attitude towards attainment of a peaceful settlement to the 
southern Sudan question. He said that [word indistinct] Namibian 
president pledged to President 'Umar al-Bashir, on the sidelines 
of the celebrations for the swearing-in of Nelson Mandela, to 
review (?and) strengthen relations between Sudan and Namibia.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Addressing the Knesset plenum 
today, Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu announced: The day on 
which the agreement with the PLO was signed was a dark day. 
This document is a disaster, a historical mistake. 
  [Begin Netanyahu recording] Furtively, surreptitiously, 
perfidiously, they are trying to divert the public's attention 
from the signed-and-sealed next stage: Samaria and Judaea, the 
Jordan Rift Valley and the eastern slopes of the Judaea 
Mountains, as well as Jerusalem, whose turn to be united with 
the PLO will come during this obsequious government's course of 
action. 
  In Oslo, you envisioned the first stage of the Arab state 
from the sea to the desert. In Washington, you signed an 
agreement to love and cherish 'Arafat, the chairman of the 
murder syndicate. And in Cairo, publicly degraded and 
humiliated in a live broadcast aired to the entire world, you 
signed the document of surrender. [end recording] 
  Rabin stared tiredly at Netanyahu, then waved his hand 
dismissively and slowly uttered: Baloney. [passage omitted]

  [Text] All opposition Knesset members [MK's] left the 
plenum prior to the vote held in conclusion of the debate at 
which Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin presented the Gaza and 
Jericho agreements. In the opposition's absence, the prime 
minister's speech was endorsed by a majority of 52 versus zero 
opponents. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht notes that some 
opposition MK's, including Dan Meridor, Beni Begin, Yitzhaq 
Shamir, and David Levi, were sharply opposed to abandoning the 
plenum. They maintained that the step is a violation of 
parliamentary rules. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who closed the debate, said 
that in the Likud era, 120,000 Palestinians were locked up in 
prisons, which were schools for nationalism and the reason for 
the emergence of a Palestinian nation and a Palestinian entity 
in Gaza.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's </F>
ambassador to the United States and chief delegate to the talks 
with Syria, by Washington correspondent Arye Golan on 11 May; 
place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Golan] Sir, we hear that the State Department has 
very low expectations about Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's upcoming trip to the Middle East and it does not 
expect an imminent breakthrough. Do you share this cautious 
pessimism? 
  [Rabinovich] I would not necessarily use the pessimistic 
language used here, in Washington, on the eve of the visit. 
Lowering expectations in advance of trips by senior U.S. 
statesmen to enable them to deal with the issues on the agenda 
free of pressure for immediate achievements is a known pattern. 
  [Golan] Did Secretary of State Christopher voice any 
reservations whatsoever about the Israeli package? In the 
meetings you held with him and his peace team this week, did you 
equip him with different or new ideas to present in Damascus? 
  [Rabinovich] The U.S. side had no reservations about the 
Israeli package, I do not know what such reports are based on. 
  [Golan] Did he approve of the Israeli package? 
  [Rabinovich] No new ideas were required in the wake of our 
discussions with the Americans this week. We presented our 
so-called package to the secretary of state in his previous 
visit. He relayed his impressions [as heard] to the Syrian side 
and came back with reactions and counterproposals. We clearly 
do not plan to go into any bargaining at this point. First of 
all, we want to make sure that the Syrians fully realize that we 
are talking about a comprehensive package in which every element 
is part of a whole complex and that a specific issue cannot be 
singled out. This is the package, and its principles are 
nonnegotiable.

  [Excerpts] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is to withdraw 
completely from Jericho tomorrow, and more Palestinian police 
are moving into the Gaza Strip. Details from Tzvi Pantanowitz: 
  The pace is quickening. Last night hundreds of Palestinian 
police were poised to move into the Gaza Strip and the Jericho 
enclave, which are to form the start of autonomy for the 
Palestinians in the territories. 
  In Jericho, the advanced guard of the Palestinian police 
units -- about 20 security men -- will arrive to check control 
points and to study the routes of joint patrols with Israeli 
border policemen today. Another 40 Palestinian security 
personnel are due tomorrow. They are to take over the Jericho 
police station, the ancient Jewish synagogue, and a military 
base. And, in a more than symbolic gesture, the Israel Civil 
Administration will hand over to the Palestinians the keys to 
their offices. 
  IDF forces will then begin pulling back, and by the 
afternoon 
it is expected that the entire enclave will come under 
Palestinian control. Once this is settled, the force of some 
350 policemen poised on the Jordanian side of the Allenby Bridge 
will arrive to assume their duties. [passage omitted] 
  Due to cross the Allenby Bridge tonight are another 350 
policemen and security personnel. They will be transported by 
bus and trucks to the Gaza Strip via Israel. 
  In Gaza, the takeover is beginning to pick up, working from 
the south northwards. The celebrations in Dayr al-Balah town 
and the adjacent refugee camp have not abated. And, there was 
some tension again last night. The long lines of policemen 
moving northwards from the Rafah border terminal at one stage 
blocked access to Israeli settlers trying to reach their homes 
in the Qatif area. Angry and frustrated by the long delays, some 
of them set out on foot to their homes after the Army decided to 
close the road to prevent friction between the two groups. 
  The IDF is reported to be satisfied with the pace of 
withdrawal from facilities in Gaza and Jericho, and says from 
its point of view the pullout will be completed by next week. 
In any event, the Israeli Government believes the hand-over can 
proceed in an accelerated fashion over the next few days, and by 
Friday next week -- as Cabinet Minister Yosi Sarid said 
yesterday -- the Gaza Strip, except for the Jewish settlements, 
and the Jericho enclave will be in Palestinian hands and a new 
phase on the road to autonomy will begin. 
  [A report by Eytan Rabin and 'Amira Hess on page A5 of Tel 
Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 12 May quotes a senior IDF source as 
saying yesterday that "according to our estimates, many weeks 
will pass before the Palestinian policemen are able to operate 
in the Gaza Strip. We fear it will not be able to take control 
of the area or operate against wanted men. We may have to 
continue operating in the area, leaving behind troops to perform 
their missions." 
  [The IDF source "expressed concern about the lack of 
professionalism of the Palestinian policemen" and possible 
"internal killings in the Gaza Strip" due to the disputes and 
disagreements within the local leadership. The source went on 
to say that "there is uncertainty about the performance of the 
Palestinian police in the joint patrols with the Israeli Border 
Police" scheduled to start within a few days.]

  [Text] Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir has ruled that 
after the transfer of powers to the Palestinian authority in 
Gaza and Jericho, Knesset members [MK] will no longer enjoy 
parliamentary immunity and special privileges in those areas. 
In all other areas of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza MK's enjoy 
special privileges stemming from their position, and the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] authorities must respect them. 
  Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports the attorney general 
emphasized that in the event of a clash between security needs 
in the area and the right of an MK to freedom of movement, the 
security needs will prevail. Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir was addressing 
the Knesset House Committee.

<F P=106> [Statement by Hizballah on the Palestinian-Israeli agreement </F>
signed in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] A new festival of fraudulence is being held in an 
Arab capital to obliterate the most luminous cause, the 
Palestinian cause. 
  The so-called self-rule agreement signed by 'Arafat, Rabin, 
the U.S. secretary of state, and the Russian foreign minister is 
aimed at giving complete legitimacy to the Zionist occupation of 
the occupied territories in return for giving the Palestinians 
some powers to administer their affairs. 
  This agreement seeks to make the treacherous and rejected 
occupation a legitimate authority acceptable to the Palestinian 
people. Therefore, this festival is one of fraudulence attended 
by several foreign and Arab false witnesses. 
  It is a crime committed against the land, man, and history. 
They want us to believe this is the long-awaited peace. We 
ask: Where is the sovereignty? Where are the rest of the 
rights? What is the fate of the detainees? What is the fate of 
the rest of the occupied territories? What is the fate of the 
millions in the diaspora? What is the fate of Jerusalem? What 
is the fate of all Palestine? Where is all this in the agreement? 
  Nothing, nothing. There is nothing now or even in the 
future, because 'Arafat has accepted the bare minimum to enable 
the Palestinian people to establish a state on even a part of 
their land in the future. It is a new treason with widespread 
Arab blessing. The fraudulence in Cairo was preceded by two 
ceremonies in Muscat and Doha celebrating peace and cooperation 
with the enemy. 
  We urge the sons of the Palestinian people and the sons of 
our nation to realize the dangers of this new plot and to use 
all means to undermine the prospects of the plotters and foil 
their schemes by rejecting all projects presented under the 
banner of a promised peace and future for the Palestinian people 
and the region's nations. These represent the worst link in the 
chain of moves to destroy and seize the region. 
  This new plot will not pass, regardless of its potentials 
and 
supporters and regardless of the extolling headlines. Our 
nation will be lying in wait and will not allow some ostracized 
people to exploit our nation in order to serve their interests 
and threaten our nation's interests. 
  Certainly, it is a day of mourning and grief for the 
Palestinian people and the sons of the Arab and Islamic nation 
to see that the Palestinian people have become an isolated 
community in a state where the authority of the Jewish usurpers 
is being legitimized.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Shaykh Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah </F>
by unidentified ETTELA'AT correspondent; date and place not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [ETTELA'AT] One of the most 
important issues in Lebanon and the Middle East is that of the 
peace talks with the Zionist regime. How do you view the future 
of these talks? What is Lebanon's role in these talks? 
  [Fadlallah] In my opinion, in Lebanon the dimensions of the 
peace talks are far greater than in other countries because we 
have factions that differ on the peace talks. There is a group 
that accepts the concept of absolute peace and another group 
rejects it in toto. Another group wishes to accept it 
conditionally while yet another group wants to reject it if 
there are any conditions. Thus, I believe that in Lebanon, any 
cultural or political move on peace or other issues has far 
greater consequences than in other countires. 
  As for the future of peace, the talks lack an element of 
greatness and effectiveness which could culminate in some 
definite outcome in the future. This is because the problems 
between the Arabs and the Zionist regime have some difficult 
conflicts that cannot be resolved in a year. 
  In any case, I do feel that the talks are moving toward 
peace. This is because the regional and international 
situations--with all they entail--exert pressure on all sides to 
sign the peace accord. Of course, this pressure is directed more 
toward the Arabs than Israel. The present political and 
security situation in the region has endangered the interests of 
the big governments, the United States in particular. [passage 
omitted] 
  If the Arab and Islamic worlds were to wake up from their 
prolonged slumber, it is possible that they could foil the U.S. 
and Zionist plans, but the problem is that we do not see any 
basic political revolution. What we see here is only political 
talk or political plans. In fact, those who reject the peace 
process do not have any definite or formulated program on how to 
handle the various stages of the peace plan. Therefore what we 
see are mere airy notions, slogans, plans and stances, most of 
which have no relation to other stances and programs. 
  Thus, when we look at international realities and the 
current 
weakness in the Arab and Islamic world, as well as those who are 
opposed to the talks, we conclude that in the course of one or 
two years the talks will fall into the groove that was 
envisioned for them. Many people believe that if the peace 
talks do not yield any results by the end of 1994, they will be 
postponed to after the U.S. elections, as the Americans usually 
begin preparing for the next presidential elections two years 
after a new president takes office. Meanwhile, the American Jews 
will be able to take advantage of this opportunity to put the 
necessary pressure on the talks, which will then halt these 
talks. It is to the Zionists' advantage to keep the talks like 
this and not to let them make any headway, but at the same time 
they want to get whatever they want from the talks. 
  Lebanon does not have a fundamental role in these talks, as 
it usually keeps in step with Syria with regard to relations 
with the Zionist regime and on the subject of peace talks. It 
is no secret that Lebanon's position is closely linked with the 
Syrian stance. It is natural that this would prevent Lebanon 
from falling into internal or external schemes for a separate 
peace with the Zionist regime. This relationship between 
Lebanon and Syria--even though it is considered to have some 
weak points--has some positive aspects too. 
  [ETTELA'AT] How do you assess the latest events in Lebanon, 
the revelation of those responsible for the bombing of Sayyidat 
al- Najat Church, and the Lebanese Government's clash with the 
Lebanese Forces led by Samir Ja'ja'? Is it expected that the 
Lebanese Government will step up its confrontation with other 
groups in Lebanon? 
  [Fadlallah] It is natural that there should be a U.S. plan 
for Lebanon, namely, that the army take over the security bases 
in Lebanon. This would enable it to exert political pressure. 
The United States is seeking to do this with all its might. The 
United States has chosen the Lebanese Army as a means to this 
end. 
  It is not too farfetched to believe that on the domestic 
level, there has been some sort of agreement with Syria. But 
the Army's complete control or deployment is not as negative for 
Lebanon as chaos and disarray would be harmful to it. But many 
politicians believe that this Lebanese fear of chaos and 
disarray may be misused to impose new restrictions in Lebanon, 
which would not be in the interest of public freedom. We do see 
such stances, which are opposed to freedom, in Lebanon. 
  In the newspapers, in the general political atmosphere, and 
in some of the government sources in Lebanon, there is talk of 
pressure on some groups, especially Hizballah. This is because 
Hizballah is considered the representative of the opposition 
forces, considered to be under Iran's support and orders. It is 
the only armed group that still has its weapons, because its 
weapons are used in the resistance of the occupation of south 
Lebanon. This has prevented pressure from being exerted on it 
by the Lebanese Government. 
  In the circumstances, the Lebanese Government will not 
permit 
the suppression of Hizballah or of the Islamic Resistance. This 
is because the Islamic Resistance Movement has lawful local, 
regional, and international reasons for existing and the 
governments are forced to accept them. The Islamic Resistance 
Movement is a popular movement that demands the withdrawal of 
foreigners from these territories. 
  From this angle, the Lebanese Government, an ally of the 
Syrian Government, cannot resort to crushing the Resistance, 
because Syria would not agree. Any confrontation of the 
Resistance by the Lebanese Government would also generate 
problems, which could usher in a return to civil war in Lebanon. 
Despite this and without resorting to tackling the issue of the 
Islamic Resistance directly, the Lebanese Government will take 
measures to implement some plans that would place Hizballah in a 
position of weakness. 
  [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the role of the Islamic 
Resistance in the south? 
  [Fadlallah] In my view, the Islamic Resistance Movement 
enjoys freedom of action politically and militarily. But it may 
encounter major difficulties if the talks achieve results and 
peace with the Zionist regime. Then the conditions in the Arab 
world will exert pressure on the Islamic Resistance. There 
could be efforts to embroil the Islamic Resistance in 
differences and internal dissent, just as we witnessed clashes 
in the past between the Hizballah and Amal movements. The 
Resistance will face greater hardships and problems but this 
does not mean it will succumb to them. The Islamic Resistance 
may have other choices in the resistance of the Zionist regime 
and these may be different from those they have now. 
  [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the effect of the Gaza-Jericho 
Accord and a regional economic accord between the Arab countries 
and the Zionist regime on Iran, from the security and economic 
point of view? 
  [Fadlallah] The Zionist regime is using the Gaza-Jericho 
Accord as a gateway to the Arab world through the Palestinians. 
The Zionist regime is using the Palestinians as a bridge to 
link it with the Arab world by signing economic agreements. 
This is why we see the Zionists giving greater importance to 
talks on economic issues with the Palestinians, as their 
objective is to gain economic influence in the Arab world and 
the Middle East. 
  The U.S. role in this regard is to abolish the concept of 
the "Arab world" so that it can create a strategic, political, 
and economic region in the Middle East within an international 
order which conforms to U.S. interests. It is for this reason 
that the United States speaks of the Middle East and not of the 
Arab world, and is considering using Turkey as a strong factor 
in security, political, and economic transactions in the region. 
  I imagine that the future position of the Islamic Republic 
of 
Iran will be difficult as the United States is proposing to 
embargo it unless it accepts U.S. conditions. In the U.S. 
scheme of things, a toppling of the Islamic system is not 
necessary, as long as it conforms to U.S. plans in the region 
and retreats where U.S. policies are concerned. This is 
something that Iran has not accepted so far. 
  Therefore, the current economic situation will exert greater 
pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran as economic relations 
increase. This will also be true from a security point of view. 
Iran should be especially prepared, as this plan has some 
dangerous elements. We have complete faith that the leadership 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khamene'i, and 
President Hashemi- Rafsanjani, will follow these developments 
through the Supreme National Security Council or other bodies. 
It is also the obligation of the Muslim Iranian people to ward 
off these new plots -- that is the economic, security, and 
political embargo by the United States -- and they should remain 
steadfastly their leadership. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beirut, May 11 (AFP)--Lebanon's central bank has 
sold 115 million dollars from its reserves since Monday to 
bolster the Lebanese pound, which came under pressure after 
Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri decided to boycott the government. 
  Bankers and government officials said the central bank, 
which 
has reserves of around 2.7 billion dollars, wanted to maintain 
the current exchange rate of 1,689.50 pounds to the dollar. 
  The last such intervention occurred last August, amid 
speculation triggered by a major Israeli military offensive in 
southern Lebanon. 
  Al-Hariri, a Sunni Moslem, decided Sunday to boycott 
government meetings after plans for a reshuffle aimed at 
including more Christian figures were opposed by President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi, himself a Christian, and the parliament speaker Nabih 
Birri, a Shiite Moslem. 
  Al-Hariri ordered the postponement of the weekly cabinet 
session. 
  The billionaire prime minister's appointment in October 1992 
and his plans to rebuild war-shattered Lebanon at a cost of up 
to 12 billion dollars helped to attract back Western and Arab 
investors to Lebanon. 
  But his 30-member Syrian-backed government, made up equally 
of Christian and Moslem ministers, has failed to enjoy the trust 
of many Lebanese political and religious leaders, namely the 
Christians. 
  The situation has been exacerbated with the recent arrests 
of 
dozens of former Christian militiamen, including former warlord 
Samir Ja'ja', in connection with a February church bombing and a 
1991 political killing.

<F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn to units of the Palestinian National </F>
Security Forces during an inspection visit in Ghawr Nimrin on 11 
May -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Brother youths: In the name of Jordan and 
Jordanians, in the name of all the kinsfolk, I am pleased to 
meet with you at these moment while you are preparing to move to 
your fraternal, dear, and cherished homeland. On behalf of 
everyone, and in my name, I convey to you all love, 
appreciation, and pride. [applause] [crowd shouts: One people, 
not two peoples; long live King Husayn] 
  We hope you will convey to the kinsfolk and beloved ones in 
the West Bank and in the Gaza of Hashim all love, appreciation, 
and pride in their legendary and heroic steadfastness and in 
their adherence to both the land and right. We pray to God the 
almighty that these measures are the beginning of the path of 
regaining the national rights of the Palestinian Arab people on 
their national soil. 
  I hope that one thing is not absent from the mind of any of 
you, that is, I am here personally, and all your kinsfolk and 
brothers are from you and for you. We do not have any greed or 
ambition except to see our brothers and kinsfolk in Palestine 
free on their national soil, living a dignified life, which is 
their right. [crowd applauds, shouts: "Long live His Majesty 
King Husayn"] 
  In addition to this, we are for you to the best of our 
capabilities and resources. We are dealing with your 
leadership, the PLO leadership, the sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian Arab people [applause] in 
accordance with the will of both this people and the Arab nation 
shown in 1974. We will continue to proceed on this line. All 
of you live in our hearts and deep in our conscience. 
  We, here in Jordan, are for the one who will leave his 
kinsfolk to carry out his new tasks because his kinsfolk are 
ours and our beloved ones. You are also our kinsfolk, and 
Jordan, with everything in it, is your kinsfolk. [applause] 
[crowd shouts: Long live King Husayn; one people, not two 
peoples] 
  Concluding, we wish all of you success in their service and 
sacrifices. We also hope that you will be up to the level of 
the hopes of the kinsfolk whom you will meet in the West Bank, 
Gaza, and the remainder of the dear occupied Palestinian Arab 
territory. It is a great duty. However, with God's help and 
through everyone's resolve and awareness, you will perfectly 
carry out your duty. God the almighty is the one who grants 
success and sponsors the march. Greetings. [applause] [crowd 
shouts: Long live His Majesty King Husayn] 
  Be reassured that we here are one cohesive family. 
Consequently, we all are members of one family in terms of the 
past, present, and future, and also in confronting all 
circumstances and possibilities. If you please now, allow me to 
shake hands with you, one by one.

  [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 
'Atif Sidqi has urged the Jordanian Government to respond 
positively to the requirements of the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement, both the political part which was signed in Cairo, 
and the economic part which was recently signed in Paris. 
  Dr. Sidqi, who led the Egyptian side to the meetings of the 
Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee, has linked the 
reactivation of Egyptian-Jordanian economic cooperation with 
Jordan's response to the strategic U.S. policies, "which Egypt 
is concerned about implementing in the field of comprehensive 
development in the region," as Sidqi put it, and which Egypt 
cannot disregard. 
  He said that his visit to Amman reflects Egypt's concern 
about reactivating Jordan's role in the economic plan set for 
the region, which will begin in the occupied territories, in 
which Jordan is a key player, and which will eventually lead to 
the creation of a Middle East economic entity, and later a 
political entity.

  [Text] Amman--Well-informed Jordanian sources say that the 
Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister Sa'id al-Tall's recent visit to 
Baghdad dealt with the issue of Jordanian nationals being held 
in the Baghdad regime's jails. Official Jordanian circles 
estimate the number of these convicted detainees, who were 
charged with offenses ranging from illegal currency exchanges 
and smuggling to espionage for a foreign state, at 200. 
  The Jordanian Government is trying to solve this problem by 
reaching an understanding with the Iraqi authorities. 
  The sources also say that during his visit to Baghdad, 
al-Tall reached an agreement with the Iraqi officials on 
organizing a meeting between the interior ministers of the two 
countries in order to tackle unsolved issues facing the 
Jordanian nationals in Iraqi jails.

Embassy To Extort Jordanians and Recruit Them Into Its 
Intelligence; the U.S. Embassy Offers Incentives To Hunt Iraqis 
and Obtain Information About Iraq"] 
  [Text] Amman -- The U.S. Embassy in Amman has provided many 
incentives to attract Iraqis wishing to emigrate to the United 
States. It set aside a special place for daily meetings at the 
embassy and appointed an intelligence team that tells the 
queuing petitioners every morning that "any Iraqi with important 
information to declare should step forward?!" 
  Eyewitnesses said three Iraqi women stepped out of a queue 
of 
150 persons when they heard the question and were immediately 
taken into the embassy. That day only these three women were 
granted visas while all other applications were rejected. 
  An applicant said the U.S. Embassy introduced two surprising 
articles and questions into the amended visa application forms. 
These are: Do you have important information [to declare], and 
do you know anything about underground and terrorist 
organizations and their places? Applicants say Palestinians, 
too, might be asked these questions.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Kurayshan] </F>
  [Excerpts] The public prosecutor of the State Security 
Court has issued a decision dismissing the case of seven 
Jordanian Afghan defendants. The public prosecutor announced 
that the case does not fall within the court's jurisdiction and 
that he would refer the case to the attorney of the State 
Security Court, who should refer it to the competent judicial 
quarters. 
  The decision stated that the State Security Court charged 
the defendants with participation in a conspiracy to carry out 
terrorist acts and planning to commit crimes against people and 
public funds. 
  The decision said that, after investigating this case and 
studying it in detail, the public prosecutor of the State 
Security Court became convinced that the first defendant, Bura', 
and the second, Yahya, are members of the Jordanian Afghan 
movement who had left Jordan for Afghanistan in 1989 where they 
received military training. They stayed there for over a year, 
during which time they took part in the war there. In 1991, 
they returned to Jordan. 
  In 1993, the two defendants got together again and discussed 
the idea of establishing a religious jihad organization that 
seeks to remove vice by force and to achieve the highest 
objective of this organization, the establishment of an Islamic 
state. The two set out the objectives of the organizations as 
follows: 
  1. Declaring as infidel the ruling regime in Jordan and all 
its civil and military institutions. 
  2. Attacking the state's civilian and military personnel, 
since they are followers of the ruling regime. 
  3. Assassinating certain Jordanian personalities, 
including intellectuals, economists, and men of letters. 
  4. Blowing up the Parliament building, since it is the 
legislative authority that passes legislation conflicting with 
the Holy Koran. 
  5. Smashing movie theaters and liquor stores inside the 
Kingdom. 
  6. Declaring as infidel women who do not wear an Islamic 
veil and considering them prisoners of war. 
  The two defendants, Bura' and Yahya, then began looking for 
sources to finance this organization, especially to acquire 
weapons and pay for the expenses and financial obligations of 
the members of the organization. Consequently, the second 
defendant, Yahya, issued a ruling sanctioning the theft of funds 
from non-Muslims and considering the money they get from those 
people war spoils, as long as those people do not pay Islamic 
tax for their stay in a Muslim country. The second defendant 
also sanctioned the theft of bank funds which, they argue, are 
usurious. He also said it was permissible to take the money of 
a Muslim who does not pay alms tax either by force or by fraud. 
  In accordance with this edict, the two defendants agreed to 
rob several stores and banks, such as the Arab Bank, Umm 
al-Summaq branch, and a goldsmith in al-Fuhays. They also 
planned to attack foot patrols to kill them, since they follow 
an infidel ruling regime, and to seize their weapons. 
  The two defendants also agreed to recruit other elements to 
this organization. Thus, the first defendant, Bura', recruited 
another defendant, Wa'il, after explaining to him the aims of 
the organization and the methods it would adopt to achieve these 
aims. 
  On 17 November 1993, defendant Yahya left Jordan for Saudi 
Arabia where he was arrested, while the first defendant, Bura', 
and the third defendant, Wa'il, began to prepare for the thefts 
that were agreed upon among the three defendants. Wa'il bought 
a 7-mm pistol [as published] for 400 dinars and two tear gas 
grenades to be used in the theft operations. [passage omitted] 
  After verification, it has become clear that the established 
facts here are not in conformity with the provisions and 
elements of the first charge against the defendants; namely, 
participating in a conspiracy to carry out acts of terrorism, 
and that the actions carried out by all the defendants, even if 
proved to be true, do not constitute more than an offense, or an 
agreement to perpetrate crimes against people and their funds in 
violation of the provisions of Articles 157/1 and 158/3 of the 
Penal Code No. 16 of 1960. 
  Since this offense, even if proven true, does not fall 
within 
the jurisdiction of the State Security Court in accordance with 
the provisions of Article 3 of the State Security Court Law No. 
17 of 1959, amended by Law No. 6 of 1993, I have decided to 
dismiss the case as not falling within my jurisdiction, and to 
refer the file of the case to the attorney of the State Security 
Court to refer it to the competent judicial quarters. 
  The defendants are: 
  1. Bura' Ghanim 'Abduh, alias Abu-Malik, 33 years old. 
  2. Yahya Ibrahim al-Zughli, alias Abu-Humam, 35 years old. 
  3. Wa'il Rashid al-Waza'ifi, 24 years old. 
  4. Ahmad Nasuh al-Waza'ifi, 26 years old. 
  5. Ahmad Musa Naji 'Amirah, 25 years old. 
  6. Isma'il 'Abd-al-Wadud al-'Isawi, 22 years old. 
  7. 'Ali Muhammad Mahmud al-Faqih, 24 years old.

  [Excerpt] The first press festival ended this afternoon 
with a speech by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani and the 
presentation of prizes to the outstanding press in the country. 
  In his speech, the president considered the progress of the 
country's press to be towards perfection and described the press 
festival as a necessity for this stage in the era of the 
reconstruction of the country. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed the need for press freedom 
in 
the country and added: Press freedom in Iran is at a very high 
level. Even those in the press who do not have a friendly 
approach enjoy the same freedom. 
  The president stressed the need for the press to come to the 
aid of the government when necessary and added: When the 
British Government embarked on a hue and cry against us in the 
current month [Iranian month beginning 21 April] as a preemptive 
action after a bugging device was discovered at the Iranian 
Embassy, the press did not show any perceptiveness [hassasiyyat 
neshan-nadadand]. Professionals realize the press should come to 
the aid of the government at such times. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, May 11, IRNA -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman 
told IRNA here tonight that the British Government in violation 
of all diplomatic regulations had bugged the Iranian Embassy in 
London. 
  Asked when the earliest evidences was found in this 
connection, Mahmoud Mohammadi said the earliest signs were 
discovered three weeks ago. 
  "Naturally after the discovery of the first clue, the 
embassy 
staff tried to complete their investigations for the discovery 
of all the (eavesdropping) devices, and this needed time," 
Mohammadi said in answer to a question as to why the issue was 
not disclosed earlier. 
  Of course, he said, the British officials saw themselves 
facing a big scandal as soon as they felt the first disruptions 
in their bugging system, thus accusing Iran of collaboration 
with I.R.A. 
  The accusations covered by the British press were mocked 
even 
by other European press, some of them describing the British 
claims as "sheer propaganda."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Ministry spokesman </F>
Mohammadi by unidentified station announcer--live] 
  [Text] Esteemed listeners, my colleague informed you in the 
news that last night President Hashemi-Rafsanjani exposed 
Britain's degradation in carrying out anti-Iranian espionage 
activities. To give you more information on the issue, let us 
speak to Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammadi on the telephone 
right now: 
  [Announcer] As you know, our president revealed the British 
espionage activities against Iran. We will be grateful if you 
can provide more details for our listeners. When was the affair 
discovered? 
  [Mohammadi] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. In the first week of Ordibehesht [21 April-21 May], 
when work was being carried out on one of the walls in our 
embassy in London, workers found a British electronic 
surveillance device planted in the wall. The issue was assessed 
so that all the British espionage activities might be 
investigated and every action that contravenes diplomatic 
parlance and the Vienna Convention regarding Britain's official 
espionage might be exposed. 
  The British politicians tried to preempt this with a hasty 
defensive reaction to cover up this aberration and actions that 
violate diplomatic practices. They thus committed another 
blunder. They propounded the issue of our collaboration with the 
IRA. 
  [Announcer] Thank you. It appears that in its efforts to 
cover up its humiliation stemming from its espionage, the London 
government is pursuing other objectives with this propaganda 
clamor. How do you appraise Britain's overall objectives with 
this latest propaganda outcry? 
  [Mohammadi] Initially, these were attempts to conceal the 
espionage affair and violation of diplomatic practices and 
ethics. At the same time, Britain sought to mask the domestic 
problems with which it has been grappling for quite some time. 
By raising such issues in its foreign policy, Britain aims to 
divert attention from internal and external policy issues. 
  We must mention our diplomatic efforts and moves regarding 
the rights of the oppressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
conflict between our support for Bosnia-Herzegovina and British 
policy. In this context the hue and cry raised by the British 
was designed to counteract our policy. When the British 
perceived their vulnerability and isolation in their support of 
Rushdie against Muslim public opinion they were forced to 
concoct a new issue to divert their public and replace the 
Rushdie issue in this manner. 
  As a result, the objective pursued by Britain was that world 
attention should be directed toward a new issue that would in 
some way relate to the United States' accusatory and domineering 
policies against the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  [Announcer] I thank you for your explanations and Your 
Excellency's participation in this talk. 
  [Mohammadi] I thank you. Goodbye. 
  Esteemed listeners, the latest news given to me by my 
colleagues cites the BBC quoting a British Government spokesman 
on the revelations of London's espionage against the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. The spokesman said: We have nothing to say 
in this regard.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] The news of the espionage committed by British 
security officials who installed surveillance devices in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy in London, an incident that 
was revealed yesterday by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, removes 
the veil from a series of ambiguities relating to Britain's 
latest allegations against Iran. 
  Our president, who was addressing the press festival 
yesterday, said the British Government violated international 
norms by planting a secret microphone in our embassy in London. 
It also raised the controversy of collaboration between Iran 
and the IRA. 
  About two weeks ago, the British Foreign Office claimed that 
its security personnel had discovered documentary evidence that 
the Islamic Republic of Iran was providing funds to the IRA 
through its agents and was seeking to plan to deliver weapons to 
the IRA too. These claims were immediately endorsed by the 
minister for Northern Ireland affairs in the House of Commons. 
But not much had happened when a spokesman for Sinn Fein--the 
political wing of the IRA-- refuted the British claim as a 
baseless shot in the dark and unfounded propaganda, adding: To 
eclipse its defeat in organizing peace talks on Ireland, the 
British Government has resorted to such accusations. 
  Similarly, three days after the British allegations against 
the Islamic Republic of Iran and following a swift and 
categorical rebuttal by our officials, London's newspapers 
revealed that the accusations by John Major's government were 
totally unfounded and bereft of any grounds or evidence. In 
this regard, THE SUNDAY TIMES, in its 1 May edition, wrote: The 
British Government has no acceptable documentary evidence to 
present to the court. 
  It thus appears that the veteran statesmen of London 
resorted 
to espionage and an overt violation of international laws by 
planting listening devices in our embassy to pursue objectives 
that were more important than their international credibility 
and reputation. Many possibilities can be enumerated in an 
analysis of these actions and London's desired objectives. No 
one should ignore that John Major's government and the 
Conservative party led by him are confronting serious problems 
stemming from a dichotomy in the party. This problem is so 
crucial that there is talk of the resignation of John Major's 
government. 
  Despite the defensive action by the British Government in 
leveling charges against the Islamic Republic of Iran being 
nipped in the bud, and neither British officials nor the British 
rumormongering newspapers presenting any plausible evidence of 
Iran's support for the Irish secessionists, the British 
Government strove to initiate this unfounded rumor in a 
so-called preemptive move to prevent humiliation regarding its 
espionage activities in the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy. 
  The British Government--by trampling international laws 
underfoot--has confirmed that it attaches no importance to its 
commitments to international rights and diplomatic immunity and 
that when the country's interests dictate, it considers any 
illegal activity justified. 
  As a country professing reciprocal respect for others' 
rights, Britain has--by its recent acts of espionage in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy--again revealed its 
interventionist and aggressive nature. The past record of 
espionage is nothing new for the British echelons. They believe 
that the colonial world of past centuries continues and that 
Britain has the right to interfere in others' affairs and to 
trample upon diplomatic immunity. 
  For such countries, wholesome relations based on reciprocal 
interests have no meaning. What is important is getting 
information and capitalizing on the amicable approach of the 
other side. The issue of British spying on the Islamic Republic 
of Iran's Embassy is not the first such incident. It is 
certainly not the last. Every country should be vigilant, aware 
that such intentions and actions might not be confined to one 
embassy in Britain alone.

  [Text] In an interview with the deputy foreign minister for 
European and American affairs, a few minutes ago, our 
correspondent asked him to give further details about the 
espionage action by British agents against Iran. 
  During the interview, Mr. Va'ezi gave a detailed description 
of the spying equipment installed at the Iranian Embassy in 
London and how it was discovered, He also described the Foreign 
Ministry's actions on the matter. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi, 
if 
possible please give our dear listeners more details on the 
discovery of the British Government eavesdropping device at the 
Iranian Embassy in London. 
  [Va'ezi] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. 
About two weeks ago, when tearing down a wall in the new Iranian 
Embassy building in London, we discovered a bug installed and 
realized that a bug had been placed there. With the discovery 
of the bug, because of intelligence and operational 
considerations, and in order to conduct further investigation, 
we did not disclose the matter and continued our investigations 
until it was made public yesterday. 
  The bug weighs about half a kilogram. A battery has been 
fitted inside it. It has a number of parts and in effect acts 
as a transmitter. In any case, this is the latest thing we can 
announce in connection with the bug. 
  [Correspondent] Please tell us what measures the Iranian 
Foreign Ministry has so far taken in response to this action of 
the British Government? 
  [Va'ezi] After our investigation at the embassy was 
concluded 
the British Embassy's charge d'affaires in Tehran was summoned 
today by the director general for Western Europe. A strong 
protest was made against this action of the British Government. 
We asked them to give us more explanations as quickly as 
possible. In any case, future explanations by the British 
Government will determine the next steps. 
  Basically, we consider this and the British Government's 
behavior toward us as a weak point in our relations and in line 
with Britain's overall policy on Iran. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you very much. 
  [Va'ezi] Thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] The discovery of a microphone in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's Embassy in London has exposed the espionage 
activities of the British Government against our country. This 
microphone, concealed inside a wall, had been transmitting the 
ongoing talks and conversations in the Iranian Embassy in London 
to Britain's espionage apparatus. 
  The action of the British Government in eavesdropping and 
diplomatic espionage in the embassy is totally contrary to 
international laws and is considered as interference in our 
country's internal affairs. The embassy of a country is 
regarded as that country's territory and, on the basis of the 
Vienna 1961 Convention, enjoys special privileges and immunity. 
The British Conservative government therefore, by resorting to 
espionage in the Iranian Embassy, has violated the Iran's 
sovereignty, too. 
  The British Government, which considers itself the vanguard 
of international law, human rights, the fight against terrorism, 
and other similar titles, has directly resorted to espionage 
inside the Iranian Embassy in London. Almost simultaneously 
with the exposure of the British espionage activity in our 
London embassy, John Major's government, in order to provide a 
cover for this huge disgrace, began some baseless propaganda on 
contacts between Iran and the Irish Republican Army. This show 
was not even effective in Britain, so much so that the British 
press and media too confessed that these allegations are false 
and vague. 
  Unfortunately Britain, this permanent member of the Security 
Council and the so-called protector of international peace and 
security -- the same as some of its western allies -- is 
pursuing its anti-human objectives without care for any 
regulations and law. This country's behavior in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina issue has exposed in the best possible manner 
the true face of this so-called free democratic state. Britain 
brings pressure to bear on any state which opposes its policies, 
by resorting to such accusations as human rights violations, 
attempting to obtain nuclear weapons, and terrorism. Whereas 
Britain itself is classed as one of the major international 
lawbreakers.

<F P=106> [From the news desk] </F>
  [Text] The British Government radio [BBC] announced last 
night that 100 writers and broad-minded [rowshanfekran] persons 
abroad, who have fled Iran, sent a letter to Butrus-Ghali 
expressing concern about the fate of 'Ali Akbar Sa'idi-Sirjani. 
  Support for Sa'idi-Sirjani by this group of broad-minded 
individuals comes at a time when a number of so-called writers 
in Iran have also tried to lobby for Sa'idi-Sirjani. 
  It is worth mentioning that Sa'idi-Sirjani has been charged 
with smuggling of drugs and with corruption and was arrested a 
while ago by antidrug officials. 
  One of these broad-minded persons who supports 
Sa'idi-Sirjani 
told our correspondent: The charges leveled against 
Sa'idi-Sirjani are not unforgivable sins, as most of the writers 
and broad-minded persons indulge in taking drugs. 
  In answer to a question on his views about the smuggling of 
drugs, he said: The court should prove this charge. 
  When asked what was the meaning of the collecting of 
signatures at home and abroad, he said: If the government 
arrests people for these reasons, there are many who will be 
concerned! 
  It may be mentioned that on 25 April the director general of 
internal security of the Information Ministry announced in an 
interview that Sa'idi-Sirjani and Niaz Kermani were members of 
the SAVAK [shah's intelligence organization] and have admitted 
to the transporting, distribution, and use of drugs. They have 
also confessed to producing, stocking, and distributing liquor 
and to immoral acts.

  [Text] Tehran, May 10, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani said on Tuesday that inking any peace 
accord without the consent of the Palestinian people was a "big 
insult" to that nation. 
  "A real peace can be established only through Israel's 
unconditional compliance with U.N. resolutions, return of 
Palestinian refugees to their homeland and holding of a 
referendum," Rowhani told Canadian Ambassador to Iran Donald 
McLennan. 
  Rowhani, who is the secretary of the Supreme National 
Security Council (SNSC) reiterated that Palestine was not 
confined to a single person and that it was the Palestinian 
nation that should give final approval to such an important 
issue as peace. 
  "We have time and again expressed our views on the 
Palestinian issue...we have never decided, nor will we ever 
decide, to take a military action in the region," he said. 
  The Iranian parliamentarian maintained that it is only the 
Palestinian people, and no one else, who can make decision on 
the fate of Palestine. "What has been signed by (Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasir) 'Arafat is an insult to 
the Palestinian people," he said. He felt confident that the 
Palestinian people will one day seize power as the majority 
black people of South Africa did. 
  The Majles vice speaker also criticized the United Nations 
for its failure to fulfil its duties in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
defiance of its charter. 
  He said that in view of the sensitivity of the Persian Gulf 
region as a key energy supply center, Iran's strong presence in 
the region has always guaranteed security of the region and will 
continue to do so in the future. 
  Pointing to the importance of parliamentary relations 
between 
Iran and Canada, Rowhani called for exchange of delegations 
between the parliaments two countries.

  [Text] Tehran, May 10, IRNA -- Within three months since 
the tragedy in February of opening fire at Palestinian 
worshippers at the town of al-Khalil [Hebron], Yasir 'Arafat 
betrayed more than 46 years of resistance and struggle for 
liberation of Palestine. He revived the shameful memory of Camp 
David through signing of an accord with the Zionist regime. 
Signing the accord was followed by waves of violence and 
people's hatred against the PLO leaders and the Zionist regime. 
  The accord known as limited self-rule in Gaza and Jericho 
was 
signed in Cairo on May 4 between PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and 
Prime Minister of the Zionist regime Yitzhaq Rabin. Even the 
most optimistic observers doubt the successful implementation of 
the accord in view of its ambiguity. Palestinian activists 
believe that the intifada will determine the fate of Palestine 
and that the Palestinian nation will never betray the blood of 
thousands of Palestinian martyrs. 
  An expert on the Middle East issues, Dr. Amir Reza'i, told 
IRNA Tuesday that the Gaza-Jericho plan was an obvious treason 
to the cause of Palestine and the main objective of the plan was 
to suppress intifada. He said the Zionist regime is now trying 
to sow discord among the Palestinians in an attempt to eliminate 
their movement. The extensive protest movement in Jericho, Gaza 
Strip, Halhul, al-Khalil and Ramallah in recent days showed that 
the plan of the Zionists will not succeed and remain a mirage 
for Israeli leaders, he said. 
  A general study of the plan formulated by the United States, 
Russia and some other western states in Madrid conference in 
1991 indicated that the only matter that they ignored was the 
interests of the Palestinians, Reza'i said.

  [Text] In a meeting last night with Japanese Government 
officials and industrialists in Tokyo, our country's oil 
minister said: The Islamic Republic of Iran gives special 
priority to meeting Japan's oil and gas needs and it welcomes 
investment in and help toward the development of gas and oil 
fields by foreign companies, including Japanese ones, within the 
framework of the country's second development plan. 
  Mr. Gholamreza Aqazadeh added: The Islamic Republic of Iran 
is, undoubtedly, an important gateway to activity in Central 
Asia and, with this in mind and in view of Iran's exceptional 
geographic position, the cooperation of Japanese companies in 
production in Iran with the aim of exporting to Central Asia and 
to Persian Gulf littoral countries is one of the interesting 
possibilities worth considering in the framework of cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  Our country's oil minister and his accompanying delegation 
will leave Tokyo today for Seoul for a four-day visit to South 
Korea.

  [Text] Iranian Commerce Minister Yahya ol-Eshaq today 
proposed that the Iranian Government explore grounds for the 
establishment of extensive relations with the African states. 
  Speaking at a seminar on promotion of economic ties with 
Africa, the commerce minister said: The government should 
prepare the grounds for the establishment of extensive economic 
ties with Africa by providing transport, banking, and insurance 
facilities as well as export guarantees and information. He 
said: The fact that there are 450 million Muslims living in the 
African continent makes it imperative to broaden Iran's ties 
with that continent on the basis of mutual interest. He added: 
The Iranian airlines and shipping companies are ready to invest 
in this field in an effort to promote economic relations between 
Iran and the African countries. He told the seminar that in 
1992 only 2.09 percent of Iran's total exports were supplied to 
Africa and only 0.58 percent of the goods imported to the 
country came from that continent.

  [Text] The sum of $2 billion in foreign exchange and 703.17 
trillion rials in domestic currency has been earmarked for the 
provision of basic goods and necessities. Announcing this today 
in a joint seminar held in Tehran by the heads of provincial 
trade associations and the directors of provincial commercial 
centers, Commerce Minister ol-Eshaq added: $800 million of this 
amount have been earmarked for subsidies for basic goods and 
$700 million for maintaining price equilibrium; in addition, 
$500 million have been earmarked for such necessities as paper, 
ironware, and tires. All of this will be calculated on the 
basis of foreign exchange at the rate of 1,750 rials. 
  He added: This year, the sum of 3.17 trillion rials in 
domestic currency has also been earmarked for subsidies for 
basic goods and the sum of 700 billion rials for subsidizing 
agricultural organizations. This amount represents a 70 percent 
growth over the previous year and, on this basis, we will see no 
price rises in these areas this year. 
  Mr. ol-Eshaq also referred to a proposal for regulating the 
market, which was recently approved by the organization for the 
protection of producers and consumers and by the economic 
council, and said: With the implementation of this proposal, 
from 1 Khordad [month beginning 22 May 1994], all goods will be 
priced, and this will create a framework for issues relating to 
foreign exchange rates, preventing price upheavals, and 
clarifying the trend of goods prices.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Press commentaries today highlight the upcoming 
visit of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the 
region to advance the peace process. They also speak about 
Israel's continued circumvention of the peace process. 
  In its editorial, TISHRIN comments on U.S. efforts to 
advance 
the peace process, and notes the upcoming visit of U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the region next 
Saturday. The paper discusses the ideas conveyed by Christopher 
to Syria during his recent talks with President Hafiz al-Asad, 
saying: Informed quarters revealed at the time that the 
proposals conveyed by Christopher from Israel to Syrian 
officials during his recent visit did not include anything new. 
The ideas turned the priorities of the peace process upside 
down. 
  TISHRIN adds: Instead of Israel's public commitment to full 
withdrawal from the occupied territories in line with Security 
Council resolutions and the Madrid conference foundations, the 
Israeli ideas focused on security arrangements and then a peace 
treaty, and withdrawal eventually being achieved over a long 
period of time. Israel, in other words, would secure security 
and peace in advance. As for the land, it will continue to be 
under Israeli occupation and blackmail. 
  Syria has made it clear to Secretary Christopher that full 
and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal is a top priority and that 
peace and security are a consequence of withdrawal and not the 
opposite. 
  After pointing out that Israel has dragged the Palestinians 
into the trap of autonomy and deprived them of their rights, 
TISHRIN adds: The land is the basic factor of conflict, and 
there can be no peace or security without the return of the 
land, which means regaining all of the Golan; Lebanon regaining 
its southern part in full; Jordan regaining its occupied 
territory; and the return of the evacuee and displaced Syrians, 
Lebanese, and Jordanians to their land. Any solution to our 
conflict with Israel that is not based on returning the land is 
futile and has no future. 
  TISHRIN concludes: It is well known that Syria has insisted, 
right from the very beginning, on a comprehensive and just 
solution in the Middle East that ensures the implementation of 
Security Council resolutions to the letter, and consequently, 
the return of all the occupied territories. Syria has also 
rejected phased settlements and partial solutions and insisted 
on a just and comprehensive peace. It is enough for us to look 
at the Gaza- Jericho reality and the Palestinians' 
across-the-board displeasure to see the soundness of Syria's 
attitude and its concept of a true, honorable peace in the 
Middle East. 
  Peace does not agree with occupation and expansion and 
hegemony. There can be no peace without full Israeli withdrawal. 
  Under the headline "Syria Will Not Relinquish Any Iota of 
Rights," AL-BA'TH writes: Once again, there is news about a 
visit to the region shortly by the U.S. secretary of state to 
advance the peace process. The visit might include shuttle 
tours that serve his mission. 
  The paper adds: Israeli sources have acknowledged that the 
gap is still wide between the proposals made by Israel and 
conveyed by the U.S. secretary to Damascus recently and the 
Syrian reply to these proposals. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: If we contrast the two positions, it is 
possible to assert that the Rabin government has continued to 
try to circumvent the peace process and evade a serious 
discussion that addresses the substance of this process. This 
is done through adopting the principle of separate solutions and 
partial deals. 
  The paper stresses that just and comprehensive peace in the 
region will not be achieved except through commitment to the 
principle of full and comprehensive withdrawal from all the 
occupied Arab territories, in line with the foundations of the 
peace process to which Syria has committed itself as a strategic 
option. 
  It is natural, therefore, that the gap will remain wide 
between the Syrian and Israeli positions, as a result of the 
Rabin government's rejection of the peace initiative and Syria's 
commitment to this initiative. 
  The paper concludes that separate solutions do not serve 
peace. Depending on the Oslo accord is a trick that is 
convincing only to those who abandon pan-Arab rights. Syria can 
never relinquish an iota of these rights.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] In its editorial, AL-BA'TH discusses the U.S. 
secretary of state's new tour in the region. It says: It is 
almost certain that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
will return to the region next Saturday [14 May] and that his 
tour may be limited to shuttle missions between Syria and Israel 
in an attempt, as he has said, to activate the stagnant peace 
talks and, hence, crystallize a formula that will push the peace 
process forward. 
  It is well known that the U.S. secretary was in the region 
not long ago. In that tour, he tried to bring about some 
progress on the Israeli-Syrian track. That objective, however, 
was not achieved because of the Israeli position that remained 
unchanged, refusing to abide by the resolutions of international 
legitimacy, on whose basis the peace process was started. 
Several Western, and even Israeli media organs, have reported 
the U.S. Administration's dismay over the proposals which 
Christopher conveyed to Syria. 
  The paper believes the U.S. Administration has felt that the 
Israeli proposals are unable to push the peace process in the 
direction of achieving the just and comprehensive peace. 
Therefore, one can say that the Israeli proposals, as stressed 
by Syria, aim only to escape blame and do not serve the peace 
process and the conditions for its success. They only mean a 
new attempt to circumvent the peace process as a whole. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: If the peace process is to follow its correct 
path, then Israel should announce its complete and absolute 
compliance with the implementation of the resolutions of 
international legitimacy as an initial and basic step to achieve 
progress that would in turn achieve the desired peace. 
  The paper adds: Anything else would mean that Israel is 
continuing with the policy of maneuvering and procrastination 
out of its belief that it may be able to achieve other 
agreements, similar to the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Here, we 
must stress once again that Syria, which is working very 
seriously on achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region, will continue to reject the incomplete peace, the peace 
that would not return rights to their rightful owners. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: We hope that Christopher's new tour will 
carry practical ideas to activate the stagnant peace process and 
place the region on the path of the just and comprehensive peace. 
  On the same subject, TISHRIN says in an editorial entitled 
"Christopher and the Israeli Obstacle:" : Rabin's government 
opposes any move toward the genuine peace, even if such a move 
comes from Washington. Warren Christopher knows this fact and 
knows for certain that Rabin's government has always sought to 
undermine the Madrid formula and suspended the Washington talks. 
He also knows that Israel abhors the principle of just and 
comprehensive settlement and prefers, instead, to sign separate, 
secret deals, similar to the one it struck with the PLO, that 
would give Israel everything, deprive the Arabs of their rights, 
and maintain the Israeli occupation and hegemony in the region. 
Therefore, the results of Christopher's forthcoming tour will 
not be different from those of previous tours if the United 
States continues to refuse to apply pressure on Israel and 
continues to supply it with all kinds of advanced weapons. 
  TISHRIN adds: President Clinton's administration has 
announced its compliance with the principle of comprehensive 
settlement that is based on the UN resolutions. Syria and the 
other Arab parties have responded positively to that U.S. trend. 
Only Israel rejected that principle and undermined all the 
opportunities that were made available in the region to achieve 
the just and permanent peace. This is the reality, which 
Washington is certainly aware of. It also knows that the 
Israeli obstacle is the one that prevented any success in the 
U.S. initiative and progress in the peace process. 
  The paper believes that if the U.S. secretary wants his 
forthcoming tour to succeed, then his efforts must be directed 
toward removing this obstacle and overcoming the difficulties 
which the Rabin government is fabricating in the face of the 
peace process. 
  The paper adds: This will only be achieved when Washington 
translates its peace intentions into reality and abandons the 
mailman role and exercises real pressure on Rabin's government 
to force it to accept the principles for establishing a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region. 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: If the U.S. secretary manages 
to remove the Israeli obstacle and the mines which the Rabin 
government has placed on the path of peace, then the chances for 
success in his mission will certainly be guaranteed. Only then 
will the region enter a new era of the comprehensive and just 
peace that will end all forms of aggression, injustice, and 
occupation.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Our Firm Stand," the newspaper 
AL-THAWRAH says: Syria has always proved it truly wants peace 
based on UN resolutions and the principles of international law. 
It has shown during all stages of the peace process that it is 
ready to respond to any effort to entrench the bases of a just 
and comprehensive peace that will ensure an end to injustice and 
occupation. AL-THAWRAH notes that Syria has repeatedly 
announced that the peace for which it is working and exerting 
every effort is the peace that can lead to Israel's withdrawal 
from the Golan and all other occupied Arab territories, that can 
entrench the values of right and justice, and that can lead to 
the restoration of all Arab rights. 
  The newspaper adds: Syria has rejected phased steps and 
unilateral solutions and has stood firmly against Israeli 
attempts to divide the solution. This is because Syria depends, 
in its peaceful trends, on objective and logic realities, which 
no one can deny or ignore, foremost of which is the reality that 
peace cannot come in installments or stages and that if it is 
not just and comprehensive, it will not be a real and 
deep-rooted peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH stresses that Syria has offered all it can to 
preserve the credibility of the peace process and to save the 
process from any deviation from its specified goals. Moreover, 
Syria has always resorted to UN resolutions and the law of 
international legitimacy to refute Israel's allegations, to 
prevent its calls for partial and unilateral solutions, and to 
prove the futility of these offers. 
  Concluding, the newspaper says: There is no doubt that 
Syria's eagerness to provide a suitable climate to make the 
peace process successful comes from its concern about regaining 
all the Arab territories and rights and also from its desire to 
save the region from the whirlpools of confusion and instability 
that are threatening more war disasters and tragedies. Syria 
adheres to this noble goal that is sought by all nations and to 
the peace process as a valuable and important opportunity that 
should lead to a real and strong peace. 
  The newspaper TISHRIN writes in its editorial on the 
atmosphere of disappointment and bitterness, which the occupied 
Arab territories are experiencing as a result of the signing of 
the self-rule accord. It points out that our kinsfolk in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip are still in shock because the accord 
has resulted in certain arrangements and measures that have 
given Israel all it wants, including occupation; control of 
crossing points, bridges, and roads; security and protection for 
the settlers; and absolute Israeli sovereignty over political, 
defense, and foreign affairs. 
  TISHRIN notes that the accord will protect and achieve 
Israel's goals in devouring and controlling territories. This, 
the paper says, indicates that by signing the self-rule accord, 
Israel has lifted a heavy burden from its shoulders, namely, its 
complete failure to guarantee security for its occupation and 
its settlers and to confront and limit the intifadah. 
  TISHRIN adds: The accords' stipulations, annexes, and maps 
conflict with the Palestinian people's will, have made gains for 
the occupation, and are aimed at liquidating the Palestinian 
people's right to independence, freedom, and self-determination. 
This conflict, the paper says, will not last because nations' 
fate cannot be determined by fragile accords or unilateral 
policies that have nothing to do with nations' rights and real 
trends toward full independence. 
  TISHRIN asserts that the current insistence in the occupied 
West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem on the continuation of the 
intifadah against the occupied forces and settlers is viewed as 
part of our people's determination not to bow to the policy of 
concession that began with the Oslo talks and that produced an 
agreement that emptied the peace process of its essence. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: It is natural for the Arab parties 
taking part in the peace process, namely, Syrian, Lebanon, and 
Jordan, to hasten to coordinate their positions and stress their 
adherence to the principles of a just and comprehensive solution 
and to the Madrid conference formula that calls for Israel's 
total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.

  [Text] Tahir al-Husami, head of the Foreign Ministry's 
Department of International Organizations and Conferences, this 
morning presented a Foreign Ministry statement to the [UN] 
committee investigating Israeli violations of human rights in 
the Golan and the occupied Arab territories. The committee is 
led by Stanley Kalpage, Sri Lanka's ambassador to the United 
Nations. 
  The statement notes that Israel used all sorts of methods 
that violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
Geneva Conventions of 1949, and the Hague Conventions of 1907, 
as well as international humanitarian law, in order to change 
the identity of the territories and the people. Israel has also 
used these methods in order to judaize these territories and 
exploit their resources to plant settlements, settlers, and 
military fortifications in order to exercise oppression, 
repression, aggression, and expansion. 
  The statement says that, throughout the past few decades, it 
has become clear to the entire world how Israel has been 
destroying the villages and Arab features of the Golan, most 
notably the city of al-Qunaytirah. The number of villages and 
urban centers that have been wiped off the map has reached more 
than 240. Moreover, the number of inhabitants of Syrian Golan 
that have been displaced by Israel has reached more than 120,000 
people. Israel has plundered these people's resources and 
carried out a policy of removing the Arab identity of the 
occupied Golan and of obliterating its Arab features. 
  The statement also notes the Israeli's repressive methods 
and 
hostile policies against the Syrian Arab inhabitants, which are 
aimed at isolating them from their Arab surroundings and 
imposing an Israeli identity on them. The statement also notes 
the suffering of the inhabitants in terms of poverty and poor 
living, health, and educational conditions, in addition to 
fomenting sectarian hatred among the inhabitants. 
  The statement also notes that Israeli practices, which 
violate the human rights of the Palestinian and other Arab 
peoples in the occupied Arab territories, are a result of 
Israel's occupation of the Arab territories since 1967. The 
statement adds that Israel will not stop these practices unless 
the Israeli occupation of these territories is removed. 
  In conclusion, the statement says that Syria has provided a 
chance for a just and comprehensive peace that achieves Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan and the rest of the occupied Arab and 
Palestinian territories and secures the Palestinian people's 
rights to self-determination in implementation of UN resolutions 
and international legitimacy. However, Israel is still 
obstructing progress in the peace process. 
  Afterward, the committee met with a number of eyewitness 
deportees from the occupied territories. Members of the 
committee listened to the deportees' statements on Israeli 
practices and the methods of interrogation and torture used by 
the Israeli authorities against the Arab inhabitants. Moreover, 
the committee was briefed on practices by Israeli authorities on 
how the citizens are deported.

  [Text] Medina, May 11, IRNA -- Hajj is the best time to 
voice support for the Bosnian Muslims and hatred for the Serbs 
atrocities, said head of the Iranian hajj pilgrims Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri here Tuesday. Speaking to 
IRNA, Reyshahri said that the hajj season is the best time to 
set forth the problems of Muslims and to find solutions for 
them. That is why, he added, May 15 was announced the day for 
support of Bosnian Muslims. 
  Reyshahri who is also representative of the leader, said 
that 
while the arrogant world has practically given the green light 
to the racist Serbs to continue their crimes, Muslims are 
duty-bound to support the resistance of their Muslim brethren. 
He blasted the international organizations especially the 
United Nations for their silence and negligence towards Serbs 
crimes. 
  Deploring that the Serbs were massacring more Bosnian women, 
children and men every day due to the connivance of the U.N. and 
other world bodies, he said the continued arms embargo on Bosnia 
has made the Muslims defenceless against the criminal Serbs. He 
called for lifting of the arms sanctions imposed on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to prevent continuation of the 
bloodshed. 
  Reyshahri said that the U.N. insistence to continue the arms 
embargo only indicates the collaboration of the organization and 
the big powers dominating it with the Serbs. 
  Criticising the U.N. opposition with the dispatch of peace 
keeping forces from Islamic countries including Iran to Bosnia, 
he said that "it has only one meaning and that is the support of 
the United Nations, the powers dominating over the international 
body and the person of the secretary general for the criminal 
Serbs." Stressing that helping the oppressed Bosnians was a 
religious task, he called on all Iranian and non-Iranian 
pilgrims to assist Muslim Bosnians as much as they could on May 
15. 
  Funds will be set up at the site of Iranian hajj caravans to 
collect cash donations of the pilgrims in Mecca and Medina.

received a telephone call from 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice president 
of the Yemeni Republic, during which he explained to his 
highness the latest developments in Yemen. 
  During the telephone conversation, His Highness Shaykh Zayid 
Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan expressed the United Arab Emirates' 
willingness to continue its mediation to restore stability in 
Yemen on condition there is an immediate cease-fire and a return 
to true brotherly dialogue in order to reach a political 
solution to the Yemeni crisis based on the vision of the Yemeni 
leadership. 
  The responsible source added that his highness the 
president's appeal to the leaders of Yemen truly reflects his 
highness's concern to prevent the situation in Yemen from 
becoming a tragedy with dire results and to prepare the 
atmosphere for dialogue and understanding among the brothers in 
Yemen. The appeal also reflects his highness's concern that the 
brothers in Yemen should fully shoulder their national 
responsibilities, not widen their differences, and to put the 
interest of the Yemeni people above all interests because 
history does not (?forgive).

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, 11 May (WAKH)--Yemeni Minister of Oil and 
Mineral Resources Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun has announced that 
his visit to the United Arab Emirates [UAE] comes within a tour 
that will also take him to Egypt and Syria. In a statement to 
the Emirates News Agency, WAM, Bin-Husaynun said that during the 
visit he will convey a message from Yemeni Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al- Bid to His Highness UAE President Shaykh Zayid 
Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan. 
  The Yemeni minister denied that the ongoing conflict in 
Yemen 
is over oil, noting that oil was discovered in northern and 
southern Yemen before the unity and that there are big oil 
reserves in the North and South. He added that oil production 
projects are proceeding normally in the northern and southern 
oil fields. However, he said, exploration and drilling stopped 
at the beginning of the war operations. 
  Asked if it is possible to continue talks about merger in 
light of the ongoing war between the North and South, the Yemeni 
minister said that Aden is now speaking about unity and the 
accord document [signed in Amman]. He said: What is required 
is to implement the document in letter and spirit, otherwise 
nothing else will be accepted by the Yemeni people. 
  Asked about Sanaa's call for an immediate cease-fire 
provided 
that Aden recognizes legitimacy, the Yemeni oil and mineral 
resources minister said: Aden supports the cease-fire. It has 
responded to cease-fire calls by some Arab brothers out of its 
concern to stop Yemeni bloodshed.

  [Text] In a treacherous and cowardly act that can be 
committed only by hysterical people who sense that their demise 
is inevitable and who face the gloomy fate that awaits every 
murderer, the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] Command has fired its destructive 
long-range Scud missiles against civilian installations and 
residential quarters in Sanaa and other Yemeni cities in the 
northern and western governorates. A missile fell on a 
residential quarter in Sanaa at dawn today, martyring more than 
23 citizens, completely demolishing four houses, and damaging 
others. The bodies of a newly-wed couple, still in the first 
week of their marriage, were removed from under the rubble. 
  The masses that arrived on the scene condemned this criminal 
act that targets the lives of citizens -- women, children, and 
the elderly -- and denounced these vindictive actions carried 
out by the seccessionist clique in the YSP. These show the 
rancor this clique harbors toward the sons of our people. 
  Another missile fell on al-Rahidah Hospital the day before 
yesterday, killing many patients. 
  All these criminal acts are part of the attempt to undermine 
our people. However, these acts will only make our people more 
committed to unity and more insistent on defending it and 
protecting Constitutional legitimacy, and more determined to rid 
themselves of killers and murderers who have no qualms.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Ibrahim al-Ruba'i, deputy </F>
director of medical services at the military hospital, by an 
unidentified correspondent; date and place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Please proceed, Dr. Ibrahim. 
  [Al-Ruba'i] You are welcome. To begin with, I would like to 
thank you for your interest in this issue. In fact, what 
happened last night was a very horrible event. As usual, we 
sent cars, along with doctors and nurses, for an inspection. At 
the same time, approximately 35 killed or wounded people were 
evacuated. This figure includes nine dead children, women, old 
men, and youths. Naturally, the injuries varied from serious to 
slight injuries. All are now at the General Military Hospital. 
  [Correspondent] Dr. Ibrahim: Will there be any future 
effects from these missiles, or effects on those in the vicinity? 
  [Al-Ruba'i] Psychological cases do affect people in the 
surrounding area. These cases differ from one person to 
another, depending, of course, on individual will. Such cases 
will be referred to psychiatrists who can diagnose them. 
  [Correspondent] What about the hospital's capability to 
treat the wounded people? 
  [Al-Ruba'i] Praise be to God, there is good capability. 
There is coordination with the brothers in the Ministry of 
Health. As soon as we need specialists in some types of 
surgery, we refer the cases to the [word indistinct] hospital, 
for example, or to the Republican Hospital, or to Kuwait. 
However, the opposite can occur. There is a complete [word 
indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] Praise be to God. 
  [Al-Ruba'i] Praise be to God. May God grant us success. 
  [Correspondent] May God grant us success and save us from 
the catastrophes caused by the gang of apostasy and secession. 
May he also grant success to, and champion, our Army, the Army 
of Constitutional legitimacy. Thank you very much, Dr. Ibrahim 
al- Ruba'i, deputy director of medical services for medical 
affairs at the military hospital. 
  [Al-Ruba'i] You are welcome.

  [Text] A military source today made the following statement: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. In 
continuation of their treacherous, criminal acts and in a 
hysterical act that can be carried out only by cowardly people 
who bear a grudge against the people and the homeland, the gang 
of rebellion and secession after midnight yesterday fired two 
long-range Scud missiles against civilian installations and 
residential quarters in the Governorate of Sanaa. 
  One of the missiles fell in the early hours today on one of 
the populated quarters in the city of Sanaa. Its explosion 
destroyed four houses. As a result, 23 people were martyred and 
30 others sustained various injuries. Seven other houses were 
destroyed. An entire family was martyred in this criminal, 
sinful incident. 
  The source condemned this cowardly act that targeted the 
life 
of citizens and innocent women and children. 
  The source said these acts of revenge, practiced by the 
secessionist clique in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party, reflect the 
extent of the inveterate grudge in the hearts of this clique 
against the sons of our people. These acts reflect the bitter 
defeat tasted by this clique. 
  The source said these criminal acts will only increase our 
people's cohesion and resolve to score a great success for unity 
and Constitutional legitimacy.

  [Text] The House of Representatives held a session this 
morning under brother Muhammad al-Khadim al-Wajih, member of the 
House chairmanship board. At the beginning of the session, the 
House listened to and approved the minutes of its previous 
session. Afterward, the House discussed a number of issues 
related to developments in the country, particularly the 
indiscriminate attacks on densely populated urban areas with 
internationally-banned Scud missiles by the secessionist 
elements in the Socialist Party's leadership, something which 
points out its despair, fear, and miscalculation. On this 
issue, the House approved tasking the human rights and public 
liberties committee with visiting the houses which were 
demolished over their (?secure) residents while they were asleep 
in Sanaa, Ta'izz, and (?other cities) which were hit by the 
internationally-banned Scud missiles. The committee has been 
entrusted with preparing a [word indistinct] report on what is 
going on. 
  The House tasked the Foreign Relations Committee with 
discussing the statements issued by a number of parliaments in 
sisterly Arab states on the situation and developments 
experienced by our country, and to prepare a draft statement on 
that issue and submit it to the House for (?approval). 
  The deputies praised the intensive efforts to distribute the

  [Text] O sons of beloved Aden; O sons of proud Yemen: The 
gang of apostasy and secession, led by the criminal and killer 
al-Bid, knows quite well that precious Aden is now within the 
range of the rifles of the forces of unity and legitimacy. 
However, these forces have noble values and objectives that 
stem from their concern about all the sons of our people, 
especially the residents of beloved Aden. This is why these 
forces would never permit terrorizing the residents of the city 
of Aden or any other city. 
  But this treacherous gang that has abandoned all religious 
and moral values is determined to provoke the feelings of our 
people and the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy by 
striking at residential neighborhoods in the steadfast city of 
Sanaa with the missiles of treachery and meanness that have 
claimed the lives of many innocent citizens. 
  However, the gang of the vile killers will never escape the 
people's retribution. May God have mercy on the righteous 
martyrs, the victims of treachery. It is a true promise to the 
sons of our people to take revenge on the killers and their 
criminal, cowardly leader al-Bid and all those who advocate 
secession and apostasy.

  [Excerpts] Aden, Yemen, May 11 (AFP)--Southern Yemeni jets 
and artillery pounded rival northern forces Wednesday east of 
the strategic southern port city of Aden, a correspondent 
reported. 
  The heaviest fire was concentrated on the Zinjibar area, 
about 60 kilometres (36 miles) east of Aden, as well as Ja'ar 
and Bakis, where the northern al-'Amaliqah brigade is based. 
  Meanwhile, northern forces were also trying to open up a new 
front in the Bab al-Mandeb area, about 400 kilometres (248 
miles) west of Aden, said Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar, a 
southerner. 
  An AFP correspondent reported that southern planes made 
numerous sorties over Aden. The southern air force is 
considered stronger than that of the north. [passage omitted] 
  Some 12,000 northern troops are stationed in Abyan province, 
east of Aden, analysts say.

  [Text] Staff Brigadier Haytham Qasim Tahir, the defense 
minister, affirmed that the retreat of the forces of the 
al-Ahmar ruling gang and the heavy losses inflicted on them was 
a logical and natural result, because their soldiers are waging 
this war against their own will, and they do not realize for 
which goals they are fighting except defending the interests of 
the tyrant lackey family. That is why they are fighting with low 
morale and later they join their brothers in the broad popular 
base which defends the unity, democracy, and the convention 
document. 
  This was mentioned in the important press talk which was 
given by him [the defense minister] to SAWT AL-UMMAL in its 
issue tomorrow. He indicated that the number of casualties among 
the Armed Forces defending the unity and democracy is incredibly 
few. 
  He indicated to the reports by the mass media about tens of 
victims of children, elderlies and women, who were attacked by 
missiles and rockets in their houses as the result of random 
shelling of peaceful towns and villages and residential 
apartments by the al-Ahmar ruling gang. The defense minister 
added that the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] does not boast of 
victory in this war, which was forced on our people and homeland 
by the al-Ahmar gang in a desperate attempt to hold on to power 
and control the wealth of our people. He affirmed that the 
national base is broadening daily and our people are determined 
to continue to repel the gangs of this adventurous family until 
the great victory is achieved. 
  The defense minister added that the YSP had dealt with the 
merger of the Armed Forces with the sincere intention to build 
the Yemeni Armed Forces, which stabilize the unity. The defense 
minister affirmed that the YSP did not bother about the 
positioning of military units which were deployed from the 
southern part to the northern part and vice versa, on the eve of 
22 May 1990, because the party had the national responsibility 
towards the homeland which it hoped to share with the People's 
General Congress. 
  He added that the subsequent days and circumstances proved 
that the executive leadership of the al-Ahmar gang had deployed 
their forces in accordance with intentions to ignite war and 
control the southern governorates by force, which is not 
acceptable. The defence minister appreciated the heroes of the 
Armed Forces and the Yemeni people, who are defending the unity 
of the people and the homeland.

  [Text] Eyewitnesses report that large fires, the cause of 
which is still unknown, broke out today in the quarter where the 
house of Shaykh Abdullah Bin Husayn al-Ahmar, chairman of the 
Chamber of Deputies, chairman of the Yemeni Alliance for Reform, 
and principal paramount Shaykh of the Hashid clan, is situated 
in the Interior Ministry building in the (Hasabah) quarter in 
the capital, Sanaa. Foreign correspondents reported on 10 May 
that the atmosphere in Sanaa was extremely tense. They noticed 
military patrols in the streets of Sanaa investigating citizens 
to establish their identities. 
  Other reports from Sanaa indicate splits in the military 
leadership as a result of the battles currently being fought in 
the country, while many military leaders were dominated by 
restlessness when the promise made by the president that the 
fighting would end within three days proved to be wrong. 
Military sources in Sanaa have referred to the recent irregular 
military appointments made by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
such as that of 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi as defense minister. 
This angered the president's paternal cousin, Colonel 'Ali 
Muhsin al-Ahmar, who regards himself as the de facto commander 
of the Army and feels that he enjoys the confidence of the 
family, while there are yet others regarded by the military

  [Excerpt] Sanaa, May 12 (AFP)--Northern forces in Yemen's 
civil war claimed Wednesday to have captured a mechanised 
brigade belonging to the south as southern leader 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid demanded northern forces withdraw before a ceasefire. 
  A northern military statement published here said northern 
forces had captured all the tanks and artillery of the pro-south 
25th mechanised brigade based at Haraz. 
  An unspecified number of the 1,200 soldiers had surrendered 
to the northern side, according to the statement published by 
the SABA' news agency here. 
  Southern leaders told AFP Wednesday that the north was 
attempting to open up a new front in the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb 
region to the west of the main southern town of Aden. 
  A statement published in Sanaa said northern forces 
inflicted 
"heavy losses" on southern troops in the al-'Anad and al-Hutah 
areas 50 kilometres (30 miles) north of Aden. 
  The northerners were "moving towards their objectives" in 
the 
al- Dali' sector. 
  In the Abyan province, east of Aden, southern forces had 
attempted to launch a counter-offensive but had been "forced to 
beat a retreat," the statement said. 
  At Abyan, a southern spokesman said their forces were 
concentrating their attacks on northern pockets in the Zinjibar 
region, on the coast and in Ja'ar and Bakis to the east. 
  Al-Bid, stripped of the office of vice-president by the 
northern- dominated parliament last week, said a ceasefire was 
dependent on a withdrawal of northern forces from the southern 
part of the country. 
  "The return of forces to their positions (before the north 
and south were united in 1990) is an important condition for the 
end of fighting," al-Bid, looking relaxed and smiling, told 
reporters at his home overlooking Aden. 
  "There are no longer southern forces in the north after they 
were destroyed" by troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, al-Bid said. 
  He said the war had been "imposed by the dictator 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and the family" of parliamentary speaker Shaykh 
'Abdallah al- Ahmar. 
  "We did not start the war. It was forced on us. And we 
continue to resist the invasion forces. We will not allow the 
al-'Amaliqah (northern) forces to progress one inch towards 
Aden," he said. 
  Al-Bid said "to date there is no sign of a political 
dialogue 
or mediation," with Salih and ruled out a meeting with the 
northern leader. 
  "We sat together with Salih to agree on unity (in 1990) but 
after the blow he has struck we cannot sit around the same 
table," he said. 
  The civil war in Yemen has pitched the socialist south, led 
by al-Bid, against the conservative Islamic north, four years 
after the two were united. 
  Yemeni Muslim fundamentalists "are in league with 
fundamentalists abroad who are attempting to prevent the Arab 
nation from getting into the 21st century," al-Bid said 
Wednesday. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by "official military source" at the Defense </F>
Ministry in Sanaa --date not given] 
  [Text] With God's help and support, the heroes of our brave 
Armed Forces have continued their brave, heroic tasks in their 
confrontation against the rebellious secessionist forces, which 
are misled by the criminal and evil separatist elements in the 
leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], who are involved 
in the plot against the people, unity, democracy, and 
constitutional legitimacy. 
  Our Armed Forces in the southwest axis captured the 25th 
Mechanized Brigade, stationed in the (?Faz) garrison, and seized 
all its tanks, artillery, equipment, and vehicles. A number of 
this brigade's officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers 
surrendered to the ranks of Constitutional legitimacy who are 
protecting Yemeni unity. In the same axis, in the 
al-'Anad-(?al- Hawdah) sector, our Armed Forces inflicted on the 
forces hostile to legitimacy and Yemeni unity huge losses in 
equipment and weapons. In the al-Dali'-al-'Anad sector, the 
Armed Forces continued their advance accomplishing their tasks 
successfully. 
  In the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces affiliated with the 
separatist forces -- which are hostile to unity and democracy 
and which are devoted to serving the illegitimate desires of the 
members of the bloody gang in the YSP leadership -- sustained 
huge losses in equipment, weapons, and vehicles. These forces 
retreated to rear positions after failing to carry out desperate 
attacks. 
  Meanwhile, the heroes in the Armed Forces Air Defense in all 
axes confronted the air raids carried out by the aircraft of the 
forces of apostasy, which are hostile to the people and 
Constitutional legitimacy, forcing these planes to flee. This 
made the criminal secessionist forces resort to crazy methods, 
which reveal their grudge, hysteria, and death throes, by firing 
a number of missiles at peaceful populated cities and civilian 
facilities, including the firing of two Scud missiles at Sanaa 
early yesterday morning. One of these missiles fell in a big 
residential area. This shows the state of hysteria and 
cowardliness in which the igniters of the war are living as well 
as their realization of the fate they will face soon, God 
willing, now that their treacherous objectives of this war have 
been aborted. Unity has been entrenched through the blood and 
sacrifices of our valiant heroes in our Armed Forces and 
Security Forces and by their great heroism in embodying their 
loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, unity, and 
democracy. Unity has also been entrenched through the entire 
people's solidarity with their leadership and their righteous 
sons in the Armed Forces and Security Forces in the battle aimed 
at defending life and their great national and popular 
achievements, championing the loftiest values and pan-Arab and 
human principles of justice, and at making the rebels, the 
enemies of people, homeland, legitimacy, and Constitutional 
institutions taste the consequences of their acts and tyranny, 
God willing. 
  God's victory is imminent. 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If you 
will aid the cause of God, He will aid you and plant your feet 
firmly. [Koranic verse]

  Both sides appeared to be heading for a stalemate along the 
pre-unification border formerly dividing conservative North 
Yemen and the Marxist south. 
  Salih's southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid, sacked by the 
northern-dominated parliament last week, said a ceasefire 
depended on the withdrawal of northern forces from the south. 
  "The return of forces to their positions (before unification 
in May 1990) is an important condition for ending the fighting," 
al-Bid told reporters at his home overlooking Aden. 
  A simmering feud between Salih and al-Bid over political and 
economic reforms boiled over into all-out war a week ago.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, has met with the brother Interior Ministry leaders and 
officials in charge of security organizations in the Republic. 
They discussed a number of security issues and the role of the 
security agencies in bolstering security and providing peace of 
mind in society, especially in the current delicate 
circumstances experienced by our country as a result of the war 
fueled by the rebellious secessionist gang in the leadership of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  Speaking at the meeting, the brother chairman of the 
Presidential Council praised the security men's recent efforts 
to maintain security and citizens' lives and property. In his 
speech, the brother chairman reviewed the crimes of the 
rebellious secessionist elements in the YSP against the homeland 
and the people since the crisis began on 19 August 1993. He 
said those elements have dealt with the children of the homeland 
mercilessly and irresponsibly. He noted that the latest of 
these practices was last night's heinous crime in which the 
cowardly criminals indiscriminately fired a missile against 
innocent, secure citizens, striking one of Sanaa's densely 
populated districts, resulting in 53 [number as received] 
casualties. He said: This cowardly, treacherous act will not go 
unpunished. In war, it would be acceptable to hit military or 
strategic targets. But when peaceful citizens' homes and 
civilian targets are hit, verily this is a disgraceful, 
treacherous act and an odious crime that is contrary to all 
morals, norms, values, and laws. This crime is evidence of the 
state of complete bankruptcy and despair that has gripped that 
criminal secessionist clique in the YSP command. This clique 
has acted mercilessly towards its own members. How can it have 
mercy on the homeland and the people? 
  The brother chairman: I would have preferred that the 
elements of the al-Bid-led secessionist gang turn themselves in 
for trial. We will give them a fair trial. Let them choose 
whoever lawyers they want in order to preserve the lives of the 
remaining Armed Forces personnel under their control, as well as 
the innocent citizens. This is the required nationalist stand. 
We are not against the YSP. We are against the apostate 
secessionist elements in the YSP command. 
  The brother chairman added: I call on all officers, 
noncommissioned officers, and soldiers in the Armed and Security 
Forces who are under the control of the secessionist clique to 
reject orders in their camps and to pledge loyalty to unity and 
constitutional legitimacy. I am ready to issue instructions to 
the Defense Ministry to stop the process of confronting them to 
give those elements the chance to leave the Port of Aden for 
Djibouti or anywhere else. 
  This is better and more honorable than continuing a losing 
war and shedding more innocent blood. Those who are doing this 
now will pay a high price and will lose the people. The 
unionists in the Yemeni Socialist Party should clearly define 
their position on that criminal gang, rally around unity and 
Constitutional legitimacy, and reject the decisions of the 
secessionist gang that decided to launch the war, in order to 
curb chaos and the shedding of more Yemeni blood, to maintain 
public security, and to let their behavior set an example. I 
urge tribal chiefs, social figures, and all citizens to deal 
with local and internal organizations to maintain security in 
society. 
  It is time to end the problems of four years of security 
chaos and financial and administrative corruption and to start 
building a modern Yemeni state, a state of law and order, and to 
impose the state's prestige. It is not a Sanaa, Hadhramaut, 
Aden, or Abyan republic, but a Yemeni Republic, which we all 
accept. We take pride in its development within the framework 
of constant principles, namely, unity and the republican system 
based on our tolerant Islamic doctrine. 
  Salih urged the employees of the Interior Ministry and all 
security organizations to make every effort to maintain public 
security and punish those who cause chaos or harm. All these 
elements should be deterred, at a time when we highly appreciate 
the security mens' activity over the past days. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, Interior Minister Brigadier 
General Yahya al-Mutawakkil welcomed the brother president and 
said: We pledge to you that we will stand by you and by 
legitimacy against all those who have departed from legitimacy 
and against all acts violating security. Since the very 
beginning, we, in the Interior Ministry, have been in a state of 
alert to confront those who tamper with security and exploit the 
circumstances. The security men are standing in one rank along 
with their brothers in the Armed Forces, and feel that the 
security battle completes the true battle. We are responsible 
before you for citizens' security and safety. We promise you 
that we will continue to epitomize the spirit of unity and 
national responsibility represented by legitimacy. We beseech 
God to grant us success in our work and to allow our people to 
achieve victory and to continue construction and development. 
  The meeting was attended by Colonel (?Muhsin al-Muski), head 
of the general authority of meteorology and civil aviation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F>
Salah Salamah in Cairo on 11 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Salamah] Your Excellency Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Mr. Muhammad Salim Basindwah, you are now in Cairo. Today, you 
said that the fighting in Yemen between the northern and 
southern units in the Yemeni Army will end in one day or less. 
What is the latest information you have on the situation on the 
ground in Yemen? 
  [Basindwah] The latest information we have on the situation 
in Yemen is that the fighting is getting close to Aden and that 
the forces of Constitutional legitimacy are now in the Dar Sa'd 
area that is adjacent to the al-Shaykh Uthman quarter in Aden. 
  I would like to correct one point. The fighting is not 
between southern and northern forces. Forces born in the 
southern part of the homeland, as it used to be called in the 
past, are fighting under the banner of Constitutional 
legitimacy. It is fighting between the forces of Constitutional 
legitimacy and the forces of the rebel group under the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] that seeks to fragment unity. 
  [Salamah] Your excellency, disagreement in Yemen has taken 
on 
a hostile and vicious form between the leaders of the southern 
province and the central leadership in Sanaa. You have rejected 
Arab mediation. Have you determined on a military settlement of 
the issue? 
  [Basindwah] We do not reject any Arab good offices to stop 
the shedding of blood, on the conditions that Constitutional 
legitimacy is respected, that the Constitution is the judge, and 
that the forces controlled by the apostate and rebel gang 
holding sway over the YSP rejoin Constitutional legitimacy and 
obey the leadership of legitimate authority under President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and the 
supreme commander of the Armed forces. There are Arab good 
offices that we value and welcome, on the condition that these 
good offices take place on the basis of the conditions I have 
set before you. 
  [Salamah] Your excellency the minister: Those conditions, 
which have been set by the central command in the north, are 
deemed binding on officials in the southern region. In a 
practical sense, this removes any possibility of an 
understanding. Is there a possibility of returning to the 
negotiating table to settle the existing differences? 
  [Basindwah] Of course, you are aware that the crisis was 
fabricated nine months ago. Many concessions were offered under 
pressure to end the crisis. However, the side that fabricated 
the crisis, which is the YSP command, insisted on continuing the 
crisis endlessly. People suffered a great deal as a result of 
the crisis. The situation became unbearable. At last, when some 
apostate, rebellious, secessionist elements in the YSP command 
failed to achieve their objective of separation, they again 
resorted to military means. Thus, they started the fighting. 
We had to defend ourselves. We did not start the fighting. 
It was the YSP commanding gang rebelling against Constitutional 
legitimacy, law, and order that initiated combat and the use of 
the military card. 
  I would also like to explain to you on this occasion that 
Yemen is not two countries or two peoples. Yemen is one country 
and one people. This is seen in the fact that even under 
separation, when there was a state in the north and another in 
the south, we used to describe each state as a part. We did not 
use the term country or people, or describe any of the two 
parts. Hence, Yemen's unity, unlike the unity between Egypt and 
Syria, is a unity of the same people and of two parts of the 
same country. 
  [Salamah] Your excellency the minister: Aden sources accuse 
the leadership in Sanaa of being supported by Iraqi and Sudanese 
troops in the fighting? 
  [Basindwah] This is not uncharacteristic of the YSP command, 
which is used to lying and fabrication. This is seen in the 
fact that a YSP leader -- the former Aden governor, Salih 
Munassar al- Suhayli -- told brother officials in Egypt that a 
large number of Egyptian al-Jihad organization members had been 
detained. He asked the Egyptian leadership to ask the 
legitimate leadership in Sanaa to send him a clear order to 
extradite those members to the Egyptian consul in Aden. 
Afterward, Interior Minister Brigadier General Yahya Muhammad 
al-Mutawakkil sent an official memorandum to the then Aden 
governor, Salih Munassar al-Suhayli, ordering him to extradite 
the members of the Egyptian al-Jihad organization whom he 
claimed to have detained to the Egyptian consul in Aden. 
  The Egyptian consul in Aden took the memorandum to 
Brigadier General Salih al-Suhayli. It was later confirmed that 
Salih Munassar al-Suhayli lied. Proof of this is the fact that 
al-Suhayli did not hand anything to anyone and that no one from 
the Jihad organization was with him. 
  It is said that there are Iraqi and Sudanese elements 
fighting within the ranks of the forces of legitimacy. This is 
untrue. We defy the influential and rebelling elements in the 
YSP leadership to show one of these elements or to prove their 
allegations. 
  Influential and renegade elements in the YSP resort to, and 
circulate, these rumors in order to instigate fraternal and dear 
Arab states against both Sanaa and the legitimate leadership in 
the Republic of Yemen. 
  [Salamah] Your Excellency Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah: 
In the absence of deputies from the southern areas, the Yemeni 
House of Representatives in Sanaa took measures to expel and 
oust senior southern leaders. In your opinion, did the House, 
which included deputies from the northern areas, represent 
Constitutional legitimacy when it took these measures? 
  [Basindwah] Who told you that all the deputies present at 
the House meetings during which these decisions were made were 
from the northern governorates? There were deputies who 
represented constituencies in the northern governorates, and 
there were deputies belonging to the YSP itself ... 
  [Salamah, interrupting] Who participated in making these 
decisions? 
  [Basindwah] They participated in making these decisions. 
You can verify this. 
  [Salamah] Your Excellency the minister: You said Aden is 
currently besieged. Is there a decision to militarily storm 
Aden? 
  [Basindwah] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih fully cares for the safety 
of all citizens residing in Aden, the economic and commercial 
capital of the Republic of Yemen and the place that embraced the 
national movement. Thus, Salih does not plan to storm Aden. He 
would have the citizens in Aden chase the elements which want to 
inflict further destruction and havoc on Aden, exactly like what 
they did in the past. 
  [Salamah] Your Excellency the minister, the last question 
is: In light of the ongoing fighting and the aggravating 
political problems in Yemen, what, in your opinion, are the 
prospects available for you now to restore national unity and 
preserve Yemeni unity as a whole? 
  [Basindwah] I believe there are among those born in the 
southern governorates those who can represent these governorates 
in the authority. They enjoy respect and appreciation. There 
are unionist elements in the YSP that now must determine their 
position on their comrades who rebelled and violated unity and 
Constitutional legitimacy. These elements would enjoy respect, 
and a dialogue would be held with them, exactly as it was held 
with all of them in the past. 
  [Salamah] Thank you, Your Excellency Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah for these statements to Radio Monte 
Carlo. 
  [Basindwah] Thank you. I wish you success.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 May (INA)--Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah has stressed that the Yemeni people, with all their 
national factions and forces, are confronting the secessionist 
rebellion led by Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] members. In a 
statement to an INA correspondent in Cairo before heading for 
Amman, Basindwah said: What is taking place in Yemen is not a 
civil war as depicted by some people, but a confrontation 
against the remnants of secessionism and violators of the 
constitution and legitimacy. 
  Basindwah said: Now that the separatist cliques have 
continued with their agentry, fabrication of crises, and 
igniting the war, the Yemeni people and the constitutional 
government have decided to confront these cliques to restore 
security, stability, and legitimacy. He stressed that matters 
are proceeding in favor of legitimacy and the people, adding 
that there is no question that they will triumph. 
  The foreign minister said that the government and people, 
led 
by Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, appreciate Arab 
brothers' feelings and concern over unity. He added: However, 
what is taking place in Yemen is an internal matter. Fighting 
was imposed on us, so we have no choice but to defend law and 
unity in the wake of the crisis fabricated by the separatists 
over the past year. 
  Regarding the possibility of reaching a cease-fire and 
holding dialogue, Basindwah said: If these elements do not 
return to constitutional legitimacy and resort to law, and if 
the gangs do not abandon their dreams and return to the 
legitimacy represented by the Constitutional leadership under 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, we will continue to uproot them. 
  Asked about his current Arab tour, Basindwah noted that 
Yemen 
hopes that the Arab brothers will understand what is taking 
place as well as the crisis fabricated by the YSP leaders to 
strike at Yemeni unity. He stressed that some parties refer to 
Yemen as South and North for separatist objectives, adding that 
many members of the current government come from the South, such 
as the new defense minister, the commander of the Navy, 
fighters, and commanders. 
  Basindwah ridiculed the separatists' statements that Arab 
parties are helping the Yemeni Government in confronting the 
separatists. He said: We challenge them to prove this. It is 
not strange to see these rebellious apostate elements making 
such false statements at the instructions of foreign forces. 
  Asked about the nature of the Yemen's future political life, 
Basindwah said: Following the regrettable incidents, Yemen will 
enter a new phase of stability, democracy, prosperity, 
legitimacy, and collective participation in the government in 
accordance with the interests and Constitution of the Republic 
of Yemen.

<F P=106> [Statements by Acting Prime Minister Muhammad Sa'id </F>
al-'Attar at a news conference with correspondents at the Prime 
Minister's office in Sanaa on 11 May--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. First, I would like to welcome all of you. I am 
happy with this first meeting in my capacity as the head of the 
Council of Ministers. Also, since [words indistinct] I have not 
met with you often. Therefore, this is an opportunity [words 
indistinct] all of us. I will begin this news conference with 
an approximately 10- minute introductory statement. Afterward, 
I will take your questions. We want a dialogue to be 
established between ourselves and journalists. Statements are 
not enough. We hope this dialogue will provide a clear picture 
of what is really going on in Yemen. I do not want to start 
from the very beginning of the crisis, or the so-called Yemeni 
crisis. I believe all of you know a great deal about it. 
However, allow to me to say that the [word indistinct] crisis 
began many months ago, specifically [words indistinct] the last 
six-seven months. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to reiterate what all leaders in Sanaa have 
said. The crisis was started by members of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] Political Bureau. We distinguish between the YSP 
and its leadership, or some of its (?leaders). This is because 
[words indistinct] is rebellion against constitutional 
legitimacy. In view of this rebellion, and after the first 
battles took place, the Army of the Republic of Yemen had to 
play its role and perform its national duty. This Army has 
played its role. [sentence indistinct]. However, contrary to 
what has been [word indistinct] here and abroad, the battle is 
not between the north and south. This is untrue. This is 
because among the Yemeni Armed Forces fighting today in support 
of legitimacy and the constitution are many southern brigades. 
This statement is supported by the fact that the defense 
minister, who was appointed two days ago, is from the Abyan 
region. He is not the only one. There are many southerners 
among the Armed Forces. In fact, as you know, thousands, or at 
least hundreds, of our brother troops who are fighting against 
the official troops join us daily and fight against the other 
side. This is clear. You and the Information Ministry, God 
willing, should visit these areas to see for yourselves this 
[word indistinct]. 
  This is the point I wanted to [word indistinct]. Therefore, 
it is not a north-south battle, nor even a battle between the 
General People's Congress and the YSP. Rather, it is between 
the legislative and Constitutional authority on the one hand and 
the rebels on the other. Some elements of the (?political 
bureau rebelled) [words indistinct]. This is the situation 
[words indistinct]. 
  So, back to Arab mediation. When we were asked about Arab 
troops being sent to disengage the two armies, our response was 
that there are not two armies or two countries. Rather, there is 
one country and one constitutional authority, representing 
constitutional legitimacy versus rebels. [Words indistinct] 
discussing troops [words indistinct]. If we want so [word 
indistinct] this is being observed. I will give an example from 
Europe. In France, there are some rebels in Corsica. The 
French Government is fighting them, but there are no 
international troops disengaging the two sides. The same can be 
said of Ireland and many other states. If now or in the future 
something takes place against Egyptian authority [words 
indistinct] separation in Asyut or elsewhere, will we send 
troops to disengage them and the Egyptian government? Do we 
want to send disengagement troops between the Algerian 
Government and those who represent the opposition, for example? 
If it happens in the United States that Los Angeles, for 
example, clashes with the official government or security 
troops, will disengagement troops be sent there? I believe this 
is a wrong idea. 
  Therefore, we support dialogue. We are ready to accept and 
welcome all mediation, particularly by sisterly states. 
However, this is on condition that they distinguish between 
sending troops, and exchanging views and ideas and proposing 
solutions. The government is fully prepared to discuss them 
within the framework that has been approved by the entire Yemeni 
people, which is the constitution, unity, democracy--not only 
[word indistinct] democracy, but also political, economic, 
cultural, and information democracy. In this framework, we 
welcome all mediation -- strictly within this framework. 
  As for [words indistinct], a brother from the chief of staff 
command will brief you on the situation from a military point of 
view. I have a long experience in this field. As you perhaps 
know, I was an official during the events which were called the 
70-day siege in Yemen [words indistinct]. Then, I was the 
minister of economy [word indistinct] and adviser to brother 
[name indistinct], may God have mercy on his soul, who was a 
great citizen, a great nationalist, and a great struggler. We 
have some experience, but it is not part of my responsibility 
[words indistinct] to give details. However, I can say one 
thing. We hear international press reports talking about an 
advance here, a retreat there, and that the media [sentence 
incomplete as heard]. We want all our military statements in our 
media to be credible. We do not want to exaggerate. All 
figures [words indistinct] and the regions in which we are 
deployed, I hope will be visited by all correspondents. 
[sentence indistinct]. We are one people. As President 'Ali 
'Abdallah said [words indistinct), we differentiate between a 
rebellious clique from the YSP and the entire people, who are 
part of us and our (?blood). We are very sad that we have to 
kill each other. This is a crime [words indistinct] the 
brothers in the political leadership of the YSP. This is what I 
wanted to say. Now I will take your questions. Thank you.

it." Asked about the way out, he said: "The way out is to halt

the way to settle disputes, because it will bring nothing but 
destruction and tragedies for our people." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 11 May (MENA)--In a news conference today 
Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, Arab League assistant secretary 
general for political affairs, stated that the primary mission 
of the Arab League delegation, currently in Sanaa, is to deliver 
a message to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih from Arab 
League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. He explained 
that the message deals with ideas and views that might help end 
the fighting in the country and start a dialogue among the 
Yemeni leaders. 
  He added that the Arab League delegation to Yemen, headed by 
Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, Arab League assistant secretary 
general for military affairs, made an arduous trip from Cairo to 
Jeddah, overland to Najran and then on to Sanaa. This, he 
pointed out, illustrates the Arab League's efforts to halt the 
fighting, end the bloodshed, and preserve Yemeni unity. 
  He said the Arab League has made persistent efforts to solve 
the Yemeni crisis, the latest being an emergency Arab League 
Council meeting which issued a three-point resolution to follow 
up on the crisis. The first point stresses that the fighting 
will ruin the achievements that the Yemeni people made over many 
years and will cause suffering for future Yemeni generations. 
The second point calls for a dialogue that will maintain Yemeni 
national unity. The third point calls for keeping the Arab 
League emergency meeting in session until the crisis is resolved. 
  Ambassador 'Imran thanked Egypt for initiating the emergency 
meeting and the Saudi Government for welcoming the arrival of an 
Arab League delegation and facilitating its travel to Sanaa. 
  'Imran said the delegation is authorized by the Arab League 
secretary general and the Arab League Council to make all 
necessary contacts, basically with the Yemeni Government in 
Sanaa, to reach a cease-fire in the country. 
  He added that the delegation will not be restricted and will 
have full powers to decide which parties it will make contacts 
with in order to reach a cease-fire and arrange a dialogue. He 
said the delegation is in constant contact with the Arab League 
secretary general for consultation on any new developments. 
  Asked about the failure of a previous Arab League mission to 
Yemen, 'Imran noted that there are always chances of success or 
failure but the efforts must not stop. He said: We cannot 
watch fire ravaging part of the Arab homeland without 
intervening. 
  He asserted that the mission of the Arab League delegation 
is 
not limited to fact finding but will try to arrange a cease-fire 
and to persuade the Yemeni leaders to begin a dialogue. He 
pointed out that the Arab League is not drawing up a solution 
but is asking the Yemeni leaders to begin a dialogue and reach 
an agreement. 
  He continued: If the Pledge and Accord Document can serve 
this purpose, that is good, but if it needs to be amended, then 
the matter will be left to the Yemeni leaders. They must find a 
solution based on domestic circumstances. 
  Asked about the reported Yemeni rejection of Arab mediation, 
the Arab League secretary general for political affairs said the 
Arab League is directly responsible for pan-Arab security, this 
responsibility being a matter of destiny to it. He added that 
the Arab League Council, in issuing its recent resolution, 
expressed a unanimous view of the threats to pan-Arab security. 
  The Arab League secretary general for political affairs 
expressed hopes that the delegation will succeed in halting the 
fighting and maintaining Yemeni unity.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Sanaa Rejects 'Arafat's Mediation"] </F>
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Sanaa has rejected an 
offer of mediation made two days ago by the Palestinian 
leadership in an endeavor to stop the war in Yemen. Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid welcomed the Palestinian offer of 
mediation, which would have been carried out by Fatah Central 
Committee Member 'Abbas Zaki, who enjoys excellent relations 
with the Yemenis, especially in south Yemen where he worked as 
representative of the Palestinian revolution in Aden several 
years ago. 
  That is what Zaki himself said. He told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
that he would have left for Yemen had President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih accepted the mediation, but the Yemeni president's 
announcement three days ago rejecting any Arab or foreign 
mediation, on the grounds that what was happening in Yemen was 
an internal affair, prevented him from carrying out the mission 
entrusted to him by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat.

<F P=106> [Report by Sulayman Nimr and Muhammad 'Allam: "Sanaa Accepts </F>
Arab Mediation, With Conditions"] 
  [Excerpts] Riyadh, Sanaa, Aden, Cairo -- The war between 
Yemen's two armies turned yesterday into a war of positions, 
despite the statements issued by the two sides, which are both 
claiming advances. Independent sources say that the fighting is 
now taking place in Abyan Governorate and on the fringes of 
Lahij Governorate. Efforts to resolve the crisis have now moved 
to the political level as a result of the military deadlock, as 
Sanaa has for the first time openly announced its acceptance of 
Arab mediation, "provided it is based on respect for 
constitutional legitimacy." 
  Latest reports received from the Yemeni capital said that 
fierce fighting is taking place in al-'Anad, some 50 km from 
Aden. 
  In the framework of political moves, Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the Yemeni House of 
Representatives, and Development and Planning Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani arrived in Riyadh yesterday, while 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah went to Cairo. The 
Arab League has announced its willingness to send a delegation 
to Sanaa. 
  Al-Iryani told AL-HAYAH that his country is not turning down 
any Arab mediation to stop the ongoing fighting in Yemen. He 
said that "Sanaa is not turning down Arab mediation, but it 
rejects any military intervention or the dispatch of Arab 
disengagement forces." He pointed out that "an acceptable 
mediation must recognize existing constitutional legitimacy in 
Yemen" -- a reference to the necessity to recognize President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's leadership of unified Yemen. Asked 
whether the Yemeni leadership is willing to engage in a dialogue 
with the Yemeni Socialist Party leadership in south Yemen, Dr. 
al-Iryani said: "We are willing to engage in a dialogue with 
them, provided they recognize constitutional legitimacy, 
existing constitutional institutions, and a unified command for 
the Yemeni Army." 
  He pointed out that "the current problem lies in the 
existence of two commands for the Yemeni Army, hence two armies 
in one country." He said that "the ruling leadership in Yemen 
has no objection to an Arab mediation with the other party to 
the Yemeni crisis, but within the framework of recognizing the 
legitimacy of the current ruling executive authority, which was 
elected in accordance with constitutional foundations in the 
country." On the dismissal of Prime Minister Dr. Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, Dr. al-Iryani said that the prime minister 
has not been dismissed. He has been suspended in accordance 
with Article 111 of the Constitution. He pointed out that 
"dismissing the government or its head requires legislative 
measures in the House of Representatives, and the legislature, 
the House of Representatives, has -- as a result of current 
conditions -- authorized the executive authority to take 
appropriate measures to deter the separatists." 
  He reemphasized that the "legitimate and constitutional 
leadership in Sanaa is willing to engage in a dialogue with the 
other side and to make contacts with it. But we want that side 
-- before anything else -- to recognize the existence of a 
unified leadership for Yemen and the Yemeni Army." 
  He denied that his statement means a change in the position 
of the Yemeni leadership in Sanaa, as it -- through President 
'Ali Salih -- had turned down Arab mediation. He said that his 
government agreed to receive an Arab League delegation, "which 
is on its way to Sanaa" to hold talks with the legitimate and 
constitutional leadership. He pointed out that the rejection 
was of a mediation and dialogue based on the existence of two 
legitimate leaderships in the country. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the YSP Political 
Bureau, has said that referring the Yemeni crisis to the 
Security Council is now left to the states concerned and their 
assessment of the deteriorating situation and its threat to 
world security. He pointed out that "military operations have 
negated the belief that the crisis is an internal affair." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH in Cairo yesterday, al-Dali urged 
the Gulf states "to intervene to secure a cease-fire in Yemen," 
and the brothers in the north "to return to the negotiating 
table." He accused Arab states of sending elements to fight 
alongside northern forces. 
  Al-Dali, who, because of military operations, has been 
forced 
to stay in Cairo, welcomed the call by President Mubarak and his 
Yemeni opposite number, Salih, to halt haphazard attacks on 
innocent civilians. He stated that the YSP will refer the 
matter to international and human rights organizations. He said 
that "the YSP has informed Arab states of the attacks on 
innocent civilians, urging their leaders to intervene." He 
added that "northern forces have shelled villages and civilians 
in al-Dali' area with Howitzers." He stressed that "the YSP 
will not keep silent. It will refer the matter to the 
international community and international human rights 
organizations." 
  Al-Dali urged the brothers in the north "to stop the 
bloodshed and return to the negotiating table." He also urged 
Arab and Gulf states to play a role in ending the crisis. He 
said: "As the fighting is still continuing, mediation has not 
been overtaken by events. The Gulf states still have a role to 
play." He stressed that "with the breakout of fighting, the 
issue is no longer an internal affair." Foreign influences on 
military operations "negate the belief that the crisis is purely 
a Yemeni affair." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of </F>
the Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party, YSP, by 
Cairo radio correspondent Siham al-Buluk, place and date not 
given; from "The Talking Newspaper" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Buluk] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] Political Bureau member, secretary of the 
YSP's Political and Foreign Relations Department, and envoy of 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, we welcome you. 
  [Al-Dali] Thank you. 
  [Al-Buluk] Doctor, Yemen has accepted Arab mediation. We 
know that an Arab League delegation has left for Yemen, seeking 
to end this conflict which has pained all the Arabs. How much 
can this mediation influence the crisis? 
  [Al-Dali] Doubtless the Arab League's mediation and the 
arrival of an Arab League delegation is joyful news to us. We 
formerly asked the Arab League and its secretary general, Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al- Majid for their good offices to end the crisis. 
I believe that the arrival of an Arab League delegation is a 
favorable sign that the other side is willing to accept the 
League's mediation in this crushing ordeal and continuing 
attrition on our good land, Yemen. 
  [Al-Buluk] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, when people heard that 
Yemen was rejecting Arab mediation, it created widespread 
frustration and raised questions about the Arab League's role. 
However, when the mediation was accepted, this provided proof of 
the League's strength and influential role. 
  [Al-Dali] This is true. We of the YSP, including Secretary 
General 'Ali Salim al-Bid, expressed a willingness to accept the 
Arab initiative right from the start. Regrettably the other 
side, the people in Sanaa, rejected this mediation and hoped to 
settle the issue militarily. It appears, however, that their 
military option has run into a dead end. We are now in the 
second week of fighting without any sign of their professed 
ability to settle the issue militarily. 
  [Al-Buluk] We must remember it is a conflict among brothers. 
  [Al-Dali] Yes, yes, but remember that we are actually 
fighting each other. It is impractical to deny this. We are 
two sides fighting each other. We accepted mediation and a 
cease-fire, not out of fear but to spare Yemeni lives. The other 
side's subsequent agreement to receive an Arab League delegation 
is a good sign. We hope that the meeting between the Arab 
League delegation and the officials in Sanaa will achieve good 
results. 
  [Al-Buluk] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, some countries are 
being accused of being behind what is happening in Yemen. It is 
said that these countries are fanning the fire of the civil war. 
  [Al-Dali] Our actions are not in a vacuum, nor are they 
based 
on false accusations. What actually happened is that among the 
captured crew members of downed military aircraft belonging to 
the north and the prisoners taken in Abyan we found nationals of 
other Arab countries. One of these prisoners is an officer from 
another Arab country. 
  [Al-Buluk] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz, 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the YSP 
have urged dialogue as a way to end the crisis. In your 
opinion, how can a dialogue be carried out now that war has 
erupted? 
  [Al-Dali] War does not preclude the principle of dialogue. 
On the contrary, you begin a dialogue to end a war. For this 
reason, despite the bitterness we feel, the bloodshed, and the 
arrogant intransigence of the brothers in Sanaa, we are willing 
to have a dialogue. Actually we fought each other in 1972 and 
1979 but the current war is more ferocious. 
  [Al-Buluk] Especially as Yemen has been united since 1990. 
  [Al-Dali] Yes, this war is fiercer and bloodier. 
Nevertheless we are ready to sit down and negotiate. 
  [Al-Buluk] Do you think that the dialogue could take place 
in an Arab land other than Yemen? 
  [Al-Dali] I believe that this could happen. Under the 
current circumstances, it is impossible to meet on Yemeni soil. 
But it could be possible to meet in Yemen when circumstances 
change. 
  [Al-Buluk] What is the current situation in Yemen now that 
the war has destroyed almost everything? Can you comment on the 
ongoing events? 
  [Al-Dali] It's a tragedy, a big tragedy. It's a big tragedy 
that will have a grave impact on the next generation. Instead 
of presenting a united modern Yemen, a Yemen of law and order, a 
Yemen of stability and democracy to our next generation, we are 
passing on a Yemen ruled by terrorism, governed by the idea of 
settling matters through military means, governed by bloodshed 
and killing, and governed by a desire to annihilate the other 
side. This is very regrettable. 
  [Al-Buluk] No doubt you know that President Husni Mubarak 
made several appeals to the brothers to cease fighting. How do 
you view the Egyptian mediation in the Yemeni crisis? 
  [Al-Dali] The Egyptian mediation, particularly the mediation 
of His Excellency President Husni Mubarak, has had a positive 
effect and has been welcomed by every Yemeni. We rely heavily 
on the Egyptian role and the mediation of His Excellency 
President Husni Mubarak. We wish this mediation success. We 
and the YSP will give every possible support to this mediation 
and the Egyptian role. 
  [A-Buluk] There is a question asked by every Egyptian 
citizen 
and every Arab citizen: Why did this happen in Yemen? 
  [Al-Dali] Simply and generally speaking because the old 
power 
structure wants to maintain its position and old regime and does 
not want to give a chance to the new generation. The brothers 
in Sanaa refused to implement the first article in the Pledge 
and Accord Document, which calls for the arrest of those 
involved in the assassination of YSP leaders. This led to the 
failure of implementing the document. 
  [Al-Buluk interrupting] This document was signed in Jordan 
in 
February 1994. 
  [Al-Dali] Yes. The brothers in Sanaa regrettably 
miscalculated by liquidating the South Yemeni brigades. It is 
regrettable to talk about a southern army and a northern army. 
But in fact the two armies did not unite. They started to 
liquidate the [southern] brigades that were deployed in the 
north with the aim of weakening the army of the south so that it 
could be easily liquidated in an advance toward Aden. It is the 
same idea and (?impotent) mentality [words indistinct]. 
  [Al-Buluk] Don't you think that the four years that preceded 
unity were enough to resolve the differences? 
  [Al-Dali] We tried the impossible in order to end the 
problems. 
  [Al-Buluk] We are broadcasting this dialogue and this is 
your 
personal viewpoint. We hope that the war in fraternal Yemen 
will end and that Yemen will again be as happy as it was. 
  [Al-Dali] This is not my personal viewpoint. Rather it is 
the YSP viewpoint.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, member of the </F>
People's General Congress, minister of planning and development, 
and former prime minister, in Riyadh, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in 
Cairo, date not given; on the "Dialogue from Afar" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Welcome to our program. 
  [Al-Iryani] Thank you. 
  [Al-Jundi] Concerning the conditions in Yemen and the fierce 
clashes between northern and southern forces, without pointing 
the blame at anyone, how can we contain the situation? 
  [Al-Iryani] I assure you that the northern forces are not 
alone. Several southern brigades are fighting alongside the 
northern forces. Other southern brigades have declared their 
loyalty to the lawful government. The situation will be 
contained once everyone shows respect for the Constitution and 
the lawful government and once the Armed Forces obey the orders 
of the state and their supreme commander. 
  [Al-Jundi] Some people say that weapons will not achieve a 
solution and that a political settlement must be brokered. 
  [Al-Iryani] Of course, all wars end with a political 
solution, regardless of their outcome. We welcome any political 
solution in the context of Yemeni unity and constitutional 
legitimacy. The Armed Forces should follow the orders of the 
state, not those of a party or an insurgent wing of a party. 
  [Al-Jundi] Concerning a political settlement, do you think 
that the Yemeni Presidential Council's rejection of any 
mediation has helped a political solution? 
  [Al-Iryani] I think this is a distortion. The Presidential 
Council has not rejected mediation. What it rejected was the 
internationalization of the crisis, its transformation into an 
international issue, and the dispatch of Arab or international 
troops to Yemen to separate the fighters. This is what the 
president told the House of Representatives. Some people 
twisted these words to make it seem as if he was rejecting 
mediation. What we reject is the internationalization of the 
conflict and its transformation from a conflict between a 
legitimate government and an insurgent group into a conflict 
between two states. This is unacceptable for us. It would be 
so in any other Arab or non-Arab country. 
  [Al-Jundi] Since we are discussing mediation, yesterday, 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah visited Egypt. And 
you are currently in Saudi Arabia together with 'Abdallah 
al-Ahmar, speaker of the House of Representatives. Are these 
visits linked with Egyptian and Saudi mediation? 
  [Al-Iryani] Two Arab League envoys are about to go to Jizan 
and Sanaa. As long as there is Arab League mediation, I think 
that most Arab countries would see this effort as sufficient.

<F P=106> [Reports by Salwa al-Ustuwani in Damascus and AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT bureau in Amman: "Restructuring of the Northern and 
Southern Commands Paves the Way for a New Phase in the Yemeni 
War"] 
  [Excerpts] According to Yemeni military sources, battles 
raged yesterday in the town of Zinjibar and extended to 
al-Bayda' Governorate in the north in the areas of al-Kawd and 
al-'Urqub and all the way to Mukayris. It seems that the 
northern al-'Amaliqah forces deployed there are drawning their 
last breath. The northern command had pinned great hopes on them 
for victory and for the occupation of Aden, and they were 
considered the pincers in the area to the north of Aden. 
  As regards the other forces which have been trying to 
besiege 
Aden from the north and the west in the 
Ta'izz-al-Rahidah-Mawiyah axis, they have withdrawn from the 
borders and from the areas they had occupied to the north of 
Ta'izz Governorate. [passage omitted] 
  In the course of the re-formation of the southern command, 
new appointments have been made in the various sectors as 
follows: 
  1. The eastern front (the governorates of Shabwah and 
Hadramaut): The operations there are supervised by Salih 
Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, former oil and mineral resources minister 
and chief of staff in the south. 
  2. The Abyan-al-Bayda' front is under the command of Abyan 
Governor Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad. 
  3. The Kirsh front is under the command of Colonel Qasim 
Bin-Yahya. 
  4. The Maqtabah front is under the command of Salih 'Ubayd 
Ahmad, former deputy prime minister who was defense minister 
before the unity. 
  5. The Ta'izz and Ibb brigades are under the command of 
Housing and Planning Minister Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah (Muhsin) 
and Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar (both members of the 
Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]), and 
Sultan al-Sami'i, the formerly independent deputy. 
  As regards the northern command, it has been formed as 
follows: 
  1. Ahmad Musa'id Husayn (member of the General Committee -- 
the Political Bureau -- of the General People's Congress [GPC]): 
Command of the Shabwah front. 
  2. 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, the new defense minister, and 
Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Husayni: Al-Bayda' command. 
  All three of them [as published] are former south Yemeni 
President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad's men. 
  3. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Muhammad Salim Basindwah, 
Ahmad Faraj, and 'Abdallah al-Qadi: Ta'izz command. 
  4. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani and a group of central areas 
officers: Ibb command. 
  5. (Central Security Commander) Muhammad 'Abdallah Salih, 
(Air Force Commander) 'Ali Salih al-Ahmar, (1st Armored Division 
Commander) 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, and (Information Minister) 
Hasan al-Lawzi: Sanaa area command. The aim is to purge it of 
the political parties and others who sympathize with the YSP. 
  6. 'Abd-al-Rahman Muhammad 'Ali 'Uthman, 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-zayn, and other leadership and staff members: Command of 
al-Hudaydah front. 
  Meanwhile, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has obtained some information 
about the arrest of a group of Sudanese and Iraqis in Aden and 
the arrest of 60 members of the extremist Afghan Jihad members 
in al-Dali'. There is information confirming that Eritrea has 
admitted into its airports a group of northern civilian planes 
which were taken to Asmara Airport out of fear that they might 
have been a target of attack at the airports of Ta'izz, Sanaa, 
and al-Hudaydah. 
  Although YSP sources have refused to confirm that Eritrean 
airports were used in the Yemeni war, some reports say that the 
southerners bombed Asmara airport after discovering that 
northern military aircraft had taken off from there. 
  The reports add that the north paid Eritrean President 
Isaias 
Afewerki $20 million for allowing the planes into his country's 
airport. 
  Sources close to the Yemeni Defense Ministry have told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the southern 'Abbud Brigade, in 
cooperation with the public in al-Dali' Directorate in the Lahij 
Governorate, successfully confronted the attack launched by 
northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
consisting of al-Hamzah Brigade reinforced by selected 
Republican Guard forces. The Defense Ministry in Aden said the 
result was a "crushing" defeat for the northern forces which had 
to retreat. 
  The sources said that the 'Abbud Brigade's forces, which are 
under the command of Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General 
Haytham Qasim Tahir, captured 15 tanks and destroyed 10 tanks 
and a number of vehicles and troop carriers, but the Defense 
Ministry did not give the human losses on both sides. 
  Sanaa has not denied that report to close politicians and 
reporters, who are finding it difficult to contact the outside 
world and who see Sanaa's silence about these battles of the 
past two days as an indication that the results were not in its 
favor. 
  Sources of the Yemeni Defense Ministry in the south said 
that 
four of Sanaa's Russian-made aircraft were shot down as they 
attacked civilian targets in Aden. Two of the pilots were 
captured. One of them is an Egyptian Islamic extremist and the 
other an Iraqi from the Iraqi Air Force. The other two were 
killed when their two aircraft exploded in mid-air. 
  The sources attribute the use of Iraqi pilots in the Yemeni 
war to the weakness of north Yemeni pilots and the warm 
relations between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn. Before the outbreak of battles, 
political and press sources said that a number of Iraqi military 
experts had arrived in Sanaa. [passage omitted] 
  In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Damascus, 
Yemeni military sources said that the planes which bombed Aden 
were Yemeni planes which took off from military airfields in 
Eritrea and were flown by Iraqi pilots. It seems that Iraq 
entered the battle through Eritrea after the latter was paid 
large sums of money. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, the chairman of the board of 
the secretariat of the Central Committee of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP], emphasized that those who ran away from 
implementing the pledge and accord document about which they 
used to talk a big mouth talk are the ones who plunged Yemen 
into civil infighting and who set plans for a brutal crime, the 
effect of which will not end for generations to come. 
  He clarified in an interview with the Middle East satellite 
television channel, MBC, that the war imposed on the Yemeni 
people has levelled the gunpowder, the bullets, and the shells 
to the heart of the unity and that the unity has been stabbed in 
the back. Pointing to those who committed this brutal crime, he 
said that this brutal crime did not only lead to the killing of 
the citizens in the peaceful villages and cities but it also 
directed a stab against the Yemeni people and to its history and 
future. He said: In this critical situation I call upon ... if 
we want to preserve something for the future, it is in the 
interests of Yemen that people are pledged to a logic rather 
than the logic of war. [sentence as heard] As for some, to put 
the invasion or the manipulation is the impossible which cannot 
be done. [sentence as heard] Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man reiterated 
that he that received reports from the war- mongers must know 
that they are [word indistinct]. He expressed satisfaction 
about the good intermediation efforts and said in this 
connection: Those who reject these intermediation under the 
illusion of achieving a military victory must wake up from their 
illusions, which I am afraid will hit them in their strongholds. 
  [Al-Jundi] What is the purpose of your visit to Riyadh? 
  [Al-Iryani] To discuss bilateral ties and explain the 
situation in Yemen. 
  [Al-Jundi] Reports say that you personally were behind the 
failure of the meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Salalah in Oman. You 
reportedly said that the southerners offered proposals that 
contradict Yemeni unity. 
  [Al-Iryani] Yes. This remains my opinion. I believe in it. 
  [Al-Jundi] Can we say that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
as 
chairman of the Presidential Council, can issue a cease-fire 
order to protect Yemeni unity and, above all, Yemeni blood? 
  [Al-Iryani] If the Armed Forces obey the authority of the 
state and the orders of the supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, then I am sure he will. 
  [Al-Jundi] The Presidential Council dismissed Prime Minister 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and the defense minister, while the 
House of Representatives dismissed Presidential Council Vice 
Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Al-'Attas told the Voice of the 
Arabs that the decisions were illegitimate and that the House of 
Representatives and the Presidential Council had no right to 
carry out such dismissals. 
  [Al-Iryani] Concerning the prime minister, the defense 
minister, and the oil minister, they were dismissed on the basis 
of a clear constitutional provision, namely, Article 111. The 
House of Representatives did not withdraw confidence from 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, but from those who support secession and work 
against Yemeni unity. 
  [Al-Jundi] Through your current contacts, is there a glimmer 
of hope for a settlement and calm in Yemen or will the war 
continue? 
  [Al-Iryani] You cannot lose hope. I believe the fighting 
will not continue long, but that sense and reason will prevail. 
  [Al-Jundi] Thank you. 
  [Al-Iryani] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim al-Wazir, secretary general of the </F>
Yemeni Islamic Unification and Action Movement, by Muna Yasin; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Yasin] The Yemeni crisis did 
not start with the recent events. What are the real reasons for 
the crisis? 
  [Al-Wazir] The main reason is the financial and 
administrative chaos, which began before unity and has continued 
to aggravate since. There is indiscipline in the expenditure of 
public funds, and all departments are in disarray. The economic 
situation is in extremely bad shape. In addition, there is no 
interest in work, and all parties are pursuing unsound policies. 
Moreover, the political leadership has failed to make officials 
abide by the law and work rules and pay attention to public 
interest, so it has reached the point that personal interests 
guide the officials. Everyone takes care of his personal 
interests and ignores the interests of the homeland. 
  [Yasin] There are people who speak of other reasons. They 
say that the political leader give high military posts to their 
relatives and fellow tribesmen. 
  [Al-Wazir] This is also part of the disorder that prevails 
in 
all civilian and military departments. 
  [Yasin] Is petroleum one of the reasons for the crisis, 
because every party wants to get that revenue and because they 
have failed to distribute it to the two parts of the country? 
  [Al-Wazir] This is totally untrue. The unhealthy 
malpractices are the main reason. The state's funds are treated 
as funds that belong to no one. 
  [Yasin] Certain individuals hint that regional and 
international circles are playing a role in the incidents and in 
influencing the fate of unity. 
  [Al-Wazir] I do not believe this is this case. In fact, if 
there is any foreign plotting, the influential rival Yemeni 
factions gave them the opportunity. 
  [Yasin] How then do you explain Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al- 
Bid's tour of the Gulf countries after the signing of the Pledge 
and Accord Document, a tour which he made without consulting 
with the Yemeni president? 
  [Al-Wazir] The situation was bad in Yemen, and the vice 
president says his tour was designed to improve Yemen's ties 
with neighboring countries. Prior consultation was not possible 
at the time because differences had not yet been settled. 
  [Yasin] Do you believe that this tour was normal behavior 
since it came directly after the signing of the Document? 
  [Al-Wazir] The vice president has given his justifications, 
which show concern for Yemen's ties with its neighbors. 
  [Yasin] Mystery surrounds the U.S. role as a mediator in the 
Yemeni crisis and also Washington's position on Yemeni unity. 
How do you view this role? 
  [Al-Wazir] Many people say that the United States is not 
opposed to Yemen's unity because it wants stability in Yemen. 
They say it wants this to promote stability and quiet in the 
region as a whole, to guarantee the continued flow of oil and 
because Yemen can be used as an alternative oil shipping point 
if problems recur in the Gulf. 
  [Yasin] Certain parties propose a confederation as an 
alternative to a complete merger and as a way out of the crisis. 
What do you think? 
  [Al-Wazir] This issue takes us back to the question of 
Yemeni 
society and whether unity is feasible for it. I maintain that 
there is no society where unity is more feasible as for the 
Yemenis. This society does not have the problem of any 
minorities, whether religious, ethnic, or linguistic. However, 
historical experience has shown that no one area can rule the 
others and no one individual can dominate all others. In other 
words, when there is a central government, fragmentation and 
secession occur. Retaining local rule in certain aspects would 
guarantee the continuation and success of unity. Therefore, 
local elections, for example, are considered to be an excellent 
thing by the Yemeni president, who approved them; all that 
remains is to implement them. But in my view, local elections 
would bolster unity; and this does not mean federalism. 
  [Yasin] This clause is outlined in the Pledge and Accord 
Document, but it was not implemented. 
  [Al-Wazir] It is funny that every party claims it supports 
the Document and accuses the other party of refusing to 
implement it. Only one part of the Document has not been 
implemented. I believe that the Yemeni president is capable, 
understanding, and flexible. If he wants to end the crisis he 
can do so, as he has the finesse and flexibility. By using his 
strong position he can steer things toward implementation of the 
Document. 
  [Yasin] But the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] is asking for 
guarantees before implementing the Document. What are these 
guarantees and what is the possibility of providing them? 
  [Al-Wazir] The YSP is demanding the implementation of 
specific clauses in the Document, as this would insure the 
return of Vice President al-Bid to Sanaa. The required 
guarantees are the implementation of the initial clauses 
relating to security in order to make Sanaa secure for residence. 
  [Yasin] The concern over security is linked to the 
assassinations of dozens of YSP members. Why are those 
responsible for the assassinations not punished? 
  [Al-Wazir] Ask those who refuse to investigate these crimes. 
  [Yasin] But you, as a Yemeni who follow events, may have an 
idea of the reason for this refusal, especially since there have 
been 156 assassinations. 
  [Al-Wazir] I believe that establishing security is very 
important to promoting the democratic process, which can only 
thrive in an atmosphere of security and stability. Dialogue, 
unlike violence, provides a chance for understanding. If it is 
difficult to implement the initial clause of the Document--that 
is, handing over those accused of the assassinations--the 
parties can start by implementing the other clauses of the 
Document and leave the first clause for the future. I propose 
that the parties start by implementing local rule and put off 
the clause on assassinations, which is difficult. 
  [Yasin] Why is it difficult? 
  [Al-Wazir] Because they have not started to implement it, 
which indicates that it is difficult. 
  [Yasin] I would like to ask about the other political forces 
in Yemen, particularly the al-Islah Party, the third partner in 
the government. 
  [Al-Wazir] The al-Islah Party is a prominent party and is 
trying to contain the crisis. However, the efforts of all 
parties should focus on implementing the Pledge and Accord 
Document, because it is the key to solving problems and 
achieving social justice, which is absent in Yemen. Yemen is 
now divided into an abject poor class and an unfairly rich one. 
Other problems are rife in Yemen, like the lack of security and 
deterioration of education. Moreover, the media is 
concentrating on useless aims. There are other problems that 
the al-Islah Party, the General People's Congress, and the YSP 
should resolve; and they should revive the principles and goals 
for which blood was shed to establish the state of Yemen. If 
they fail to do this, the long struggle would be in vain. 
  [Yasin] What about your party? 
  [Al-Wazir] The Islamic Unification and Action Party, as is 
clear from the name, is an Islamic party based on monotheism and 
it acts to establish a state on the basis of true Islam. The 
ideology of the party is that there is no contradiction between 
traditionalism and modernism. We call for coping with the age 
while not disavowing tradition and heritage of our predecessors. 
The party also calls for Arab and Islamic unity. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with former South Yemen President 'Ali Nasir </F>
Muhammad by Salwa al-Ustuwani in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Ustuwani] Were there signs pointing to 
what is happening now, signs which the various parties failed to 
deal with before the situation deteriorated? 
  [Muhammad] I had warned from the beginning that unless the 
Yemeni institutions (Presidential Council, Cabinet, and House of 
Representatives) convened, the Pledge and Accord Document 
implemented, and the problems which appeared from time to time 
contained, the alternative would be a power vacuum, anarchy, 
accusations, explosions, and war. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Missiles entered the arsenal of the South 
Yemeni forces when you were president, when you received them 
from the Soviet Union. Did it never occur to you that they 
might be used in some wars? 
  [Muhammad] I remember that after signing the agreement to 
purchase that weapon, Brezhnev told me that "this is a lethal 
and dangerous weapon and should only be used to threaten and 
intimidate, not to be fired." We saw it as an element of 
Yemen's strength against any foreign threat. We never used it 
in any of our past battles because we wanted stability for 
Yemen, the region, and our neighbors. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] What, in your view, should be done to end this 
grinding war? 
  [Muhammad] I am in favor of dialogue and I will not change 
my position even though that may not be in harmony with what is 
going on now or its consequences; but that is my position and 
sole responsibility. I call on them to resort to dialogue to 
resolve the crisis despite the fact that there have been 
considerable losses and clashes. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] The Arab League had proposed sending Arab 
forces. Are you in favor of such a solution and of Arab League 
intervention, bearing in mind that President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih rejected that? 
  [Muhammad] I support dialogue and the efforts being made by 
the Arab League and some Arab and friendly states to contain the 
crisis, but that, in my view, does not justify sending Arab 
forces to Yemen because the crisis is a Yemeni crisis and the 
solution must be a Yemeni solution. I am against partition and 
division in this case. The Arab efforts cannot succeed unless 
all parties respond, which is not what we are seeing now. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] How do you feel about foreign military 
intervention? 
  [Muhammad] As a matter of principle I am against the 
dispatch of any Arab or foreign forces. I reject that. Somalia 
is maybe an example of the failure of that to solve the problem. 
This is a Yemeni problem and it is up to the Yemenis to define 
it and to solve it. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] There are those who claim that neighboring 
states such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are behind the crisis and 
that they have provided aid for the south. What do you think? 
  [Muhammad] We should not apportion blame haphazardly or hold 
the brothers in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, or other foreign 
powers, responsible in any way because the problem is an 
internal Yemeni problem and the conflict an internal conflict, 
and the solution must be a Yemeni solution. We should not blame 
fraternal or friendly states for our own mistakes and failure in 
Yemen. The brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other 
Gulf states have made statements reaffirming their interest in 
Yemen's stability, and we have felt these sentiments from them. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] In your view, what role can the United 
States play to contain the crisis? 
  [Muhammad] We have, from the beginning, welcomed the 
positive U.S. role in containing the crisis. The U.S. 
initiative emphasized Yemeni unity, democracy, modernization, 
and stability. We saw these proposals and initiative as a 
special stance by Washington toward the Yemeni people. 
Washington realizes that stability in Yemen means stability in 
the region. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Are you in favor of raising the issue at the 
Security Council? 
  [Muhammad] I do not believe that is necessary. What has the 
Security Council got to do with it, if these are internal 
differences? We have rejected Arab military intervention, so 
are we to accept foreign solutions? This is an internal matter 
and we do not allow intervention in it. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Are you holding any consultations or contacts 
with the Yemeni parties? 
  [Muhammad] There have been contacts between me and the 
Yemeni president and vice president, and Salim Salih Muhammad, 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] assistant secretary general who 
is now in London, and other political figures in Yemen and 
abroad such as Brigadier General Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib. 
In all these contacts I emphasized -- and still do -- that the 
crisis must be contained and resolved peacefully and that the 
army and people of Yemen must be saved because anything else 
would weaken Yemen and its standing in the world. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] What about your own personal initiative for 
the settlement of the Yemeni crisis? 
  [Muhammad] I am now making contacts with the aim of finding 
a way to halt what is happening now. The Yemeni people are 
always my concern because they are suffering for no fault of 
their own. I want peace and security for the Yemeni people. I 
had previously made an initiative, and last month I submitted 
another initiative to the political leadership -- but they did 
not respond to it, nor did they respond to the other Arab 
initiatives made by our brothers and friends. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Can you tell us about your second initiative, 
concerning which nothing has been published? 
  [Muhammad] It is a practical program for the next phase. It 
would not be beneficial to divulge its details now. My role is 
not one of mediator but of someone who cares about national 
unity, Yemeni unity, and sparing Yemen the dangers of war, 
destruction, and partition. It is not a role in pursuit of 
personal gain or interest, nor of achieving personal political 
objectives. At any rate, we are awaiting what happens next. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] So, you are not at present contemplating 
returning to Yemen to help stop the deterioration? 
  [Muhammad] Quite the contrary. I am willing to go to Yemen 
if the general interest requires it and if the leadership is 
willing to respond to such an initiative. I am prepared to 
sacrifice for Yemen and for the future and security of Yemen, 
whatever the consequences. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Ustuwani] It has been claimed that forces loyal to you 
have now joined the military battles on the side of the northern 
forces to topple the Aden [leaders]. Is that true? 
  [Muhammad] I have instructed the forces and people loyal to 
me to put Yemen's unity above all other considerations. They 
are fighting for that now. Wherever my forces are, they are a 
part of the Yemeni forces working for Yemen's future...and I am 
in contact with them and with all the Arab brothers and friends. 
We await the settlement of the situation and the restoration of 
calm for the Yemen people, but there are still fears about the 
possible consequences of victory by either side.

  [Text] An authoritative source of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] Political Bureau has stated the following to Yemeni 
news agency SABA: 
  At a time when the regionalist and separatist forces of 
Sanaa 
are continuing the war against the people and unity with the 
flagrant and shameless help of foreign forces, they are still 
refusing to listen to the appeals of popular and political 
forces in the homeland, as well as the appeals of Arab brothers 
and friends to stop this ugly and destructive war. 
  The appeal, issued by the national bloc of opposition on 9 
May on halting the war, is one of the nationalist appeals which 
condemns the choice of war which has been imposed upon the 
homeland. 
  The people and the YSP, which has condemned the war from its 
outset on 27 April, reiterates its support for the appeal made 
by the national opposition bloc, proceeding from its antiwar 
stance and its defense for the unity and for the Pledge and 
Concord Accord. 
  The YSP appeals to the political and popular forces to 
condemn the war and the warmongers, who have been refusing to 
spare the blood of Yemenis, and to condemn the continuity of the 
war and the fighting between sons of the same country. 
  The YSP and the armed forces' response to unity and 
democracy, as well as the appeals to stop the war, falls within 
the framework of our stance, which has been rejecting and 
condemning the military option. [Words indistinct] on the 
crimes which are being committed by the war criminals against 
citizens, the armed forces, and the country's unity and future. 
  It will not be possible for those people to realize their 
miserable illusions. The heroic resistance of the people, with 
all its social forces, together with the armed forces, which 
have been defending unity and democracy, has thwarted and will 
thwart their illusions, which has sunk Yemen deep in this dirty 
war. Furthermore, it will not be possible for them to wash their 
hands of their crimes through their (?dirty interpretation). 
  In addition, their use of foreign forces in full view of the 
world has proved their bankruptcy as well as their defeat in 
front of the steadfast heroes of unity and the martyrs of the 
homeland.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] The current aggression by the al-Ahmar gang on the 
armed forces of unity and democracy has been dealt with by the 
local newspapers. SAWT AL-UMMAL newspaper in its issue affirmed 
that the criminal acts by the al-Ahmar military family 
culminated with the ignition of the civil war and the 
inter-Yemen war. 
  The newspaper indicated that the ugliest images of envy had 
become evident in the hundreds of dead and thousands of injured. 
The newspaper said in this connection: We do not find words to 
express this criminal tragedy experienced by our Yemeni people 
today as the result of a sick president and a family which is 
mainly concerned to preserve its interests and continues to 
[word indistinct] the people's fortunes and wealth. The 
newspaper quoted the proverb which says: He who digs a hole for 
his brother falls in. The newspaper went on to say that the 
al-Ahmar ruling family has declared confrontation between it and 
the people. The people must therefore join their armed forces 
in order to decide the match and normalize the matter by 
restoring the authority to the people so that the people and 
their armed forces could stand against this crime, which is 
commanded by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 'Ali Muhsin al- Ahmar and his 
brother, Muhammad 'Abdallah Salih and other highwaymen. SAWT 
AL-UMMAL said that the conspiracy against the people became 
complete with the ruling family's decision to declare a state of 
emergency. By this the family unmasked its ugly face, which is 
hostile to democracy, unity, and civil and human rights.

  [Text] Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member of the 
Presidential Council, has met with the brother directors of the 
administrations of the Presidential Council Office and several 
advisers, in the presence of brother Lieutenant General Sa'id 
Muhammad Ghanim, deputy chairman of the General Staff Command. 
  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani reviewed the stages of the 
development of the fabricated crisis and the [word indistinct] 
the secessionist leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
of declaring war at more than one location. 
  He pointed out that the objective of that leadership is to 
fragment national unity by inciting regional loyalties, 
stressing that the Yemeni people in all governorates are now 
aware of the conspiracy, especially after that leadership has 
rejected legitimacy and revealed its deep-rooted malice against 
defenseless citizens. 
  The brother member of the Presidential Council said all the 
concessions offered to the YSP did not change their sick, odious 
mentalities [words indistinct]. They continued to reject 
Islamic law as a frame of reference [words indistinct] a winery, 
and would not implement the decisions of the authorities to turn 
this winery, that violates the orders of God in broad daylight, 
into another factory that is useful to the citizens [words 
indistinct]. 
  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani also inspected the situation 
of the people at the site of the ugly, odious crime committed by 
the forces of apostasy and secession when a missile fell on the 
homes of secure citizens. 
  The member of the Presidential Council delivered a speech to 
a massive crowd that had flocked since early morning to the 
scene of the crime. He aid the enemies of unity and democracy 
have used the weapon the Yemeni people bought with their [word 
indistinct] and sweat. He said the Yemeni people in the 
southern governorates have suffered for 23 years and paid a 
heavy price as a result of malice and tyranny.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with engineer 'Abd-al-Mu'ti al-Junayd, </F>
deputy director of projects in the General Electricity 
Corporation, by 'Abd-al-Malik al-'Ayzari in the studio -- live 
or recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Al-Junayd] I am happy to explain to the brother 
citizens what happened to the electricity grid in the Dhamar 
area as a result of raids and shelling by the secessionists in 
the Ba Suhayb military camp. In fact, we are lucky because the 
damage was very limited, concentrating on electricity lines that 
extend from the station to feed the capital, Sanaa. 
  [Al-'Ayzari] This means the [words indistinct] lines? 
  [Al-Junayd] [Words indistinct] In the station itself, the 
damage is very minor and concentrated on the lines, [word 
indistinct] the lines extending from the Dhamar station to the 
capital, Sanaa. The brothers [words indistinct] took a position 
in favor of the constitutional legitimacy. Teams moved and the 
brothers from the General Electricity Corporation, with their 
equipment came and they defined the damage and began repair work. 
  The lines extend from the Dhamar transformers to Sanaa 
through two circuits. The teams in the area repaired the first 
circuit. A great effort was made and they were able to restore 
electric current to Sanaa. The day before yesterday at 8 or 9 
o'clock [am, pm not specified] they completed their task 
successfully, restoring power to Sanaa in a very normal way. 
  Repair work on the second circuit, which is really a reserve 
circuit, continues. It was hit harder. The brothers at the 
site [words indistinct] brother Ahmad al-'Ayni also present to 
have a firsthand knowledge of the situation. The repairs will 
be carried out and today, and tomorrow they will be able to 
repair everything and the electric power would be completely 
restored. 
  We tell the citizens that the electric current is available 
in the capital and there are no problems and their will be no 
cuts, God willing. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report from London by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi </F>
Shatarah, from Sanaa by Naji al-Harazi, from Damascus by Salwa 
al-Ustuwani, from Muscat by Sa'id 'Isa, and from the Aden and 
Cairo bureaus of AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] 
  [Excerpts] The bullets and shells in the Yemeni civil war 
were accompanied by a confrontation of a new type, aimed at 
holding the minds of those who have conducted the battles or 
participated in them, as the two sides disseminated conflicting 
communiques about the northern forces' potential capture of the 
city of Aden, and the distance between it and the battles. 
  While the communiques issued by Sanaa yesterday indicated 
the 
battles were going on 5 km from Aden, communiques and statements 
of the southern command said these battles were in al-Dali' in 
the Governorate of Lahij--at a distance of 100 km--and in 
Zinjibar, the capital of the Governorate of Abyan--about 40 km 
away. 
  Eyewitnesses in Aden said conditions were quiet there. No 
firing or shelling was heard, which would testify to the 
closeness of the battles to them in the areas of al-'Alam or Dar 
Sa'd. Employees went to their offices and places of work, 
merchants opened their doors, and while the sounds of distant 
explosions echoed, some said that they perhaps came from 
northern shelling in the Governorate of Lahij. 
  The Sultanate of Oman yesterday witnessed a large wave of 
refugees entering from southern Yemen, due to the escalation of 
the battles going on between the northern and southern forces. 
  An Omani source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that an Omani 
emergency committee was formed with the chairmanship of Musallam 
Bin-'Ali al-Busa'idi, minister of state and governor of Dhofar, 
to deal with this situation. The committee includes in its 
membership the director of labor in the southern part of the 
Sultanate and some officials from other agencies, among them the 
police and the armed forces. 
  This committee is being aided in its work by a similar 
committee in Muscat headed by the minister of social affairs and 
labor, Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Ahmad al-'Isa'i, and including 
officials from other government agencies. 
  Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, sultan of Oman, has implored the 
northern and southern leaders of Yemen to stop the battles, and 
expressed Oman's regret over the fighting in the Cabinet meeting 
held on Saturday. 
  In addition, Omani officials expect that the movement of 
refugees toward the southern Omani borders will increase if the 
intensity of the battles increases or they near the city of Aden 
or the Governorate of Hadramawt. 
  Feelings of unease are spreading among the Yemeni citizens 
in 
both Aden and Sanaa, but it appears that their morale in the two 
cities is high. All appear ready to bear up and withstand 
hardship for a long time, if this will bring Yemen to a happy 
condition, after the months of unrest that have prevailed during 
the Yemeni crisis since 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice president and 
secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], 
sequestered himself in Aden on 19 August. 
  Observers in Sanaa stated that several of its residents have 
decided to leave for their villages, not due to fear of the 
confrontation's widening and reaching the outskirts of the 
capital, but to protect their women, children, and elderly. They 
would possibly return to defend it if the situation required. 
The movement of people and cars do not give the impression that 
the situation is abnormal, except that the electricity is cut 
off from time to time, and gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene 
are scarce. 
  Residents told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that they are prepared to 
remain in Sanaa and defend it, even if the war continues between 
what they term the forces of legitimacy and the forces of the 
separatists in the YSP for several weeks to come. Most of those 
who belong to regions outside the capital are amazed at the 
behavior of those who have decided to leave the city and flee to 
their villages, asking: "How can they leave this city, which has 
afforded them a chance to work, live, profit, and acquire 
wealth?" 
  These people expressed confidence that the war will end in 
victory for the truth and the constitutional, legitimate will, 
no matter how long it takes. They indicated that the bombing 
that Sanaa suffers from time to time, especially during the 
night hours, cannot be worse than that during the 70 day siege 
in which the masses' will was victorious. They described those 
who fired rockets at or conducted airstrikes against Sanaa as 
"traitors who deserve the most severe punishment." 
  At the same time, Sanaa radio and television are carrying 
propaganda campaigns to raise the morale of the Yemenis and 
mobilize them against what are called "the forces of separatism 
and rebellion against constitutional legitimacy, led by 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid." 
  Sanaa news does not provide specific details on the course 
of 
the fighting, which has become narrowly confined, as northern 
sources say, around the approaches of the Governorate of Aden. 
In addition, it affirms the advance of what it describes as the 
forces of constitutional legitimacy, and the proximity of its 
control over the approaches to Aden, and perhaps over the city 
itself during the next few hours. 
  However, YSP sources affirm that this is absurd, and give as 
an example the communique that said day before yesterday "that 
the northern forces control the al-'Anad airport, while today 
this was proved untrue." 
  The [northern] sources stated that these forces are striving 
during their advance to minimize human and material losses as 
much as possible in the areas that they control, especially 
among the civilians who are, they said, appearing very 
sympathetic and supportive of [the North], contrary to what Aden 
radio and the communiques issued from there are repeating. 
  In addition, Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah's 
rejection of what was being said about Sanaa's acceptance of a 
delegation from the League of Arab States to mediate in the 
Yemeni crisis produced a positive reaction among many of the 
citizens. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT talked to them about this, and they 
confirmed their support for President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salim's 
position refusing any foreign intervention or mediation at this 
very late stage of the crisis. 
  They also confirmed their support for what is being 
expressed 
in Sanaa and what Yemeni Interior Ministry sources are claiming, 
that the war going on now is not between the North and the 
South, or the northern and southern armies, but is a Yemeni war 
between forces defending constitutional legitimacy and forces 
defending the interests of some of the YSP leaders who they 
described as" [unfinished sentence as published] [passage 
omitted on statements by the foreign minister, Jordan's Arab 
League representative, the Arab League's assistant secretary 
general, on the possible intervention of Arab League states to 
mediate in the crisis] 
  In Aden, Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, head of the secretariat of 
the YSP, condemned the destruction caused by the northern 
authorities in the YSP Central Committee headquarters in Sanaa 
and inquired as to the fate of Salih 'Abbad (Muqbil), a 
Political Bureau member and member of the Senate presidency, who 
is in Sanaa and whose whereabouts are not currently known. He 
indicated "the absurdity of Sanaa's claim that its forces are 
nearing Aden" and welcomed "any efforts to stop the bloodshed in 
Yemen." 
  For his part, the former South Yemeni president, 'Ali Nasir 
Muhammad, called for a stop to the fighting, but insisted that 
the solution should be a Yemeni one, and rejected the sending of 
any Arab forces to Yemen. He affirmed that his forces are 
fighting for the Yemeni people's future, security, and stability.

  [Text] Islamabad, May 11 -- A Foreign Office spokesman 
while talking to THE MUSLIM Wednesday [11 May] night 
categorically denied that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto held a 
meeting with Israeli President Weizman in South Africa. 
  Asked to comment on Israeli Radio's Persian language news 
about Benazir-Weizman meeting on May 10, the spokesman described 
it a fabrication. He said that it was part of the 
disinformation campaign of Israeli Radio to malign Pakistan by 
spreading lies. He said that in the past also, Israeli Radio 
had been spreading false news about such contacts. 
  Israeli Radio in its Persian language news broadcast at 7 pm 
on May 10, had stated that Israeli President Weizman held a 
meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Ms Bhutto in South Africa. 
It said the experts were of the view that this unprecedented 
meeting was an indication that Pakistan was moving towards 
establishment of full-fledged diplomatic relations with Israel.

  [Text] Pakistan has expressed its concern over the Indian 
decision to deploy Prithvi and Agni missiles. A spokesman of 
the Foreign Office, while briefing newsmen in Islamabad today, 
said that Pakistan has informed the Missile Technology Control 
Regime countries, including USA, that the Indian decision will 
further aggravate the threat to peace and security in South Asia 
and unleash a specter of nuclear missile race in the region. He 
hoped that the world community will prevail upon India to stop 
this reckless move. 
  The spokesman said India has increased violations of the 
Line 
of Control and its helicopters had twice infiltrated into the 
territory of Azad Jammu and Kashmir on the 5th of this month. 
He said three innocent civilians had been killed and five 
wounded by Indian firing during the last two weeks. 
  Referring to the recent spate of baseless allegations 
leveled 
by India regarding Pakistan's involvement in occupied Kashmir, 
the spokesman said this would further heighten tension between 
the two countries. In fact, the spokesman said, India was 
engaged in spreading terrorism in Pakistan. Pakistani troops 
had recently arrested two armed terrorists from Kotli sector, 
trained by India to carry out sabotage activities in Pakistan. 
Fifty-two kg of explosives was recovered from them. 
  The spokesman said that 2,000 Pakistani troops would be 
deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina by June this year under UN 
auspices. He said 40 of them are being trained in Germany, 
while rest of the contingent is getting training in 
Czechoslovakia [as heard] with German equipment.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said 
that Pakistan would continue to extend its full support to the 
Kashmiri people in their just struggle against the Indian 
occupation forces so that they can achieve their right of 
self-determination according to the UN resolution. 
  Speaking at the installation ceremony of the new colonel 
commandant of Baloch Regiment, she reiterated that Pakistan will 
not budge an inch from its principled stand on Kashmir. The 
prime minister said no nation can be subjugated for long with 
bullets and swords. The day will come when the Kashmiris will 
be able to achieve their rights, she said. 
  The prime minister said Pakistan has no aggressive designs 
against any country. It believes in peaceful coexistence. It 
desires to have good neighborly relations with all on the basis 
of equality, but it cannot compromise on its principle just for 
the sake of friendship. Pakistan cannot allow anyone to cast an 
evil eye on its independence and solidarity. The prime minister 
said that the government is fully conscious of the needs of its 
armed forces and is taking all steps to meet their requirements. 
It is doing its best to keep the armed forces fully equipped to 
effectively defend the country to frustrate any aggression.

  [Text] Islamabad (APP) -- Foreign Minister Sardar Asif 
Ahmad Ali said here Saturday that there was a total alienation 
with Indian rule in occupied Kashmir and, the Kashmiri people 
wanted only freedom. 
  Speaking on the topic "foreign policy agenda of Pakistan", 
at 
the round-table with the government organised by the economists 
conferences, at a local hotel, he said, "it is our considered 
opinion that India will not succeed in crushing the Kashmiri 
freedom struggle". 
  "This is the lesson of history, even recent history", he 
said, adding, "India is unlikely to be able to promote a viable 
internal political process in Kashmir. There is total 
alienation with Indian rule. The Kashmiri people want only 
freedom, Azadi", he said. 
  Pakistan, he said, believed that United States and its 
Western allies, as well as China, Russia and Japan, could play a 
critical role in promoting peace and security in South Asia. He 
said, the United States enjoyed considerable influence with both 
India and Pakistan. "This can be used to convince New Delhi 
that in the emerging era, the path to greatness does not lie 
through the accumulation of arms or nuclear weapons or missile 
capability but through economic and social progress and 
modernisation", he stated. 
  He said, the past experience indicated that Pakistan and 
India would be able to resolve their mutual disputes only with 
the intercession of a third party. "Therefore, we welcome the 
recent proposal of the United Stated to promote multilateral 
talks on South Asian security. These talks will deal with the 
inter-related problems of non-proliferation, conventional arms, 
and development of weapons of mass destruction", he added. In 
the emerging era of international relations Sardar Asif said, 
Pakistan was faced with a series of challenges. But, it was also 
offered a number of opportunities. "With wisdom, patience, hard 
work and with the help of our friends, Pakistan can overcome the 
challenges and seize the opportunities", he said. 
  Elaborating the challenges, he said, these were mostly the 
legacy of the past of the colonial and cold-war eras. 
  Continuing, Sardar Asif said, "we are now entering into a 
new 
phase where Pakistan and the United States have agreed to 
develop their relationship despite the Pressler law which both 
governments have recognised as bad law and worse policy". 
  "A new cooperative engagement between Pakistan and the 
United 
States was agreed during the recent visit of the Deputy 
Secretary of Sate Talbott to Islamabad", he said. 
  About Sino-Pak relations, he said, despite strategic 
changes, 
"these remain firm and unchangeable". "Both countries are 
continuing to cooperate in a number of areas, encompassing 
economic, commercial and defence. Chinese trade and economic 
cooperation can in future be promoted through Pakistan with 
other countries in Central Asia, West Asia and South Asia. If 
peace can be established between Pakistan and India and in 
Afghanistan, exciting possibilities could be created for 
economic cooperation among the countries of these adjacent 
regions. This would open massive markets and unleash enormous 
potential for production and consumption", he maintained. 
  The emergence of independent states in Central Asia, he 
said, 
was a decisive and historic watershed. 
  "It ushered in a new era for a vast region stretching from 
the Aral to the Arabian Sea. We rejoice at the return to 
history and at the rich prospects of reviving our common 
traditional and cultural heritage. But the fundamental fact is 
that these newly-independent states are all landlocked. Their 
future progress and prosperity will, in large measure, depend on 
the exploitation of the shortest access to regions beyond. The 
ending of their isolation has only heightened their quest for 
alternative routes to the rest of the world. Central Asia needs 
to sell its surplus energy including gas and oil to the 
voracious markets in East Asia. We ourselves can benefit from 
these resources. Pipelines to our coast can provide the most 
economical route", he stated. 
  The shortest route to the sea for Central Asia is through 
Pakistan, he said, adding: "We offer the most convenient 
transit facilities for their exports to other markets. He said, 
there existed the requisite road and railway systems that could 
be extended to Central Asia. "Then, there are port facilities 
we can share with them. In reverse, our port city of Karachi 
has a vibrant commercial sector and can provide an ideal 
launching pad for the commercial operations of multinationals in 
Central Asia. 
  About Afghanistan, he said, it would always be vital to any 
strategic access to Central Asia. "In Afghanistan, the fruits 
of a heroic victory have been lost to parochial ambition. 
Instability in Afghanistan has direct implications for 
Pakistan, among other things, in the shape of drug smuggling and 
banditry on our borders". Pakistan, he said, was engaged in an 
active process of rebuilding peace in Afghanistan. "A durable 
solution can only be achieved through compromise among the 
Afghans themselves. "We hope to present some ideas to the 
Afghan leaders in the near future", he said, adding, Pakistan 
remained hopeful of success. [quotation marks as published] 
  "However, as in Kashmir, so also in Afghanistan there is an 
opportunity waiting to be grasped within a crisis that requires 
urgent solution. It should be remembered that there is relative 
peace in many parts of Afghanistan. With some courage and 
imagination, trade between Pakistan and Central Asia can be 
commenced through the southern route traversing Kandhar and 
Herat. New opportunities for trade, and more credible hope of 
receiving international assistance, can help to convince Afghan 
leaders that there is a greater premium in commerce than in 
further fighting", he added.

  [Text] The all-party conference of national leaders in 
Karachi today adopted a resolution calling for the seizure of 
all illegal arms in Sindh Province. The conference participants 
condemned the politics of violence. The resolution says the 
time has now come for the government and the opposition to 
resolve their differences through negotiations, as their 
continued confrontation is against the interests of the province 
and the country. The resolution adds that since problems cannot 
be settled through the use of force, political problems should 
be resolved only through mutual dialogue. 
  The conference unanimously adopted another resolution, 
expressing the hope that Pakistan will not roll back its nuclear 
program unilaterally. The resolution says Pakistan has always 
opposed the use of force and its nuclear program is solely for 
peaceful purposes. The resolution also says the international 
community can easily assess India's ambitions from its recent 
statement about its nuclear program. 
  In yet another resolution, the conference appealed to 
Islamic 
countries to support the struggle of the Kashmiri people.

  [Text] Peshawar, May 10 -- Following fresh peace efforts in 
Afghanistan President Borhanoddin Rabbani has agreed to step 
down from his office by the end of year in order to pave way for 
new democratic set-up. 
  Disclosing this at a news conference here on Tuesday, the 
peace delegation of Mutahidda Ulema Council led by its Deputy 
Secretary General, Prof Mohammad Yahya, who returned from Kabul 
on Monday evening, claimed that both the warlords of 
Afghanistan, Rabbani and Hekmatyar have agreed to their peace 
formula with the exception of two points, which were still to be 
resolved. 
  During their meetings with Afghan President and Prime 
Minister they found no real differences between the two rather 
they agreed in principle to the formation of an interim Shoora 
for framing electoral roll and meeting other requirements within 
a year [sentence as published]. But the bone of contention was 
that how and who would form the Shoora. Rabbani was of the view 
that Shoora should have at least one thousand members from all 
provinces while Hekmatyar wanted a Shoora of maximum hundred 
members only from Jehad forces, he disclosed. 
  Mohammad Yahya said that the main objective of the peace 
mission was to coordinate the peace efforts of Jalaluddin 
Haqqani, he has been making since Ramadzan last, for striking a 
patch-up between the warring factions. He claimed that because 
of his successful mediation the agreement between Rabbani and 
Hekmatyar was only a few steps away as the main irritants have 
been removed. He said that the two parties were tired of 
fighting and wanted to put an end to hostilities for good. 
  He said that during its three-day stay in Afghanistan, the 
delegation witnessed tremendous development in the peace process 
and considerable flexibility by the leaders of the warring 
factions as all of them were now ready to settle the dispute 
within the framework of the text of peace formula announced by 
the mediating commission of Haqqani. However, he alleged that 
some miscreants from both sides were sabotaging their efforts by 
escalating the fighting further. 
  He claimed that apart from political circles all segments in 
Afghanistan welcomed their peace efforts and insisted that their 
delegation should stay in Afghanistan till finding any possible 
solution to the crisis. He said Haqqani's commission was there 
to continue the peace plan. 
  He bitterly criticised the winding up of Pakistani Embassy 
in 
Afghanistan saying that this step of the government has enabled 
the "RAW" [Research and Analysis Wing] to use to use its open 
hand against Pakistan. He feared that the agents of "RAW" were 
fully active to create hatred among Afghans against Pakistan. 
He demanded of the government to reopen its Embassy in Kabul to 
encounter the anti-Pakistan activities of the "RAW". 
  Commenting on Mehmud Mestiri's efforts for paving way for 
the 
former monarch of Afghanistan Zahir Shah, he said that one of 
the main warring factions has categorically rejected him as a 
mediator. 
  Answering a query, he denied the impression that their peace 
efforts were aimed at providing relief to Rabbani for 
reestablishing his position.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Threat To Use Force"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. secretary of the Army has threatened that 
if certain countries do not abandon their nuclear programs, the 
United States will use force to terminate their programs. 
Addressing special centenary celebrations for the U.S. Army 
Command and Staff College, he said that some countries have 
acquired the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons. The 
United States is trying to persuade them in a friendly manner, 
but it will not refrain from using force if these efforts fail. 
Ejazul Haq, a former Pakistani minister and member of the 
National Assembly who was present at the function, told JANG's 
special correspondent that although the secretary did not 
mention Pakistan in his speech, it was obvious that he was 
referring to us. This is because he addressed Ejazul Haq in 
particular before mentioning the threat to use force and excused 
himself to Haq when he did mention it. 
  The United States is keenly interested in nuclear 
nonproliferation. It is no secret that it is striving to 
realize this objective throughout the world. It is also 
evident, though, that the U.S. campaign against nuclear weapons 
is neither equitable nor impartial. It has no objection to 
certain countries' nuclear programs and is indirectly assisting 
and supporting the advancement and success of their programs. 
The most conspicuous example is Israel. 
  Informed sources are aware that Israel not only has the 
capability to produce nuclear weapons, it also has a huge 
stockpile of such weapons. Despite knowing this, the United 
States has never expressed any concern about Israel's nuclear 
capability or threatened Israel. On the contrary, Israel tops 
the list of countries receiving U.S. foreign aid. The two 
countries have pursued very close and longstanding technical 
cooperation. It would not be incorrect to say that the United 
States and Israel are two bodies sharing a single heart. It is 
also no secret why the United States has been ignoring the 
Israeli nuclear program. The United States considers Israel its 
closest ally in the Middle East, like a virtual state of the 
United States, and is deeply interested in accelerating its 
defense and nuclear capabilities. 
  Similarly, although the United States keeps protesting 
against the Indian nuclear program, it has never adopted a tough 
stand against the increase in India's nuclear capability, as it 
has with Pakistan or North Korea. In fact, there were occasions 
when the United States -- through France -- indirectly helped 
India continue its nuclear program. Given the circumstances, 
the U.S. threat to use force against Pakistan is very 
regrettable and deserves to be condemned. This attitude is all 
the more amazing in view of the fact that Pakistan has already 
made some very rational and just proposals for winding up its 
nuclear program. Pakistan has proposed that the Indian Ocean be 
made a nuclear-free zone. Pakistan has expressed its readiness 
to open its nuclear installations for international inspection 
on the condition that India does the same. 
  Pakistan has also expressed its willingness to sign the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty provided that India does as 
well. India has not made any positive response to these 
rational and practical proposals. The logical next step would 
have been for the United States and the Western powers to exert 
pressure on India to achieve the goal of nuclear 
nonproliferation. Even if we acknowledge that such pressure was 
exerted, we cannot deny it was done in a half-hearted manner. 
  During U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott's recent visit 
to Pakistan, Pakistan expressed its willingness to implement any 
just proposal on nuclear nonproliferation. The Indian response, 
on the other hand, was disappointing. Under the circumstances, 
the U.S. secretary's threat of using force against Pakistan is 
incomprehensible and extremely regrettable. We are fully 
confident that despite the U.S. secretary's threat, Pakistan 
will adhere to its principled stand and that the United States 
will not succeed in bullying this country. It is inappropriate 
for the United States to use such language. 
  Certain quarters of the Pakistani Government are overly 
optimistic that a way can be found to provide limited defense 
aid to Pakistan despite the Pressler Amendment. The latest 
pronouncement by the U.S. secretary of the Army should be enough 
of an eye opener. The Pakistani Government should seriously make 
every possible effort to meet its defense needs through 
non-American sources. Also, the government should obtain the 
text of the secretary's speech, examine its implications, and 
lodge a protest with the U.S. Government if warranted.
