<F P=106> [Article by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich: </F>
"To See the Essence"] 
  [Text] There are events in people's lives that define their 
destiny and development for many years to come. Thereby, it is 
no accident that the monetary merger treaty between Belarus and 
Russia has attracted such attention. The ink on the paper had 
not yet dried -- as they simply put it -- when this document 
became the focal point of many political disputes. Various 
borderline opinions and statements -- varying from complete 
approval to absolute rejection -- appeared. Therefore, I 
consider it necessary to explain why the Belarusian Government 
took this step, what is the essence of the document concerning 
the single ruble zone, what does this agreement provide our 
economy, people, and the Republic as a whole. 
<H5>  From the Previous History of the Agreement </H5>
  We all know that after the fall of the USSR, two tendencies 
prevailed in the development of newly independent states: The 
first one was a disintegration theory, supporters of which 
advocated complete disintegration and the second one -- the idea 
of integration. 
  The government of our Republic always favored the process of 
integration. I already foresee a question: How can I explain 
my signing of the Belaya Vezha agreement? Why did I undertake 
this step? Only because it was necessary to set up a civilized 
procedure for that process of disintegration, which was widely 
spreading across a big state. Viskuli initiators cannot be 
blamed for the fall of the USSR: The key reason for this was 
Gorbachev's illogical policy, which brought the Union to a state 
of utter chaos. Because by December 1991 -- when the Baltic 
republics and Ukraine declared that they were leaving the USSR 
and the Russian Supreme Soviet declared the supremacy of its 
laws over the USSR Constitution -- the Soviet Union as a state 
ceased to exist. Interethnic conflicts were erupting. 
  Let us now recall the gist of the Belaya Vezha agreement. 
They advocated the need to set up a joint economic zone, 
thereby building economic relations "on the basis of the 
existing tender -- the ruble" -- pursuing an agreed-upon policy 
in the budget sector; coordinating activities among customs 
services; providing for the free flow of transit shipments. 
  Therefore, it is easy to see -- if we compare the Viskuli 
agreement with the monetary merger pact -- that the second 
document reflects the agreement that had specified the setting 
up and functioning of the CIS. 
  We have never opposed and do not oppose the CIS. However, 
what happened within the CIS over the past two and a half years 
cannot be called anything other than the stalling of development. 
  Given this situation, the expediency of setting a close 
economic union between Belarus and Russia, based on a single 
monetary system, cannot raise any doubts. By the way, we are 
not inventing anything. The joint monetary system --as an 
expression of the highest degree of integration between states 
-- existed within the framework of the former USSR, and our aim 
is to restore its advantages to our Republic. 
  Let us discuss the key aspect of this issue -- the economy. 
  Indexes of specific proportions of resources imported to 
Belarus and of exported Belarusian products show the importance 
of cooperation with Russia for our Republic. For example, in 
1993 (which was not the best year for our economy), of all the 
oil used in Belarus, we had to import 86 percent; natural gas -- 
100 percent; rolled steel -- 42 percent. At the same time, of 
all exports of Belarusian-made goods, Russia bought 51 percent 
of all trucks, 44.4 percent of all tractors, 42.8 percent of all 
refrigerators and deep-freezers, and 42.8 percent of all silk. 
  In other words, our economy, first and foremost, our 
industry 
is closely connected with the Russian market for raw materials 
and products. When these relations broke down due to Russia's 
increased prices -- up to world levels -- for energy resources 
and raw materials exported to Belarus, our Republic immediately 
suffered "a breakdown." 
  I can provide you with some figures. Over the first quarter 
of this year alone, the volume of net national income in Belarus 
fell by 38 percent in comparison with the same period last year. 
Due to the failure to sell products because of high prices, on 
both domestic and foreign markets, warehouses and trading 
facilities have amassed Belarusian-made industrial products 
worth some 4.7 trillion rubles. Tens of thousands of large 
industrial enterprises are faced with the threat of shutting 
down. The specter of unemployment has begun to haunt thousands 
of people. 
  This is the answer to the question: What has happened? 
<H5>  On the Gist of the Agreement </H5>
  The agreement includes the treaty itself and seven [as 
published] bilateral documents, which represent its 
indispensable constituent parts. 
  The process of unifying the monetary systems will be carried 
out in two stages. During the first stage, which will begin on 
1 May of this year, all tariff and tax restrictions, as well as 
customs duties on trade will be lifted. It is natural that this 
applies only to goods produced on the territory of Belarus and 
Russia. At the same time, customs duties will be imposed on 
products produced in other countries (currently, a single 
mechanism regarding their functioning is being drafted). 
  Nontariff barriers -- quoting and licensing which rule out 
dual taxation -- will be retained until the monetary merger is 
completed, because these quotas --proceeding from the volumes of 
mutual deliveries between enterprises -- have already been set. 
  The most acute issue in the package of monetary merger 
documents is the Belarusian National Bank issue. You know that 
Belarusian National Bank Chairman S. S. Bahdankevich signed this 
agreement with reservations regarding its clause No. 5, which 
contradicts some of the paragraphs of the Belarusian 
Constitution. I can understand him. The documents, which 
concern every citizen of Belarus, were drafted while one 
constitution was in force and they were ready and signed after 
another had gone into effect. I hope that a solution will be 
found. A formula, enabling us to consider all mutually 
beneficial interests and on this basis strengthening Belarusian 
statehood as an equal and esteemed member of the world 
community, will be found. 
  I am not a naive man and I understand perfectly well that it 
is not very ethical and correct to modify the Constitution, 
which has just been adopted. Therefore, we, having signed the 
agreement, had set up a basis for future talks. When Supreme 
Soviet Chairman M. I. Hryb and I were present at the recent CIS 
summit, we met with Russian President B. N. Yeltsin and found an 
understanding on his part that it is necessary to formulate 
clause No. 5 in such a way that could unable us to painlessly 
resolve the constitution issue. 
  Many people ask: If separate clauses of the agreement 
contradicted the new Constitution, why had I signed it? 
Everything is extremely simple: I signed this agreement for 
the sake of the remaining nine documents that will come into 
force on 1 May. For how long can we hold our economy in this 
crisis? My signature meant that all customs duties will be 
removed on the fixed date, meaning a reduction of the total cost 
of products by 30-40 percent. 
  As a result, production costs will be reduced, Belarusian 
producers will receive access to traditional Russian markets. 
Eventually, it will cause a reduction in retail prices and an 
improvement in the life of our people. These are the motives, 
the only ones (and not political competitiveness) which dictated 
my actions. 
  As for the exchange rate of Belarusian "hares" for Russian 
cash, which is of especial interest for our citizens, the 
exchange will be carried out at a 1:1 rate to a maximum of 
200,000 Belarusian rubles per individual. Therefore, if, for 
example, a family consists of five members, then it will be able 
to exchange "hares" for the sum of 1 million rubles [R]. In 
addition, individuals who have bank accounts and deposits will 
be able to exchange their money at the same exchange rate, 
however, the total will be limited to R1 million. However, 
together with the increase in retail prices in Russia, the 
aforementioned maximum sums of money that are subject to 
exchange at a 1:1 rate will also be increased. 
  The issue with the exchange rate of savings, which exceed 
the 
aforementioned sums, and the revaluation of balances of 
accounts, inventories, assets and liabilities of enterprises, 
organizations, and all legal entities is more complicated. It 
will be set and drawn up on the basis of the parity of Russian 
and Belarusian currencies' buying capacity and their market rate 
against the dollar at the moment of the monetary merger (the 
current rate is some 1:5). 
<H5>  Who Is Against the Agreement? </H5>
  I do not want to waste time on debates with those who 
consider each decision of the government in both states to be 
"evil," "incorrect," or even "criminal." There are only a few of 
them; however, they are rowdy and make much noise. 
  Well, I have to admit that there are serious politicians and 
economists with their own vision of the issue among the 
adversaries of this agreement. Well, each person can have his 
own opinion and we have to respect his right. I am ready to 
argue with such people and defend my viewpoint. 
  I could conditionally divide such serious opponents into 
three categories in line with their positions. 
  The first group: The so-called "westerners." Their key 
argument is as follows: We should have concluded agreements not 
with Russia but with West European states. They have culture, 
they are civilized, they eat "bread and butter" while our 
Eastern neighbor has its own problems. It seems beautiful and 
convincing for many people. However, we should also consider 
historic traditions, the difference in economic development, the 
degree of integration of our economies, and the living standard. 
Besides, reality shows that the only real and prospective 
source of mineral resources (eventually, this is the key factor 
of our economy) for Belarus can only be Russia. We could come 
to Europe as equal partners only with Russia. 
  The second group is represented by "isolationists." If 
"westerners" criticize us for the allegedly flawed way of 
development, these people do not admit the Belarusian-Russian 
negotiations at all. Hence, their cries about the encroachment 
on our sovereignty, undermining of the statehood, betrayal of 
the national interests. Sometimes, the representatives of this 
trend speak about economic integration, political unions (let us 
recall the notorious Black-Baltic Seas union), however, they 
boil over everything. It seems to me that there is no neighbor 
left to whom they had not issued territorial claims. This is 
the first issue. Second, how can politicians speak about 
political integration if they already agreed that "national 
interests are superior to the interests of a person?" Mankind 
has already gone down this path and stained it with seas of 
blood. 
  The supporters of the so-called "tough" sovereignty, who 
foresee not only a breakdown of economic relations with Russia 
but a confrontation with it by issuing demands for leasing 
payments for the dislocation of Russian troops on Belarusian 
territory. 
  What can I say regarding this? 
  1. It is a well-known fact that Ukrainian attempts to divide 
the Black Sea Fleet with Russia have not brought about either 
economic advantages, or political stability. 
  2. Russian military units stationed on the Belarusian 
territory, in particular, the antiaircraft protection troops, 
ensure the security both for Russia and Belarus. 
  3. Belarus profits directly from this situation because it 
can reduce its own Armed Forces without harming its national 
security. 
  There is one more group of adversaries of the agreement. 
They are filthy dealers in the currency black market on both 
sides of our eastern border. They are less noisy and 
eye-catching but not less dangerous. They use the 
underdevelopment of our financial infrastructure; they play on 
the difference in exchange rates and prices for essential 
foodstuff and consumer goods and to generate substantial income. 
Who will voluntarily refuse such huge profits? Therefore, these 
people can go to extremes and hamper efforts to put our house in 
order, to raise the economy, to introduce civilized economic 
methods. 
  An attempt to torpedo and drown the idea of an economic 
union 
of two fraternal states will hardly win. Finally, the 
Belarusian-Russian agreement responds to the core interests of 
our peoples, and this is the key issue. By the way, according 
to polls, conducted by a range of sociological agencies in our 
Republic, including independent ones, more than 65 percent of 
the Belarusian population support the monetary merger of our two 
states. 
  Currently, all, who support the government's policy aimed at 
setting up a strong, long-term union with Russia, live through 
hard times. We are experiencing tough pressure from various 
sides. Nevertheless, we have made our choice. I am ready to 
bring this issue to an end because I am deeply convinced that 
only in the union with Russia will we find our salvation, the 
salvation of our young sovereign state in which, and I am sure 
of that, our children and grandchildren and all the generations 
to come will live happily. 
  Therefore, I am addressing Belarusian citizens: You will be 
judges in this historic process. Only the people's opinion can 
be a criterion for the truth.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Is Brest Oblast the `Cradle' of </F>
Statehood?"] 
  [Text] At some enterprises in the city of Kobryn, the 
collection of signatures in support of the main contender for 
the presidential chair, Vyacheslaw Kebich, is being conducted by 
management itself. Appropriate directives have been given to 
heads of workshops and foremen. Workers have been given a 
choice: Either to put their signatures supporting the 
"formidable" candidate or to face difficulties promised by 
managers. Under conditions of general job reductions, many 
prefer to avoid problems. 
  Thus, the Brest Oblast may successfully continue its "good" 
traditions and become once again the "cradle" of a new head of 
state, as it was with Slyunkow [secretary of the Communist Party 
of Soviet Belarus] and Dzemyantsey [former Supreme Soviet 
speaker].

  [Text] The management and personnel of the Belarusian KGB 
held a conference connected with the decision to alter the KGB's 
structure and the size of its staff. As KGB Chairman Henadz 
Lavitski pointed out in a speech, the goal of the reform is to 
bring the KGB structure in line with the main purpose of the 
special service and its current demands, as well as to avoid any 
improper functions. The main trends of Belarusian KGB 
activities will be conducting intelligence and 
counterintelligence operations, as well as providing the 
authorities with information necessary for adopting resolutions 
at the state level. The KGB will also participate in 
implementing a state program for combating crime, coordinating 
its activities with other law enforcement bodies and strictly 
adhering to its responsibilities and existing legislation.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Bushev: "Qadi Appointed To Be </F>
Responsible for Religious Affairs"] 
  [Text] Ashgabad -- Just four years ago, there were only 16 
mosques functioning on Turkmenia's [Turkmenistan's] huge 
territory; now 180 have been built, and around another 100 are 
in the completion stage. What is going on? After all, everyone 
-- from the famous Arminiy Vamberi to the travelers of our 
century -- has unfailingly talked of the Turkmens as one of the 
peoples least disposed to religious dogmatism? 
  Fears are idle -- fundamentalism will not cross into 
Turkmenia. The policy of building a secular society proclaimed 
by President S. Niyazov recently received further confirmation. 
  Gathering a large number of believers around a banquet table 
on a small strip of grass outside the city, the Turkmen 
President announced his model for relations between the people 
and the religious aristocracy. 
  "There are people who want religious rites and customs to be 
inculcated in everyone on a compulsory basis," Turkmenbashi 
complained. "This is heard especially frequently from the 
clergy. But Turkmens have never allowed anyone to force them to 
do anything." 
  Formerly, leadership of religion in the republic has been 
exercised by the Council for Religious Affairs under the Cabinet 
of Ministers, retained from Soviet times. S. Niyazov announced 
the decision to create a new structure. Henceforth, there will 
be something like a committee or ministry for religion, but this 
time under the country's president. It will be headed by the 
supreme religious official -- the qadi of all Turkmenia. His 
deputy will be the leader of the Turkmenistan Orthodox churches. 
Both are to be assigned a ministerial salary of 1,000 manats, 
and, like all Turkmen ministers, they will travel in state 
"Volvos." 
  At the conclusion of the meeting religious figures appealed 
to the Almighty to bless the Turkmen leader.

  [Text] Turkmenistan has introduced, starting with May, a 
special commercial rate of exchange for its national currency, 
the manat, at which banks will carry out transactions with 
individuals. 
  The rate will be 60 manats per dollar, while the official 
rate is 10 per dollar, and is expected to stay until further 
notice by the Central Bank. Meanwhile, the street value of the 
dollar in Ashkhabad is 90 to 95 manats. 
  All banks are allowed to buy hard currency at that 
commercial 
rate. The country's Vneshekonombank (foreign economic bank) and 
the joint stock commercial bank Turkmenistan have a right to 
exchange manats for dollars at this rate for Turkmenistan 
citizens go abroad while the Investbank will sell hard currency 
to individuals in cashless transactions to enable them to pay 
for cargo transportation abroad. The banks will not handle 
transactions with individuals involving more than 500 dlrs. 
  In mid-March the manat was devalued from 1.99 to 10 per 
dollar. Simultaneously the government announced its intention to 
introduce a floating rate of exchange which was to be dictated 
by the prices at the country's inter-bank exchange. Following 
the first trading on 14 March 1994, when the banks sold 150,000 
dlrs at a rate of 10 manats the exchange was suspended and the 
official rate stayed invariable despite the 30 percent monthly 
inflation rate.

  [Text] On Monday [2 May], the German ambassador acting on 
behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, accompanied by 
the two other "troika-members," the Danish ambassador and the 
French charge d'affaires, made a demarche with the foreign 
minister of Estonia in connection with slow implementation of 
the aliens law, the German Embassy in Estonia informed ETA. 
  "The European Union expresses concern to the Estonian 
Government regarding the implementation by Estonian authorities 
of some aspects of the aliens law which came into force on 12 
July 1993," the demarche says. "The European Union considers 
that all state organs, including the parliament, have a 
particular role in stabilizing the situation of the non-citizens 
and in contributing towards their future integration into 
Estonian society," it continues. 
  Estonian Foreign Ministry press service told ETA that at the 
meeting with Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik, the "European 
Union stressed that it accepts Estonian aliens law and its 
juridical logic." 
  Spokeswoman of the Ministry Mari-Ann Rikken told ETA that 
the 
demarche had no connection whatsoever with the Russian troop 
withdrawal issue from Estonia and European Union still demanded 
Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia by 31 August 1994, 
connecting it to no other issues. 
  Rikken said that the demarche was caused by discontent of 
the 
EU in the slow application of the law, which has caused "tension 
and dissatisfaction" among non-citizens. 
  Last week, the ruling coalition decided at its two-day 
meeting in Lohusalu near Tallinn, that the implementation of the 
aliens law had to be prolonged and most probably the application 
deadline for residence and working permits for the aliens will 
be prolonged for one year from the present 12 July 1994 
deadline. Deputy head of the ruling Fatherland Party Kalle 
Jurgenson told the POSTIMEES daily that in the nearest future a 
respectable bill on amending the aliens law will be handed in to 
Riigikogu [parliament] proceedings.

  [Text] Tallinn, 2 May, BNS -- Mainly elderly residents 
from northeast Estonia's Russian-populated cities of Narva and 
Sillamae formed a human chain on the Tallinn-St. Petersburg 
highway Sunday [1 May], demanding permanent resident's status 
and higher pensions. 
  The picketers demanded the authorities to grant a permanent 
resident's status to everybody who has the Estonian resident's 
status stamp in their Soviet passports from earlier than July 
1990, said Nikolai Klotschkov, editor in chief of Sillamae's 
local newspaper. 
  Other demands included amendments to the pension law, 
determining of the cost of living index, and increasing the 
pensions of retired workers of the nuclear industry -- the 
leading branch for decades under the Soviet rule in the once 
closed-for-outsiders military plant town of Sillamae. 
  The roadside picket, organized by local pensioners unions, 
was called by the activists a "Baltic Chain", referring to the 
23 Aug 1989, event under the same name. 
  In 1989, Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians linked their 
hands in a chain extending from Tallinn to Vilnuis to demand 
from the then Soviet leadership official denouncement of the 
1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.

<F P=106> [From 3 May HOMMIKULEHT, p 1; "News Bulletin" No. 84] </F>
  [Text] MP [member of parliament] Mart Niklus, vice 
chairman of the Independent faction, presented a report of the 
Defence League Tartu unit of a secret meeting of Russian 
officers held in Tartu on 23 April and concerning the 
organisation of an armed coup. 
  The plans concern all Estonia's regions and the conspirators 
have the necessary armament, Niklus told yesterday's traditional 
picket at the Russian Naval HQ. The intended date is not known 
yet, he admitted. 
  Niklus added that subversive groups are located in several 
towns and they intend to present their actions to the 
international public as a civil war, which would justify the 
intervention of the Russian Army. 
  Niklus also claimed that the evacuation of the Paldiski 
nuclear reactors will cost the Estonian taxpayers 10 million 
kroons and called for the suspension of granting residence 
permits to aliens until the completion of the troops withdrawal. 
  Riigikogu [parliament] Vice Chairman Tunne Kelam later 
dismissed the call, explaining that the suspension would be an 
unreasonable act.

million kroons for the cost of dismantling the nuclear reactors 
at Paldiski. Justice Minister Kaido Kama emphasized at a

<F P=106> [Interview with Ruben Mirzakhanyan, leader of the Armenian </F>
Democratic Liberal Party, by Karen Topchyan in Yerevan; date not 
given: "Armenia: Civil War Would Be Catastrophe"] 
  [Text] Many observers describe the political situation in 
Armenia as quite calm. Is that right? Your ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
correspondent's conversation with Ruben Mirzakhanyan, leader of 
one of Armenia's most influential opposition parties, 
Ramkavar-Azatakan (the Democratic Liberal Party), began with 
this question. 
  [Mirzakhanyan] I think that it is nonetheless only apparent 
calm. But one thing is indisputable: There has been a drastic 
decline in protest activity of late. 
  [Topchyan] The president promised that a new constitution 
would be adopted this year. 
  [Mirzakhanyan] I believe that the country's new fundamental 
law will be adopted within the year, and this means new 
parliamentary and presidential elections. 
  [Topchyan] Armenia is virtually the only republic in the 
former Union where the parliament has been operating 
successfully for four years now and Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who has 
been the state's leader for as many years, is clearly not 
thinking of retiring. 
  [Mirzakhanyan] I think that this is due to three factors: 
First, the militarily favorable development of events in 
Karabakh. Since early 1992 the Armenians have held the 
initiative in the Karabakh-Azerbaijani war. Imagine if the 
picture had been different. The second factor is that Armenia's 
leader, unlike the representatives of the new political wave in 
certain other independent states that were once USSR republics, 
is more restrained in both domestic and foreign policy. Third, 
for various reasons Armenia's parliament has not in its 
four-year activity been a major adversary of the executive, the 
president included. 
  [Topchyan] How are events in Russia affecting life in 
Armenia? 
  [Mirzakhanyan] Very directly. That is quite natural, since 
we are all heirs to the same political traditions. 
  [Topchyan] Do you not think it rather phenomenal that 
effectively all the political forces in Armenia unequivocally 
favor alliance-partnership relations with Russia? 
  [Mirzakhanyan] It would be incredibly hard for Armenia to 
build its future without close partnership relations with Russia. 
  [Topchyan] What is your forecast regarding the probable 
development of political events in Armenia? 
  [Mirzakhanyan] It depends directly on the changes under way 
in Moscow. If there are many unknown quantities in Russia's 
future, the same can be said about the future of Armenia.

  [Text] Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan sent a 
letter to Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in February 
this year asking him to support the Armenian Government's 
request for financial assistance from the EU to reopen the 
Armenian nuclear plant. 
  In his reply, the Greek prime minister gave assurances that 
he will spare no effort in supporting the request of the 
Armenian Government, but at the same time he expressed the 
following view: Considering that most of the EU countries are 
concerned about safety in connection with the Armenian nuclear 
plant, Armenia needs to completely convince the international 
community that the opening of the nuclear plant will in no way 
pose a danger. 
  I want to reiterate the Greek Government's determination to 
actively contribute to your country's economic reforms and 
democratic processes to which you and the friendly Armenian 
people remain dedicated, wrote Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou at the end of his letter.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Mkrtchyan: "Armenia: Dying Patient </F>
Receives Shock Treatment"] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- Trenchant discussion over the 
privatization of industrial enterprises has begun in Armenia. 
The charged nature of the discussion is largely due to the fact 
that the land reform implemented in the republic, which 
established private ownership of land and compulsorily 
eliminated all collective and state farms, has brought the 
complete collapse of the agraraian sector. 
  Prime Minister G. Bagratyan, author of the "Armenian 
version" 
of reforms, recently stated that the government of the Republic 
sees the abandonment of state ownership as the only way to 
create the conditions necessary for effective production 
activity. The crux of the "Armenian version" of privatization, 
which was approved by the World Bank last year, basically 
amounts to the fact that 20 percent of shares in denationalized 
enterprises are to be retained by members of labor collectives. 
The free purchase and sale of vouchers will be carried out. 
Moreover, the government intends to ensure that businessmen who 
belong to the Armenian diaspora have free access to the purchase 
of shares in privatized enterprises. 
  The authors of the "Armenian version" of reforms, as 
advocates of notorious "shock therapy," consider that society 
has to go through a long period of tough trials. The whole 
construct of such rapid and unconditional privatization of 
industry, which is close in essence to Gaydar's reforms, is 
posited on the highly dubious postulate that it is impossible to 
manage the state sector of the economy in conditions of free 
prices. Thus, the reformists of the Armenian economy are trying 
to relieve the state from a host of commitments and concerns 
regarding the people's welfare. 
  "Shock therapy" in local conditions will lead to the 
predominance of corrupt groups and clans in the sphere of the 
economy.

  [Text] The Georgian parliament resumed its work yesterday. 
The session started with quorum problems. Parliamentary Speaker 
Vakhtang Goguadze proposed to broaden the powers of the 
speaker's office, enabling it to apply effective sanctions 
[against deputies who fail to attend]. The head of state said 
that parliament should consider this proposal if it wants its 
legislative activity to be more productive. 
  After a quorum was reached, Deputy Shalva Natelashvili 
submitted a proposal concerning amendments to the provisional 
rules of procedure. He said that plenary sessions of parliament 
should be held less frequently to allow deputies to work in 
commissions. 
  The head of state supported this idea. In his opinion, 
parliament's legislative activity cannot be replaced by decrees. 
The bulk of work should be carried out in commissions. 
  The second proposal on the agenda addressed the old painful 
problem of the coupon. Deputy Prime Minister Teimuraz Basilia 
said that the Cabinet of Ministers has set up a commission 
responsible for reorganizing the financial system. The 
commission has been entrusted with drafting specific steps aimed 
at strengthening the coupon and revitalizing the economy. In 
its work, the commission will take into account IMF and World 
Bank recommendations. 
  The deputy prime minister said that an integrated program is 
needed to revitalize the economy. The first step in this 
direction would be to free prices, since the difference in 
prices [between the public and private sectors] is mainly 
responsible for the budget deficit. Rationing could serve as a 
social protection mechanism. It is necessary to determine a 
budget deficit limit, which is to be filled with revenues from 
state property privatization. These revenues should be used to 
repay bank credits and to establish a fund to stabilize the 
financial system. The deputy prime minister stressed that the 
National Bank is to play an important role in this process. 
  The draft program produced heated debate and a fair amount 
of 
skepticism. 
  In responding to deputies' remarks regarding the further 
impoverishment of the population, the absence of social 
protection mechanisms, and the impossibility of implementing 
reforms, Deputy Prime Minister Basilia said that it had been 
much easier for him to be a member of parliament and work on 
this issue in commissions than to speak from his present vantage 
point. However, he said, it is necessary to start this process, 
since the current situation defies assessment. 
  The fact that both parliament and the government have 
discussed ways of strengthening the coupon and revitalizing the 
economy many times before gives ground for a certain degree of 
skepticism. Is it possible to implement everything mentioned 
above? Deputy Prime Minister Basilia gave us the following 
answer: 
  [Begin Basilia recording] The most difficult part of it is 
to 
make a decision and to have the political will to implement 
these measures. I am profoundly convinced that the measures 
which I presented to parliament today are the only way of 
overcoming the current economic crisis. I am not aware of any 
other ways or measures of doing it. Therefore, I think that all 
of us, both parliament and government, should work in 
coordination to implement these measures. If our work is well 
coordinated, I am sure that we will achieve some results. [end 
recording]

Information From the Chamber of Control, a Large Part of 
Humanitarian Aid Is Not Reaching Its Destination"] 
  [Text] Referring to violations connected with receiving 
and distributing humanitarian aid, Revaz Shavishvili, chairman 
of the Chamber of Control, stated today in an interview given to 
the "Alioni" [television] program that the Chamber of Control 
has simply confirmed something that was already known to the 
population. According to Shavishvili, a significant part of 
humanitarian aid given by countries to Georgia in the form of 
medicines and food products either does not leave the warehouse 
for a long period of time or, after being allocated its place of 
destination, ends up in the hands of commercial structures. As 
an example, he mentioned 58,000 ampules of insulin and two dozen 
tonnes of cheese that could no longer be used as their 
consumption date had expired. 
  Shavishvili also pointed out that, despite a multitude of 
similar facts exposed by the Chamber of Control during the 
course of recent checks, they still do not reflect the real 
state of affairs. Shavishvili believes the reason for such chaos 
lies in the lack of a single coordination center for the 
distribution of humanitarian aid.

  [Text] Dionisios Kalamvrezos, the Greek consul in Moscow, 
stated that the majority of Greeks who were evacuated during 
military actions in Abkhazia and sent to their historic homeland 
were gradually returning to their places of permanent residence. 
The Greek authorities are not preventing the return to Abkhazia 
of refugees from among their compatriots. However, they are 
demanding appropriate guarantees for their security. 
  According to figures given by the consulate, there were 
between 16,000 and 17,000 Greeks living in Abkhazia before the 
outbreak of the war. The total number remaining there today is

Zugdidi-Mestia Highway"] 
  [Text] The press service of the Georgian Ministry of 
Internal Affairs [MVD] has stated that, as a result of 
operations conducted by the police in western Georgia, the 
Zugdidi-Mestia highway has been opened up to traffic. During 
the last year and a half, it has been under the control of armed 
supporters of the ex-president [Zviad Gamsakhurdia] and local 
bandits. During all this time, food products and other goods 
were delivered to Mestia -- the center of Svanetia -- by 
helicopter. 
  Colonel Korneli Chiladze, deputy minister of internal 
affairs, is supervising measures to guard the Zugdidi-Mestia 
highway. As the MVD press service points out, a big factor in 
the success of the operation was the support given to the police 
by the local population.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 29 April (SNARK) -- The head of Georgian 
state, Eduard Shevardnadze, issued an order according to which 
the number of state-funded facilities will be reduced since the 
second quarter of 1994. The order also reads that, with purpose 
of fast transition to free prices, the state subsidiaries for 
bread, electric power and gas are planned to be cut. 
  At the same time, VAT [value-added tax], customs taxes and 
excise duty for petrol will be increased. The 8-percent tax for 
products export will be removed. Also the obligatory currency 
sale to government by the enterprises is no more valid. 
  The order, as think the government specialists, has been 
developed according to the IMF and IBRD [International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development] recommendations.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 3 May (SNARK)--Georgia spends 10 times more 
than allows the state of her economy, stated today the President 
of Georgian National Bank, Nodar Djavakhishvili, to the SNARK 
newsman. In his opinion, the introduction of a new national 
currency, lari, is now highly questionable, since even a small 
stabilization of Georgian coupon is impossible. 
  "It is impossible to exist on account of emission. We 
increase every quarter the money issue which is not secured by 
the real content, thus subjecting the people to 
hyper-inflation", said Djavakhishvili. He observed that 
"Georgian economy doesn't even compensate its expenses for gas". 
  "If so, then we should not use gas at all. By the way, 
nearly 80 percent of Georgian population actually do not use 
gas. Only Tbilisi, Rustavi, Batumi and Kutaissi receive gas", 
noted the head banker of Georgia. He also suggested that the 
Georgian Government would finally make a decision: "In the case 
Georgia goes towards the ruble zone, rather than strengthens its 
coupon, the government needs a new chairman of the National 
Bank", said Djavakhishvili.

<F P=106> [Article by IPRINDA correspondent Nana Rizhamadze: "Lost </F>
Credits?"] 
  [Text] On 20 April, Colonel Valerian Gogolashvili, head of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Center, stated in a 
conversation with an agency correspondent that there had been a 
sharp increase in economic crimes recently. In particular, 
according to Gogolashvili, the Department for the Struggle 
Against Economic Crimes is investigating a large number of facts 
connected with credits received by various firms and private 
individuals. All these processes involve serious violations. 
Under the pretext of purchasing food products, petrol, and so 
forth, firms are receiving large credits from banks (often 
through stooges). Then, these sums are transferred to other 
banks outside the republic; as a rule, these sums -- already in 
rubles and dollars -- are "pocketed" and, naturally, they are 
not used to purchase anything. In this regard, according to 
agreements concluded between the ministries of internal affairs 
of the CIS member states, power structures are carrying out 
joint work (sometimes with the involvement of Interpol) aimed at 
exposing all these facts.

the leadership of Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic headed by the 
Chairman of Supreme Majlis, Namik Gasanov, and Premier, 
Shamsaddin Khanbabayev, arrived in Ordubadskiy -- the region 
centre of the republic. 
  The People's Deputy, Khidzhran Kerimli, told TURAN that 
several "Ikarus" buses with armed policemen arrived in 
Ordubadskiy too. The same source reports that President Aliyev 
issued a decree concerning the removal of the head of Executive 
Power of Ordubadskiy, Rovshan Shafiyev (supporter of Elchibey), 
from his duties. 
  Having known about the authorities' intention, Ordubadskiy's 
citizens began to picket the building of Executive Power and 
they protested against President Aliyev's resolution. The talks 
between Nakhichevan's leadership and local authorities lasted 
for 8 hours but were failure. The population and Nakhichevan's 
powers did not agree to fulfill President Aliyev's resolution. 
After that the leadership of Autonomous Republic and policemen 
left Ordubadskiy. 
  As is known, Ordubadskiy's region of Nakhchivan is the only 
region in Azerbaijan where Abulfaz Elchibey's supporters hold 
several offices. After June events last summer Elchibey 
together with its supporters left Baku and arrived at the 
village of Keleki of Ordubadskiy region where he lives until 
now. Since that time Baku several times attempted to remove the 
head of Executive power of Ordubadskiy from his duties but those 
attempts failed.

  [Text] As we already reported, Rasul Guliyev, chairman of 
the republic's Supreme Soviet, has visited Bardinskiy and 
Geranboy [Shaumyanovskiy] rayons. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Nermine Elikhanbeyli] The 
powerful attacks launched by Armenia's armed units since 10 
April have considerably aggravated the situation in regions of 
our republic adjacent to the frontline such as in Terterskiy, 
Geramboy, and Bardinskiy. 
  The visit of Rasul Guliyev, speaker of parliament, to 
Bardinskiy and Geranboy rayons was linked to the existing 
sociopolitical situation. 
  During a short meeting at the Bardinskiy Rayon executive 
administration, in which Deputy Prime Minister Ali Takhmazov 
[name and title as received], and Defense Minister Mamedrafi 
Mamedov also took part, the situation in the region was 
discussed and the necessary instructions were issued. It became 
clear that compared to our fighting sons, the number of 
deserters who flee from the frontlines and are engaged in 
destructive activity in the cities is not small. 
  During the meeting at the Geranboy Rayon administration 
building, the region's problems were discussed. The necessary 
instructions were issued for a speedy solution to the problems. 
  After familiarizing himself with the refugees' living 
conditions in Barda, the chairman of the republic's Supreme 
Soviet, Rasul Guliyev said: 
  [Guliyev] The situation is very grave, because Azerbaijan is 
alone in this struggle. We must state this openly and face it. 
That is, there is no other state that will give much support to 
the Azerbaijan state and people. 
  You know who is helping the Armenians. This is a known fact. 
That is, it is impossible that the Armenian Armed Forces could 
be so superior to the Azerbaijani Armed Forces. In my opinion, 
this is impossible. Also, the economic potential of the 
Armenians does not make it possible for them to wage a prolonged 
war against us. But, undoubtedly, there are many who provide 
support to the Armenians. Armenia has a powerful diaspora. 
Though the Armenians are dispersed all over the world, they 
keep in touch with each other. There is a certain uniting party 
among the Armenians living outside Armenia and in Armenia. All 
these are facts. In addition, there are other forces who 
support the Armenians and give them arms and military hardware. 
  Therefore, Azerbaijan is now in a grave, dangerous 
situation. 
To be more correct, Azerbaijan has no strength (?now). 
Azerbaijan has been in a terribly grave condition for the last 
six years. Ways should be sought to extricate ourselves from 
this situation. That is, this cannot go on like this for long. 
  Therefore, my personal efforts of late have been directed at 
solving this problem peacefully. And this is how it could be 
solved peacefully: There should be a cease-fire, and after that 
the Armed Forces of Armenia and Daghlyk-Karabakh 
[Nagorno-Karabakh] should withdraw to the present borders of 
Daghlyk-Karabakh. That is, they should leave Azerbaijani lands. 
After that, a certain zone -- this is known as [words 
indistinct] zone -- should be created between the armed forces 
of Daghlyk-Karabakh and Azerbaijani Armed Forces. International 
observers and international armed forces should be stationed in 
this zone. 
  After this stage, our refugees should return to their own 
homes. And, only after that will we start talks on the so-called 
status of Daghlyk-Karabakh. I consider this to be the optimal 
path because it preserves the [words indistinct]. All these 
developments will be completed within 35 to 40 days. That is, 
if we begin the cease-fire today, the Armenians must leave our 
lands within 35 to 40 days. We are taking steps in this 
direction. 
  [Elikhanbeyli] The chairman of the parliament also met with 
the officers and soldiers of the military unit. 
  [Guliyev] In recent days I was in Moscow. We have to solve 
this problem peacefully. We will solve it peacefully. That is, 
the war cannot go on for long. The war is having disastrous 
consequences for the Azerbaijani people. I am sure that you 
will not abandon even an inch of land to the enemy. 
  [Elikhanbeyli] The head of the parliament returned to Baku 
yesterday. [end recording]

  [Text] The Defense Ministry press service reported that 
relative calm has been prevailing all along the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani border since last night. No incidents are 
reported. 
  The picture is different in Nagorno-Karabakh. The active 
military operations continued unceasingly yesterday and last 
night on the northern and northeastern sectors of the front. 
The press service of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] 
Defense Army headquarters reports that the battles in these 
sectors continued in the areas of Talysh and Karmiravan in 
Mardakertskiy Rayon. NKR defense units managed to halt the 
Azerbaijani side's offensives and forced them to retreat to 
their initial positions. 
  The same source reports that relative calm prevailed all 
along the confrontation line this morning. We have not received 
any further information on the situation since then.

  [Text] Hostilities resumed at daybreak today in the area of 
the Karabakh conflict after a relative lull lasting one day. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent has been told by the Karabakh 
army's press service that Azeri troops supported by armor 
attempted to break though the defensive lines of the Karabakh 
forces in the northeast, in the Agdam sector. After a 90-minute 
long battle, all the attacks of the Azeri side were repelled, 
the press service noted. According to the source, the Azeris 
sustained significant losses in manpower and were forced to 
retreat to their initial positions. There were no losses on the 
Karabakh side. 
  According to reports from Stepanakert, the headquarters of 
the Karabakh army is receiving information about a massive 
concentration of Azeri troops and combat hardware in the north 
of Mardakertskiy Rayon.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Vinogradov: "Shooting Continues in </F>
Karabakh Conflict Zone"] 
  [Text] There is every indication that Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev's threats of abandoning involvement in 
settling the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict if the warring sides 
continue fighting are having little effect. Contrary to 
expectations calm did not prevail on all fronts 29 April. 
  As you know, Baku was the first to respond to Russia's 
cease-fire initiative. Azerbaijani Defense Minister Mamedrafi 
Mamedov agreed 26 April to suspend combat operations and begin 
talks. It took Nagorno-Karabakh three days to come up with an 
affirmative response. In a letter to Pavel Grachev, Andrey 
Kozyrev, and Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian president's special 
representative, Karabakh Foreign Minister Samvel Babayan said 
that troops have been ordered not to fire. 
  A truce has not been secured. There is still no official 
document. Whereas Azerbaijan is being guided by the Russian 
plan, which talks about curtailing offensive operations and the 
use of heavy artillery for shelling and aerial bombardment, 
Stepanakert is acting on the basis of the 18 February protocol 
signed in Moscow. This envisages a cease-fire applicable to all 
categories of weapons. 
  Over the next few days a unified document is expected to be 
signed, guaranteed by representatives of Russia and the CSCE's 
Minsk Group. But for the time being the conflicting sides are 
accusing one another of intending to use the peaceful respite to 
regroup their forces and prepare for another assault. Over the 
last few days the Karabakh troops have had some success in the 
northern sector, penetrating several kilometers into Azerbaijan. 
Baku is demanding that troops be withdrawn from the captured 
areas, which by and large accords with the Russian plan. 
  There is a dual attitude to this document. Geydar Aliyev 
supported it by and large, but is pressing for "certain 
finishing touches." Yerevan agrees with the main provisions of 
the draft, but claims that it does not have decisive influence 
over Stepanakert. We were told by the Russian Foreign Ministry 
that painstaking work still lies ahead in order to close the gap 
between their positions. An Azerbaijani parliament delegation 
led by Speaker Rasul Guliyev is holding consultations with the 
Russian leadership. Experts led by the Swedish diplomat Matias 
Mosberg [name as transliterated], head of the CSCE Minsk group 
on Nagorno-Karabakh, have traveled out to the frontline area. 
  He described the Russian plan as the "most realistic," 
singling out such points as the liberation of Azerbaijan's 
conquered territory and the creation of a joint staff to 
supervise the implementation of commitments.

  [Text] Riga, 3 May, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima (parliament) 
Legal Committee passed for the second reading in plenary session 
a draft law on storage and disposal of Soviet security service 
archives. 
  The committee wants the bill to be considered on Thursday [5 
May], said its head Aivars Endzins. 
  After the third reading, the law could take effect 27 or 28 
May, Endzins prognosticated. 
  The law would be used to test the alleged KGB collaboration 
of five MPs, among them Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs and 
Minister for Special Tasks Edvins Inkens. 
  The committee supplemented the bill with rights for defense 
lawyer and the order of appeal. 
  If the court finds that the deputies were KGB operatives, 
their mandates will be nullified and the ruling can be regarded 
as basis to break work or service relations. 
  The fact that the deputies were mentioned in KGB files alone 
does not testify about their collaboration because information 
on results of cooperation is lacking.

  [Text] The newspaper "DIENA" reports that the Latvian 
Foreign Minister, Georgs Andrejevs, giving a telephone interview 
denied the charge with collaboration with KGB and said he is not 
going to resign if the government does not demand it. To his 
mind the drive launched against him and the other four deputies 
of the Saeima [parliament] iconvemint [as received] to some 
political forces interested in the breakdown of signing the 
agreements with Russia, in a complete split of the ruling 
coalition and destabilization in the government. He reiterated 
that his main speciality is an anesthesiologist and as a chief 
expert in this branch he had to regularly provide accounts of 
what was going on at the conferences abroad to the Health Care 
Ministry. He assumed that the so-called first department of the 
ministry possibly passed his accounts to KGB and denied the 
reports of his resignation which have appeared in the press. 
Andrejevs said that before leaving for his vacation he had 
handed over a confidential letter to the Prime Minister where he 
expressed his personal views on the possibility to stabilize the 
internal political situation and on the activities of the 
government linked to the signing of the agreements, and 
mentioned the change of the foreign minister as an absolutely 
theoretical possibility.

<F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "Law on Civil Service Adopted"] </F>
  [Text] Riga, 21 Apr -- Today, Saeima [parliament] adopted, 
in its third reading, the long-expected law on state civil 
service, which is to regulate relations of the civil servants, 
as well as candidates for this post, in state and municipal 
civil institutions. In accordance with the transformation 
regulations of the new law, the reform of the state 
administration has to be completed by 31 December 1995. 
  The transformation regulations of the law foresee that the 
Cabinet of Ministers, along with the municipal authorities and 
heads of civil institutions are to bear responsibility for 
implementing the reform in due course. The transformation 
regulations provide that the reform is implemented in a 
respective sequence of time. The first stage of the reform will 
be carried into effect in the ministries (except the Ministry of 
Interior Affairs and the State Forest Service in the Agriculture 
Ministry), and the state institutions which are submitted to 
them, by 31 December of the current year. 
  The second stage of the reform of the state administration 
will take place in the Ministry of Interior Affairs, the State 
Forest Service, and the institutions of municipal authorities, 
and will have to be implemented by 31 December 1995. 
  To ensure a proper course of transformation, the Cabinet of 
Ministers will affirm the list of the civil servant positions 
available in the state civil service. The employees will be 
attestated by attestation commissions. 
  As is stated by the civil service law, the following are 
state civil institutions: the State Office, all state 
administration and municipal institutions, court and 
prosecutor's institutions, State Control institutions, as well 
as other institutions acting as state or municipal authorities, 
established in accordance with the Satversme [constitution], 
legislative acts, and decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers. As 
regards the civil servant, it is a person who has passed an 
examination qualifying him as a state civil servant, and has 
been nominated, for a definite or indefinite time, to some post 
defined on the list of civil service positions. According to the 
law, he performs the duties, which have been delegated by the 
state to the municipal authorities, or fulfills functions of the 
state civil service in a civil institution. 
  The law states that the posts of the chairman of the High 
Court, his deputies, and judges of the High Court, the chairman 
of the district court, his deputies, and judges of the district 
court, as well as judges of other courts, the posts of the 
general prosecutor and other prosecutors, the posts of the state 
controller and members of the State Control Council are not to 
be regarded as civil servant posts. 
  The law provides that the candidates for the posts of civil 
servants should meet obligatory requirements, such as, to 
possess Latvian citizenship, and to have a command of the 
Latvian language. The law denies the possibility to become a 
civil servant to a person who has been an employee of the former 
USSR or LAtvian SSR State Security Committee, the Russian 
Defense Ministry, as well as security service, intelligence 
service, and military espionage or counterespionage of Russia or 
other states. The transformation rules also provide that 
foreign citizens and stateless persons, who are performing 
duties of civil servants at the moment when the law comes into 
effect, are permitted --after passing the attestation 
examinations due to regulations adopted by the Cabinet of 
Ministers -- to function in the status of candidates for the 
post of civil servant, for a time not longer than two years.

  [Text] The Presidents of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are 
meeting at the Latvian resort of Jurmala today. The agenda of 
the presidents' closed meeting includes: the Russian-Latvian 
agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops and future policy 
toward Russia, the Polish-Lithuanian treaty on good-neighborly 
relations, and other political matters. 
  The presidents will meet in private without even their 
advisers present. A Baltic News Service correspondent learned 
in Jurmala, where the presidents are holding the meeting, that 
they are not going to hold a news conference, although a joint 
statement could be released. 
  Final arrangements for the meeting and the topics for 
discussion were made by Presidents Guntis Ulmanis, Algirdas 
Brazauskas, and Lennart Meri by phone yesterday. 
  The meeting was provisionally planned for an earlier date, 
but it was decided to hold it following the visit to Moscow by 
Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimiras Zarovskis: "Love Story"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Vilnius -- Polish President Lech Walesa has 
paid a visit to Lithuania. It is several centuries since there 
have been visitors of this kind here. The burden of history 
weighed heavy on the leaders of the two states. [passage 
omitted] 
  But there now seem to be signs of change. 
  Lech Walesa unexpectedly proved more peaceable than Algirdas 
Brazauskas. In his speech the former spoke about the future. 
While the latter engaged in diplomatic license: "Even now 
Lithuania is not abandoning its principled position that Vilnius 
and the Vilnius region only belonged to Poland between the wars 
de facto but not de jure, and in 1939 Vilnius and the 
neighboring territory was legally returned to Lithuania." This 
statement was made in order to gratify his opponents who are 
demanding that the fact of the Poles' occupation of part of 
Lithuania's territory be recognized. 
  Nevertheless, a Polish-Lithuanian treaty was nevertheless. 
The main point therein being recognition of the inviolability 
of borders and the legality of the capitals "regardless of past 
borders." That is, Poland has officially renounced its claims 
to Vilnius and the Vilnius region and Lithuania has officially 
secured its right to them. This can be seen as a great success 
for Lithuanian diplomacy. 
  Lech Walesa's visit occurred without any excesses. That may 
have been facilitated by his calm firm position: He has 
repeatedly told Poles living in Lithuania that Lithuania is 
their homeland, while Poland is their motherland. 
  Thus, the centuries-long misunderstanding between Lithuania 
and Poland is being resolved. Lech Walesa said that by the year 
2000, Polish-Lithuanian borders will cease to exist, and 
Lithuanian Poles, indignant that Lithuanians have stopped 
relaying Polish television, have been advised to simply buy 
satellite dishes. Petty thieves celebrated this remarkable date 
in their own way: They stole the Lithuanian interior minister's 
official Mercedes in broad daylight.

  [Text] Vilnius, 3 May, BNS -- The Lithuanian Union of 
Nationalists on 2 May registered its initiative group and began 
collecting signatures under a demand to hold early parliamentary 
elections. 
  In its address to the people of Lithuania, the initiative 
group said early elections "is the only way to stop the 
pernicious governing of the LDDP (ruling Lithuanian Democratic 
Labor Party)" and to bring honest, competent and determined 
people to power. 
  To achieve its goal, the union has to collect 300,000 
signatures in two months. The union's representative in 
parliament MP Leonas Milcius told reporters Monday [2 May] that 
the nationalists hope to collect signatures and to hold a 
referendum together with the Conservative Party, which earlier 
started collecting signatures for a referendum on unlawful 
privatization and compensation of savings. 
  So far, the union's initiative received support only from 
the 
Democratic Party. The nationalists and the democrats have six 
seats in the parliament. 
  A representative of the Democratic Party declined to comment 
on the passiveness of the conservatives and the Christian 
Democrats, but noted that "an observer status is not the best 
way out." 
  The Nationalist Union expects early elections to take place 
in February-March next year. The organizers said their are not 
worried by the results of public opinion polls, which suggest 
continuing popularity of leftist forces. "A greater part of the 
nation will come to reason."

<F P=106> [Report by Ceslovas Skarzinskas: "The Peasant Party Is </F>
Emerging in Vilnius, While Farmland Is Being Ploughed in 
Dzukija..."] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Last Saturday [16 April], 
the Lithuanian Union of Peasants held its second congress in the 
assembly hall of the Ministry of Agriculture. This is, 
probably, the oldest political and social organization of 
Lithuanian peasants, which will celebrate its 90th anniversary 
next year. Having emerged during the czarist times, the 
Lithuanian Union of Peasants was a powerful party: It 
participated in the government and successfully resolved 
agrarian problems. 
  The restored Union of Peasants currently unites 420 members. 
Certainly, it is not numerous, and it almost does not stand out 
among other agrarian organizations. Speaking about the period 
under review at the party's congress, Professor Petras Becius, 
chairman of the Lithuanian Union of Peasants, said primarily 
that the assets of rural people have almost been wasted, that 
weeds are growing in many fields, and that food processing 
enterprises are indebted to land workers. The professor, as 
well as subsequent speakers at the congress, criticized the 
government which is doing little to improve the situation in 
agriculture. One of the most critical speeches was delivered by 
Professor Ksaveras Purvinskas. "Recently," he said, "rumors 
have been spreading that Lithuania does not need agriculture, 
and that the latter is supported from the budget." At the same 
time, the professor provided the following figures: If the 
state procured agrarian produce from peasants for world prices, 
the latter would earn even 2.5 million litai per year. 
Therefore, said K. Purvinskas, they would not have to beg from 
the state. 
  It is difficult to say where such statistics come from. One 
thing is clear -- the produce of the Lithuanian agriculture is 
overly expensive for consumers today. It is not accidental that 
food exports must be continuously increased. The government is 
doing its best to protect its own land workers. The delegates 
in the congress may not or do not want to know this. They 
should look for ways of getting out of this quagmire. Professor 
K. Purvinskas also acknowledged this. It is necessary to 
upgrade the cattle stock anew and produce a larger crop. Is it 
normal that in most agrarian companies the annual milk yield of 
cows does not reach even 3,000 kg, or that fertile soil produces 
only 20 quintals of grain [per hectare]? This used to be the 
case during the first years of collective farming. [passage 
omitted] 
  Professor K. Purvinskas termed the government's program for 
developing agriculture a "program for fooling land workers." 
"Peasants have no other alternative than to unite in this 
party," he said in conclusion. According to the professor, 
neither rightists nor leftists have yet resolved agrarian 
problems. 
  Many contradictory ideas were voiced at the congress. For 
example, the law on two-three hectare land plots was discussed 
extensively. Petras Becius said in his report that the party 
categorically speaks out against this law. However, Albinas 
Albertynas, member of the Lithuanian Union of peasants, who 
addressed the congress later, emphasized the pressing nature of 
this law. People are looking forward to the legalization of 
these two or three hectares. A. Albertynas berated the party 
program. According to him, such a program will not lead them to 
power. 
  In general, the congress defended the interests of 
landowners. As the delegates themselves admitted, however, 
presently there are about 180,000 families whose parents or 
grandparents did not possess any land before 1940. Those two or 
three hectares are a source of subsistence for such families. 
The Peasant Party proposes that the land which these families 
have been working be granted to them free of charge. However, 
another clause in the program as if cuts this proposal -- in the 
first place, land must be unconditionally restored to 
descendants of former owners! Thus, if this occurred, 180,000 
families, whose parents were landless, would not receive those 
two or three hectares, because there is a shortage of land in 
Lithuania. [passage omitted] 
  The congress of the Lithuanian Union of Peasants devoted the 
most of time to the difficult situation in agriculture, which, 
incidentally, is no secret to every citizen. Both rightists and 
leftists were scolded for this. Thus, the party is likely to 
adhere to the centrist position. 
  It is difficult to say how this organization, which on 
Saturday changed its name into the Lithuanian Peasant Party, 
will manage to attract rural people to its ranks. Will the 
latter approve of its program and vote for its representatives 
in the new elections? There is only one issue that bothers land 
workers today -- how to sow and plant this spring. In other 
words, how to survive. One could become convinced of that on 
the same day of the congress. 
  The congress elected Seimas [parliament] deputy Albinas 
Vaizmuzis, who does not belong to any faction, chairman of the 
Lithuanian Peasant Party. Petras Becius, Stanislovas 
Liucvaitis, and Ksaveras Purvinskas were elected his deputies. 
The congress also elected the council and executive committee 
of the party. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vilnius, 3 May, BNS -- The introduction of the 
value-added tax in Lithuania 1 May was not as smooth as expected 
by the government. 
  The 18-percent tax replaced the equal size general excise 
tax, however apart from being applied to local products, the new 
tax was also imposed on imports. 
  As soon as the new tax came into effect, the usual routine 
was disrupted at Lithuanian customs offices. Not knowing how to 
apply the new value-added tax law, customs officers simply 
stopped all cargoes on the border. Vitalijus Girzonas, head of 
the Lithuanian Customs Department, said lines of trucks have 
become even longer at the Lazdijai crossing on the 
Lithuanian-Polish border because a number of companies failed to 
bring goods into the country before 1 May. 
  Ignorance of the value-added tax law created additional 
problems for tax inspectors, who are unable to answer all 
questions asked about the new tax. 
  Experts of the European Union's PHARE [Poland-Hungary Action 
for Restructuring Economy] program came to Lithuania around a 
month ago to help prepare for the introduction of the new tax. 
PHARE experts provided a considerable amount of information 
about the tax to the public, but the desired result was not 
achieved. 
  Forecasts of the expected price-leap are quite controversial 
and range from 3 to 20 percent. Drivers were first to 
experience the new tax when gasoline prices jumped by as much as 
25 percent in some gas stations. 
  The reaction of store owners varied. Prices did not change 
at a majority of stores in Vilnius, although salespeople said 
imported goods may become more expensive very soon. But nearly 
all stores changed prices and were closed Monday in the second 
biggest town of Kaunas. Virtually all store owners agree that 
sales will drop. 
  Lithuanian industrialists said the value-added tax will 
scare 
away foreign investments, although the authors of the 
value-added tax law contend that the tax will stimulate the 
investment process.

  [Text] The top Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong, Lu 
Ping, yesterday broke his silence over his refusal to meet the 
Governor Chris Patten, saying the atmosphere was not good enough 
to facilitate a fruitful exchange. 
  In his first public speech since arriving on Sunday, Mr. Lu 
said China and Britain had to iron out their differences through 
meetings at various levels before the two sat down for talks. 
  Chinese officials had previously suggested Mr. Lu could not 
meet Mr. Patten because the director was too busy. 
  Noting that the Government had barred civil servants from 
contacts with the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), the 
China- appointed working panel for the Special Administrative 
Region, Mr. Lu said the atmosphere remained bad. 
  "The Hong Kong Government has not been very friendly towards 
the PWC," he said. "If the situation is like that, a meeting 
between us will bear no fruit. 
  "Thus, it will be better to start the negotiations at the 
lower level. When discussions at those forums manage to 
progress, then we shall meet to see if we can achieve something 
at this level," said Mr. Lu, director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office. 
  He said the two countries were continuing their discussions 
about the transition of Hong Kong via the Airport Committee and 
the Sino- British Joint Liaison Group (JLG). 
  "I believe that we can reach an airport proposal acceptable 
to both sides soon," Mr. Lu said. "The questions related to the 
financing arrangement and the legislation on the airport 
management authority are both under discussion. I hope there 
will be a quick agreement." 
  Mr. Lu sidestepped a question as to whether his refusal to 
meet Mr. Patten was in breach of the 1991 memorandum of 
understanding on the new airport and related issues. "I came to 
Hong Kong as the deputy director and secretary-general of the 
PWC to participate in the meetings of political and economic 
sub-groups," he said. 
  Under the memorandum, the director and the Governor should 
hold regular meetings. Mr. Lu refused to say when he would meet 
Mr. Patten. "I hope sometime in the future, when there is a 
better atmosphere." 
  PWC member Raymond Wu Wai-yung defended Mr. Lu's decision to 
snub Mr. Patten. He said China had to send a clear signal to 
Britain that Beijing would not bow to pressure. 
  Meanwhile, it was confirmed yesterday that Sino-British 
defence experts would meet again next week to resolve the 
outstanding problems of a draft accord on the disposal of 
military land. The meeting of the JLG would be held from May 10 
to May 13, the Government said. 
  Next week's session is crucial, because a successful outcome 
will facilitate the confirmation of a final agreement in the 
upcoming plenum of the JLG to be held in Hong Kong this month.

  [Text] Lu Ping, China's top official for Hong Kong, will 
meet Heung Yee Kuk representatives tomorrow to discuss the New 
Territories inheritance row. 
  Lu, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, 
will discuss how to introduce Basic Law provisions which 
stipulate protection of the rights and customs of indigenous 
residents in the New Territories, according to sources. His 
meeting will be seen as a gesture of support for the indigenous 
residents locked in a bitter row with the Government over a 
proposal by a legislator, Christine Loh, to give New Territories 
women inheritance rights. 
  It is understood that Lu will discuss internal matters of 
the 
Kuk, the Government's rural advisory body on New Territories' 
affairs. Lu, who last year told members of the Federation of 
Women he supported equal inheritance rights for indigenous 
women, has recently publicly condemned government plans to 
support Loh's amendment. 
  Lu has threatened the New Territories (Land) (Exemption) 
Bill 
would be scrapped in 1997. Yesterday, the vice-chairman of the 
Kuk, Daniel Lam, said he had not yet received confirmation of 
the meeting. Lam said it would be good for the Kuk to have the 
opportunity to meet Lu to put the views of indigenous people. 
  He said if they were to meet Lu, he would want to talk about 
the land exemption bill and the impact of the adoption of the 
United Nations' anti sex-discrimination convention, Cedaw, on 
the indigenous community. The Government is now finalising 
recommendations to the Executive Council on the extension of 
Cedaw to Hong Kong, which are set to affect discriminatory 
practices against New Territories women. A formal announcement 
is expected to be made this month. Women's rights campaigners 
will stage an anti- feudalism rally outside the Kuk offices 
today to protest against objections to grant rural women equal 
rights of inheritance. 
  The protest outside the Kuk headquarters in Kowloon Tong 
will 
be linked to the May 4 movement in China where tens of thousands 
of students marched in Beijing on May 4, 1919 to oppose 
oppressive feudal traditions. Lam said he welcomed the 
opportunity to exchange views with the women's groups and said 
the Kuk supported sexual equality, but said it should not be 
rolled into the inheritance debate.

<F P=106> [Report by Political Editor Danny Gittings and Queenie Wang] </F>
  [Text] When Lu Ping, China's chief of Hong Kong affairs, 
arrives tonight, it will be into a territory that members of his 
immediate family know intimately. Both his wife and son have 
worked for various Hong Kong companies for years, and have easy 
access to the territory's top businessmen and community leaders. 
Their combined knowledge of the territory may give some the 
impression that they are a conduit of information for Mr Lu, who 
has not visited the territory for the past two years because of 
the row over Chris Patten's political reforms. However, a close 
look at the relationship suggests this is unlikely to be the 
case. 
  Mr Lu's wife, Xi Liang, has worked in Hong Kong since 1985, 
while his son, Kenneth Lu Gong, has been employed by a string of 
Hong Kong companies. As China's most senior official on Hong 
Kong affairs, Mr Lu makes it his business to know what is going 
on here -- yet his absence from Hong Kong has made this 
difficult. Neither his wife nor son will be at Hung Hom station 
to greet him when his train arrives from Guangzhou. Some 
suggest the Lu family has grown apart. Others say their absence 
is purely a coincidence. 
  According to colleagues, Ms Xi deputy general manager of 
China International Trade and Investment Corporation (Hong 
Kong), is currently on the mainland on business, believed to be 
using her engineering background to oversee the construction of 
new power plants. Ms Xi, 65, works from a plush office in The 
Landmark, and is not expected back in Hong Kong until the middle 
of the month, according to her secretary. A frequent traveller 
to the mainland, she was also away during her husband's last 
Hong Kong visit, in early 1992. Like many other mainland 
couples of their generation, they work apart and rarely see each 
other, leaving little scope for Hong Kong businessmen to win 
favours from Mr Lu by pampering his wife. 
  The younger Lu has worked for a number of Hong Kong 
companies. He is currently employed by Li Kashing's Cheung Kong. 
Previous employers include the Sino Land property group, headed 
by Robert Ng Chee-siong, and Shell Hong Kong. Mr Lu began 
working for Cheung Kong at the beginning of the year. And 
although he is based in Beijing, his value to Hong Kong 
companies comes through his connections with other influential 
sons of senior Chinese leaders -- the so-called "princelings". 
Besides frequent job changes, the younger Mr Lu has had a 
troubled personal life in recent years. His first wife divorced 
him after she was sent to work in Paris. He remarried last 
year. Those seeking favours from his father's office through 
the younger Mr Lu have little chance of success. "The old man 
would never allow it," said a friend of Mr Lu for 40 years. 
"He's very strict about not using personal connections to win 
favours and gets very angry when anything like that comes up." 
  With so many Hong Kong people wanting to see the elder Mr 
Lu, 
from the Governor down, the absence of his family will probably 
be overlooked. Mr Lu is not the kind of person to let family 
matters mar the important visit. The trip, originally expected 
to last only until Friday, will now continue until April 9. 
Despite the extension, which will give him more time to meet 
people, he will not visit the Governor. A visit by any Chinese 
official to Mr Patten, once dubbed by Mr Lu as a "man of guilt 
for 1,000 years", with the reforms row still unresolved would be 
seen in Beijing as completely impolitic. It would also run into 
opposition from local XINHUA (NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) chief Zhou 
Nan. 
  Forgetting the people Mr Lu will not see in Hong Kong, he is 
still in for a busy time -- and it will not all be pleasant. 
From the moment his train from Guangzhou pulls in at 7 pm, Mr 
Lu and his entourage of 23 aides and mainland Preliminary 
Working Committee members will be the target of protests. 
Operation Save Xi Yang, an umbrella organisation campaigning 
for the release of the jailed MING PAO journalist, is organising 
a major demonstration to mark Mr Lu's arrival. A small radical 
group, Kick Out The PWC, is also planning a protest. Two 
car-loads of Special Branch and XINHUA bodyguards will whisk Mr 
Lu -- and secretary Liu Zhenxin -- past the protesters as he 
leaves Hung Hom for Mr Zhou's villa in Stanley Beach Road, his 
base during the visit. Friends say Mr Lu dislikes the Stanley 
villa, regarding it as too far out of town, although that will 
not deter demonstrators who intend to camp outside while he is 
in residence. Its choice for this visit has already sparked 
speculation of a tacit agreement with Mr Zhou that the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office director will stay out of the spotlight 
this time around. Also accompanying Mr Lu will be top Hong Kong 
affairs officials Wang Fengchao, Xu Ze, and Zhang Liangdong. 
  Mr Lu's first meeting, a gathering of the Preliminary 
Working 
Committee political sub-group, will be held tomorrow in the Bank 
of China Building. This will be followed by a 6 pm ceremony on 
the 17th floor to mark the issuing of the Bank of China's first 
Hong Kong dollar banknotes, at which Mr Lu will rub shoulders 
with minor government officials, such as Monetary Authority 
Chief Executive Joseph Yam Chi-kwong. While these two events 
have been widely presented as the reason for Mr Lu's trip, in 
reality they are little more than a politically convenient 
excuse. During the past year, Mr Lu had made it clear to 
friends that ordinarily he could not return to the territory 
until the political reform row was resolved. 
  The idea of holding PWC sub group meetings in Hong Kong is 
nothing new. Local members, tired of flying to Beijing almost 
every month, have long recommended it as a chance for mainland 
officials to enjoy closer consultation with the local community. 
But the decision to make this week's sub-group meeting the 
first to be held in the territory appears to be politically 
motivated. Although the last session discussed the sensitive 
subject of the civil service, controversially concluding that 
all 180,000 public employees should be asked if they wished to 
remain after the handover, it was nonetheless held in Beijing. 
  "This (the plan to hold the latest meeting in Hong Kong) 
will boost the importance of the Preliminary Working Committee," 
said Professor Lau Siu-kai, an academic and political sub-group 
member. "The symbolic meaning of Mr Lu's visit is more 
important than the subject of the meeting." He said the visit 
showed Beijing had given up all hope of co-operating with 
Britain, and would now concentrate on winning support in the 
local community, a point repeatedly stressed by Chinese leaders 
in recent months. Professor Lau also claimed a meeting with the 
Governor would send out the wrong signals. "Pictures of Mr Lu 
shaking hands with Mr Patten would be misleading to Hong Kong 
people," he said. "This ... might be used by Mr Patten to 
`prove' his strategy is correct; that China's angry reaction to 
his (political) reform proposals is only temporary." 
  The political sub-group meeting which ends on Tuesday, will 
be followed by a session of its economic counterpart. It is not 
yet clear if Mr Lu will attend the meeting, scheduled for 
Wednesday and Thursday. He has skipped several in the past. 
However he will lunch with members on Thursday. Much of his 
remaining time is expected to be spent pursuing the united front 
strategy in meetings with local leftists. Many have already 
been invited to a cocktail reception at the China Resources 
Building in Wan Chai on Tuesday. Some Hong Kong Affairs advisers 
have also requested a separate session with him, and a dinner -- 
with, as yet, unknown guests -- has been arranged for Thursday 
at the Hilton hotel. The Heung Yee Kuk, which is seeking 
support in its battle with the Government over New Territories 
land rights, is also likely to see him. As on previous visits, 
Mr Lu will visit the Kowloon headquarters of the 170,000-strong 
Federation of Trade Unions, China's main grassroots supporter in 
Hong Kong. This is scheduled for next Sunday. 
  But Mr Lu's expected emphasis on meetings with Beijing's 
hard- core supporters, rather than more representative members 
of the community, has already sparked criticism from one local 
leftist. Maverick National People's Congress (NPC) delegate Liu 
Yiu-chu called on the pro-Beijing camp to step back and allow Mr 
Lu time to meet ordinary Hong Kong people. "This time the NPC 
delegates Chinese People's Political Consultation Conference 
delegates and Hong Kong Affairs advisers should not fight for 
meetings with Mr Lu because we already have many opportunities 
and channels to convey our opinions to him," she said. "This 
opportunity should be left to other Hong Kong people." Ms Liu 
said the territory's delegates and advisers numbered only a few 
hundred and could hardly claim to represent Hong Kong's 
population of six million.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with recently released Chinese </F>
dissident Wang Juntao by unidentified reporters for EASTWEEK 
magazine -- owned by the Oriental Press Group, which also owns 
EASTERN EXPRESS -- in New York on 3 May: "`Why Do They Keep on 
Hounding Us?'"] 
  [Text] Just 10 days after his release from a Chinese 
prison for his role in organising the 1989 pro-democracy 
movement, Wang Juntao, one of China's most prominent dissidents, 
remains unrepentant. Five hard years behind bars for a crime he 
has repeatedly denied have taken their toll on his health. His 
serious hepatitis condition shows through his yellowed eyes. 
But his spirit has not been broken. He is chatty, often 
enthusiastic in offering views on various aspects of the Chinese 
government, talks of his time in prison, and more importantly, 
of the love of his life his 30-year-old wife. 
  Coming from a military family, Wang, 35, is nothing short of 
the character expected -- disciplined, patriotic and courageous. 
Throughout the interview, he is forthcoming with his feelings on 
China, but cautious when questions touch upon his comrades. 
  For years while he was in jail, Wang was refused treatment 
for his hepatitis condition. It was only after his wife 
travelled to more than 10 countries, rallying support from 
various heads of state and numerous international democracy 
groups, that Wang was finally released. During the interview, 
Wang repeatedly turned to Hou, looking into her eyes and smiling 
affectionately, grateful for her strong belief in him and her 
efforts to have him released. 
  Wang still calls his wife "little girl", an affectionate 
nickname -- possibly given to her because of her petite size 
when they first met at a party in Wuhan in 1986. To him, Hou is 
still a little girl -- but with a big character and immeasurable 
courage. Because of his little girl's political rallying 
worldwide, the ailing Wang was released on April 23, and arrived 
in the United States after China agreed to allow him to go 
overseas for medical treatment, a face- saving practice often 
used by China to release dissidents when it bows to 
international pressure. 
  Wang, however, denied that he was allowed to go overseas 
purely for medical treatment. It was all a plot to satisfy 
Beijing's selfish interests, he insisted. "I was not allowed to 
go, I was ordered to leave my homeland. That is the real truth. 
  "I remember that morning on April 18 when three senior 
judiciary officers came and told me that I would be allowed to 
go after repeated requests from the US government and after 
careful consideration by the Chinese government. It was decided 
I had better leave for treatment overseas." 
  Wang's first tearful reaction was: "I don't want to leave my 
country." He then pleaded with them to allow him to remain in 
the country, putting him on parole so that he could get medical 
treatment outside the prison. The officials replied: 
"Definitely not. If you do not agree to go to the US you will 
remain in jail with no treatment." He finally agreed. 
  Wang recalled that this was the first time he cried -- he 
just could not bear the thought of leaving his homeland, 
regardless of the difficult situation he was in. Even the 
harshest conditions in prison, and the pain he suffered during 
his 21 hunger strikes could not force him to cry. "I smiled 
every time I went on a hunger strike. I was not sad because I 
knew I was doing the right thing," he said. 
  Wang described himself as a patriotic Chinese, but admitted 
he could never understand the government. "I cannot understand 
why the Chinese government keeps on hounding its people and 
keeps on treating us like enemies. And why are we being chased 
out of the country? 
  "How come every time we are in trouble, we need other 
countries and other people to step in to rescue us?" 
  Wang denounced China for repeatedly using Chinese dissidents 
as political pawns to fulfil its trade interests, and above all 
to win Most Favoured Nation trading status from the US. "This 
practice should be stopped. They should not continue with this 
shamelessly. The Americans are trying to use MFN to help solve 
problems in China, but our government is using it to fulfil its 
MFN dream," he said. "This is equal to selling out the whole of 
the Chinese race. China needs to rethink its policy towards its 
people and should treat us fairly if it still cares about 
national dignity." 
  Surprisingly, Wang refused to blame his ill health on the 
poor prison conditions he lived in and the fact that he was 
denied proper medical treatment for hepatitis. But his prison 
life was undeniably harsh and lonely. "The first cell I was put 
in was less than three square metres. There was a bucket which 
served as my private toilet, and for companionship I had dozens 
of flies buzzing around all day and all night long, along with 
hundreds of insects and various species of worms. It wasn't all 
that solitary a confinement after all," he joked. 
  Wang's mental and physical condition have surprised a great 
many people, including his wife and friends. Many anticipated 
he would be completely broken after six months in prison. Wang 
proved them wrong. But even he admits it was incredible that he 
survived such harsh conditions. He hopes his fellow dissidents 
who are still in prison will be better treated, and he called 
for improved medical treatment for the sick. 
  According to Chinese law, any prisoner who has served one 
third of a jail term can be allowed medical treatment outside 
prison. In Wang's case, his request was repeatedly turned down. 
In the US, Wang is receiving free medical examinations, but he 
has yet to find money for the expensive treatment. Still, he 
insists he does not want financial support from the US 
government. "I don't want to deal with any government at 
all...I want to be independent," he said. 
  Wang admits his decision to leave China was made because he 
did not want to disappoint his wife and others who had worked 
for his release. More importantly, he was concerned that, if he 
turned down the offer of release, he might jeopardise the 
chances of other dissidents. 
  Wang believes there will be a better China in the near 
future 
if democratic movements either inside or outside China are 
better planned. He believes there are three things overseas 
democracy activists can do to improve China's human rights. 
"Firstly, they should do their best to preserve the present 
democratic force in China, which means they have to provide a 
safe back door to prepare for the worst scenario. 
  "Secondly, they have to provide financial support for the 
mainland's democratic movement. Last, but not least, they 
should continue to strengthen international support and keep 
feeding this support back to China." 
  Wang believes China's mainstream democratic movement still 
remains on the mainland, and urges overseas activists not to 
become too removed from China. "Any slight detachment from the 
mainstream movement in China would be equal to pulling the plug 
of the life-support machine that is keeping the dissidents going 
on the mainland." 
  He strongly disagrees with many who believe that China 
should 
be fed the Western recipe of democracy. "That Western style 
would never work in China. We need to formulate something that 
suits the Chinese taste." Wang says a better tomorrow for the 
Chinese, either in or out of China, should begin with a fight 
for dignity. "I want to let the world know we Chinese are not 
cowards. There are many of us on the mainland who are not 
afraid to fight the communist regime or voice a different view." 
  Throughout the best part of the interview, Hou kept silent 
nodding at times to show support and agreement on certain 
issues. Wang's little girl surprised many Chinese officials on 
the mainland during her courageous five years of campaigning for 
his fair treatment and ultimate release. 
  Wang admits that when it comes, to drawing the right 
attention and support, his little girl is streets ahead. He 
first met Hou at his own house party in Wuhan. A colleague 
introduced the two and recommended she join their magazine. 
Wang was not convinced of her ability then, despite praise from 
various quarters. But it was love at first sight, and Wang said 
Hou totally swept him off his feet. The two were married two 
months later in December that year. 
  Wang says he believes in eternal love, at least in his case. 
"The day we were married Xiaotian told me: 'Juntao, if you go to 
heaven I will follow you. If you go to hell, I will follow you, 
and if you get knocked down, I will be the first one to lift you 
up.' 
  "I thought she was bull-shitting me at the time, because 
many 
people do that in Beijing. I was so wrong," he said, reaching 
out to touch her hands. Hou said their strong love kept her 
going during his imprisonment. "There was no communication 
between us at all during those years. We both relied on that 
special feeling linking our souls, which kept us going," she 
said softly. 
  Wang did not realise his wife was the person behind his 
freedom. Only on the day of his release was he told by those who 
had imprisoned him. "I thought it was really strange they all 
told me not to forget the greatness of my wife." 
  Even on the way to the US, when he thanked the accompanying 
US official, the man told him: "You should thank your wife. 
Her sincerity touched every major democracy activist worldwide, 
many heads of state and our president."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "British Parliament's Report Is Out of Step </F>
With the Times"] 
  [Text] From last July to last February, a series of eight 
hearings was held by the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs 
Select Committee. During these hearings, many men of insight -- 
including Cradock -- called for a "stance that Britain must 
abide by the Joint Declaration," and they criticized changes in 
Britain's China policy as "injuring others without benefiting 
oneself." The Foreign Affairs Select Committee, however, turned 
a deaf ear to these criticisms, and on 13 April published a 
report entitled: "Anglo- Chinese Relations Before and After 
1997." Following its publication, the report was widely 
criticized by the media, which said that it "is "out of step 
with the times," "lacks a sense of historical reality," and "is 
irresponsible and erroneous." The Foreign Affairs Committee of 
the China's National People's Congress also sternly rebuked the 
report for flagrantly advocating viewpoints and suggestions 
hostile to China, and expressed its strong indignation at the 
report's wanton interference in China's internal affairs. 
  The British parliamentary report lacked a sense of 
historical 
reality. It could not but admit that the Chinese economy, with 
a vast market, is developing at full speed and thus Britain must 
maintain ties with China, but with the exception of this, all of 
its viewpoints and suggestions were hostile to China's 
flourishing development. Moreover, the report barefacedly 
stated that it was necessary not only to reverse the Joint 
Declaration, but also to repudiate the principles for 
establishing diplomatic relations between China and Britain. It 
called for turning back Britain's China policy to the 19th 
century to try to revive the old historical dream in which the 
great British Empire wantonly interfered in and split up China. 
  The report confessed that "Britain undeniably has changed 
its 
ways." It said: "It should not be taken for granted that the 
Beijing regime will last beyond 1997, so Britain should not draw 
up a rigid China policy." That is to say, even though Britain 
promised in the Joint Declaration to return Hong Kong to China 
and to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability during the 
transition period, the report proposed that the above-mentioned 
China policy "should not be formulated rigidly," which clearly 
laid bare Britain's malicious intention to rack its brains and 
to seize any opportunity to obstruct the implementation of the 
Joint Declaration. 
  The article "Our Basic Stand on the Issue of Hong Kong" and 
its annotations, which were published in the "Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping," showed very clearly that the British side would 
not return Hong Kong to China willingly. The fact that at that 
time, Mrs Thatcher put forward the "thesis of the validity of 
the three unequal treaties" and the "thesis of exchanging 
sovereignty for administrative authority" indicated Britain's 
holy grail of extending its administration over Hong Kong, but 
China warned the British side that if it did not change its 
position, China could not but unilaterally announce its own 
principles and policies for settling the Hong Kong issue. Only 
under this situation did Britain acknowledge that Hong Kong's 
sovereignty and administration should completely revert to 
China, and did Britain sign the Joint Declaration. However, 
Deng Xiaoping foresaw long ago that during the transition 
period, it would be mainly the British that created artificial 
chaos. It showed that the Chinese side was on the alert long 
ago against the likelihood that the British side -- under 
various pretexts and by all kinds of tricks -- definitely would 
attempt to obstruct China's resumption of the exercise of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong. The report imputed the reason for 
the change in Britain's China policy to the "Beijing 
disturbance" in 1989, which was absolutely a sophistry. As a 
matter of fact, this is the natural instinct of the British 
colonialists. International agreements, once signed, should be 
implemented, and no signatory should ever flagrantly interfere 
in the other party's internal affairs and take the latter's 
internal affairs as a pretext for not fulfilling agreements. 
The raging tide of cracking down on separatist activities in 
Northern Ireland and of mass resistance to the poll tax, as well 
as human rights problems, also were seen in Britain, but China 
had never made it a pretext for shirking its responsibility to 
fulfil the Joint Declaration. 
  In her memoirs entitled "The Downing Street Years," Mrs. 
Thatcher wrote that faced with China's solemn position, the 
British side could not but "indicate that we did not anticipate 
there would still be any power linkage between Britain and Hong 
Kong, or that Britain would have any obligation in Hong Kong 
after 1997. However, I felt sorry about that." For those who 
"felt sorry about" the fact that the British side could not but 
sign the Joint Declaration, the "Beijing disturbance" was a 
misfortune over which they gloated, and they harbored the 
illusion of a fluke rather than felt "sorry" about the 
situation, and even did not hesitate to make a reckless move, 
which was precisely a manifestation of colonialists unwilling to 
retreat from the historical scene. The report attacked Articles 
18 and 58 of the Basic Law, barefacedly opposed the fact that 
China has sovereignty over Hong Kong, urged the European Union 
to draw up anti-China policies, extended support to Patten's 
unilateral action in his "three violations" political reform 
package, and even flagrantly called for meddling in the Tibet 
and Taiwan issues. All these attacks are a resurgence of the 
die-hard nature of colonialism throughout history. 
  The report made various viewpoints and suggestions that 
were hostile to China, demonstrating that some people in Britain 
still try to employ tricks and to handle Sino-British relations 
with the gestures of a past century. The extent of the 
deficiency in their sense of historical reality and their 
inability to keep up with the times is amazing. The report 
said: "From the Opium War on, China has been forced to adapt to 
a new order of the international community backed by the 
international law, and this process is yet to be completed." 
This remark really hit the nail on the head and fully exposed 
Britain's motive in changing its China policy, that is, it wants 
to revert to the historical stage, from the Opium War to the 
years before 1949, when Britain plundered and split up China. 
The new China, however, rejected the so-called "order" imposed 
by Britain and other powers from the West. Hence, those 
die-hard colonialists in Britain yearn for the likelihood that 
the Chinese people's regime "may not last beyond 1997" and that 
the "process" of extending British rule over Hong Kong will be 
"completed!" 
  However, as China grows rich, strong, and prosperous, it is 
fully capable of resuming its exercise of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong on schedule. Moreover, Britain and other countries from 
the West will never be allowed to interfere in China's internal 
affairs or to split up its territory. While it has become a 
historical trend for every country in the world to develop its 
cherished relations with China, the British parliamentary report 
attempted to organize an international anti-China coalition to 
contain China, split it up, and obstruct it from resuming 
sovereignty over Hong Kong. However, all these moves indicated 
that they merely overrated their abilities. History will prove 
that the British parliamentary report merely noted down the 
dishonorable trouble-making scheme worked out by British 
colonialists when they were withdrawing from Hong Kong, whereas 
such a scheme is doomed to fail.

  [Text] Oleh Bilous, Ukrainian ambassador to the United 
States, has met with Nicholas (Bergs), U.S. National Security 
Council director. During their conversation, the officials 
concentrated on the implementation of economic agreements 
reached during the official visit of Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk in the United States in March of this year. In 
particular, they talked about the next visit of the U.S. [word 
indistinct] economic delegation to Kiev. Nicholas (Bergs) 
briefed the Ukrainian ambassador on plans and the agenda of the 
American delegation in Kiev. During the negotiations in Kiev, 
it is expected that problems will be discussed at the highest 
level related to the progress of economic reforms in Ukraine and 
U.S. aid intended to solve those problems. The Ukrainian and 
American officials will consider and try to agree upon specific 
terms and forms for extending financial and economic aid to 
Ukraine to implement concrete economic projects as part of the 
development of the market economy. Major emphasis at the next 
negotiations in Kiev will be put on issues related to 
intensifying trade between both countries and acceleration of 
U.S. investments into Ukrainian economy.

  [Text] A meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian 
Government and a delegation from the G-7 countries was held 
today in the Cabinet of Ministers. The Ukrainian Government 
group was headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov and 
the delegation from the G-7 countries by Antonio Puri Purini, 
authorized minister and head of the seventh department's working 
group on nuclear safety. This meeting was of a consultative 
nature, dealing mostly with issues of nuclear safety in Ukraine. 
They discussed cooperation by donor countries of the fund for 
nuclear safety, the EBRD, and other influential international 
organizations with Ukraine in technical, economic, and financial 
aspects. The sides, therefore, expressed readiness for joint 
action in the area of the safe exploitation of atomic energy and 
improving the state of the environment. 
  However, the word Chernobyl was often heard because one of 
the main conditions for all-round help from the G-7 countries to 
Ukraine is not only in resolving the problems of nuclear safety 
but also in strengthening the economy and the gradual closure of 
the Chernobyl AES [nuclear electric power station] generating 
sets.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy] 
  [Text] Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma stands the best 
chance in the presidential race. 
  According to the Socis-Gallup service, 18 percent of the 
electorate were prepared to vote for him in March, a significant 
increase on the 16.6 percent in December 1993. 
  A poll in all parts of Ukraine in which 1200 people older 
than 15 were questioned showed that Vyacheslav Chornovil (9.1 
percent in March and 10 percent in March) and President Leonid 
Kravchuk (16.5 and 11 percent, respectively) were also fairly 
popular figures. 
  At its latest congress the Popular Rukh decided not to field 
its own presidential candidate. 
  Kravchuk agreed to register as a possible candidate. Nikolay 
Mikhalchenko, his domestic policy aide, told Interfax that 
Kravchuk had thus shown that he was not afraid of elections. 
  On the other hand, Mikhalchenko said that Kravchuk would ask 
the new parliament to postpone the elections which are scheduled 
for June 26. 
  As reported earlier, 120 members of the new parliament are 
prepared to back this proposal. 
  Kuchma thought that a postponement would be useful for 
implementing a specific economic reform program but he rejected 
Kravchuk's argument that the postponement was needed to change 
the power structure and to have the duties of the new president 
specified in the Constitution. 
  Numerous parties and trade unions agree with Kravchuk that a 
new constitution had to be adopted before the elections. This 
view is shared, in particular, by the "greens" who called on 
Kravchuk to put off the presidential and local elections until 
the end of the year. They say that the presidential race must be 
resumed following the adoption of a Constitution by a 
Constitutional Assembly. 
  Levko Lukyanenko, leader of the Ukraine democratic league, 
told Interfax that the presidential elections had to be 
postponed until the end of 1994 or early 1995. He thought that 
presidential elections had not to be held before a Constitution 
was adopted which would define whether Ukraine would be a 
presidential or a parliamentary republic or a cross between them 
or before the power of the president were defined or legislation 
on local administration was in place. 
  Donetsk coalfield trade unions are prepared to negotiate a 
postponement of the elections with Kravchuk, Igor Dyatlov, who 
chairs the inter-regional league of strike committees, told 
Interfax. 
  Meanwhile, Mikhail Volynets, chairman of the Inter-Regional 
Union of the Independent Miners' Union, told Interfax-Ukraine 
that the miners were kept in the dark about the presidential 
race and showed no interest in it. In his view, of all the 
presidential nominees Kravchuk alone could run the country. He 
thought that Kuchma was responsible for the falling living 
standards of the miners.

  [Text] An official visit by a Russian parliamentary

promoting equal and mutually beneficial relations in political, 
social, economic, cultural, and other spheres, this alone would 
be sufficient for the successful development of ties between 
parliaments and peoples of the two sovereign countries. 
  The Russian Federation Council chairman first visited Prime 
Minister Dzhumagulov. For over an hour they discussed economic 
problems of the two republics. They also discussed the issue of 
putting to a better use Kyrgyzstan's former defense facilities. 
Their capacities are not being used at present. However, each 
sovereign state should be able to defend itself. Therefore the 
defense industry should not be moved backstage, and the 
centuries-old, friendly relations between the two countries 
should not be neglected. As the saying goes: An old friend is 
better than two new ones. We cannot ask Russia alone to settle 
the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh. We don't want it to be blamed 
for imperialist manners, if it alone will be forced to impose 
order here. Of course, we recognize the special interests of 
Russia in relation to this and other regions of the former USSR. 
But at present, Russia not only counts on its own forces but 
expects that all the other CIS countries will correctly 
understand its policy. All this was stated by Sherimkulov, 
speaker of the Kyrgyzstan parliament, during a brief news 
conference after signing the agreement on interparliamentary 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Russian Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko said: 
Russia's main interest is (?peace) in Central Asia and the 
Caucasus. The Russian armed forces in the Caucasus are a kind of 
dividing line between warring sides. We recently reached an 
accord on economic cooperation of the CIS countries, but it is 
impossible to do anything for the well-being of people if two 
CIS member-countries are fighting against each other. This 
impedes developments in the CIS. 
  Answering the question from a journalist from 
Nagorno-Karabakh on details of the peace-making plan, Shumeyko 
said: Parliamentarians agree on this issue -- that a 
comprehensive approach to this problem should be taken. We can 
speak about three stages: First, full cessation of military 
activities [words indistinct] and signing a peace treaty. Only 
after this can we specify the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. No 
less important is the fact that a third side has been invited to 
participate in talks on settling the conflict -- the three 
chairmen of Supreme Soviets of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, 
the Russian Federation, and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh 
will try to find a solution to the problem that has not been 
solved by governments. Under these conditions the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly cannot withdraw until it finds a 
solution to the problem, Shumeyko said. 
  The guests left for Osh and Dzhalalabad oblasts, the areas 
where natural calamity has happened. Talks on settling the 
Caucasian conflict will begin on 4 May.

  [Text] As BELAPAN learned, Mikhail Marynich, Belarusian 
deputy minister for external economic relations, received today 
Jean-Joseph (Boillo), the economic adviser for Central and 
Eastern Europe at the French Embassy in Prague. During their 
conversation, both officials discussed issues related to the 
condition of Belarusian-French trade and prospects for its 
development. As its positive factor, Mr. (Boillo) pointed to 
the Belarusian-Russian monetary merger agreement and, among 
others, the results of the customs union between Russia and 
Belarus. According to both sides, trade between Belarus and 
France will only gain by the introduction of common customs 
tariffs on the Belarusian-Russian border. Mikhail Marynich 
emphasized that as a result of the customs union with Russia, a 
range of Western countries will view Belarus as a springboard 
for entering the Russian market, which, in the opinion of M. 
Marynich, will serve the Belarusian economy well.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; Edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] During the Easter holidays Estonian President 
Lennart Meri received in the Tallinn Kadriorg Castle a group of 
Russian journalists visiting Estonia at the invitation of the 
Estonian Foreign Ministry. During the conversation Meri 
answered questions by special correspondents of Interfax 
Aleksandr Budris and Boris Grishenko. 
  Interfax: Mr. President, how do you see a way towards the 
improvement of relations between Estonia and Russia? 
  Meri: I cannot say that I am satisfied with the present 
status of relations between the countries. 18 rounds of 
Estonian-Russian talks prove the opposite: it is necessary to 
move faster toward normalization of relations between the 
neighboring countries. 
  I think that all existing problems in relations between 
Estonia and Russia can be resolved in a civilized way. 
Although, frankly speaking, two years ago I was more optimistic 
on this issue. It seemed to me that all problems can be 
considered calmly and friendly. Including those which remained 
as a criminal heritage of the treaties between Stalin and 
Hitler. Taking this opportunity, I would like to note that 
although Estonia and Russia had conflicts sometimes, but 
historically they maintained normal relations. Extremism was not 
characteristic for any of the sides. 
  We, Estonians, are realists by nature and we know that 
Russia 
will always be our closest neighbor. And we would like to take 
a positive experience from our common past, not a negative one. 
We have enough of it. 
  Interfax: How can Russian-Estonian talks be intensified by 
putting them on the path of concrete decisions? 
  Meri: First of all, I would like to stress the use of these 
talks, because there are people in both countries who doubt 
their expediency. The Estonian-Russian dialogue is now rather 
active. It cannot be interrupted. 
  If delegations of both countries have been meeting regularly 
for two years, these are not instant contacts, but serious 
bilateral cooperation. 
  But there is a dangerous tendency in this dialogue: talking 
to each other for long, specialists can go deep into details and 
lose important strategic targets. 
  It seems to me that a meeting between the Estonian and 
Russian presidents could help break this vicious circle. I am 
sure that our meeting with Boris Yeltsin would enable us to 
conceptually resolve the most important problems in relations 
between the two countries, from economic to cultural ones. 
  We do not break off contacts with the Russian president. We 
conduct correspondence with Boris Yeltsin by official channels. 
But unfortunately I cannot indicate a possible date of such a 
meeting. Let me add that I am its supporter. 
  IF Note: On April 30 during an official visit of Latvian 
president Guntis Ulmanis to Moscow, IF's correspondent asked 
Yeltsin the following question: "When will the Russian-Estonian 
treaty on the withdrawal of troops be signed?" "We would very 
much like to sign such a document," the Russian president said. 
"We do not have special goals in Estonia, especially military 
ones. We also intend to pull our all troops from Estonia. 
However, Russia would like to do it in the same way as it was 
done with Lithuania and Latvia -- on the legal basis, so that a 
treaty with a clear timetable of control over its implementation 
is signed. We work so with Germany, from where all Russian 
troops will be pulled out this year. Therefore, in case of 
Estonia, they need to show goodwill, and from our side there is 
already full agreement." 
  Interfax: Lately the Estonian political circles have been 
talking about the need to attract Finland as a mediator in the 
Russian-Estonian talks. What is your opinion on this issue? 
  Meri: I welcome any step which would lead to improvement of 
Estonian-Russian relations. I think that mediation by the 
experienced politician -- the Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari 
would ease the tense atmosphere created at the Estonian-Russian 
talks. Let me repeat that after two years of meetings the 
delegations did not make any progress. 
  I would like to note that the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from Estonia and Latvia meets the interests of Russia itself. 
With full certainty I can say that the withdrawal will be 
followed by activization of economic relations between our 
countries. And this means that in this case we are talking 
about mutual benefit, not about the victory of one side and 
failure of another. 
  Estonia is a small country, but it is also capable of being 
useful for such continent as Russia. Take our geopolitical 
position, our convenient harbors. Is it possible to say that 
Rotterdam port, for example, belongs to some separate country? 
It belongs to the whole Europe. 
  Interfax: What do you think about the border dispute between 
Estonia and Russia? 
  Meri: Any border dispute, including ours, is similar to 
"Pandora box": nobody knows how it can be closed or who can do 
that. However, we have to find a clear answer to this question 
too. 
  I think there is a possibility to simply delay resolution of 
this problem for 5-10 years, by finding some proper solution of 
border disputes. Of course, we are not talking about a new iron 
curtain, bu I am sure that such border should equally defend 
both Estonia and Russia from criminals, smugglers, drug dealers. 
This border should gain a European character. 
  Interfax: How do you see the role of NATO in contemporary 
world? 
  Meri: I think this organization has not obtained more 
enemies and it transformed from the military union into a kind 
of fire team. The power of NATO is aimed not against someone, 
but at safeguarding stability in the world. Like firemen, NATO 
is organized and disciplines, that is why we trust NATO. 
  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania altogether can set up a 
peacekeeping battalion. The tragedy of Yugoslavia proves once 
again that a calm Europe is being born painfully. 
  Interfax: How do you see the resolution of the problem of 
non-native residents of Estonia, those who are not citizens of 
the republic? 
  Meri: I think politicians should answer this question. The 
attitude to citizenship is the right and the duty of every human 
being, it is a very intimate feeling. Let everybody decide 
which country he likes more in his heart. There have been 
mistakes on both sides concerning this issue. Some Russian 
politicians are trying to speak on behalf of Russians, 
Ukrainians, Georgians living in Estonia and to speak in their 
defense. Let me remind that such position caused contradictory 
attitude of these very people, many of who are descendants of 
Estonian citizens. 
  When people say that non-Estonians should defend their 
rights 
in Estonia, I ask: which rights in particular? This question 
is hard to answer for our opponents and for us. It is good that 
our northern phlegmatic character allowed us to put this dispute 
into a calm and civilized path.

  [Text] On 3 May Islam Karimov, president of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan, received Ukeru Magasaki, ambassador extraordinary 
and plenipotentiary of Japan to our country. Noting the 
prestigious position that Japan occupies in the world community, 
Islam Karimov stated that firm mutual economic, trade, and 
cultural ties have been established and contacts in all other 
fields are developing successfully. Japan is a distant and very 
much a legendary country for us; it has already stepped into the 
21st century and is a leading power, the leader of Uzbekistan 
told the ambassador. Japan is supplying companies worldwide 
with modern technology and if mutual relations with Uzbekistan, 
where there are stable conditions, a good climate, and rich 
natural resources, become closer, then the development of such 
economic cooperation will become even more beneficial for both 
countries. Ukeru Magasaki thanked the president for the warm 
reception and stressed that the newly formed Government of Japan 
will strive further for the productive development of mutually 
beneficial ties with Uzbekistan. Saidmukhtar Saidkasymov, 
minister for foreign affairs of Uzbekistan, was present at the 
meeting.

<F P=106> [Interview with Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan by </F>
Tsvetana Krusteva in Sofia; date not given: "Disintegration of 
Soviet Union Is Still Continuing"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Krusteva] It is claimed 
that Moscow is the key to solving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 
  [Papazyan] I am not sure how far one can claim this. Of 
course, Moscow wields very great influence in Azerbaijan, 
Nagorno-Karabakh, and Armenia, but I would not say the key lies 
in Moscow. Moscow has influence over all the parties to the 
conflict, as it has over all the processes in the former USSR, a 
fact that one has to bear in mind. However, the point in this 
case is that other countries are now being drawn into the 
conflict as well. Moscow is not the only one that can influence 
the peace process, but also Iran and certain other states. We 
should not forget that 2,000 Afghan mojahedin are fighting for 
the Azeris against the Karabakh army and the self-defense forces. 
  We think the best way to seek peace is to organize talks 
through international organizations. It seems that now it is 
possible to negotiate a cease-fire. If we manage to stop the 
war, then we can start talks in other directions as well, such 
as on withdrawing troops from the occupied territories and on 
suspending the blockade of Armenia. 
  [Krusteva] Can Armenia exist without Russia, and vice-versa? 
  [Papazyan] We are existing without them right now. 
  [Krusteva] What is your view on ideas mooted in Moscow of 
creating a new state to replace the former USSR? 
  [Papazyan] They are unrealistic. Such proposals have no 
real foundation. Naturally, Armenia has strong historical links 
with Russia, and I do not think this is such a bad thing. In 
principle we believe that we should maintain good relations with 
Moscow, and as far as I know they think the same. Wherever 
possible, we will deepen these relations. We are allied with 
Russia, but want to cooperate with other countries as well. We 
have quite good relations with Iran, which is our third biggest 
trading partner, and I think we can extend our relations with 
them in the future. We also have good relations with some EU 
countries, such as France, and also with the United States. 
  [Krusteva] Why was Armenia one of the CIS countries that did 
not object to President Yeltsin's proposed decree on creating 
Russian military bases on the territory of the former USSR? 
Other CIS countries reacted sharply. 
  [Papazyan] There is no need even for negotiations on this, 
because for a long time we have had a treaty with Russia on 
maintaining three Russian bases in Armenia, and they exist. 
Armenia was one of the founders of the CIS, and actively 
participates in the community because we believe one must delay 
the disintegration of the USSR. In my view, this disintegration 
is still continuing. All the conflicts on the territory of the 
former Soviet Union prove this. We must ensure that the "pain" 
during the period of disintegration is as mild as possible. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Krusteva] Ankara recently accused Yerevan of allowing the 
Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) to maintain bases on its territory. 
  [Papazyan] The Turkish leadership is unable to grasp that 
Turkey has to solve its own problems, and there is no point in 
seeking solutions where they do not exist. Armenia does not 
help the PKK. Even if it wanted to, Armenia is not in a 
position to help them. Armenia needs help itself and is in 
receipt of humanitarian aid. In principle we are against 
interference in the internal affairs of any country. 
Incidentally, Armenia is not the only country against which 
Demirel and the other Turkish leaders make such accusations. 
They claim that Iran, Syria, and Greece are helping the PKK. 
We attribute this to the fact that Ankara cannot find a way to 
solve this problem. 
  [Krusteva] In an interview with a Russian newspaper, 
President Demirel said that Armenia should maintain good 
relations with Turkey if it wants to develop well in its region. 
What do you think? 
  [Papazyan] I agree with Demirel, but would add that if 
Turkey wants to have good relations with Azerbaijan of the 
Central Asian republics, it should also have good relations with 
Armenia. [passage omitted] 
  [Krusteva] Mr. Papazyan, what does Armenia want in the 
Balkans? 
  [Papazyan] Politically speaking, we have always have good 
traditional relations with the Balkan countries. Our people 
have many common historical and cultural links. We should not 
have good relations only with Russia and Iran, for example, but 
also with any other country that wants this. Accordingly, we 
are ready for cooperation. In the Balkans and in Bulgaria, I 
hope that we will discover that we understand one another. I 
came here after visiting Romania, toward which we have the same 
attitude. We are ready to cooperate with any country, even 
Turkey, but unfortunately at the moment Ankara is still not 
ready for this. 
  [Krusteva] You signed a trade agreement here, but last year 
our imports from Armenia fell in comparison with 1992. How will 
out bilateral trade develop in the future? 
  [Papazyan] I would point out that I am responsible for 
foreign affairs. My most important task is to find solutions to 
the problems that face me in my own field, such as a peaceful 
solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. If this is achieved, 
I am absolutely certain that Armenia will very quickly 
experience an economic upsurge. Our country was one of the most 
developed former Soviet republics, but because of the warfare in 
Nagorno-Karabakh and the economic blockade we are in a very 
difficult situation. As regards our bilateral relations with 
Bulgaria, at the moment we are laying a juridical basis for 
them. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 84 (574) for 3 </F>
May 1994 compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, 
edited by Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] "The experience of the past few years has 
demonstrated that it is impossible at this stage to form a truly 
national Georgian army that would become a guarantor of 
independence without friendship and cooperation with Russia." 
The statement was made in a Monday interview with local radio 
by the Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  He said that the appointment of Lieutenant-General Vardiko 
Nadibaidze to the post of Defence Minister last week began a new 
stage in the life of the army. Nadibaidze used to be deputy 
commander of the Russian army group in Transcaucasia. In the 
interview the Georgian leader said new professional approaches 
are necessary and that was the reason for proposing Nadibaidze 
to the post of minister. According to Shevardnadze, the general 
is an experienced specialist and good organizer who is perfectly 
familiar with the principles of forming an army as well as with 
weaponry. 
  Independent experts in Tbilisi see a link between 
Shevardnadze's statements about the need to build an efficient 
army and his recent declarations that though giving preference 
to peaceful political methods of settling the Abkhazian problem 
the leadership of the country does not rule out a military 
solution. 
  During his recent visit to west Georgia Shevardnadze 
expressed hope that the painful problem would be settled finally 
within two or three months. He accounted the possibility to the 
improvement of relations with Russia and to help from the 
international community. IF Note: Meanwhile, a personal envoy 
of the Georgian head of state Aleksandr Kavsadze has 
categorically denied the charges of the Abkhazian authorities 
that the Georgian government connives with provocative actions 
of Georgian saboteurs in Gali region. He declared that Georgia 
remains a supporter of a peaceful and honorable settlement of 
the conflict in Abkhazia.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev left for 
Brussels this afternoon to take part in the discussion of NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program. The head of the Azerbaijani 
state will sign a document in the capital of Belgium on the our 
republic's adherence to this program. Membership in such a 
program will play an important role in Azerbaijan's 
rapprochement with the Western countries, and will create wider 
possibilities to make use of NATO's prestige and influence for 
the peaceful resolution of the conflict [with Armenia] through 
talks. 
  Before leaving for Brussels, the Azerbaijani president spoke 
to reporters on the aim of his visit. 
  [Begin Aliyev recording] I will sign the document. This is 
the main purpose of my visit. In addition to that, many 
business circles in Brussels want to meet with me. I will meet 
with businessmen to solve the economic problems. This is 
because, as you know, Belgium is the center of European Economic 
Community. I will also discuss how this economic union could 
assist Azerbaijan. This is the main aim of my visit. 
  Undoubtedly, the current situation in Azerbaijan, the 
ongoing 
war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the continuing 
aggression by Armenia against Azerbaijan -- these attacks are 
continuing even today -- will be explained both at NATO 
headquarters and during my other contacts. I will hold talks on 
these issues and will set out Azerbaijan's policies. 
  The Armenian Armed Forces have been unceasingly attacking 
Azerbaijani territory since 10 April, despite the fact that they 
are suffering heavy losses. The Azerbaijani Armed Forces are 
causing them major losses. Despite that, they are still 
pressing ahead with their attacks, and they are not launching 
these attacks alone. I think that there are many forces helping 
them. 
  We want to stop the shooting. We have already issued 
statements to this effect. We agreed to sign the cease-fire 
agreement sponsored and proposed by Russia's Foreign and Defense 
Ministries on 28 April. However, the Armenian side has not 
agreed to this. In the meantime, a large CSCE group has visited 
Azerbaijan headed by Mr. Mosberg. This delegation also included 
U.S. generals and representatives of Russia, Italy, and other 
CSCE countries. Mr. Mosberg held extensive talks with me. He 
then visited Daghlyk-Karabakh's [Nagorno-Karabakh] Khankendi 
[Stepanakert], and Yerevan. He returned to Baku for talks with 
me. They too put forward a draft cease-fire agreement. I 
agreed to that draft agreement too. However, when they returned 
to Yerevan and talked with Armenian President Ter-Petrosyan, he 
and the Armenian leadership did not agree to sign this agreement 
for the time being, and declared that at present they are not 
ready for a cessation of hostilities on the pretext that a 
special mechanism should be prepared to oversee a cease-fire. 
  We too know that a special mechanism is needed to ensure and 
supervise the cease-fire. However, this mechanism could be 
created after the establishment of a cease-fire. It will serve 
neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan if we now sit and work on a 
mechanism while the fighting continues and people get killed on 
both sides. Mr. Mosberg phoned us from Yerevan informing us 
that the Armenian side did not agree with this, and therefore 
his delegation returned to Vienna. 
  This is the situation for now. The Armenians are continuing 
their attacks, and the Azerbaijani Armed Forces are retaliating. 
The Armenian attacks have been repulsed in some sectors and 
their military goals have been blocked. They have withdrawn and 
suffered many losses. Despite this, the war is continuing. 
  We are not for war. I again declare today that we favor the 
establishment of a cease-fire. However, the Armenian side does 
not agree to this. We will pursue our peace-loving policy. 
[end recording] 
  The Azerbaijani president was seen off at Bina airport by 
Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet; Prime 
Minister Suret Guseynov; Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet; deputy prime ministers, ministers, heads of 
the state enterprises and law enforcement organs.

    [Editorial Report] Riga Radio Riga Network in Latvian at 
0900 GMT on 3 May carries a live interview with Prime Minister 
Valdis Birkavs by an unnamed correspondent from the Riga Radio 
studio. 
  [Correspondent] "I will ask you several questions. First of 
all, on the agreements that were recently signed in Moscow, on 
the agreements between Latvia and Russia that are linked to the 
withdrawal of the Russian Army, perhaps such a general issue 
and then more specific ones will follow. 
  "At a news conference immediately after returning from 
Moscow, you and [President] Mr. Ulmanis stressed that Latvian 
representatives had signed agreements with a new democratic 
Russia. However, that Russia is only one small part of Russia, 
which currently can influence the policy of neighboring 
countries only to a certain extent. Everything may change and 
turn upside down there. Not all the Latvian people support the 
agreements signed by the government and the state president. 
With this there is a feeling that the weight of these 
agreements is not very great and there is certain instability in 
the two states and perhaps one should not fully take them into 
account as particularly important documents. How do you respond 
this?" 
  [Birkavs] "The idea that the situation is not stable in 
Russia is included in the question quite correctly. That is 
exactly why the agreements give me the guarantee of stable 
relations with Russia, irrespective of what events follow in 
Russia. That gives the guarantee that under control of the 
world public, the Army will be withdrawn, the Skrunda radar 
station will be dismantled, and it will be possible with the 
help of foreign money and under international control to 
repatriate the military pensioners. This is where the meaning 
and significance of the agreements lies. 
  "I think there is not and has not been an unequivocal 
attitude toward the agreements in Latvia. I understand very 
well and support this activity of the people. Sociological 
studies show that approximately 15 percent of all the people in 
Latvia are completely and categorically against the agreements. 
These people also have their own considerations; it is 
necessary to talk to them, to explain to them. However, history 
will evidently give the fairest assessment of the significance 
of these agreements." 
  [Correspondent] "Yes, that is an international aspect and 
that is also your responsibility, which you already stressed at 
the news conference on 1 May. That is your responsibility. 
  "So then, can you explain -- I do not know in how much 
detail 
you can do it now -- but what will be the control mechanism over 
the Army withdrawal? How will the repatriation of the military 
take place? What controls will there be so that we, reporters 
and representatives of the press, will also be able to follow 
closely these processes? Who will be responsible for that? I 
understand that the control mechanism and the range of people 
involved in it should be rather wide." 
  [Birkavs] "The most significant control mechanisms are 
provided by the agreements themselves. You stressed very 
correctly that, in order for reporters to be able to follow the 
progress of the withdrawal, and to tell the truth, it is 
necessary to give all the people the opportunity to follow the 
progress of the withdrawal. First of all, we will publish the 
withdrawal timetable. We are currently working so that 
ministries and local governments are instructed to follow the 
progress of withdrawal at a local level. We will also provide 
the assistance necessary for the army to be withdrawn from here 
possibly quicker. 
  "As far as repatriation is concerned, money collection is 
currently under way for this purpose. At a government session 
today, we will approve the board of the repatriation fund and a 
corresponding mechanism. Mechanisms have to be created here. 
You very correctly understood that the idea of repatriation has 
not perhaps been completely worked out legally. However, this 
is the first time that Russia at last has agreed to call its 
sons and daughters back home. Before, they had only been 
speaking of people of Russian nationality being in the near 
abroad and other countries and that they would protect their 
human rights. The situation has changed and the Russian side 
will also actively promote repatriation." 
  After this the correspondent suggests that the Russian 
military personnel will be withdrawn, but their families will be 
left behind and then the former military will come back to 
reunite with their families. She asks whether it will be really 
possible to control this process and whose responsibility it 
will be. Birkavs says: 
  [Birkavs] "The repatriation will be together with families 
and when we begin to divide the money -- there is already real 
money in the repatriation fund -- then we will give priority, 
and I have stressed it everywhere and such is my agreement with 
Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, that discharged officers 
under the age of 50 and under the age of 60 [as heard] have to 
be repatriated first. Then they will need entry visas to be 
able to return to Latvia. That is a very simple, 
internationally recognized, and well regulated control 
mechanism. Therefore, one should not be afraid of it, but it is 
very necessary to exercise strict control." 
  The correspondent then asks Prime Minister Birkavs about the 
possibility of monitoring what goes on inside the Skrunda radar 
station, which has been impossible even for the Bureau for 
Monitoring the Withdrawal of the Russian Army. 
  [Birkavs] "Well, 599 military personnel, and 199 service 
personnel: That is the amount that can be located at Skrunda. 
That can be monitored simply and easily enough. Besides, 
considering that the guarding and monitoring is up to us, these 
we can monitor, and anyway, if any discussions or differences 
arise, a mechanism has also been created for taking up these 
discussions and differences." 
  Birkavs adds he is satisfied no new troops could be brought 
in. 
  [Correspondent] "About the treaty, I think the listeners 
too will be perhaps asking more detailed questions, but I am 
still interested in the government's current stability. Last 
week the Saeima, the Saeima deputies voted, you could say, for 
confidence in the government, although among the voters were the 
ministers themselves. Of course, they would not vote against 
confidence in themselves, so this vote can be viewed variously. 
And, as far as the nationalist forces have announced, they are 
forming, quite seriously forming recently, alternative 
government structures. How does that affect the current work of 
the government?" 
  [Birkavs] "Firstly I would like to say that the vote of 
confidence in the government was requested by me personally, 
because it is very difficult to work in circumstances where 
there is no confidence in the government. If all the deputies 
of the Latvian Way and the Peasants' Union had been at the 
plenary session, then in fact, the result of the vote would have 
been 60 or 61 votes. Let me remind you that when this 
government was accepted, we had only 54 supporters. So in fact, 
the number of supporters of the government in parliament has 
grown. The ministers voted for themselves, yes. If they had 
abstained, then only deputies who have claims to ministerial 
posts would have to abstain, as they become interested in taking 
on these posts, so ethically they would not vote for them." 
  Birkavs adds that he challenges this shadow cabinet to come 
out more openly, and he welcomes its formation.

<F P=106> [Report: "Lu Ping Says Good Atmosphere Needed for Meeting </F>
With Patten"] 
  [Text] Yesterday (3 May), Lu Ping, vice chairman and 
secretary general of the Preliminary Working Committee, who is 
visiting Hong Kong, said that he hoped to meet Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten in the future in a better atmosphere so 
that they would really be able to achieve certain results 
through a meeting; at present, the Hong Kong Government was not 
friendly to the Preliminary Working Committee, so if he and the 
governor held personal talks, the talks might not achieve any 
results. 
  Last night, after attending a cocktail party held by XINHUA 
Hong Kong Branch in honor of the visiting mainland members of 
the Preliminary Working Committee, Lu Ping answered questions 
raised by reporters. When asked when he would meet with the 
Hong Kong governor, he said that he hoped there would be a 
better atmosphere so that both sides might actually achieve 
certain results through a meeting; otherwise, it would be 
meaningless if they met and achieved no result. 
  Lu Ping said: At present, the Hong Kong Government is not 
friendly enough toward the Preliminary Working Committee. It 
does not allow Hong Kong civil servants to meet committee 
members. In such circumstances, even if personal talks are held 
with the governor, the talks may not achieve any result. So it 
is better to first make some progress on certain issues through 
lower-level contacts through various channels, and then he may 
consider whether it is possible to achieve certain results 
through talks between him and the governor. 
  When talking about the airport issue, Lu Ping said that the 
two sides were still discussing issues concerning the airport 
project and the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. He believed 
that an option acceptable to both sides would be worked out. He 
hoped that agreement would be reached on the financial package 
and airport management regulations before long. 
  Lu Ping said that he came to Hong Kong this time in his 
capacity as vice chairman and secretary general of the 
Preliminary Working Committee to attend meetings of the 
political and economic affairs groups. The two groups are 
holding meetings in Hong Kong mainly for the purpose of enabling 
their members to listen to more opinions from various quarters 
in Hong Kong. He stressed that the task of the Preliminary 
Working Committee was to strive for a smooth transition in 1997, 
and he believed that a smooth transition represented the common 
wish of all Hong Kong residents. So he expects support and 
cooperation from the general public for the work of the 
Preliminary Working Committee, and the committee is also willing 
to listen to opinions from all quarters of the local community. 
  Lu Ping said that because he had to rush back to Beijing to 
handle some urgent matters, his schedule in Hong Kong was very 
busy. Many friends wanted to see him, but he did not have enough 
time, and he was sorry about that. He hoped that he would stay 
in Hong Kong for a longer period next time. When asked about 
his feelings about Hong Kong, he said that he did not have any 
special feelings because he did not go sightseeing in the 
streets. 
  Lu Ping asked the mass media to convey his regards to the 
residents of Hong Kong. He said that he had not visited Hong 
Kong in the last one or two years, and he really wanted to see 
what changes had occurred in various aspects. However, he had 
to attend meetings these days, so he could only greet Hong Kong 
people through the media.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Vydrin, director of the International </F>
Global and Regional Security Institute (IGRSI), by Volodymyr 
Skachko; place and date not given: "It is Better To Do This 
`Before' Than `After'"] 
  [Text] At the end of last week, an international 
conference "Interregional Conflicts in the Post-Totalitarian 
World" was held near Kiev. Specialists from various Ukrainian 
scientific and state structures and from research institutions 
of NATO, Russia, Moldova, Great Britain, the United States, and 
Italy participated in it. 
  Ukraine was represented by one of the organizers of the 
conference -- the IGRSI. Its director Dmytro Vydrin comments 
upon the course and results of the conference. 
  [Vydrin] It was one of Ukraine's first conferences on 
"conflictology." We are pleased that we managed to hold it, as 
it seems to me, there is one major shortcoming in Ukraine, 
namely, its introvert political mentality: Almost all political 
problems that Ukraine deals with, directly concern Ukraine 
alone. From the viewpoint of common sense and pragmatism, this 
might seem normal. However, we profess a different idea: We 
believe that a state may only become a normal one if it shows 
interest in problems that go beyond its geographical borders. 
That is why it was, perhaps, the very first conference where 
Ukrainian specialists analyzed not only internal problems, but 
also those of the Dniester Region and of the "hot spots," such 
as those in Belfast, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and so on. As 
a matter of fact, our task consisted of reviewing all such spots 
in order to determine whether, today, mechanisms exist that are 
capable of helping in the resolution of such conflicts. God 
forbid the need to use this experience in Ukraine. We hope that 
Ukraine will avoid this danger, but if, to our greatest pity, we 
fail in this, we would not like to be "naked" both 
intellectually and psychologically when confronted by it. 
  [Skachko] Was there a specific result of the conference? 
  [Vydrin] As is normal for initial conferences, it took us 
half of the time to unify the terminology and to begin to 
understand one another. Then we tried specifically, for 
example, to determine the limit of resorting to military force 
in conflicts and the limit of using peacekeeping forces and 
actions, as well as their possibilities and limitations. For 
the time being, we have just addressed this theme. At the next 
conference, we will get closer to elaborating specific recipes 
and recommendations, which we will be able to offer to 
politicians. 
  [Skachko] Did the conference result in comprehending the 
fact that interregional conflicts are perfectly possible in 
Ukraine? 
  [Vydrin] Our scientific community became divided into 
"pessimists" and "optimists." I belong to such "optimists" and 
believe that, unfortunately, conflicts are virtually 
unavoidable, although our colleagues, in particular, the British 
ones, believe that it is quite easy to avoid conflicts in 
Ukraine. However, I am convinced that it is hardly possible to 
outsmart history, which teaches us that fragments of empires 
become arenas for conflicts. There have been almost no 
exceptions in history.... 
  [Skachko] Isn't the situation in the Crimea and in the 
Donetsk-Luhansk Region the reason for your optimism in inverted 
commas? 
  [Vydrin] Yes, we gave much of our time to discussing the 
situation in those regions and, unfortunately, discussed it in 
the context of situations analogous to those in the Dniester 
Region and in Karabakh. Unfortunately, for us, the Crimea is a 
potential Dniester Region or Karabakh. We gather in advance in 
order to prevent it from becoming an actual situation. 
  [Skachko] D. Vydrin also added to this that the IGRSI plans 
to hold such conferences twice a year, and this week, the 
conference on "Interethnic Conflicts in the Post-Totalitarian 
World" was in progress in Kiev. The subject matters are 
related, because not infrequently, interethnic strife becomes 
that same internal factor that generates interregional conflicts 
and even wars. It is, indeed, better to prevent conflicts than 
to resolve them.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has received 
Alain Lamassoure, French minister delegate for European affairs. 
The officials held a conversation that raised a number of 
important issues related to the further development of 
Ukrainian-French cooperation. For Ukraine, the president 
emphasized, relations with European states, (?including) France, 
are very important. This is why Ukraine appreciates so much 
France's attitude toward the trilateral declaration signed by 
our state [words indistinct]. We also appreciate efforts by 
France, and its president, Francois Mitterrand, to help Ukraine 
destroy nuclear weapons as well as develop its nuclear power 
engineering system and liquidate the consequences of the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident. 
  Following the meeting with the president, most of which was 
held without media representatives, the guest answered questions 
from journalists. In particular, he emphasized that in his 
opinion, there are no differences between the French and 
Ukrainian points of view on the danger of instability on our 
continent. We, Alain Lamassoure declared, are for a Europe 
serving as the center of peace, stability, and prosperity so 
that relations among states are based on equality, democratic 
principles, and friendship, and so that there are no blocs 
forming on European territory. France itself, the guest 
continued, came up with an initiative to hold a conference on 
problems of stability and security in Europe, at which 
representatives of those countries could discuss these problems. 
[Words indistinct] confirmation of Leonid Kravchuk that your 
country will participate in this conference and work there 
constructively. The meeting was attended by Michel Peissik, 
French ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Rustam Arifdzhanov report: "Moscow Trader Leaves the </F>
Street"] 
  [Text] By means of the Moscow government's decree "On 
Additional Measures To Regulate Free (Street) Trading and 
Organize Flea Markets in Moscow" the capital's authorities are 
ending their love affair with garish market conditions and 
making the switch to regulation and administrative control, 
which are so customary and comprehensible to city officialdom. 
  Street traders, who have become a kind of symbol of the new 
times and new mores, are being driven from their trading pitches 
selected over the past few years. The strict decree prescribes 
the complete cessation of any unorganized trading from hand to 
hand and from stands, carts, or vehicles. Mindful of the fact 
that a similar merciless decree was also adopted by the city 
leadership of St. Petersburg last month, it is possible to speak 
of the end of the mass venture into the trading business by the 
working masses and pensioners. Grandmothers with packets of 
cigarette, loaves of bread, and mayonnaise are ending their 
labor exploit and returning to their grandchildren, to benches 
outside their entrances, and to [live on] their wretched 
pensions. 
  It is possible to understand the authorities. They are 
pretty fed up with being accused of turning the squares and 
streets entrusted to them into speculators' "bazaars" which do 
little to embellish the city. At the same time unorganized 
trade has produced no income for the city budgets. On the other 
hand, there has been an easing of pressure from the street 
market "kings," who have had time to accumulate proper capital, 
to gain respectability, and to lose interest in the business in 
which they themselves started. 
  What is proposed in exchange? Small-scale trade is being 
driven into commercial kiosks and stalls, a sharp reduction in 
the numbers of which has, nevertheless, been prescribed. The 
kiosks that remain will be permitted to trade only in the 
traditional "Soviet" range of goods -- tobacco, nonalcoholic 
beverages, flowers, souvenirs, newspapers. Industrial 
commodities and food will be prohibited. An exception has been 
made only for fruit. So pineapples will stay. But no hazel 
hens. 
  Everything else must without fail be shifted in the 
direction 
of flea markets. The 70 Moscow municipal markets that already 
exist will be added to by a further eight this year. There will 
be free entry to the markets for customers. Anyone who pays 
will be permitted to trade. Commercial bus routes will be 
organized for traders. The lease periods for plots of land for 
flea markets will be increased. Prohibitions cover trade in 
weapons, military commodities, precious metals, animals, plants, 
children's goods, currency, and securities. 
  We will still have to experience some inconveniences. You 
will no longer be able to buy the commodity you need right next 
to your apartment block. But this can be endured for the sake 
of cleanliness and order. Things will be appreciably worse only 
for the grandmothers, but they, who have not yet forgotten 
Soviet reality, cannot get into the habit.

<F P=106> [Article by Sharip Asuyev, Said Bipoyev, and Aleksandr </F>
Yevtushenko; date, place of quoted interviews not given: 
"Chechnya: Entreaties and Guns. What Language Will Moscow and 
Groznyy Use?"] 
  [Text] From an interview with Dzhokhar Dudayev: 
  [Dudayev] Two years ago the Chechen republic acquired its 
independence. But even now one can say with confidence that my 
presidency and our state are coming into being in very 
precarious conditions . Although even in these conditions there 
is no doubt that the state does exist. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is your opinion of the activity 
of law-enforcement bodies? Do you not think that you are to 
blame for the disorganization there? 
  [Dudayev] This is a problem not only for us but also 
throughout the former Union. We have adopted a government 
program for combating crime during the transitional period. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What about the parliament? Does it 
or does it not exist? 
  [Dudayev] The deputies are still meeting. (We would remind 
you that a few months before the tragic events in Moscow the 
same kind of crisis blew up in Chechnya when Dudayev used force 
against the opposition in order to retain power. Over 50 people 
died then -- editorial note). They are putting all the 
parliament's previous work on a legal footing. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What mistakes have you made during 
your rule? What reasons do you have to reproach yourself? 
  [Dudayev] We are a nation today. And the people who trust 
in me -- around 80 percent of the population support me -- are 
convincing evidence that I have not committed flagrant mistakes 
that they regret. I do not know of a single state that does not 
want to cooperate with us. So we are pursuing the right policy. 
  But we cannot agree to the terrorism that is being foisted 
on 
us by Russia's leadership. We have given no cause for it, and 
are not about to. Terrorism is for the weak. We cannot live in 
isolation, especially from Russia. But that is what is being 
imposed on us, as it was on Albania and Cuba in the past. They 
want to create unbearable conditions here so as to arouse 
people's indignation and cause the overthrow of the "Dudayev 
regime." There is a 100-percent probability that Russia will 
try to "have it out" by force with recalcitrant Chechnya. 
Russia can do nothing else. When has it refrained from 
resolving national issues by force? That is its downfall. 
[Dudayev ends] 
  From an interview with Yaragi Mamodayev, leader of the 
Chechen opposition and head of the government of people's 
confidence: 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is your view of the situation in 
Chechnya today? 
  [Mamodayev] To put it briefly, it is worse than in other 
regions of the North Caucasus. There are virtually no state 
deliveries. Industry -- the backbone of the national economy -- 
is coming to a standstill. The petroleum complex is on its last 
legs. Agriculture has been paralyzed, and most educational 
establishments have been closed down. The republic's population 
has been reduced to poverty amid wholesale unemployment. And 
the few people who are in work have not seen wages for months, 
just as pensioners have not seen pensions. Moreover there is a 
terrible crime situation, with robberies and banditry. In a 
word, there is every sign that we have not a regime, as many 
people think, but absolute powerlessness and anarchy. 
  As for Dudayev's regime, there is a Chechen Constitution 
which he has flagrantly violated. There is also a ruling by our 
Constitutional Court deeming the president's actions illegal. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is the reason for your long stay 
in Moscow? 
  [Mamodayev] In theory any of us can go to Groznyy when 
necessary and stay there are long as necessary. We have simply 
moved away from the republic's internal problems and 
concentrated our efforts on resolving foreign policy tasks, in 
other words we are working on the future. 
  In Moscow it is easier for us to establish contacts with 
Russian leaders and afford the republic real assistance. At the 
same time we are following the general course of building an 
independent Chechen state, which accords with the will of our 
people. 
  We realize that the process of acquiring a new state system 
is a long and complex one. It cannot be accomplished on 
impulse, by arrogant lunges. It is Russia that plays the key 
part in recognizing our independence. And we are now seeking 
ways to stabilize the situation at Caucasus-wide, regional level 
-- which in turn will ease the lot of the Chechen Republic. In 
order for this to occur it is primarily necessary to secure 
unequivocal rejection of strong-arm pressure on Chechnya. 
Dudayev is doing everything to cause bloodshed in the republic 
-- either by provoking civil war or by causing Chechnya to fall 
out with Russia. You get the impression that Chechnya's present 
rulers do not understand what they are doing or what kind of 
violence they are perpetrating against the people. Yet Dudayev 
is still saying: "I have the support of 80 percent of the 
population." He could cite a figure of 99 percent just as 
successfully. It costs him nothing and commits him to nothing. 
[Mamodayev ends] 
  From the life of the Chechen republic: 
  Eight people died and several were wounded in an exchange of 
fire between two groups in the center of the Chechen capital. 
The reason for the "shoot-out" was a long-standing financial 
dispute: One side owed the other a large sum of money. A third 
force -- a group run by one Labazanov, the local "authority" -- 
ended up embroiled in the conflict. Of late it has acted as 
arbiter in such contentious situations. Labazanov turned up 
with an armed crew of around 20 people. The "home team" lost 
four men, the attackers lost two. Labazanov himself was 
wounded. Immediately after the clash his comrades in arms 
brought him to the hospital in an ambulance where, after 
"releasing" all the other patients, they posted a strong guard 
throughout the premises, including men with machine guns on the 
roof. 
  Their fears were unfounded. Labazanov is a well-known figure 
in Chechnya. His popularity in some circles is rivaled only by 
the president's. Moreover they are worthy of one another. A 
former sportsman and boxing master of sport, from the start of 
the Chechen revolution Labazanov found himself on the 
barricades. His subsequent activity is shrouded in mystery. 
Although on paper he and his team rank as presidential 
structures. 
  According to reports from Groznyy, there is total confusion 
among the leaders of the republic's relatively sound farms. The 
reason being not the economy but crime. A crime wave has swept 
through rural areas of Chechnya, with agricultural producers 
being shot and blackmailed and their enterprises being robbed. 
Gangs masked in camouflage gear "national guard-style" are 
rifling through cattle pens, farms, and grain stores. Country 
people are having to organize self-defense detachments. 
Sheltering behind national interests, clan thugs are living 
with the threat of reprisals from non-Chechen leaders. And 
their recalcitrant patrons are "punished according to the law of 
the mountains." Thus one night "Sarysuyskiy" Sovkhoz Director 
Yanali Deniyev was killed with an assault rifle, "Rossiya" 
Kolkhoz Chairman Iosif Nisanov was shot with a machinegun, and 
Boris Yerik, chairman of the "Terek" Joint-Stock Company," was 
carted off somewhere from a team meeting. 
  Meanwhile Dudayev is once again shuffling the leaders of the 
power structures: He has sacked the general prosecutor and 
replaced the internal affairs minister, the head of the criminal 
police department, the chairman of the Supreme Court.... 
  While policemen chase old ladies through bazaars to combat 
speculation, the state security service is "watching over" 
"enemies of the Chechen people" in the opposition; criminal 
proceedings are being instituted against the boss fighting 
organized crime, whom the regime considers undesirable. The 
unknown troublemaker who fired a grenade thrower at the 
presidential palace was evidently the parting shot here.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Shapiro report in the "Russian Lieutenant Colonel </F>
Arrested in Chechnya" column: "The Chechen Side Considers the 
Detainee a Saboteur"] 
  [Text] Yesterday INTERFAX, citing Sultan Geliskhanov, 
chief of the Chechnya State Security Department, reported that 
on 29 April department officers detained a Russian lieutenant 
colonel on the territory of the Chechen Republic. The detainee 
allegedly admitted his involvement in operations by Russian 
special services on the territory of the Chechen Republic. No 
details of the detention are disclosed. 
  The CHECHEN PRESS AGENCY told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's 
correspondent that no information about the detention of a 
Russian lieutenant colonel was filed through their channels, but 
an agency official noted that "there are plenty of spies in 
Chechnya." The fact that a former KGB lieutenant colonel was 
detained on the territory of Chechnya was confirmed by Chechen 
Republic Press Minister Movladi Udugov, who said that 
documentary evidence was obtained about the detainee's 
involvement in organizing terrorist acts in Chechnya. Mr. 
Udugov, however, refused to provide further details of the case. 
Russian special services officials also declined to confirm the 
detention of a Russian lieutenant colonel on the territory of 
the Chechen Republic.

*) index of physical volume of industrial production calculated 
for an established set of representative goods 
**) according to preliminary calculations 
***) in percentages of March of last year 
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  The physical volume of industrial production during the 
first 
quarter of 1994 as compared to January-March of last year 
decreased by 29.6 percent, including in the processing 
branches--by 29.9 percent, and in the extraction branches it 
increased by 3.9 percent. 
  During January-March of this year enterprises reduced output 
of products by more than one-third in the cities of Babarinsk, 
Iskitim, Kuybyshev, and Tatarsk, and in Vengerovskiy, 
Dovolenskiy, Karasukskiy, Kupinskiy, Kolyvanskiy, Moshkovskiy, 
Ordynskiy, Suzunskiy, Severnyy, Chanovskiy, Chulymskiy, and 
Chistoozernyy Rayons. 
  The scale of the reduction of the physical volume of 
production during January-March of this year differed 
significantly in the various branches: In ferrous 
metallurgy--about 65 percent; nonferrous metallurgy, the 
chemical and petrochemical industry, machine-building, 
milling-cereal and manufactured concentrated feed industry--from 
41 to 48 percent; light industry, the timber, wood processing, 
and the pulp and paper industry, and the construction materials 
industry--from 31 to 39 percent; and the food industry--14 
percent. 
  Production decreased as follows: 
  --in the fuel industry: coal (by 5.1 percent); 
  -in electric energy engineering: hydroelectric energy (by 
11.9 percent); 
  --ferrous metallurgy: finished rolled metal (80.4 percent), 
nonrusting sheet steel (57.2 percent), rolled sheet metal (83.8 
percent), cold rolled steel belts (74.8 percent), steel (45.8 
percent), ferrous metals (80.9 percent), seamless pipes (90.8 
percent), and electric welded items (60.4 percent); 
  --in machine building: metal cutting machine tools (by 37 
percent), wood processing (68.9 percent), looms (48.5 percent), 
large electrical machinery (53.2 percent), electric furnaces (50 
percent), tractor seeders (78.2 percent), and concrete mixers 
(90.1 percent); 
  --in the chemical industry: flexible polyvinyl chloride 
(15.7 
percent), plasticizers (47.8 percent), synthetic resins and 
plastics (82.5 percent), and polymer film (62.8 percent); 
  --in the timber and wood processing industry: shipments of 
commercial timber (65.8 percent) and lumber (33.2 percent); 
  --in the construction materials industry: cement (57.6 
percent), ceramic sanitation items (45.3 percent), panels for 
large-panel housing construction (55.4 percent), prefabricated 
reinforced concrete items (33.3 percent), asbestos cement sheets 
(91.4 percent), and heating radiators and convectors (49.1 
percent). 
  The actual volume of production during the first quarter of 
this year increased in the fuel industry (by 9.4 percent) and 
electric energy (by 7 percent). In the oblast as a whole 57 
industrial enterprises provided for an increase in production 
volumes (17.1 percent of the overall number). 
  Taking into account the average daily production in March of 
this year as compared to February of this year there was an 
increase in the production of coal, hydroelectric energy, 
electric steel, finished rolled metal, steel pipes, cold rolled 
steel strips, flexible polyvinyl chloride, prefabricated 
reinforced concrete items, radiators and convectors for heating, 
and ceramic items for sanitation. 
  During January-March of this year there was a considerable 
reduction of the production of consumer goods--by 33.9 percent, 
including nonfoodstuffs--by 39.2 percent, which included light 
industry goods--34.4 percent, foodstuffs--24.5 percent, wine and 
liquor items and beer--46 percent. The production of individual 
kinds of foodstuffs is characterized by the following data:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  During January-March of this year the output of prepared 
cotton fabrics and washing machines increased. 
  The output of leather, fulled, and felt footwear, electric 
mixers, tape recorders, television sets, clocks, wallpaper, 
speakers, and general-purpose notebooks increased by more than 
one- third. Among the wine and liquor items there was a 
considerable reduction of the production of vodka and 
liquor-vodka items (by 57.7 percent) and grape wine (by 59.6 
percent). 
  During the first quarter of this year the production of 
products for defense purposes in comparable prices decreased by 
32.8 percent. 
  The proportion of military products in the overall volume of 
oblast production in comparable prices in March of this year 
amounted to 9 percent. 
  The decline of the overall output of industrial products at 
converted enterprises during the three months of this year 
amounted to 44.4 percent, including defense products--29.5 
percent. 
  During January-March of this year the number of industrial 
production personnel in the oblast decreased by 12.4 percent, 
including at converted enterprises--19.1 percent. There was a 
growth of the number of personnel in electric energy engineering 
(by 6.9 percent) and nonferrous metallurgy (by 1.2 percent). 
The greatest reduction was in machine building and metal 
processing (by 18.8 percent), the medical industry (11.7 
percent), and the timber and wood processing industry (11.4 
percent). 
  The reduction of labor productivity amounted to 24.5 
percent, 
including at converted enterprises--31.3 percent. 
  There was a growth of labor productivity in the fuel 
industry 
(by 15.6 percent), the timber and wood processing industry (by 2 
percent), and the microbiological industry (by 48.5 percent). 
  Losses of working time are increasing because of the 
prolonged shutdowns of enterprises. During March of this year 
75 industrial enterprises had production shutdowns and losses of 
working time amounted to 471,300 man-days or 16.5 percent of the 
scheduled supply of working time of these enterprises (in March 
of last year: 31 enterprises lost 70,900 man-days or 4.4 percent 
of the scheduled working time of these enterprises). Four 
enterprises fully halted their production for more than one 
shift and losses amounted to 29,800 man-days (6.3 percent of the 
overall losses of working time). 
  The main ones to stand idle were enterprises of machine 
building and metal processing, the chemical industry, and the 
construction materials industry. 
  Enterprises are halting their production because of 
difficulties with the sale of products, shortage of material 
resources, and other factors. Because of shutdowns or 
transition to different work schedules in March of this year 595 
workers were discharged from 75 enterprises and 24,742 people 
were furloughed on the initiative of the administration. 
  During the first quarter of this year 42 percent of the 
industrial enterprises were included in the nonstate form of 
ownership. A large share of the enterprises of the nonstate 
sector are joint-stock companies (87 percent). 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  Agricultural commodity producers are preparing the material 
base for planting. 
  As of the beginning of April they had made ready 75 percent 
of the tractors, 73 percent of the trucks, 69 percent of the 
seeders, 79 percent of the tractor plows, and 73 percent of the 
cultivators. The rates of repair of all kinds of agricultural 
equipment are below last year's. 
  During the past quarter agricultural enterprises have 
shipped 
in 44,000 tonnes of diesel fuel and 15,800 tonnes of gasoline, 
which is less than last year by 33 and 27 percent. The 
provision of diesel fuel as of the beginning of the second 
quarter is 38 percent below last year's and gasoline--19 percent. 
  The situation in animal husbandry on farms with the 
collective- shared form of ownership continues to grow worse. 
The number of cattle and hogs has decreased by 10.3 percent as 
compared to the corresponding period of 1993, including cows--7 
percent, sheep--31.6 percent, horses--7.5 percent, and 
poultry--0.2 percent. 
  During the first quarter of this year the farms sold for 
slaughter 29,800 tonnes of cattle and poultry, produced 130,300 
tonnes of milk, and obtained 126.3 million eggs. As compared to 
the corresponding period of 1993 there was a reduction of meat 
production by 9,400 tonnes (23.8 percent), and milk--40,200 
tonnes (23.6 percent); but more eggs were received than last 
year by 6.3 million or 5.3 percent. The average milk yield per 
cow as of the beginning of the year was 348 kilograms during 
January-March as compared to 421 during January-March of last 
year. In March the milk yield per cow dropped by 29 kilograms 
and amounted to 144 kilograms. One laying hen produced 54 eggs 
as compared to 56 during the first quarter of last year. 
  During the three months the farms obtained 146,600 calves, 
109,900 piglets, and 117,900 lambs. The use of the reproduction 
herd of cattle and sheep improved. Since the beginning of the 
year 34,800 head of cattle, 29,900 hogs, and 17,700 sheep have 
died. The maintenance of all kinds of cattle has deteriorated 
as compared to the corresponding period of last year. 
  During the three months 22,500 head of livestock and 
poultry, 
80,600 tonnes of milk, and 105.2 million eggs were delivered to 
state resources. As compared to the same period of last year 
procurements of cattle and poultry decreased by 33 percent, 
milk--by 32 percent, and eggs--by 1 percent. Additionally, the 
farms sold in the markets, through their own stores, and through 
public catering 4,800 tonnes of cattle, 4,200 tonnes of milk, 
and 1.7 million eggs. 
<H5>  Capital Construction </H5>
  During the first quarter of 1994 R116.9 billion in capital 
investments were assimilated (64 percent of the amount for 
January- March 1993), of which R20.8 million came from the 
republic budget (18 percent of the overall volume of capital 
investments) and R11.4 billion from local budgets (10 percent). 
  The greatest proportion of assimilated capital investments 
was at state and municipal enterprises (65 percent) and 
joint-stock companies (34 percent). 
  For construction of facilities for production purposes from 
all sources of financing R68.2 billion in capital investments 
was assimilated, including at facilities for producing consumer 
goods-- R1.2 billion or 1.7 percent. 
  In the oblast as a whole R27.3 billion in capital 
investments 
were assimilated in housing construction, the construction of 
general educational schools--R0.8 billion, preschool 
institutions-- R0.3 billion, hospitals and outpatient polyclinic 
institutions--R1.0 billion, and clubs and houses of 
culture--R0.03 billion. 
  During the first quarter of 1994 the 
Zatsibselelektrosetstroy 
Trust put electric power transmission lines with a distance of 8 
kilometers into operation. 
  From all sources of financing R8.6 billion worth of fixed 
capital was put into operation in the oblast, of which R6.5 
billion was at facilities for production purposes. 
  During the first quarter of 1994, 274 apartments with an 
overall area of 16,600 square meters were put into operation in 
the oblast from all sources of financing, which amounted to 15 
percent of the 
level of the corresponding period of last year. 
  As before, most of the volume of housing construction was 
carried out by state and municipal enterprises and organizations 
(65 percent of the overall introduction of housing). Individual 
builders introduced 1,800 square meters (11 percent) using their 
own funds or with the help of state credit. 
  During January-March of this year the following were put 
into 
operation: a kindergarten to accommodate 140 by the Pobeda AOZT 
[private joint-stock company] in the village of Kargapolova in 
Suzunskiy Rayon, and a club to accommodate 100 by the Sibir AOZT 
in the settlement of Krasnyy Khutor in Krasnozerskiy Rayon. 
  All construction organizations on the territory of the 
oblast 
during January-March of this year performed R112.1 billion worth 
of contracting work through their own forces, and the volume 
dropped by 41 percent as compared to the corresponding period of 
last year. 
  The main volume of contracting work (R67.8 billion or 61 
percent) was performed by enterprises with a mixed form of 
ownership, R26.2 billion (23 percent)--by private enterprises, 
and R18.2 billion (16 percent)--by state and municipal 
enterprises. 
  In the structure of contracting work performed, construction 
and installation work makes up 86 percent. Capital repair and 
other contracting work accounts for 14 percent of the volume 
performed. 
  Contracting organizations performed R6.2 billion worth of 
work on the construction of the facilities of the 
agro-industrial complex, which was 6 percent of the overall 
volume of contracting work. 
<H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>
  Under the conditions of the decline of production and the 
continuing growth of prices the volume of freight shipments by 
general purpose transportation is continually decreasing. Thus 
during the first quarter of 1994 the volume of shipments of 
freight by general purpose transportation decreased by 36.4 
percent as compared to the first quarter of 1993, and cargo 
turnover--by 33.2 percent. 
  On the Western Siberian Railroad the volume of freight 
dispatched decreased by 26.3 percent, and the delivery of timber 
cargo decreased by 59.1 percent, petroleum cargo--by 32.5 
percent, and grain and milling products--by 51.9 percent. Cargo 
turnover decreased by 31.7 percent or 12.6 tonne-kilometers. 
  A considerable increase in rates for freight shipment 
because 
of the sharp increase in fuel prices has led many consumers to 
refrain from the services of general purpose automotive 
transportation. As a result, during the first quarter of this 
year this kind of transportation was used to ship 2.1 million 
tonnes of freight, which is 47.6 percent less than during the 
first quarter of last year, and cargo turnover decreased by 46.4 
percent. In addition to general purpose automotive 
transportation, freight was shipped by 64 automotive enterprises 
of other ministries and departments and they shipped 29.2 
million tonnes of freight. 
  The situation with automotive transportation service for 
citizens continues to be strained. Passenger departures from 
airports of civil aviation decreased by 40.2 percent during the 
first quarter. Some of the passenger flow shifted to the 
relatively less expensive rail transportation, where passenger 
transportation increased by 2.9 percent, but passenger turnover 
decreased by 13.4 percent. Transportation of passengers by 
automotive transportation increased by 6.3 percent, including 
general purpose transportation--by 6.9 percent, and passenger 
turnover--by 1.2 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively. 
  Revenues of communications enterprises during the first 
quarter of this year amounted to R10.1 billion, including from 
the sale of services to the population--R2.1 billion. 
<H5>  Development of Foreign Trade Relations </H5>
  During the first quarter 32 enterprises and organizations 
entered the foreign market. They exported R15.4 billion worth 
of machines, equipment, raw materials, processed materials, and 
consumer goods and services. Ferrous metallurgy products and 
items made from them amounted to R1.1 billion (7.1 percent of 
the overall volume), inorganic chemistry products--4.1 billion 
(26.6 percent), and tin and items made from it--R2.4 billion 
(15.6 percent). The main exporters, which made up more than 75 
percent of the overall number, are four enterprises: the 
Khimkontsentratov Joint-Stock Company--2.6 percent (R4.1 
billion), the tin combine--20.5 percent (R3.2 billion), the 
Elsib AOOT [public joint-stock company]--8.8 percent (R1.4 
billion), and the Institute of Nuclear Physics--19.5 percent (R3 
billion). 
  Foreign trade turnover through direct production ties and 
commodity exchange operations amounted to $32.4 million 
(exports-- $19 million and imports--$13.4 million). More than 
60 percent was commodity turnover with Germany, Great Britain, 
China, France, and the United States. 
<H5>  The Consumer Market </H5>
  The volume of retail commodity turnover of officially 
registered trade organizations of the oblast during 
January-March reached R295 billion and increased 6.5-fold as 
compared to the corresponding period of last year (in actual 
prices). The physical mass of goods sold was 24.9 percent less. 
During the report month there was a 0.8-percent increase in the 
volume of commodity turnover as compared to March of last year. 
  The proportion of sales of foodstuffs in the overall volume 
of commodity turnover amounted to 51 percent as against 54.2 
percent 
during the first quarter of 1993. 
  The commodity turnover of public catering enterprises 
amounted to R17.6 billion and increased 5.2-fold as compared to 
the corresponding period of last year (in actual prices). Its 
proportion in the overall volume of commodity turnover decreased 
from 7.4 percent to 6 percent. 
  Enterprises of the nonstate sector in trade and public 
catering since the beginning of the year have provided for 48.8 
percent of the overall volume of commodity turnover. The state 
sector accounts for 39.5 percent, and consumers' 
cooperation--11.7 percent. 
  As of the beginning of April commodity reserves in trade 
organizations amounted to R117 billion. Their provision, 
calculated in days of trading, amounted to 40 days (in the first 
quarter of 1993--50 days). 
  During January-February of this year as compared to the 
corresponding period of last year there was an increase in sales 
of herring, margarine products, cheese, knitwear, hosiery items, 
leather footwear, and television sets. 
  There were decreased sales of meat, sausage items, fish, 
butter and vegetable oil, eggs, sugar, confectionery items, 
fabrics, sewn items, soap and detergents, and radio receivers. 
  The volume of paid services during the first quarter of this 
year amounted to R70.7 billion with an average of R25,200 per 
resident. As compared to last year it increased 12.9-fold in 
actual prices. 
  The volume of consumer services rendered to the population 
was R6.1 billion. This is 8.6 percent of the overall volume of 
paid services (during January-March 1993--16.4 percent). 
  In the sphere of rendering services to the population, 
nonstate enterprises account for 20.7 percent of the overall 
volume of services. 
<H5>  Finances </H5>
  According to figures from the administration of finance and 
tax policy of the oblast administration, the consolidated oblast 
budget during January-February 1994 was fulfilled for incomes 
and expenditures in the amount of R99.7 billion. 
  The largest proportion of revenues is made up of value added 
tax--25.2 percent, individual income tax--20.4 percent, and 
profit tax--19.7 percent. 
  The basic directions for financing are still sociocultural 
measures and the development of the economy. In budget 
expenditures during January-February 1994 expenditures on 
sociocultural measures make up 58 percent and on the development 
of the economy--28 percent. 
  Enterprises and organizations of the oblast (not including 
agricultural) during January-March 1994, according to 
preliminary calculations, received profit in a volume of R250 
billion. Industry accounts for 88 percent of the profit, 
construction--8 percent, and transportation--2 percent. As 
compared to the corresponding period of last year the volume of 
profit increased 4.3-fold while the prices of industrial 
products increased 8.6-fold. 
  The financial position of enterprises and organizations 
continues to be complicated by the lack of regulation of mutual 
settlements in the national economy. 
  The overall creditor indebtedness at enterprises of 
industry, 
construction, transportation, and agriculture as of 1 March of 
this year amounted to R684.6 billion, including 
defaulted--R266.7 billion or 38.9 percent. 
  In the overall total of defaulted creditor indebtedness of 
these branches, defaulted indebtedness to suppliers accounts for 
R174.1 billion or 65.3 percent, and the budget--R45.2 billion or 
17 percent. More than 66 percent of the defaulted indebtedness 
to suppliers (nonpayments) are to enterprises of industry. 
  As of 1 March this year all of the accounts receivable 
amounted to R654.1 billion, of which the defaulted amount was 
R331 billion or 50.6 percent. Almost 90 percent of the 
defaulted accounts receivable is defaulted indebtedness for 
products delivered, work performed, and services rendered 
(R295.7 billion). Of the overall total of defaulted 
indebtedness of consumers, R227.5 (76.9 percent) is to 
industrial enterprises. 
  The shortage of their own financial resources forces 
enterprises to use credit and loans. Indebtedness on loans and 
credit received from banks as of 1 March of this year amounted 
to R166.7 billion, of which R15.3 billion is defaulted. 
  The volume of defaulted indebtedness for issuing funds for 
consumption for enterprises and organizations of industry, 
construction, and agriculture amounted to R30.7 billion as of 1 
April 1994. 
  Among industrial goods the most significant price increases 
were for medications--1.8-fold, gasoline and printed 
publications--1.7- fold, private means of 
transportation--1.5-fold, and detergents and jewelry 
items--1.4-fold. 
  The greatest rate of price increases was found for paid 
services rendered to the population, which was brought about by 
the sharp increase in the cost of housing and municipal 
services. Since the beginning of the year housing services have 
increased in cost 224- fold, communications--2.3-fold, rail 
transportation--twofold, automotive transportation--1.6-fold, 
and services for keeping children and children's preschool 
institutions--1.6-fold. 
  The growth of consumer prices was influenced by the higher 
wholesale prices in industry, which, in turn, was linked to the 
increase in expenditures on the production of products (higher 
costs 
of raw materials, processed materials, energy resources, and 
fuel). 
  During the first quarter of this year wholesale prices for 
food industry products increased 33 percent, including 
butter--59 percent, wine making products--38 percent, and 
confectionery items- 27 percent. Light industry products 
increased in cost by 32 percent during this same period, 
including footwear--72 percent, cotton fabrics--37 percent, and 
knitted items--23 percent. 
<H5>  Incomes and Expenditures of the Population </H5>
  During January-March of this year monetary incomes of the 
population amounted to R502 billion and increased 6.5-fold as 
compared to the same period of 1993. 
  During March of this year nominal monetary incomes totalled 
R190 billion. As compared to February they increased 10 
percent, and compared to March 1993--6.1-fold. At the same time 
the real disposable monetary incomes (income minus mandatory 
payments and contributions adjusted to the price index), which 
reflect the dynamics of the buying power of the current monetary 
incomes, decreased in March 1994 as compared to the preceding 
month by 0.4 percent, and as compared to March 1993--by 24 
percent. 
  With the increase in prices there is also an increase in the 
amount of the subsistence level which, according to methods 
approved by the Ministry of Labor of Russia, as of 1 April 1994 
amounted to R55,220 on average per capita. 
  The average monthly wages of workers during January-March of 
this year amounted to R130,000 and increased 9.4-fold as 
compared to the corresponding period of last year. 
  Monetary expenditures of the population during January-March 
1994 amounted to R528 billion (8.2 times more than during 
January-March 1993), including for the purchase of goods and 
paid services--R363 billion (6.8-fold). 
<H5>  Public Health </H5>
  During January-March of this year there was an increase in 
the number of registered infectious and parasitic diseases as 
compared to the corresponding period of 1993, the number of 
reported cases of diphtheria increased 10-fold, German 
measles--7.4-fold, salmonella infections--twofold, and 
influenza--1.8-fold. 
  There was a certain decrease in the number of reported cases 
of colitis, enteritis, gastroenteritis, and food poisoning with 
established etiology (from 342 to 293), critical intestinal 
infections caused by unestablished infectious agents (from 1,782 
to 1,553), chicken pox (from 4,636 to 4,036), and viral 
hepatitis A (from 694 to 542). 
<H5>  The Crime Situation </H5>
  According to data from the oblast internal affairs 
administration, during January-March of this year 17,800 crimes 
were reported, including 700 (4 percent)--against individuals, 
2,000 (11.2 percent)--against state and public property, and 
12,500 (70 percent)--against private and personal property. 
Criminal charges were brought against 7,600 individuals. 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  Since the beginning of privatization 1,460 packages of 
documents have been filled out for enterprises of all branches, 
and 1,284 enterprises have been fully privatized, including 142 
in 1994. 
  Most of the privatized enterprises (59.3 percent) are 
municipally owned enterprises, 23.5 percent--federally owned, 
and 17.2 percent-- oblast-owned enterprises. During 1994 these 
figures were 27.5 percent, 42.9 percent, and 29.5 percent, 
respectively. 
  On the territory of the oblast 419 joint-stock companies 
have 
been created, including 233 on the basis of federally owned 
enterprises. At commercial competitions 524 enterprises have 
been sold and 287 enterprises have purchased leased property. 
  A total of R14.8 billion has been obtained from 
privatization, R2 billion of which in 1994. 
  Earnings from privatization of municipally owned facilities 
amounted to R7.4 billion (50.7 percent of the total received), 
and oblast-owned--R1.6 billion. 
  Name-bearing privatization checks were used to obtain R6.5 
billion worth, including R1 billion in 1994. 
  Of the monies received from privatization, R7.9 billion was 
transferred into budgets and funds, and R3.5 billion (43.9 
percent)--into local budgets. 
  Since the beginning of privatization in buildings of the 
state and municipal housing fund, 138,300 apartments have been 
privatized, including 12,400 in 1994. 
  As of 1 April this year in the rayon committees for land 
reform 5,999 peasant (farmer-run) farms have been registered, 
and they were assigned 344,100 hectares of land. There are 57.4 
hectares per one farm. Since 1 January 1992, 603 farms have 
ceased their activity for various reasons.

  [Text] The country's first duty-free zone [svobodnaya 
tamozhennaya zona] is to be set up in Maritime Kray near the 
Russo-Chinese border. 
  Unlike ordinary duty-free zones, this zone will be a border 
territory, where imports can be brought in and stockpiled 
without payment of duty. Profit from the deal between buyer and 
seller will go to the local administration budget and to the 
Customs Administration account. It is also planned to organize 
processing facilities within the duty-free zone. It is proposed 
that the customs zone be located on the site of a loss-making 
enterprise in Ussuriysk city. The zone will make it possible 
for Maritime Kray to become a major staging post for foreign 
capital on Russia's Pacific seaboard.

<F P=106> [Interview with Maritime Kray Administration Head Yevgeniy </F>
Nazdratenko by Nina Rostarchuk: date and place not stated: 
"The Road to Russia Runs Through Maritime Kray"] 
  [Text] The Kray Soviet session was prepared to examine two 
questions: one, to confirm the head of the Kray Administration, 
and two, to establish a separate republic in Maritime Kray. 
  Yevgeniy Ivanovich Nazdratenko heard out the first question 
as a guest. But nowadays he gets up onto the platform as 
governor of that huge and "remote region, which is nevertheless 
our own" and proposes removing the question of a "separate" 
republic from the agenda. Now, and forever more! 
  Yevgeniy Ivanovich Nazdratenko begins our conversation in an 
unexpectedly abrupt manner. 
  [Nazdratenko] I am categorically against splintering Russia 
into tiny principalities. And you know, I am not a stray 
"commie." It is painful to stand by and watch as people pilfer 
Russia bit by bit, instead of living in a united country, a 
single economic area, under one authority and one president. 
The idea of sovereignties may well be high-minded, tempting, 
and sweet, but there is nothing behind it once you begin to 
consider not your own ambitions but the people who have 
entrusted you with power. 
  So what exactly is today's Maritime Kray? Is it Russia's 
eastern gate, its outpost on the Pacific coast, as it is 
commonly described? No, it is first and foremost an enormous 
territory lorded over for many long years by government 
departments; and now we are being forced to disentangle the 
results of their specific style of management. 
  The first of these results is plain for all to see: in our 
region, a loaf of bread costs 1,000 rubles [R]. The average 
wage in the kray is R80,000. Don't look so surprised: Living 
standards in the Far East have always been lower than the 
average for the country. And now we are divided by a veritable 
abyss. The same loaf of bread costs R100 in Altay. Because 
they have their own grain there, whereas our environmental 
conditions are completely different. We have to import 
everything. As long as we have to import, for instance, grain, 
it is becoming so expensive that, but for subsidies, a loaf of 
bread would cost around R7,000 in the stores. 
  This is the most serious question which we are trying to 
resolve today. I can see how this can be done, but I hear 
warnings from all sides: Whatever you do, do not get it into 
your head to buy grain abroad! By doing that you will destroy 
national grain producers! 
  I agree that it is essential to support our own producers. 
And when we were getting grain for R250,000 a tonne, we did 
just that. But "our boys" do not think about us! Railroad 
companies are again increasing charges for freight shipment, and 
the price of a tonne of grain has soared right up to R400,000! 
  So it was that we decided to construct a terminal at one of 
the ports and take delivery of Canadian hard wheat -- 6 million 
tonnes per year. Right away we were able to breathe more 
easily, because the imported wheat is a quarter of the cost. 
Moreover it is better quality than ours. The scraps from the 
grain milling industry can be used to make mixed feed to support 
livestock in the region. We have to survive. Unfortunately, 
the interests of the state are often at odds with the interests 
of the region. 
  [Rostarchuk] Maritime Kray has sufficient nuclear reserves 
to last 20-25 years. Five-meter high thickets of rushes are 
growing in waste water tanks. What does this indicate? Abnormal 
radiation levels, and a polluted environment. There are 
villages along the coast where it is no longer possible to live. 
For humanitarian reasons alone, people have to be removed from 
there and given a chance to settle elsewhere. But where? Where 
is that coveted paradise where people can expect work and 
lodgings? There is no such place in Maritime Kray. 
  [Nazdratenko] And it is in precisely this horrific 
ecological situation that people are starting to talk about a 
nuclear power station. I want none of it! Every fiber of my 
being opposes it. On the other hand, how can we extricate 
ourselves from the power crisis which erupted this winter across 
the entire Far East? In Magadan Oblast an entire city was iced 
up. We saw that tragedy with our own eyes: The Far East 
Shipping Company had to evacuate the inhabitants. We ourselves 
missed the worst of it, thank God, although we came close to the 
brink. Everything went into providing heat -- all budget funds 
went into this. Coal was brought into the region at any cost. 
Its price hit R115,000 a tonne. Just imagine how much went up 
in smoke, in the literal sense of the word: We burned money. 
Money which should have gone to the people, in the form of 
wages or to develop the budget-financed sphere. 
  In order to resolve the question of power supplies in 
Maritime Kray, it is essential to complete the construction of 
the Ussuriysk TETs [heat and electric power station]. To feed 
it we will expand the Rettikhovka, Pavlovka, and Luchegorsk 
coalfields. But it will take 20 years to do all the work. Of 
course, it will be completely impossible to manage without state 
help. And it is not very nice, believe me, to have to go cap in 
hand to somebody. But you know, we are only trying to "finagle" 
what is Maritime Kray's due. The abundance of energy generated 
by the Siberian GES [hydroelectric power station] cascade -- 
built, incidentally, by the whole country -- should cost R9 per 
kilowatt-hour. But they take R230 from Kamchatka. And a little 
less from Sakhalin -- R170. We have long tried to draw the 
government's attention to this problem, and at last we have 
forged a decree on stabilizing the kray economy. We now pay R40 
per kilowatt-hour.... But this is not the solution. I believe 
that average rates for the whole of the Russian Federation 
territory should be adopted. 
  [Rostarchuk] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, there is a nuance here.... 
Is it really the case that your ports process cargoes for 
Maritime Kray as such? No, these are cargoes for the whole of 
Russia. Maritime Kray comprises the major warehouse center for 
all Russia's regions. Is that not so? Some people are 
suggesting that you exploit the fact by levying a quit rent on 
anybody who uses your "gateway" and your land and use it to top 
up the local budget. 
  [Nazdratenko] But they must understand how this "local 
initiative" will turn out for other regions! In my view, it is 
better to impose order through civilized methods. And such 
methods do exist. Only, it is essential for the "upper 
echelons" to understand that the Far East has its own specifics 
and that what suits others does not necessarily suit it. You 
have to cross 12,000 km by rail to reach us, and this landscape 
is by no means the same type of landscape as that between Moscow 
and Ryazan. 
  It is vital to realize that, when airlines inflate ticket 
prices to R400,000 one-way, they are cutting Maritime Kray off 
from Russia. You try flying west to see your relatives or 
sending an expert there on a business trip! An intercity 
telephone link is an unthinkable luxury even for an enterprise, 
never mind an elderly grandmother stranded in Maritime Kray with 
no relatives! 
  All these things seem minor, but it is these things which 
shape an individual's life, and they affect his mood and his 
well-being. My fellow countrymen are feeling increasingly 
alienated from the main part of Russia, and that was not the 
case before. 
  But when I start talking about uniform rates for 
electricity, 
about preferential prices for air tickets and freight carriage, 
people instantly begin suspecting me of anti-market 
inclinations. But you know, many people are aware that at the 
end of the 1980's I fought for flotation, I was one of the first 
to set up an enterprise with a non-state form of ownership -- a 
mining enterprise in Dalnegorsk. I am not against reform. But 
who needs to float a "dead" industry? If subscribing for shares 
entails a 30- or 40-percent cut in the workforce, and people in 
that particular one-horse village or city have nowhere else to 
work, then, tell me, why bother floating it? 
  [Rostarchuk] Obviously, the heart of an industrialist 
still beats within you, and you are looking at Maritime Kray as 
a huge economic structure.... 
  [Nazdratenko] Of course, I am concerned about production and 
I am trying in every possible way to maintain it.... 
  The Law on Bankruptcy is completely incomprehensible to me. 
Take the "Zvezda" Plant -- a candidate for "mothballing".... 
The aviation plant in Arsenyev is barely breathing. They work 
for the Ministry of Defense; they fulfill its orders. But 
nobody is in any hurry to cover their production costs or the 
pay for people's labor. The same picture can be found at many 
enterprises. They operate at a loss purely because they are 
owed enormous sums of money. So pay them! Then they in turn 
can pay all their taxes, settle outstanding debts for 
electricity, and everything will take its course. 
  The only way out of all this turmoil of ours is authority 
within the country. It is wrong to expect the economy itself to 
"impose order"; production units are grinding to a halt one 
after the other. 
  I make no secret of my liking for Chernomyrdin, as it seems 
to me that he is the only person capable of leading the 
government now. There is no point in our being afraid of a 
regulated economy. It may well be worth fixing prices for 
energy sources, at any rate. This is not a return to old ways, 
but a necessity of the transition period. 
  [Rostarchuk] Nevertheless, Maritime Kray is unlikely to sit 
back and wait for charity from Moscow.... 
  [Nazdratenko] ...and "scramble out of the mess" ourselves? 
Right. We have started to work out a concept for the status and 
the development of the Maritime Kray. I am sure that this will 
be a "practicable" document. Experts from the Far East 
Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences are working on it. 
Whatever we devise, this is how we will live. The buck will 
not be passed to anybody else -- were we to embark on the wrong 
road, that is. Our region has many problems in common with 
Kamchatka, Magadan Oblast, Sakhalin, Khabarovsk. The Russian 
czar knew what he was doing when he unified these territories. 
And we have to unite. We must integrate, otherwise we will 
"end our days" having sold off our resources for a song just to 
put food on our tables. 
  [Rostarchuk] But is it really such a bad thing that foreign 
investments are now actively heading for the Far East? 
  [Nazdratenko] Not at all! I am very much in favor of 
developing cooperation. Nevertheless I prefer to do this on a 
legal basis, and the juridical side of this matter has still to 
be elaborated even now.... 
  In this sense we have a lot of work to do and we have a lot 
of potential. For all that, it seems to me that what is 
important now is that we turn not so much toward the east as 
toward the west. We yearn for Moscow, and we yearn to share the 
life of our country. And the fact that 76 percent of Maritime 
Kray inhabitants voted for the Russian Constitution proves that 
they are putting up with the current problems patiently, 
remaining loyal to their country and hoping that things will 
change for the better.

  [Text] Today participants in a meeting on Nagorno-Karabakh 
opened in Bishkek on May 4 at the initiative of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly started to discuss a protocol on a 
cease-fire in the zone of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. As

capital, the cease-fire is planned for May 9, 1994. 
  The meeting is attended by Chairman of the Armenian 
parliament Babken Ararktsyan, Deputy Chairman of the Azeri

Karabakh parliament Karen Baburyan, and mediators Chairman of 
the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly and the Russian Council of 
Federation Vladimir Shumeyko and Chairman of the Kyrgyz 
parliament Medetkan Sherimkulov. 
  As Sherimkulov told Interfax during a break that the talks

expressed hope that on Wednesday the sides will agree to sign 
the protocol. 
  As a well-informed source in the Azeri presidential 
administration told Interfax, Chairman of the Azeri parliament 
Rasul Guliyev failed to arrive in Bishkek due to the aggravation 
of the situation in the zone of the Karabakh conflict. The 
source said that Guliyev has been in the front line zone in the 
past few days.

  [Text] Bishkek 4 May TASS -- A working meeting of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly on Nagorno-Karabakh held in the 
Kyrgyz capital on Wednesday showed positive signs. After three 
hours of talks held behind closed doors Deputy Chairman [as 
received] of the Azeri Parliament Afiyaddin Dzhalilov answered 
journalists' questions. 
  "It is difficult to say yet whether any document will be 
signed during the meeting. A discussion about the withdrawal of 
Armenian armed formations from the Azeri territory, return of 
refugees and the establishment of a reliable ceasefire is 
underway," Dzhalilov said. 
  Chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly Vladimir 
Shumeyko said in a television interview that for the success of 
the talks Karabakh should be considered a party involved in the 
conflict. Asked about the attitude of the Azeri delegation to 
this statement, Dzhalilov pointed out that "we proceed from the 
assumption that the conflict has turned into a war and 
Azerbaijan and Armenia should settle it by peaceful means. What 
is at issue today is that the problem should not be "buried in 
sand" since the war is going on on the territory of Azerbaijan. 
A million refugees are living in tents. Therefore, common 
sense should prevail," Dzhalilov said.

<F P=106> [Report by KYRGYZKABAR correspondent Albert Bogdanov for </F>
TASS] 
  [Text] Bishkek, 4 May -- The talks on ways to settle the 
Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh began today in 
Kyrgyzstan's capital in the atmosphere of latent tension. The 
sides were ready to take issue on any minor point. Since 
Nagorno-Karabakh representatives were absent from the reception 
staged by President Askar Akayev before the start of the talks 
and its delegation did not get an opportunity to state its 
position at the morning session, one can understand the harsh 
assessment of the conference from Karen Baburyan, acting 
chairman of Armenia's Supreme Soviet, who said: "It could not be 
worse. If they make some decisions without Nagorno-Karabakh, 
all right, let them. But who then is to return the conquered 
territories?" 
  The first to speak was deputy chairman of Azerbaijan's 
Supreme Soviet Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, who categorically demanded 
an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of troops from the 
occupied territories. 
  The Armenian side reacted negatively to the fact that the 
chairman of Azerbaijan's Supreme Soviet did not turn up and that 
the meeting was attended by his deputy instead. [Armenian] 
Parliament Speaker Babken Ararktsyan stated in no uncertain 
terms that this strongly undermined the authority of the present 
meeting. He said it is hard to understand why Azerbaijan has 
not accepted measures proposed by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh 
to settle the conflict, even though it is to receive territories 
in return. He reiterated the words of President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan, contained in his message to the participants in 
the talks, to the effect that the sides' frequently repeated 
statements about peace do not bring peace and quiet to the area.

  [Text] Bishkek May 5 TASS -- Parliamentarians from Russia, 
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan and representatives of 
Nagorno-Karabakh worked late into the night on Wednesday [4 May] 
and resumed discussions early on Thursday morning to try and 
find a way around the stumbling block which, according to the 
leader of the Armenian parliamentary commission on 
Nagorno-Karabakh, Seiran Bagdasaryan, is formed by Azerbaijan's 
state policy rejecting the introduction of CIS peace-keepers and 
CSCE observers to the Karabakh region. 
  According to Bagdasaryan, Azerbaijan has not made up its 
mind 
concerning the main question about the disengagement of the 
warring forces. Only after the guns become silent, will it be 
possible to begin peace talks, bring back the refugees and 
exchange hostages. Azerbaijan is proposing a simple lull, but 
the situation is calling for the beginning of a lengthy process 
which can guarantee the non-resumption of combat activities, 
Bagdasaryan said. 
  Different variants of stationing peace-keeping forces have 
been proposed. In April the Azeri leader, President Heydar 
Aliyev refused to sign the resolution on the sending of CIS 
troops to the region approved by the CIS summit. At present the 
Azeri delegation is dragging feet in order not to sign a simple 
protocol, containing a call on the heads of state and 
parliaments to from CIS peace-keeping contingent and begin a 
peaceful dialogue. This is a practical attempt at hiding behind 
verbiage about Azerbaijan's sovereignty in an effort to avoid 
any solution to the Karabakh problem, Bagdasaryan said. 
  The Azers are again trying to use these talks in order to 
play for time, while they are preparing their troops for new 
offensive, the Armenian parliamentarian said. Political 
realities are now such that Azerbaijan will have to recognise 
Nagorno-Karabakh's independence. Policy can no longer be build 
on quantitative indices of the sort that there are seven million 
of Azers and only 150 thousand of Karabakh people. World 
experience shows that this is by far not the most decisive 
factor, Bagdasaryan said. He stressed his confidence that 
Azerbaijan would have to recognise Karabakh's independence 
earlier or later. 
  As concerns talks as a whole, Bagdasaryan said they are 
necessary because they help CIS parliamentarians to know each 
other better, clarify their respective positions and make steps 
towards peace. Meetings of this kind also help strengthen the 
CIS inter-parliamentary assembly, which is a promising process," 
the Armenian envoy said.

Algirdas Brazauskas came to his residence in Jurmala yesterday. 
The meeting was private. The presidents discussed the internal 
situation in the Baltic states and foreign policy issues. No 
documents were adopted. All three presidents agreed not to make 
a statement for the press. However, respecting the specific 
character of reporters' work, the president of our country 
[Latvia] decided to hold a small news conference. 
  Guntis Ulmanis said at Maikapara House today that the 
agreements signed between Latvia and Russia were discussed 
during the presidents' meeting. All the presidents of the 
Baltic states expressed the hope that the agreements concluded 
between Latvia and Russia would speed up the Russian Army 
withdrawal from Estonia. Ulmanis noted that a regular round of 
talks was held in Tallinn today. 
  The presidents of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia also 
discussed cooperation with those countries which expressed 
support for the agreements signed between Latvia and Russia. 
The agreements concluded have an important role in the 
stabilization of the Baltic states. The presidents expressed 
hope that Western countries which supported the process of 
drafting the agreements will continue to watch how they are 
implemented. 
  This evening at the president's residence, Guntis Ulmanis 
will meet ambassadors accredited in Latvia.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 4, ELTA -- The opinions about the 
policy of the Baltic countries towards Russia were not 
different, Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas said during 
the interview for the Lithuanian television and ELTA. 
  The relations of the Baltic countries with Russia alongside 
with other issues were discussed at the meeting of Estonian, 
Latvian and Lithuanian presidents on May 3 in Jurmala. 
  The meeting was arranged on the initiative of Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis. 
  Ulmanis informed the presidents about agreements between 
Latvia and Russia signed last week, the agreement on withdrawal 
of Russian troops among them. 
  It was emphasized during the meeting that efforts should be 
put forth to guarantee the carrying out of the agreements. The 
life showed that they not always were carried out by the Russian 
side. 
  Brazauskas said that they had discussed the work that had 
been done in the field of foreign policy after the meeting in 
Palanga on March 25. 
  Brazauskas informed the presidents about his visit to 
Strasbourg, the visit of Polish president to Lithuania and the 
Lithuanian-Polish treaty, which received positive evaluation 
from other Baltic presidents. 
  Brazauskas noted that the negotiations between Lithuania and 
Russia would soon be resumed. Russian experts have already been 
invited to Lithuania in order to promote the agreements in the 
fields of military transit. 
  Brazauskas expressed a hope that the agreements with Russia 
would be reached on the terms acceptable for both sides. 
  He also said that he was ready to discuss the arising 
problems directly with President Yeltsin. However, this meeting 
has not still be foreseen.

at the resort city of Cholpon-Ata on Lake Issyk-Kul's north 
shore. 
  The meeting was initiated by Askar Akayev, who, judging from 
unofficial sources, acted as a kind of "peace refereee between 
the leaders of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. After Nursultan 
Nazarbayev came out with the idea of a Eurasian union in Moscow 
it was abruptly rejected by Islam Karimov, specifically during a 
news conference in Tashkent when Francois Mitterrand's visit was 
going on here. 
  The Uzbek press severely criticized the neighboring state's 
leader: Having returned from Kirghizia, why did he, without 
consulting other participants in the trilateral treaty on a 
single economic area, propose that the old USSR be revived? 
Karimov observed, in particular, that on the shores of Lake 
Issyk-Kul they had agreed henceforth to act in a coordinated 
fashion before putting forward something within the CIS 
framework. In short, relations between Tashkent and Alma-Ata, 
which had cooled somewhat in recent weeks, were put right. 
  The three Central Asian republics' presidents signed a 
communique saying that the three leaders had briefed each other 
on the sociopolitical situation in their countries and discussed 
a wide range of questions concerning the general situation in 
the region and CIS as well as a number of international 
problems. The main result of the talks which took place, the 
joint communique notes, was that Kirghizia acceded to the treaty 
on creating a single economic area which was previously 
concluded between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The trilateral 
treaty on a single economic area between Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, 
and Uzbekistan completely conforms to the provisions of the 
treaty on creating an economic union of CIS countries, and it is 
open to all CIS states to join it. At the same time further 
progress toward economic cooperation, the communique says, 
requires a more active and constructive mechanism for 
collaboration. 
  The three Central Asian countries' presidents discussed 
specific measures to deal with the damage caused in Kirghizia 
during the current spring landslides, floods, and other natural 
disasters. Uzbekistan was the first to give the Kirghiz 
humanitarian aid by sending food, medicines, and tents. 
  While the presidents are seeking new ways to cooperate and 
to 
deepen integration, the first days of May have found thousands 
of people in Alma-Ata with cold gas stoves -- Uzbekistan has yet 
again reminded Kazakhstan of its debt for the delivery of gas 
and has stopped supplies. This is in the capital, while in 
certain oblasts there has been no gas in homes for months. 
Serious problems have occurred in Kazakhstan with fuels and 
lubricants too -- at the moment in Alma-Ata fuel is being 
supplied only to vehicles ensuring the city's security and vital 
activities, the militia, the ambulance service, and other 
special services.

<F P=106> [Boris Mkrtchyan report: "Tough Without Common Bank"] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan -- Armenian Prime Minister Hrant Bagratian 
has made a proposal to the CIS heads of government to set up a 
single interstate bank designed to carry out financial 
operations among the Commonwealth countries. This bank would 
also issue a monetary unit common to all of them. 
  The Armenian premier's explanation for his proposal is that, 
by introducing a national currency in their own country, the CIS 
countries cannot fail to use the Russian ruble as the sole means 
for interstate financial transactions, constantly asking the 
Central Bank of Russia for loans. All this is leading not only 
to the devaluation of national currencies, but also to a fall in 
the ruble rate. 
  A single CIS interstate bank and a monetary unit common to 
the Commonwealth countries will promote the rapid restoration of 
economic ties within the CIS, the economic improvement of the 
countries of this union, and the further process of their 
integration, the premier believes.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 5 ITAR-TASS -- Russia's national 
newspapers today lead with reports about the agreement on 
Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho signed in Cairo on 
Wednesday by Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA comments: "This agreement is the first 
and most significant step along the path of implementation of 
the Washington declaration of principles". The newspaper quotes 
Yasir 'Arafat as saying this event signifies peace not only for 
Israel and not only for the entire Arab world, but for mankind 
as a whole. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA stressed that "the document signed in Cairo 
yesterday marks the creation of the first-ever Palestinian 
autonomy and opens a new chapter in the settlement of the 
Arab-Israeli chapter. Along with this, the Palestinians in the 
Gaza Strip are vieweing their autonomy with apprehension. Much 
will depend on the ability of the new authorities to improve the 
desperate situation of the local inhabitants, the overwhelming 
majority of whom live in abject poverty". 
  Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, who is 
in 
Cairo in connection with the signing of the agreement on the 
Palestinian autonomy, told the newspaper TRUD that "the 
agreement on Gaza and Jericho is the first major step towards 
durable peace in the region, it marks a historic reconciliation 
between Israel and its Palestinian neighbours, I hope it will 
stimulate progress along other lines of the Middle East 
settlement. The Israeli-Palestinian agreement must be followed 
by its practical implementation. This will be a stage no less 
important than the negotiations". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA said in its comment on the signing: 
"Both Rabin and 'Arafat are in a hurry to sign peace today, not 
tomorrow. If they failed to do so, the right-wingers would 
certainly come to power at the next elections in Israel, and 
their understanding of the word "peace" is quite different. 
'Arafat's political career is also at stake -- should his 
policy fail, the irreplaceable PLO leader would be replaced by 
his irreconcilable opponents". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA noted in this respect that "literally a 
few hours before the signing, Tel Aviv raised, without any 
preliminary notice, 25 new disputable questions. But 
nonetheless 'Arafat and Rabin, unshakable in their desire for 
peace, sealed the historic document with the signatures by their 
own hands". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Yabloko 
[Yavlinskiy Bloc] leader Grigory Yavlinskiy. Asked why his 
faction was against the political amnesty, which set President 
Yeltsin's arch-rivals free, Yavlinskiy said: "We voted against 
because we thought it most important to set up a commission for 
the investigation for the tragic events of October 3 and 4. It 
would have inevitably made clear that both sides were to blame 
for the bloodshed. But the right-wingers and left-wingers 
agreed on a compromise which set them free from moral 
condemnation and juridical liability. I am convinced that the 
question remains. Life itself will put it on our agenda". 
  PRAVDA also takes up the subject placing a statement by 
General Valentin Varennikov on its front page who objects 
against the application of the political amnesty to himself. 
Varennikov writes "I have no objections to the State Duma 
decision on amnesty. But I repeat yet again that throughout all 
stages of the preliminary investigation and during the court 
trial I never acknowledged and do not acknowledge now the 
accusations against myself. I declared and declare myself again 
not guilty." 
  Valentin Varennikov said he had appealed to the military 
collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation to 
institute criminal proceedings against the people guilty of the 
break-up of the Soviet Union. The text of his letter of appeal 
is also printed in the newspaper SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA. The same 
newspaper publishes reports about marches and rallies on May 
first. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an interview between the 
newspaper's editor in chief and the chief of the presidential 
apparatus, Federal Minister Vladimir Kvasov, who comments on 
lobbying government decisions. "This country has yet to create 
the institute of lobbyism. And I am sure that it will be 
created. Such institutes exist in all market economies". 
  Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin reports in ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI about the results of the Russian delegation's 
participation in the recent session of the leading bodies of the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as the 
conference of the finance ministers and central bank governors 
of the Group of Seven countries. Aleksandr Shokhin expressed 
satisfaction with the results of encounters in Washington, he 
noted among other things that "an agreement on a 70 million 
dollar loan to Russia was signed with the World Bank to develop 
the employment and social insurance services".

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 4 TASS -- The Headquarters for 
Coordination of Military Cooperation of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) intends to propose the NATO to make 
additions to the "Partnership for Peace" program. Specifically, 
these additions will concern the interaction between the NATO 
and the Commonwealth at the level of two defense alliances. 
Preliminarily this proposal will be considered by the Council 
of Defense Ministers of the Commonwealth, Lieutenant-General 
Leonid Ivashov, secretary of the Council of Defense Ministers of 
the Commonwealth who returned from Brussels on Tuesday, told 
ITAR-TASS today. 
  Representatives of the leadership of the Headquarters for 
Coordination of Military Cooperation of the Commonwealth headed 
by Colonel-General Viktor Samsonov, took part in a meeting of 
the NATO military committee which discussed problems of Bosnia 
and the "Partnership for Peace" program. 
  In the course of the meetings, Leonid Ivashov noted, the 
Russian delegation displayed interest in the development of any 
forms of cooperation and interaction. At the same time the 
Russian delegation expressed concern about the unclear character 
of some directions of the "Partnership for Peace" program which, 
the general believes, do not give full guarantees of security to 
the Commonwealth states. According to Leonid Ivashov, the 
program for cooperation proposed by the NATO resolves only a 
small part of the security problems which are facing Russia, 
specifically its peacemaking mission in hot spots in other 
former Soviet republics. 
  "Taking into account the processes taking place on the 
territory of the former Soviet Union, Russia must rely on the 
Commonwealth," Leonid Ivashov stressed. 
  Touching on the situation in Bosnia the lieutenant-general 
noted that the majority of the participants in the discussion in 
the NATO came to the conclusion that the forcible methods would 
not be able to bring positive results as the air bombing of the 
Serbian positions was taken as backing of one of the warring 
sides. 
  On the whole Leonid Ivashov underlined the usefulness of the 
participation of the delegation of the Headquarters for 
Coordination of Military Cooperation of the Commonwealth states 
in the meeting of the NATO military committee.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev of IZVESTIYA: "Social Accord </F>
Treaty Stabilizes Situation in Russia"] 
  [Text] The calm, peaceful atmosphere in which the May Day 
festivities largely passed off in Moscow and throughout Russia 
provides serious grounds for the conclusion that the Treaty on 
Social Accord signed ahead of the holidays has proven quite an 
effective document, contrary to many forecasts. 
  Essentially before the signing of the treaty Russia was once 
again confronted with a choice: Either switch to resolving all 
political, economic, and class contradictions through talks and 
compromise, or continue the war until victory. Until one side 
had totally annihilated its political opponents. Today it is 
becoming quite clear that what transpired in October of last 
year in Moscow was a sharp skirmish between forces seeking to 
destroy their opponent and forces seeking accord. As we can 
see, those who were victorious in October have used their 
victory not in order to annihilate their opponents but in order 
to achieve accord. 
  The treaty's critics declare that it has been imposed from a 
position of strength, concerns only the elite, and originated in 
the Kremlin, not in the midst of the people's masses. This is 
fundamentally true. But it should not be forgotten that, first, 
it is a matter of the constitutional strength of the president 
and the executive branch, and, second, the political elites that 
took part in signing the treaty reflect precisely the sentiments 
of the people's masses. Scarcely anyone would dispute Russian 
society's desire for peace and accord inside the country. 
  Ultimately what matters is not the form of the treaty. What 
matters is the fact that at long last the idea of a quest for 
dialogue between different political forces has met with broad 
support. Such documents, even if they outwardly appear 
superficial, are entirely capable of changing the face of 
society and helping it to embark firmly on the road of 
democratic development and rid itself once and for all of the 
threat of dictatorship which constantly hangs over it (as 
confirmed by A. Rutskoy's recent statement regarding his 
intention to create a social-patriotic, essentially paramilitary 
party in order to seize power). And the president of Russia, as 
the initiator of the conclusion of the treaty, here played what 
is for him a not altogether common constructive role. 
  At the same time, paradoxical though it may appear, the 
treaty on accord has split the Russian political elite into two 
camps -- signatories and nonsignatories. This is primarily 
testimony to the strict pragmatism of both camps. 
Characteristically, the killing of State Duma Deputy A. 
Aydzerdzis on the eve of the signing of the treaty, contrary to 
many expectations, did not wreck the signing ceremony. 
Incidentally, the same goes for the president's refusal to 
replace the minister of internal affairs. 
  If you analyze the deep-seated essence of the treaty, you 
may 
come to the conclusion that it offers essentially a mechanism 
for the preservation, redistribution, and transfer of power in 
Russia. It is easy to see that the overwhelming majority of 
signatories to the treaty are already part of the power 
structure in one degree or form or another. By the fact of 
their signature they demonstrated that they are ready to waive 
some convictions in order to start cooperation with the 
president and the executive branch without waiting for the next 
elections and that they are prepared to continue this 
cooperation even after 1996. Naturally, they are hoping here to 
increase their share of power. 
  V. Zhirinovskiy's party is acting most frankly here. The 
party leaders declare quite frankly that, unlike V. Zorkin, who 
once wanted to see B. Yeltsin as a Russian De Gaulle or F. 
Roosevelt, they consider the role of a Russian Hindenburg more 
advisable for the president. So they intend to press for the 
appointment of V. Zhirinovskiy to a key government post. So 
that the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader, while 
gaining the statesman's image he needs, can use his ministerial 
post as a springboard to vault into the presidency. However, 
these plans are scarcely destined to be realized so long as the 
LDPR's influence among the president's entourage is negligible. 
  At the same time it looks as though the LDPR leaders are not 
the only ones entertaining such thoughts. And the statement 
made by V. Chernomyrdin in Orenburg that no personnel changes 
are expected in the Russian Government in the immediate future 
should scarcely be regarded as pure chance. 
  For their part the political leaders who firmly refused to 
sign the treaty -- primarily A. Rutskoy and G. Yavlinskiy -- 
quite clearly gambled on a different way of coming to power. 
This strategy is based not on slow integration with the 
authorities (which, incidentally, is simply impossible for them 
both under the present regime), but on instant arrival in power. 
The hope here is presumably that there will be a sharp 
deterioration in the economic situation in the country and, as a 
consequence, that voters will turn against the entire political 
elite implicated in running the state. 
  But, as always happens with such splits, a number of 
political leaders are between the two camps. The most dramatic 
figure in this respect was G. Zyuganov, who came to the Kremlin 
but did not sign the treaty. Thereby demonstrating the utter 
contradictoriness of his position. It looks as though, as an 
experienced politician and a true pragmatist, the CPRF 
[Communist Party of the Russian Federation] leader realizes the 
need to sign the treaty but, being tightly bound by plenum 
decisions, he is forced to comply with party discipline. The 
Agrarian leader M. Lapshin looks much more prosaic against this 
background. He did not come to the Kremlin. The next day he 
took part in a press conference by the "hard-line 
nonsignatories" -- the leaders of the "Accord for Russia" bloc. 
However, in the Duma corridors he immediately disowned his 
neighbors at the press conference and, according to information 
from reliable sources, will soon sign the treaty once he has 
obtained the requisite concessions from the government in the 
agrarian sphere. 
  Overall, analysis of the initial period of operation of the 
treaty on accord makes it possible to conclude that it has 
become yet another powerful stabilizing factor in Russian 
domestic political life. And in principle there are now no 
factors in the country capable of seriously unbalancing the 
situation. The main potential source of destabilization -- the 
question of the president's health -- has apparently lost its 
urgency. Since the conclusion of the treaty the problem of the 
worsening economic situation can now be resolved by civilized 
means, up to and including changes to the government. 
  The problem of crime and corruption presents a serious 
threat 
to stability. The fact that the president has signed a 
directive on checking the "purity of the ranks" of staffers of 
the top state apparatus gives grounds for assuming that the 
state authorities are at last launching a large-scale offensive 
on this "front." Which in turn makes it possible to conclude 
that the signing of the treaty on accord has on the whole led to 
a strengthening of the executive branch and of its collaboration 
with the legislative branch and ultimately to a strengthening of 
the state.

  [Text] The secretariat of the central committee of workers 
of the agro-industrial complex, whose representatives, alongside 
the Federation of the Independent Trade Union and other trade 
unions, are to sign the treaty on civic accord, decided 
Wednesday not to sign the document on May 5, Interfax was told 
by deputy chairman of the trade union's central committee, 
Anatoliy Biryukov. He said that the trade union will not sign 
the treaty until "we see for ourselves its text with the 
farmers' amendment and the protocol of an agreement between the 
trade union and the government." 
  The farmers trade union uniting at present 13 million people 
joined the demands advanced by the Agrarian Party and the 
Agrarian Union to supplement the text of the draft treaty with 
government commitments on the creation of acceptable economic 
conditions for the trade union functioning, as well as to 
conclude an agreement with the government on the main guidelines 
for the agrarian policies for the next two years. 
  The conditions were accepted. However, no corresponding 
documents were received by the central committee except for 
media reports, said Biryukov. 
  The secretariat will consider without delay the documents as 
soon as they come and if they fully correspond to the conditions 
advanced by farmers, will give powers for the trade union leader 
to sign the document.

  [Text] Moscow May 4 TASS -- The second stage of the signing 
of the Social Concord Agreement is to take place in the Kremlin 
on Wednesday. 
  This time signatures will be attached to the document by 
representatives from industrial, banking, and business 
associations. ITAR-TASS was told by Sergey Filatov, head of the 
presidential administration, that more than 200 public 
organisations have expressed their readiness to sign the 
document. 
  The Social Concord Agreement stipulates basic guarantees for 
social stability, the use of conciliation procedures for 
amending the Constitution, a commitment not to initiate 
political campaigns calling for preterm elections, a ban on the 
solution of conflicts by forcible methods. The first stage of 
the signing procedure took place on April 28. Signatures were 
then attached to the document by leaders of the executive and 
legislative branches of power, subjects of the Federation, 
representatives of political, public and religious organisations. 
  According to Sergey Filatov, the Social Concord Agreement 
"has positively influenced the general climate in our society, 
and has clearly revealed the urge of the Russian people for 
peace and tranquility". Filatov is convinced that the Social 
Concord Agreement will allow the nation to avoid political 
upheavals and to create normal conditions for the implementation 
of the economic reforms.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Kishkin article under the "View on the Situation" </F>
rubric: "Path to Accord Is Not Easy, But It Must Be Pursued"] 
  [Text] The Treaty on Social Accord was signed at the 
Kremlin last Thursday. It bears the signatures of the 
president, the government, the chambers of the Federal Assembly, 
a number of parties, trade unions, public movements, and 
religious faiths, and the representatives of the overwhelming 
majority of Russian regions. How should this event be evaluated? 
  Here is the president's opinion: "The treaty will make it 
possible to unite all society around our biggest problems. We 
will resolve them if we are able to counter fragmentation and 
mutual enmity with collaboration based on dialogue." 
  And here we have a diametrically opposed assessment, that of 
Communist leader G. Zyuganov: The treaty "tries to preserve the 
misguided tenedencies which have led to the destabilization of 
society and state" and is an "ultimatum demanding the complete 
capitulation of the opposition." 
  What kind of document is it, then, which can produce such 
diametrically opposed assessments? Perhaps it proclaims 
objectives which do not suit Russian citizens? Let us look at 
what seems to be the most crucial section -- the section on 
overcoming the socioeconomic crisis. Here the government 
pledges in this current year to reduce inflation; to achieve an 
increase in investment activity; to draft a tax blueprint which 
will provide incentives for the development of production; to 
develop the structural reorganization of the economy; to take 
measures to clear budgetary arrears in the payment of wages; to 
pursue a vigorous social policy to achieve stabilization and 
then raise living standards; and to draw up an employment 
program. None of this (if only it were actually realized) would 
seem to be a cause for rejection on the part of citizens. Nor 
are the pledges in the treaty to take measures to consolidate 
the economic, political, and legal area of Russia, to organize a 
single labor market, and ensure citizens' safety. 
  So what is the problem, then? Why did not all those invited 
to sign the treaty do so? They did not sign because to a 
considerable extent they expected from the treaty what it cannot 
provide -- an accord not just on objectives but on ways of 
achieving them. The treaty proceeds from a different premise: 
Let us agree about the priority objectives and then seek the 
ways and means in calm, respectful dialogue rather than mounting 
the barricades and indulging in the mutual recriminations of 
which the country is tired. Such an approach has not suited 
everyone, albeit for different reasons. The Yabloko [Yavlinskiy 
Bloc] faction in the Duma, for example, considered that the 
objectives were formulated in such a general way that there was 
nothing on which to agree. And if the members of the 
faction have not gone to the barricades and nor do they intend 
to, so their signing it would make no sense. 
  It is difficult to argue here: The formulation of the 
objectives in the treaty is indeed very general. But the 
problem is that you will not be able to make them specific while 
those involved in the political process wield clubs and seek to 
bludgeon their opponents. So, like it or not, the treaty signed 
in the Kremlin is no more than a kind of "nonaggression pact." 
Its point is simple: to place common interests above group, 
party, departmental, and regional interests and rule out the use 
of force to resolve problems in society. That is to say, the 
accord is principally about the need for civil peace. 
  The treaty contains a minimum set of essential conditions 
in development of this. The parties to the treaty consider 
that only changes which will further the stabilization of the 
situation in society should be made to the Constitution and that 
the relevant proposals should be prepared via conciliation 
procedures. A pledge is taken not to initiate early elections 
to the federal organs of power. The organizers of rallies and 
demonstrations and the organs of power and law and order at 
local level assume not just legal but moral and political 
liability for ensuring the peaceful nature of such actions. The 
trade unions pledge not to carry out strikes which have no 
direct bearing on questions of wages, working conditions, or job 
retention, while state organs and entrepreneurs pledge to use 
conciliation procedures to settle labor conflicts and to provide 
trade unions with all requisite information. The parties to the 
treaty oppose the creation of any armed formations whatsoever by 
political parties, movements, or public associations. 
  At the moment of signing the treaty it emerged that this set 
of conditions does not suit certain political forces. The 
Communists, who aim to change completely the present 
socioeconomic course and want to be free of all pledges, do not 
agree with it. But let us note that the proposed conditions do 
not bind the opposition and in no way exclude the possibility of 
political struggle, they merely channel it within a civilized 
context in order to reduce tension in society. The call for 
peaceful means of political struggle in no way suits the sundry 
extreme tendencies, which can operate only when a supercharged 
atmosphere prevails in society. Already on May Day V. Anpilov 
was calling at rallies for a general political strike, inflaming 
his hearers with abusive criticism of the government. The 
National Salvation Front, headed by I. Konstantinov, seems in 
general to know no slogan more constructive than "Down with!" 
  But now is the right time to ask another question: How 
should we regard the treaty signed in the Kremlin, what hopes 
should we pin on it? First and foremost, we should not 
overestimate it, and we should not be complacent. If 
forces prepared to use any methods of struggle and ill-disposed 
toward constructive work under the present conditions of reality 
remain outside the treaty the danger of violence will loom over 
society one way or another. There will be attempts to exploit 
difficulties and stir up the mass of poverty-stricken people 
to... And yet the act of signing a treaty is, as a rule, as S. 
Shakhray correctly observed, "not the ceremonial outcome of the 
achievement of accord but the start of a long and complex search 
for it." From this standpoint, one has to agree with A. Sobchak 
when he stated that the actual fact of signing the treaty is 
more important than its text, as it shows society's desire for 
accord. And it is precisely that desire, expressed in such an 
authoritative form, which is to serve as the stabilizing factor. 
Otherwise we will not be able to overcome the crisis. In a 
situation where no single political force can impose its will on 
another, there is simply no alternative to accord because, let 
us repeat the words uttered in the Kremlin, "a fruitless, 
exhausting struggle will allow no one to work and will prevent 
even a single problem being solved."

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1625 GMT on 4 May carries the "Details" program 
hosted by Nikolay Svanidze. Svanidze is speaking to Viktor 
Vasilyevich Ilyushin, President Yeltsin's adviser, on the work 
of the Presidential Council -- the president's personal think 
tank. 
  Ilyushin says experts for the Presidential Council are 
normally recruited on an ad hoc basis, usually to give expert 
advice on a specific problem. They are drawn from a wide range 
of specialists who are well-known in their field of expertise 
and are politically loyal to the president. 
  [Ilyushin] "It is assumed that even when the experts invited 
to discuss a certain issue have opposite points of view on a 
given subject, they are not in opposition to the president 
himself. For example, you remember there was a well-known expert 
on Yevgeniy Kiselev's `Itogi' program -- Yuriy Baturin. There 
was also Georgiy Satarov. Both of them are now the president's 
aides." 
  Ilyushin says the Presidential Council does not meet on a 
regular basis. "At the beginning, the question of regular 
meetings was raised by members of the Presidential Council. We 
tried to do this, but after a while, arrived at the conclusion 
that this is an outmoded way to work. We should meet only when 
the president needs our advice. One knows Boris Nikolayevich 
[Yeltsin]: If he has already decided something, it will be 
difficult to make him change his mind, although not always 
impossible." 
  Asked why it is so difficult for Russian journalists to get 
an exclusive interview with Yeltsin, whereas several were 
recently given to foreign media, Ilyushin says perhaps this has 
something to do with the president's personal preferences. 
Yeltsin does often answers journalists' questions nevertheless, 
and the recent interviews with foreign agencies were connected 
with the publication of Yeltsin's latest book. 
  Svanidze rounds up the program by saying that due to the 
nature of his work, Viktor Ilyushin is a man who knows a lot and 
says very little and this is why he has been working with and 
has enjoyed the confidence of the president for such a long time.

  [Text] Groznyy, 5 May -- "Rumors regarding Ruslan 
Khasbulatov's political activities are very much exaggerated." 
That is how Ruslan Khasbulatov's close relative, who wishes to 
remain anonymous, commented on a rumor in the press alleging 
that the former chairman of the Russian parliament has virtually 
headed the opposition in Chechnya. In a conversation with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent, he admitted that Ruslan Khasbulatov has 
frequent meetings with his compatriots, but "these meetings are 
always held at the request of the residents themselves and they 
practically do not touch on Chechnya's domestic political 
problems." 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent did not succeed in meeting Ruslan 
Khasbulatov himself. The former chairman avoids journalists or 
answers with one and the same phrase: "I have come to Groznyy to 
meet relatives and have a rest." 
  According to information from Ruslan Khasbulatov's immediate 
entourage, he is preparing to resume not his political but his 
scientific activities.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Vyzhutovich article: "Central Electoral Commission </F>
Turning Into Political Department. This Is the Opinion of 
Experts With Whom Commission Chairman Nikolay Ryabov Resolutely 
Disagrees"] 
  [Text] The Experts: "The Elections to the Federal 
Assembly Were Falsified" 
  Having analyzed the official data of the Central Electoral 
Commission [CEC] and a number of district electoral commissions 
in accordance with its own statistical methods, a special expert 
group to study the results of elections and referendums under 
the President's Administration reached this conclusion: The 
elections to the Federal Assembly were falsified. 
  In the experts' estimation, approximately 3.5 million votes 
were falsified at the level of precinct commissions, and 
approximately 5.7 million at the level of district commissions. 
  The experts classified the forgeries in three types. 
  "Classic" falsifications at the level of electoral 
precincts: Casting of additional voting papers, administrative 
coercion of voters to vote for a particular candidate or for a 
particular list of candidates. 
  In the opinion of Aleksandr Sobyanin, leader of the expert 
group, the scale of such falsifications amounted to 
approximately 1.8 million voting papers in favor of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation (and against the draft 
Constitution) and approximately 1.7 million for the Agrarian 
Party's candidates (and also against the draft Fundamental Law). 
  Falsifications of a "new type" at the level of district 
electoral commissions and working groups of regional 
administrations: Artificial overstating of the voter turnout, 
ascribing of an additional number of votes to particular 
candidates or lists of candidates. 
  Falsifications of this kind used to be virtually ruled out 
by 
the existence of an intermediate link -- rayon, city, and 
rayon-within-city electoral commissions, whose data were subject 
to mandatory publication in the local press. The abolition of 
this link, recorded in the president's Statute on Elections, 
gave the apparatus of district commissions and local 
administrations the totally unconstrained freedom to "edit" 
reports from the precincts according to their own political 
taste. For example, LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] 
Member Sokolov won in the single-seat District No. 113 in 
Troitsk, Moscow Oblast, where the scientific intelligentsia 
predominates. Instead of Shabad, who was running there for 
"Russia's Choice." In a check initiated by the democratic 
parties' activists, it was discovered that the LDPR and 
"Russia's Choice" had changed places in the final table: 
Somebody had swapped over the lines. Well, they might have 
made a mistake, for this does happen. But similar "slips" with 
target hits were also discovered in five out of six precincts 
checked in Tula Oblast and in Moscow Oblast's Podolskiy, 
Shchelkovskiy, and Orekhovo-Zuyevskiy Districts. Every mistake 
was in favor of the Communists, Agrarians, Zhirinovskiyites.... 
As though living up to their name, the electoral commissions 
made very selective mistakes. 
  The experts believe that the LDPR received up to 6 million 
"extra" votes as a result of write-ups and the transposition of 
columns in the final returns, "Women of Russia" received 
approximately 1 million, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord 
approximately 0.5 million, and "Yabloko" roughly 0.2 million. 
At the same time "Russia's Choice" was approximately 2 million 
votes short as a result of transpositions of columns and the 
categorization of some of the voting papers cast for it as 
invalid. 
  Mistakes and erasures in the summing up of the data 
of district and precinct electoral commissions by the CEC. 
  The experts believe that such things were practised in the 
elections of Duma deputies for the federal district and in the 
vote on the draft Constitution. Otherwise why does the number 
of voters in a particular region in the CEC's final tables 
differ from the district commissions' data? In Krasnodar Kray, 
for example, this discrepancy amounted to 135,000 people. In 
Amur and Penza Oblasts an almost 100-percent voter turnout was 
recorded -- unprecedented even in the times of votes for 
candidates of the "inviolable bloc of Communists and nonparty 
people." At the same time the unprecedented activeness of 
citizens was here combined with their high literacy: There 
proved to be suspiciously few spoiled voting papers. 
  "It need hardly be said," the experts argue, "that universal 
activeness combines with universal literacy only in one instance 
-- if in electoral precincts there is mass casting [dobros] of 
voting papers faultlessly filled out in favor of the desired 
parties and candidates. It is possible to judge which parties 
and candidates were desired by the electoral commissions in 
Penza Oblast rayons from the fact that there the LDPR was 
supported by a 30-40-percent majority, while `Russia's Choice' 
received less than 10 percent of the votes, and former 
Prosecutor Ilyukhin, now a member of the Communists' faction and 
chairman of the State Duma Security Committee, who was unknown 
to anyone there, got through in a single-seat district." 
  The experts did not risk saying that all the falsifications 
and forgeries were carried out deliberately. They pointed out 
that a great deal happened here because of unprofessionalism and 
the CEC's arrogant overestimation of its own technical 
potential: "An example of such conduct is provided by the CEC's 
decision itself to sum up the voting results on party lists in 
Russia's 95,000 electoral precincts and by the subsequent muddle 
connected with the huge volume of data being processed and with 
the existence of a large number of returns lost on the way and 
filled out with serious mistakes. The CEC should have at least 
doubled its staff in order to make more precise the data of many 
thousands of precinct returns filled out with mistakes." 
  But the following appears the most sensational discovery by 
Aleksandr Sobyanin and his colleagues: "In all, according to 
our estimates, 49 million of the 106.2 million registered voters 
actually participated in the 12 December vote, or 46.1 percent 
(instead of 58.2 million voters, or 54.8 percent according to 
the official data)." 
  These figures are political dynamite. For, if just 46.1 
percent of the electorate participated in the vote, then 
the Constitution was not adopted. It turns out that 
the reconstructed state edifice has no foundations. The 
activities of the president and the government, of the Duma and 
the Federation Council, the edicts, directives, and decrees 
adopted since December -- all are to be deemed invalid! 
  Even given the present insuperable Russian craving for 
everything absurd, however, people will hardly be found who are 
willing to restore the pre-December status quo. The 
intransigent opposition? It is less inclined than anyone toward 
a revision of the referendum results, which would promise (if 
everything is deemed invalid, the amnesty too) Rutskoy, Anpilov, 
or Konstantinov a festive return to Lefortovo. At least, not 
one electoral bloc and not one political party has yet attempted 
to dispute the CEC's official data. 
  But the experts continue to dispute them. They borrowed 
their research methods from the Italian sociologist Vilfredo 
Pareto. The famous Italian discovered mathematical correlations 
which make it possible to establish natural laws in the 
distribution of the number of residents in cities depending on 
their ordinal number on the list, the number of beasts of prey 
depending on their weight.... By using Pareto's charts with 
regard to voting results, Aleksandr Sobyanin and the Krasnoyarsk 
scientist Vladislav Sukhovolskiy, who helped him, discovered 
glaring deviations from the normal (if the elections were 
conducted honestly) trajectory. 
  Let the specialists judge how correct such research is and 
how convincing the conclusions from it are. It will be useful 
for the reader to familiarize himself also with a different 
viewpoint. The fact that this viewpoint is exclusively 
departmental does not, I believe, reduce the need to expound it 
but, on the contrary, only increases it. 
  CEC Chairman: "There Are No Grounds for Doubting 
the Voting Results" 
  Does the CEC admit the very possibility of a falsification 
of 
the voting results as a consequence of political design or 
because of the incompetence of the commissions' members? 
  "I cannot say that nothing like this happened," CEC Chairman 
Nikolay Ryabov answered me. "In Amur Oblast, for example, the 
electoral commission split up into political groupings. A 
falsication of the returns was recorded there. The case has 
gone to court." 
  "Is this the only court case of this kind?" 
  "No, 19 complaints about the actions of district electoral 
commissions have been examined in courts. Only five of them 
have been satisfied. Six complaints were lodged at the Supreme 
Court against the CEC, but just one has been satisfied. Thus, 
there are no grounds for speaking of large-scale falsifications 
and violations." 
  Nikolay Ryabov also rejected the experts' allegation about 
an 
almost 100-percent turnout at electoral precincts in Amur and 
Penza Oblasts. According to official data, 60 percent of the 
electorate voted in Amur Oblast, and 64.4 percent in Penza 
Oblast. 
  In addition, Ryabov confirmed the high competence of CEC 
apparatus staffers (although they were all evacuated to it from 
the Supreme Soviet apparatus and are not professionals in 
organizing and holding elections). The CEC chairman also swept 
aside the experts' suspicions concerning the extraordinary 
politicization of the new recruits who hold key posts in this 
department (although only quite recently CEC Secretary Ivan 
Galushko was an activist for the "Communists of Russia" faction, 
while Vladimir Okrut, CEC head of personnel, served as chief 
personnel manager in the Supreme Soviet and was one of those 
persons closest to Khasbulatov). 
  "These people left the Supreme Soviet apparatus along with 
me," Ryabov said. He too, incidentally, hastily exchanged the 
post of deputy speaker for that of CEC chairman. "They made 
their choice and left the White House before 4 October. They 
certainly should not be suspected of disloyalty to the 
president, rather the opposite...." 
  Answering a question about whether the experts had been 
carrying out anyone's political order by accusing the CEC of 
falsifications, Ryabov replied: "I do not want to think so. 
They were probably motivated by scientific ardor. They were in 
thrall to their own hypothesis, to prove which they scorned the 
obvious facts." 
<H5>  The "Adventure" and Its Consequences </H5>
  Vasiliy Kazakov knowingly warned of the embarrassment that 
would inevitably result from these sudden, premature elections. 
Having continuously been the long-standing CEC chairman, who 
until the last days of his tenure of the post entrusted the 
counting of votes only to the beads of the office abacus or, in 
case of special emergency, to a calculating machine, he 
resolutely refused to head the new CEC, making a highly terse 
assessment of the short-distance (just two months) electoral 
race: "It is an adventure." 
  The flaws of the present electoral system, which endowed the 
CEC and its local branches with unprecedented authority and 
considerable powers, have a congenital origin. The Statute on 
Elections to the Federal Assembly and the Basic Provisions on 
Elections to Representative Organs of Power did not appear just 
at any time but at the very height of the fall political clash, 
when the president was looking for support wherever he might 
find it. In the regions above all. The reward for this support 
was the right granted to the governors independently to decide 
on the election procedure in the province -- of which they are 
now making inventive use by returning the party and economic 
nomenklatura to power. 
  The parties were also rewarded -- with a reduction in the 
number of signatures needed for a nomination from the 200,000 
proposed by the draft's compilers to 100,000. This was why, 
while not having broad mass support, the contenders in the 
struggle for seats were essentially not political parties but, 
rather, departmental ones -- the State Committee for 
Nationalities Policy (Party of Russian Unity and Accord), the 
agro-industrial complex (Agrarian Party), veterans' 
organizations and the Committee in Defense of Peace ("Dignity 
and Charity").... 
  The logical consequence of this departmental multiparty 
system fostered by the elections was the emergence in the Duma 
of such a faction as, let us say, "New Regional Policy," which 
represents the interests of major raw material producers, and 
other deputies' associations with clearly expressed lobbyist 
leanings. 
  The electoral process -- it has already become continuous, 
like steelmaking -- is now governed by CEC officials. Not by law 
-- in view of its absence. But even the law "On Basic 
Guarantees of the Electoral Rights of Citizens of the Russian 
Federation" was prepared there, deep within the CEC. Its draft, 
which went to the State Duma Legislation Committee, was 
evaluated as follows by Vladimir Tumanov, a member of this 
committee and an authoritative jurist: "It is a draft law not 
on protection for voters' rights but on the electoral 
commissions' protection from voters." 
<H5>  "Ministry of Democracy" </H5>
  Observers associate the CEC's concern at the increase in its 
departmental weight with the figure of its chairman, above all. 
It is possible to guess what kind of department, which merely 
serves the political process rather than determining it, Ryabov 
will now head, after his appreciable stay in the top echelon of 
the Russian nomenklatura. In the Kremlin table of ranks the 
post of CEC chairman takes a back seat, albeit an honorable one. 
Therefore Ryabov will definitely do everything to return to 
real politics. If his ambitions are not satisfied in the very 
near future with an appointment to some influential post, he 
will evidently endeavor to enlarge the scale of his present 
post. But this can only be done by expanding the volume of the 
CEC's functions and powers. 
  Movement in this direction has already become apparent. 
Controlling the procedure, course, and, if the experts are to be 
believed, even the results of elections, having budget finances 
at its disposal, having branches in the province and a very 
experienced and, moreover, evidently not entirely impartial 
apparatus, and receiving prompt and extensive information on the 
electorate's mood and on the movement of the power elites, the 
CEC is gradually acquiring the features of an influential 
political department. We seem to underestimate the potential 
strength of this "ministry of democracy," which is able to bring 
to power any politician it likes through the voting booths.

  [Text] One of the defendants in the trial of members of the 
1991 abortive coup in Moscow, Valentin Varennikov, (formerly, 
deputy Soviet defence minister) has said he did not want the 
amnesty declared by parliament in February to be applied to 
himself. Varennikov has appealed to Russia's High Court for 
further hearings into his own case, his lawyer Dmitriy 
Shteynberg told Interfax. 
  Varennikov reasons that he wants those responsible for 
wrecking of the former Soviet Union to be found out, something 
that can only be done during court hearings, he believes.

  [Text] Moscow, 4 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service has detained officials from the law 
enforcement bodies suspected of corruption. ITAR-TASS has 
learned from well-informed sources that among those detained are 
a senior official of the directorate for administering 
punishments of the Moscow Oblast Main directorate of internal 
affairs, a senior officer of the investigating committee of the 
Russian Interior Ministry, and a Moscow lawyer. 
  Being "kept" by Moscow criminal groupings, by using their 
contacts with corrupt officials from the law enforcement bodies 
and by using bribes in hard currency, they secured the release 
of members of criminal groupings who had committed burglaries, 
robberies, hostage-taking, murders, and other crimes. 
  During the operation, illegal firearms, several hundred 
thousand U.S. dollars, gold, and precious stones were 
confiscated from the suspects. 
  The criminal case involving the individuals is being 
investigated by the Russian General Procuracy.

<F P=106> [Editor-in-Chief Viktor Loshak commentary under the "In the </F>
Country" rubric: "Please, Do Not Hang Up"] 
  [Text] The Russian press received numerous presents on the 
old and new Press Days -- 3 and 5 May. From the presidential 
staff -- journalists were thrown out of the Press House for the 
second time in six months. From the parliament -- the State 
Duma enacted and passed to the Federation Council for approval 
the Law on the Procedure for Coverage of Government Authorities 
by State-Owned Mass Media. This is a document unheard of in the 
democratic world, which, for instance, specifies to the second 
how much time news programs must devote to the titanic work of 
our deputies. 
  The prime minister alone tried to listen to the journalists 
on the eve of the holidays. Viktor Chernomyrdin received 
representatives of the regional press and promised them that a 
new law would be passed. It seems that tax pressure on the 
press may be eased somewhat, if not removed altogether. 
  Evidently, the top authorities develop various relations 
with 
the press. Sometimes it seems that all of us -- newspapers, 
magazines, radio, and television -- are connected with the 
authority by two tubes from a schoolbook of mathematical 
problems. The first one sucks in all our rhetorical or 
non-rhetorical questions, "constructive proposals" and "separate 
observations," journalistic investigations and readers' 
letters... All this is digested somewhere up there, high in 
the clouds, and the second tube gives us -- on extremely rare 
occasions -- the feedback of answers and summaries. The farther 
we explore the path of pursuing a new happiness, the more the 
answers have nothing to do with the questions. The newspapers 
have been given a chance to feel themselves promising singers at 
a concert for deaf mutes. 
  "Sirs," NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA cries, "what have you 
done to customs duties? In this country, owing to benefits 
granted by top officials, billions of dollars flow past the 
treasury." 
  Silence. 
  SEGODNYA writes about a first deputy prime minister who has 
on the sly become a shareholder in Russia's greatest tin 
combine. Isn't this why tin export rules have recently been 
eased? Who has pushed this privilege through? 
  Silence. 
  How could the publication of a magazine romanticizing 
mercenaries and advertising the tools of murder -- brass 
knuckles, knives, guns, and automatic rifles -- be allowed in a 
criminal country girdled with wars? -- MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI asked 
the Press Committee. 
  Silence. 
  Why talk about others, if the most influential newspaper, 
IZVESTIYA, has been fighting for many months now a bus turned 
into a canteen, which was placed by someone and at God knows 
whose authorization in front of its building. It seems that it 
was easier for IZVESTIYA to gain the upper hand over Khasbulatov. 
  Of course, what is written in a newspaper or pronounced from 
the television screen will shape the public opinion even without 
answers. When they embark on a journey to authority, however, 
they all pledge to be in a dialogue with society. But a 
traditional dialogue between a consumer and a monopolist has 
always been the same in this country regardless of whether it is 
a political or economic monopoly. "Why is it that our telephone 
communications are so bad?" the consumer asks. "Why is it 
impossible to phone to foreign countries?" "We will double 
telephone tariffs on the first day of the month," the 
Communications Ministry responds. 
  The simple truth that relations with the mass media largely 
shape the public view on authority sometimes seems to be beyond 
the grasp of our state's top officials. Yet another herd of 
bureaucrats replaces journalists at the House of the Russian 
Press. Children were the first to give up -- GLAGOL, a 
newspaper independent of adults, has closed. With an openness 
typical of their age, the teenagers wrote at parting: "After 
the authority touched the Russian Press House for the first 
time, we splashed the front-page heading `The USSR -- a Country 
of Assholes.' After it did it a second time, the authority 
appeared to me as a self-satisfied pig that has reached a trough 
and imagined itself to be the most clever and powerful." 
  The newspaper that has been thrown out has already received 
an offer of assistance. From the president? No, from a 
candidate for president, Zhirinovskiy, and his party. This is 
how allies can be lost and how they can be found. 
  As a matter of fact, Yeltsin has once again lost to 
Chernomyrdin in a monthly popularity rating, an event that, by a 
strange happenstance, took place exactly when the former threw 
journalists out of their house and the latter met with newsmen. 
  There is no denying that any authority tries to domesticate 
the press. As a rule, it is those who communicate with the 
voters and taxpayers constantly and as openly as possible that 
manage to achieve this objective. Here, too, our situation is 
unique: the country sees newspaper publications going 
unanswered whereas at the same time at the political backyard 
the authorities are feeding the press from hand with bits of the 
budget pie, large and small. Even now they prefer not to make 
public the amounts of subsidies. Indeed, there is something to 
hide. The circle is going to be closed: the authority will 
hide from the newspapers its stance on their publications, and 
the newspapers will keep silent about who has taken how much 
from the authority. 
  In a word, please, do not hang up.

  [Text] Today at 12:00 pm the fourth reactor of the Kolskiy 
Nuclear Power Station was closed down due to a technical fault 
in the security system. Currently, the energy block is 
functioning at one percent of capacity. However, the fourth 
block can be repaired only after the third one, which stopped at 
the end of 1993, renews its work. The first and the second 
blocks were temporarily closed down about four months ago. 
  A working commission has been set up on the Kolskiy Nuclear 
Power Station. It is expected to give an expert evaluation of 
the condition of the reactor which is out of order, an Interfax 
correspondent learned.

  [Text] Moscow May 4 ITAR-TASS -- Experts from the Russian 
Machine-Building Committee proposed a programme to overcome the 
non- payment crisis in the domestic industry. After a working 
group, including representatives from the economy and finance 
ministries, the Central Bank and other organisations, considers 
the programme, it will be submitted to the government. 
  The programme's main provisions include state regulation of 
credit emission, control over cash and non-cash circulation, 
writing off enterprises' mutual debts, and determining 
enterprises' financial needs. 
  The experts believe that the non-payment problem can not be 
settled without anti-inflation measures, that is state 
regulation of prices for raw materials, fuel, transport services 
and foodstuffs. The experts welcome even caps on prices and 
wages.

  [Text] Representatives of the defense-related plants which 
are on a standby for a strike after two days of picketing of the 
Government House in Moscow at the end of April are pressing for 
a meeting with First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets, Aleksandr 
Ilyin of the industrial trade unions told Interfax. 
  In his words, First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin 
in a telephone conversation with union leader Sergey Shuklin had 
said that a solution to the industry's problems rested with the 
Prime Minister or his First Deputy. 
  Defense industry workers are pressing the government for 
clearing its debt of more than 170 billion rubles and resolving 
the problem of non-payments as well as pressing for tax cuts. 
  Ilyin said that most of the industry's workforce had to go 
on 
forced leave from May 1. He spoke of stoppages being announced 
until May 11 at nine of ten plants in the Vladimir Region and 
seven out of eight plants in Nizhnyy Novgorod Region. Similar 
plants in Chapayevsk (Samara region) will not resume work until 
May 15.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Dubovskiy of the Russian Academy of </F>
Sciences Institute of Systemic Analysis: "State Ensnared by 
Post-Shock Inflation" -- from the FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA section] 
  [Text] The government intends to lower the rate of price 
increases from 20-25 percent per month to 8-9 percent per month 
by the end of the year. Erstwhile ministers now in opposition 
are casting doubt over the realism of these intentions. What, 
then, are the real opportunities and reserves for cutting 
inflation? 
  The January 1992 price leap not only brought the economic 
system to the point of equilibrium between supply and demand 
but, at the same time as destroying the population's savings, it 
destroyed enterprises' circulating capital. The tax base 
narrowed as the economy went into decline, and tax receipts 
declined. At the same time, the government switched part of the 
state's traditional revenue away from the banking system and 
foreign trade into private structures -- commercial banks and 
export-import firms. 
  After losing tax receipts and giving up revenue, the state 
encountered an excess of expenditure over revenue, in other 
words a state budget deficit which had to be covered with the 
help of emissions. Owing to a lack of circulating capital, 
enterprises could not pay each other for supplies, and thus 
mutual offsetting of non-payments had to be implemented and 
compensatory credits issued. This also required the issue of 
additional means of payment. 
  Following the organization of the ruble zone, over a dozen 
central banks began to compete in issuing completely unsecured 
monies. Thus began the post-shock inflation which has persisted 
for over two years. Why has it proved so stubborn? 
  The fact is that the amount of money in circulation and 
prices are rising faster than enterprises' circulating capital, 
for which reason the slump in production is continuing at a rate 
of 18-20 percent per year. Accordingly, actual tax receipts 
into the budget are falling, and the budget deficit is again 
making it necessary to print "superfluous" money. The economy 
has fallen into the trap of stubborn post-shock inflation and 
decline. 
  Calculations indicate that the complete abolition of 
compensatory credits will cut inflation to 10 percent per month, 
but this will prompt a wholesale slump in production of over 30 
percent a year. And if enterprises are compensated in full for 
inflation, then the economic slump will halt, but rates of 
inflation will rise to 50 percent per month. 
  It is impossible to stay in such a position for long, 
insofar 
as the tactics of taking the middle course merely postpone the 
moment of the onset of an uncontrollable economic slump. 
  One such method is based on the use of an abnormally large 
foreign trade surplus -- that is, the excess of Russia's exports 
over its imports. In 1992, this surplus comprised roughly 
one-third of GDP, while in 1993 it was approximately one-fourth. 
  This enormous, nonreturnable export of Russia's resources 
derives from two streams -- aid donated to former USSR republics 
and the flight of foreign capital to foreign commercial banks. 
It is essential to find acceptable methods for halting these 
streams, which are bleeding the country of material resources, 
and the Central Bank of inflationary streams of money. 
  In the second half of 1993, a portion of the steps in this 
direction had already been taken. The ruble zone was 
demolished; donated aid to the republics had stopped in part; 
and a modicum of control, albeit weak but control nevertheless, 
had been introduced over currency exporters. This allowed the 
country to stay afloat despite the unprecedented economic slump. 
However, the flight of capital continues pretty much at the 
former level. And tax reforms, which could close the way to 
outward-bound streams and remove the pressure from commodity 
producers, is slowing down. 
  Unless the chance given to Viktor Chernomyrdin's government 
is exploited, then like it or not the country will be left with 
just one more option -- to introduce an economic state of 
emergency, to freeze wages and prices, and to return for a while 
to state regulation -- in other words to go back to where it was 
in December 1991, only this time with a semi-destroyed economy.

<F P=106> [From the "Military Courier"" program: Video report by </F>
Viktor Tkachenko, Gennadiy Makarychev, and Nikolay Zhukov, 
identified by caption] 
  [Text] [Tkachenko over aerial view of truck-mounted SS-25 
missiles on the move] The Strategic Missile Forces are Russia's 
main deterrent. In accordance with Army reform, they will be 
allowed to comprise only 1,300 lauchers, all with single 
warheads, by the year 2005. At present fourth-generation 
strategic missiles are used for alert duty in the Russian Army. 
Will there be fifth-generation missiles? What will the missile 
of the 21st century be like? 
  Our country's military scientists have carried out a study 
of 
possible scenarios of strategic nuclear forces' operations and 
came to the conclusion that the missile of the 21st century will 
be the RS-12M Topol ballistic missile, or SS-25 as it is known 
in the West. It is produced in Votkinsk [Udmurtia]. The 
autonomous launcher weighs 80 tonnes, the weight of the nose 
section is one tonne. The Topol has been used for alert duty 
since 1985. 
  [Yu. Fedin, commander of autonomous launch installation, 
identified by caption, against the backdrop of an SS-25 missile] 
Tests of this hardware have been carried out. I have been 
involved in testing this hardware since 1983. It is very, very 
reliable. 
  [Krondo] Since 1984 600 combat training launches have been 
carried out at the Plesetsk test range. In recent years tests 
have become much more infrequent in the absence of funds. 
  [A. Polukhin, deputy commander of the division's duty 
forces, 
identified by caption] It hurts, of course. Elsewhere people 
are working flat out, so to speak, and they are being fully 
funded. Meanwhile we have been put on starvation rations. There 
is no doubt about it, it hurts. 
  [Krondo] How will this reflect on Russia's combat readiness? 
  [Polukhin] Very badly, there is no other way. 
  [Krondo] Since Russia and its allies in the CIS have always 
had and always will have their own regional and global interests 
to look after, only the nuclear missile status can ensure the 
Russian Federation equitable participation in the solution of 
worldwide and regional problems. [video shows SS-25 missiles

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 0800 GMT on 5 May broadcasts a 
1-minute report by correspondent Aleksey Deryabin on a new 
orbital space station. Deryabin begins his report by noting that 
a group of scientists from the central specialized design center 
and from the Progress works in Samara have been awarded Russian 
state prizes for creating a unique space station which, he says, 
is a state secret. "The new satellite is a state secret and we 
are unable to show you even a mock-up of it. Let us just say," 
he goes on, "that the wide-angle photographic equipment 
installed on board makes it possible to carry out observations 
of the Earth's surface with maximal precision. Designers joke 
that they will even be able to spot a matchbox," Deryabin says, 
adding that 150 discoveries and inventions were registered in 
the course of the design work. 
  Deryabin then interviews V.M. Saygak, deputy chief designer 
of the central specialized design center, who says that the 
Russian Space Agency has now instructed the center to "conclude 
a contract to make use of this complex facility to serve the 
needs of the national economy." 
  Deryabin concludes his report by saying that the facility is 
capable of cultivating crystals of especial purity while in 
orbit. The crystals could then be regularly delivered to Earth 
without any intervention by man. The video shows the design 
center and mockups of some equipment.

<F P=106> [From the "Military Courier" program: Video report by Igor </F>
Krondo and Gennadiy Makarychev, identified by caption, from 
Zapad-94 Air Force exercises] 
  [Text] [Krondo over video of screen reading "Zapad" 
Information System and military control room] In accordance 
with the plan for operational training, Zapad-94 [West-94] 
command and staff exercises have been held in the Russian Air 
Force. During the exercises Air Force command and control, the 
formation of Air Force groupings in areas under threat, and 
combat operations to thwart an enemy invasion by air were 
rehearsed. 
  In addition to staff command and control organs, combat 
aircraft were also involved in the exercises. Long-range Tu-22 
MZ [as heard] carried out combat training launches of cruise 
missiles against ground targets. Both crews gained excellent 
ratings. [video shows taxiing aircraft, pilot in cockpit] 
  At the same time, Tu-95 MS strategic bombers, after aerial 
refueling [video shows aircraft refueling], flew to the naval 
range and carried out a strike against an aircraft carrier and 
escort ships of the nominal enemy. 
  The Tu-160 carried out tactical launches of missiles. 
  Su-27 fighter-interceptors provided air cover for the bomber 
aircraft. Su-24 and Su-25 frontal bombers delivered strikes 
against the air defense facilities, airfields, and reserves of 
the nominal enemy. MiG-29 fighters provided air cover for our 
troops and ground facilities. Essentially, these exercises were 
the culmination of the winter training period. They have shown 
that, despite everything, the Air Force is in a state of 
constant combat readiness and capable of implementing the tasks 
for which it is designated. [video shows control room, maps,

<F P=106> [Interview with Aviation Colonel General Petr Stepanovich </F>
Deynekin, commander in chief of the Air Force, by Gennadiy 
Lisankov; date, place not given: "Aircraft First"] 
  [Text] In our country military airmen are most often 
mentioned in connection with emergencies on land or in the sky? 
But what about the ordinary days? What problems does Russia's 
air force resolve every day? That is the subject of journalist 
Gennadiy Lisankov's talk with Aviation Colonel General Petr 
Stepanovich Deynekin, commander in chief of the Air Force. 
  [Lisankov] What is the most important thing in the Air 
Force's development at the present stage? How is its structure 
being coordinated with Russia's defensive military doctrine? 
  [Deynekin] On the basis of the air force formations 
inherited from the former Union an essentially new, highly 
maneuverable branch of the armed forces is being created. A 
balanced personnel, the existence of modern aviation equipment 
and arms, the ability effectively to resolve the entire complex 
of tasks in joint or independent operations, minimal expenditure 
on maintenance -- those are just a few of the most important 
criteria for the development of the Russian Air Force. 
  An important avenue of our work is the qualitative 
improvement of the Air Force by reequipping the formations and 
units with new multipurpose complexes with high-precision 
all-weather weapons. 
  [Lisankov] Petr Stepanovich, from which CIS states will 
student pilots be studying in Russian air force schools? How is 
cooperation with NATO countries developing? 
  [Deynekin] Under agreements servicemen from Armenia, 
Belorussia [Belarus], and Kazakhstan are studying at our air 
force higher education establishments. It is planned to admit 
student pilots from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kirghizia 
[Kyrgyzstan]. We are prepared to collaborate in the development 
of national air forces and in other directions. 
  As for cooperation with the NATO countries these questions 
are at the development stage. We are receiving proposals on the 
mutual exchange of aviation specialists for study and industrial 
training. We are studying them attentively and where possible 
we are making contacts. Last year a number of student pilots 
from the Kacha pilots' school underwent training in France while 
French students trained at the Kacha school. The result 
satisfied both sides. 
  Direct context when training air force cadres make it 
possible to understand each other better and to reduce tension 
in resolving military issues. Nor should we forget the material 
advantages, that is the money which will go to develop the air 
force's training and material-technical base and the solution of 
social problems. 
  [Lisankov] Is it true that the Air Force's purchase of 
MiG-29 and Su-27 type aircraft is not planned because of the 
lack of funds? 
  [Deynekin] The Air Force has indeed stopped the purchase of 
aircraft of the Mig-29 and Su-27 type but not because of budget 
restrictions. The reason is simple: The plan to rearm the 
fighter aircraft has been fulfilled. As Russia's economic 
situation stabilizes we plan to increase the pace of the air 
force's reequipping with equipment and arms of a new generation. 
  [Lisankov] What is the fate of the strategic bombers in the 
former union republics, in particular Ukraine and Kazakhstan? 
  [Deynekin] The armed forces of the republics of nearby 
foreign parts lack structures capable of ensuring the safe 
storage of nuclear warheads and the good repair of strategic 
aircraft. As a military specialist I am convinced that apart 
from Russia no armed forces of the CIS countries can ensure the 
good repair of the aircraft component of the strategic nuclear 
forces since that requires very great material expenditure, the 
highest qualifications for the servicing personnel, and aid from 
design bureaus and manufacturing plants. 
  In Kazakhstan there were 40 Tu-95 MS aircraft. In accordance 
with the commitments adopted by Russia as the heir to the Union 
with regard to the strategic forces they were withdrawn to 
Russia. The four last aircraft were withdrawn 19 February. The 
moving of the heavy bombers, as it is customary to call them 
under the treaty, although they are in fact strategic 
missile-carrying aircraft, from the territory of Kazakhstan to 
Russia does not contradict the provision of the START I Treaty 
since it is being carried out within the national territory of 
the former Soviet Union. 
  Aircraft from the air force nuclear forces remained in 
Ukraine: There are 23 Tu-95 MS bombers at the Uzin airfield near 
Kiev and 19 Tu-160 aircraft at the Priluki airfield, Chernigov 
Oblast. Of these 42 strategic aircraft only a few can take off 
because the repair stocks have been exhausted in the Ukrainian 
Air Force line units. 
  Talks are under way with the Ukrainian Government on the 
withdrawal of this grouping of strategic aircraft to Russian 
territory. But so far we are failing to find mutual 
understanding. 
  [Lisankov] Petr Stepanovich, you are a combat pilot. What 
aircraft have you flown in your time in service? 
  [Deynekin] I have flown a Tu-16 and been in command of a 
regiment on these aircraft. The forces were cut back yet again 
-- this was in the early sixties -- and I became a civilian 
pilot. When I returned to the Armed Forces I mastered the 
Tu-22M, the renowned "Backfire," the first supersonic long-range 
combat jet bomber with variable wing geometry. 
  Then I studied at the General Staff Academy and after 
graduating I was commander and instructor pilot of a Tu-95 
strategic combat jet. Later I mastered the Tu-160 strategic jet 
aircraft. In this period I commanded first an air army and then 
strategic aviation. 
  In May 1992 in America I made three flights on the U.S. Air 
Force's Bi-B strategic bomber with in-flight refueling from a 
KC-135 stratotanker. 
  When I was already commander in chief I flew a "Tucano" in 
Brazil and a "Jaguar" in India. The latest Russian aircraft I 
have mastered include the Su-25, Su-27, Mig-29, and Mig-31. 
  Finally I want to take this opportunity to say this. We have 
spoken of military aviation's present but we must not forget the 
glorious past of the Air Force and its history and traditions. 
Without the past there is no future. In the Russian Air Force 
now there are six twice Heroes of the Soviet Union, 15 Heroes of 
the Soviet Union, and three Heroes of the Russian Federation. 
And I bow low to our frontline veterans. The forthcoming 
victory holiday is particularly dear to me -- both as commander 
in chief and as the son of an Air Force office who died in 
1943....

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Bauer, chairman of the Duma </F>
Organizing Committee, by Yuriy Serov: "On 11 May the Duma Will 
Sit in a New Building" -- place, date not given] 
  [Text] [Serov] Vladimir Anatolyevich, what does your 
committee engage in? 
  [Bauer] The Duma is not an industrial enterprise and the 
Duma chairman is not an enterprise director. It is not only 
inconvenient but partly unethical to engage in organizational 
and economic matters. The committee created specially for these 
purposes and consisting of deputies from various factions is 
another matter. It is quite able to assess objectively the 
professionalism of key officials in the State Duma apparatus. 
The committee is working out proposals on standing orders and 
the law on the status of deputies. 
  [Serov] Nonetheless, the media criticize the State Duma: 
Too many of the public funds go to maintain it and the people's 
choices have great appetites.... 
  [Bauer] There is a government decree signed by Chernomyrdin 
a few days ago that says in black and white: To ensure within 
10 days the movement of the State Duma without renovating the 
building. This will allow us to sue those who are distorting the 
truth in print. I think that such articles are inspired by 
people who are not very happy with the fact that the Duma will 
occupy the building at Okhotnyy Ryad, 1. As for perks and 
benefits, whether we want this or not, in mass consciousness the 
State Duma is the legal successor to the former Supreme Soviet. 
The shadow of the former confrontation between the "power 
branches" is falling on the Duma, as it were, with all the 
ensuing consequences: talk about perks, and so forth. State 
Duma deputies have none. Moreover, the conditions in which the 
deputies have to work are humiliating. 
  [Serov] When will the movement take place? 
  [Bauer] On 11 May we are planning to hold a plenary session 
in the new location. The movement will apparently be complete 
by the end of May. 
  [Serov] How long will it take the Duma to readjust? 
  [Bauer] As is known, one relocation is equal to two fires. 
I suppose several months will pass before everything gets back 
to normal. Work efficiency is bound to rise, although the 
building on Okhotnyy Ryad is certainly not the Parliament Center 
or the White House. The compound on Okhotnyy Ryad is a 
ministerial complex built in the thirties. The fact that the 
Duma has acquired a place of its own is an indisputable success 
of parliamentarianism in Russia. 
  [Serov] Many deputies believe that the State Duma apparatus 
is pulling -- and quite successfully -- the blanket of power 
over itself. Has the Duma acquired financial independence? 
  [Bauer] We are still financed from presidential 
administration accounts: We have no account of our own and no 
legal entity status in spending. This surely complicates the 
solution of certain questions. But I think that soon the 
situation will change. As for relations with the apparatus, 
this must be clear: The apparatus exists for the deputies, not 
the deputies for the apparatus. The apparatus and the deputies 
are two parallel worlds, but the danger that the apparatus will 
pull the blanket of power over itself does exist. Our committee 
guards the deputies' interests. We confirm appointments to all 
key posts in the apparatus. Normative documents also pass 
through the committee. We see to it that the deputies' 
interests are not infringed. Our committee seeks to unite the 
efforts of the deputies and the apparatus for the good of the 
common cause. 
  [Serov] What is the committee doing at present in the 
legislative sphere? 
  [Bauer] In addition to what I have already mentioned, it 
participates in working on the budget and the pension law. 
There are lawyers in the committee who are preparing amendments 
to the Criminal Code and the law on corruption. We intend to 
devote the next few months to organizing the State Duma's 
activity and helping accommodate the deputies in a new place. 
  [Serov] How do you see the future of the State Duma? 
  [Bauer] The level of the new deputy corps is relatively 
high. Former deputies were elected to the Supreme Soviet 
primarily riding a tide of populism. As a matter of fact, some 
former deputies too have entered the Duma. However we might 
treat them, this ensures a certain level of continuity. I dare 
say that party affiliation as an element of the Duma's internal 
organization is a factor enhancing the State Duma's 
effectiveness. Yes, sometimes one bill or another may be voted 
down thanks to a consolidated discipline. But if there is an 
agreement at the level of factions, laws tend to be adopted. Let 
us take, for instance, the election of committees and 
commissions. Within half a day the Duma has done what took the 
Supreme Soviet several months to accomplish. The Duma is a 
fairly hard-working body. This may sound paradoxical, but the 
State Duma is more inclined to cooperate with the president and 
the government than the Federation Council. (A different point 
of view is in Vladimir Shumeyko article, ROSSIYA, No. 16 -- Yu. 
S.). Once the consideration of the budget begins, they will 
immediately start lobbying, pursuing their own, utterly 
parochial interests. There is nothing of the kind in the Duma. 
As for my opinion on the document about accord, I think that it 
is the State Duma elected by the people that should be the 
guarantor of its implementation. The president should put up 
with it, come closer to the Duma, and recognize its rights. 
Then laws passing through the State Duma will acquire the 
nature of national accord. At the same time, personally I am 
dissatisfied with the lack of provisions in the document 
specifying the responsibility of the central authorities for 
their adherence or failure to adhere to the principles of 
national accord.

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Once Again We Have No Program </F>
for the Sowing"] 
  [Text] The other day the Federation Council rejected the 
version of the program for agrarian reform in Russia proposed by 
the government. 
  The parliamentary decree recognizes that the government 
decisions and presidential edicts according to which the 
agrarian reform is being carried out "are often contradictory 
and sometimes simply wrong." As a result of the economic policy 
of the last three years "the country's agro-industrial complex 
is in the grip of an extremely grave crisis." 
  The Ministry of Agriculture and the Russian Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences were instructed to carry out additional 
work on the program within one month, placing the emphasis on 
specific protectionist measures for the agro-industrial complex. 
But that will either happen or not. As yet one thing is 
certain: Peasants will not learn before the end of the sowing 
campaign what kind of policy they can expect from their state in 
the fall.

  [Text] "Ordinary people have always and everywhere 
understood me," announced former head of the RF Supreme Soviet 
Ruslan Khasbulatov during his meeting with residents of the 
Chechen village of Alkhan-Kala situated ten kilometers from 
Groznyy. 
  As our Interfax correspondent reports, thousands of citizens 
from nearby villages, elders, leaders of the clergy and local 
councils attended. Amateur artists performed at the meeting. 
  Khasbulatov expressed his recognition for the support both 
to 
the village residents and citizens of Chechnya and Russia. 
  Khasbulatov received a gun and Astrakhan sheep-skin hat, a 
papakha, from the village residents. 
  The day before one of the streets in the village of 
Alkhan-Kala was called Imran, the name of Khasbulatov's father. 
Leaders of the local council explained to our Interfax 
correspondent that from 1934-37 Imran Khasbulatov headed the 
local collective farm. 
  Due to the growth of Khasbulatov's popularity in Chechnya, 
observers do not rule out the possibility that he could head the 
forces in opposition to President Johar Dudayev. In particular, 
the present leaders of the opposition welcomed the return of the 
ex-speaker of the Russian parliament to his homeland as they 
connect their hopes for political changes in the republic with 
his name.

<F P=106> [Report by N. Borovskaya: "Speaker Was Elected on the First </F>
Day"] 
  [Text] The Kaliningrad Oblast Duma began its work on 26 
April. The agenda prepared by the organizing committee included 
16 issues. Naturally, deputies were unable to cope with such a 
number of topics in just one day, all the more so since a 
portion of the first session was devoted to representative 
issues. Members of political parties and civil movements 
welcomed the representative body and expressed their 
expectations toward it. 
  Later, deputies arrived in the suite on 17 Kirov Street -- 
which had been previously allotted to them -- to begin their 
work. Gennadiy Batutin, the oldest deputy of the Duma, was 
elected the chairman of the first session. Deputy Danuta 
Smirnova was elected his deputy. Yuriy Matochkin, head of the 
Kaliningrad Oblast Administration, addressed the Oblast Duma. 
  During the first day, deputies managed to form working 
bodies 
and approve the statute of the first session. The most urgent 
question -- who would become the Duma speaker and deputy speaker 
-- was resolved within five hours. In the course of several 
rounds of voting and numerous consultations, Valeriy 
Nikolayevich Ustyugov, head of the Baltiysk Rayon 
Administration, was elected Duma speaker by a margin of 17 
votes. Yuriy Nikolayevich Semenov was elected deputy speaker 
(13 votes cast in favor, 6 against, and one invalid). 
  We will provide more details on this fascinating story, as 
well as on the entire session that lasted two days, in the 
following issues of our newspaper.

  [Text] The Dagestan Government held a conference today on 
problems of the Dagestan-Azerbaijan border. The conference was 
attended by a delegation which arrived in Makhachkala from 
Moscow, led by Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service. ITAR-TASS reports that the 
conference discussed proposals related to the problem of the 
Lezghi people divided by the border. Specifically, proposals 
were voiced to make it more open by increasing the number of 
checkpoints. 
  At the same time, Sergey Stepashin stressed, the border 
should be strong and reliably protected against weapons, drugs, 
and criminals getting into Russia, as well as against economic 
damage being done to Russia.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Ovcharov reportage: "Volost Resurrected in </F>
Yaroslav Rural Areas"] 
  [Text] Yaroslavl -- The administration of the first Volost 
in today's Russia -- Borovskaya Volost -- which has been 
resurrected within its former, prerevolutionary borders and 
embraces the territories of three former rural administrations 
and one settlement administration in Nekrasovskiy Rayon, has 
begun work in Yaroslavl Oblast. When you hear for the first 
time the word "volost," which is known only from books, doubt 
involuntarily sets in: Why is such a reorganization necessary? 
Is it a just a change of nameplate? A fad? 
<H5>  I Want Very Much To Be an Official </H5>
  In reply to my questions, Nikolay Anikanov, administration 
head in Nekrasovskiy Rayon, where these events are currently 
taking place, and architect of the volost's resurrection in 
rural areas, objected strongly: No, there can be no question of 
any fad. Government by the volost represents a completely 
self-financing self-governing rural territory with its own 
budget and bank account. In the final analysis, it represents a 
reduction in the army of officials in rural areas. 
  Anikanov considers that the system of government in the 
rural 
areas -- whether in the form of rural soviets or the rural 
administration -- has discredited itself once and for all and 
become obsolete. Take note of the fact that in each rural 
administration (and this is usually the territory of a kolkhoz 
or sovkhoz) there are up to 10 officials. The wages of each is 
sometimes five times higher than that of a machine operator or a 
milkmaid. 
  The rural administration's second problem is that it lacks 
its own budget. Its head has no interest at all in collecting 
taxes because he knows: These taxes will just the same leave 
the area and end up in the rayon, oblast, or republic budget, 
and after that it will be necessary to beg for pennies from the 
rayon or oblast, like alms in the church porch, in order to 
repair a well in disrepair or to take firewood for the winter to 
an old lady living on her own. 
<H5>  The Elder Will Judge Your Case </H5>
  We took great pains to break this system and to make the 
territory self-financing for the first time, Anikanov continued. 
That is, it is a question of the authorities having a vital 
interest in the development on their territory of diverse 
industrial and agricultural production facilities from which 
taxes will accumulate in the local budget. 
  But there is also a second issue. That of actually 
implementing local self-government and not just talking about 
it. A law on this has, as we know, been adopted, but it is not 
working as there are no corresponding power structures. This is 
why, having set a course to resurrect volost power, we began 
this process from the bottom and not from the top, electing at 
village assemblies in the rayon elders to represent about 300 
inhabitants each. What is more they have very wide-ranging 
rights. I consider the village elder, Anikanov says, to be at 
one time deputy to the volost head, judge, and land-surveyor who 
can sternly make whomsoever he sees fit answer for disturbing 
the public order, distribute hayfields, and pass judgments on 
squabbling neighbors in his role as justice of the peace. 
  Own Bank Account 
  I came across the first volost head in post-communist Russia 
in the government premises temporarily housed in the former 
Krasnoprofinternovskiy settlement administration building. The 
Russian tricolor is already fluttering above the government 
premises, though there is no new nameplate yet. Aleksey 
Andreyev, 47, is impatiently waiting for a tractor and trailer 
from the rayon which he has been promised and which will plow 
pensioners' truck gardens and transport firewood. Borovskaya 
Volost has already opened an account at the bank. The first 
autonomous budget for this year has been put together and (here 
is an amazing thing) income exceeds expenditure by as much as 50 
million rubles [R]. Now the most important thing is to obtain 
this money as quickly as possible and release it for the 
people's benefit. 
  One other thing about which the volost head is presently 
concerned is cadres. Under conditions of the territory's 
self-financing and self-government, volost administration 
workers should possess completely different professional 
qualities than workers of the abolished rural administrations. 
Incidentally, there are now two new posts in the volost 
government's staff -- that of tax collector and land-tenure 
regulator. At the same time as the compact 15-strong volost 
government staff is being formed, rural administration staffers 
are working out their last days in their former positions. 
These are real people, mostly women, who have children. This 
is a vexed question. But come what may, 10 officials must go. 
In this volost alone R25 million will be saved which will be 
spent entirely on the needs of its population. 
  In the wake of the first Borovskaya Volost, Rayon 
Administration Head Nikolay Anikanov says, all 18 rural and 
settlement administrations in the rayon will be transformed into 
8 volosts by the end of the year (which will make a saving of 
about R200 million by reducing staff). 
  Anikanov does not consider the transition to the volost 
system of governing rural territories to be a panacea. It is 
hardly necessary to redraw the whole map of the country in an 
unthinking and wholesale manner. It is necessary first of all 
to introduce volost government in those places where the 
infrastructure is well developed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Defense Industry Workers' Spring </F>
Break"] 
  [Text] On the eve of May Day the directors of 
Novosibirsk's defense enterprises have written a letter to the 
president of the Russian Federation and the chairmen of the 
Government of the Russian Federation, the Federation Council, 
and the State Duma. 
  Today I.I. Indinok, chief of the administration of 
Novosibirsk Oblast, having brought the message to Moscow, will 
have handed it over to its addressees. 
  The essence of the letter is a cry of despair of the leaders 
of the thousands-strong outfits of the "capital of Siberia," 
where, as we know, the majority of enterprises and also research 
institutions represents the interests of the country's 
military-industrial complex, which have found themselves on the 
brink of ruin and, accordingly, stoppage as a result of the 
policy of market reforms in general and the conversion of 
"defense" in particular chosen by the leadership of Russia. 
  The exorbitant taxes, the artificially inflated price of 
energy and transport services, the general nonpayments, where 
the principal debtor is the state--this typical misfortune of 
product manufacturers of all forms of ownership has proven to be 
a genuine catastrophe for the defense enterprises, where the 
decline in production, in recent months in particular, is 
becoming an irreversible process. 
  "No state in the world has allowed this to happen...," the 
directors exclaim, demanding the adoption of urgent, special 
measures. 
  It is surprising that such a message was born after the 
"Strategy for the Region's Economic Stabilization: Problems and 
Solutions" workshop, which had only just been held in 
Novosibirsk and in which Deputy Prime Minister S.M. Shakhray and 
S.Yu. Glazyev, chairman of the Committee for Economic Policy of 
the State Duma, took part. Whether the workshop "platform" was 
not high enough. Whether the statesmen were of the wrong 
"caliber." Whether at this time our economy together with our 
wooden ruble has fallen several points further.... 
  In any event, Novosibirsk's "defense" will "celebrate" May 
Day until 11 May. 
  What then? Just wait, you defenders of the fatherland, for 
the response.

<F P=106> [Galina Grigorenko report: Russia's Choice Drops Anchor in </F>
Tatarstan"] 
  [Text] An organizational meeting of the Kazan branch 
of the Russia's Choice party was held on Thursday. 
  Affiliates of the most important political organizations of 
the Russian Federation have begun to appear in the provinces 
like mushrooms after a heavy rain, and not two days had elapsed 
since the presentation of the regional branch of the PRES [Party 
of Russian Unity and Accord] in Tatarstan, at which Sergey 
Shakhray was present, before Russia's Choice speedily made its 
presence known. True, Yegor Gaydar himself did not grace the 
gathering of future Kazan party members with his presence. His 
faction was represented by Valentin Mikhaylov. It is he and 
Aleksandr Shtanin, his recent Power of the People Republic of 
Tatarstan Supreme Soviet parliamentary group colleague, who are 
the coordinators for the creation of the regional branch of the 
Russia's Choice party. 
  It was expected that the most radical part of Kazan's 
democratic movement would unite under the aegis of this party. 
But few familiar faces were encountered. The elections to the 
organizing committee were prompt, therefore. The 25 participants 
in the meeting voted unanimously for the nominations of Georgiy 
Semenov, lecturer at the Kazan State University, and Yevgeniy 
Kozhevatov, Oleg Talanov, and Damir Galyautdinova, deputies of 
the city soviet. The last of the above-mentioned had run in 
December on the federal slate of Russia's Choice. It was he who 
became chairman of the Kazan branch of Gaydar's party. 
  The draft program and rules were not discussed at the 
meeting: The contents of the basic party documents have merely 
been noted as yet. Revisions will not, most likely, be made to 
the clauses that deal with the principal goals of Russia's 
Choice. These are, in particular, "political support for and 
protection of the rights, liberties, and safety of the citizens 
and the formation of an effective market economy, civil society, 
and democratic state based on the rule of law." 
  There are already, apparently, branches of the new party in 
all districts of Kazan and in Bugulm, Almetyevsk, Bavly, and 
Arsk. Today their representatives are to meet for a conference 
to form a regional organization of Russia's Choice. Yesterday's 
meeting delegated the emissaries to this party undertaking. The 
self- nominees began their account of their career with the 
words "I was never a member of the CPSU," which evoked the 
audience's great approval. It is not hard, therefore, to 
anticipate who will be a principal opponent of the Tatar branch 
of Russia's Choice also.

<F P=106> [Interview with M.Sh. Shaymiyev, president of Tatarstan, by </F>
A. Leksina on 30 April; place not given: "`The Treaty Could Ease 
the Situation'"] 
  [Text] As reported, M.Sh. Shaymiyev, president of 
Tatarstan, left immediately following completion of the session 
of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan for Moscow to 
take part in the work of the Federation Council and to sign the 
Social Accord Treaty. The president returned to Kazan late in 
the evening of 29 April and the following day granted an 
interview to correspondents of republic newspapers. 
  [Leksina] Mintimer Sharipovich, many different declarations 
have been adopted as of late, but our problems and misfortunes 
remain with us, as before. In signing the Social Accord Treaty 
were you not hoping that it could fundamentally change the 
situation on the difficult path of political and economic 
reforms? 
  [Shaymiyev] No, I was not. Neither this nor any other 
document, however carefully it has been drawn up, should be 
overestimated. But this treaty has a number of clauses whose 
practical embodiment could ease the situation and forestall many 
surprises. It was worth taking part in its signing if only, as 
it says, to ensure that no force be used in the solution of 
problems that arise and that in the already troubled times 
demands for early elections and the creation of various military 
formations not arise. You know my position, I have always 
advocated accord, and I accept no other way. The birth of this 
document, however, was caused by the fact that certain political 
forces have after the adoption of the constitution continued to 
make demands that go beyond the framework of the constitution, 
which, of course, has not contributed to the desired 
stabilization. Accord, however, which I hope will be achieved, 
should help us. 
  [Leksina] But you signed the treaty with amendments.... 
  [Shaymiyev] Yes, there were many criticisms. They were 
cogent 
and presented officially, which is particularly important. After 
all, a conciliation commission, to which it will always be 
possible to appeal, should the need arise, will be formed. I 
insisted in Moscow at the meeting of heads of the republics on 
the removal of a number of provisions which could evoke actions 
the opposite of accord. I note with satisfaction that two-thirds 
of our observations were adopted. 
  The value of the document that was signed lies, further, in 
the fact that it contains many positions concerning the rights 
of the individual and whole peoples. The need for support even 
for small diasporas in their aspiration to knowledge of the 
culture of their people and development of the language is 
emphasized. Any support-- both material and moral--is important 
here. 
  [Leksina] I would like to know whether the Tatar diaspora of 
some region sought support from you specifically. 
  [Shaymiyev] There are many such appeals. Specifically, the 
Samara diaspora had asked that I lend some assistance in the 
organization of a Tatar newspaper and put in a good word, so to 
speak, with the local authorities. I met in Moscow this time 
with K. Titov, head of the administration of Samara Oblast. We 
talked about a newspaper. The Tatar people are greatly attracted 
to their own national culture, however fate has scattered them. 
We are asked frequently not only to send textbooks and books in 
Tatar but also to organize tours by performing artistes. This is 
understandable, such meetings are spiritually enriching to both 
sides. 
  [Leksina] We know that you met in Moscow with Boris 
Nikolayevich Yeltsin. 
  [Shaymiyev] We thought about how to "force" the 
Russian-Tatar 
treaty to function with maximum efficiency and to ensure that a 
variety of bureaucrats not impede us en route to its 
realization. We will set up a commission for coordinated 
supervision, and the progress of fulfillment of the treaty 
obligations will be examined at the highest level several times 
a year. The question of how to strengthen Tatarstan's economic 
independence within the framework of the agreement that has 
already been signed was broached also. It is not so much a 
question of Russia's position here as of the obstacles we are 
creating for ourselves. Although some people continue to blame 
Russia for all the misfortunes. This was seen also during 
discussion of the budget at the last session. Shaymiyev and 
Yeltsin shaking hands is the reason for the deepening of our 
problems, it was said. This is not the case, of course. 
Moreover, had there not been real support on the part of Russia, 
the situation would possibly be considerably worse. Yes, we are 
an industrial republic with giant enterprises. It is good when 
these enterprises are operating continuously. When they are 
standing idle, however, it is a disaster. Those who share it out 
know that we are today receiving from the federal budget for 
current expenditure more than we are paying in. For the spring 
operations alone we obtained a soft loan of R60 billion. This is 
almost 10 times more than our payments. 
  So I stress once again that much will depend on ourselves. 
In 
order to move forward we must have a precise program fine-tuned 
in all respects. And perhaps not one but two or three radical 
economic reform programs. It would be no great misfortune were 
they to differ from one another fundamentally--we would fish out 
what was rational. May these programs unite several groups of 
authors--ours and "outsiders'." The latter should not be 
dismissed, for great experience of the creation of various 
programs has after all been accumulated in the country. It is 
essential to speed up the birth of such a program, there is no 
doubt about this. In the present economic situation, however, we 
are putting the emphasis as yet only on measures of social 
protection. 
  [Leksina] As we know, in the morning you visited Kazan's 
markets. Fairs have been established there now. So, then, have 
our 
granaries not been depleted? 
  [Shaymiyev] No. The markets are well stocked. But it is 
important, in addition, that there be consumer demand, and many 
people's income has, unfortunately, declined. I spoke with very 
many people on this occasion, for hours, about everything. About 
the impending summer season, for example. The summer residents' 
concern is understandable--will the fares on suburban routes be 
reduced, as was the case last year and the year before. There 
will be a 50 percent reduction on the buses. They asked that 
thought be given to those who get to their country cottages by 
river. We will give it some thought. 
  [Leksina] But there are the suburban electric trains.... 
  [Shaymiyev] I had a special talk about these with Boris 
Nikolayevich. It is a general problem. Thus it was decided to 
cover from the federal budget the reduction in fares for the 
summer period on suburban railroad transport. Only on weekends 
and holidays, it is true. 
  [Leksina] You were gone from the republic for more than a 
week. The reports in this time surely carried much that is new 
from the spring fields? 
  [Shaymiyev] The pace of work is, on the whole, higher than 
last year, and no particular surprises are anticipated, I 
believe. It will be more difficult, perhaps, only for the areas 
that had a protracted wet fall. The farms of the southeast of 
the republic. 
  [Leksina] The final question, Mintimer Sharipovich. You were 
taking part in the Federation Council for the first time. What 
was your impression? 
  [Shaymiyev] I believe that it is as yet making inadequate 
use 
of its constitutional possibilities and that this chamber has 
not yet (since December!) formed its own handwriting. Use needs 
to be made of the council's legislative initiative for the 
resolution of major strategic problems. 
  [Leksina] Thank you for the interview. We wish you a good 
rest from the Moscow workload during the May Day holiday.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 85 (575); </F>
compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich's campaign officers 
have succeeded to collect signatures of more than 100,000 voters 
and 150 deputies, which is more than is needed to stand as 
presidential candidate. The Central Electoral Commission [CEC] 
is due to register him as such in the next few days. 
  Kebich is free to choose whether he wants to be nominated by 
parliament or the voters, a CEC source told INTERFAX IF Note: 
Under the election law, a presidential candidate is expected to 
collect 100,000 signatures on the ground or 70 signatures by 
Belarussian deputies to qualify for the race. As many as 19 
candidates seek nomination in a signature collecting campaign 
due to end on May 14. 
  Many of the contenders are about to collect the required 
number of signatures. Among those collecting 70,000 signatures 
are former Speaker Stanislav Shushkevich, Communist Party and 
People's Front Movement leaders Vasiliy Novikov and Zenon 
Pozniak as well as head of the now-abolished anti-corruption 
commission Aleksandr Likhashenko. 
  Critics of the Prime Minister have accused him of usurping 
radio and television ahead of the presidential campaign. 
  Shushkevich's campaign managers issued a statement saying 
"the government's propaganda machine for Kebich's nomination was 
switched on long before the election itself." They said "any 
provision of air time to Kebich's rivals carried the risk of a 
journalist's dismissal" adding that perpetual appearance on 
radio and television by Kebich and his team was unfair. 
  Campaign managers of two other candidates have also accused 
the Prime Minister of using central and local government staff 
in his presidential campaign. 
  In the meantime, President of the National Bank Stanislav 
Bogdankevich told Interfax that all of the heads of NBB branches 
had been warned against financing any of the presidential 
candidates. In this connection, the Bank will also tighten 
control over commercial bank operations, he said. 
  IF Note: Representatives of nine pro-democracy groups and 
movements set up a public supervisory commission to make sure 
that the forthcoming election is free and fair.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rudkowski] </F>
  [Excerpt] The first session of the Economic Council 
established at the office of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet 
chairman was held today. As everybody knows, there has never 
been such a council in the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. Opening 
the session, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Mechyslaw Ivanavich Hryb 
noted that the Supreme Soviet has not paid enough attention to 
economic issues, saying that this has been a sort of negligence. 
  [Begin Hryb recording] The three years of reforms have not 
brought about the desired results. I would rather the contrary: 
The Belarusian economy is currently in a deep crisis. Although 
the strategy of conducting market reforms in Belarus depends, to 
a certain degree, not only on internal, but also external 
factors, responsibility falls on the government as well as the 
Supreme Soviet. Time has shown that the Legislative Branch can 
do nothing but deal with this extremely important problem. 
Legislative acts concerning the economy, which have been 
adopted by the Supreme Soviet, require the most amount of 
independent study. Also needed are broad consultations on these 
problems. We should reexamine the course of socioeconomic 
reforms and the social situation in Belarus. It is vital to find 
a way out of the current situation. Examining and resolving 
current problems should become the main goal of our Economic 
Council. It is essential for the Supreme Soviet to know the 
opinions of highly qualified specialists on prospects for the 
development of our economy. We understand that it is virtually 
impossible to alleviate the predicament without concentrating on 
our intellectual potential. Therefore, it has been decided to 
establish the Economic Council. 
  We have managed...[Hryb pauses] We should also create a more 
operative body which would examine the issues of economic 
development, present to the legislative, and possibly executive 
authorities, specific proposals on ways of resolving economic 
issues, predicting results of various phenomena, etc. Such a 
structure, however, is more adequate for the presidential 
office. Nevertheless, I believe that we cannot, and we do not 
need to do this until the first president deals with this issue. 
We must not waste our time. We have already wasted a lot of it. 
  Our first request to you is to present your opinion on 
existing legislation of the Republic of Belarus, which concerns 
economic issues. [end recording] 
  The Economic Council comprises scientists, economists, and 
managers of industrial enterprises, joint ventures, and joint 
stock companies, as well as firms and banks. Thus, the council 
has united professionals who are supposed to work out a concept 
for overcoming the economic crisis in Belarus. [passage omitted]

  [Text] As BELAPAN has learned, the 1,336th central tank 
reserve base in Chavusy, Mahilyow Oblast, has been liquidated 
four months ahead of a previously established deadline. Around 
1,000 pieces of tank equipment have been transported by 24 
trains to either the Barysaw tank repair plant for dismantlement 
or temporarily to the 969th central tank reserve base in 
Urechcha, Minsk Oblast. 
  Although the Chavusy base was initially scheduled to be 
liquidated by 1 September 1994, the last three temporary-service 
soldiers were released to the Reserves on 30 April.

  [Text] Moldova's Deputy Premier Valentin Kunev regards as 
possible the restoration of financial and economic relations 
between Kishinev [Chisinau] and Tiraspol in their former volume. 
There is every chance for that, he said in an interview with 
INTERFAX on Wednesday. 
  In his opinion, the recent top-level talks between Moldova 
and Transdniestria "have created a political situation that 
makes it possible to do it." He disclosed that Moldova's 
National Bank would unveil its office in Transdniestria shortly, 
and through this body "a system of mutual crediting would be 
devised and put to work." 
  As he put it, "by launching a mechanism of mutual accounts," 
Kishinev and Tiraspol will be able to "resolve the issues that 
have piled up in power engineering, communication, and other 
fields." In his words, "common approaches have been found to 
how the Tiraspol airport should operate." "Moldova, Kunev said, 
is ready to help reopen it the best it can, but only after the 
Tiraspol authorities persuade the 14th Russian Army, controlling 
the military airport, to make it municipal property.

<F P=106> [Report by Karen Topchyan: "A Russian, an American, and a </F>
Persian Were Asked.... Diplomats Express Views on Caucasian 
Topics"] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- The ambassadors of Russia, the United 
States, and Iran accredited to Yerevan have expressed their 
views on events in the Transcaucasus in the parliamentary 
newspaper RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA under the headline "Bermuda 
Triangle or Scope for Accord?" 
  Vladimir Stupishin, leader of Russia's diplomatic mission, 
states: "All the new foreign countries, and not just the 
Transcaucasus, are an area of priority attention for Russia. 
The Transcaucasus as a whole, and Armenia in particular, occupy 
their own historically determined place in the new community 
(CIS), where Russia is not the older brother, let alone the 
imperial center, but is a partner on an equal footing and even 
an ally in military-political questions. All Russia's actions 
and efforts here can only be of a purely peaceful political 
nature." 
  In the opinion of U.S. Ambassador Harry Gilmore, his country 
"upholds the independence and territorial integrity of every 
Caucasian state. In this regard the United States is opposed to 
the influence of any country on another independent country." 
While his Iranian counterpart Ahmad Sobhani considers that "It 
must be borne in mind that the Caucasus should not become a 
platform for launching an attack on others. All countries 
should support the independence of the Caucasus and respect the 
opinion of the peoples of the region." 
  Asked how he perceives the resolution of the ethnic and 
territorial conflicts in the former Union, the Russian 
ambassador replied: "They need to be tackled on the basis of 
the generally accepted principles and norms of international law 
and, as far as possible, through our own means within the 
framework of the CIS mechanism and on a bilateral basis." 
  Russia is ready to assume "a mediating role." Furthermore, 
"practice shows that no one, apart from Russia, is ready today 
to shoulder the peacemaking burden in the area of the former 
USSR." 
  For his part, Ambassador Gilmore considers that 
confrontation 
"must be peacefully resolved by the governments of those states 
on the basis of the criteria adopted by the United Nations and 
the CSCE and international laws." And the opinion of the 
Iranian ambassador in Armenia is that "When disagreements emerge 
it is the actual parties who should first and foremost seek way 
of conciliation. When conflicts deepen, surrounding countries 
are naturally bound to show disquiet. The potential of 
mediators should also be taken into account." 
  The diplomats' answers to a question about Armenia's likely 
foreign policy priorities are very interesting. Vladimir 
Stupishin: "Objectively, historical development has been such 
that Russia and Armenia have many common interests in all 
spheres of life concerning the state and the people, and 
spiritual kinship, common cultural values, and a joint history 
exist between our peoples." Harry Gilmore: "I think that the 
three peoples of the Caucasus form a bridge between Europe and 
Asia. I personally hope that Armenia's gaze will turn in every 
direction." Ahmad Sobhani: "The Caucasus should establish 
constructive relations and seek sources of cooperation 
everywhere."

  [Text] Yerevan, 4 May (SNARK) -- Artavazd Gevorkyan, 
Armenian General Prosecutor, reported today to the Armenian 
temporary Parliamentary commission that presently the 
Prosecutor's Office is investigating seven criminal cases 
connected with the abuse of power by high rank officials. 
  The temporary Parliamentary commission is engaged in control 
of the corresponding inquest group of the Armenian Prosecutor's 
Office. 
  He said the inquest group has revealed "a system of theft 
and 
misappropriation of big money sums, coming to a person through a 
dummy." 
  The General Prosecutor declared that some persons, engaged 
in 
this case, had left Armenia, and it hampers the effective 
investigation. 
  He also reported that the Interior Ministry is intensively 
searching these persons. The General Prosecutor added that over 
1,000 people in Armenia are in a search on suspicion of 
committing various crimes. Mr. Gevorkyan said nobody has 
exerted any pressure on him connected with the cases of power 
abuse.

the Caucasus and support the negotiation process within the CSCE 
Minsk Group framework," said Dehaene. After the talks, Aliyev 
said that Belgium will review the draft for an agreement on 
friendship and cooperation plus a number of other agreements put 
forth by Azerbaijan.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, 4 May -- Today Azerbaijan became the 15th 
country to join the "Partnership for Peace" program proposed by 
NATO countries and states of Eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union. Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, signed the 
program's outline document at the NATO Brussels headquarters 
today. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, Aliyev stressed that his 
country adheres to the principles of democracy and free 
enterprise. Its foreign policy proceeds from the principle of 
interdependence of the present-day world and is based on the 
principles of respect for national independence, sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and nonviolation of borders. 
  At the same time, Aliyev noted, Azerbaijan is experiencing a 
grave economic crisis caused by a collapse of ties with the 
former Soviet republics and the transition to a new economic 
system. The crisis is being aggravated by the armed conflict 
with Armenia. Aliyev stated there is no military solution to the 
conflict and favors stepping up the efforts of international 
organizations, first of all the UNO and the CSCE Minsk group, 
aimed to attain a settlement at the negotiation table. The 
conditions put forward by his country for these talks consist of 
an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of Armenian troops 
from Azerbaijan's occupied territories. The talks should ensure 
Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. It is only after this that 
Baku is prepared to examine the issue of a status of autonomy 
for Nagornyy Karabakh. 
  In signing the document on partnership, Azerbaijan, 
according 
to Aliyev, visualizes for itself two main goals for the 
development of cooperation with NATO: the country's integration 
into Western democracy and its quest for additional ways to 
stabilize the situation in the Caucasus and to end the war 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
  Sergio Balanzino, the NATO deputy secretary general who 
chaired today's session of the NATO Council, noted that regional 
conflicts today are a serious threat to stability and security 
in the zone of Europe and the Atlantic. Within the framework of 
the Council for North Atlantic Cooperation, which includes both 
Azerbaijan and Armenia, the countries of the alliance are making 
efforts to mediate with the purpose of a peaceful settlement to 
the conflict. He welcomed the measures taken in this direction 
by the Minsk CSCE group, stressing that only a solution of this 
kind can bring peace back to the region. Participation in the 
"Partnership for Peace" program will develop in accordance with 
the the tempo and content Azerbaijan itself determines, 
Balanzino noted, expressing the hope that this cooperation would 
contribute to stability and security in Transcaucasia and 
throughout the Euro-Atlantic zone. 
  Also today Geydar Aliyev met the Belgian Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene. He invited the head of the Belgian Government 
to visit Azerbaijan and expressed confidence that a treaty of 
friendship and cooperation between the two countries would be 
signed during his visit to Baku.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Army again intensified its 
aggressive operations along the northeastern border of Armenia 
on the morning of 3 May. The Armenian Defense Ministry press 
service reported that the enemy subjected the border settlements 
and defensive positions in Noyemberyanskiy, Idzhevanskiy, 
Tavushskiy, and Berd rayons to heavy artillery shelling as of 
1800. All types of weapons were used. 
  In an attempt to fulfill a recently planned military 
operation by the Azerbaijani Army command, a large armed group 
in Kazakhskiy Rayon launched an attack at 2100 with the support 
of tanks against Berdavan in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon. The enemy 
achieved some success against our border guards and approached 
the village. However, after 40 minutes, the Armenian Army 
fighters regrouped their forces and threw the enemy back and 
recovered their initial positions. The positional battles 
continued until 2400. Both sides suffered losses. 
  The Azerbaijani formations fiercely shelled Vazashen and 
Diran in Idzhevanskiy Rayon, Aygepar and Paravakar in Tavushskiy 
Rayon, and Vahan in Krasnoselskiy Rayon last night. Casualty 
figures are being determined. Our border guards took 
countermeasures and silenced the enemy at dawn. 
  According to the press service, a relative calm prevailed on 
Armenia's northeastern border during the day today.

  [Text] An Afghan mojahed taken prisoner by the Nagorno 
Karabakh Army has vowed to fight on its side if he was not put 
to death. 
  Bakhtiyar Werballah Baberzayid, 20, told INTERFAX he would 
take the side of Azerbaijan's disputed Armenian-speaking enclave 
because its soldiers were better fighters than Azerbaijanis. He 
also said he knew some of Azerbaijan's military secrets, such as 
its field works system on some sections of the front, mainly in 
the Fizuli sector. He said that, with a platoon of good 
soldiers, he would be able to take a whole district in 
Azerbaijan. 
  Baberzayid, who comes from Mazar-e Sharif, said the 
Azerbaijani Army has a permanent contingent of between 2,000 and 
2,500 Afghan mojahedin. He said that up to 250 of them are 
currently fighting in the Fizuli sector alone, where he 
commanded a detachment of 20. They are based in the town of 
Beilagan, he said. 
  The prisoner said Azerbaijan had promised him and other 
mojahedin a monthly pay of up to 5,000 U.S. dollars. But for 
the first two months, a probation period, each of them had been 
paid 1,000 Azerbaijani manats a month. 
  Baberzayid said mojahedin usually serve in infantry and 
assault forces, since most of them have rich experience in 
mountain warfare and are highly skilled in the use of all types 
of mainly Soviet-made firearms. 
  The Nagorno Karabakh Army, meanwhile, confirmed Azerbaijani 
media reports that there are Lezghins, members of one of the 
smaller Caucasus ethnic groups, in its ranks. The Army staff 
said that up to 20 Lezghin volunteers from northern Azerbaijan 
are today fighting on the Nagorno-Karabakh side and quoted one 
of them as saying, "What is being decided in Nagorno-Karabakh is 
the fate not only of the Armenians but also of the Lezghins, 
Talysh and other national minorities, whose territories were 
forcibly incorporated into Azerbaijan at the behest of Stalin 
and communist authorities."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Qullu Muherremov] </F>
  [Text] The political nature of NATO's program on the 
Partnership for Peace, which has been adopted in accordance with 
the proposal made by the United States, is aimed at neutralizing 
a possible threat of war either in Europe or elsewhere in the 
world after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Meanwhile, 
the recent developments particularly in eastern Europe have 
raised the question of the need to restructure NATO to enable it 
to assume a special role for the establishment of a new security 
system in that continent. In fact, a coordination and 
solidarity council was created within NATO for that purpose in 
1992. However, several political observers believe that it 
failed to fulfill its tasks. 
  Recent incidents, particularly the Bosnia syndrome [previous 
word in English], have forced NATO to consider new parameters in 
its approach on various developments. That is how NATO's 
program on the Partnership for Peace was drawn up. Considering 
the fact that the countries, which have signed that program, 
have undertaken certain commitments, Azerbaijan's participation 
in it will be in our republic's interest. The main commitment 
is that none of the signatory countries must put forward 
territorial claims against the other. Furthermore, they must 
avoid using force and respect the principle of nonviolation of 
borders. According to that program, NATO will hold intensive 
talks with any country that is threatened. That is of real 
significance for Azerbaijan. 
  Another important aspect of that program for Azerbaijan is 
the help our republic can get from NATO in the establishment and 
training of Azerbaijan's Armed Forces. 
  Participating in NATO's program of the Partnership for Peace 
will also bring to light various complex problems in the 
Karabakh dispute. It will be recalled that the CSCE summit in 
Helsinki in May 1992 discussed the possibility of using NATO's 
military forces in ending disputes in the CSCE countries. The 
proposal that was made on the matter was approved. That means 
that our republic's participation in NATO's program of the 
Partnership for Peace is essential if it wishes to safeguard and 
maintain its independence and if it decides to exclude itself 
from the framework of the other countries [CIS] in the future. 
  Two important points should be assessed when that matter is 
considered. The first is the question of whether or not Armenia 
can participate in that program. Political observers are 
convinced that an initiative by Armenia in that regard will 
depend on Russia's stand. That is due to the agreement they 
have signed to become military allies. So, an initiative by 
Armenia will depend on Russia's decision. The second is the 
question of whether or not Azerbaijan's participation in the 
program will create anxiety in the neighboring countries, 
particularly in Azerbaijan's northern and southern neighbors. A 
serious cause for anxiety does not exist. Those countries are 
well aware that Azerbaijan has no claim against them and that 
its participation in the program is related only to its 
intention to maintain its independence.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Sinelnikov: "Abkhazian Cabinet of </F>
Ministers Refuses To Move From Tbilisi"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The Abkhazian Cabinet of Ministers has 
categorically refused to move from Tbilisi to the western 
Georgian city of Zugdidi. 
  The decision to move the government headquarters in exile 
closer to the autonomous formation was adopted by the Georgian 
leadership in mid-April. It was attributed to the fact that the 
majority of refugees are now in western Georgia, and in this 
connection it was recommended to the ministers who are exiled 
from Abkhazia that they should be closer to their people. The 
administrator of Zugdidskiy Rayon has allocated a special 
building for them and created all the necessary working 
conditions. 
  In connection with the refusal by the Abkhazian Cabinet of 
Ministers to leave the capital of Georgia, the Republic's Vice 
Prime Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili, who is organizing this 
measure, has issued a statement. It says that if the Abkhazian 
Government refuses to move today, "it is doubtful whether it 
will move onto the territory of the Abkhazian Autonomous 
Republic in the future." 
  Almost all of the leadership of the autonomous formation is 
currently in Georgia: the Abkhazian Council of Ministers, the 
deputies of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet, Abkhazian prosecutors, 
judges, rayon administrators, the police, and so forth. They 
feel pretty good in their own posts, albeit purely nominal 
posts, but nevertheless responsible ones, and they clearly do 
not want to change anything in their working rhythm. 
  On the other hand, the 150,000 refugees who are in western 
Georgia -- 80,000 of whom live actually in Zugdidi -- have so 
far been managing without a government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dzhaba Ioseliani, head of the Georgian </F>
delegation at the Geneva talks on the settlement of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, by Inga Abgarova and Tinatin 
Gviniashvili; place and date not given: "Maintaining Georgia's 
Territorial Integrity -- This Is the Most Important Thing...."] 
  [Text] [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Batono [Georgian polite form 
of address] Dzhaba, what is your assessment of the talks that 
were recently held in Geneva? Was any progress made? 
  [Ioseliani] I did not see that any particular progress was 
made. There was too much beating around the bush. I would say 
that the Abkhazian side does not hold a specific position. 
However, we presented a number of constructive proposals. The 
demands presented by the Abkhazians are unrealistic and not 
viable. The one thing that can be viewed as a positive result 
is that the Abkhazians have finally become convinced that there 
cannot be a so-called independent Abkhazia. Even the most 
reactionary-minded separatist leaders have finally realized this 
and come to terms with it. They are now dashing about, trying 
to find a way out of the situation and think up some form or 
another so that they can run with the hare and hunt with the 
hounds, as they say. Our aim is to activate the peacekeeping 
forces so that they move into the conflict zone. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Peacekeeping forces from which state 
would be the most welcome for the peacekeeping operation in 
Abkhazia? 
  [Ioseliani] We have several options at our disposal today. 
The United Nations, the CSCE, and so forth have become involved 
in this matter. I believe the ideal option would be to bring in 
Russian peacekeeping troops under UN command. I have in mind 
high command, UN jurisdiction. This option is good for us, good 
for Russia, and good for the whole world. All this is 
realistic, provided that there is no clash of interests between 
the UN and Russian sides. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Can one say that the most important 
thing at the negotiations was the question of the return of the 
refugees? 
  [Ioseliani] All questions were decided on an equal level, as 
should be. As for the question of the status of Abkhazia, all 
is clear on this score. We agree to all the conditions and do 
not intend to restrict the Abkhazians in any way, something 
that, incidentally, we have never done. However, there is one 
condition: Maintaining the territorial integrity of Georgia -- 
this is the most important thing. One should not forget that 
the Georgian people have never been vindictive. Georgia has 
always been famous for its amazing ability to get along with 
people of different nationalities. This is a brilliant quality 
that our people have. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] You will, of course, agree that, in 
today's conditions and specifically regarding the question of 
settlement in Abkhazia, it is very important for Georgia how 
world opinion and, in particular, Russia views us. Nonetheless, 
as we have learned, it is precisely in Russia that there has 
recently developed a negative attitude toward Georgia. Many, in 
particular member of Parliament Tengiz Kitovani [former defense 
minister], explain this as enmity toward the head of state. 
  [Ioseliani] This is not the case. Some people like someone, 
others do not. This is a superficial judgment. Perhaps there 
are those within Kitovani's circle who, being aware of his 
strained relations with the head of state, deliberately state 
things in this way. Such a view can be explained by the fact 
that many shortsighted politicians in Russia blame Shevardnadze 
for destroying the empire. They do not understand that the 
empire could have met with a far more terrible fate. 
  Having returned to the track of normal development, Russia 
has embarked upon the path of democracy. Intelligent people in 
Russia have a fairly good view of Georgia. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] We cannot fail to ask you about your 
brainchild, the "Mkhedrioni" [former legally sanctioned 
paramilitary group that was incorporated into the Rescue Corps]. 
What fate has befallen it? 
  [Ioseliani] The "Mkhedrioni" as such does not exist. There 
is the Rescue Corps, whose members have become assimilated into 
the structures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD]. In my 
view, this should lead to some constructive changes in the work 
of this staid department. Our MVD is the real Soviet Union. It 
reminds me of a prehistoric machine that is useless. Work there 
is conducted according to the old traditional principles. Some 
of our lads were not taken on, having been rejected as 
unsuitable. You see, some people's fathers had in the past been 
put on trial. One can imagine that those who are sitting there 
and taking bribes have more right to work in these structures. 
In short, you should remember that new wine cannot be kept in 
old bottles. These have to be changed. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] As we have learned, members of the 
Rescue Corps are now involved in the exchange of prisoners and 
the bodies of the dead on the Inguri Bridge. Who is controlling 
their activities? 
  [Ioseliani] Yes, our lads who fought in Abkhazia are well in 
control of the situation. Therefore, they were included in the 
Commission for the Exchange of Prisoners that is headed by Paata 
Zakareishvili. I control their activities. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Do you have any information on the 
results, if there are any, of the investigation into the series 
of murders of "Mkhedrioni" members? 
  [Ioseliani] As yet, I know nothing. There exist many 
versions. Although both the security services and MVD and the 
Procurator's Office are dealing with these matters, I do not see 
any results. Some of these murders were carried out in such a 
professional manner that I suspect the involvement of state 
structures or the international mafia in them. However, the 
knot will eventually be unraveled....

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Repin report: "We Will Help As Best We Can"] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, 4 May -- Russian Foreign Minister A. 
Kozyrev, who is in Cairo in connection with the signing of the 
agreement between Israel and the PLO on interim Palestinian 
autonomy, answered a question posed to him by your TRUD 
correspondent about Russia's role in the Israeli-Palestinian 
dialogue and in the Near East peace process as a whole: 
  [Kozyrev] Russia and the United States are the sponsors of 
the peace process in the Near East, and are carrying out the 
role they have assumed through constant and I would even say 
daily contact with each other. 
  The agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho is the first 
major step toward general, stable peace in the region; it 
constitutes a historic reconciliation between Israel and its 
Palestinian neighbors. I hope that it will act as an incentive 
for progress in other areas of the Near East settlement. 
  In this connection it is important to note that both sides' 
leaders -- Chairman 'Arafat and Premier Rabin -- recently 
visited Moscow, which, to my mind, gave them additional 
possibilities for adopting the historic decision and helped them 
to withstand pressure from extremists on both sides and all 
those who do not understand the need for peace. Support from 
Russia, the United States, and Egypt, and our sincere desire to 
promote the peace process on the firm foundation of equal rights 
and fairness are promoting accord between the contracting 
parties. 
  The Israeli-Palestinian agreement should be followed by its 
practical implementation. This is no less important a phase 
than the talks. Russia, the United States, Egypt, the European 
Community, and other countries will be involved, together with 
the Palestinians and the Israelis, in the process of the 
implementation of the agreements reached. I would say that this 
international solidarity will make it possible to move in the 
right direction. In short, if and when the need arises for help 
from us, we will not delay in coming to their assistance in the 
most positive spirit. 
  As for the Russian "Madrid-2" initiative -- that is, our 
proposal to convene a new international conference on the Near 
East -- this idea remains in force. We put it forward (soon 
after the Hebron tragedy -- A.R.) for the purposes of long-term 
strategy. Our initiative was born at a time when enormous 
difficulties had arisen and the peace process had to be saved -- 
and the relevant impetus was required for this. But from the 
very outset it was clear that our immediate aim is to achieve 
agreements on Gaza and Jericho, and then to move forward to the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles (signed by 
Israel and the PLO in September 1993 -- A.R.). And I believe 
that on the path toward peace in the Near East, "Madrid-2" may 
and will be seen as a means of lending new impetuses to the 
peace process in the new conditions, and that this idea will be 
implemented at a suitable moment.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 5 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev has ended his visit to Egypt [passage 
omitted] 
  Before leaving Cairo A. Kozyrev gave an exclusive interview 
to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "The agreement signed yesterday 
[between Israel and the PLO]," he said, "is a good start for the 
next stage of Middle East settlement. Equally strenuous work is 
ahead, that is, implementation of the signed document, which 
will raise many issues, for a new authority means new problems. 
But we will assist in this, too. 
  "We stressed very clearly our vital interest in this region 
which is close to us. Russia therefore will participate in the 
peace process in the future, too. We are already thinking about 
the next steps in further developing the Palestinian-Israeli 
settlement and in other areas. We will pay special attention to 
the Syrian aspect. 
  "Russia intends to develop in every possible way its 
bilateral relations with all the countries in the region, first 
of all with Egypt. Boris Yeltsin's message was received by 
President Mubarak warmly and with understanding. Now, without 
delay, we will start preparing for his forthcoming official 
visit to Moscow. 
  "Also, we will develop relations with Israel. Yesterday 
evening, after the signing, I had a meeting with [Israeli Prime 
Minister] Rabin which was geared toward strengthening our 
contacts established during the Israeli premier's recent visit 
to Moscow."

  [Text] Cairo, 4 May -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed 
serious concern over the unstable situation that still pertains 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and which contains the threat of a 
flare-up of new dangerous hot-beds of conflict. During a 
meeting that took place today in the Egyptian capital, the heads 
of the foreign policy departments of the two countries called on 
the warring sides immediately and totally to implement a 
withdrawal of forces from the established zones around Gorazde 
and to undertake immediate steps to reduce tension and to 
prevent offensive military actions in the region of Brcko. 
  Kozyrev and Christopher also called for the signing, as soon 
as possible, of an agreement on a total cessation of hostilities 
over the whole territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina that would 
envisage the disengagement of military formations, the 
withdrawal of heavy weapons, and the stationing of UN forces 
between them. They called for the immediate renewal of talks 
without preconditions in order to work out a comprehensive 
settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Russia's foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state 
are 
convinced of the necessity for providing a powerful political 
impulse to the process of finding a Bosnian settlement. They 
call for the holding of a meeting at ministerial level with the 
participation of the member countries of the contact group. 
Such a meeting could take place in Geneva on 13 May.

  [Text] Moscow and Washington for the first time showed 
complete agreement on the necessity for an urgent international 
meeting on a settlement in Bosnia. This was announced by 
Kozyrev's Advisor Galina Sidorova when commenting on the meeting 
between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. 
secretary of State Warren Christopher in Cairo today. 
  Sidorova said that they had discussed a possible meeting 
between the foreign ministers of the states involved in the 
settlement of the Bosnian crisis which might take place in 
Geneva in the near future. Sidorova said the terms were still 
being worked upon. For instance, Russia, the USA, three EU 
members -- France, Germany and Great Britain and international 
mediators Torvald Stoltenberg and Lord Owen are expected to 
participate. The final date will be defined during 
consultations between the future participants in the meeting. 
  This meeting will open the way for a summit on a settlement 
in Bosnia with the same countries participating. Kozyrev and 
Christopher were deeply concerned over the situation around the 
Bosnian city of Brcko. The situation in Brcko calls for an 
agreement in order to put an end to all military actions on 
Bosnian territory, Sidorova said.

ITAR- TASS correspondent Georgiy Shelenkov] 
  [Text] Cairo May 5 TASS -- For the first time Russia and 
the United States are unanimous in calling for a quadrilateral 
ministerial conference on the settlement of the Bosnian 
conflict. The conference will bring together representatives of 
the Russian Federation, the United States, the European Union 
and the United Nations to work out a single plan for the 
settlement. 
  It can be surmised that in addition to the two great powers, 
France, Germany and Britain, who are playing a prominent role in 
unblocking the situation, are likely to take part in the talks. 
The meeting will take place in Geneva "literally in the next 
few days", according to a ranking official of the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  The Geneva ministerial forum, according to the official, can 
become a prologue to a summit, involving all interested 
countries, as proposed by Moscow. The idea of a multilateral 
conference is dictated by an understanding that the guarantees 
of any one party cannot lead to the settlement of the conflict 
but can only further exacerbate the problem. 
  The Russian official stressed that the prompt setting in 
motion of a mechanism of multilateral negotiations is 
necessitated by the volatile situation in the area of Brcko. 
Bitter experience has made clear to every one where such 
situations might lead. To achieve a universal end to combat 
activities is now a high priority task, the official said.

<F P=106> [Report by Georgiy Shmelev: "Bosnian Conflict: Is There </F>
Light at the End of the Tunnel?"] 
  [Text] It is very important now to focus attention on 
bringing to an end the process of political settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Without a political settlement the world 
will continue to observe the tragedy, stated Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin in an exclusive interview with 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent on his return from Geneva, where the 
latest meeting of the sides in the Bosnian conflict had taken 
place. He said that with each new unsuccessful round it is 
increasingly difficult to count on the success of the talks on a 
Bosnia settlement. 
  Describing the recent round as "unsuccessful," Vitaliy 
Churkin noted that at the previous meeting in Brussels in 
December last year in his opinion an opportunity of reaching 
agreement was lost: The world community lacked the resolve to 
see the matter through to a logical conclusion. "And that is 
even more so now." The deputy foreign minister believes that 
essentially the participants in the talks are now "going round 
in circles." That is problems which at the previous round of 
talks seemed to be the main, final problems were not mentioned 
at all this time. Some completely different questions arose. 
Thus while then the chief and paramount obstacle to reaching a 
definitive agreement seemed to be questions of the Muslim 
republic's access to the sea and the river Sava, that is 
questions connected with its survival, now these questions have 
not been mentioned at all. New questions have arisen and there 
was the impression that the preceding five or six rounds of 
talks had not happened t all. This situation, V. Churkin said, 
confirms the Russian side's concern that unless it adopts a 
clear position and leads the sides to signing an agreement then 
disputes on various aspects of this agreement could continue "as 
long as you like." 
  What worries me most, Churkin said, is the fact that the 
world community, not to mention the participants in the talks, 
seems to have "lost its bearings," and some kind of confusion 
bordering on panic has arisen. Because nothing is being 
achieved, important but secondary issues are being brought to 
the fore. "I am deeply convinced," he stressed, "that without a 
political settlement the humanitarian problem, however much is 
done with it, will be on the tragic borderline since as long as 
people continue to fight -- when each side will be thinking of 
military victory -- it will not be possible to meet the 
population's humanitarian needs." But what is happening now, 
the deputy minister continued, is that the political aspect of 
the matter is sometimes forgotten and important but nonetheless 
secondary humanitarian problems and even "individual episodes" 
of the overall humanitarian situation are being brought to the 
fore. 
  As for the question of air strikes against Bosnia, V. 
Churkin 
pointed to the relevant UN Security Council resolutions which 
speak of the possibility of such actions "from the viewpoint of 
helping the UN protection forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
helping the world community's humanitarian measures." 
  Speaking of the Russian side's position on this issue it 
cannot be said that Russia opposes any air strikes "a priori," 
he continued. "If a situation suddenly arises when UN troops 
really become the target for a direct attack by any of the 
conflicting side," V. Churkin explained his personal viewpoint, 
"I will recommend (and I am sure a political decision will be 
made) that the measure be supported." Or another case: Perhaps 
a "malevolent action" will be undertaken and some side will not 
allow humanitarian aid through to dying people and in these 
cases, he stressed, the toughest measures could perfectly well 
be taken. 
  But when people speak of air strikes virtually today or 
tomorrow to assist the battalion replacement operation (and the 
changeover is planned for the middle of February [as published] 
and there is an agreement on assisting this changeover in 
Srebrenica) then in V. Churkin's opinion such proposals are 
aimed at diverting attention from the real problems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is hard to imagine, he continued, how it 
is possible to use air strikes to open the airport in Tuzla or 
effect the replacement of the Canadian battalion with a Dutch 
one. It is absolutely clear that if air strikes are be 
delivered in the Srebrenica region there will be no changeover 
-- fighting will begin and there will be no question at all of 
any humanitarian aid. 
  As for the displeasure voiced recently by "some circles and 
people" over Lord Owen's actions in a Bosnian settlement, then 
in V. Churkin's opinion the latter's replacement or resignation 
from the post of cochairman of the international London 
conference on a settlement in the former Yugoslavia would be a 
"serious mistake" right now. Lord Owen, the Russian Federation 
deputy foreign minister said, is the only man who has been 
concerned with settlement issues from the outset and "he has 
concentrated all the threads of the negotiations in his hands" 
and if he were to be replaced now "any of the three sides in 
Bosnia which does not want a settlement could simply exploit 
this fact to continue to fool everyone, to raise ever new 
questions, or return to old ones and so on and so forth." 
  Vitaliy Churkin recalled that in the past Lord Owen adopted 
a 
very tough anti-Serbian stance and called for air strikes 
against individual targets. "When this did not happen calls 
began to be heard for Lord Owen's replacement." The Russian 
Federation deputy foreign minister believes that it is very 
difficult now to find a worthy replacement for Lord Owen and 
that it is simply impossible without losing the pace of the 
negotiations. That would essentially mean, he said, that the 
world community would acknowledge its impotence and "talk would 
then turn to a completely new and large range of political 
efforts with vague chances of success." 
  The next round, Vitaliy Churkin said in conclusion, is 
scheduled for 10 February [as published] in Geneva. This 
meeting has been set more modest tasks. And it will take place 
with a narrower range of participants and the representatives of 
the Bosnian sides will meet to discuss confidence building 
measures. That is it will be a meeting with limited aims.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- A bilateral group of Russian 
and U.S. experts from the Russian and U.S. defence ministries 
met in session in Moscow on May 4. The meeting is being held in 
a constructive and friendly atmosphere, said Russian Deputy 
Chief of Staff Dmitriy Kharchenko today. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS Kharchenko said that the 
sides 
exchanged opinions on problems of European security, the 
situation in Bosnia, Russia's joining the Partnership for Peace 
programme, nuclear weapons in Ukraine and prospects for the 
development of contacts between the armed forces of the two 
countries. General Kharchenko pointed out that the Pentagon 
delegation led by the U.S. defence secretary's aide for issues 
of nuclear security, Ashton Carter, displayed a particular 
interest in cooperation in ensuring nuclear security, the 
reduction and elimination of weapons of mass destruction. 
  The Russian delegation to the talks led by the Russian 
defence minister's aide for military politics, Gennadiy Ivanov, 
informed the American side about the Russian Duma's stance on 
joint Russo-U.S. exercises of peace-keeping forces scheduled to 
be held at a Totsk test site in the Orenburg region in May. 
Pentagon officials believe that it is important to explain to 
Russian lawmakers that similar exercises are scheduled to be 
conducted next time on the American soil. The U.S. point of 
view will be brought to the notice of the Russian military and 
political leadership, Kharchenko said. The meeting between the 
two working groups of the U.S. and Russian defence departments 
continues.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Glebov: "Will The Russian-American </F>
Exercises Take Place?"] 
  [Excerpt] Judging by the latest, very confidential 
information (from President Yeltsin's entourage), the 
Russian-American exercises planned this July for the command 
staffs of the two countries' peacemaking forces will not take 
place. The reasons given vary greatly: From the negative 
stance of certain State Duma deputies to foreign policy reasons 
-- the recent bombardment of Bosnian Serb positions by NATO 
aircraft. The latter reason is clearly the most important, 
after all, what were the Russian and U.S. servicemen intending 
to rehearse at the Totskiy military training area. The joint 
bombing of Serbs? But since the diplomats are not agreed on our 
countries' approaches to peacemaking in Bosnia, the military 
have nothing to coordinate at the exercises. 
  Although, in fact, there was nothing sinister about the 
"deceased" Russian-American exercises: No more than 250 
servicemen were to have participated on either side. Servicemen 
from the 27th Motorized Rifle Division were to have been 
Russia's representatives (the division is registered in that 
capacity at the United Nations and is actually billeted in 
Totsk). The units of the Russian peacemaking forces in the 
Dniester region, North Ossetia, and so on are formed from this 
division's units. The plan was for servicemen from the U.S. 3d 
Infantry Division to represent the U.S. Army at the exercises 
(it is stationed in West Germany and is the backbone of the U.S. 
peacemaking force in Europe). There would not have been any 
armored formations at the exercises since the main purpose of 
them was to elaborate common approaches to the planning and 
conduct of peacemaking actions connected with operations to 
maintain peace in trouble spots. The only military hardware the 
Americans were planning to take to Russia was 50 jeeps and 10 or 
so trucks to transport people and baggage. 
  The actual command staff exercises were intended to be held 
6-14 July 1994 at the Totsk training area, the very place where 
tests of the first Soviet atom bomb were carried out in 1953. 
Do U.S. defenders of the environment know about this? After 
all, the dashing U.S. soldiers nearly marched onto radioactive 
soil. Is it not a danger to their priceless health? I won't 
ask about the danger to Russian servicemen's health -- a futile 
question. But let us get back to our exercises. 
  Apparently, these maneuvers will indeed not take place in 
Russia in the immediate future, despite the fact that the 
Americans had been through all the details of their stay in 
Totsk. The latest visit by the U.S. delegation led by U.S. 
Colonel Deyton Kit [name as transliterated] was 18-22 April 
1994. The Americans were intending to bring everything with 
them (perhaps including drinking water and toilet paper). For 
the hire of barracks and Russian equipment and communications 
facilities the U.S. side was expecting to pay the Russian 
Defense Ministry $2 million! But, alas, we will not be seeing 
any of this money now, it will stay in the United States. 
  In fact, initially the intention was to conduct the joint 
exercises in the United States, but, obviously, the Russian side 
could not find the $2 million to transport baggage and 
personnel. Then the Russian side suggested Duisburg (Germany) as 
the venue for the joint exercises. But the German leadership 
was not enthusiastic about Moscow's initiative, so the 
interested sides decided on Totsk as the venue for the joint 
exercises, since this would cost the Russian side practically 
nothing in hard currency. 
  But, as it happens, the price was a quiet scandal in 
parliament, demands from the stubborn opposition, and, as a 
result, no joint exercises on Russian territory. It is not 
worth the trouble, as they say. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "President Clinton Survived </F>
90-Minute TV Interrogation"] 
  [Text] Viewers of CNN have spent 90 minutes with the U.S. 
President and his foreign policy. Bill Clinton tried to 
convince the viewers that in the world arena "weakness, 
indecisiveness, and a lack of principle" are qualities not 
characteristic of Washington. 
  Not one of the journalists or politicians from the United 
States, Cuba, Poland, South Korea, Israel, or the many other 
countries enabled by CNN to question the president in person was 
able to catch him out. The president was steadfast even though 
his administration's foreign policy did not become any clearer 
after his 90-minute defense of it on live television. 
  Bill Clinton told Lawrence Pezzullo, the U.S. representative 
to Haiti, expelled from the island by the military regime, that 
he has not yet abandoned the idea of using military force to 
restore democracy there. 
  He promised North Korea friendship if Pyongyang agrees to an 
international inspection of its nuclear facilities where, it is 
believed, work is being carried out to create a weapon of mass 
destruction. 
  Clinton is convinced that Beijing has partly rectified the 
human rights situation and would thus like to extend to China 
most-favored-nation status in trade with the United States. But 
the situation is far from perfect. For that reason the 
possibility of depriving China of trade privileges remains in 
existence. 
  South Africa was promised an increase in U.S. aid, on which 
a 
"dream will be built" there [na kotoruyu tam budet "postroyena 
skazka"]. As for Bosnia, the problems there "have proved far 
more difficult than I imagined when I was running for the 
presidency," Clinton said. 
  President Clinton claimed Russia, the Near East, and trade 
problems as the big successes of his foreign policy. But at the 
present time the world is in a state of turmoil and is resisting 
the attempts of the United States, the world's leader and 
guarantor of the universal standards of human rights, to call it 
to order. Furthermore, the absence of a second superpower (the 
Soviet Union) has, on the president's admission, not made 
foreign policy problems any easier.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Shokhin, leader of Russian delegation </F>
at talks with IMF and World Bank in Washington, under the 
"Dangerous Version" rubric: "West's Financial Circles Support 
Russian Course. Meetings in Washington Inspire Feeling of 
Optimism"] 
  [Text] I have already had occasion in Washington to answer 
questions from representatives of the press on the results of 
our delegation's participation in the work of the session of the 
leading organs of the IMF and the World Bank, as well as the 
conference of finance ministers and heads of the central banks 
of G-7 countries which was held at the same time. The results 
of our trip could be briefly reduced to the points listed below. 
  But I would like first of all to explain the reasons for 
Russia's presence at these important international financial 
forums. The lessons of recent years demonstrate that the 
transitional economies' need for bilateral and multilateral 
financial assistance is far more considerable than previously 
thought. That is why close cooperation with the IMF and the use 
of its resources remain critically important not just in the 
short term but also in the medium term. The systemic 
transformations fund created a year ago for the purpose of 
assisting structural reforms has proven its effectiveness in 
this regard. Nevertheless, broader use must be made of the 
IMF's existing instruments. 
  We stated all of that frankly at the session of the Interim 
Committee of the IMF Board of Governors. The foreign debt 
problem, for example, is very topical today for states with a 
transitional economy. In 1993 the easing of the debt burden 
which we inherited from the former Union formed the major part 
of the West's official assistance to Russia. We appreciate our 
creditors' understanding of our temporary difficulties. It will 
take great effort to support Russia's balance of payments both 
this year and in the next few years. Because in these years the 
debt servicing payments are due to reach their peak. We have no 
other option but to ask our creditors for a new rescheduling of 
the debt repayment. 
  Our delegation described the Russian Government's rigorous 
but very realistic program of economic reforms. In our view, 
Russia, in cooperation with the multinational financial 
organizations, will be able to achieve a breakthrough and begin 
moving toward stabilization and economic recovery in 1994. All 
the conditions are in place for this: Inflation has begun to be 
curbed, an extremely realistic draft federal budget has been 
approved, the government intends to adhere resolutely to a 
policy of financial stabilization and systemic transformations 
and not make changes to the currency exchange system, and the 
Central Bank will not undertake any measures to maintain the 
ruble exchange rate artificially. 
  On the basis of all that we raised a whole series of major 
problems of concern to us at the meetings which we attended. 
The essential nature of the agenda lent itself to that: Unlike 
previous years, the discussions which were held were not on the 
question of whether our government intends to continue the 
course of reforms but on the question of building a foundation 
for their implementation and, specifically, of creating 
conditions conducive to attracting foreign investments into 
Russia, introducing a tax regime to aid that process, and 
insuring such capital investments against political risks. 
  At the meeting with the G-7 ministers we raised the 
question of the discriminatory approach against Russia in the 
international markets in aluminum, uranium, and space technology 
among others. We support the creation of a social and legal 
base whereby Russia would be regarded as a country with a 
transitional economy, not as a state with a centralized trading 
system. In that connection we stressed once more the need to 
abolish the Jackson-Vanik amendment insofar as it applies to the 
Russian Federation, an amendment which, as is well known, linked 
the granting to the former USSR of most-favored nation status in 
trade with the United States to the USSR's "conduct" in the 
human rights sphere, above all Jewish emigration. 
  There was another set of questions on reorienting the 
previously announced package support for the Russian reforms to 
projects in the social sphere. Finally we examined problems 
pertaining to Russia's mutual relationship with the creditors of 
the Paris Club. We stated bluntly that this year our potential 
for servicing the foreign debt will be even more limited than it 
was last year. And we found understanding. By all accounts the 
Paris Club and the Russian Government will reach agreement on 
changing the structure of our foreign debt payments by the end 
of May or the start of June. We are looking forward to more 
favorable conditions for settling the debt than the deferral 
granted by the club last year of a payment of $15 billion out of 
the total of $18 billion. 
  We also put forward an initiative on Russia's possible 
membership of the Paris Club as a creditor. The fact is that 
many developing countries owe large amounts to Russia as the 
successor in law to the USSR. Furthermore, in our relations 
with international financial organizations and the G-7, we have 
always stressed that we are not only asking for support for our 
course of reforms but are also acting as a donor toward former 
Soviet republics and are bearing enormous costs as a result. We 
are not insisting on permanent membership of the Paris Club but 
a mechanism for our participation at least as an observer must 
be created. 
  With the representatives of the World Bank we discussed the 
possibility of Russia's obtaining several major credits in the 
coming months for various economic reform programs, including a 
second loan for the modernization of the oil industry ($500 
million), two credits for the reform of the agricultural sector 
($325 million), the modernization of financial institutions 
($200 million), and the reform of entrepreneurial structures 
($200 million). We hope that the World Bank will be able to 
allocate a large part of these credits as early as the end of 
the current financial year (which expires 30 June). The 
agreement to grant a loan for the development of an employment 
and social protection service has already been signed with the 
World Bank: We will receive $70 million from it for that 
purpose. 
  Thus it may be said that Russia's problems and our relations 
with the leading international financial organizations were at 
the center of attention of these meetings. The Russian 
Federation Government's present course found understanding and 
support. For my part I can say that the results of the meetings 
in Washington left us with a sense of satisfaction.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the Russian Federation Foreign Minister `On a </F>
Third Peace Conference'" -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI headline] 
  [Text] The centenary of the First Peace Conference, 
convened on Russia's initiative in The Hague in 1899, is 
approaching. This forum and the subsequent Second Peace 
Conference in 1907 were very important milestones in the world 
community's life, in the establishment of the principles of the 
international rule of law. The conventions, declarations, and 
other decisions adopted at it imparted powerful momentum to the 
creation of a system of peaceful settlement of disputes and 
humanization of the military sphere, and placed the problem of 
arms limitation and disarmament on a practical footing. 
  Although they were unable to prevent the conflagration of 
two 
world wars, the conferences in The Hague were a great beginning, 
determining the main direction of the development of 
international life in the 20th century -- the desire for peace 
and the establishment of the foundations of philanthropy and 
justice. 
  Today, as we approach the third millennium, mankind has no 
right to pass up an opportunity of strengthening international 
peace and asserting the principles of law which, in the 
conditions of the current multipolar world structure, must form 
the basis of a new global equilibrium. Vigorous steps will be 
needed to translate this age-old dream into reality. 
  On behalf of President B.N. Yeltsin and on behalf of Russia 
as chairman of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conferences, the Russian 
Federation foreign minister proposes that all states discuss the 
idea of convening a Third International Peace Conference in 1999. 
  In making this proposal Russia is guided primarily by the 
decisions of the Second Hague Conference in 1907, which 
recommended that the participating states "gather for a third 
Peace Conference." We are expecting interest in this proposal, 
in view of the position of the Nonaligned Movement, the 
decisions of the UN General Assembly, which declared 1990-1999 
the Decade of International Law, and the recommendations in this 
sphere by the 1993 conference of the Permanent Court of 
Arbitration. 
  The preliminary agenda for the third conference might be as 
follows: 
  -- improving the system for settling disputes, including the 
possible amendment or revision of the 1899 and 1907 conventions; 
  -- filling the gaps in international humanitarian law to be 
applied during armed conflicts, and developing it; 
  -- creating a system of international criminal justice in 
respect of crimes against peace and mankind and other 
international offenses. 
  If there is support for these proposals, Russia is prepared 
to submit for examination by the states ideas on the program for 
the forum, as happened during the preparations for the First and 
Second Hague Peace Conferences. For our part, we are amenable 
to a dialogue on the content, organization, and holding of a 
Third Peace Conference. 
  In accordance with the 1907 decisions, it is necessary to 
institute a preparatory committee two years before it opens in 
order to study proposals and to draft documents and also 
recommendations on the organization of its work and the 
procedure to be applied. We are willing to participate actively 
in the establishment and work of this body. 
  Russia favors the formation of a steering committee within 
the framework of the Court of Arbitration Administrative Council 
to prepare proposals connected with revising the 1899 and 1907 
conventions on the peaceful settlement of disputes. The 
Administrative Council's recommendations on the results of the 
steering committee's work could be a significant contribution to 
the preparation of a third conference. 
  Of course, the organizational measures must be implemented 
in 
collaboration with the United Nations, within the framework of 
the Decade of International Law it has proclaimed. 
  As for the venue of the Third Peace Conference, if the Dutch 
Government agrees, then, like the two previous conferences, it 
could be held in The Hague. 
  One hundred years, particularly in the context of the 
dynamic 
20th century, is an enormously long time. Although, leafing 
through old documents relating to the 1899 and 1907 Hague 
Conferences, one never ceases to be amazed that the values laid 
down then have not depreciated over the years. The link between 
the eras is eloquently demonstrated in the 12 August 1898 
Russian Foreign Ministry note on convening the First Hague Peace 
Conference: "...This conference could augur well for the next 
century. It would join in one mighty force the efforts of all 
states that sincerely want the great idea of universal peace to 
triumph over the realm of trouble and strife. At the same time, 
it would seal their agreement through the joint recognition of 
the principles of law and justice on which the security of 
states and prosperity of the peoples are based." 
  How relevant these words are to us now.

  [Text] Russia's natural gas monopoly Gazprom has warned 
several republics and regions of the Russian Federation that it 
would cut off gas supplies to their industrial enterprises due 
to their debts. 
  In telegrams sent to the republics of Karachay-Circassia, 
Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, Bashkiria and 
Daghestan, to Perm, Novosibirsk, Astrakhan, Kemerovo, Rostov and 
Voronezh Regions, and to Stavropol Territory, Gazprom says it 
will suspend its gas deliveries to them between May 4 and 9 and 
demands that they present schedules for the payment of their 
arrears, totaling about three billion rubles, a sum which, 
according to Gazprom sources, is much higher than the overall 
debt for Russian gas of other former Soviet republics, including 
Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. 
  The sources told the Oil Information Agency that Moldova had 
still not presented its own schedule for the repayment of a debt 
which had reached 131 billion rubles by April 1. As of April 
15, Gazprom slashed its supplies to Moldova by one-third. The 
sources said that this year the republic had transferred "not a 
single ruble" to Gazprom's bank account, having paid part of its 
arrears with food exports. The Russian-Moldovan talks on the 
debt problem, originally scheduled for the end of April, have 
been postponed until this Friday, the sources said. 
  In an agreement signed by the two countries' governments 
late 
last year, Moldova pledged to send to Russia 145 million 
dollars' worth of food and consumer goods as payment for part of 
the 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas the republic is due to 
receive from Gazprom this year. 
  Russia today charges Moldova 80 dollars for 1,000 cubic 
meters of gas. Moldova, in turn, charges Russia 1.5 dollars per 
100 kilometers for every 1,000 cubic meters of gas pipelined 
through Moldovan territory to Romania.

  [Text] Tallinn May 5 TASS -- Russia and Estonia are toiling 
over a draft agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
that Baltic republic. According to the leader of the Estonian 
delegation Vaino Reinart, Estonia is ready to sign the agreement 
and "the only obstacle to the signing is Russia's desire to link 
the problem to the provision of social guarantees to the Russian 
Army pensioners residing in the republic". 
  The Russian delegation leader Vasili Svirin met Estonian 
President Lennart Meri on the eve of the today's round of 
negotiations. According to him, the results of their 
conversation provide grounds for the hope that the parties to 
the drawn-out "divorce procedure" between Russia and Estonia 
will be able to muster enough strength and desire to get down to 
the search for compromise solutions. 
  "Russia pursues no military aims or interests in Estonia," 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin declared in the Kremlin on 
Wednesday. He stressed that "Russia intends to withdraw all 
troops from Estonia, but we want this to be done on a legal 
basis, as is being done in relations between Russia and 
Lithuania, Russia and Latvia". If Estonia manifests good-will, 
we for our part will respond with full accord", Yeltsin said. 
  Negotiations behind closed doors will last for two days. 
After the end of this, the nineteenth round of negotiations, 
the heads of the delegations are expected to hold press 
conferences on the results of negotiations.

  [Text] Moscow May 4 TASS -- Ukraine has removed to Russia 
180 strategic nuclear missiles as of today, Igor Sergeyev, 
commander of the Russian strategic missile forces, said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Sergeyev said 
that the missiles will be scrapped at Russian plants as 
envisaged by the agreements signed by Russia, Ukraine and the 
United States and START-1 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. 
  Sergeyev recalled that under the Lisbon Protocol, 
Byelorussia 
[Belarus], Kazakhstan and Ukraine are also parties to the treaty 
which has been ratified by the U.S., Russia, Byelorussia and 
Kazakhstan. 
  He stressed that Russia has already scrapped over 350 
missiles and about 300 missile launchers. He added, however, 
that the implementation of the treaty depends not only on 
Russia, but also other ex-Soviet republics which posses nuclear 
weapons. 
  Russia has signed an agreement with Byelorussia to transfer 
a 
group of strategic missile troops in Byelorussia under Russia's 
control. Russia is also withdrawing strategic missile units 
from that republic. 
  A similar agreement was signed with Kazakhstan in March 
1994. 
Both sides are now working on an agreement on the elimination of 
missile facilities.

<F P=106> [Interview with special envoy Yuriy Dubinin, chief Russian </F>
delegate at negotiations with Ukraine, by Andrey Sharyy in the 
"Diplomatic Paths" column: "Misfire" -- place and date not 
given; first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Excerpts] The main diplomatic path of the day leads us 
from Moscow to Kiev. The talks in Sevastopol on the fate of the 
Black Sea Fleet have ended in scandal. Yet special envoy Yuriy 
Dubinin, head of the Russian delegation at the negotiations with 
Ukraine, whom ROSSIYA's correspondent asked to comment, prefers 
not to dramatize what has happened. 
  [Dubinin] The aim of the negotiations, as is known, was 
defined by the presidents of the two countries in a special 
agreement. Concrete provisions were formulated on which accord 
was to be reached: separate basing of the navies and the 
proportions of sharing out the battleships and vessels. It 
cannot be said that the negotiations in Sevastopol were 
completely without result. Pavel Grachev showed maximum 
flexibility, and as a result parameters bearing on the division 
of Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels were defined. As far as 
navy basing is concerned, however, the actions of the Ukrainian 
delegation, regrettably, fully deviated from the instructions by 
the Ukrainian president. 
  [Sharyy] To what do you attribute this? 
  [Dubinin] Let the Ukrainians straighten this out themselves. 
I would like to confine myself to stating the fact. 
Incidentally, lying in front of me is a report from Kiev about 
a statement made by Kravchuk after the negotiations: "I am for 
a Russian Navy base to be created in Sevastopol in accordance 
with international legal norms." But apparently certain forces 
in Ukraine do not like presidential orders. [passage omitted] 
  [Sharyy] The development of relations between the two 
fraternal peoples is nonetheless proceeding against a rather 
negative backdrop, accompanied by an endless chain of incidents: 
Crimea, the Black Sea Fleet, the gas pipeline, nuclear problems, 
and once again Crimea and the fleet. Maybe Russia should take a 
tougher line? 
  [Dubinin] I do not think that this is the hope that should 
feed us. After all, politicians exist not in a vacuum, but in a 
broad sense their actions are subordinated to the will of the 
people. The more misfires -- as long as we are doomed to have 
them -- the more clearly the public opinion of both countries 
sees the reasons behind the problems, the more clear-cut will be 
their assessment, and the quicker the will of the people will be 
expressed. [passage omitted] 
  [Sharyy] In its time Russia stated the need to prepare and 
sign a public-political treaty with Ukraine that would regulate 
all spheres of bilateral relations. When could such a document 
appear? 
  [Dubinin] We have accumulated a fairly rich material. 
Nearly 80 intergovernment and interdepartmental agreements have 
been signed, which substantially facilitates work on the text of 
the treaty. But such documents are signed only after the field 
of relations between the countries has been cleared. Then law, 
the political will of the people, and actual reality can be 
adjusted to each other. Any, even the most important, document 
is an intermediate stage in these relations, but hardly a point 
of their departure. If everything depended only on Russia we 
would be within arm's reach of the result. But Moscow cannot 
conclude a treaty with itself and naturally we do not posses all 
the information about the sum total of "inputs" on the Ukrainian 
side. 
  [Sharyy] From the professional, diplomatic point of view, 
what are the difficulties in the negotiations with the 
Ukrainians? 
  [Dubinin] First of all, psychological difficulties arise, 
because with a whole number of our current partners we were 
familiar also yesterday, when we worked in almost adjacent 
offices. Some Ukrainian representatives are displaying certain 
peculiarities that are rather unusual in diplomatic practice. 
If they do not like a member of the Russian delegation, they 
seem to be doing everything to remove him: They apparently 
believe that the fate of the talks depends on a particular 
individual, not on the country's position. Sometimes there are 
unnecessary emotional outbursts, as was the case with the 
detention of Pavel Grachev's plane in Sevastopol. What did the 
Ukrainian colleagues want to achieve? After all, Ukraine hardly 
needs two defense ministers. But all of this can be overcome. 
When we begin to work with a common aspiration to achieve a 
goal, we find a common language quickly. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian first deputy </F>
foreign minister, by correspondent Aleksandr Shkirando in the 
Russian Foreign Ministry on 4 May; from the "Novosti" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer Pavel Ogorodnikov] Emomali Rakhmonov, the 
chairman of the National Assembly of Tajikistan, is beginning 
his visit to Moscow tomorrow [5 May]. It is expected that a 
complex of problems relating to political settlement both in 
Tajikistan itself, and on its border with Afghanistan, will be 
discussed during the talks. 
  [Shkirando] Anatoliy Leonidovich, what role is Tajikistan 
currently playing in Russia's life as a whole, apart from its 
foreign policy? 
  [Adamishin] In Tajikistan, a whole range of very important 
issues have, as it were, become interwoven, each of which 
directly affects the interests of Russia. Russia has made a 
considerable effort to extinguish the flame of civil war and 
find a way toward national reconciliation. 
  [Shkirando] Incidentally, the first round of Tajik-Tajik 
talks has just ended. To what extent has Moscow, and in 
particular the Foreign Ministry, succeeded in bringing the 
positions of the two sides closer together? 
  [Adamishin] The two sides have sat down round the 
negotiating 
table. This is something that we have tried to achieve several 
times. They have at last agreed that only a political 
settlement can be a route toward resolving Tajikistan's problems. 
  [Shkirando] One of the results of the first round of talks 
was the statement that both sides would stop hostilities in 
order to step up the process of talks. However, we know that 
explosions are still being heard on the border with Afghanistan. 
  [Adamishin] Regrettably, the phrasing they had there was 
less 
binding. Agreements in concrete terms are still to be concluded 
and, of course, serious criticisms can be made with regard to 
the opposition's behavior on the border. I will say this: It is 
necessary to continue this process to which the first Moscow 
round of talks has given a powerful impetus. 
  [Shkirando] What concrete results can be expected of Emomali 
Rakhmonov's visit to Moscow? 
  [Adamishin] I think all these problems will be discussed -- 
the problems of domestic political reforms in Tajikistan, of 
finding a common language with the opposition, of economic 
cooperation between Tajikistan and Russia, the problem of 
strengthening the border which is the border of the entire CIS 
-- this is in fact our border because, as I sometimes say, we 
have no other border between there and the Arctic Ocean, which 
requires defending. But there such factors are in play as arms 
smuggling, drug trafficking, and so on and so forth. This 
should be constantly borne in mind in order to realize the 
entire complexity of the situation in Tajikistan. Finally, the 
problem of the Russian-speaking population: Its numbers are 
decreasing in Tajikistan but they are still not small enough to 
be negligible. In a word, the whole gamut of our cooperation 
and involvement of the peacemaking forces will be the subject of 
the talks between the two heads of state.

statement to the ITAR-TASS correspondents: 
  "There has been an epoch-making event in the Republic of

transformations, shares with everyone a feeling of deep 
satisfaction at the results of these efforts. 
  "We believe that favorable prospects are opening up for the 
harmonious economic and social development of the peoples of 
South Africa. Much will depend on the readiness of all the 
country's political forces for constructive interaction similar 
to what they have shown during the period of preparations for 
the elections. 
  "Russia expresses its readiness to cooperate with the new 
democratic South Africa and hopes that the good relations that 
have been formed between our countries and peoples will in the

  [Text] The visit of the head of the Greek Foreign Ministry 
Karolas Papoulias to Moscow scheduled for May 3-5 "has been 
postponed for an indefinite term." The new date is to be 
coordinated via diplomatic channels, a top-ranking Russian 
diplomat in charge for Greece reported to Interfax. 
  He does not rule out that the contact between Russian 
Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Karolas Papoulias can take place in 
Cairo. 
  As it is known, on Tuesday Kozyrev came to Cairo, the 
Egyptian capital, to participate in signing of the agreement on 
Gaza Strip and Jericho between Israel and Palestine as a 
representative of the country-co-sponsor of the peaceful process 
in the Middle East. "As far as Papoulias is concerned, his 
presence in Cairo is also obligatory because at present Greece 
chairs the European Union," said Interfax interlocutor.

  [Text] More than 20 Tu-22 combat planes of two Black Sea 
Fleet aviation corps are prepared to be ferried to Russia, the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service told INTERFAX. 
  The press service said the command of the 2d aviation 
division of the Black Sea Fleet was "secretly preparing the 
action intended to be carried out during the next flight 
exercises of the Black Sea Fleet aviation." The planes are 
supposed to take off from the bases of Veseloye and Oktyabrskoye 
in Crimea, meet somewhere above the Azov Sea and land at the 
Krymsk military airdrome, Krasnodar territory. 
  The press service said that "any attempts to take military 
hardware and other material values belonging to the Black Sea 
Fleet are illegal and will inevitably lead to an aggravation of 
the situation around the division of the Black Sea Fleet." 
  The press center of the Black Sea Fleet told Interfax that 
the reports on ferrying Black Sea Fleet aviation to Russia were 
not true. The head of the press center, Andrey Grachev, said 
they were a "figment of the imagination" of the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry.

  [Text] As reported by the press service of the Defense 
Ministry, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry has come to know that 
the ferrying of over 20 Tu-22 missile-carrier combat aircraft to 
the Russian Federation is being made ready at two Black Sea 
Fleet aviation regiments. It is planned that the flight will be 
made against the background of regular tactical flight exercises 
of the Black Sea Fleet Air Force from the air bases of 
Oktyabrskoye and Veseloye in Crimea to the Russian military 
airfield in Krasnodarsk kray's Krymsk. 
  The press service of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry 
emphasizes that any attempts to transfer materiel and other 
Black Sea Fleet material wealth outside our state, are against 
the law and will inevitably lead to exacerbating the situation 
surrounding issues of dividing the Black Sea Fleet.

  [Excerpts] Kiev, 4 May -- "The election of a new parliament 
marked the end of a period of political indecision in Ukraine," 
said Alain Lamassoure, the French minister delegate for European 
affairs, at a news conference concluding an official visit to 
Ukraine by a French delegation. France is interested in 
expanding cooperation with the independent Ukrainian state, he 
said. To assist this, agreements have been signed in the course 
of the visit on the encouragement and protection of investments, 
on air transport, on cultural exchanges, and on youth and sport 
cooperation and exchanges. [passage omitted] During their visit 
to Ukraine, the French delegation discussed issues concerning 
energy resources and nuclear power engineering. France has 
proposed, Mr. Lamassoure noted, that issues regarding nuclear 
power engineering in Ukraine be discussed at the forthcoming G-7 
summit in Naples. 
  France is offering Ukraine help in preparing a project to 
shut down all generating sets at the Chernobyl nuclear electric 
power station and complete the construction of three generating 
sets at other nuclear electric power stations to compensate for 
power losses caused by the closure. "We do realize, however, 
that the cost of these projects is very high and that only 
international financial support will enable Ukraine to carry 
them out," Mr. Lamassoure stressed. France is ready to promise 
such support to Ukraine, he said.

  [Text] At the meeting in Kiev with the Minister for 
European Affairs, Alain Lamassoure, President Kravchuk expressed 
gratitude to France for help it provides to Ukraine in scrapping 
nuclear weapons and providing safety for nuclear power stations. 
He said that the country's leadership appreciates a change in 
the relationships between the West and Ukraine after the 
three-partite agreement on nuclear weapons was signed in Moscow. 
  France's representatives are part of the G-7 delegation 
currently in Ukraine, which arrived in the Republic to study the 
situation at Ukrainian nuclear power stations. Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov told reporters that Ukrainian leaders 
will sign no documents on the results of the visit with G-7 
inspectors. 
  INTERFAX note: The delegation includes senior officials of 
the G-7 nuclear energy ministries, the nuclear security fund of 
the European Bank for the Reconstruction and Development, the 
U.S. Department of State. The delegation intends to prepare 
materials for the G-7 summit in Naples, which explain the need 
of the economic aid to Ukraine. 
  Shmarov said that at their meeting members of the delegation 
expressed preparedness to provide a financial aid to Ukraine in 
the development of the nuclear energy and for higher level of 
safety at the Ukrainian nuclear power stations. This aid will 
be given if Ukraine refuses to commission the second block of 
the Chernobyl nuclear power station and agrees to the gradual 
closure of the first and third operating blocks.

  [Text] Kiev May 4 TASS -- G-7 countries understand 
Ukraine's concerns about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but 
have not made any commitments to extend much needed financial 
support, a Ukrainian high-ranking official said. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, 
Mikhail Umanets, chairman of the Ukrainian State Committee for 
Nuclear Power Engineering, said that Ukraine is ready to shut 
down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in return for financial 
assistance. 
  A Ukrainian governmental delegation met with a group of G-7 
officials in Kiev today to discuss the issue. The Ukrainian 
side said it needs over 3 billion U.S. dollars to go ahead with 
the plan of closure. 
  However, there has been no response from G-7 officials yet, 
Umanets said. He said that the matter has been handed over to a 
special working group set up today. 
  Detailed reports on the problem will be submitted to the 
upcoming G-7 summit meeting in Naples. Umanets did not rule out 
the possibility that "the sides will reach a consensus" in 
Naples.

  [Text] Yuriy Kostenko, Ukraine's environmental protection 
minister, on 4 May met representatives of a G-7 mission, which 
is on a visit to Ukraine. The visitors took interest in the 
problem of closing down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant as 
soon as possible and other issues relating to the use of 
radioactive materials in Ukraine. By closing down the Chernobyl 
AES, in the view of the mission's representatives, Ukraine would 
make a considerable contribution to guaranteeing the ecological 
safety of Europe. 
  Yuriy Kostenko said MinPryrody [Environmental Protection 
Ministry] was steadily insistent on the plant's closure. 
Because of Ukraine's complex economic situation, however, a 
speedy settlement to the issue, in the minister's view, is only 
possible given adequate financial and technological assistance 
from the G-7 countries. 
  As for the future of radioactive waste and used nuclear 
fuel, 
Yuriy Kostenko said that the only possible way for Ukraine now 
was to store them in makeshift depots until a national nuclear 
waste repository would be built.

  [Text] The continuing use of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station is a permanent source of danger not only for Ukraine, 
but also for other countries of the world, head of the G-7 
working group for nuclear security, Antonio Puri Purini said in 
Kiev Wednesday [4 May]. He is the head of a G-7 mission in 
Ukraine probing into the republic's nuclear security. 
  At his meeting with the mission's officials, Ukrainian 
Environmental Protection Minister Yuriy Kostenko drew everyone's 
attention to the fact that his ministry was the only body which 
insisted on immediate shut down of the station. 
  In Kostenko's opinion, measures taken to ensure the 
station's 
safety are not a guarantee that the surrounding territory would 
not be contaminated in case of an accident. 
  Kostenko pointed out that under the difficult economic 
situation faced currently by Ukraine a prompt solution of the 
Chernobyl issue was possible only provided "adequate" financial 
and technical assistance by G-7 countries. The minister pointed 
out that the situation was further complicated by nuclear 
disarmament underway in Ukraine, "which is an expensive and 
laborious process." 
  Commenting on dumping nuclear waste and exhausted fuel, 
Kostenko said the only acceptable variant for Ukraine would be 
storing such waste in temporary facilities until a stationary 
storage is constructed. 
  As INTERFAX-Ukraine learned, the deputies' group preparing 
the first session of the newly elected republican parliament had 
failed to include the commission for Chernobyl issues in the 
panel of commissions to be approved by the new parliament's 
first session. 
  The Ukrainian Party of Justice and the Chernobyl Union held 
a 
news conference in Kiev Wednesday calling on the deputies not to 
abolish the commission.

director, who leads a representative economic delegation on a 
visit to our country. There took place a friendly conversation, 
during the course of which a number of important issues relating 
to further developing bilateral cooperation was raised. 
  I am pleased about your delegation coming to us to settle 
some very important issues in accordance with the accord reached 
between President Clinton and myself, said Kravchuk. He went on 
to say: I have received a letter from President Bill Clinton 
saying that the delegation will work in three principal 
directions of mutual economic relations between our two states, 
which, above all, relates to the $350 million granted to 
Ukraine, the accord about which was reached earlier. The second 
direction is the development of trade and investment in this 
sphere, and the third has to do with reforming the Ukrainian 
economy and [securing] assistance from the United States of 
America in this matter. I was very glad to have received this 
letter on the eve of our meeting. 
  We are happy [to acknowledge] that very good relations have 
formed between our countries, Nicholas Burns told journalists. 
We came here to promote their further development. Our 
president holds President Kravchuk in great esteem and 
instructed us to do our best to bolster the formation of the 
best possible relations between the two countries and their 
governments.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, meeting on 
Wednesday the head of a delegation of U.S. economists, Nicholas 
Burns, expressed the hope that Ukraine's newly-elected 
parliament would ratify the Ukrainian-American agreements signed 
during his January visit to the United States. 
  The American economists have come to Ukraine, where they are 
due to stay till 6 May, to find out how the country could use 
the economic aid to a sum of $350 million the United States 
plans to give it. According to Kravchuk, America is going to 
help Ukraine reform its economy, make investments in it and step 
up trade with the country. 
  Following his meeting with Kravchuk, Burns said a 
Ukrainian-U.S. fund was due to be set up this summer to give 
loans to private Ukrainian businesses.

  "Ukraine regards the signing of a new Israeli-Palestinian 
accord on 4 May this year in Cairo as an important step toward a 
Middle East peace settlement, opening new prospects for defusing 
the Arab-Israeli conflict. The agreement signed provides an 
exceptional chance to extinguish the fire of the planet's 
longest conflict and start a new era of relations in the region. 
  "Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again declares 
its unchanging readiness to assist, on a bilateral as well as a 
multilateral basis, further removal of confrontation and the 
search for equal and mutually beneficial coexistence between 
Israel and the Arab region."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Maloveryan] </F>
  [Text] Tallinn, 5 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A regular round of 
Russian-Estonian talks started here today. It is devoted to 
work on a treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Estonia. 
  According to Vaino Reinart, head of the Estonian delegation, 
Estonia is ready to sign this act and Russia's desire to link 
this problem with the provision of social guarantees to the 
Russian military pensioners residing in the republic is the only 
stumbling block. 
  On the eve of the round Vasiliy Svirin, head of the Russian 
delegation, met with Estonian President Lennart Meri. The 
results of the conversation, he believes, give cause for hope 
that in a prolonged Russian-Estonian "divorce suit dialogue" the 
parties can find strength and willingness to engage in a search 
for a compromise to settle the problem. 
  The talks are being held behind closed doors and will last 
for two days. It is planned that a news conference will be 
given by the heads of delegations on the results of the talks.

  [Excerpt] Tallinn, May 04, BNS -- The head of the Estonian 
Border Guard Department and the Russian embassy's military 
attache in Tallinn at a private meeting this week decided that 
the border- related departments of both countries will 
themselves try to find out who is responsible for letting 
illegal Kurdish immigrants across the border and whether Russia 
should take back the Kurds. 
  The departments in Estonia and Russia must resolve the issue 
of the Kurds without creating a strife between themselves or 
interference by the world community, Tarmo Kouts, the head of 
the Estonian border department said. 
  Kouts at the meeting requested from Russian Military Attache 
Anatoli Tschizhikov that Russia answer to letters by the 
Estonian department concerning the Kurds' illegal crossing of 
the border. 
  Kouts told BNS he hopes to get an answer by Friday [6 May]. 
  "From that answer we will be able to conclude whether the 
issue can be settled at our departments' level or has to be 
referred to the Foreign Ministry and the broader public."

  [Text] An Interior Ministry official denied the reports of 
a coup plan prepared by Russian officers, announced by MP Mart 
Niklus at a picket at the Russian naval HQ on Monday [2 May]. 
Niklus had declared that a secret meeting of Russian officers 
took place in Tartu on April 23 where an armed coup was 
discussed. He further claimed that the conspirators are armed 
and have cells in different regions of Estonia. 
  The PEVALEHT reports that a dismissed Defence League member 
had sent a letter recently to President Lennart Meri and 
Commander in Chief General Aleksander Einseln, claiming that 
retired Russian officers had been preparing a coup at the 
aforementioned date. The man had added that some servicemen of 
the Estonia Defence Forces have been involved in the preparation. 
  An unnamed Interior Ministry official dismissed the report, 
explaining that April 23 had been the day of the payment of 
pensions to the retired Russian military and their possible 
expressions of dissatisfaction can hardly be qualified as a 
preparation of coup attempt.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 03, BNS -- The Bank of Estonia in a 
study delivered to the parliament explores the reasons behind 
the last months' increasing rise in consumer prices and wages 
the viability of measures to get the inflation under control. 
  The survey shows that the current relatively high inflation 
rates are a natural phenomenon for an economy in transition like 
ours, said Kaupo Pollisinski, chief spokesman for the central 
bank. 
  The rise in the consumer price index in Estonia for the 
first 
three months of the year ended at nearly 20 percent, smashing 
hopes to keep inflation within the far more optimistic estimates 
made last year end. Topping the disappointing monthly figures 
was a record 8.9 percent inflation for a single month in March. 
  The central bank in its study says the record inflation in 
March was caused 92 percent by a rise in the spending on 
housing, food, transport and communications. 
  The price rise in March above all hit people in the lower 
income group of the society, the central bank says. The 
consumer price index for the less well-off was 2.5 percent 
higher than that for the richer population, or 7.9 and 5.4 
percent, respectively. For the last four months, inflation has 
been 6.1 percent higher for families in the low income group 
than those in the upper segment. The purchase basket of food 
became 24.5 percent more expensive for the lower income group 
over the January-March period. The rise in the same sector for 
the high-income segment was 18.4 percent. 
  Experts at the Bank of Estonia say there are four main 
factors that effect inflation most in Estonia: - the ongoing 
opening of the economy; - higher growth rates in the 
productivity of work when compared to the industrially developed 
countries; - arising from this is the continuing difference of 
the price level in Estonia from that of the foreign countries. 
Also to be taken into account is that the price level in one of 
Estonia's main trade partners -- Russia -- has been extremely 
unstable; - the fixed exchange rate of the Estonian kroon to the 
German mark.

  [Text] Riga, May 04, BNS -- The Latvian Cabinet accepted 
Tuesday [3 May] a law on ports providing for the use, management 
and security of ports, Communication Minister Andris Gutmanis 
said at a press conference. 
  The law is urgent in the present situation of growing 
competition between Baltic sea ports because it will help to 
improve the main legislative drawbacks concerning national and 
municipal port ownership, Gutmanis said. 
  The planned revenue from port operation in 1994 is 15.5 
million lats from which 1.1 million lats will be transferred to 
local budgets to develop port territory infrastructures. 
  Under the law, port duties are covered by owners of cargo.

  [Text] Riga, May 04, BNS -- The Latvian state border is 
practically unguarded but it is being relatively controlled, 
Frontier Guard Brigade Cmdr. Janis Adamsons told reporters on 
return from a border inspection trip. 
  The border control is hampered by the acute lack of funding 
and equipment, as well as inefficiency of certain officials. 
  The Frontier Brigade received 42 percent of the required 
minimal funding this year, Adamsons said. Border guards have 47 
percent of needed vehicles not speaking about specific 
technologies, he noted. 
  Many work organization problems also wait for solution, the 
commander said. For example, several units are stationed 70 
kilometers from frontier, he said. 
  The average discipline of guards is "rather poor," said 
Adamsons, "separate unit chiefs imagine that they can take 
nation-scope decisions." 
  During the spot check, Adamsons fired 12 officers. He, 
however, denied it being "personnel cleansing" because the 
sacked people were unprofessional and lacked discipline. 
  Adamsons called absurd the present situation when serving 
border guards face 92 criminal charges or former convicts join 
the staff. 
  The economic protection of Latvia stands the main task of 
border guards in the present situation, said Adamsons. The 
large quantity of imported food blocks the development of local 
agriculture, he said. 
  According to guards' estimates, 20 percent of imported food 
is contraband. 
  Adamsons said the brigade command will propose the 
government 
to allow border guards to confiscate not only the illegal cargos 
but also the vehicles that carry them. 
  The Latvian Border Guard Brigade has a personnel of 4,000. 
Around 900 border guards work on the border daily checking 8,500 
Latvian citizens and 10,000 visitors.

  [Text] Riga, May 04, BNS -- Latvian Saeima (parliament) 
Speaker Anatolijs Gorbunovs addressed reporters Wednesday [4 
May] with a speech, dedicated to the adoption of the 
Independence Declaration on May 4, 1990. 
  In his address, Gorbunovs thanked the former Supreme Council 
deputies who started to form the structures of the independent 
state regardless of the counteractions by Moscow administration. 
  Commenting on the present political situation, Gorbunovs 
said 
he could "support radical changes in the life of our society" if 
it stabilized the Latvian situation. 
  The most important future issue is the choice of Latvian 
citizens on the chief issues of national development and 
politics, Gorbunovs said. 
  Answering on journalists' questions, Gorbunovs said he hoped 
that the Saeima opposition and the ruling coalition would narrow 
their differences to avoid hampering the work of the parliament. 
  Gorbunovs said that the opposition ideas to propose 
extraordinary Saeima elections were logical from the opposition 
viewpoint because it could not have more influence in the 
present Saeima as it already had. 
  "The government of the Latvia's Way and the Farmers' Union 
is 
a minority government but the government that the opposition 
could form would be even more unstable minority government," 
said Gorbunovs. 
  Gorbunovs characterized as immature the idea to adopt a 
public reconciliation declaration because "the issues of the 
offenses by former KGBs and communist nomenklatura officials 
have not been sufficiently considered yet." "People who were 
humiliated now wait for amends," he noted. 
  Finally, Gorbunovs claimed that the Constitution should be 
amended to avoid various interpretations by deputies.

  [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine's Acting Prime-Minister Yefim 
Zvyahilskyy on 4 May met a government delegation from the 
Republic of Crimea led by Crimea's Vice-Premier Yevgeniy 
Saburov, the press service of the president and Cabinet of 
Ministers reports. They discussed issues concerning the 
economic situation in the autonomous republic. Yevgeniy Saburov 
shared his view on ways to overcome the crisis phenomena and 
gave a detailed account of the concrete steps taken by the 
Crimean government to that effect. He emphasized that his 
actions were guided by the fact that Crimea was a constituent 
part of Ukraine. Yefim Zvyahilskyy noted that Ukrainian 
legislation allows the Republic of Crimea sufficient powers to 
pursue an economic course that would take account of the 
peninsula's peculiarities, and that the government of Ukraine 
was prepared for a constructive dialogue in search of mutually 
acceptable solutions aimed at improving the people's well-being. 
  Ukraine's acting prime-minister inquired about the state of 
Crimea's agriculture. Everything possible must be done, he 
said, to gather the harvest without losses and provide the 
peninsula's population with food. 
  The heads of relevant Ukrainian departments were instructed 
to resolve operational issues raised by the Crimean government 
representatives. 
  The meeting was attended by Ukraine's Vice-Premier Valentyn 
Landyk.

is your friend..." recently at the "Vulkan" factory in Kiev. 
Before my departure to Kharkov for a meeting with managing 
directors of CIS and Ukrainian industrial enterprises, I learned 
that the "Vulkan" working collective was the first Kiev 
enterprise to nominate Volodymyr Lanovyy for head of state. Now 
I understand what their words meant. 
  Old disputes over who is currently more important for 
Ukraine 
-- a flexible politician, competent lawyer, or pragmatic 
economist -- have most likely brought us to a conciliatory 
conclusion: Ukraine requires all three of them. However, the 
third one is more important. The realization of difficulties of 
our economic reality will most likely not play the final part in 
choosing the future president. 
  The invitation of V.T. Lanovyy, 42-year-old doctor of 
economic sciences and former prime minister, to meet with 
managing directors of more than 150 enterprises in Ukraine, 
Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Latvia, and Moldova shows, of 
course, that he is recognized as an authoritative economist and 
practical manager. [passage omitted] 
  When drafting a state budget, it is necessary to change the 
tax structure: To issue payments to local budgets and drop tax 
payments to the central Republican organs (except the most 
essential ones), Volodymyr Lanovyy says. These payments should 
not be redistributed and regions should have a free hand in 
dealing with their budgets. 
  The president of the Center for Market Reforms cited these 
figures: In 1993, the budget received only 40 percent of 
expected tax payments while during last January-February -- only 
25 percent of planned payments. 
  As for the insolvency of Ukraine, the presidential 
candidate: 
"Ukraine is solvent. It has a large currency potential, but the 
funds are not kept in the state. It is not profitable to bring 
currency into the state. I categorically oppose the practice of 
enterprises having to sell their earned currency to the state. 
This money should be deposited in Ukrainian banks. If this is 
not done, exporters will continue holding their money abroad. 
Excessive customs duties and export restrictions should be 
removed. Different currency rates and licensing have lead to 
under-the-counter deals: The one who buys currency at a lower 
rate, is always tempted to sell it at a higher rate. Volodymyr 
Lanovyy concludes that we have a unique situation. Due to the 
restrictive policy and the system of currency regulation, we 
export capital at a time when we most need it." [quotation marks 
as published] 
  Answering a question as to whether the system of tax breaks 
is justified, Volodymyr Lanovyy remarked: "A system of tax 
breaks is permissible if payments for some percent of the credit 
are made with funds from the state budget. Such credits are 
necessary to achieve structural changes and encourage 
unprofitable sectors. In Ukraine, the issuing of loans is 
always unplanned and is carried out through currency emissions 
and the lowering of interest rates. In 1993, the average 
interest rate was twice as low as the minimum interest rate 
offered by the National Bank. Thereby, tax breaks are mandatory 
elements of the government's structural policy and should be 
economically grounded, based on the technological reorganization 
of an enterprise, its profitability, conditions for providing 
new jobs, etc." 
  Estimating the current economic situation, Volodymyr Lanovyy 
stated: "Currently, economic policy is being shaped without 
considering its final results. The blind are leading the 
people." 
  The corps of managing directors did not object to this. 
Academician A. G. Aganbegyan, president of the All-Union Club of 
Directors and a well-known economist, summarized, in my opinion, 
the viewpoint of the majority: "The sooner Lanovyy and his 
followers are able to implement reforms, the quicker the revival 
of the Ukrainian economy will begin." 
  I heard more or less the same opinions at factories in 
Kharkov -- which were visited by the presidential candidate -- 
and at the House of Architects, where he organized a news 
conference with journalists. There is one curious detail: 
There are a considerable number of people, both among 
journalists and industrialists, who are ready to support Lanovyy 
during the presidential campaign.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 4 May TASS -- Viktor Pinzenik, a candidate for 
the Ukrainian presidency, one of the prominent Ukrainian 
economist and former vice-premier, has dropped out of the 
presidential race. He announced his decision on Wednesday but 
declined to give the reasons for the move. 
  It looks like supporters of market reforms are staking on 
former Economics Minister Vladimir Lanovoy, 42, organiser of the 
"reforms for the people" parliamentary faction, president of the 
centre of market reforms and master of economic sciences. He 
stands a better chance of being elected than Pinzenik, since 
Lanovoy is believed to be the "victim" of cabinet games. 
  When Lanovoy was an economics minister and vice-premier, he 
suggested several programmes of coming out of the crisis which 
were blocked both by the cabinet of ministers and the 
parliament. During the current election campaign Lanovoy has 
been insisting on these programmes again, saying that this will 
bring about economic recovery of the country. 
  One of the real candidates to the presidential post, Leonid 
Kravchuk, maintains his former position, saying that elections 
should be postponed until later. He motivates his position by 
the absence of a new constitution, an indefinite status of the 
president and an inadequate structure of the executive power. A 
total of 120 Ukrainian lawmakers had come out in support of 
Kravchuk's position, demanding in an address the nation that the 
presidential elections be postponed. 
  This caused a stormy reaction from other lawmakers and 
primarily, those contesting for the post of the president. 
Former speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, Ivan Plyushch, is 
busy finding out the names of those who signed the address. The 
Ukrainian parliament has been putting pressure on the Ukrainian 
UKRINFORM news agency which circulated the address in a bid to 
get a list of the 120 lawmakers who put their signatures under 
the document.

  [Excerpts] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Working groups 
of Ukrainian people's deputies continued their meetings on today 
to prepare proposals on the new Supreme Council's working 
bodies, the draft agenda of the Supreme Council's first session, 
its media coverage, amendments to Ukraine's Constitution, 
procedural rules for plenary sessions, and proposals on 
Ukraine's way out of the economic crisis. Around 70 people's 
deputies are working in the sub-groups representing all 
Ukrainian oblasts, as well as political parties and public 
organizations. They have prepared a draft agenda for the 13th 
convocation of the first session of the Supreme Council to be 
held in May-July, including, apart from the appointment of the 
Supreme Council's leadership and the government, a report by the 
president of Ukraine: "On the political and socioeconomic 
situation," reports by the Cabinet of Ministers and the National 
Bank of Ukraine, as well as debates on the draft Constitution of 
Ukraine, a draft Supreme Council resolution on the division of 
state assets between Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea, and 
appointment of the Constitutional Court, etc. 
  The working groups are discussing the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council's prospective committees. However, proposals differ 
considerably from group to group. [passage omitted] 
  Members of the working groups are to hold a joint session 
chaired by Vasyl Durdynets, former first deputy chairman of the 
Supreme Council, to coordinate the proposals. According to 
confidential sources, Vasyl Durdynets is one of the surest 
candidates for the post of Supreme Council speaker.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleksa Kurpas: "Monetarism: `Pros' and `Cons'"] </F>
  [Text] Over the last quarter of 1993, the prices in 
Ukraine rose by 89 percent and the amount of money in 
circulation -- by 17 percent. This is the government's monetary 
policy, when uncovered karbovantsi are not issued. Acting Prime 
Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy is the country's chief monetarist. 
  Mr. Zvyahilskyy says that, owing to the introduction of the 
financial rate of currencies and the stringent monetary policy, 
inflation could be curbed and that now it amounts to about 20 
percent a month (against 300 percent last year). 
  However, monetarism is a double-edged weapon. Ex-prime 
minister Leonid Kuchma stresses that it is such a policy that 
has led to the crisis in industry. As of today, the debts of 
our enterprises in credits amount to 134.1 trillion karbovantsi 
[K] and in debits to K101.4 billion. In order to emerge from 
this situation, bills of exchange should have been introduced. 
However, for some reason, this procedure is being delayed. The 
Ministry of Finance, with Hryhoriy Pyatachenko at the head, 
refuses to redeem those bills of exchange that enterprises or 
private persons hold. 
  Chairman of Ukraine's National Bank Viktor Yushchenko is yet 
another advocate of monetarism. It still remains a mystery on 
what principles he distributes the credits. It was only under 
the pressure of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs [USPP] (with Leonid Kuchma as president) that 
industry received from Ukraine's National Bank K5.4 trillion in 
stabilization credits and K5.5 trillion in assistance. However, 
today's needs are much greater. To be sure, the karbovanets of 
the unpaid wages results in two or three karbovantsi of 
nonpayments. Because of this, members of the USPP are 
threatening to disband Ukraine's National Bank and instead, 
create some mysterious institution that will grant credits to 
everybody. 
  Minister of Economics Roman Shpek says that this policy is 
meant for stabilizing the economic situation. However, in 
reality, it turns out that enterprises are becoming hostages to 
Zvyahilskyy and company. In the opinion of Volodymyr Lanovyy 
[former minister of economics], monetary policy is necessary, 
but only under the conditions of a stable economy, or else the 
state is simply covering up truly bankrupt enterprises, replaces 
real unemployment by a hidden one, and will lead the economy to 
total collapse.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 04, BNS -- Russia must return all KGB 
archives that were taken out of Lithuania after the August coup 
in 1991, says Jurgis Jurgelis, director of the Lithuanian 
Security Department. 
  The Russian ambassador to Lithuania earlier said that Russia 
sees no legal basis for talks on the return of KGB archives. 
But in Jurgelis' view, "the law is not necessary to return what 
was stolen." 
  In an interview with Lithuania's top daily LIETUVOS RYTAS, 
Jurgelis said Russia took out part of KGB files when Lithuania 
restored its independence and became a sovereign state. Russia 
also refuses to return any of the pre-war archives of Lithuanian 
security services. 
  Jurgelis confirmed that around "11 or 12 sacks" of 
information were stolen from the foreign intelligence department 
of the KGB when the KGB building in Vilnius was taken over by 
Lithuanian authorities soon after the 1991 coup. "There is no 
doubt that the KGB files are in private hands," but the case was 
closed due to lack of evidence, as well as because witnesses 
changed their testimonies. Jurgelis confirmed that KGB 
documents were used for blackmail in several cases. 
  The official said his department has information about 
activities of foreign secret services in Lithuania but declined 
to mention any details.

  [Text] Vilnius, May 04, BNS -- All political forces in the 
Lithuanian parliament agree that the value-added tax, which came 
in to effect May 1 replacing the general excise tax, is 
necessary, members of the parliament's Budget and Finance 
Committee told reporters Wednesday [4 May]. 
  The overall price increase should reach around 7 to 9 
percent, and although prices for some goods will go even higher, 
more than half of all prices should remain the same, said social 
democrat Audrius Rudys. 
  Rimantas Stanikunas, head of the State Prices and 
Competition 
Service, said higher bread prices, which should go up by around 
20 percent, will be the worst experience for consumers. He said 
the service and bakeries in Vilnius will try to keep bread 
prices as low as possible. 
  Members of the Budget and Finance Committee, all of whom 
represent different political parties, said prices should jump 
only once. In their words, some store owners may use the 
opportunity to inflate prices. But the competition service said 
it will take strict measures against enterprises which will 
ungroundedly increase state-controlled prices. The lawmakers 
said all other prices should be regulated by the market. 
  Rudys said the price increase is "the price to be paid for 
proper order in the tax system." He said producers and sellers 
will avoid non-registered payers of the value-added tax. 
Besides, the lawmaker said, the new tax will also help collect 
other taxes which are now concealed. 
  Rudys noted, however, that not enough effort was made to 
explain the essence of the new tax to the public, while 
explanatory work usually takes more than a year in other 
countries. 
  The new tax is expected to increase budget receipts by 2 to 
3 
percent. Lithuania's 18-percent tax is smaller than in a 
majority of European countries where the value-added tax is 18 
to 21 percent, and as much as 25 percent in Denmark.

<F P=106> [Interview with Adolfas Slezevicius, Lithuanian prime </F>
minister and LDDP chairman, by GK and DS in Vilnius; date not 
given: "A. Slezevicius: 'We Will Stand the Test of Power'"] 
  [Excerpt] As we have already reported, Adolfas 
Slezevicius, the country's prime minister and chairman of the 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], paid a visit to the 
TIESA editorial office. 
  Today, we are publishing his replies to the questions from 
TIESA reporters. 
  [TIESA] The public is currently being incited by the 
possible interpellation to the government. The document was 
signed by representatives of an interesting coalition -- the 
Social Democrats, the Nationalists, the Democrats, and even two 
members of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] faction. 
  How could you explain the activeness of the Social 
Democrats, although the programs of the two parties are similar, 
and particularly the move of K. Jaskelevicius and A. 
Ivaskevicius [LDDP members]? 
  [Slezevicius] I have said and can repeat that an 
interpellation is a constitutional right. Not being numerous 
and having few representatives in the Seimas [parliament], the 
Lithuanian Social Democratic Party sometimes wants to attract 
the attention of others. This may be correct from the viewpoint 
of the party. However, the frequent change of governments -- 
ours is the sixth one -- is damaging to the country's stability 
and economic reform. I have read the Social Democrats' 
documents and I know who drafted them -- I have not found any 
original proposals as to how to improve the situation. 
  The Social Democrats are extremely envious of LDDP efforts 
to 
become a member of the Socialist International. This may imply 
the desire to prove that there can be no close cooperation 
between the two parties. 
  This may also mean a hint at a coalition. 
  The fact that the chairman of the LDDP, which won the 
elections, is the head of the government means the first attempt 
to follow the course of Western democratic tradition. According 
to this model, party members in the Seimas faction should 
observe discipline because otherwise they could be recalled. 
Unfortunately, Lithuania is still a "unique" country or, in 
other words, the "land of wonders." Therefore, even an LDDP 
Council Presidium member can sign an interpellation to the 
government headed by the party leader. 
  There are some LDDP members who do not fit in the faction, 
while the procedure of recalling is not defined. We will, 
probably, begin to implement the latter only after the elections 
to local governments. 
  At the same time, I would like to admit that the advocates 
of 
the interpellation also voice justified criticism. The 
government's work has shortcomings, and we see them. Not 
everything is done by fixed deadlines. However, we do have a 
program and preserve the key trends in our work. Thus, in my 
opinion, it is beneficial to the country that the activities of 
the government are corrected and that governments are not 
changed. 
  [TIESA] Many people notice that while in power, the 
LDDP is beginning to follow the policy of Sajudis in the former 
Supreme Council, when internal strife turned it into a minority. 
Might it happen that early elections will be inspired by the 
majority itself rather than the opposition? 
  [Slezevicius] I am far from such pessimism. We have diverse 
and smart people in the Seimas. We do not need an amorphous 
monolith. On the other hand, it is regrettable that sometimes 
the actions of LDDP representatives cause much joy to the 
opposition and its press. 
  A split in the LDDP ranks has been predicted and expected 
for 
a long time. I suppose, however, that we will stand the test of 
power. 
  [TIESA] Hardly anyone can tell today, approximately 
what part of the necessary taxes is collected by the government 
-- maybe, one-fourth or 60 percent. This must be the most 
pressing problem of the day. Failure to resolve it will 
increase the disproportion between the rich and the poor, and 
will continue to harm the least protected social groups. What 
does the government intend to do to collect at least the major 
part of taxes? 
  [Slezevicius] I would not like to use the term "to collect 
taxes." State-conscious citizens should pay taxes themselves. 
Unfortunately, this problem is really pressing. Illegal trade 
in smuggled alcohol and tobacco has reached dangerous 
proportions in all aspects. It demoralizes society and 
encourages chaos on the market. Local producers cannot compete, 
while smugglers, certainly, do not pay taxes. However, we will 
not eradicate this problem by one resolution or another. We 
require an entire set of coordinated measures. 
  Throughout the civilized world, 90 percent of tax money 
comprises four taxes -- the value added tax, the taxes on 
incomes of physical and juridical persons, and excise duties. 
The creation of a similar system is nearing completion in 
Lithuania. Subsequent moves that we will have to make are to 
enhance the responsibility for the non-payment of taxes and 
strengthen the operation of inspection offices. We are already 
demanding great responsibility for contraband. It will be 
necessary to reinforce the economic police which will have to 
cooperate with the tax inspection. Therefore, the economic 
police will receive additional staff in the near future. 
  Privileges which we have granted to insolvent enterprises by 
canceling the deadline for paying taxes pursue one goal -- to 
retrieve taxes owed to the state, even though later. 
  We intend to impose order in the register of enterprises in 
the immediate future. Currently, we have 110,000 economic 
entities registered, while taxes are paid by a considerably 
smaller number of enterprises. Entrusting the register to the 
Finance Ministry, it would be much easier to control the payment 
of taxes. We are also considering the possibility of assigning 
this task to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. However, we 
doubt whether social organizations will manage to fulfill those 
functions efficiently. 
  [TIESA] We will have to apply the bankruptcy law sooner 
or later. It is this measure that will allow us to replace an 
inefficient manager of an enterprise with an efficient person, 
restructure the economy, and make production more effective. 
The government's hesitation is understandable, because the 
announcement of the bankruptcies of all insolvent entities would 
mean mass unemployment. However, we will have to bring 
ourselves to do this at some time. When will this moment 
come? 
  [Slezevicius] We have already announced bankruptcies of 10 
enterprises. Certainly, this, as well as the unemployment rate, 
does not reflect the actual situation. However, the initiative 
for bankruptcies should come from creditors. The government's 
task is to facilitate this procedure. We have already 
accomplished this in principle. 
  [TIESA] However, it is the government who is this 
creditor most often. Before 1 March, the debt of economic 
entities for unpaid taxes to the budget was about 0.5 billion 
litai. Who should begin the bankruptcy procedure for such 
enterprises? 
  [Slezevicius] The current debt to the budget has really 
exceeded 0.5 billion litai. Moreover, the "Sodra" [state 
insurance company] budget did not receive another 130 million 
litai. However, formulating the problem in this way, we should 
state our goal: Do we want those 200 insolvent enterprises to 
go broke, although many of them are already getting back on 
their feet, have found their place in the market, and have 
chances for repaying the debt in the near future, or do we want 
to cancel the deadline for their debt and wait until the money 
returns to the budget, albeit later? The government has chosen 
the second way. One must bear in mind that half of all unpaid 
revenues accounts for interest. Thus, we have proposed to 
enterprises to reach agreements with tax inspections so that the 
latter cancel the payment of taxes and do not charge any 
interest during that time. Having done this, we should receive 
about 170 million litai in budget revenues this year alone, 
which we would otherwise have to write off. The budget deficit 
is estimated at exactly this sum. Furthermore, this will help 
enterprises overcome the shortage of working capital which is 
the outcome of hyperinflation. 
  [TIESA] Will not the tying of the litas to the U.S. 
dollar impair Lithuanian exports? 
  [Slezevicius] I think that such fears are totally unfounded. 
On the contrary, a stable currency will promote investments in 
production, enhance the latter, as well as the possibilities of 
exports. 
  [TIESA] Agriculture will not survive without support. 
Who and how much will you support? 
  [Slezevicius] We cannot say today what farms and of what 
size 
will be effective in Lithuania. Farmers themselves and the 
market must reply to this question. The government must create 
conditions for the emergence of genuine owners and a real 
market. I believe that the president was right in returning the 
land law to the Seimas, one clause of which envisions the 
nationalization of land that has no owner. This law is the last 
one among those on land reform and it must be precise. 
  The issue of support is even more complicated. It is all 
very well to subsidize farmers for the governments of those 
countries where their produce accounts for some 5 percent of the 
GNP, and a large part of it is sold on the domestic market. Our 
agriculture produces almost half of the GNP, and about 
two-thirds of this produce is exported. Thus, we have no 
resources for subsidies. Even if we had, are prices for exports 
worth reducing and consumers of other countries worth 
supporting? We are not the United States which can afford this. 
  We understand perfectly well that Lithuania was, is, and 
will be an agricultural country. Farmers will not manage without 
government support. We will do this in two ways. First of all, 
we will protect our market from imported produce with customs 
duties. For example, Estonia is following another course, it 
has opened all borders to imported farm products. 
  We will not leave our farmers, who have not yet reached the 
level of effective production of developed countries, to such a 
fate. 
  The other way is to extend preferential credits. The 
government's task is to find and give them to the most promising 
producers. 
  [TIESA] Rumors are again spreading about the 
reorganization of ministries. Some of them are to be merged, 
while others -- divided. Is this a principle, or do such 
decisions depend on personalities? 
  [Slezevicius] Talk is usually more interesting and richer in 
imagination than in reality. 
  We have adopted a decision concerning the division of the 
Ministry of Culture and that of Education and Science. The 
Environmental Protection Department, which was subordinate to 
the Seimas, will become a ministry. 
  The Constitution does not envision deputy prime ministers, 
while reform issues are complicated. We propose two offices of 
state ministers. One of them would handle economic reform, and 
the other -- issues of local governments. 
  I would like to reassure the tax payers that these changes 
will not increase the number of officials, and we will use only 
the money allocated from the budget. 
  Certainly, I wish this reorganization sped up educational 
reform, improved the work of self-governments, upgraded 
privatization, and so on. 
  [TIESA] The trial of the former Lithuanian Bank manager 
has just ended. Mr. Romualdas Visokavicius has been acquitted. 
LIETUVOS RYTAS commentator Rimvydas Valatka -- and the newspaper 
vouches for this respectable banker -- stated that these 
proceedings struck a crushing blow to your reputation. 
  [Slezevicius] Mr. Valatka is particularly attentive to my 
person, and I am grateful for this. I do not know in what terms 
he measured this crushing blow, but I did not feel it. 
  It is regrettable that all cases in our country acquire 
political clothing, and Mr. Visokavicius called himself even the 
cannon fodder of political games. 
  The question of a LIETUVOS RYTAS reporter whether Mr. 
Visokavicius will apply for his restoration to work is strange. 
So is the banker's reply: "I do not know." The Seimas 
dismissed the manager not for the loan to the "Litimpex" bank 
but for the monetary policy that inflicted great losses on the 
country's economy. 
  [TIESA] The political treaty on good-neighborly 
relations with Poland should be signed shortly. It should begin 
a new and mutually beneficial stage in cooperation between both 
countries. What are the relations with Russia and Belarus? 
  [Slezevicius] Dialogue is under way, but it is not as 
fruitful as we would like. 
  It is regretful that Russia is trying to restrict some 
agreements with new conditions. For example, the most favored 
nation status is still frozen. Russia wants to link it with the 
Kaliningrad Oblast issue. 
  Mr. Yuriy Matochkin, leader of the Oblast Administration, 
has 
been authorized by the Russian prime minister to conduct 
negotiations with Lithuania. A meeting with him should take 
place in the near future. 
  Cooperation with Belarus is impaired by the complicated 
political situation in that country. Quite a number of 
agreements have been submitted for signing. 
  [TIESA] How often do you read TIESA? How do you assess 
it? Why does a newspaper which actually supports the current 
government have the most modest material conditions? 
  [Slezevicius] Of course, I read it every day, and I find 
many 
interesting publications and readers' comments. I agree that 
TIESA today is more modest than other newspapers. There are 
several reasons. One of them is that the LDDP did not reward 
the paper as rapidly as did our opponents with the "state 
newspaper" [reference to LIETUVOS AIDAS]. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with IMF representative in Lithuania P. Cornelius </F>
by ELTA under the "Loans" rubric; place and date not given: 
"IMF Does Not Waste Resources"] 
  [Text] In October of 1993, the IMF Executive Council 
approved a program for Lithuania which is comprised of two parts 
-- the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum (continuous 
financial assistance) and the so-called system transformation 
loan. These resources are allocated to support Lithuania's 
economic reform which will be conducted for a year and a half -- 
from the middle of 1993 to late 1994. IMF representative in 
Lithuania P. Cornelius has commented on this assistance rendered 
by the IMF to an ELTA correspondent. 
  [ELTA] What is the difference between an IMF loan 
extended according to the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum 
from that of system transformation? 
  [Cornelius] According to system transformation loans, 
Lithuania can receive its quota of 50 percent, while according 
to the memorandum -- 25 percent (Lithuania's quota in the IMF is 
about $145 million). This money is paid in separate 
installments, that is, the total is not paid in bulk. 
  The IMF extends system transformation loans mostly to those 
countries which are experiencing a so-called trade shock. 
Lithuania had this situation when oil and gas prices jumped to 
the world level. According to this loan, Lithuania's 25-percent 
quota, which is about $26 million, was paid out in October of 
1993. The country received another $36-million quota according 
to the system transformation loan several weeks ago -- on 8 
April. These finances must be utilized to settle payment 
balances. 
  [ELTA] What about loans under the Lithuanian economic 
policy memorandum? 
  [Cornelius] These are extended to Lithuania to enlarge its 
fund for stabilizing the national currency. Your country will 
receive this money in five installments. Lithuania received 5 
percent of its quota -- $7 million -- in October of 1993. It 
will get the remaining 5-percent installments if it meets 
certain economic requirements. 
  According to the requirements that Lithuania had to fulfill 
by late March of this year, another 5-percent installment must 
be paid out to Lithuania in mid May, while the remaining two -- 
in the middle of November, and in February of 1995. Lithuania 
can use this money in exceptional cases as domestic loans. Its 
key goal now is to enhance our trust in the newly established 
Currencies Council. 
  [ELTA] IMF loans directly depend on the situation in 
the Lithuanian economy. How does the IMF Executive Council 
assess it? 
  [Cornelius] Lithuania's great progress in stabilizing its 
macroeconomic situation is noticeable, particularly concerning 
inflation which has dropped to a monthly rate of 3-4 percent. 
There are very many signs proving that the economic operation 
of the state sector is reviving. Tendencies that make the 
entire economy more dynamic have intensified, and the private 
sector is developing and expanding rapidly. 
  Before the establishment of the Currencies Council, 
Lithuanian banks toughened their monetary policy and noticeably 
reduced inflation. The fiscal policy is also very strict, and 
Lithuania's state budget is balanced. This also contributed to 
the stabilization of the macroeconomic system. One must also 
mention progress in terms of structure. Lithuania's move toward 
reform of import and export tariffs -- when import duties were 
abolished or reduced to a minimum -- is welcome. This will 
enhance the level of Lithuania's economic reliability and 
productivity. The replacement of the general excise tax with 
the value added tax, and the establishment of the Currencies 
Council will also have a favorable effect on the state budget. 
  In our opinion, all these prominent changes ensue from 
economic progress and the correctly chosen economic policy, even 
though we must remain cautious. There are some spheres, 
however, on which Lithuania should focus more. These are 
privatization, reform in the financial sector, and the personal 
income tax. 
  [ELTA] The Lithuanian economic policy memorandum is 
valid until the end of this year. We have heard that there are 
plans to draft another program for three years. 
  [Cornelius] Discussions on the drafting of a new program for 
Lithuania are already under way. The Lithuanian Government has 
expressed a desire to draft this program according to the 
so-called extended IMF loan which would embrace three years of 
Lithuania's economic policy. Its key goal is to focus on 
structural issues. Thus far, we have discussed general 
guidelines with the Lithuanian Government, which could serve as 
the basis for providing an extended loan. An IMF mission is 
scheduled to arrive from Washington this Wednesday [20 Apr]. 
Its representatives along with the Lithuanian Government will 
specify the economic policy measures that Lithuania intends to 
adopt with the aim of receiving this loan. 
  We believe that the IMF can provide an extended loan 
immediately after the term of the current economic policy 
memorandum expires. However, the drafting of a new program 
requires at least two IMF missions so as to discuss all the 
details in developing Lithuania's economy. 
  [ELTA] What does the Lithuanian economy lack most of 
all to make its reform more rapid? 
  [Cornelius] More attention should be devoted to the 
so-called 
structural reform and spheres that must be strengthened more 
rapidly. This is reform in the financial sector, laws on the 
Lithuanian Bank and commercial banks and their implementation, 
and the supervision and auditing of Lithuanian banks. We would 
like to see more favorable changes in privatization. 
Undoubtedly, the system of taxes and their collection must be 
considerably upgraded. 
  [ELTA] When can the IMF suspend its assistance to 
Lithuania? 
  [Cornelius] All changes in the Lithuanian economy are 
observed according to requirements that are set for each year 
and its quarter. This is the requirement to possess a certain 
amount of hard currency in the Lithuanian Bank, to repay foreign 
debts by fixed deadlines, and to settle the fiscal deficit. 
Lithuania is not allowed to possess a so-called growing debt to 
foreign countries. 
  If these requirements were not satisfied, it is very 
unlikely 
that the IMF would continue its loans according to the 
Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, because the IMF Executive 
Council reviews and assesses a country's economic situation 
before every payment. However, there is no such threat to 
Lithuania. 
  [ELTA] The Lithuanian Government is sometimes 
reprimanded for executing the principles of the economic policy 
memorandum dictated by the IMF too blindly.... 
  [Cornelius] I would like to stress that this is a program of 
the Lithuanian Government rather than of the IMF economic 
reform. We only assessed the economic situation in Lithuania and 
proposed the IMF Executive Council to back such economic reform. 
The fund has pledged to extend resources that would help to 
implement the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, because the 
Executive Council has noticed great economic progress and 
successful reform in Lithuania. Therefore, the fear that 
Lithuania is fulfilling the IMF requirements alone is unfounded.

  [Text] Bishkek, 4 May -- A meeting on settling the 
Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh opened today at 
Kyrgyzstan's government house. President Askar Akayev addressed 
those present: 
  The Karabakh conflict is a complex knot of problems that has 
centuries old traditions. Generations of people of the two 
fraternal republics should not be victims of historic mistakes 
and contradictions. It is our belief that these problems should 
be solved today on the basis of present day realities, on the 
principles of tolerance and mutual concessions. The fact that 
the Karabakh problem is being discussed within the framework of 
the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, which is led by the 
Vladimir Shumeyko, allows us to believe that Legislative 
Branches of power will find a safe mechanism for putting out the 
flame of the fraternal war. There are no winners in this war. 
Your efforts aimed at peaceful settlment of the Karabakh 
conflict will be appreciated by future generations and by 
history. I wish you success in your job, peace and well being 
to your people. 
  [Signed] President Askar Akayev.

  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- A second stage of signing an 
agreement on civic accord will be held in the Kremlin today. 
The document will be signed by representatives of industrial, 
banking and entrepreneurial associations, president's chief of

  [Text] Leaders of the Agrarian Party and its parliamentary 
faction, the Agrarian Union and the Agricultural Trade Union 
Central Committee will meet in Moscow on May 10 in order to 
examine and to weigh up once again the agreement on agricultural 
policy guidelines for the next two years. The agreement has 
recently been signed with the Russian government. Afterwards, 
the Agrarians will make their final decision whether or not to 
sign the treaty on civil accord. This was announced by Deputy 
Chairman of the Agrarian Union, Gennadiy Kulik. The union 
includes Russia's biggest agricultural enterprises. 
  Kulik suggested that this meeting was needed since none of 
the signatories had as yet seen the final text of the document. 
That is why the Agrarian Party, the Agrarian Union and the 
Agricultural Trade Union wanted to make sure if the government 
had accepted all their demands. 
  In particular, the Agrarians insisted that the government 
included into the treaty a number of obligations in order to 
prevent forceful pressure on farmers when choosing forms of 
property, to ensure Russia's independence in food supply and to 
support the agricultural regions with 10 or 15 percent of the 
budget expenses. Several other conditions have also been put 
forward. 
  The agreement was signed on April 30 on the day after the 
ceremony of signing of the treaty on civil accord in the 
Kremlin. The Agrarian leaders did not take part in the ceremony.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz May 4 TASS -- "The provisions of the 
social concord agreement, signed in the Kremlin on April 28, 
must serve as guidelines for talks between the presidents and 
official delegations of North Ossetia and Ingushetia," North 
Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov said here today, addressing 
leaders of North Ossetian art unions, rectors of higher 
educational establishments, and representatives of the 
republic's national cultural centres. 
  The North Ossetian leader went on record for the 
continuation 
of the dialogue with the Ingush side, but bluntly rejected the 
idea of a moratorium on border changes. In his opinion, it is 
necessary to completely delete from the agenda the question of 
recarving the borders of the North Caucasian area, because this 
may provoke a new tragedy in the region. 
  The North Ossetian president dwelt at length on the 
forthcoming celebration of the 220th anniversary of Ossetia's 
accession to Russia and the 210th anniversary of the foundation 
of the city of Vladikavkaz. The jubilee celebrations, devoted 
to these dates, will be held from October 7 to October 15. 
Galazov said that these dates "have not lost their importance 
at all, but are assuming a new historical meaning in the light 
of modern political problems".

<F P=106> [Andrey Aderekhin report: "Better Not To Travel to the </F>
Kuban Without Invitation Now"] 
  [Text] Krasnodar Kray -- The Krasnodar Kray Administration 
has adopted a series of documents imposing severe restrictions 
on opportunities for newcomers to obtain permanent residence 
permits, as well as on temporary stays in the Kuban for foreign 
citizens and persons without citizenship. These restrictions do 
not affect Russians. 
  According to some estimates there are now about 600,000 
immigrants in the Kuban -- mainly from interethnic conflict 
zones. Only a fraction of them are registered in the kray and 
have residence permits. The kray administration head's decree 
says that the multinational stream of immigrants is posing a 
serious threat to social and political stability. 
  This new state of affairs significantly restricts the 
categories of people who can obtain the right to permanent 
residence. For example, Krasnodar Kray Immigration Service is 
being instructed to grant the status of refugee or enforced 
migrant only to those who have close relatives in the Kuban who 
have already been living here more than five years. These same 
persons can register as residents of Sochi only in exceptional 
circumstances. 
  Citizens from the former USSR and persons without 
citizenship 
now must have invitations, which are officially registered by 
the organs of local self-government, in order to enter the kray 
on a temporary basis. Moreover, they have to apply to the 
internal affairs organs within 24 hours of their arrival for 
registration. A one-shot fee of 20 percent of the minimum 
monthly wage has been imposed for the invitations' official 
registration. Those who are involved in entrepreneurial or 
other profit-making activities will have to pay the same amount, 
but in their case it will be payable for each day they spend in 
the Kuban. People visiting close relatives, invalids, students, 
entertainers, workers on tours of duty, and several other 
categories of arrivals are exempt from the registration fee. 
  The Caucasus Special Border District's "Krasnodar" 
operations 
section of troops has been advised to hand over those who arrive 
in the Kuban without invitations drawn up in the prescribed 
manner to the Federal Counterintelligence Service or 
representatives of the internal affairs organs in the location 
where they were allowed to cross the Russian Federation state 
border. 
  True, a blunder has been made. The administration head's 
decree mentions that the decree will come into force the moment 
it is published. However, a large number of the kray's 
inhabitants who are awaiting guests from the former USSR have 
only just found out about the necessity for them to have an 
officially registered invitation for a temporary visit.

  [Text] Russia is Kyrgyzstan's major partner and its 
strategic ally, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev declared during 
his meeting with Chairman of Russia's Federation Council 
Vladimir Shumeyko on Wednesday [4 May] in Bishkek. 
  In the course of their conversation Akayev pointed out that 
Kyrgyzstan and Russia maintain traditional friendly and 
partnership relations. However, in his opinion, there are 
several problems in the republic related to migration of the 
Russian-speaking population. 
  Akayev underlined, that Kyrgyzstan does its utmost to solve 
this problem. In his words, it needs Russia's assistance. He 
indicated that the Slavic University formed in Bishkek in which 
the Republic's Russian-speaking population can receive an 
education represents "one of the examples of the 
Russian-speaking population's strengthening." 
  As Akayev said, it is necessary to create other institutes 
and organizations so as to lower the level of Russian migration 
from Kyrgyzstan. He also pointed out that in the near term the 
Republic's government would adopt a state program in order to 
keep its Russian-speaking population from leaving. 
  Shumeyko underlined that Russia is ready to render economic 
assistance to Kyrgyzstan, in particular, "to support the 
Republic's regions, which have suffered from natural disasters."

power engineering firms and companies from a number of countries 
discussed a broad range of problems concerning power saving, 
power engineering, heating supplies, electrical systems and 
networks, alternative energy sources and prospecting for fuel 
deposits. 
  The results of the forum exceeded our expectations, said 
Sepukh Tashchyan, Armenian state minister. Speaking at a news 
conference here today, he said 30 proposals had been received 
from various foreign firms which, with serious development and 
financing, could produce good results. 
  Susan Olds, director of the Caucasus regional section of the 
U.S. International Development Agency, said the U.S. Government 
was prepared to grant Armenia $26 million in aid to be spent on 
the development of energy saving and raising the efficiency of 
power usage, on the development of hydro-power, alternative and 
renewable sources of energy. The European Union is giving 
Armenia a certain amount of aid. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton regards as very important the 
process of democratization in the former republics of the USSR, 
stated Richard Williamson, representative of the U.S. Department 
of Energy. Therefore, he said, the U.S. Government supports and 
encourages the activities of those firms that may be useful to 
Armenia in carrying out reforms, in implementing the course of 
democratization. Armenia has all the technical and intellectual 
potential for our further cooperation in the sphere of power 
engineering, the U.S. representative stressed.

<F P=106> ["Text" of State Adviser Qabil Guseynli's assessment of </F>
President Clinton's letter to President Aliyev on U.S. aid to 
Azerbaijan -- recorded] 
  [Text] Political circles have focused much attention on 
President Bill Clinton's letter to President Geydar Aliyev. The 
letter contained specific suggestions for trying to establish 
the new diplomatic approaches that are required for improvement 
in the relations between the United States and Azerbaijan. 
  The question of humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan must be 
emphasized at this point. It will be recalled that the U.S. 
Congress adopted a resolution to enable the U.S. Administration 
to provide humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan when the former 
government was in power in our republic with a view to 
supporting Azerbaijan's independence. The resolution applied 
only to Azerbaijan among the former Soviet republics. It 
worried Armenia at the time. I wish to take note of several 
facts. The number of refugees in Azerbaijan totalled 120,000 
when the resolution was adopted. However, that number has 
increased to more than 1 million at the present time. That 
shows that the humanitarian aid Armenia has received when 
Azerbaijan was deprived of that right has contributed toward the 
further broadening of that republic's aggression. 
  I also wish to stress that the U.S. political circles, 
President Clinton in particular, are well aware of that state of 
affairs. It has been observed that President Clinton's stand on 
the maintenance of the embargo on Azerbaijan has significantly 
changed since October 1993. The letter he conveyed to President 
Aliyev, in which he mentioned that he personally supports the 
lifting of the embargo, indicated that President Clinton's stand 
on the matter has significantly changed and that he intends to 
influence the Congress. 
  In addition, I wish to recall a point that was mentioned in 
President Clinton's letter. He stressed that the commencement 
of the peace process on Daghlyk Karabakh within the CSCE 
framework will facilitate humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan. That 
was an indication that the United States wishes to contribute 
toward the peace process in the region and give every kind of 
support for the peaceful progress of social and political 
changes in Azerbaijan. That, however, requires serious work by 
Azerbaijan's diplomats.

ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shelenkov] 
  [Text] Cairo, 4 May -- The Russian-U.S. cosponsorship of 
the search for a Middle East settlement has passed a stern test. 
The heads of the two countries' diplomatic departments spent 
two days in the Egyptian capital making strenuous mediating 
efforts to bring to a successful finale the talks between the 
Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel, which were crowned 
today by the conclusion of an historic "peace protocol." Even 
during the actual signing ceremony, the intermediaries had to 
come urgently to the assistance of the sides. 
  Several details of the dramatic episode, which almost 
obliterated the many months of the "peace marathon," have become 
known to ITAR-TASS correspondents from informed sources. As he 
appended his signature to the agreement, Yasir 'Arafat demanded 
from the United States and Russia additional security guarantees 
for the territories now being freed. During an enforced break 
in the signing procedure, the cosponsors gave him the relevant 
assurances, which insured the Palestinian leader's agreement to 
sign the document. Experts from the two great powers started 
consultations on the matter today, and the guarantees are 
expected to be countersigned tomorrow by the Russian and U.S. 
heads of diplomacy.

  [Text] Cairo May 4 TASS -- Russia is interested in 
stability in the Middle East which is located in geographical 
proximity to its borders, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said in Cairo on Wednesday. 
  Kozyrev attended the ceremony of signing a peace accord 
between Israel and the PLO to implement limited Palestinian 
self-rule. 
  "It is the proof of our closeness that it takes four hours 
to 
fly from Moscow to the Middle East and twice as much to the 
Russian borders," he said. 
  "I am convinced that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are well aware of Russia's 
adherence to regional settlement as one of the co-sponsors of 
the peace process," Kozyrev continued. 
  He pointed up three key aspects in the Middle East peace 
process. The first one is Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip 
and the town of Jericho. The second one is peaceful 
co-existence and mutual respect between Israel and Palestinians 
and "probably even cooperation between them in the future." And 
lastly, comprehensive settlement in the region. 
  "We hope that it will be reached in the not so distant 
future 
and we will witness the signing of an agreement on not only the 
Gaza Strip and the town of Jericho, but also other territories," 
the Russian foreign minister added. 
  Kozyrev praised the "outstanding role" of Egyptian President 
Husni Mubarak in furthering the peace process in the region.

  [Text] There is dangerous brinkmanship in Bosnia today. In 
this situation, the key world community members should take 
energetic steps and exert pressure to prevent war and restore 
peace there, the Russian President's Special Envoy Vitaliy 
Churkin, a deputy foreign minister, declared in an interview 
with Interfax on Wednesday. 
  In his words, pressure should be applied to both sides, the 
Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Moslems. "There is a war of 
nerves going on at Brcko, a confrontation that, in principle, 
could result in a military clash. That is why energetic actions 
and pressure are essential. What this really means is that the 
sides should sign an agreement that would end hostilities, 
disengage the troops, and would enable the UN to deploy its 
protection force in former Yugoslavia between the two hostile 
factions," Churkin said. 
  In his words, Russia's proposal to convene a conference on 
Bosnia with Russia's foreign minister, US Secretary of State, EC 
and UN representatives to take part aims at putting pressure on 
the belligerents. 
  Asked when and where such a gathering could take place, 
Churkin replied, "That may be known shortly. The issue has been 
discussed by the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his 
American counterpart Warren Christopher upon their arrival in 
Cairo to attend a ceremony for signing Israeli-Palestinian 
accords on Gaza and Jericho."

Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 5 May TASS -- The press service of the 
Ukrainian Defence Ministry alleges that Russia is making plans 
to hijack the TU-22 missile-carrying aircraft from two Air Force 
regiments of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  A statement issued by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry says 
that the hijacking is planned to be carried out during next 
training exercises of the Black Sea Fleet Air Force. Commanders 
of the Second Naval Missile-Carrying Aircraft Division of the 
Black Sea Fleet Air Force are allegedly "making secret 
preparations for the operation," the press service said. 
  The press service declared that "any attempts to remove 
military hardware and other material values beyond the Ukrainian 
borders are illegal and will inevitably worsen the situation 
around the problem of the division of the Black Sea Fleet."

  [Text] On Wednesday the Latvian government took over the 
new unfinished facility of the Russian radar station in the 
village of Skrunda 160 km southwest of Riga. 
  The act of reception was signed by the Latvian Prime 
Minister 
Valdis Birkavs. After the signing ceremony he said at a 
briefing that the dismantling of the station's new facility may 
be started immediately. He said the government intends to 
announce a tender among firms for the dismantling of the 
facility. 
  Under the Russian-Latvian agreement signed in Moscow on 
Saturday within the framework of a package of agreements on the 
withdrawal of troops from Latvia, the Skrunda station will 
function for the next four years. Then it is to be fully 
dismantled within 1.5 years. The Latvian government received 
guarantees that the U.S. government would grant $2 million and 
the Swedish government - another $1 million to finance the 
dismantling. 
  The radar station was built in 1967 for missile attack early 
warning. The construction of the new facility of the station 
started at the end of 1980s.

  [Text] Moscow, April 26, RIA -- "We are carrying with us 
new ideas as to how feed and intensify the political direction 
of Bosnian settlement," Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in 
an exclusive interview before his flight to Geneva to discuss 
Yugoslav problems with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  "The military tendency is now looming quite distinctly due 
to 
irresponsible activities of Serbian commandos, but, let us hope, 
they won't go so far as to realise their plans," said Kozyrev. 
  In his words, the Security Council is busy reviewing all the 
apsects of likely military measures on the part of NATO. "We 
have succeeded in preventing nato from having a free hand in any 
such action, it is the Security Council which is now to follow 
it very intently". Kozyrev expressed the hope that the Serbs 
will continue performing their obligations before the UN and, 
correspondingly, the UN will not be confronted with the need to 
decide on NATO strikes. "But all will depend on the Bosnian 
Serbs' conduct," stressed Kozyrev, noting that, despite the 
possibility of military measures, the right decision should be 
sought on the political plane. 
  The minister reported that he was in touch with Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic and received from him today an 
answer to his message, in which Milosevic expresses the desire 
to sustain constructive cooperation with Russia, he showed 
understanding of the Russian position. 
  In the words of Kozyrev, he was going in the next two-three 
days to meet French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and, perhaps, 
foreign ministers of a number of other Western states to discuss 
the same problems. "The next two-three days will see intensive 
diplomatic arrangements, which, as I think, should open a way 
toward the closing stage--a summit for rounding off all this 
tragic episode," said Kozyrev.

  [Text] Geneva, April 27, RIA. There is "the will and the 
opportunity" for a realistic partnership aiming to attain 
political settlement in Bosnia. Now is the time for joint 
action, said Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at a press 
conference upon the completion of his talks with Alain Juppe, 
foreign minister of France, who arrived in Geneva today. 
  Said Kozyrev in reply to a RIA question: "The main 
conclusion 
after the talks is that there is the need to unite efforts for a 
political settlement in Bosnia in order to preclude a new wave 
of violence in the region. My partners and I are optimistic: we 
believe there is a realistic opportunity to attain settlement. 
We would like to hold - in the near future - a working meet of 
foreign ministers to prepare a summit meeting with the 
participation of the UN." 
  On the possibility of new NATO strikes in the former 
Yugoslavia, the minister said that everything depended on 
specific circumstances. If there are new barbaric shellings of 
civilian targets, everything will depend on a specific 
situation. "The main thing is that we have made NATO's military 
plans not so much the plans of that organization, but the plans 
of the UN Security Council to be applied in the worst 
situation," Kozyrev noted. The procedure for the 
decision-making on the issue is well known: all operations 
should be seen as being within the framework of the UN 
Peace-keeping effort. 
  M. Juppe said that he accords "exceedingly great importance" 
to the talks with the Russian minister. He called them rather 
productive and said that they would continue soon. He plans to 
visit Moscow on May 19. 
  France has always maintained close contact with Russia on 
the 
issue of the Bosnian settlement, Juppe said. Today's talks are 
seen as very important in the light of the situation there. 
  Today, Andrey Kozyrev had a telephone conversation with UN 
Secretary General's Envoy Yakusi Akashi. The two officials 
noted the normalisation of the situation around Gorazde, which 
lays the ground for the processes of a peaceful settlement in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

  [Text] Geneva, April 27, RIA -- Vitaliy Churkin, special 
representative of the Russian president in former Yugoslavia, 
will no longer "actively participate" in Bosnian settlement. 
This high-ranking Russian diplomat told newsmen today that his 
place in the contact group established to step up UN peacemaking 
efforts in Bosnia will be occupied by Aleksey Nikiforov who has 
"direct experience" of work in former Yugoslavia. The new 
contact group, which comprises Russian, American, French, 
German, and british officials, heads for Sarajevo April 28. 
"I'll maintain links with it and, probably take part in its work 
from time to time" said Mr. Churkin. But he is going to focus 
his efforts on Russia's possible affiliation to NATO's 
partnership in the name of peace program. 
  Western diplomats watching developments in former Yugoslavia 
do not rule out that Mr. Churkin's departure at such a 
responsible moment may be connected with his recent harsh 
statements regarding the Bosnian Serbians who angered them very 
much.

  [Text] Bishkek, May 4, RIA -- Russia will continue aiding 
Kyrgyzstan in its effort to make up for the harm done by natural 
disasters -- earth tremors and avalanches -- which are so 
frequent in that mountainous republic, said Vladimir Shumeyko, 
who chairs the Federation Council of Russia's Federal Assembly, 
now on an official visit in Bishkek. Kyrgyzstan is the site for 
a field staff of the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations, 
which runs programmes of measures to prevent natural disasters, 
forecast them and provide early warning of tremors and 
avalanches. 
  The town of Uzgen is where a number of prefab houses, 
purchased in Russia with Russian easy-term credits, have been 
built to give shelter to victims of natural disasters. Kyrgyz 
President Askar Akayev estimates that last year Russia's aid 
helped save over 14,000 of the republic's citizens.

  [Text] Moscow, April 28, RIA -- Russia's active 
participation in all the European processes was high on the 
agenda at the inter-parliamentary seminar, "Will Europe Exist 
Without Russia?" in a RIA interview, Vice-Speaker Valentin 
Kovalev said: "The world has become one-polar, which creates 
additional problems for Russia and Europe. Russia's current role 
in the European process is obviously not in keeping with its 
potential." 
  The Russian MP [Member of Parliament] pointed to the need of 
Russia's joining all European political and economic structures. 
"The promptness with which Russia may occupy its due place in 
Europe will largely depend on the solution of internal 
problems," said Kovalev. 
  The inter-parliamentary seminar, which opened today at the 
Moscow-based Russian Academy of Sciences, was organised by 
Europarliament and the National Assembly of France. Deputies of 
the State Duma take part.

  [Text] Moscow, April 29 (CTK) -- Russia, which at the 
beginning of April was considering the possibility of offering 
Slovakia credits for the completion of the nuclear power station 
in Mochovce, West Slovakia, is now showing interest in the 
Russian Ministry of Nuclear Energy putting direct capital into 
the project, Slovak Deputy Premier Brigita Schmognerova said 
today. 
  Schmognerova arrived in Moscow yesterday with Slovak Economy 
Minister Peter Magvasi [as received; according to the referent 
item, the Slovak delegation consists of Schmognerova and Finance 
Minister Filkus] for a two-day visit. At the beginning of April 
Magvasi had given news of the possibility of credits to the 
value of $450 million. 
  Schmognerova, who has been negotiating with Russian Nuclear 
Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov, said Russia was proposing the 
creation of a joint enterprise for the completion of the first 
block of the power station in Mochovce and would be interested 
in the enterprise dealing with other blocks later. 
  Filkus and Schmognerova have also been negotiating the 
method 
for the repayment of the Russian debt to Slovakia, which after 
the division of Czechoslovakia took on debts from Moscow to the 
value of $1.6 billion. 
  Slovakia was considering further supplies of spare parts for 
the Defense Ministry as a means of repayment, and is expecting 
that during the completion of the first block of Mochovce part 
of the Russian supplies will be covered in this way, 
Schmognerova said. 
  Filkus said that he had invited his Russian counterpart 
Sergey Dubinin to visit Slovakia, and they could then agree on a 
document on the repayment of the Russian debt. This could later 
be signed in Moscow by the Slovak president or premier. At 
present, he said, there are two proposals for an agreement, both 
of which are found unacceptable for each side respectively.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Apr, JIJI -- Russian Vice Foreign 
Minister Panov (in charge of Asian Affairs) gave an interview to 
the JIJI NEWS AGENCY on 16 April. Touching on the military 
alliance included in the treaty of goodwill and mutual 
assistance which the former Soviet Union had signed with the 
DPRK (North Korea), Panov stated: "It will be reviewed taking 
various factors into consideration." He also disclosed that the 
treaty will be revised before its expiration in 1996. 
  In the interview, Vice Minister Panov stated: "North Korea 
does not have the technology for developing nuclear weapons." 
Panov stressed that North Korea's nuclear arms development 
issue should be resolved not by compulsory measures such as 
economic sanctions, but by peaceful measures such as the 
convocation of an international conference advocated by Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, April 29, RIA -- "Russia's new policy is 
based on the premise that finding new friends does not mean 
losing old chums," Ivan Rybkin, who chairs the State Duma, told 
North Korean Ambassador Son Sung-pil on April 29. The meeting 
was held at the request of the latter. 
  The ambassador spoke in favour of more dynamically 
developing 
bilateral ties to note that "certain differences in our 
countries' respective ideologies are no reason for deteriorating 
mutual relations." On the so-called nuclear issue, the 
ambassador of North Korea said that his country is ready and 
willing to deal with all controversial issues of normalisation 
in the Korean Peninsula by way of negotiation. 
  The two sides discussed prospects for bilateral cooperation, 
in particular in the economy, science and technology.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- Russia has decided to tighten law 
enforcement against poaching boats in the Sea of Okhotsk and 
other waters off the Far East, including the northern 
territories [Kuril Islands], starting on 20 April. 
  The crackdown is code named the "Fishing Season '94" 
operation, and it involves mobilization of the Border Patrol, 
local government authorities in the Far East, Russian Navy's 
Pacific Fleet, and even reconnaissance satellites. Several 
Japanese fishing boats have recently been captured in waters off 
the northern territories, and the Russian crackdown is obviously 
targeting these Japanese fishermen. 
  On 19 April, Border Patrol Commander Nikolayev stated as 
follows in Kamchatka: "As an economic major power, Russia has 
to protect its own economic interests. Our neighbors should not 
forget about it. Russia intends to establish `civilized' border 
lines -- this means the border exists to secure national 
interests." 
  The crackdown on poachers will be continued until October.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian President Boris Yeltsin by </F>
Franz-Olivier Giesbert, Pierre Bocev, and Irina de Chikoff in 
Moscow; date not given: "Boris Yeltsin: `No, the Former Empire 
Will Never Return...'"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin, a tall, broad man with a gloomy 
expression, does not strike you as naturally sociable. In his 
book On a Knife Edge which has been published by 
Albin Michel, he makes revelations with resounding frankness and 
presents a new image. But what is his political position? How 
does he see Russia's future today? He answered LE FIGARO's 
questions at the Kremlin. Sincerely, sometimes abruptly, but 
always frankly. 
  [LE FIGARO] Boris Yeltsin, despite all the rumors, despite 
everything that has been said about you, you are still there, 
loyally at your post... 
  [Yeltsin] Absolutely. I am at the helm and even more 
strongly than before the coup d'etat. 
  [LE FIGARO] How do you manage that despite all the ups and 
downs? 
  [Yeltsin] There is no recipe for being president of Russia. 
Especially because I am the first to hold this position: There 
is not yet any firmly anchored tradition. I always act in 
accordance with my view of the situation, as I feel it, in 
accordance with my character and my experience. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is your book On a Knife Edge not 
intended to give a different image of you than the one we had? 
  [Yeltsin] No. I have simply spoken about myself and 
described the events as they took place, completely frankly, 
with sincerity. I have tried, as the philosophers put it, to 
express complex matters in simple terms. It was necessary to 
write with humanity to ensure that all people could understand, 
all, the miner as well as the academician. 
  [LE FIGARO] But you do not seem to be as many people imagine 
you: We see a man who is hesitant, a man who is a prey to doubt 
and who understands his opponents. 
  [Yeltsin] That is because people did not know me very well. 
In the past I have never spoken so openly about myself. This 
time, I was very sincere. I have never tried to embellish 
myself, or to present myself as more intelligent than I am. 
That is the essential thing. 
  [LE FIGARO] You have been widely slandered in Russia but 
especially in the West as a demagogue, a chauvinist, a 
populist... Of all these accusations, which wounded you most? 
  [Yeltsin] Any unfair accusation wounds me deeply. I am very 
sensitive to this, and I find it difficult to tolerate. During 
the Congress of People's Deputies, the deputies literally mocked 
me, they criticized me to such an extent that my mother could 
not tolerate it. It killed her. You can imagine how I suffered. 
  [LE FIGARO] So, you are much more sensitive than people 
generally think... 
  [Yeltsin] Yes. Usually I am taken for a much harder man 
than I really am. But, at all events, I have never become the 
dictator which some people thought they saw in me. That is not 
what I aspire to, never. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is it possible to be president of the Russian 
Federation and have a good heart? 
  [Yeltsin] I think that the two things go well together. 
  [LE FIGARO] How do you explain the hatred which a section of 
the Western intelligentsia has toward you, the people who always 
preferred Mikhail Gorbachev and who are almost nostalgic for him? 
  [Yeltsin] Listen, I have traveled widely, but I have never 
experienced hatred from the Western intelligentsia. With regard 
to Gorbachev's good image, yes, it still exists. There is still 
nostalgia, but it is gradually being eroded. And that is 
natural. 
  [LE FIGARO] Three years after the end of the USSR is a long 
time.... 
  [Yeltsin] He paid more attention to foreign policy than to 
his people's internal problems. That is why, moreover, our 
people feel less respect for him than foreigners. 
  [LE FIGARO] In your book you write that "we are running 
out of strength... A strange feeling of emptiness gnaws at us." 
Should that not be interpreted as an admission of failure? 
  [Yeltsin] No. For 70 years, the former leaders of the 
Soviet Union had been trying to paint a rosy picture of 
everything, to embellish reality. They had accustomed the 
people to believing that nowhere else were things going better 
than in our country. I wrote the truth: There are doubts; 
among some people there is lack of confidence in the reforms, a 
pessimism that the reforms will not be carried through. But 
this is not the majority, the majority of people have confidence 
in Russia, its renaissance, its democracy, and its market 
economy. 
  [LE FIGARO] So, you do not regret having used shock 
treatment? 
  [Yeltsin] Not at all. Those who have not done so in the CIS 
countries -- Ukraine, for instance -- are now in a much more 
difficult position than Russia. I expected that. I even tried 
to persuade the other states that we were right and that they 
should follow Russia. Failing that, the former Communist Party 
nomenklatura would take us back to the past. And that was 
unacceptable. We therefore had to act quickly and resolutely. 
  [LE FIGARO] And does that nomenklatura still worry you 
today? 
  [Yeltsin] No, it is they who are worried. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you feel that you have made mistakes over the 
past three years, and if so what are they? 
  [Yeltsin] There have been mistakes, of course. I would not 
like to list them, but there have been some. However, none of 
them has been strategic in nature, they were tactical mistakes. 
At specific moments, it was possible to act differently, but 
that does not change the strategic objective. 
  [LE FIGARO] Where does the danger for Russia lie now? With 
the Communist Party? With Zhirinovskiy? The rise of 
neo-fascism? 
  [Yeltsin] The real danger is the next president. That is 
what could present a problem for Russia. 
  [LE FIGARO] So, will it be Boris Yeltsin again? 
  [Yeltsin] I will not talk about that subject. 
  [LE FIGARO] Why is the candidacy of the future president, 
for the 1996 elections, so dangerous? 
  [Yeltsin] Because no possible candidate can be seen. 
Perhaps in two years a prominent figure will emerge, a 
political leader who would be recognized by 120 million voters. 
  [LE FIGARO] So, you are planning to stay... 
  [Yeltsin] Until June 1996 of course. 
  [LE FIGARO] And after that, you will see? 
  [Yeltsin] I repeat that I will not talk about that subject. 
  [LE FIGARO] But do you not think that a man should be 
prepared for this task now? 
  [Yeltsin] It must be done. And I am personally concerned 
with this. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is Zhirinovskiy a threat? 
  [Yeltsin] No. 
  [LE FIGARO] Are the Russian people too intelligent to allow 
themselves to be taken in by demagoguery? 
  [Yeltsin] He is a man who will leave the political stage. 
He has no social base. There is no support for fascism in our 
country. Our people suffered more than any other from it in 
World War II, it lost 20 million people in it. 
  [LE FIGARO] How do you explain the gloom-mongering with 
regard to Russia? Sometimes a coup d'etat is predicted and at 
others there is talk of famine... 
  [Yeltsin] Why should I answer that. Go and look at our 
stores, they are like France now. They sell kiwi fruit! 
  [LE FIGARO] Man cannot live by kiwi fruit alone.... 
  [Yeltsin] Do you not know what a kiwi fruit is? It is fruit 
from the south. You can find anything you want in our stores. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you mean that agriculture is now functioning? 
  [Yeltsin] I mean that the market for consumer goods is 
recovering. I do not mean that it is the most well-stocked 
market in the world, but it is close to the markets which exist 
in the civilized countries. It takes a great deal of 
imagination to think of something to buy which is not in our 
stores. This was impossible two or two and one half years ago. 
The shelves were completely empty, the stores were empty. This 
is what the reform is, these are its results. 
  [LE FIGARO] So, you are optimistic, even if you think that 
it will take a lot more time? 
  [Yeltsin] I have never said that it would take a great deal 
of time. It is you who say that, not me. 
  [LE FIGARO] In the West, it is not just the collapse of 
Russia which is feared, there is a conflicting, totally 
conflicting fear: that of the return of Russian imperialism, of 
a new takeover of the CIS countries in particular. Does this 
risk exist? 
  [Yeltsin] No, no, no. The former empire will never return. 
I can absolutely guarantee that. Democracy and the empire are 
not compatible. When we sign 12 agreements and treaties, 
including a treaty of friendship with President Ulmanis of 
Latvia, is that the attitude of an empire? No, these are the 
actions of a friendly neighbor. Nothing more than that. And we 
are acting in the same way toward the others. 
  [LE FIGARO] There are nonetheless 25 million Russians living 
outside Russia's borders. Does this not present you with a 
problem? 
  [Yeltsin] Of course, this worries us. Especially when there 
are cases of discrimination against Russians. That is why, in 
Latvia's case, we are signing an agreement on pension rights for 
Russians living there and other documents relating to human 
rights, among other things. There are international rules, we 
want there to be no segregation between Latvians and Russians. 
  [LE FIGARO] We in the West sometimes find it difficult to 
understand Russia's attitude on the Bosnian issue. On the one 
hand, there is Slav solidarity with the Serbs, but at the same 
time you give the impression of having more and more difficulty 
in supporting them... 
  [Yeltsin] You are completely wrong. You are completely 
mistaken. It is surprising that you have such a view of things. 
The reverse is true. We want to end the war in Bosnia, and in 
Yugoslavia in general. I repeat: end the war. The Americans 
have greater influence over the Muslims, the Germans over the 
Croatians, and the Russians over the Serbs. Let us therefore 
work together to exert our influence to ensure that they sit 
down at the negotiating table and sign a peace agreement. It 
was I who suggested a summit meeting among Russia, the United 
States, the European Union, the United Nations, and the Yugoslav 
leaders, in a neutral European country. Let us agree that a 
peace agreement should be signed, or at least a cease-fire 
agreement. We think that our contribution is thus much more 
important than air strikes. 
  [LE FIGARO] You would like this peace agreement to be signed 
in Moscow one day... 
  [Yeltsin] Why not in Moscow... In Moscow or elsewhere, in 
any Russian city... I can also go to Geneva, to any city... 
  [LE FIGARO] In your book, you give the impression of having 
a weakness for George Bush and Helmut Kohl. Who is the 
statesman to whom you feel closest? 
  [Yeltsin] This is true of Bush. I wrote that with complete 
frankness. From our first meeting, we had good relations, we 
were sincere with each other, and we became good friends. It 
was then that we formulated our ideas on our partnership, it was 
then that we renounced the potential rivalry between our 
countries, it was then that we reached agreement no longer to 
target missiles at each other. I greatly respect his wife 
Barbara and his whole family. With regard to Helmut Kohl, we 
meet often, we talk frequently on the telephone, and I am going 
to make him an official visit in May. We have very good 
relations. Moreover, when it comes to support for the reforms 
in Russia, Germany has done more than any other country. 
  [LE FIGARO] In On a Knife Edge virtually no 
mention is made of Francois Mitterrand. Why is that? 
  [Yeltsin] I have not written a world history, or a history 
textbook. I have met with Mitterrand twice and he receives a 
corresponding number of mentions in my book. 
  [LE FIGARO] What are you going to do when you leave us? 
Play tennis? 
  [Yeltsin] No, I play on Tuesdays and Saturdays. 
  [LE FIGARO] Take a freezing cold bath? 
  [Yeltsin] Certainly. I do that every day. 
  [LE FIGARO] It is surprising to note, on reading your book, 
that the idea of death does not frighten you? 
  [Yeltsin] Absolutely not. 
  [LE FIGARO] How can this be? 
  [Yeltsin] I have never thought about it, I simply do not 
think about it. That is how it is, I was born like that. 
  [LE FIGARO] How many hours do you sleep at night? 
  [Yeltsin] Two, four, five at most. 
  [LE FIGARO] Where do you find this strength which enables 
you to rise like a Phoenix? 
  [Yeltsin] I was born like that. All my ancestors were old 
when they died, 96 or 100 years old. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you like power? Is it not that which 
stimulates you? 
  [Yeltsin] No, quite the reverse, it requires strength. Too 
much strength, you know. Power devours your energy. 
  [LE FIGARO] What does power mean to you? 
  [Yeltsin] It means devoting yourself fully to the task for 
which you have been chosen by your people. 
  [LE FIGARO] If you had not been disgraced in 1987 and ousted 
from the Politburo, would you now be Russian president? 
  [Yeltsin] I do not like to speculate.

  [Text] St. Petersburg, April 25, RIA -- Mikhail Gorbachev 
is "extremely critical" of the NATO Partnership for Peace 
programme, he said to the press on his two-day business visit to 
this city. 
  "European political processes are too dynamic and 
sophisticated to be understood and influenced even with UN help. 
It's good that the Duma is debating the situation round the 
NATO programme. Russia can't afford to stay aloof to Poland's 
and other neighbour countries' NATO membership." 
  The ex-president of the ex-USSR doesn't think the European 
destiny can be determined with the help of a former cold war 
tool -- or Europe will be in for a new split.

  [Text] Moscow, April 26, RIA -- The Russian Federation will 
pursue a policy of protecting and supporting Russians on the 
territory of the former USSR by carrying out a package of state 
programmes, which stipulate political, diplomatic, information, 
economic, social and cultural measures. This was stressed at a 
conference in Moscow, organised by the Commission on 
Citizenship, attached to the president, and the Russian Foreign 
Ministry. 
  The report of the committee chairman Abdullah Mikitayev says 
that special attention will be paid to the situation of ethnic 
Russians in Latvia and Estonia, many of whom have been denied 
citizenship. He said that he advocates the granting of the 
Russian citizenship to them, if they want it, and stressed that 
the settlement of the problem of ethnic Russians in ex-soviet 
states as soon as possible meets the interests of both Russia 
and newly-independent states.

  [Text] Moscow, April 29, RIA -- At the moment the Russian 
state-operated postal service finds itself on the brink of 
bankruptcy, says a press release issued by the State Duma of the 
Russian Federation. 
  Despite 15.9 billion roubles in subsidies received from the 
budget in 1993, the postal Workers paid 20 billion roubles in 
taxes. 
  The 1994 federal budget allocates no funds at all for the 
development and social needs of the postal services. 
  These facts were cited by Anatoliy Nazeykin, the chairman of 
the Communication Workers' Union, at a meeting with State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin on April 29. 
  Since the service is not profitable, post offices are 
closing 
down in many regions, with postal workers being dismissed. 
  Such a situation, in the view of the union leaders, may 
affect the interests of the population, disrupting the regular 
delivery of pensions and benefits and periodicals. 
  Rybkin backed the communication workers' request that the 
house should consider exempting the state-run postal services 
subsidised from the budget from value added tax and a special 
tax on services rendered to the population, as well as from 
taxes on press distribution and acceptance of international mail. 
  He also promised to speed up the examination and adoption of 
federal laws on communications and on federal postal services.

  [Text] Moscow, May 1 -- RIA correspondents report: 
  Khabarovsk. "We are for a peaceful shift to the socialist 
road," "we support the economic demands of trade unions 
expressed at trade union rallies held in the territory," "we 
voice our total disagreement with the domestic and foreign 
policies of the government and president"-- such are the major 
points of the resolution passed by the participants of a May day 
rally held in Khabarovsk today. Communists, socialists, the 
movement for social justice, a group of anarcho-syndicalists 
took part in it. 
  Most of the speakers demanded the restoration of the Soviet 
Union, social justice, effective measures to rehabilitate the 
economy. For the first time at the foot of the monument to 
Lenin anonymous hand-written leaflets appeared appealing to 
fellow countrymen, to the Army and to the administration, which 
speak of the need to fight for economic and political rights. 
  Yakutsk. About 15,000 Yakutsk residents and visitors-- an 
unprecedented number for the last few years -- took part in a 
May day demonstration and rally on the central square of the 
city. 
  A significant portion of the participants was made up of 
students, a feature also not observed for a long time. The fine 
sunny day in the capital of the republic helped the trade-union 
organisers of the rally. 
  The demonstration and rally passed off in a well-disciplined 
manner, mainly under the slogans of the struggle for a "revival 
of the workers' movement," "guarantees of full and timely 
payment of wages," against unemployment and instability. 
  After the rally concerts and mass celebrations began in the 
squares and streets of Yakutsk. 
  Krasnoyarsk. About 2,000 persons gathered together for a May 
day rally here. After hearing the anthem of the Soviet Union 
and speeches of local leaders of communist organisations, they 
marched under red flags in a column along the central street of 
the city to the Lenin monument and laid red carnations at its 
pedestal.

  [Text] Kazan, April 30, RIA -- According to Tatarstan 
President Mintimer Shaymiyev, he had negotiated with Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin after signing the public-accord 
agreement in the Kremlin. the two leaders had discussed ways of 
making the Russian-Tatarstan treaty more effective. 
  A high-brow board is to examine compliance with specific 
bilateral contractual commitments, Shaymiyev went on to say. 
  Yeltsin and I had talked about greater Tartar economic 
independence within the framework of the agreements signed, the 
republic's president added. 
  The republic gets much more from the federal budget than it 
deducts into it, Shaymiyev pointed out, adding that it had 
received a 60-billion rouble credit for the spring-time sowing 
campaign, deducting about 6 billion roubles into the Russian 
budget.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 68 of 5 May 94] </F>
  [Text] Political scientists see the Civic Accord, a 
civilian peace deal between Russia's reformists and hardliners, 
signed at a ceremony in St. George's Hall of the Grand Kremlin 
Palace on April 28, as an indication that the time of political 
violence is receding into the past. The document has been 
signed by the leaders of practically all regions and republics 
of the Russian Federation, many political parties, trade unions 
and religious denominations. Analysts expect that more 
signatures will be added to the agreement. 
  President Boris Yeltsin's chief of staff SERGEY FILATOV 
talks 
to our correspondent Vasiliy Kononenko about the difficulties 
the preparation of the accord involved. 
  Corr.: What made the Civic Accord necessary? 
  Sergey Filatov: The amnesty declared by the State Duma (the 
lower house of parliament) gave an impulse to the work on the 
document. It was obvious that the amnesty was a purely political 
move, which pursued aims that had nothing to do with 
stabilization in Russian society. We had immediate evidence 
that this was true - signs of a fresh confrontation and total 
mistrust of authority. And that came after we had got through a 
tremendous ordeal and were at last ready to adopt a new 
constitution. The president gave his first message to 
parliament, and the government announced its program. Those 
documents were expected to provide a basis for conciliation in 
order to overcome the crisis. 
  So we the presidential team started wondering if, at this 
time of constant surprises, it is possible to put an end to 
confrontation, which not only exhausts society psychologically 
but brings to naught economic reforms. It is largely for this 
reason that crime has been rampant in Russia, and foreign 
business began to be afraid to make investments into the Russian 
economy. So the president and his closer associates came to the 
conclusion that there was a need for a document on social 
conciliation in a broad sense. 
  Corr.: How did the work on the document proceed in concrete 
terms? 
  S.F.: Yeltsin set himself the aim of putting an end to 
political punchups and making the principal parties talk to each 
other. 
  At first, potential participants were chosen for such 
consultations representing political and public organizations 
that have support in various social strata. 
  It was decided to put Academician Boris Topornin - not an 
official but an influential academic - at the head of a team 
drafting the text of the document. Then it was suggested that 
round table discussions be held on some concrete aspects of 
further work. The text had to be constantly improved. Sometimes 
this led to scandals. For example, one of the State Duma 
members, without seeing the final version of the accord, accused 
its authors of playing a dirty game. 
  Corr.: What was the essence of the principal disagreements? 
  S.F.: There were three main points of difference. First of 
all, we argued about what the document was to be called, an 
agreement, a declaration, a memorandum, a charter, or an accord. 
Then there were objections because the text of the document was 
similar to that of the Russian Constitution. Then there was the 
problem of carrying out the accord and monitoring its 
implementation. 
  In the course of consultations, the sides decided to set up 
a 
conciliation commission. But now we believe that even that 
commission should be controlled by a group of top officials to 
take care of particularly grave conflicts. 
  There were probably three main causes of agitation. The 
first was the attempt of Valeriy Zorkin, former chairman of the 
Constitutional Court, to overtake the president's initiative. 
The second was the ultimatum made by Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader 
of the Communist Party, who said there could be no conciliation 
in society before the policy of reform was abandoned, the social 
system changed, and many people removed from the present 
leadership. And the third was the split in the State Duma 
during the debates on the accord. The president then held an 
urgent meeting. There was no panic: we already had a rough 
picture of the alignment of forces throughout the country. And 
on that basis we came to the conclusion: most of the influential 
movements were in favor of the accord, while the resistance on 
the part of some parties would be compensated for by support on 
the part of the trade unions. 
  I was sure nothing would go wrong at the final stage, 
because 
quite soon, after a new law on elections came out, a 
presidential election campaign would start, and Russians would 
evaluate the candidates on the basis of their attitude to the 
Civic Accord. 
<H5>  FATEYEV: CONFLICT IN OSSETIA NEEDS NEW APPROACHES </H5>
  The Ossetian-Ingush dispute may seem trivial to those who 
know the history of Russia and the USSR only superficially. 
However, even though the two nations are small, the dispute may 
threaten the unity of Russia. Interfax's Yuriy Sheyn 
interviewed VALERIY FATEYEV, 48, member of the Federation 
Council, member of its Security and Defense Committee and Deputy 
Economics Minister. He headed the Federation Council's 
commission that visited the Northern Caucasus recently. 
  Corr.: North Ossetia's President Akhsarbek Galazov said in 
parliament that the Federation Council's Northern Caucasus 
commission lacked insight into the region's problems. 
  Valeriy Fateyev: As the commission stayed in the Northern 
Caucasus we met with the leaders of three republics there, 
Galazov of Northern Ossetia, Aushev of Ingushetia and Dudayev of 
Chechnya. We had talks with representatives of interest groups, 
political parties and religious confessions. 
  We also conferred with the leadership of the provisional 
administration in the conflict area. We attended a meeting of 
the Military Council and discussed the regional problems with 
officials of the power ministries operating in the area. All 
the military and political issues were discussed. 
  We discussed ways to normalize the situation with the top 
officials and field commanders of the Industry Protection Board. 
The delegation visited a refugee camp, talked with displaced 
persons in Ingushetia, met with the families of Ossetians and 
Ingush. We wanted to know the opinion of common people who are 
victims of the conflict. For several days the delegation shared 
in the activities of the Ossetian-Ingush reconciliation 
commissions to understand the mechanism of their operation. We 
also met with the local Cossacks. I think that our commission 
has studied the situation in depth. 
  Corr.: Did you see documents that could shed light on the 
root causes of the conflict and ways to put an end to it? 
  V.F.: All field data and maps of what happened in September 
and October 1992 were made available to the commission. We 
learned about the industries, economics and finances of the 
republics, talked to experts and top official of ministries, 
obtained data on migration and destruction of homes. We studied 
press reports and testimony of witnesses. 
  Corr.: Was any information made available to your commission 
in Moscow? 
  V.F.: Unfortunately, numerous matters have not been 
clarified. Some documents were contradictory, some were in 
archives. The commission had Federation Council Vladimir 
Shumeyko sign requests to the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, Defense Ministry, the National 
Security Council and the Interior Ministry for more documents. 
  We asked for and obtained data on sales of weapons in the 
conflict area and analyzed data on the stationing and movement 
of troops during the conflict. Archives of the USSR Supreme 
Soviet since 1992 were studied. Some of the documents we 
obtained were signed by Stalin, Kalinin or Beriya. 
  True, we could not possibly obtain and analyze all the 
relevant documents. 
  Corr.: What conclusions did the commission make? 
  V.F.: In my view, the roots of the conflict are not 
territorial or ethnic or religious or historic. The most 
important issue is power, the ability or otherwise of the 
authorities to enable people of any confession, ethnic origin 
and time of stay in the area to live side by side in peace. 
  The officials who made a political evaluation of the tragedy 
had to be guided by this requirement rather than by what is 
apparent in lower echelons of authority or is in the mind of the 
common Ingush or Ossetian. The federal authorities should rise 
above specific details and tackle the overriding issues, above 
all the ability of the authorities to handle the situation. 
  The mass media described what happened in Northern Ossetia 
and Ingushetia variously as genocide, ethnic cleansing, war and 
conflict. The central authority cannot rely on such 
definitions. Human rights must be the overriding consideration 
and so the central authority should concentrate on what should 
be done to have life in the area return to normal rather than on 
what happened there. Incidentally, it is still happening because 
houses are destroyed, people killed, hostages taken and acts of 
terror committed. 
  The federal authorities should not evaluate the situation by 
the number of people killed. If 1000 were killed at the peak of 
the conflict and then as few as 10 died monthly, the central 
government should not close its eyes on the killings, otherwise 
one could believe that the death of one person is a tragedy and 
of tens of people is statistics. 
  Corr.: What is the situation in the region now? 
  V.F.: I am saying that the authorities of Northern Ossetia 
continuously violate human rights and are in breach of law and 
order. This is the briefest possible description of what is 
going on there. 
  You will have remembered that the conflict flared up and 
developed within Northern Ossetia and acts of violence were 
committed against its population. As a result ethnic Ingush 
population had to leave their homes. Now it is essential that 
they return. That's the long and the short of it. 
  The issue is, however, being made unduly complicated. In 
particular, the Ingush Republic is being dragged into the talks. 
But it did not even exist at the time when the conflict erupted 
and the Ingush had to flee Northern Ossetia (IF Note: It was 
part of the Checheno-Ingushetia). 
  Accusations are levelled at (Ingush President) Ruslan 
Aushev. 
But what has he to do with this? The problem is in Northern 
Ossetia. We have to thank Aushev for giving the shelter to the 
ethnic Ingush who fled Northern Ossetia. We can only think of 
asking him to help bring the refugees to where they used to live 
give them a three day supply of food. Everything else is up to 
Northern Ossetia, I think. 
  What kind of talks can be held? Who should talk to whom? 
The republic is Ingush but this does not imply that its leaders 
should enter talks about the return of ethnic Ingush to their 
homes in Northern Ossetia. 
  I was the head of the Smolensk Region administration (IF 
Note: in the West of European Russia) which borders on Belarus. 
If an ethnic conflict involving Belarussians [Belarusians] 
occurred there and people were forced to leave their homes, 
would I have to negotiate with my counterpart in Belarus? To me 
it sounds absurd, speaking mildly. 
  Above all, if I represent the authority throughout an area 
and not the interests of some ethnic group, I have to prevent 
any conflict. If it does happen, it is my problem. As an 
official in power I must have the refugees return, apologize to 
them and provide normal life for them. If it is short of cash, 
the region should apply to the federal government for it but 
never drag its neighbors into the matter. 
  In short, I see two causes of continuous human rights 
violations in the Northern Caucasus. The first is the inability 
of the North Ossetian authorities to provide law and order and 
peaceful coexistence of people in its territory. The second is 
inconsistency and incompetence of the federal authorities who 
are likely to make decisions for expediency, neglecting the 
interests of small nations and rely on the use of force in 
resolving conflicts. 
  Corr.: Why did some members of parliament accuse you of 
partiality? 
  V.F.: Our conclusions resulted from what we learned from the 
sources I mentioned. The conclusions could not be entirely 
impartial but the commission was as unbiased as it is humanly 
possible when it suggested remedies. We as (ethnic) Russians 
have no national or family or religious ties in that area. 
  Besides, the commission members were well-trained to discuss 
and analyze the situation and make decisions. Above all, we 
understood the danger of allowing the situation to continue as 
it is. 
  Some media accuse me of being pro-Ingush. So does North 
Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and some other political 
figures. Others think, however, that my policy is pro-Ossetian. 
My position is pro-Russian because peace in Russia will not be 
stable unless there is peace in every republic and area. 
  The accusations that Galazov levelled at me are explained by 
the fact that the commission pronounced a judgment on the 
performance of the North Ossetian authorities. His case that 
the sources of information our commission used were irrelevant 
has no leg to stand on. This is the reason why Galazov did not 
attend the parliamentary discussion of the essence of our report. 
  Corr.: When you spoke of inconsistence and incompetence of 
federal authorities, did you mean the provisional administration 
in the conflict zone. 
  V.F.: I meant the central authorities. In particular, the 
central authorities passed a decree on political and territorial 
rehabilitation of the nations that fell victims to reprisals but 
the decree provided no mechanism of carrying this through. 
Forcible movement of whole nations hundreds of kilometers away 
from their homes into another social medium was unprecedented at 
this scale. (IF Note: Stalin ordered deportation of the Ingush 
people to the Siberia and Central Asia in March 1944 because 
they allegedly collaborated with the Nazi troops who never 
entered Ingushetia. It was not until 1957 when the Ingush were 
allowed to return home. By that time the borders of North 
Caucasian republics were not what they had been before the 
deportation). 
  Corr.: The Federation Council will not meet until the end of 
May. Do you think its work was effective. 
  V.F.: I will speak of its effectiveness only in the matter 
we 
have talked about. 
  Last January the Federation Council receives a presidential 
decree ordering another extension of the emergency rule in the 
Northern Caucasus. The upper house decides - rightly, I think - 
that it cannot rubber stamp decrees, especially so because 
emergency has been in place for nearly 18 months without any 
tangible results and the refugees have not returned home. 
  Because the Federation Council had never dealt with the 
conflict, its deputies thought that they could impartially sort 
it out and help ease the tension by saying what they found. 
  A commission is set up which goes there and drafts advice on 
the situation. The time comes when a decision has to be made. 
  The upper house heard the commission but there was no voting 
on its conclusions. The council did not tell the commission to 
formulate a draft. Nor was a political judgment pronounced by 
the upper house even though it was made in my report. A 
decision was made to continue the hearings and set up a 
commission which could attend the National Security Council 
meeting where the issue will be discussed. The Federation 
Council proved to be incapable of anything better than this. 
Then its members left for home. It is after this that a 
Russian servicemen was killed and numerous hostages taken by 
both sides in the conflict. 
  The conflict was scheduled to be discussed by the National 
Security Council in March but it was not until late April that 
this happened. 
  On April 4 a decree extending the emergency rule is sent to 
the Federation Council. This document is not good at all. It 
was worded in Vladikavkaz, the North Ossetian capital, and 
signed in Moscow. 
  I told the deputies that the decree could not be approved 
because it would deprive the Russian troops of their rights and 
disable the administration. Nonetheless, the decree was 
approved in a voting by secret ballot. I think that some 
members misunderstood the situation while others voted so to 
promote their own political interests. Some probably allowed 
themselves to be talked into voting so. 
  Corr.: What steps could lead to normalization of the 
situation? 
  V.F.: I think that emergency rule should be imposed 
throughout Northern Ossetia because its authorities are 
incapable of coping the crisis. Under the emergency rule, the 
executive power in the area will be vested in central 
authorities and their representative bodies in Northern Ossetia 
while the Northern Ossetian legislature will be suspended. 
  IF Note: The Federation Council has recently approved a 
presidential decree placing a few more settlements in Northern 
Ossetia under emergency rule. The Russian prime minister has 
signed an ordinance extending the powers of the provisional 
administration head in some areas of Ossetia and Ingushetia. 
Our commission also suggested helping the new Ingush republic 
in the setting up of bodies of authorities. They should not be 
built along the group, clan or family lines but should include 
capable local people and knowledgeable financiers, economists 
and lawyers from the Russian Federation. These people should 
not go there as exiles or for a brief stay there but must have 
solid social guarantees and have homes there so that they could 
bring their families with them and make a good job of helping 
Ingushetia. If they decide to stay in Ingushetia, so much 
better for that republic and the whole of Russia. If they 
return to ethnic Russian areas, the country will still benefit 
from their stay in Ingushetia because they will become more 
experienced experts. This kind of training was used in the 
former USSR and was not so bad. We need such people in 
ministerial positions rather than the yesterday's pseudo- 
democratic demagogues. 
  Furthermore, I think that the Federation Council must set up 
a standing commission to monitor the situation in the conflict 
zone. 
  Finally, Moscow must start talks with the Chechen Republic 
immediately. 
  These are the conclusions and proposals the commission made 
after it had seen the situation first hand.

<F P=106> [Reports by David Hearst in Moscow, Anna Tomforde in Bonn; </F>
"Ukraine Fails Nuclear Safety Test"] 
  [Text] Ukraine is bracing itself for what is expected to 
be a damning report on nuclear safety after two accidents at 
Chernobyl's remaining reactors during a visit by an 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team. 
  The accidents, though relatively minor, will add to concern 
about nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union, where it has 
been compromised by ancient equipment, an exodus of staff and 
the smuggling of dangerous materials. 
  In Germany yesterday, a spokesman for the federal criminal 
office in Wiesbaden said there had been a sharp increase in the 
illegal trading of radioactive material from eastern Europe, on 
a black market dominated by Russians, Poles and Czechs. 
  The spokesman said nearly 200 cases of nuclear smuggling had 
been registered in 1992 -- about two-thirds involving eastern 
European suspects. The figure was certain to rise in 1993, and 
in some cases, he said, there had been indications of a 
"background of organised crime". 
  In Monday's accident at Chernobyl, an alarm was set off in 
reactor unit three, which was triggered by falling water levels. 
A cable short-circuited as officials tried to reconnect the 
reactor to the grid after two weeks of maintenance. 
  On Tuesday, a robotic arm failed while moving nuclear fuel 
rods in the oldest reactor unit, number one. The failure sent a 
container banging into an adjacent installation. Although these 
were minor incidents, the first rating one on the international 
scale of nuclear incidents, they scarcely enhance international 
confidence in the running of the plant. 
  "It could emotionally influence the inspectors who were 
there," Tatiana Yagish, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian nuclear 
authority, said. 
  The IAEA has already declared the plant, and reactor number 
one in particular, to be unsafe to operate, and the United 
States has demanded the plant's closure. Ukraine signed an 
agreement with the US to shut down the plant once it found an 
alternative energy source, but Ukraine's parliament reversed the 
decision on the grounds that they were becoming too dependent on 
expensive Russian fuel. 
  The problem of safety has been compounded by an exodus of 
qualified staff to Russia. Most were trained in Russia, and 
many are ethnic Russians. Wage levels in the Russian nuclear 
industry are three to four times higher than in Ukraine. 
Chernobyl itself, the site of many incidents since the 
catastrophe affecting reactor number four in 1986, has a new 
director. 
  Last year, there were 175 separate incidents recorded at 
Ukraine's five nuclear power stations -- a 20 per cent increase 
on the previous year. 
  Ukraine is still struggling with the consequences of the 
1986 
disaster, which it admits has caused some 8,000 deaths, and is 
still costing about 12 per cent of the national budget. 
  The concrete casing around reactor four has developed 
serious 
cracks. Last year, Ukraine launched a competition to design and 
build an alternative, but nothing has been done. 
  The impoverishment of nuclear installations in eastern 
Europe 
is increasingly making Germany a "special attraction" to 
dealers. But there have been no indications so far that traders 
have found profitable business from buyers with Germany as an 
end destination. 
  Some of the material came to Germany aboard Russian military 
transports from Siberia, and was "stored" in former Soviet 
military installations in eastern Germany before being offered 
to potential buyers. German middle men were cooperating with 
what was described as a "Russian-Polish nuclear cartel". 
  Radioactive material suitable for the construction of 
nuclear 
bombs has so far not been confiscated, the police authorities 
said. But the smuggling of uranium, and non-nuclear substances, 
such as scandium and red mercury, none the less posed a 
"considerable danger" to both dealers and the public.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Tajik "Islamic opposition leader" </F>
Akbar Turadzhonzoda by Rodrigo Fernandez in Moscow; date not 
given: "Akbar Turadzhonzoda: `Regime Survives Only Through 
Russian Support'"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- A civil war has been under way in 
Tajikistan -- a central Asian country of strategic importance to 
Russia -- for almost two years now. According to information 
from KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, the Russian Army newspaper, the opposition 
has almost 15,000 men under arms. This month the first step was 
taken toward a solution of the conflict, when representatives of 
the opposition and the government were persuaded to sit down to 
negotiate. 
  Akbar Turadzhonzoda, who lives in Iran, did not attend the 
talks, but he has had meetings with senior Russian diplomats and 
ministers. Turadzhonzoda received EL PAIS in a building 
belonging to the Foreign Ministry, guarded by soldiers of the 
Russian Army -- the same army that is fighting his own men in 
Tajikistan. 
  "The present regime is illegitimate, because it acceded to 
power thanks to the intervention of other countries (that is, 
Russia -- EL PAIS editor's note), and not as the result of a 
democratic election. This government survives only thanks to 
Russia's military and economic support," Turadzhonzoda said. 
However, he gave assurances that the opposition respects 
Russian interests in Tajikistan. 
  The Muslim leader is in favor of a peaceful solution. To 
this end the present government must resign and be replaced by a 
government of national reconciliation, "comprising neutral and 
competent individuals." The return of the thousands of Tajiks 
who fled the country because of the civil war must be 
guaranteed, and free and democratic elections must be held. 
  "We reject all proposals leading to coexistence with the 
present regime. There has been too much bloodshed and too much 
hatred. Everything depends on Russia. The Russians defend the 
borders, help to maintain internal order, and provide economic 
support. Russia must put pressure on the present government. 
If it does not do so, we will sink further and further into 
this dirty war, which can only end in one way -- with a shameful 
withdrawal, as happened in Afghanistan," he explained. 
  The opposition's proposal, its leader said, would permit 
Russia to protect its interests "at less expense" and at the 
same time "to improve its relations with all parts of the Tajik 
people." 
  The opposition is willing to disarm, but demands that this 
be 
done also by "all government structures, apart from the police." 
The functions of these structures will be taken over by peace- 
keeping forces, "comprising troops from other CIS countries." 
Russian officialdom in Tajikistan -- which has combated the 
opposition -- must be replaced. 
  Turadzhonzoda said that he understands "the anxiety on the 
part of Russia and the Central Asian republics concerning our 
possible responses in the event of our winning the free 
elections that must be held after a two-year transition period." 
The Muslim leader was of course referring to "the bugbear with 
which they frighten themselves and others -- Islamic 
fundamentalism." 
  In order to dispel these fears, Turadzhonzoda says he is 
willing to negotiate certain basic articles of the future 
constitution that will define the "nonconfessional and 
democratic character of the Tajik state." 
  The opposition leader is also aware of the importance of the 
uranium deposits in Tajikistan and says that Russia will have 
priority in exploiting them. "I stress that no country of the 
West or of the Islamic world can take Russia's place at 
present," Turadzhonzoda said. 
  "We are not demanding the withdrawal of the Russian Army, 
because that would be a disaster. There are too many enmities 
among the Tajiks, and the experience of Afghanistan frightens 
us. If Russia leaves, it will support part of the population, 
and the other part will be supported by Uzbekistan -- there are 
over a million Uzbeks in Tajikistan. As a result, we could lose 
our country and suffer a national tragedy in which the Tajiks 
will kill one another," he concluded.

  [Text] Yerevan ("Yerkir", "Lragir" dailies), 04/23/94 -- 
Russian State Duma discussed the problem of condemning the 
Genocide of Armenians during its session on April 22. Different 
fractions of Duma had prepared corresponding declarations. 
Nevertheless, in spite of strong pressure on Duma by the Turkish 
Ambassador in Russia and the Turkish Defense Minister, who is 
currently in Moscow, no polemics were made. 
  Duma's Liberal-democratic fraction presented a project of 
declaration, condemning the genocide of Armenians, which was 
previously prepared by the "Fund of Russian-Armenian 
collaboration" organization. Duma accepted this declaration, 
and its deputies have raised in memory of the victims of 
Genocide with one minute of silence. 
  Nevertheless, Duma, as a legal body, continues the 
discussion of the presented bill. 
  The following declaration was accepted by the Russian State 
Duma on April 2: 
  "20th century has been marked by great winnings of human 
spirit and good will. Nevertheless, it will also remain in 
history as a period of world war disasters, dictatorships and 
disgusting crimes against humanity. 
  The first evidences of the Genocide were massacres and 
deportations of Armenians in the Osman Empire in 1915-16. More 
than one million people were killed, causing a terrific loss to 
the world family of nations. 
  We feel deep and eternal sorrow for the victims, for all 
poets and craftsmen, peasants and painters, regardless of their 
nationality or faith, who were not born [because of the 
Genocide]. 
  On the eve of 79th anniversary of this tragedy, Russian 
State Duma condemns the genocide of Armenians and declares deep 
condolences to Armenian people, grieving with all descendants of 
the Genocide, living in Russia and all around the world. The 
memory of victims and our conscience will permanently bother us, 
as an evidence of the epoch which didn't pass in vain". 
  Similar declarations were made by two major fractions of 
Duma - the Liberal-Democratic party and the "Russian Choice" 
union.

  [Text] YEREVAN ("Lragir", "Azg" dailies), 04/23/94 -- 
Shutting down the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP) has been 
considered as the only correct decision for quite a long period 
of time. Only later, gradually, the idea of reopening the plant 
arouse again. 
  RA [Republic of Armenia] Vice Prime Minister Vigen 
Chitechyan declared during a press conference yesterday, the 
decision of reopening the nuclear power plant is not subject for 
further revisions and the reconstruction will be finished by the 
end of the year. About 70-100 million US dollars are necessary 
for implementation of the project, the majority of this money 
being the price of nuclear fuel. RA government is currently 
carrying negotiations with the government of Russian Federation 
on purchasing the necessary fuel. Project's first stage is to 
operate the plant at the planned level of operation. Only then 
the security operations are to be carried out. Only second, 
newer, reactor is currently being prepared for reconstruction. 
ANPP Chief Engineer Gagik Markosyan said, reconstruction of the 
two reactors simultaneously is neither physically nor 
economically possible in the current stage. Reconstruction work 
is actively implemented. 
  Meanwhile "Azg" reports, not all questions were clarified 
during the press conference. Particularly, concrete date when 
the plant will start producing electricity was not mentioned. 
Mr. Chitechyan reported that preparation work is finished, and 
special programs are now being devised based on the conclusions 
of Russian specialists. 
  "We produced 755 MGWt/h of electricity on April 21; this 
figure would increase by another 400 MGWt/h in case plant's one 
reactor is reopened", Vice Prime Minister said.

  [Text] Yerevan ("RESPUBLICA ARMENIA" daily-"PRAVDA"), 
04/21/94 -- An interview with the RMK [Republic of Mountainous 
Karabakh] Minister of Foreign Affairs Arkadiy Gukasyan was 
printed in "PRAVDA"s issue from April 19: 
  -- [PRAVDA] How does Karabakh, with its population of only 
150,000 people, stand against the 7-million Azerbaijan? 
  -- [Gukasyan] Did you watch the movie "300 Spartans"? You 
will understand if you saw it. There are several factors, which 
explain the Karabakh phenomenon. First, is that we know what 
are we struggling for. We have no space to retreat, we haven't 
got another land. Every citizen of Karabakh understands he will 
have no home and no family tomorrow, if he be pusillanimous. 
And we are withstanding Azeris, who are forcefully brought to 
the front from Baku, Sumgait, Kirovabad. Personally, they do 
not need Karabakh at all, and thus they are looking for a 
convenient moment to desert. Therefore, you shouldn't ascribe 
our success to the support of Armenia. 
  -- [PRAVDA] Where do you get the weaponry from? 
  -- [Gukasyan] We are very thankful to Azerbaijan for a 
"regular supply" of weaponry. 80 percent of arms we use are 
trophies. We buy the rest. I won't specify where and who from 
do we buy it though. 
  -- [PRAVDA] Arkadiy, the officials in Moscow accept you, 
though the RMK is not officially recognized by Russia... 
  -- [Gukasyan] Let me avoid this question. If I tell you why 
they accept me, they will stop doing so. 
  -- [PRAVDA] Direct Azeri-Karabakh negotiations have started 
in Moscow last autumn. What happened to this? 
  -- [Gukasyan] Yes, I have had dialogues with the Deputy 
Chairman of the Azeri Supreme Council A. Dzhalilov. 
Unfortunately, direct negotiations stopped, after Aliyev was 
officially elected as the President of Azerbaijan. 
  -- [PRAVDA] You just returned from the CSCE negotiations in 
Prague. Did you acknowledge any progress? 
  -- [Gukasyan] To say frankly, there was only insignificant 
success. We negotiated the measures of mutual trust before a 
cease fire. 
  -- [PRAVDA] What about the cease fire itself? It was 
stipulated by the negotiations between the four sides, carried 
out in February in Russian Defense Ministry. Even the concrete 
date of March 1 has been mentioned... 
  -- [Gukasyan] The agreements were not implemented. First of 
all, because Azerbaijan wouldn't accept the Russian project on 
stationing peace-keeping forces into a disengagement zone. 
  -- [PRAVDA] Suppose, Azerbaijan accepts this plan. Are you 
ready to leave the occupied territories outside Mountainous 
Karabakh in this case? 
  -- [Gukasyan] We have no claims for Azeri lands. But we 
won't leave the occupied positions until irreversibility of the 
peace process is proved. We must make sure we won't be blocked 
again and the communications will open. Our principles are: no 
cease fire without placement of independent observers; no 
withdrawal of troops without stationing the peace-keeping forces. 
  -- [PRAVDA] Is the Republic of Mountainous Karabakh a 
democratic country? 
  -- [Gukasyan] We have all attributes of power. We have a 
Supreme Council, which was elected by people, we are preparing a 
project of the constitution. But as long as the war continues, 
all control is concentrated in the State Department of Defense, 
similarly as it was in USSR during the World War II... We even 
have collective and state farms in Karabakh. We believe, these 
forms are optimal now. 
  -- [PRAVDA] What's your currency? 
  -- [Gukasyan] We are open to all currencies: rubles, drams, 
dollars... We even don't mind against Azeri manats. 
  -- [PRAVDA] Do you still have non-Armenian population in 
Karabakh? 
  -- [Gukasyan] Yes, we have Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks, 
Jews 
-- some 7-8 thousands altogether. We should though consider the 
fact that many Russians departed, when part of Karabakh was 
controlled by Azerbaijan. 
  -- [PRAVDA] What do you think about the national-liberation 
movement of Abkhaz people? 
  -- [Gukasyan] You may consider this as a joke or seriously, 
but I had an original thought once: why not create a CUS -- a 
Commonwealth of Unrecognized States. Indeed, we have a common 
goal on the large scale: to live so that countries, which are 
willing to contain us by force, are unable to dictate their will 
to us. Surely, we sympathize for Abkhazia, Dniestr, Crimea, and 
we have corresponding contacts. We may commence a mutual 
offensive on the diplomatic front, if needed. 
  -- [PRAVDA] Do you see the future of Karabakh within 
Armenia? 
  -- [Gukasyan] I percept Karabakh as an independent country. 
But I do not exclude the possibility that Karabakh may become a 
part of Armenia.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("Golos Armenii" daily), 04/23/94 -- RMK 
[Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Arkadiy Gukasyan held a briefing yesterday, dedicated to the 
CSCE Minsk Group meeting in Prague on April 11-15. The Minister 
also spoke on the reasons why the meeting between the Armenian, 
Azeri and RMK representatives, planned to be held in Moscow on 
April 15, failed. According to Mr. Gukasyan, Azerbaijan caused 
the failure, by not accepting the Russian cease fire initiative. 
  A. Gukasyan positively evaluated Jan Eliasson's work and 
stressed that the new CSCE Chairman realistically estimates the 
opportunities and demonstrates a constructive approach to 
resolution of the Karabakh problem. If he continues working in 
a similar manner, concrete results will be possible soon. 
  The Minister stressed the importance of documents on 
increasing trust between the conflicting sides, prepared in 
Prague. The document will be signed by the CSCE High Officials 
Committee. A plan on the initial stage of introducing CSCE 
observer mission was also coordinated during the meeting in 
Prague. 
  Mr. Gukasyan stressed once again the importance of 
coordinating the Russian, CSCE and UN peace initiatives.

  [Text] Yerevan ("Lragir" daily), 04/29/94 -- Presidential 
spokesman Levon Zurabyan held a briefing and particularly 
touched the answer of the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] 
authorities on the Azeri cease fire proposal. 
  The message by the RMK authorities confirmed a cease fire 
agreement, starting 0:01am on April 29, on conditions stipulated 
by the Moscow agreement of February 18. 
  Mr. Zurabyan noted that the Azeri proposal was for a short 
term (10 days) cease fire, which would be used to "take a 
breath" in order to restart the military operations with new 
force. At the same time, the Azeri side takes no obligations by 
this cease fire, which is naturally not acceptable for 
Mountainous Karabakh. 
  It was stressed that Mountainous Karabakh will establish a 
cease fire only in case, all topics of the above mentioned 
agreement are met. 
  "Armenia completely agrees with the position of Mountainous 
Karabakh", Zurabyan said.

  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 05/04/94 -- The 
Azerbaijani mass media spread information on April 30, telling 
that Lezghin soldiers are fighting in the Karabakh Army. The 
RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] defense army headquarters 
confirmed this information, noting that indeed, 23 Lezghin 
volunteers have recently arrived to Stepanakert from Khachmach 
and Khudat districts at the north of Azerbaijan, and expressed a 
desire to fight against the Azerbaijani army. 
  The commander of the Lezghin group Hajibek said, not only 
the fortune of Armenians but also Lezghins, Talyshs and other 
national minorities, whose historical lands were joined to 
Azerbaijan by Stalin's order, is now being solved in Karabakh.

  [Text] Bishkek May 5 TASS -- Negotiations between lawmakers 
from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and representatives 
of Nagorno-Karabakh have gave no result, because the Azerbaijani 
party refused to sign the final protocol on Thursday. [sentence 
as received] 
  "We worked day and night to put together the two-page 
document, but failed to reach an agreement," Vladimir Shumeyko, 
chairman of the Federation Council (Russian parliament's upper 
house), who led the Russian delegation at the talks, told 
ITAR-TASS despondingly as he walked out into a corridor inside 
the Bishkek governmental palace, where the talks were held. 
  The participants in the talks refused to talk with the 
journalists. 
  Next time, they will tackle the Nagorno-Karabakh issues in 
the St. Petersburg-based headquarters of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly. 
  They are to leave Bishkek for their home countries on 
Thursday.

  [Text] The chief Azerbaijani negotiator on Thursday refused 
to sign in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, a protocol appealing to the 
parties in the conflict over Azerbaijan's disputed enclave of 
Nagorno-Karabakh to stop fire. 
  The protocol, based on an accord signed by the Armenian, 
Azerbaijani and Russian defense ministers in Moscow on March 18, 
has been discussed by parliamentary representatives from 
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh at a two-day meeting in 
Bishkek mediated by a mission of the Interparliamentary Assembly 
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The document, 
calling for ceasefire as of midnight on May 8, has been signed 
by all other negotiators, Armenian Parliamentary Chairman Babken 
Ararktsian, Nagorno-Karabakh Parliamentary Chairman Karen 
Baburian, and the mediators, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the 
Interparliamentary Assembly and head of the upper house of the 
Russian parliament, Medetkan Medetkulov, head of Kyrgyzstan's 
parliament and leader of the Interparliamentary Assembly peace 
group for Nagorno-Karabakh, and Vladimir Kazimirov, special 
envoy of the Russian president. 
  The protocol also urged the warring sides to sign as early 
as 
possible an agreement to rule out any more hostilities and 
provide a mechanism to withdraw troops from occupied 
territories, restore communications, enable refugees to return 
home and provide a basis for further talks. 
  Azerbaijan's head negotiator, Deputy Parliamentary Chairman 
Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, told a news briefing following the talks 
that his country disagreed with some points in the protocol, 
namely the fact that it does not mention Armenia's occupation of 
Azerbaijani lands and the proposal to deploy a CIS peacekeeping 
force in the conflict zone. He also said Azerbaijan's proposal 
that a representative of Nagorno-Karabakh's Azeri community be 
added to the signatories had been rejected. "The Azerbaijani 
side is not pursuing any political ambitions but is trying to 
make proposals reflecting the real situation in the conflict 
zone," he said. 
  Shumeyko said at the briefing that it would be impossible to 
settle the conflict without recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh as a 
party to it. Azerbaijan's refusal to do so is "the main 
stumbling block," he said. No ceasefire agreement reached 
without Nagorno-Karabakh's participation would provide any 
guarantees, he said. 
  Shumeyko expressed support for the proposal to send a CIS 
peacekeeping force to the conflict zone, the embattled enclave 
being part of the Commonwealth, but said he could see no logic 
behind the idea of involving international forces in CIS to 
conflicts. 
  Armenian negotiator Ararktsian said it was "difficult to 
imagine" that the problem could be solved without the use of 
peacekeepers.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Qullu Muherremov] </F>
  [Text] Despite the conflicting media reports from Bishkek, 
it is clear that the CIS interparliamentary assembly insists at 
all costs on the recognition of Daghlyk-Karabakh 
[Nagorno-Karabakh] as one of the independent sides in this 
conflict. The elevation of the Karabakh Armenians, who at 
present have no status at all, to prominence at the Bishkek 
meeting shows that the talks are being basically conducted to 
put pressure on Azerbaijan. The course of the developments also 
shows that Armenia, which avoids heeding the CSCE mission, is 
trying to solve the problem speedily and within the CIS 
framework at every opportunity and at all costs. 
  The sudden recognition of Daghlyk-Karabakh as a conflicting 
side by Azerbaijan might place the Republic, which has been 
waging a war with Armenia for years now, in an inextricable 
position. Such a step would not only tie Azerbaijan's hands 
militarily and politically, but might also impede the proper 
understanding of the nature of this war at the international 
level. This is because at the initial stages of the problem, 
when talks were being held to put an end to war under the CSCE 
mandate, Armenia and Azerbaijan took part as sides in the 
conflict and representatives of the Armenian and Azerbaijani 
communities of Daghlyk-Karabakh participated as observers. 
  Why can Azerbaijan not recognize Daghlyk-Karabakh as an 
independent side in the conflict? Because such recognition 
would in practice mean the recognition of the existence of the 
Daghlyk-Karabakh army, regardless of Karabakh's future status. 
This could have grave consequences in the future. Also, such 
recognition on the eve of the Minsk conference would mean 
prematurely determining various parameters for the status of 
Daghlyk-Karabakh. And this will eventually entail further 
concessions. Most important, the recognition of 
Daghlyk-Karabakh as an independent side in the conflict aims at 
providing insurance for the aggressor Armenia. Naturally, the 
CIS states, primarily Russia, are only trying to shield Armenia. 
And the Azerbaijani side's resistance to that approach at 
Bishkek would most likely have a bearing on the situation on the 
front lines in the near future. However, regardless of the fact 
that the aggressor is not being identified at the present time, 
the changing atmosphere in the world will probably not allow the 
aggressor to remain in the shadows indefinitely.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Anatoliy Shapovalov: "Broken Ties </F>
Restored"] 
  [Text] Bishkek -- The talks between the parliamentarians 
of Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] and the Russian Federation in Bishkek 
have been crowned with the signing of an agreement. 
  The document, which meets international standards, contains 
11 articles. But to describe it you only have to cite one 
article: The parliaments will do everything to promote all forms 
of development of relations between the two republics. In other 
words the course elaborated by Askar Akayev and Boris Yeltsin 
has met with powerful parliamentary support. 
  To judge by the situation which has taken shape, this is a 
very noble aim. The Union has collapsed but relations between 
Kirghizia and Russia have remained. The euphoria born of the 
romance of sovereignization is abating. And with it the 
illusions that the world would greet us with open arms. In both 
Bishkek and Moscow there is a growing understanding of the fact 
that no one will be able to replace long-standing partners, 
Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian Federation Council, 
stressed when the agreement was signed. 
  The agreement lays a good basis not only for restoring 
Kirghiz-Russian relations but also for bringing them to a 
qualitatively new level. Kirghizia now, and this is no longer a 
secret, is renowned for its unique high-tech production 
facilities, for instance for the artificial growing of crystals. 
But the almost completed complexes are standing idle. To 
resolve the problem what is needed above all is capital. The 
parliamentarians suggest a way out: organizing in the first 
half of June a meeting near Moscow between Kirghiz and Russian 
entrepreneurs and bankers. Let them investigate the existing 
situation, consider the matter together, and be convinced of how 
advantageous it is to invest capital in a most unique production 
facility. Who knows, perhaps the industrialists, bankers, and 
financiers will decide to create a multinational company. 
  All these questions were the focus of attention of V. 
Shumeyko's meetings with Kirghiz President A. Akayev and Prime 
Minister A. Dzhumagulov. 
  In the opinion of M. Sherimkulov, chairman of the republic's 
Supreme Council, Kirghizia and Russia have similar political and 
economic systems. Relations built on a basis of parity are the 
model. The main thing now is to ensure that the restored 
contacts become strong. 
  The interparliamentary agreement is geared to a two-year 
period. If when this period comes to an end there has been no 
application from either side it will automatically be extended 
through the year 2000.

  [Text] Moscow May 6 ITAR-TASS -- The national press does 
not concentrate on any single subject on Friday. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI leads with a report about the signing of 
the treaty of civic peace and concord by a large group of 
representatives of the country's public organisations and 
business community. More than 100 public and entrepreneurial 
organizations and banking structures signed the treaty in St. 
Vladimir's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace on Thursday. 
  "The participation in the signing of representatives of the 
business circles signals that the nascent entrepreneurial 
community sees its interest in the stable development of society 
and is ready to shoulder its share of responsibility for 
stability," the newspaper writes. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA comments on Tajik Leader Emomali 
Rakhmonov's visit to Moscow: "There is no doubt in principle 
that Russia is ready to feed Tajikistan as long as it remains in 
the sphere of Russian influence. The time for the visit is not 
quite good: judging by all appearances, the opposition has 
finally rejected any dialogue with (Tajikistan's) government and 
is planning to settle the problem by military means. In this 
situation the powers to be in Dushanbe are forced not to discuss 
with Moscow economic problems but to plead for a further 
increase of the already sizable military assistance". 
  The same newspaper reports from the Crimea that "President 
Yuriy Meshkov (of the peninsular republic) is planning to 
address the newly-elected parliament with a package of five 
bills, which form the conceptual framework of the state and 
legal system of the peninsula. The bills, which Yuriy Meshkov 
will submit to the Crimean parliament, cover such matters as 
citizenship of the Crimean republic, its relations with Russia 
and Ukraine and reform of its executive power so as to create "a 
strong presidential republic". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Professor Valentin 
Larionov, entitled "Pluses and Minuses of Partnership for 
Peace", which says: "It is no time to demonstrate 
unpredictability in foreign policy. It looks like the period of 
excited romantic relations between Russia and the West is coming 
to an end, or probably has ended already. Time is now coming 
for mature partnership with every subsequent step carefully 
weighed at home with due consideration of all pros and cons". 
  The newspaper TRUD publishes an interview with Austrian 
Ambassador to the Russian Federation Friedrich Bauer under the 
title "Russia Must Regain Confidence in Herself". The 
ambassador says: "I think Russia's revival will begin in its 
component parts, in the provinces, in the countryside but not in 
the cities and not among the intellectuals. And it will proceed 
on the basis of a balance of interests". 
  PRAVDA carried an article by academic Valentin Koptyug who 
says that "the insane policy of privatisation has dealt a 
stunning blow to the country's national economy and continues to 
shower such blows". Koptyug says he has only one description 
for the privatisation drive underway in the country -- "A 
fantastic affair on the state level". 
  The same newspaper reports that "Karelia (Russia's 
northwestern autonomy) is looking forwards to the arrival from 
Boston, New York and other cities of America of several tens of 
high-class policemen, who, jointly with Russian militiamen, will 
patrol the streets, hunt criminals and investigate crimes from 
May 16-26. They will also teach Russians the art of using 
rubber sticks which they will give them as presents. The 
American police force that will land on Karelia will include 
experts in self-defence, preventing sexual abuse of minors, 
combatting drug-addiction and crime in schools and controlling 
infectious diseases.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Kazlowski </F>
by Yuriy Bekhterev; place and date not given: "Defense Is More 
Reliable With the Ruble"] 
  [Text] [Bekhterev] Pavel Pavlovich, you participated in 
the Moscow CIS leaders summit which discussed the improvement of 
the collective security system. This aspect of the meeting, 
however, has been kept in the background. Neither Russian nor 
Belarusian papers have provided any details on the negotiations 
and agreements signed at the summit. Is this a military secret? 
  [Kazlowski] Not everything is secret. The agreements, as 
far as I know, are not secret, and they will be made public. 
Journalists are simply more interested in economic, social, or 
national issues than in military cooperation which has recently 
become unfashionable. This is, as the saying goes, a matter of 
taste however. 
  Two packages of military issues have been discussed at the 
Moscow meeting. The first one concerns measures for stabilizing 
the situation on the Tajikistani-Afghan border and timetables, 
the number, and the tasks of the peacekeeping forces in the 
Republic of Tajikistan. 
  However, since Belarus had not signed an agreement on 
sending 
peacekeeping contingents, we did not participate in the debate 
on these issues. 
  Also signed at the meeting were a resolution on the Council 
of CIS States Defense Ministers and an agreement on cooperation 
in mobilizing the economies of CIS countries. 
  Documents from the second package were also aimed at 
strengthening the CIS collective security system. 
  These were draft declarations of members of the Treaty on 
Collective Security, draft regulations regarding procedures of 
the Collective Security Council, draft documents regulating 
activities of the council's secretariat, and draft agreement on 
its location. 
  The defense ministers initialed the drafts, but due to the 
fact that the agenda of the meeting of state and government 
leaders was very tight, documents from "the second military 
package" were not included in it. Perhaps they will be 
discussed at another meeting of state leaders, which is supposed 
to be held in early September. 
  Even though economic issues dominated the Moscow summit and 
they virtually drove back military aspects, I do not see 
anything dangerous in this. It is important today to stabilize 
the situation in industry and the agricultural sector. If this 
is accomplished, defense problems will be resolved more 
successfully. 
  [Bekhterev] Nevertheless, relations between national armies 
should also develop dynamically. Is it possible that this 
process will be slowed down, because the most important 
documents were not signed? 
  [Kazlowski] Regardless of specific results of the meeting -- 
whether specific documents were signed or not -- the work aimed 
at improving cooperation and integration between national armies 
is continuing. First of all, the pace of this work is currently 
being determined by such a strictly civil process as the 
unification of Belarusian and Russian monetary systems. If this 
process, as the saying goes, proceeds, it will also be much 
easier for servicemen to develop relations in their area. We 
also lose a lot due to the disruption of economic ties. 
  It should be enough to say that 80 percent of all Defense 
Ministry expenditures goes to Russia. This amounts to billions 
and billions of rubles. 
  This figure is astronomically high not because we waste this 
money. We purchase only essential equipment without which our 
Army would no longer be an army. The problem is that Russian 
enterprises charge us three times as much as they do at Russia's 
internal market. If there is a common ruble and economic zone, 
it will be easier for us to supply the Army, train personnel, 
and earn experience.... 
  [Bekhterev] Yet, Pavel Pavlovich, it is not a long way from 
the common ruble to a common army with Russia? 
  [Kazlowski] Nobody says that there will be any unified CIS 
armed forces. The status of our Army is defined by the 
Constitution and the policy of neutrality, which has been 
conducted by our young state. There is no need to change this. 
While the independent Belarusian state exists, it will 
definitely have its own army. 
  Another thing is that today we are unable to defend our 
sovereignty alone, either from military or political or economic 
viewpoints. Yes, Belarus is a state which proceeds toward 
neutrality, but not toward self-isolation! 
  Why should we disrupt the unified antiaircraft defense 
system 
with Russia? Without Russian radars we would end up totally 
undefended against airstrikes by modern planes and missiles. It 
is technically impossible to develop any system of early warning 
on a small territory. I do not mention using satellites without 
which efficient defense and military command is unthinkable. 
  Let us look at personnel training. To train, for example, 
pilots, it is necessary to create completely new structures, 
which would cost millions of dollars. The development of 
military science and new equipment... The list can go on and 
on. I would briefly respond to your question that Belarus needs 
a national army included in the CIS collective security system. 
The deeper the military integration the more reliable the 
defense of our state.

<F P=106> [Report attributed to BELINFORM: "We Look At the West </F>
Without Suspicion"] 
  [Text] We were moving to the European Union very slowly. 
Belarus could have become a member of this international 
organization as early as two years ago. This opinion was 
expressed by Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb, 
upon his return from Strasbourg, where he met with 
Europarliament members. The legislative speaker held a press 
conference devoted to the results of the visit. 
  Mr. Hryb said that during the meetings with the 
Europarliament members, the Belarusian delegation participated 
in a discussion about issues related to the development of 
political and economic links between our Republic and member 
states of the European Union. Examined were forms of technical 
assistance for Belarus dedicated to disarmament and liquidation 
of Chernobyl accident consequences. In the words of the 
speaker, negotiations were difficult on recognizing Belarus as a 
Republic with a transition economy, which could provide our 
country with certain economic privileges. 
  It is a pity, Mechyslaw Hryb noted, that many participants 
in 
the meetings had one-sided information and only a vague notion 
about Belarus. This resulted in their lack of trust in us, 
creating obstacles in the way of foreign investments. 
  To strengthen ties with Europarliament members and provide 
them with more information, it was decided to send a Belarusian 
ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to this 
international organization. 
  Mechyslaw Hryb said that the Belarusian delegation members 
also participated in a forum (Crance-Montana) devoted to current 
political and economic issues that was held in Bucharest. The 
forum was attended by more than 1,000 participants from 45 
countries. The Belarusian delegation head delivered a report on 
economic development at the plenary meeting. Mechyslaw Hryb 
also met with Romanian President Ion Illiescu.

"No Getting Rid of Vast `Collection' of Arms Without Help"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The National Agency for Control and 
Inspections (NACI) has officially denied reports alleging that 
Belorussia [Belarus] has suspended the elimination of military 
technology under the Treaty on Conventional Arms Reduction in 
Europe. 
  It is thought in the NACI that Belorussia would require at 
least $8 million to fully honor the obligations under the 
treaty. Belorussia's repeated appeals to Western states in this 
regard, however, have elicited no response.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikola Hrynyavitski: "Kebich Restored the </F>
Secrecy Regime Which Existed in Former Soviet Union"] 
  [Text] On 19 April, V. Kebich signed a secret Cabinet of 
Ministers resolution "On Ensuring the Secrecy Regime on the 
Territory of the Belarusian Republic." Through unofficial 
sources, SVABODA has secured a copy of this document. We quote: 
"The Cabinet of Ministers resolves that before the Supreme 
Soviet, a legal act regulating issues related to protecting 
state secrets, government institutions, organizations, and 
economic entities should comply with instructions on ensuring 
the secrecy regime in ministries, institutions, enterprises, and 
organizations of the USSR, approved by the USSR Council of 
Ministers on 12 May 1987." 
  We know that the Cabinet of Ministers tried but failed to 
draft its own instructions. It is not clear whether the reason 
was shortage of time or brains... So they decided to reinstate 
the Soviet secrecy regime, which was proven by practice. 
  According to a SVABODA correspondent, this 60-page document 
was written by Comrade Kryuchkov, former chief of the Soviet 
KGB. The document is perfect. In compliance with it, 
information on, for example, the aftermath of the Chernobyl 
disaster was kept secret.

<F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva, Aleksandr Bekker report in the </F>
"Council of Ministers" column: "The Premier Is Unhappy With the 
Ministers' Discipline. He Told Them So Without Witnesses"] 
  [Text] At yesterday's session of the Council of Ministers 
Presidium the Russian Government deemed "unsatisfactory" the 
general state of discipline in ministries and departments. 
INTERFAX, citing government sources, reported in particular 
that out of 296 presidential directives to ministries and 
departments only 156 were executed in full. As SEGODNYA's 
correspondents have learned, Premier Chernomyrdin's statement 
was couched in extremely sharp tones. This must be why 
journalists were not allowed into this session while the 
"chosen" press learned about the results of the presidium 
session from Mr. Grishin, deputy chief of the government press 
service. 
  Although one of the reasons for the premier's sharp tone was 
apparently his "grudge" against the vice premiers who had 
earlier twice disrupted the meeting, the course of the session 
shows that Viktor Chernomyrdin is in full control of the 
situation and can allow himself such a style in dealing with his 
cabinet. According to Mr. Grishin, the performance of the 
Economy Ministry, the Finance Ministry and the State Property 
Committee [Goskomimushchestvo] was criticized most toughly. 
According to some reports, emergency conferences were held in 
the latter two departments immediately following the end of the 
session. Mr. Grishin also said that the government decided to 
reprimand and reprimand severely "a number of high-ranking 
officials." Furthermore, according to SEGODNYA's sources, 
Anatoliy Chubays was advised to remove Valentin Sychkin as 
deputy head of Goskomimushchestvo, which is effectively equal to 
his dismissal. In early 1993, however, Mr. Chubays managed to 
stand up for two of his deputies: Dmitriy Vasilyev and Petr 
Mostovoy, whose resignation Viktor Chernomyrdin demanded 
immediately after his confirmation as premier. Mr. Sychkin is 
in charge of Goskomimushchestvo divisions dealing in real 
estate, including Moscow real estate. According to Mr. Grishin, 
the decision about the dismissal of other highly placed 
executives (the reference is apparently to First Deputy Economy 
Minister Andrey Shapovalyants) was postponed until their return 
from business trips abroad.

  [Text] The Thursday sitting of the Russian Government 
recognized that ministries and departments do not satisfactorily 
fulfill instructions of the Cabinet of Ministers and the 
president. This issue was being considered behind the closed 
doors. 
  The first deputy head of the cabinet's press service Valeriy 
Grishin reported to journalists that the premier sharply 
criticized federal ministries and departments "in stringent 
tones" due to the fact that they do not fulfill instructions of 
the president and the government and underlined that he "would 
not let any delays in fulfillment of instructions." 
  In Grishin's words, the worst executive discipline is within 
the Economics and Finance Ministries, and in the State Property 
Committee which have not fulfilled the greatest number of 
instructions. 
  Sources close to the Cabinet told Interfax that the 
following 
data were mentioned at the sitting: As of May 1, ministries and 
departments have completely fulfilled 156 of 296 instructions, 
six have not been fulfilled at all and the rest are on the 
preparation stage. 
  The government has recommended to release one of the deputy 
chairman of the State Property Committee from his post and two 
deputies Ministers, their names are not being voiced yet. 
  High-ranking employees, including leaders of several 
departments in the government have received severe reprimands 
and warnings.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] At a second signing ceremony in the Kremlin on 
Thursday, 141 senior Russian business executives put their 
signatures to the Civic Accord, a civil peace pact between 
Russia's reformists and hardliners. 
  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, addressing the ceremony, 
said many people in Russia were today pinning their hopes on the 
accord. "We have all witnessed the completion of an important 
stage of a nationwide endeavor to achieve social conciliation on 
the most burning and acute problems," he said. 
  "The Civic Accord meets the main task, a search for 
civilized 
methods, a comparison of various views and principles and 
conflicting ideas of how we should further develop the society 
and economy of Russia," all of which should be done without 
"political confrontation," Chernomyrdin continued. 
  He paid special attention to section two of the document, 
proposing ways to overcome the current social and economic 
crisis. Beside setting general goals, the section declares 
economic stabilization to be the shared responsibility of the 
legislative and executive branches of authority, the 
industrialists, business and trade unions, the prime minister 
said. 
  He pointed out the fact that the signatories of the accord 
included prominent bankers. Stabilization would largely depend 
on their ability to satisfy the economy's "investment hunger," 
he said. 
  Chernomyrdin said it was particularly important to provide 
normal market conditions for agriculture. But those problems 
should be tackled jointly with those who actually work in the 
fields and are building new economic relations in agriculture, 
he said. 
  "The government will keep its promise to the rural 
population: it will support their work within reasonable and 
possible limits," the premier said. 
  He said the government had also pledged to make it easier 
for 
farmers to exercise their property rights, to provide normal 
conditions for competition, and to draw up a taxation system 
that would stimulate production. 
  The country is still deep in crisis, "but we can already 
feel 
solid ground under our feet. Now we must move on. For that the 
country needs the perseverance and conscientious work of every 
member of society. We can't afford to have a flabby state," the 
prime minister said. 
  The Civic Accord had brought national conciliation nearer, 
he 
said. What is important now is to create an effective mechanism 
to make it work, for instance permanent high-level consultations 
between various governmental bodies and political and public 
organizations, Chernomyrdin said. 
  He called the Civic Accord a good remedy for the "civil war 
syndrome," in economics as well as in politics.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "New Influential Forces Accede </F>
to Accord Treaty"] 
  [Text] The widespread thesis that Russia is incapable of 
living according to civilized norms can today be considered 
repudiated. The Accord Treaty signed 28 April has given us 
reason to talk about the first signs of political stabilization 
in the country, and this process is continuing. A solemn 
ceremony involving major, influential organizations -- 
associations of industrialists, entrepreneurs, and banks -- 
acceding to the treaty was held 5 May in the Kremlin's Vladimir 
Hall. And although this time it was the premier rather than the 
president who was chairing it, and only the deputy heads of both 
chambers of parliament in the presidium, the significance of the 
event should not be belittled. 
  As V. Volkov, deputy leader of the president's 
administration, told your IZVESTIYA correspondent, the listed 
associations represent a very considerable force today, not just 
in the economic but also in the political sphere. They include 
around 120 different structures, including the Union of 
Entrepreneurs and Leaseholders, the association of commercial 
banks, and industrial groups. Members of the Public Chamber, 
representing economic structures, will also be signing. 
  Obviously, the question arises: Why have these associations 
been categorized, so to speak, as second in importance, and who 
determines who should be allowed to sign the treaty? According 
to V. Volkov, no one has set up a waiting line. At first a 
general decision was made to invite political parties and 
movements and power structures in the regions and at the federal 
level to sign. Political stability in society depends primarily 
on them. The process of acceding will subsequently be conducted 
as follows: 
  When a sufficient number of applicants to sign has been 
collected for a ceremony to be held (applications are sent in to 
the organizational section, the territorial administration of 
the president's administration, and the Public Chamber), another 
ceremony will be held in the Kremlin. Representatives of youth 
and sports associations and certain veterans organizations will 
most likely be next to sign the treaty following the current 
ceremony. They have already submitted the relevant applications. 
As for rumors of the Agrarian Party's possibly acceding to this 
document, they are unconfirmed at present. 
  How long can this process go on? What level of numbers and 
influence is acceptable for a particular organization to accede 
to the treaty? The representative of the president's 
administration was also asked these questions. He believes that 
the process will not degenerate to the point of absurdity. 
Furthermore, no one is involved in calculations about the 
influence and numbers of particular organizations, since such 
calculations would mean introducing a certain threshold of 
participation, whereas the aim has been different from the 
outset: to attract as many potential supporters of peace and 
accord in Russia as possible to the Treaty.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova and </F>
Lyudmila Yermakova] 
  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- "We, representatives of 
business circles, expect much of the treaty", President of the 
Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Arkadiy 
Volskiy said in interview with TASS on Thursday. 
  This view is shared by other participants in today's second- 
stage signing ceremony in the Kremlin, during which Russia's 
major industrialists, agrarians, entrepreneurs and bankers put 
their signatures under the treaty on social accord. 
  The main thing that prompted the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs to sign the document is 
renunciation of the use of force and any actions involving 
bloodshed, Volskiy added. He noted that so far the point at 
issue has been accord in the political sphere, but this is not 
enough for the economy. The next thing to do is to work out 
appropriate measures with a view to stop the current economic 
recession and output decline, the industrialist believes. 
"Unless we manage to pass this stage, unless we achieve 
economic accord, the treaty will become senseless", he stressed. 
  Presidential Aide Georgiy Satarov told reporters that the 
country's business community had been amply represented at 
today's signing ceremony. Their role is especially significant 
now that the crisis is being aggravated, and they may become the 
principal force to help overcome this crisis, the aide 
emphasised. He reported that the next stage of the signing 
would take place on May 12. This will not be the last stage, 
since the document is open for further signing by any 
organization concerned and interested.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- The high council of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy sent an open 
letter to the Russian president in which it grieves over the 
party's woes, calling for "urgent measures to restore justice." 
  The letter circulated today highlights the party's 
achievements and in particular, the fact that the majority of 
citizens had voted for the Constitution only thanks to active 
support given to the Constitution by the LDP. The letter 
contains complaints over the fact that "the LDP leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy had not been given the right to form a new 
government and was not even received by the president after the 
elections." 
  Among other things, the LDP high council complains that the 
leader of the victorious party was not admitted to the mass 
media, that there is not a single minister from the LDP in the 
government and that "both the party and its leader are being 
outrageously attacked and unscrupulously slandered." 
  The LDP leadership expressed "surprise" at an interview 
given 
by Boris Yeltsin to the FIGARO newspaper in which Yeltsin 
"indirectly accused the party and its leaders of advocating 
fascism."

<F P=106> [Interview with opposition politician Sergey Baburin by Yan </F>
Ulanskiy: "Sergey Baburin: We Shall Come to Power in the Fall" 
-- place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Ulanskiy] Sergey Nikolayevich, the face of those 
in power is always better seen from the opposition trenches. 
What do you think of it? 
  [Baburin] A mafia has long come to power. 
  [Ulanskiy] ??? [as published] 
  [Baburin] I didn't think this up. Everybody has been 
talking about this for more than a year. Today mafia-like 
criminal structures have unleashed an unprecedented political 
terror. They are killing deputies, torching their apartments. 
There was no such thing in the Soviet Union. The Federal 
Counterintelligence head has recently admitted the existence of 
"Betar" Zionist armed formations. 
  [Ulanskiy] Do Betar men terrorize deputies? 
  [Baburin] I didn't say that. I don't think they are 
involved. But they do exist. 
  [Ulanskiy] You spoke resolutely against the signing of the 
Treaty on Social Accord. Has your attitude to this document 
changed now? 
  [Baburin] It has not. I continue to think that it is the 
highest degree of hypocrisy to sign something behind the 
people's back. It doesn't even smack of accord so far. 
  [Ulanskiy] What guideposts would you set on the "Russian 
road" [allusion to Baburin's group] to accord? 
  [Baburin] We will come to accord one generation from now at 
best. One should not entertain any illusions here. As for 
civil peace, we must come to it immediately. Because the only 
possible alternative is war. Why do I say no accord is 
possible? What sort of accord could there be between someone 
who has been stealing and someone who has been made a pauper? 
But their differences must be resolved without butchery. 
Therefore, as the first guidepost, we should sit down and 
decide what we regard as the first priority in the area of the 
economy, which measures would rescue the economy and which enjoy 
the support of all sensible political forces. All forces that 
have influence in society. Such figures.... who have 
discredited themselves as leaders should go, owing to the 
failure of their economic and political policies. 
  There should also be accord in regard to individuals: 
someone should quit, someone should come in. And there should 
either a coalition government be formed, or it should be stated 
flatly, who is going to form a one-party government. Today we 
can see that no single party wishes to take over responsibility 
for what is going on in the country. Not a single one. In our 
parliament there are 10 factions, but I do not think you could 
find even one that would call itself the ruling faction. 
  [Ulanskiy] What about Zhirinovskiy? He constantly trumpets 
his victory in the elections. 
  [Baburin] No! He always underlines that they would come to 
power only in the fall. Like hell! It is ourselves who will 
come to power in the fall. 
  [Ulanskiy] We? 
  [Baburin] We, is the Russian pan-national union and state- 
patriotic organizations. We have no use for either today's 
ruiners or impostors who chant patriotic slogans while having 
always supported the ruining of the country in practice. 
  [Ulanskiy] Power is wonderful. But who is after all going 
to decide today on who is to quit the political stage and who is 
to emerge onto it? 
  [Baburin] Parliament, among others. If it finds no common 
language, well, early elections should be called both for 
parliament and president. There's nothing awful about that. 
  [Ulanskiy] Do you agree with the slogans with which the 
implacable opposition has defiled the White House environs: 
"Prosecute Yeltsin's Gang," "Betar is the Guard of Bandit 
Yeltsin," and so on? 
  [Baburin] I usually make use of terms I understand. This 
topic is so far very painful for me, and I do not touch on it in 
passing. 
  [Ulanskiy] Does this mean your stance is that of open 
radicalism, that you do not call for violence, for the overthrow 
of today's authority? 
  [Baburin] For resignation, yes; for overthrow, no. So far! 
[Interview ends] 
  P.S. Baburin's last "so far" rang out like a tocsin. That 
single short remark showed that the opposition has already 
recovered from last October's concussion. It has rejected the 
treaty on accord in society only because it needs no two-year or 
even one-month truce. It is ready for spilling fresh blood now 
to satisfy its own ambitions.

newscast] 
  [Text] In the range of problems connected with insuring our 
country's security, the main question is the protection of 
Russia's present borders. This view was expressed by Valeriy 
Manilov, deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council, at a 
meeting with journalists today. 
  Preserving Russia's unique scientific and 
military-scientific 
technology, halting the outflow of intellectual and scientific 
potential to the West, stabilizing Russian policy in the Asia- 
Pacific region, and solving the problem of the Black Sea Fleet 
should become equally important areas of the Security Council's 
work, Valeriy Manilov said. 
  The increasingly unstable economy is a source of 
considerable 
danger for the country, Valeriy Manilov believes. The Security 
Council intends to play a special role in the further 
establishment of Russian political links with the United States 
and the countries of Western Europe. The first step is the 
prompt examination of options for Russia's entry to the 
Partnership for Peace program. 
  [Begin Manilov recording] There is a pressing need to 
consider all the consequences and results of joining, and above 
all, to take account of Russia's status as a great power by 
definition. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow May 6 TASS -- The conclusions of Aleksandr 
Sobyanin's expert team on the results of the elections to the 
Russian Parliament and of the December 12 referendum "smack of 
an outright provocation", ITAR-TASS was told by Sergey Filatov, 
chief of the presidential administration. 
  Commenting today on the article published by the newspaper 
IZVESTIYA, which claims that the "results of the elections and 
the referendum were rigged", Filatov said that the conclusions 
of the team "play into the hands of the irreconcilable 
opposition" at the time when the social concord agreement is 
being signed. 
  As to the team itself, which the newspaper claims to be "a 
team under the presidential administration", it is pertinent to 
note that it "has nothing to do with the administration", 
Filatov said. 
  "There is a team headed by Sobyanin, which used to analyse 
the results of the elections, the voting in the supreme soviet, 
etc., from the very first Congress of People's Deputies," 
Filatov stated. "Later, those people went into science," he 
added. The head of the presidential administration said that he 
was "most doubtful" about the methods they are using in their 
calculations. 
  Filatov said that a denial of the article was drawn up and 
would be handed over for publication to the newspaper IZVESTIYA.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Davydov report in the "Press" column: "The Minimum </F>
Task Is To Survive. The Russian Press Committee Is Fully Aware 
of This"] 
  [Excerpt] It has been decided to allocate an additional 64 
billion rubles in subsidies to the Russian press before the end 
of 1994. This was announced at a press conference in the 
Russian Press Committee. Asked where this money will go, 
Committee Deputy Chairman Sergey Gryzunov said that this will be 
decided by a subsidy distribution commission that will include 
journalists, politicians, and government officials. A priority 
right "to survive" will be given to publications which, by the 
committee's recognition, have "a worldwide reputation." 
  It was stated unequivocally that the issue today is 
precisely 
survival. The press is in such a condition that it needs a 
trillion rubles only in subsidies! Such funds, it was said, are 
unavailable. 
  Yet the Press Committee does not see the fact that 
newspapers 
are dying as anything tragic: After all, factories and mines 
are also dying! The only thing that really bothers it is the 
authorities' cynical attitude to books and the press. They, in 
Mr. Gryzunov's expression, have been put next to vodka and 
tobacco. [passage omitted]

Lyudmila Yermakova] 
  [Text] Moscow, 5 May -- Civil accord is essential now "more 
than ever, so that we can roll up our sleeves and work for 
Russia," said Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian 
Government, opening the second phase of signing of the Treaty on 
Social Accord in the Kremlin today. He called the document "a 
good medicine for treating the civil war syndrome not only in 
politics but in the economy, too". 
  In the opinion of the head of government, people "who are 
advancing the reforms, and by whose hand the domestic economy is 
being moved, remaking itself" had assembled in the Vladimir Hall 
of the Kremlin. Addressing industrialists, bankers, and 
farmers, Chernomyrdin stressed that the Treaty meets the main 
task "of seeking out civilized ways of bringing together 
personal views and approaches in order to develop the economy." 
In his view, this search should go beyond the field of 
political confrontation, "where nothing can be grown except 
weeds." 
  The head of government noted that the president, government, 
Federal Assembly, political parties, and public movements had 
made considerable efforts to get going the kind of machinery 
which could generate ideas and bring conflicting sides together. 
He believes that the Treaty "is only the start of the search 
for accord. The most important part of this idea is still 
ahead." 
  The prime minister assured people that the government had 
taken on specific pledges to deal with the paramount tasks "to 
stabilize the situation, move the economic reforms forward, 
reduce the inflation rate, implement structural reorganization, 
increase investment activity, and create the conditions for 
development of the agro-industrial sector". Chernomyrdin 
expressed the hope that active support for this would come from 
the entrepreneurs, bankers, leaseholders, and all businesses. 
He sees implementation of the Treaty only through working 
together. He also gave assurances that the government was 
obliged to pursue an active social policy aiming to target 
support at the vulnerable in society. 
  "We are now at the height of the crisis, but we can already 
feel solid ground beneath our feet," the head of government 
noted. In his opinion, "we need to push off from here and move 
upwards. To do that we need accord and the conscientious work 
of every member of society". "We cannot allow ourselves to have 
a crumbling state," the head of government stressed.

<F P=106> ["Abbreviated transcript" of concluding speech by Russian </F>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at 26 April meeting with 
editors of national and regional newspapers in Moscow: "Viktor 
Chernomyrdin: The Country Must Unite and Achieve Accord"] 
  [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian 
Government, has decided on a state subsidy to Russian newspapers 
totaling 110.4 billion rubles through the end of 1994. This 
decision was adopted at the prime minister's meeting with a 
large group of editors of national and regional newspapers. 
  It was also determined at the meeting that the distribution 
of the resources allocated by the state will be carried out by a 
public council made up of leaders of central and local media 
under the Russian Federation Committee on the Press. 
  During the meeting there was a thorough discussion of the 
situation and problems of the central and regional press and the 
need for financial support for the majority of publications, 
especially in economically weak regions. The basic provisions 
of a draft Russian Federation law on state support for the mass 
media were also discussed. Viktor Chernomyrdin briefed the 
chief editors in detail on the situation in the national economy 
and the government's economic policy. 
  In the course of the discussion the chief editors received 
the maximum information necessary to them not only for their 
daily work, but for an unbiased view of the state of affairs in 
the country. This gives them the opportunity to look more 
critically at the established view that the government 
supposedly lacks understanding of the problems of the press. 
The government regards the press not only as the "Fourth 
Estate," but as the "number one" sector, to whose situation it 
intends always to pay the keenest attention. Today we publish a 
transcript (abbreviated) of Government Chairman V.S. 
Chernomyrdin's concluding speech at the meeting with editors. 
  [Chernomyrdin] So where are we now? That is almost a 
philosophical question. We are going through a difficult period 
in the economy. Throughout the year 1993 people were 
threatening us with all kinds of cataclysms, and they are 
threatening us now, trying to rock the boat at any price. I 
must say that this no longer works with the government. 
  We do not do everything right, not everything works out for 
us, but I wish to say again that our government is now operating 
as a single organism, it has acquired the shape of the kind of 
government that the Russian state should have. That process -- 
I have never said this before -- took 18 months. And in very 
difficult conditions. You name it, we had it. But now, as long 
as people do not distract us and keep nudging us, and let us get 
on with our work, I have grounds for optimism. 
  There is no vacillation in the government. That does not 
mean that everyone is living, so to speak, in perfect harmony, 
that it is all unanimous. I would not accept that situation, 
when one person says something and everyone else nods. We have 
been through that before, we have seen it before. On the 
contrary, this is a government in which every member has his own 
opinion, his own view of matters, these are people who are 
united by their concern for the state, people who understand 
what is required of them, what they must do, and how they should 
do it. 
  The government apparatus, for all its shortcomings, is also 
beginning to gain strength and experience. I am sure, 
therefore, that the difficulties that have still to be overcome 
are within our government's power. 
  A few words about economic affairs in general. The results 
give me no particular reason to boast or to reassure myself, or 
you. Because the situation is complex. The decline in 
production is continuing, and has not yet been stopped. That is 
our main affliction today. Questions of nonpayments are 
interwoven with these problems. In general, however, the 
financial system is beginning to stabilize. First and foremost, 
we have succeeded in curbing inflation. With the exception of 
January, we have reached a stable level and are maintaining it. 
Yet do you remember how people said that we could not do it, 
that we would not be able to? Anyone would think someone else 
was going to do it on our behalf. We are keeping and will keep 
inflation within the limits indicated in the government program 
in August 1993. 
  We do not today set the goal of reducing inflation to zero. 
And we are criticized for that. I do not agree with this 
criticism. You could reduce inflation to zero quickly. If you 
stopped everything else: factories, plants, transport. That is 
intolerable! It simply means ruin for the country. It is no 
use pressing and squeezing so hard that all production processes 
stop completely. We are in a period in which it is necessary to 
keep a very sensitive finger on the pulse. 
  It is well known that factories are coming to a halt and 
plants are stopping work. The worst thing is that enterprises 
are closing that should not be closing, enterprises the country 
needs, with modern technology and essential output. But there 
are others that not only should, but simply must be closed. 
We no longer need so much of what the defense industry 
produces. We make mines; for three years now no one has wanted 
them; yet the shoe factory next door is on the brink of 
stoppage. So what is more important to us today? We do not 
need all these mines, yet we make them, because those 
people would be out on the streets otherwise. And there are so 
many plants like that in Russia! They were intended for the 
entire Soviet Union, which, at the time, stood against the whole 
world. And today, Russia is suffering because of this. 
  Here the time factor plays an enormous role in many ways. It 
took a year for the Omsk tank plant to start producing tractors, 
when they wanted to do it in three months. No way. It turns 
out that a tank is easier to make than a tractor for a farmer. 
They can't do it, they don't know how. The ones they did make 
might as well be made of gold. One defense plant, for instance, 
made a pumping jack -- not a single oilman wanted one. Because 
they made it to their own standards and put in components which 
made it three times the price of any imported model. Nobody 
bought them, and nobody will! The consumer does not want these 
jacks, and that means the country does not want them. It 
is madness to operate on the principle of "at any price." Those 
days are gone. But some managers have still not grasped that 
fact, they expect to beg or extort the money, they expect to be 
given money from the treasury. They will not get it! If 
they go on like that, what they will get is bankruptcy. 
  Can we get by without bankruptcies? No. I would like to go 
into this particularly. Bankruptcy is being used 
deliberately to intimidate people. Who is intimidating them, 
and why? Who is trying to trivialize the matter and 
present it crudely -- the gates are locked and the workers are 
outside the gates? When an enterprise goes bankrupt, as a rule 
privileged conditions apply to it: It is exempted from taxes 
and dues, for a certain period it is, in effect, given financial 
support so that it can go over to a new form of production. We 
have many enterprises that were built many years ago and have 
already operated for 30-40 years. Some need knocking down 
completely and rebuilding from scratch, others need to replace 
their technology and equipment, others again should be combined 
with similar enterprises. There is opposition. Why? 
Because, with bankruptcy, there is, without fail, a change 
of management. And this instills such fear in the managers that 
they are prepared to goad their own people into opposition, as 
long as nothing is changed. 
  Is a rescue service needed? Of course. And that means that 
funds for which provision is made in the budget will go to 
support those enterprises without which the national economy 
simply cannot function. We have some enterprises which are, so 
to speak, "one of a kind," which everyone needs. We incorporate 
special items in the budget for such enterprises, and there are 
funds which should work for their support. 
  I am saying all this because, after all, we are not likely 
to be able to stop the decline in production this year. The 
rate of decline must be halted, the trend must be broken. So we 
will channel all our resources and reserves into this, both 
intellectual and material. 
  What is the most important thing today? Investments. You 
could say that for two years we have all but stopped investing 
in the naational economy. And without that, we will never get 
anywhere. Hard as it may be, even if it means tightening our 
belts still further, investment processes must be revitalized. 
It is therefore important to get this across to people, to 
explain that Russia cannot survive without new, up-to-date 
technologies. 
  To this day some enterprises are still working to fill the 
warehouses, and there are a good many of them. What is the 
investment process? It is not only capital investments, not 
merely increased production capacities, although that is 
sometimes necessary too. It is also the updating of the machine 
tool pool, of equipment and technologies, it is thorough 
processing of raw materials and other materials. It is output 
quality. And, of course, it is competitiveness on the world 
market. 
  About rural problems. We are now making adjustments to the 
budget and increasing resources for the development of the 
agro-industrial complex, because there is no alternative. 
Things have always been difficult in the countryside, but today 
they are more difficult than ever. Therefore let us channel 
some of our resources -- even bypassing credits, that is, 
basically, giving interest-free subsidies -- into supporting the 
agrarian sphere at this stage. It is not enough to declare that 
we will not buy grain from the West, we still have to produce it 
ourselves. And not only grain. Therefore more attention must 
be paid to rural people. They cannot be made into scapegoats. 
It is too serious a matter. Often people try to blame 
everything on them, to argue that the agro-industrial complex is 
a bottomless pit in the national economy. But we were the ones 
who put them in that position. So let us rectify those 
conditions. 
  A question that is of concern to everyone is -- where are 
we, 
in fact. As I understand it, and as calculations show, we 
have reached the low point in the crisis decline. But we can 
now feel the firm ground beneath our feet. Now we must find our 
balance correctly and use this ground as a jumping-off point so 
as to start to climb again. And we are capable of doing 
this, because even today Russia retains a very considerable 
potential. Even today it is by no means a poor country. 
  We are gradually paying off our debts, for the second year 
now we are not asking anyone for anything, we just want Russia 
to enjoy conditions on the world market that are not 
humiliating, but equal, as for any other state. You remember, 
24 billion [dollars] was mentioned, and then more than 40 
billion.... We have not received much yet -- $3 billion. And 
we are going to receive 3 billion more. But these are all 
credits, this is not some kind of nonrepayable aid, it is debts 
which will have to be repaid. So this is not, so to speak, the 
secret of happiness. The main condition which we uphold 
everywhere is that we should not be kept in the lobby of the 
world market, like poor relations. We have something to offer 
in trade, we have competitive output. And this does not 
only mean raw materials! We have metal, metal products, machine 
tools, developments in space programs, in atomic power 
engineering, in nuclear matters, where we can compete. But we 
are being held back. They are still setting conditions, for 
instance, for us to enter the European Community, and that means 
that in effect they are discriminating against us. We can and 
should operate on equal terms, so as to pay our way and solve 
our own problems. And this would only make matters easier for 
our partners, too. 
  Why am I saying this? We are not poor, and we produce quite 
a lot, even given this rate of decline. We are shutting down 
oil wells, but we have enough fuel. We could produce more 
output. But what are we to do with it? We could produce more 
metal, but we cannot sell it. We could offer a different fuel, 
nuclear fuel -- we just cannot produce as much as we could sell. 
We have to stop production units, and that means accelerating 
the recession. Military plants are closing down -- there are 
problems everywhere on the weapons market. They give us nice 
big smiles, but when it comes to the crunch, suddenly there are 
thousands of reasons for not allowing us access to the Western 
market. 
  Now, about money. Say what you like, the ruble has held 
its ground. Maybe this is not so noticeable for us, but if you 
compare it with what is happening in the neighboring CIS 
countries, you can see that our tough line has produced and is 
producing results. People are no longer running away from the 
ruble. For the first time we have seen from State Committee for 
Statistics figures and from bank statistics that people have 
started accumulating rubles, saving them. 
  I have explained this before, maybe I am repeating myself. 
You could relax the financial pressure, ease up on the monetary 
and credit policy, print more money, add to the enterprises' 
circulating capital, and settle accounts, but then we will once 
again be presenting an intoxicating picture of running on the 
spot, supporting everyone indiscriminately. And we do not want 
all that! We do not want a feeble and mediocre country -- 
that is what some people refuse to understand, as they try to 
push us back into the old quagmire of universal parasitism and 
lack of responsibility. Of course Russia should have an 
effective defense complex, it should have a modern industry up 
to world standards, producing output that is competitive on any 
market. Russia cannot, by virtue of its history and its very 
nature, be an underdeveloped country willing to be fed by 
others. Therefore we can no longer have a feeble policy: that 
of giving to everyone and supporting everyone. But it is not 
enough simply to understand that, it must be brought home to 
people, explained to them. Maybe we do not talk about this 
enough, but it is the main issue today. 
  Here the role and position of the press is particularly 
important. You journalists, better than anyone else, understand 
and feel the country's pulse, the people's mood. Try to explain 
what is most important -- we must all unite. I think the Treaty 
on Social Accord will take effect, but much will still have to 
be done for the accord to be realized, for it not to remain only 
on paper. The country must unite and achieve accord. It is not 
discord we need now, but cohesion. 
  A problem of statewide significance is the struggle against 
crime. The federal program on this topic, which was recently 
approved by the president, must be fulfilled. We are trying to 
provide everything that the program stipulates in the budget. 
And we must give the maximum, because the people no longer 
understand us. The fact that you cannot walk the streets, that 
you cannot travel by train, that you cannot go on the subway -- 
this is simply impermissible. The state's role here is 
paramount. Of course, it is not all just up to the law 
enforcement organs. This is a scourge that we must all deal 
with together, and the press too must play a more active part. 
  Much depends on you. It is no use shying away from it now, a 
lack of restraint in the press and permissiveness in life cannot 
be tolerated. You must criticize, you must argue, but you must 
not insult or offend people just for fun, for the sake of a fine 
turn of phrase. This annoys people and tears society apart. 
Sometimes you read things and wonder: Is nothing sacred any 
more? Anyone would think we were not living in the same 
country. This is what must be left behind, you can do it, you 
know how. 
  I think all you have to do is try. The government will meet 
with media workers and leaders -- I promise you that. You must 
know more, you must have the information. You must see how the 
government operates, so that you can put us straight when 
necessary. You can do that too, you know how. 
  Of course it is upsetting to see needy people, the plight of 
pensioners and war veterans is distressing. But we will support 
the veterans and the low-paid, we will pull up the living 
standards of the needy. This is not unfounded populism. Our 
rate of income is already above the rate of inflation. 
  Today we are beginning here to break the negative 
trends that characterized the country's development over the 
last two or three years. And we will break them, but it needs 
patience, for the sake of the country, for the sake of the 
children, so that they do not find themselves in a humiliating 
position. Hard times have fallen to our lot, we must bear it 
and we must respond. Let us grit our teeth, and things will be 
easier for all the people. And we will come through. We cannot 
fail to come through. We do not have the right. And I will not 
accept any other viewpoint today.

  [Text] At the moment, Russia is sufficiently provided with 
grain to enable it to give up centralized grain imports, Russian 
Vice Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha told a news conference 
in Moscow Thursday. 
  Zaveryukha dismissed reports in the Western media of 
projected purchases of grain in the USA saying no talks had been 
held on this issue. 
  According to his information, enterprises of 
Roskhleboprodukt 
stored 17 million tons of grain, while another 1.5 million tons 
may be purchased from domestic farmers. Therefore, given a 
monthly consumption of 2.8 million tons, the stocks will last 
for six months. 
  Zaveryukha pointed out that the minimum purchases of grain 
would be made only for Russia's northern most regions and the 
Far East due to a high cost of shipping grain to the regions 
from Central Russia. However, these purchases, which have 
already amounted to about 200,000 tonnes, will be made 
exclusively on a commercial basis, without state participation. 
  Moreover, Russia has already exported three million tons of 
last year's grain to neighboring republics. 
  Zaveryukha established the fact that given average harvests 
of 100 million tons Russia was quite capable of providing itself 
with grain. At the same time, he refrained from prognosticating 
about the future harvest, because "much would depend on weather 
conditions." 
  Over recent years, Russia has traditionally imported grain. 
In 1992, as many as 26 million tons were delivered to Russia, 
while in 1993 grain imports exceeded 10 million tons.

  [Text] Moscow May 6 TASS -- "The Russian economy has 
embarked upon the most difficult stage of reforms. We must see 
that they bring sprouts of revitalisation and not new sufferings 
to the country," First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets told the 
newspaper "ROSSIA". His interview is published in today's issue 
of the daily. 
  Soskovets said that the government had begun to determine 
what projects should be supported from the budget. It was 
decided to render government support to the coal industry. It 
is to get from the budget 3.4 trillion roubles in the first six 
months of this year. A decision was also adopted to settle in 
the first quarter of this year the mutual debts of several 
enterprises of the defence industry, the agro-industrial sector, 
and the fuel and energy complex. Quotas were fixed for the 
export of strategic raw materials, as well as customs duties for 
imported goods. A list of federal programmes that are to be 
financed from the budget this year was drawn up. All but ready 
are proposals to effect state control over railway fares and 
over the cost of electric and thermal energy. "Not all the 
measures can be regarded as 100 per cent market oriented, but 
the government is compelled to take them," Soskovets stresses. 
  "In spite of some successes, the economic situation remains 
unstable," he notes. "Crisis phenomena were not stemmed last 
year. The situation in the first quarter of this year is 
characterised by the continuing industrial slump, shrinking 
capital investments, accompanied by the growth of prices for 
factory-made products and consumer goods." 
  "The steps taken by the government are still not yielding 
the 
expected results," Soskovets states. At the same time, he 
stresses that "market relations are gaining strength in the 
Russian economy and measures are being taken to reduce the 
social burden of the transition period. Steps were taken to 
curb the inflation. The process of privatisation is proceeding 
quite dynamically. The non- state sector of economy is gaining 
momentum. The investment decline was slowed down. The consumer 
market is being restored. The country's foreign trade balance 
is favourable."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Liliya Luznetsova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 5 May -- The extremely poor state of the 
nation's health is indicated by the infant mortality level. 
Over the last three years a constant increase in the number of 
children not surviving their first year of life has been 
observed in Russia. 
  Whereas in 1990 an average of 17.4 babies per 1,000 births 
were dying, the figure became 17.8 in 1992, 18 in 1993, and 19 a 
year later. 
  These figures from the Russian Federation's national report 
to the eighth world conference on the situation of women, which 
is to be held in Beijing next year, are capable of shocking 
medical specialists throughout the world -- which is not 
surprising since in the advanced countries the figure for baby 
mortality in recent years has not only not increased, but has 
indeed decreased and stabilized at a level of five to eight 
deaths of children in their first year per 1,000 births. 
  According to statistics there has been a deterioration too 
in 
the health of babies. Whereas three years ago one in seven 
babies were born ill or became ill, the figure rose in the 
following year to one in six, and a year later it was one in 
five. 
  A steady increase in illness among children below the age of 
14 years has also been noted. Our children are particularly 
suffering from illnesses affecting the organs of the respiratory 
tract, the alimentary tract, and the nervous system. 
  The number of congenital deformities and development defects 
is also growing. The number of such defects per 1,000 people 
has increased by over 28 percent, while the number of tumors in 
children has risen by almost a quarter. 
  The appearance of a "sick generation" of Russians is shown 
by 
the fact that child invalids alone in the country (by WHO 
estimates) now number hundreds of thousands. In the pre-school 
age group, 15-20 percent of children are suffering chronic 
illnesses, and by the time they leave school almost half of the 
children are limited in their choice of vocation by the state of 
their health. Specialists claim that only one tenth of Russian 
schoolchildren are in practice healthy.

  [Text] Due to the economic difficulties in the country, the 
financing of military orders and research in Russia has been 
reduced approximately 10-fold. Some enterprises are simply 
refusing to produce military equipment. At the request of our 
correspondent, Colonel General Sergey Mayev, deputy commander in 
chief of the Russian land forces, comments: 
  [Begin Mayev recording] Russia will be able to maintain its 
position among the leading manufacturers of new types of 
weapons. What is my conviction based on? First, the fact that 
we have always had very powerful scientific and technical ideas 
and our military industry is very powerfully developed. [end 
recording] 
  As for the drop in financing, the general said that it is 
always 1.5-2 times lower than in the advanced Western countries. 
The difference has of course now greatly increased, but this 
gap, in the view of the general, can be bridged by the internal 
resources of defense enterprises. General Mayev does not reveal 
what resources they are, but he thinks that they include the use 
of high- technology, the search for unconventional production 
and scientific solutions, and the best possible implementation 
of conversion. 
  As for the types of weapons which are a priority in the 
Russian Army and the defense industry, according to Gen. Mayev, 
deputy commander of the Russian land forces, it is a queston of 
two areas: The development of traditional types of weapons and 
the creation of promising systems. He said that the latter 
included high-precision weapons, means for gathering 
intelligence and managing forces. This is the principled 
approach taken by the Russian military toward the weapons issue 
within the new Russian military doctrine.

  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic 
correspondents Boris Krivoshey and Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Russia intends to continue the moratorium on nuclear 
explosions with the aim of securing favorable conditions and 
political support for conducting multilateral talks on working 
out a treaty on the comprehensive nuclear test ban, Russian 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing here 
today. 
  Commenting on the second round of these talks due to begin 
within the framework of the disarmament conference in Geneva on 
May 16, Grigoriy Karasin stressed that the treaty to be worked 
out was not only a means for the strengthening of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime but also the important step towards the 
furtherance of strategic stability. 
  The Russian side regards work on this treaty as a "priority 
direction in the activities of the disarmament conference in 
1994", the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman told journalists. 
  According to Grigoriy Karasin, at the forthcoming meeting 
Russia will seek to "intensify multilateral talks with the aim 
of preparing a treaty, possibly by the spring of 1995 which 
would considerably promote the success of the oncoming 
conference devoted to the prolongation of the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty scheduled for this period".

  [Text] A meeting of the commission for financial issues of 
the Russian armed forces presided over by First Deputy Defense 
Minister Andrey Kokoshin Thursday focused on the results of 
financing the army over the first four months of this year and 
the spending of particular units and districts. 
  Salaries of officers and civilian personnel, food, nuclear 
security and combat training were among the priorities. It was 
pointed out that the withdrawal of Russian troops and their 
accommodation required an unprecedented amount of money. 
  As for the funds set aside from military appropriations to 
pay for the state defense orders, they were used mainly to pay 
for the production of combat management and communications 
hardware, high- precision weapons and radio and electronic 
counteraction means. 
  According to a Defense Ministry statement, the meeting was 
told that financing the army activities involved long delays, 
while the state's debt to the army and the defense industries 
continued to grow.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The fire which broke 
out at Beloyarsk nuclear power station (Sverdlovsk oblast in the 
Urals) at 0924 at the third power unit of Beloyarsk AES was 
still not extinguished by 1300 today. The ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was informed of this in the Information and Public 
Relations Directorate of the Ministry of Atomic Energy of the 
Russian Federation. 
  In the opinion of specialists, the workforce, population, 
and 
environment are not being affected by radiation. The accident 
has been given a preliminary assessment of level one on the 
international scale of nuclear incidents (the levels are graded 
one to seven -- Chernobyl was grade seven). 
  The fire broke out during repair work on the third power 
unit 
which has been under repair since 23 April. There was a leak of 
non-radioactive sodium from the drainage of the secondary 
circuit in one of the machine rooms. The sodium ignited. 
Efforts to extinguish the fire are continuing.

  [Text] The decision whether Russia will construct its own 
launch site on the basis of a strategic missile division 
stationed in the Far East will probably be made before the end 
of 1994, a spokesman for the Russian space forces told Interfax 
Thursday. 
  According to the U.S.-Russian Strategic Arms Reduction 
Treaty, a center for testing and use of space equipment is to be 
set up on the basis of the strategic missile division near 
Svobodny-18, Amur region. In the division's silos, most of 
which have been dismantled, there were 60 NATO class SS-11 
missiles. 
  Experts believe that the first launch from the site will 
quite possibly take place in 1996 as projected. Nevertheless, 
the only work currently in progress in Svobodny-18 is aimed at 
maintaining the city's infrastructure and the remaining silos. 
Looking for ways to launch the Rokot carrier rocket from both a 
silo and a pad is also going on. 
  According to the officer, Rokot may be used both for 
military 
and research purposes. The modification of the launch pad for 
Rokot had virtually not been started, he added. "If the order 
were given, it would take no longer than six months to 
accomplish the task," he said. 
  The three-stage light carrier rocket Rokot was designed by 
the Salyut bureau on the basis of a combat missile RS-18, due to 
be dismantled under the START-2 treaty. Rokot is capable of 
taking space equipment weighing up to two tonnes to a near earth 
round- circle orbit with an apogee of about 1,000 kilometers and 
that weighing less than 300 kilograms to an elliptic orbit with 
an apogee of up to 40,000 kilometers above the surface. 
  Rokot has a launch weight of 106.7 tones and is 24.6 meters 
long, with a maximum diameter of 2.5 meters. The Khrunichev 
State Space Research and Industrial Center is now developing 
booster stages for Rokot.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lashch report: "Russian Intelligence Service as </F>
Book Reviewer. The FIS Refutes Key Theses of a Book on Nuclear 
Espionage"] 
  [Text] Last week, the Russian mass media started 
publishing excerpts from the memoirs of Pavel Sudoplatov, a 
grand master of Soviet espionage and sabotage in the 
1930's-1950's. One of its main sections is devoted to the 
intelligence service's involvement in the creation of Soviet 
nuclear weapons and contains sensational revelations implicating 
the world's key scientists of the time -- Enrico Fermi, Leo 
Szilard, and Robert Oppenheimer -- in leaking Western nuclear 
secrets to the USSR. Yesterday, your KOMMERSANT- DAILY 
correspondent asked Tatyana Samolis, press secretary of the 
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] chief, to comment on 
the allegations. 
  Ms. Samolis told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that 
the 
FIS chiefs have already worked out their stance on the matter. 
They think that some passages in Sudoplatov's book are a 
compilation of actual events, half-truths, and pure invention. 
The FIS still holds the opinion that Soviet scientists made a 
decisive contribution to the creation of nuclear weapons in the 
USSR, whereas intelligence efforts, albeit important and 
qualified, had only a secondary role to play. 
  The FIS director's press secretary did not deny that 
starting 
September 1941 the Soviet intelligence service did receive 
truthful information on efforts to create nuclear weapons in the 
United States and the United Kingdom, something which helped 
solve a number of technical problems and accelerate the process 
of nuclear arms development. But events related to intelligence 
activity in that area and the roles of many players were 
interpreted in too free, often even incorrect, a manner in Pavel 
Sudoplatov's memoirs. 
  Although special services tend to avoid specific comments on 
their methods and sources of information, this time Ms. Samolis 
categorically denied allegations contained in the book that the 
Soviet intelligence service received information on the nuclear 
problem directly from as prominent scientists as Fermi, Szilard, 
and Oppenheimer.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- The Russian Foreign 
Intelligence Service denied reports that a group of famous US 
A-bomb designers had sold the secrets of the weapon to the 
former Soviet Union and added that Soviet spies had played only 
a "support role" in the creation of the mass destruction arms in 
the USSR. 
  "Allegations that Soviet intelligence received information 
on 
atomic bomb directly from such noted scientists as Enrico Fermi, 
Leo Scillard, Robert Oppenheimer and others do not correspond to 
reality", the press bureaus of the Foreign Intelligence Service 
said in a statement for TASS on Thursday. 
  It was commenting on the allegations published in a book of 
former Soviet top KGB agent Pavel Sudoplatov. 
  The intelligence service also said that the book is a 
"mosaic 
of truthful events, semi-truth and open inventions". 
  "The very events and the role of many participants are 
interpreted in a free and often the wrong way", it said adding 
that the author exaggerates his role in the creation of the 
Soviet A- bomb. 
  "The atomic and thermonuclear weapons were created in the 
Soviet Union mostly thanks to a mighty scientific, technical and 
intellectual potential. The decisive contribution was made by a 
big group of scientists", the press service said, but admitted 
that Soviet intelligence learned in September 1941 about the 
nuclear research which was going on in the United States and 
Great Britain. 
  "Later in close contact with scientists it organised the 
delivery of secret information from abroad which helped Soviet 
experts in solving a number of complicated scientific and 
technical problems and decreased the time in which the Soviet 
Union designed its own atomic weapons", the press service said. 
  It added, however, that "as far as the contribution of the 
intelligence to the creation of the Soviet A-bomb is concerned, 
its important and skilled work in the interests of the state 
played a support role".

<F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva report under the "Money" rubric: </F>
"Budget Committee Intent on Tightening Control Over Foreign 
Debt. Draft To Be Considered Following State Duma's Move"] 
  [Text] The State Duma budget committee's subcommittee on 
currency regulation has drawn up the draft federal law "On the 
Maximum Amount of Foreign Borrowing by the Russian Federation 
and the Maximum Amount of Credits To Be Granted by It to Foreign 
States in 1994." The draft law is designed to tighten control 
over the growth in Russia's foreign debt, which has already 
exceeded $80 billion. Under the draft law, Russia's 
international treaties on attracting or granting state credits 
are subject to mandatory ratification by parliament. In that 
respect the draft law is a logical follow-up to the presidential 
edict "On the Procedure for Decisionmaking on the Conclusion of 
International Treaties" of 8 November 1993. 
  It is well known that thanks to negotiations with its 
creditor countries, Russia paid only $2 billion in 1992 and $2.2 
billion in 1993 instead of the $20 billion due under the initial 
payment schedule. In 1994, payments toward debt servicing and 
debt repayment, taking into account those postponed from 1993, 
are expected to reach $32 billion or an estimated 70 percent of 
overall exports forecast for 1994 by committee specialists and 
IMF experts -- of course, unless Russian negotiators manage to 
reach an agreement with Western creditors on debt rescheduling, 
restructuring, or canceling a part of the debt altogether. At 
the same time, according to the draft's authors, "International 
experience has shown that countries exceeding the debt-servicing 
rate of 25 percent tend to be unable to cope with the debt 
problem on their own, without a partial cancellation of the 
debt." 
  Given that, the lower chamber's budget committee has 
proposed 
that the parliament ratify not only agreements on attracting or 
granting credits that exceed the upper limit it would set 
annually, but also where the amount of money to be attracted or 
granted exceeds $100 million. 
  The subcommittee has also proposed that the limit of foreign 
borrowing for 1994 be reduced to $4.7 billion, whereas the 
Finance Ministry, drawing on its calculations, has suggested 
that it be raised to $5.7 billion. It is expected that the 
draft law will be considered by the State Duma at one of its 
first meetings after it moves to its new building.

  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- The Russian parliament is 
preparing to ratify an agreement on the creation of free trade 
zones signed by heads of state and governments of the 
Commonwealth countries, Vladimir Meshcheryakov, deputy chairman 
of the state customs committee of the Russian Federation, told 
BUSINESS-TASS. 
  According to Vladimir Meshcheryakov, the Federation Council 
plans to hold hearings on the preparation for ratification of 
this package of documents on May 16. 
  The signing of the agreement on the establishment of free 
trade zones, the deputy chairman of the state customs committee 
noted, is the first stage in the process of economic drawing 
together of the Commonwealth countries. The second stage will 
mark the transition to a customs union. 
  In both cases, Vladimir Meshcheryakov explained, there will 
be no quantitative and tariff restrictions in mutual trade but 
the existence of free trade zones does not prevent the state 
from the independent determination of its foreign economic 
policy. After all, a customs union is first of all common 
customs tariffs. 
  Vladimir Meshcheryakov paid attention to the fact that a 
concept of free trade in the Commonwealth is not applied in a 
pure form now. In practice the so-called exceptions from the 
free trade regime are employed which were legalized by bilateral 
agreements between Russia and other Commonwealth countries 
signed in 1992-1993. 
  These exceptions concern export tariffs, quotas and 
licenses. 
For this reason the agreement signed by leaders of the 
Commonwealth countries on April 15 is considerably advancing the 
Commonwealth towards the establishment of a customs union, 
Vladimir Meshcheryakov pointed out.

  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin could meet with his Chechen 
counterpart Dzhokhar Dudayev only if the Chechen president 
recognized that his republic is part of the Russian Federation. 
However, it is more likely that a dialogue with Dudayev will be 
conducted by Russia's Premier Victor Chernomyrdin since economic 
talks are seen as the chief means for Moscow and Groznyy to 
smooth their relations. The Russian Counterintelligence Service 
Director Sergey Stepashin made these statements at a meeting 
with lawmakers and cabinet officials from Kabardino-Balkaria in 
Nalchik Thursday [5 May] night. 
  On the situation in North Caucasus, Stepashin noted that 
regional stability was wishful thinking without a settlement 
with Chechnya. The way it is, as Stepashin put it, the republic 
poses a threat for Russia's stability. For one thing, he 
stressed, Grozny financially supports opposition movements 
across the North Caucasus. 
  A dialogue with Dudayev, in Stepashin's opinion, should be 
pursued in "a tough key," and the prime task is to safeguard the 
railways crossing Chechnya. 
  According to Stepashin, there is an entirely different 
situation in Kabardino-Balkaria, where the president, 
parliament, and government are explicitly in favor of keeping 
Russia's integrity as a state. He called for using 
Kabardino-Balkaria's potential to guarantee peace in the North 
Caucasus, normalize the situation in the region, advance the 
negotiating processes, and draw up recommendations on how to 
settle conflicts, above all between Osetians and Ingushes. 
  In regard to rampant crime in Russia, Stepashin urged the 
stiffening of the federal penal code and judicial system. By 
federal intelligence information, there are about 150,000 guns 
in private possession in Russia, and some Russian gangs are even 
armed with heavy weapons.

  [Text] A meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev 
can take place only on condition that the Chechen leader 
recognizes that his republic is a part of the Russian 
Federation. Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, said this at a meeting on Thursday 
evening with members of the parliament and government of 
Kabarda-Balkaria in Nalchik. He expressed the view that Viktor 
Chernomyrdin is most likely to hold a dialogue with the Chechen 
leader since economic talks are the main way of resolving 
relations between Moscow and Groznyy. 
  Regarding the situation in the northern Caucasus, the 
director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service noted that 
one cannot speak of stabilization in the region without a 
settlement of relations with Chechnya. Stepashin said that, in 
its present form this republic represents a threat to the 
stability of the Russian Federation. In the view of the head of 
Russian counterintelligence, dialogue with Dudayev should be 
conducted in a tough manner and the primary task is 
normalization of the situation on the railroads crossing 
Chechnya.

  [Text] Nazran -- Isa Kostoyev, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Council's Constitutional Legislation Committee, 
stated that together with Ingushetia's justice minister he has 
prepared for President Yeltsin proposals on settling the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict. In particular it is proposed -- under 
the supervision of an authorized representative of the Russian 
Federation president -- before 20 May to return all refugees and 
forced resettlers to six residential areas in Prigorodnyy Rayon 
and by 20 September to return them to all the rayon's villages. 
"The provisional administration can do a lot if it wants to, 
but its leadership has no such wish," Mr. Kostoyev said. 
"Vladimir Lozovoy should be replaced and the provisional 
administration moved to neutral territory."

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Frolov report under the "Atom" rubric: "No </F>
Accident Has Occurred at Kolskaya Nuclear Power Plant. But the 
Region's Electric Power Supply System Is Under Threat"] 
  [Text] The report about an emergency shutdown of the 
fourth power unit at the Kolskaya Nuclear Power Plant, which was 
carried by news agencies and Russian television on 4 May, is not 
true. At any rate this is what Georgiy Kaurov, chief of the 
Atomic Energy Ministry information administration, said. In a 
conversation with your SEGODNYA correspondent, he explained that 
the planned shutdown of the power bloc to replace spent fuel 
cells occurred much earlier -- on 29 April -- and did not have 
any bearing on any emergency situation. 
  Nonetheless, this interest in the shutdown of yet another 
power unit at the Kolskaya Nuclear Power Plant has been aroused 
not only by the Chernobyl syndrome. The power plant produces 
60-70 percent of the Kola peninsula's electric power. The 
second and third power units were shut down for emergency repair 
even earlier. Presently, only the first power unit -- the 
oldest one, which was put into operation back in 1973 -- is 
operating at its design capacity (440 megawatts). This power 
unit was involved in what was probably the most serious accident 
at the Kolskaya Nuclear Power Plant: on 2 February 1993, a 
hurricane broke the supply of external electric energy; two 
emergency diesels units that powered cooling system pumps were 
also put out of action. For two and a half hours the reactor 
was cooled by the natural circulation of water in the circuits. 
  In terms of security, the current situation at the power 
plant is not comparable with that one, but not so in terms of 
the threat posed to the region's electric power potential. The 
situation has been exacerbated by perennial failures of 
consumers to repay debts. Last September they nearly caused a 
shutdown of the nuclear power plant and a disconnection of 
debtors from their power supply.

  [Text] Makhachkala May 6 TASS -- Lezghins and 
Azerbaijanians living in Derbent in the Republic of Daghestan 
(in southern part of the Russian Federation, between the eastern 
greater Caucasus and the Caspian Sea) held crowded rallies in 
various parts of the city on Thursday. 
  There were also skirmishes between the representatives of 
the 
two nationalities, sometimes gunshots could be heard. 
Fortunately, there were no casualties. 
  Units of the Interior Ministry troops and OMON (riot police) 
arrived in Derbent from neighbouring districts and managed to 
stabilize the situation. However, the tension was not relieved 
completely. 
  Both Lezghins and Azerbaijanians put forward nationalist 
mottoes and demanded at the separate rallies that heads of the 
city and district authorities resign. 
  The participants in the rallies appealed to the republic's 
leadership to restore order to Derbent and to the southern part 
of Daghestan as a whole and to protect the rights of the local 
population. 
  The cause of the unrest traces back to a quarrel between 
several Lezghins and Azerbaijanians which took place the other 
day and ended in a fight and shootout. As a result, two 
Lezghins were killed, several people, including teenagers, were 
wounded. 
  After that, a hundred of Lezghins blocked a motor way 
leading 
to Derbent. They stopped a car, in which Sayid Kurbanov, head 
of the district administration, his deputy and head of the 
Derbent police rode. 
  The policeman-driver was disarmed by unidentified persons. 
  Kurbanov was arrested and taken to an unknown locality "to 
continue the negotiations". He was released soon.

  [Text] Kazan -- President Shaymiyev has stated that a 
high- level bilateral commission will soon be set up to examine 
the implementation of treaty-based obligations between the 
Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan. He stressed 
that without assistance from Russia the economic situation in 
Tataria would have been substantially worse. "At present we are 
receiving much more from the federal budget for current expenses 
than we remit. To conduct spring agricultural work alone the 
republic has received an easy credit of 65 billion rubles, which 
exceeds our contribution to the Russian budget by almost 10 
times."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Democrats Separate Themselves From </F>
Liberals"] 
  [Text] On Saturday in the House of Culture of Medical 
Workers there was a conference of the Equal Rights and Legality 
[RiZ] voter bloc. 
  As became clear from the discussion, in 20 of the republic's 
rayons the bloc's activists had not yet submitted registration 
documents to rayon executive organs. In seven of them the 
documents have been submitted and the organizations have been 
registered. 
  RiZ has postponed the question of compiling a consolidated 
list for the forthcoming elections to representative organs of 
power of the Republic of Tatarstan until the lists of candidate 
deputies in political organizations are coordinated. 
  The greatest amount of discussion was evoked by the second 
question on the agenda, which was raised by republic People's 
Deputy Z. Latypov--on the RiZ voter bloc subscribing to the 
Agreement on Accord signed on 28 April in Moscow. 
  Opinions differed sharply. The bloc's leader, State Duma 
Deputy I. Grachev, stated that because of his participation in 
the Yabloko faction he could not support Z. Latypov's 
initiative. But he feels all right about the signing. In the 
voting, I. Grachev and also RiZ acting chairman, I. Sultanov, 
and the leader of the city party organization created on the 
basis of Russia's Choice, D. Galyautdinov, abstained. 
  As usual, the discussion and the outcome of the voting led 
the disputing parties to personal accusations. 
  And although in the corridors things did not reach the point 
of "physical disagreement," during the recess certain hotheads 
lapsed into unprintable language. In our opinion, the 
ideological separation of liberals and democrats within the RiZ 
bloc is proceeding painfully but predictably. 
  The position against signing the still unstudied text of the 
agreement was argued most consistently by the chairman of the 
Tatar division of the SDPR [Social Democratic Party of Russia], 
Deputy Chairman of Vakhitovskiy Rayon Soviet Yu. Rostovshikov, 
and the leader of the local organization of the DPR [Democratic 
Party of Russia], I. Konov? 
  In the end 11 members of the council of the RiZ bloc voted 
in 
favor of joining the Agreement on Accord. They were one vote 
short of having enough to adopt a decision.

<F P=106> [Report from roundup of ITAR-TASS reports: "Navigation </F>
Opened on Volga"] 
  [Text] The opening of navigation for 1994 has taken place 
in Nizhniy Novgorod. 
  After a band had played marches and welcoming speeches had 
been delivered the first diesel ship, the Dobrynya Nikitich, set 
off for Astrakhan with fleet veterans on board. Specialists 
predict that this year's navigation will be difficult: 
Inflation is growing and the number of those who want to sail 
along the Volga is declining. To make ends meet the sailors 
intend as before to rent out some of the ships as floating 
hotels. 
  Will this affect livestock raising? Most probably not. If 
only because the livestock population in Russia has been reduced 
by approximately 25 percent and in some places by even 30 
percent. 
  This year there is no need to be worried about seed. There 
is plenty, and in some places there is even a surplus. This is 
largely explained by the high cost of seed -- many farms and 
private farmers simply cannot afford them which, of course, will 
also entail a reduction in sown areas. 
  As a whole there is no problem with fuel and lubricants 
either, although in individual oblasts, for instance Novosibirsk 
Oblast, drivers are refueling direct from the tanker trucks. 
And that is impermissible. 
  It cannot be said that the farms and private farmers have 
money to carry out the spring field work. Although credits for 
April were issued in full, in the opinion of the Ministry of 
Agriculture they are blatantly inadequate. So the question of 
the issue of May credits is on the agenda.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Vitaliy Cherkasov followed by </F>
commentary by Aleksandr Gavrilyuk under general heading: "As Ye 
Sow So Shall Ye Reap"] 
  [Text] Gorodishchenskiy Rayon, Volgograd Oblast -- The 
sowing toil has reached the Lower Volga. Ivan Shabunin, head of 
the Volgograd Oblast administration, ordered that the peasants 
be paid all the state's debts for last year's grain back in 
early April. The countryside was provided with fuel and 
lubricants for the entire campaign. 
  At night on the field near the village of Novyy Rogachik, 
Gorodishchenskiy Rayon, the tractor drivers were harrowing the 
winter fallow. 
  "They are hurrying to lock in the moisture," explained 
Nikolay Telitchenko, deputy director of the "Luch" 
agro-industrial limited partnership. "Put you hope in god, but 
don't slip up yourself. That is why people are working day and 
night. We shall do the harrowing and start the sowing...." 
  That is the sowing technology. It was elaborated by 
scientists from the Volgograd agricultural institute and from 
the V.I. Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The 
point of this program is to obtain the forecasted grain harvest 
in any weather conditions. Even if not a single drop of rain 
falls all summer, which in the Lower Volga region happens quite 
often. 
  That is why no one here ever pins any hope on the weather. 
  "The present harvest was conceived the year before last," 
Nikolay Telitchenko explains the essence of dry arable farming. 
"It was then that the entire winter crop area was left to bare 
fallow." 
  This year the "Luch" limited partnership obtained an average 
of 45 quintals of wheat [per hectare]. And that is on clay or 
at best on red soil. In addition on these arid steppes the 
grain that is grown is strong. In barter exchange between farms 
this grain is very advantageous: One tonne of elite wheat seed 
grain is equal to two tonnes of feed grain. 
  Sometimes this home-grown barter can provide three or five 
tonnes of feed grain. 
  That is how "Luch" survives. No one here is groaning, 
panicking, or intending to go on strike. There are no 
stoppages, everyone is working. And that even with our 
ubiquitous nonpayments. [Cherkasov report ends] 
<H5>  Specialists' Opinion </H5>
  Today the spring field work is at its height and in the 
opinion of Ivan Gridasov, chief of the Ministry of Agriculture 
plant growing administration, it is ahead of last year's 
schedule. Over 3 million hectares have already been sown to 
spring crops. 
  Unfortunately, the state of the winter crops is considerably 
worse. About 3 million hectares will have to be resown -- it is 
a long time since that happened and it is connected primarily 
with the weather. In the fall they sowed without rain, into the 
dry soil, and in addition frost struck immediately. As a result 
1 million hectares have already been resown and last year this 
figure was only 100,000 hectares. The saddest thing is that 
this affects primarily winter wheat and as a result there is a 
reduction in the gross harvest of this crop. 
  In the opinion of Ministry of Agriculture experts losses 
will 
be about 10 million tonnes. The situation is further aggravated 
by the fact that this year at least half the amount of 
fertilizers and plant protection agents will be applied to the 
soil. Moreover sown areas are being reduced by approximately 
4.5 million hectares, primarily because of the lack of land in 
suburban regions. Of these hectares half are usually sown to 
grain crops. Cottages are now growing up in their place.

dire situation has not brought the gunsmiths at Izhevsk's 
"Mekhanicheskiy Zavod" Plant to their knees. On the contrary, 
it has made them act quickly and display a lot of initiative. 
  And so missiles and electronic guidance systems for missiles 
have disappeared, to be replaced by laser video recorders, 
"Kompanyon" computers, magnificent electro-cardio-stimulators, 
and much else besides. For example, this intercity public pay 
telephone. The plant's designers have excelled themselves, 
developing highly original goods within an extremely short 
period, such as this pump-action gun, for example. Its 
versatility is simply enviable. This and other innovations 
caused a big stir at a recent exhibition in Nuremberg. 
  Incidentally, the exhibition of the plant's output is not 
confined to firearms. It also includes purely civilian goods 
produced with hi-tech methods and therefore in great demand.

  [Text] All the border violating ships which were revealed 
by the naval division of the North-Eastern frontier district in 
the course of the first stage of the operation Putina-94 were 
Russian ones, deputy chief of the division headquarters Sergey 
Sergeyev told INTERFAX. 
  The aim of the operation Putina-94 which was started on 
April 
20 is to combat illegal fishery in the Far East. 
  As Sergeyev said, the frontier guards have inspected 22 
ships, 12 of them were Russians, eight crafts belonged to Japan, 
two to North Korea. "The frontier guards exposed seven 
violating ships which were sailing under the Russian flag," 
noted Sergeyev. Penalties were imposed on five ships for 
violations in filling in their fishery journals and three of 
them for polluting of the sea. 
  As many as two ships, the Sakhalin floating base 
Konstitutsiya SSSR and the Primorsk transport ship Subaru, 
violated the customs rules. An investigation is to be continued 
on land. 
  In addition, the frontier guards were forced to chase one 
ship, the Nakhodka trawler Stal which disobeyed the order to 
stop. When the inspection group came aboard the trawler, it 
failed to find any violations. "It was just instinct on the 
part of the Stal's captain -- if you are chased, then run away. 
He received a warning from the frontier guards," said Sergeyev. 
  In general as many as 20 Russian and four foreign ships were 
caught in the course of the Putina-94 operation, Commander of 
the Pacific Frontier District Major General Vitaliy Sedykh 
declared at a press conference devoted to the conclusion of the 
first stage of the operation and staged on Friday in Vladivostok. 
  According to Sedykh, as many as 700 ships were found in 
Russia's economic zone, including more than 200 foreign ships. 
The frontier guards have inspected more than 100 Russian and 20 
foreign ships which appeared to be Japanese fishing boats. The 
captains of three fishing boats made violations in compiling 
permission cards for the fishery of sea products in the Russian 
economic zone and were deprived of them. 
  On April 22 a Japanese fishing boat Elyu-Maru-86 violated 
the 
rules near the Southern Kurils by not passing one of the 
checking points. A penalty of 15,385 dollars was imposed on the 
crew. 
  Ships assigned to the Pacific Fleet, fish protection bodies 
Primorrybvoda and Sakhrybvoda, employees of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service and of the Far Eastern Customs 
Department participated in the operation along with the frontier 
guards of the Pacific frontier district. 
  Tracking devices to monitor the situation in this region 
were 
used in this operation.

  [Text] Chisinau, 5 May -- The heads of the Moldovan and 
Belarusian Governments signed an agreement on commercial and 
economic cooperaton in 1994 in Chisinau today. According to 
Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, this document removes 
obstacles to the movement of goods between the two countries. 
Minsk is now one of Chisinau's main partners. Chisinau sends 
foodstuffs to Belarus, receiving in return engineering products 
and refined fuel. 
  Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich told ITAR-TASS 
that the greatest obstacle to integration among the CIS 
countries was the shortcomings of the payments system and 
fluctuations in currency rates. Merging monetary systems with 
Russia would not be an impediment in Belarus's relations with 
the other republics, but, on the contrary, would work to get rid 
of this shortcoming. He denied rumors saying differences had 
arisen between the leadership of Russia and Belarus over 
differing approaches to the merger of monetary systems. The 
first stage, Vyacheslav Kebich said, of this merger is now under 
way: removing duties, quotas, licences and other obstacles to 
the movement of goods and people. 
  "What we are doing with Russia is way ahead of the processes 
taking place in the CIS and even the proposal by President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan for a Euroasian Union," 
Kebich emphasized. "We believe that our example might perhaps be 
followed by other republics, which will achieve the same degree 
of synchronization of legislation, as we are with Russia." 
  The Moldovan prime minister expressed regret that the time 
for merging the monetary systems of the CIS countries had been 
missed. "Moldova has introduced its own currency, and we believe 
everything has to be done to make the CIS and the inter-state 
bank, which has been set up within the CIS, work properly," he 
told ITAR-TASS. "To do this we need to summon up our courage and 
implement what has been signed at previous CIS heads meetings. 
If this happens many problems, including those concerning 
payments, will disappear."

  [Text] INTERFAX learned that the introduction of dual 
citizenship for ethnic Belarussians [Belarusians] in Moldova and 
Moldovans in Belarus will be high on the agenda of talks between 
President Mircea Snegur and Chairman of the Belarussian 
parliament Mechyslaw Hryb and Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
scheduled for Thursday in Kishinev [Chisinau]. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, chairman of the Belarussian 
parliamentary commission on ethnic relations Mikhail Slemnev 
pointed out that the Belarussian legislation on citizenship 
allows ethnic Belarussians who have not gained citizenships of 
other countries to get the Belarussian citizenship by 
registering in Belarussian embassies in these countries. 
  He also said that during a two-day visit of the Belarussian 
leaders, including apart from the meeting with President Snegur 
talks with the Moldovan head of parliament and prime minister it 
is also planned to consider the implementation of the 
Belarussian-Moldovan treaty on friendship and cooperation. It 
is expected that heads of governments of the two countries will 
sign a trade economic agreement. 
  At a meeting between Snegur and presidents of the Ukrainian, 
Belarussian, and Moldovan Academies of Sciences before Hryb's 
and Kebich's visit to Kishinev, Snegur said that the liquidation 
of barriers between republics of the former Soviet Union and the 
restoration of the signle economic space is one of the main 
goals facing leaders of the CIS states. 
  The Moldovan president described the meeting in Kishinev 
between the presidents of the Academies of Sciences of the three 
republics as a decent example for politicians who "should join 
their efforts to overcome the crisis in relations between the 
young states." 
  The program of international contacts of the Moldovan leader 
includes Snegur's meeting with Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel scheduled for early June in Kishinev. 
  Snegur told journalists on Wednesday that the Republic 
attributes great significance to the visit. 
  Snegur said that, as a result of the talks, documents will 
be 
signed "which would promote relations between the two states." 
According to the president, soon Moldova will open its embassy 
in Ankara. 
  IF Note: Among documents planned for the signing is an 
agreement on cooperation between Moldova and Turkey, a number of 
projects to modernize the agricultural production, the touristic 
industry, Moldovan telecommunications. It is expected that 
Demirel and Snegur will visit villages populated by the Gagauzes.

<F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Pasechnik: "Dniester Breakthrough"] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau -- Local and foreign observers described 
the meeting which took place on the eve of the May Day 
celebrations in Tiraspol as a most significant political step, a 
kind of breakthrough, in resolving the very complex problem of 
the Dniester Region. It resulted in a statement signed by 
President of Moldavia [Moldova] Mircea Snegur and Dniester 
Region leader Igor Smirnov. 
  The document notes that a new sociopolitical situation has 
now developed, which is an important prerequisite for the 
successful resolution of this protracted crisis, which has 
inflicted colossal damage on the economy and claimed many lives. 
The sides emphasized their exclusive commitment to peaceful 
means of resolving the conflict based on the existing social, 
economic, and political realities. A firm intention was 
expressed to take into consideration the CSCE mission's 
recommendations, the Russian Federation's views, and the 
positive experience gained from securing peace settlements in 
other regions. 
  At the meeting, in which a CSCE mission representative, R.S. 
Semuel [name as transliterated], and the Russian president's 
plenipotentiary, Ambassador V. Vasev, took the role of 
mediators, the sides agreed to begin the process of negotiations 
immediately and without any preconditions on a whole range of 
issues of mutual interest. Among the most important of these 
questions is, of course, that of determining the Dniester 
Region's legal status as a state. Moreover, the statement noted 
that it is necessary to remove all barriers preventing the 
normal utilization of commercial and economic and social and 
cultural ties, and to ensure their revival and development. The 
sides agreed on the need for a step-by-step program to create 
and implement legal state relations and in general to implement 
mutual agreements. 
  It is hard to overestimate the importance of the document, 
which has finally come into being after many years' bitter 
confrontation and after the bloody armed conflict of the summer 
of 1992. But it is, nevertheless, no accident that one Chisinau 
newspaper immediately described it as a protocol of intent. 
Certainly good intent. However, only goodwill, realism, and 
persistence on the part of politicians can implement it, meeting 
the keen expectations of people on both sides of the Dniester.

  [Text] We have entered a new, more positive period in our 
cooperation. This was a statement made by Nicholas Burns, the 
U.S. National Security Council's senior director, at his meeting 
with Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch on 5 May. 
The guest is leading his country's representative economic 
delegation that has been visiting Ukraine for several days now. 
  In the course of the conversation, Ivan Plyushch described 
the situation that had formed in Ukraine. The arrival of this 
delegation in our country, in his view, is another step taken 
along the path toward further building mutually beneficial ties 
of partnership with the United States of America. The United 
States can play an important part in promoting the settlement of 
the issues that Ukraine is now faced with, said Ivan Plyushch. 
  I know, Nicholas Burns replied, that President Bill Clinton 
believes America and Ukraine have entered a new, more positive 
period in bilateral relations. Whereas we used to pay more 
attention to eliminating the nuclear weapons deployed in 
Ukraine, we are now making the emphasis on larger-scale economic 
relations. A few months ago, our president made a resolute 
decision that we should develop a new and productive 
relationship with Ukraine in the economic sphere. The U.S. 
President promises that this summer will see the beginning of an 
U.S.-Ukrainian Enterprise Fund which is to lend money to private 
enterprises in Ukraine. Your state is now our fourth largest 
world partner in terms of the size of our economic assistance, 
which once again emphasizes that Ukraine is a country of great 
importance to the United States, Nicholas Burns, U.S. National 
Security Council senior director, said.

  [Text] At the talks conducted in Kiev between the Ukrainian 
Government and an economic delegation from the U.S., Ukraine 
suggested that part of the $350 million allocated by the U.S. 
should be used as security for receiving credit from a major 
foreign bank. As Ukraine's Economics Minister, Roman Shpek, 
said during the talks, Kiev is not prepared to "use $350 million 
in the near future." 
  The leadership of Ukraine's Cabinet criticized Washington 
for 
having advanced too many conditions for granting concrete 
economic aid. According to Deputy Premier Valentin Landik, 
under American proposals the granting of $95 million to support 
private enterprise will become possible only if leasing as a 
means of privatizing property is given up. 
  According to American experts, leasing may hinder the 
"voucher privatization," which they view as the most progressive 
method of reforming property. 
  Landik urged members of the U.S. delegation to refrain from 
advancing conditions for the granting of aid, and to stop their 
calls for "starting reforms." 
  As he said, the lowering of inflation to 5.7 pct and the 
start of privatization indicate that reforms in Ukraine have 
already begun, and that concrete support for them is necessary. 
  During the talks American negotiators also insisted that 
Ukraine should introduce a market rate for its karbovanets in 
relation to hard currencies. Landik for his part declared that 
the state will continue to regulate the karbovanets rate till 
the crisis is overcome. 
  The two delegations are led by the Ukrainian Deputy Premier, 
Valentin Landik, and by Nicholas Burns, a senior official from 
the U.S. National Security Council.

TASS] 
  [Text] Kiev 5 May TASS -- We have entered another, more 
positive stage of our cooperation, according to Nicholas Burns, 
senior director of the U.S. National Security Council and an 
adviser to President Bill Clinton. 
  Burns heads a U.S. economic delegation, which arrived in 
Kiev 
a few days ago for talks with Ukrainian officials on how to 
apply $350 million in aid. 
  On Thursday, Burns met Ukrainian Parliament Chairman Ivan 
Plyushch. The speaker informed the American guest about the 
current situation in the former Soviet Republic. He described 
the visit by such a representative delegation as another step 
towards further development of mutually beneficial partnership 
between the two countries. The United States can contribute 
considerably to solution of problems currently facing Ukraine, 
Plyushch stressed. 
  Burns said the present visit had been mostly focused on 
exchange of opinions about economic cooperation between the 
United States and Ukraine. This issue was tackled during 
meetings with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and government 
ministers. 
  According to the U.S. official, President Clinton believes 
the two countries entered a new stage of bilateral relations. 
The previous stage concentrated on dismantling of Ukraine's 
nuclear weapons inherited from the former Soviet Union. At 
present, the emphasis is laid on closer and more extensive 
economic ties. "To the United States, Ukraine is seen as one of 
the most important countries in Europe," Burns said. 
  He insisted the former Soviet republic speed up economic 
reform if it wanted more aid in future. "The Ukrainian 
Government and parliament and the society at large want to 
achieve economic reform. But we believe the progress has 
Gorbachev to go further. Much greater progress has to be made," 
Burns told a news conference. 
  The U.S. delegation head called on ministers to move more 
quickly in implementing an ambitious privatization programme and 
creating a better climate for trade. 
  "The United States would like to lead an international 
effort 
to provide help to Ukraine with its economic reform programme," 
he pointed out. The combined sum pledged by the U.S. to the 
newly-independent state puts Ukraine behind only Israel, Egypt, 
and Russia in terms of U.S. foreign aid. 
  Among other projects, the United States will print 
privatization certificates to be issued to all Ukrainian 
citizens in July and set up an enterprise fund to give loans to 
small businesses.

Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of the European Union 
Commission and commissar for external economic affairs of the 
European Commissions, who is on a visit to our country at the 
invitation of the foreign affairs minister to familiarize 
himself with the situation in Ukraine and to find out about the 
course of reforms. A conversation took place in the course of 
which a wide variety of issues relating to cooperation between 
Ukraine and the EEC was raised. Ukraine attaches significant 
importance to the development of cooperation with the European 
Union, said President Kravchuk. We seek to have good relations 
with every country on the continent. 
  I am happy that work on preparation for the signing of an 
agreement between Ukraine and the EEC on partnership and 
cooperation is over. This cooperation will be on the basis of 
temporary accords. 
  President Kravchuk expressed the wish that the agreement 
should be signed as early as the beginning of June. This, he 
said, is necessitated by our economic and political problems.

  [Text] The European Union [EU] agrees to provide financial 
assistance to build two new reactors in Ukraine, on one 
condition, however: that all of the Chernobyl nuclear electric 
power station's generating sets are closed down. This was a 
statement made at a news conference in Strasbourg, held by five 
of the European Parliament's most influential party groupings 
that united in a campaign for the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station to close down. It was announced that 100 million ECU 
[European currency unit] would be allocated by the EURATOM 
[European Atomic Energy Community] organization. Some of the 
money will be provided from the TACIS [Technical Aid to the 
Commonwealth of Independent States] program and by the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Members of the European 
Parliament stressed that the G-7 member states would make a 
considerable contribution.

  [Text] Kiev 5 May TASS -- Ukraine should have made great 
contribution to environmental security in Europe, if it closed 
down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. 
  Such was the position which visiting representatives of the 
G-7 countries expressed at a meeting with Yuriy Kostenko, 
Ukrainian minister for environmental protection, on Thursday [5 
May]. 
  If the Chernobyl nuclear power plant keeps on functioning, 
it 
will thus pose a permanent threat not only to Ukraine, but also 
to other countries of the world, they emphasized. 
  According to Kostenko, his ministry has always been the only 
state body to consistently demand that the Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant be closed down as soon as possible. 
  The measures, which are being taken now to reinforce the 
plant's security, will hardly suffice to prevent radioactive 
pollution of the area in case of another accident, he said. 
  Representatives of the so-called "pro-nuclear" lobby, who 
exercise much influence at all levels of power throughout the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, put up a most fierce 
resistance, he explained. They insist on a constant build-up in 
nuclear capacities, gambling on the fact that Ukraine has now to 
face the problem of insufficient power supplies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the Crimean </F>
Tatar Majlis, by HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent Natalya Filipchuk 
in Kiev; place and date not given: "It Is Not Alms That We 
Need, but Recognition"] 
  [Text] President L. Kravchuk's edict "On Measures for 
Commemorating the Victims of Deportation From the Crimea" was, 
at first glance, timed for a specific date. On 18 May, 50 years 
ago, the "resettlement" of Crimean Tatars, as well as of 
Armenians, Bulgarians, and Greeks, started.... However, some 
politicians also saw in the edict official Kiev's political 
reaction to recent events in the Crimea. In particular, for the 
first time, in an important official document, the Crimean Tatar 
Majlis figured as a plenipotentiary representative body. Its 
chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev was appointed as deputy chairman of 
the Organizing Committee for Preparing and Holding the 
Remembrance Program. Mustafa aga [Tatar polite form of address] 
arrived in Kiev to take part in the first meeting of the 
committee. 
  [Dzhemilev] I think that, indeed, the edict was to a certain 
extent a response to the recent actions by Crimean Republic's 
President Meshkov, who openly violates the constitutions of 
Ukraine and of the Crimea, as well as accords between the 
Crimean administration and the Ukrainian leadership. We are 
generally surprised that Kiev has been waiting for such a long 
time and, when it does respond to Meshkov's illegal edicts, it 
is on paper only. I understand Kiev's striving to avoid 
confrontation. However, if one proceeds along the road of 
compliance, this may, in the long run, lead to such a conflict 
that, by comparison, the troubles, which might result from 
decisive actions on the part of the Ukrainian leadership, will 
look like minor things. 
  [Filipchuk] In accordance with your forecasts, will such 
uncertain relations between Kiev and Simferopol prevail for a 
long time? 
  [Dzhemilev] The situation in the Crimea largely depends upon 
its administration. It is clear that Meshkov feels confident, 
since specific Russian statesmen, who are interested in 
maintaining instability on the peninsula, are backing him in 
pursuance of their own interests, in particular with regard to 
the Black Sea Fleet. Kiev's indecisiveness only inspires 
chauvinists both in the Crimea and in Russia. I hope that, 
eventually, the silence of the Ukrainian leadership will end. 
  A different development of events is also possible: If 
Meshkov's Moscow coaches suggest that he pursue a different and 
more cautious policy and if they promise that there will be no 
territorial claims upon Ukraine. 
  [Filipchuk] How will the events develop if the Crimean 
administration gets the Crimean Tatars to their side? 
  [Dzhemilev] As things stand at present, this is not 
realistic. Even the fact that 14 of our representatives were 
elected to the parliament does not mean that we found 
understanding; this is the result of our acts of civil 
disobedience. Meshkov himself, who was actually against ethnic 
quotas in the parliament, stated in the parliament the next day 
after the elections that he did not recognize the Crimean Tatar 
Majlis and that Bagrov's parliament had made many stupid things 
(he meant, in particular, the quotas), and called upon the new 
parliament to "resolve" those problems. 
  A few days ago, Meshkov's mediator spoke to us -- wouldn't 
we 
agree to meet with the president at his invitation. If 
President Meshkov wants to meet with us as with private persons, 
because he does not recognize the Majlis' powers, then does it 
really make sense? 
  Incidentally, we have already been offered rewards for 
supporting a specific candidate for the post of chairman of the 
Crimean parliament. However, it is not alms that we need, but 
full recognition of the rights of the Crimean Tatars. 
  [Filipchuk] Do official Russian representatives seek 
contacts with you? 
  [Dzhemilev] There recently was a proposal from [deputy 
chairman of the Council of Ministers Sergey] Shakhray to meet 
with representatives of the Majlis. Readiness was even 
expressed to come to the Crimea, if representatives of the 
Majlis are unable to go to Moscow. Our doors are open to 
anybody. However, before we hold negotiations with official 
figures of foreign states, especially under today's conditions, 
we want to coordinate this with the leadership of our state. 
  Russia does really seek contacts with us, but for what 
purpose? When, in 1991, they wanted to officially recognize us 
and even showed us a Russian Supreme Council's draft decree to 
that effect, there was just one "request" for the Crimean 
Tatars: To agree to the cancellation of the 1954 decree on the 
transfer of the Crimea to Ukraine's jurisdiction. As regards 
Crimean Tatars, very many illegal acts against them have been 
perpetrated throughout their history, but it would be best to 
start with 1783: Russia's unlawful annexation of the Crimea. 
That was the end of our "friendship." Nobody mentioned 
recognition any more after that. 
  However, the trouble is that Ukraine delays official 
recognition of the Majlis in precisely the same way, fearing the 
reaction on the part of the Crimea and Russia. At the same 
time, we in the Crimea feel ourselves more Ukrainian than 
Ukrainians themselves. 
  [Filipchuk] Incidentally, neither representatives of Rukh, 
nor of Ukraine's democratic parties have been elected to the 
Crimean parliament. Do they, today, see their allies in you? 
  [Dzemilev] Our representatives will primarily defend the 
interests of Crimean Tatars, and these interests largely 
coincide with the interests of pro-Ukrainian parties. We see 
our self-determination as the revival of our national 
territorial autonomy within Ukraine and are categorically 
against a revision of borders. We are grateful to Ukraine for 
agreeing to finance the return of deported peoples to their 
historical land. Although there also are problems here: The 
allocated funds first get to the administration of the republic 
and not to the Crimean Tatars. The administration is the least 
interested party here. Our compatriots from Uzbekistan, for 
example, cannot sell their houses in order to return to the 
Crimea, because the legislation of that state is an obstacle. 
Obviously, Ukraine might somehow, on a bilateral basis, 
coordinate this issue. It would also be logical if Russia also 
allocated certain funds for the return of deported people, as it 
considers itself to be a successor to the USSR. 
  The correspondent's note. On 18 May, Ukraine and the Crimean 
Tatars will commemorate victims of the deportation. It is a 
just and timely measure. However, the Crimean Tatars hope that 
this will not limit the care about deported people. Over the 
first quarter of 1994, just 36 billion [monetary unit not 
specified] out of the 148 billion set aside for the return of 
deported people to the Crimea was received; in the second 
quarter -- just 35 billion out of 124 billion. Out of the 40 
billion allocated for social needs of the victims, only 5 
billion was received. A few days ago, Crimean Tatars occupied 
by force the building of the former mosque -- presently used for 
storing the Black Sea Fleet archives. They virtually forced 
Admiral Baltin to make a written obligation to vacate the 
building by 15 May. So that on 18 May, a rally-requiem could be 
held in the mosque....

  [Text] Kiev, 5 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "Relations between 
Ukraine and Crimea should be built on the basis of equality and 
mutual benefit. And this will be the main topic of my meeting 
with President Yuriy Meshkov in Simferopol 7 May," Ukraine's 
Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskyy told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent today. 
  Yesterday's conversation behind closed doors with Crimea's 
Vice President Yevgeniy Saburov served as a kind of "impetus" 
for the trip. Yefim Zvyagilskyy was satisfied with its outcome. 
He was heartened by the fact that in response to the question: 
"Where do Crimea's loyalties lie?" Yevgeniy Saburov said 
unequivocally: "With Ukraine." "It was only after this that I 
decided to meet the president of Crimea," Yefim Zvyagilskyy 
stressed.

<F P=106> [News conference by Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahkilskyy </F>
at UNIAN in Kiev on 5 May] 
  [Text] Kiev -- At a news conference at UNIAN on 5 May, 
Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahilskyy answered questions from 
that news agency's journalists and representatives of other mass 
media. 
  [UNIAN] With your support, the approved 1994 budget does not 
contain a deficit. The National Bank of Ukraine estimates that 
the deficit in the first quarter of this year came to over eight 
trillion [karbovantsi] against the background of the whole of 
last year's deficit of 9.5 trillion. Are you still in favor of 
the idea of a budget without a deficit? If not, how soon can we 
expect emission [emisiya] as a source of deficit elimination and 
of what size? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] To have a budget without a deficit is an 
aspiration of every state. I backed the no-deficit budget in 
the first quarter in order to see whether it would be possible 
to lose money gradually. Given the complex economic situation, 
a way out is strict control over the budget's revenue and 
expenditure. The policy of a no-deficit budget, in my view, is 
justifiable. However, we noted in the Law on the Budget that we 
would make corrections as the result of each quarter. This is 
what we are doing. I think that an analysis of the first 
quarter's results will be ready by 20 May and will be submitted 
for consideration by the Supreme Council on 20-25 May. I am 
convinced there will be no emission in the near future. 
  [UNIAN] Subduing hyperinflation is considered to be your 
greatest achievement. Is not a 38 percent slump in production 
in the first quarter too high a price to pay for this? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] That depends on how you look at the production 
slump. From the standpoint of the generation of electricity on 
Ukraine, for instance, the slump in that sphere's production is 
18 percent. 
  I cannot trust statistics. There is an instruction and we 
are in the process of making an in-depth analysis. Considering 
the list of other items, there is a 1- to 3-percent increase in 
certain articles. It can also be said today that our steel 
workers are gradually raising the volume of production too, 
which could be accounted for by the fact that many enterprises 
have been demanding larger quotas and licences on top of the 
state contract or state order, to reequip themselves 
technologically, using proceeds from the goods sold. Analyzing 
the data on the rate of production growth in metallurgy in March 
compared with February 1994, the figures are follows: The 
extraction of iron ore rose by 3.8 percent, the production of 
cast iron by half a percent, steel by six percent and steel pipe 
by 2.3 percent. True, though: Ready rolled metal was down 2.8 
percent. You are right in saying that there is a production 
decline in machine building, etc. However, the production of 
foodstuffs was also up. 
  [UNIAN correspondent] Ukraine's legislation guarantees the 
repatriation of profit for foreign investors. In practice, 
however, where can investors who have set up production in 
Ukraine and are earning karbovantsi, repatriate their income? 
When will the work of the currency exchange resume? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] I have instructed our professionals to work 
out 
that issue and find ways of settling it. There are many 
options, but what is most important now is to find one 
acceptable and beneficial both for Ukraine and the investors 
themselves. We are working on this problem and I think it will 
be resolved in the very near future. 
  I would like to emphasize that the work of the Ukrainian 
Interbank Currency Exchange [UICE] was only halted rather than 
having been closed down. But should there be an attempt to 
resume the activity of the UICE forcibly, I shall resign. I 
believe that the work of the currency exchange at the 
transitional period of crisis is only good for a small number of 
individuals, but detrimental to millions of ordinary people. 
  [UNIAN] Of what will financial and credit support for 
enterprises, to be provided according to the resolution "On 
Urgent Measures To Overcome the Payments Crisis and Normalize 
the Work of Enterprises" signed by you on 4 May, consist? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] The government will only be granting financial 
and credit support to the enterprises that produce competitive 
goods and have a sales market (Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers, 
in Yefim Zvyahilskyy's words, has already gathered the 
information required from ministries and departments, in order 
to identify those enterprises), whereas the enterprises that do 
have a sales market will only be able to receive money having a 
realistic clear-up and production realignment program. 
  [UNIAN] Has the concept of a future monetary reform been 
developed? What will it be like, a parallel or confiscatory one? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] A new banknote factory has been commissioned 
in Ukraine. The money is very good. We can print an unlimited 
amount of it and also some for other countries. As for the 
reform, a working group has been set up and there will by all 
means be the introduction of the hryvnya. The issue of banning 
the circulation of foreign currency in Ukraine, which does not 
apply to the Ukrainian karbovanets, is also under 
consideration. This move will not be to everyone's liking but 
it would be justifiable. This is one of the elements of hryvnya 
introduction. 
  [UNIAN] You said on the eve of the elections to the Supreme 
Council: "The government officials that stood and failed to get 
elected, have to resign from civil service". Does it mean now 
that over twenty highly qualified bureaucrats have to go? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] This is a matter of personal conscience and 
depends on the officials themselves. When Labor Minister 
Mykhaylo Kaskevych, a professional I greatly respect, came and 
wrote a letter of resignation, I could do nothing but endorse 
it. Others, however, have not yet written anything... Although 
I have told Economy Minister Roman Shpek about a few of his 
deputies who failed to reach parliament, no pressure can be 
applied to those people. This, I repeat, is a matter of their 
conscience. 
  [UNIAN] In connection with various reports of your 
participation -- and that of your relatives -- in 
entrepreneurial structures, are you and your relatives now 
prepared to fill in a declaration of incomes? What is in your 
way? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] I filled in such a declaration when I decided 
to stand for a member of the new parliament. As Yefim 
Zvyahilskyy, I have taken part in no commercial structure. Nor 
am I taking part in them. I shall fill in the declaration, when 
need be. The participation of the Zasyadko mine in Donetsk, 
where I was director, in the institution of the first Ukrainian 
international bank, cannot be regarded as personal commercial 
activity. 
  [UNIAN] There is an ever-increasing amount of talk about 
wider-ranging regional economic independence. Where do you think 
is the boundary the regions cannot be allowed to overstep? What 
are the main differences on the development of the Crimean 
Peninsula you and Crimean Vice Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov 
have? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] On my initiative, I met Yevgeniy Saburov on 4 
May. First of all, I asked Saburov whether he could see Crimea 
within Ukraine. The vice prime minister said: "So, and only so." 
Afterwards, there began negotiations, with the agriculture, 
economy, and external economic relations ministers taking part 
in them. In the course of the conversation, I voiced the 
opinion that Crimean presidential decrees in many respects 
contradicted the Constitution of Ukraine and that working in 
this manner was, of course, no longer possible. The Crimean 
side, in its turn, expressed understanding that one could have 
done without decrees in settling many issues. 
  Yevgeniy Saburov also acknowledged the reasonability of 
arguments by the chairman of the board of the National Bank 
[NBU], Viktor Yushchenko. I also emphasized: "A state can only 
have one national bank." The only thing that I guaranteed for 
the Crimeans, was transferring financial aid from any state by a 
purposive allocation to Crimea without delay: The money that 
will be received by the NBU, will in an hour's time be 
transferred to Crimea down to the cent." We reached 
understanding that actions by the Crimean Government should not 
affect the interests of Ukraine. We agreed on a meeting between 
Ukraine's Government delegation and the Crimean president on 7 
May. It is not worthwhile to stage confrontation. It is better 
to lend assistance to Crimea in resolving its problems. My 
opinion is that the decision only to provide Ukrainian language 
textbooks for Crimean schools is ill-considered. 
  [UNIAN] What is your attitude towards the Black Sea Fleet 
issue? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] The government is preparing specific proposals 
on this issue. This problem cannot be left unresolved, which is 
why all options are being made ready, including the possibility 
of rent. A preliminary accord has been reached on a meeting in 
the very near future with the head of Russia's government, 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, to work out all contentious issues on the 
Black Sea Fleet. 
  Yefim Zvyahilskyy then answered questions from 
representatives of other mass media. Answering the question 
whether Ukraine would accept IMF conditions for the receipt of 
credits, Yefim Zvyahilskyy said he would not agree to the 
condition of cancelling the fixed currency exchange rate. "We, 
by all means, shall come to this but it will not happen in 1994. 
The thing is that once we free the rate, we shall have all 
prices for food, housing, gas, and electricity rising 
several-fold. We then will have to raise wages and pensions 
without, however, having the money for this in the budget. This 
is exactly why this road cannot be taken or the economy will 
crumble." 
  As for the question on the attitude towards dividing powers 
between the president and the prime minister and his personal 
preferences for any presidential candidate, Yefim Zvyahilskyy 
declined to answer. "I am an industrialist and a businessman. I 
am not aware of politics although, of course, I know what is 
what in it." He also spoke in favor of a professional 
parliament and pointed out that the Cabinet of Ministers would 
be formed. As for his personal future, he said he cold not 
envisage any tragedy for himself. "I shall be a rank and file 
people's deputy," he said. "However, if the president deems it 
necessary for me to remain in the Cabinet of Ministers, I shall 
remain," Yefim Zvyahilskyy told the UNIAN correspondent.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev, 5 May -- "There is no crisis in Ukraine. 
There is a slump in production. Those who talk of crisis are 
simply following fashion," Ukraine's acting Prime Minister 
Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said at a news conference today. He backed 
up his viewpoint with facts. Inflation, which last year took 
the catastrophic form of hyperinflation reaching 91 percent in 
December, was 5.7 percent in March of this year. Prices for 
basic foodstuffs are almost static. The gradual reduction of 
bank credit interest rates has begun. The decision that hard 
currency must be sold at a regulated exchange rate has made it 
possible for a proportion of subsidies and allowances which 
exporters received from the state to be recovered and for 
inflation on the domestic market to be curbed. 
  Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said that the government has moved away 
from general discussions about the need to return all hard 
currency earned from exports from Ukraine to specific measures. 
Checks have been carried out to ascertain whether the hard 
currency receipts of all exporters have been declared fully and 
promptly. A control system "customs-bank" has been devised and 
is being introduced. This gives a real picture of hard currency 
from exports coming into Ukraine literally every day. 
  And we are doing this at accelerated rates, since Ukraine in 
January alone failed to receive more than $14 million, about 10 
billion Russian rubles, and also large sums of other currencies, 
the acting Prime Minister stressed. But today we know by name 
everyone who failed to return currency on time, and we shall 
take the toughest measures against them. 
  Measures are being taken to ensure complete and punctual 
payment of taxes into the budget. In January to April alone, 
evaded taxes were recovered and fines were imposed in the amount 
of 1.441 trillion karbovantsi. This work is continuing. In 
this way, one of the reasons for the delay in remittance of pay 
to the budget-financed organizations and in financing of social 
programs is being eliminated in particular. 
  A fundamentally new mechanism of settling accounts with the 
producers of agricultural output has make it possible, without 
resorting to emission of money, to supply agriculture with fuel 
and lubricants, seed, and fertilizer at acceptable prices. This 
in turn has made it possible to carry out the spring field work 
without substantial disruption and lay the foundations of the 
future harvest. 
  Yukhym Zvyahilskyy considers that these "measures are 
ensuring control of the economic situation not by means of 
vulgar administrative state interference in everything, but by 
means of economic levers." Now the opportunity has appeared to 
tackle nonpayments, one of the major problems to date. The main 
essence of these measures consists in lowering enterprises' tax 
burden, preparing for the transition to tax on profits and not 
on incomes, targeting support for those who produce output for 
which there is a market, liberalizing exports and the protection 
of home producers, and also lowering the bank rates. 
  Yukhym Zvyahilskyy announced one other piece of news: The 
decision has been made to increase the regulated rate of the 
karbovanets to 13,100 karbovantsi to one U.S. dollar.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Popovkin, chief of the department dealing </F>
with shaping socioeconomic strategy: "Ukrainian Economy: Are 
All Resources Exhausted"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] During the first quarter of 
1994, in comparison with the same period last year, the national 
income was reduced by 36 percent, the industrial output by more 
than 38 percent (machine building industry by 47 percent; 
chemical industry by 45 percent; light industry by 100 percent: 
ready made garments by 60 percent, and shoes by 66 percent). 
  The general production of consumer goods fell by some 40 
percent, while nonfoodstuff goods by 45 percent. 
  Production of essential products of the black metallurgy 
shrunk by 30-70 percent. Let us not forget that over 1993 it 
fell by 20-40 percent. We can see how the entire sector -- 
producing essential products for the machine building industry 
-- that is the basis for the technological progress is dying. 
The development of transport is unthinkable without metal 
products. 
  Cuts in production in the fuel-energetic sector is 
continuing. Coal extraction fell by 16 percent, production in 
the oil processing industry -- by 45-60 percent. The production 
of electrical energy decreased by 17 percent. 
  In our opinion, skyrocketing prices were and continue to be 
the key reason for this critical situation. They limit the 
demand and opportunities of trading in products. Despite the 
catastrophic reduction in production, the warehouses and trading 
facilities continue to amass huge amounts of unsold products. 
For example, this especially concerns the production of 
furniture and tiles, 70 percent of which are not in demand. 
Given the reduction in the volume of crediting within the 
framework of the governmental antiinflation program, mutual 
debts of enterprises considerably increased. Only over 
January-February 1994, the general volume of debts between 
enterprises and organizations of Ukraine increased by one third 
and exceeded 300 trillion karbovanetses. The mutual nonpayments 
of debts increased by 2.6 times. A specific proportion of loss 
making enterprises increased from 16 to 24 percent. 
  Despite the stable prices on imported energy resources, the 
increase in wholesale prices in industry (by 54 percent since 
the beginning of the year ), prices for construction and 
installation work (in 2.3 times by the fourth quarter of 1993), 
and retail prices is continuing. The emission of money is in 
full swing. 
  The crisis in the investment sector is deepening. The 
production of the most important types of building materials 
fell to 40-70 percent, capital investments and costs of 
construction and installation work was reduced by 37-38 percent, 
and the volume of contractor work -- by almost a half. 
  The Ukrainian transportation system is experiencing a total 
crisis. Due to a reduction in production and extremely high 
transportation tariffs, cargo shipments by vehicles was reduced 
by 55 percent and by railroads -- by 65 percent. 
  In comparison with the first quarter of 1993, the volume of 
retail turnover fell almost twice. Figures representing cuts in 
average wages in the state sector of the national economy look 
extremely absurd. Notably, the highest wage was registered in 
the banking and social insurance sector -- it exceeded the 
average wage three times and was 3.2-times higher than the wage 
of a researcher. People, who produce material and spiritual 
values, have been totally excluded from priority compensations. 
Motives for conscientious work have been wrecked. However, 
very soon we will not have anything that could be redistributed. 
  The situation demands the adoption of extraordinary 
measures, 
first and foremost, regarding a decrease in prices to liberalize 
the consumers' demand, the lessening of the role of the state in 
the regulation of prices for essential goods to raise work 
motivation, correct and stabilize the national currency rate, 
and liberalize the taxation policy. 
  Apparently, the government is convinced that both the 
national resources and people's patience are inexhaustible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Mykhaylovich Karasyk, Ukraine's </F>
minister of agriculture and food, by Viktor Kozoris; place and 
date not given: "Professionalism Must Unite Us"] 
  [Text] Minister of Agriculture and Food Yuriy Mykhaylovich 
Karasyk became the first Supreme Council People's Deputy from 
the Cherkassk Oblast. He balloted for the legislature seat in 
the Cherkassk constituency No. 427 in which the runoff was held 
on 3 April. When the results of all the Ukrainian runoffs were 
known, our reporter met with People's Deputy Yuriy Mykhaylovich 
Karasyk. 
  [Kozoris] Yuriy Mykhaylovich, I prepared a traditional 
question for you: With what are you going to begin your 
deputy's activities? 
  [Karasyk] I have already met with some deputies-agrarians. 
We are drafting a package of documents which will foster the 
work of the agricultural sector. First of all, these are 
documents on taxation because a value-added tax is a regular 
element in the processes of production, processing, and 
realization of agricultural products. In fact, taxation in the 
agricultural sector should encourage neither production, nor the 
budget, but the producer and the consumer. Experience shows 
that it should be flexible, and dependent on volumes of 
production and sales of products. However, our taxation is 
stable, agricultural products are not in demand (because people 
cannot buy them), and this triggers a drop in production. 
  The second block of issues is as follows. People's Deputy 
Viktor Martynovych Kalnyk, deputy minister of economy, and I are 
drafting a price formulating mechanism. It is closely connected 
with taxation. The third package regards our credit policy. I 
can say that a single document on taxation, crediting, and price 
formation is being drafted. This package also includes 
proposals on the banking sector, first and foremost, on the 
setting up of a land bank which will service enterprises and 
persons representing all forms of ownership in the production 
sector. 
  Now about the work in the new legislature. We know how many 
socialists and Rukh members it has. I can only pin hopes on 
that -- irrespective of what parties and movements are 
represented in the Supreme Council -- their representatives will 
be sane enough to unite their efforts on economic issues. 
Professionalism must unite us. 
  [Kozoris] The new legislature will be professional. Will you 
drop your ministerial post or unite your ministerial and 
legislative work? 
  [Karasyk] It is up to the Supreme Council. A new government 
will also be formed in line with the Supreme Council's 
decisions. If I suit the governmental team as minister of 
agriculture and food, then I will consult my voters in what post 
I will be of more use both to them and to the state. 
  [Kozoris] Many newly elected deputies said during the 
election campaigns that they will come to the legislature with 
their teams. Have you your own team in the Supreme Council? 
  [Karasyk] Our team will be the most numerous among the 
ministries in the new legislature. Five newly elected deputies 
come from the central state bodies: My three deputy ministers, 
the head of the concern "Ukragrotekhservis," and myself. 
Therefore, if you ask about a team, we have it. For example, 
Oleksandr Borovyk, chairman of the All-Ukrainian Council of 
Kolkhozes [KSP], KSP Chairman from Kiev Danilenko, and a range 
of other leaders of agricultural enterprises. In my opinion, we 
have the proper agrarian team. 
  [Kozoris] Is newly elected People's Deputy Oleksandr 
Tkachenko, former Ukrainian minister of agriculture, also a 
member of your team? 
  [Karasyk] In my opinion, Tkachenko suits our team 
professionally. We could have different political standpoints, 
however, from the point of view of professionalism, he should be 
a member of the agrarian team. 
  [Kozoris] Why did I ask you this question? Currently, some 
politicians issue statements regarding the existence of at least 
two groups of agrarians -- Karasyk's and Tkachenko's -- in the 
legislature. 
  [Karasyk] This will be our greatest problem. If agrarians 
begin setting up separate groups, this will cause a deadlock. 
Then we should lay down the office not to make people laugh. 
Given the current situation, we should drop our ambitions and 
assess objectively the life, and political and economic 
developments. Eventually, legislative deputies should work and 
not rally. 
  [Kozoris] Yuriy Mykhaylovich, you are an expert of, let us 
simply put it, the old Supreme Council. It also did not suffer 
from a lack of kolkhoz chairmen and experienced agrarians. Why 
did their activity not have a positive effect on our 
agricultural sector? 
  [Karasyk] Experience shows that the Supreme Council only 
dealt with adopting laws, the executive bodies did not live up 
to our expectations, and we missed the mechanism of the 
implementation of laws. I believe that the laws should be 
adopted together with a mechanism for their implementation, and 
they should be economically grounded to avoid the adoption of 
populist laws. It is better to tell people the truth, however, 
this truth should make people believe in the necessity of 
adopting corresponding laws. I do not blame the old Supreme 
Council, because, to blame, one should first try to work there. 
We aimed to become Supreme Council deputies to work. 
  [Kozoris] When can we expect real changes in the Ukrainian 
agrarian sector? 
  [Karasyk] I believe that in two or three years, the 
situation 
in the agrarian sector will become stable.

  [Text] The state of emergency declared in Kazakhstan's 
capital Almaty on April 29 due to the shortage of fuel was 
lifted on 4 May. As the Deputy Mayor Yakov Zayts, who leads a 
commission on emergencies, has told INTERFAX, there was fuel 
rationing in the city on 29 April for all enterprises and 
organizations not involved in vital urban services. 
  In his words, the city's administration were forced to take 
extreme measures because of poor oil supply, slashed because of 
the consumer debt. He reported that the debts had been 
partially repaid at the expense of credits. According to his 
information, a number of state oil refineries have already sent 
about 3000 tonnes of gasoline to Almaty. He noted that "a small 
fuel reserve" has been created in the city, and "the situation 
is returning to normal."

  [Text] Military cooperation with Russia is the strategic 
policy of the Kazakh Armed Forces, Kazakh Defense Minister 
Sagadat Nurmagambetov stated at a press conference in Alma-Ata 
[Almaty] dedicated to the second anniversary of the Kazakh Army. 
  Nurmagambetov stressed that the most difficult period of 
renewal of the Kazakh Armed Forces was over. The Army has been 
equipped with personnel, uniform and technical means. 
Nurmagambetov pointed out that Kazakhstan was the last among 
the CIS states to place the troops stationed on its own 
territory under its jurisdiction. 
  Nurmagambetov said that earlier Kazakhstan had stood for a 
single CIS or Russian-Kazakh Army. He emphasized that several 
agreements on implementation of the treaty on military 
cooperation between Russia and Kazakhstan would be signed in 
late May during the Russian governmental delegation's visit to 
Alma-Ata. 
  Nurmagambetov announced that an agreement on Russia's 
lending 
the Sary-Shagan anti-missile training ground in Central 
Kazakhstan was being worked on. He said Kazakhstan conditioned 
the lending with education of Kazakh military specialists in 
Russia. He stressed that Sary-Shagan would not be a Russian 
military base since there would be no Russian troops. 
  No establishment of any military bases in Kazakhstan was 
expected, Nurmagambetov stated. The strategic armed forces 
stationed in Kazakhstan will be withdrawn from it by 2000. The 
withdrawal has already begun, he added. 
  Nurmagambetov underlined that Kazakhstan had modern military 
equipment of the Soviet model and did not have to purchase more 
of it. The equipment is served in Kazakhstan on a plant for the 
repairing of defense equipment. In future Kazakhstan will buy 
military equipment only from Russia, Nurmagambetov said.

  [Text] Representatives of Kazakhstan's Ministry for Ecology 
and Biological Resources fear that the shortage of money causes 
delays in commissioning (late 1994) of the first stage of the 
Republic's system of utilization and burial of radioactive 
waste. A spokesman for the Ministry said that the program may 
be hampered by the negative attitude towards it by the heads of 
the regional administrations. For example, only the leadership 
of the Akmolinsk Region gave its consent for burial sites of 
radioactive waste on its territory. 
  This year it is also planned to devise maps of the burial of 
radioactive waste and its sources on the territory of 
Kazakhstan, to take photos and start research studies in the 
area of the Semipalatinsk test ground. The Ministry plans to 
spend 12.04 million tenges (over 414,000 US dlrs) 
  Last year the volume of investments constituted 1.82 million 
tenges (over 384,000 US dlrs as of the date of the introduction 
of the national currency in the republic). However, the general 
contractor responsible for the fulfillment of the radio 
ecological works, the National Nuclear Center of Kazakhstan, 
could not cope with the planned volume of research work due to 
the lack of funds. 
  At present the Republic has a total of 900 enterprises 
polluting the environment and over 75,339 other sources of 
radioactive pollutants.

<F P=106> [Report by Larisa Ivanova under the "Kirgizia" rubric: "TV </F>
Viewers Will See Executions. Republic's Leaders Think This Will 
Help Fight Crime"] 
  [Text] One more nightmarish novelty -- seeing executions 
on your home television -- may soon be added to the horrors 
taking place in the post-Soviet space. The news agency 
POSTFACTUM has learned from unofficial sources close to the 
president's staff that the public relations department has "for 
a long time and seriously" been discussing the possibility of 
such broadcasts on the Republic's television. Should this 
rather extravagant idea be approved by the Republic's 
parliament, the department's staffers would begin drawing up 
corresponding documents. Local observers believe such 
broadcasts would prove to be the biggest "box-office" shows. 
  Major General Sutalinov, the Republic's minister of internal 
affairs, has stated in this regard that in a civilized state 
such educational measures are unacceptable, but "in our bleak 
living even the impossible is possible." "Neighboring Turkmenia 
[Turkmenistan] went for it but it has hardly improved the crime 
situation in the fraternal republic," the general pointed out. 
  This is essentially simply savagery, and it is not going to 
help combat crime a bit. On the contrary, having grown to be a 
customary sight, death would erode the principles of humanism in 
people's minds because violence, even in the form of punishment, 
only breeds violence.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By diplomatic </F>
correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] As INTERFAX learned from Russia's Foreign Ministry, 
the chairman of Tajikistan's parliament, Emomali Rakhmonov, 
arrives in Moscow at about 1530 on Thursday for a one-day 
working visit. 
  "Rakhmonov expressed his wish to come to Moscow to confer 
with President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin long ago," a high-ranking Russian diplomat told 
INTERFAX. 
  According to him, the Tajik leader intends to discuss with 
the Russian premier a package of economic issues. "These will 
include primarily the prospects for Tajikistan's joining the 
ruble area. Judging by the information available to us, Dushanbe 
will accept any conditions advanced by Russia," the diplomat 
said. 
  At his meeting with Yeltsin Rakhmonov will discuss political 
problems, he noted. "As far as we know, Rakhmonov would like to 
discuss with the Russian leader the situation in Tajikistan and 
on the border with Afghanistan," the official said. 
  The draft of a new constitution was published in Tajikistan 
recently, INTERFAX's interviewee said. "The Tajik leadership is 
working on different ways to accomplish reforms, and it would 
like to secure Russia's support in this respect," he said. 
  On Friday Rakhmonov is to confer with the head of Russian 
diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, the diplomat said. The two men will 
focus on problems connected with the inter-Tajik dialogue, the 
first round of which was held in Moscow recently. "Russia is not 
only interested in furthering the talks between the Dushanbe 
government and the Tajik opposition; it intends to nudge the two 
sides toward a political solution to their conflict," he said. 
  INTERFAX's interviewee found it hard to say when and where 
the next round of inter-Tajik talks will take place. "This will 
depend largely on the special envoy of the U.N. secretary 
general for Tajikistan, Piris Ballon, who intends to make a tour 
of the region shortly," he said. "He is likely to choose either 
Tehran or Islamabad."

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Rotar under "Tajikistan" rubric: "More </F>
Casualties on Tajik-Afghan Border. Opposition Seems To Have 
Launched Big Offensive"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] To all appearances, a new 
sharp spiral in the escalation of tensions in Tajikistan is in 
the cards. According to information received from sources close 
to opposition leaders, as many as six Russian border guards, not 
one, were killed in the recent clash along the Tajik border, and 
eight were wounded with two of them being in serious condition. 
The opposition contend that their like-minded associates were 
firing from Tajik territory. According to information from the 
same source, Tajik militants are arriving in great numbers from 
Afghanistan in the Pamirs. Tajik opposition members who live in 
Moscow cannot clearly explain what is happening in their own 
country because communications with their associates from 
Afghanistan have been broken. They think, however, that leaders 
of the Islamic Movement of Tajikistan in Afghanistan have 
decided that Dushanbe has breached the understanding reached 
with the opposition by starting to discuss a new constitution 
before the second round of talks, and has clearly gambled on a 
military solution of the question. Your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent has come to learn that Tajikistan leaders have 
been urgently summoned to Moscow.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe 5 May TASS -- One of the main objectives of 
the current visit to Moscow of the state and government 
delegation from Tajikistan, led by the Republic's leader Emomali 
Rakhmonov is to convince Moscow that it is necessary to speed up 
the process of unification of the monetary systems of Russia and 
Tajikistan, a ranking source in the Tajik Government told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  The Tajik delegation includes Prime Minister Abdudzhalil 
Samadov, Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov, National Bank Chairman 
Kayum Kavmidinov and a large group of experts. According to an 
official version, set forth by Emomali Rakhmonov's press 
secretary Nabi Karimov, the deepening and expansion of bilateral 
political, economic, and military cooperation will be discussed 
with the Russian leadership in Moscow. 
  A Tajik Government official said any further procrastination 
on the process of unification of the monetary systems can lead 
to unpredictable political and economic consequences, since the 
industrial production slump has already reached a critical point 
because of blocked payments and the majority of the population 
have not received pay packets and various social allowances 
since the beginning of the year. 
  Asked whether Tajikistan was planning to introduce temporary 
banknotes for the duration of the transitional period, as 
announced by the prime minister at recent press conference, the 
government official said there was no uniform approach to the 
problem among the Republics leaders. Moreover, Emomali 
Rakhmonov and National Bank Chairman Kayum Kavmidinov are 
against this measure. According to the official the Tajik 
leader will ask Moscow for more Russian cash to last through the 
transition period. 
  Russian journalists at Dushanbe airport were denied even a 
blitz interview with the republic's top leaders before their 
departure for Moscow. Prime Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov said 
all details of the visit will be released to journalists after 
the visit.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the heading "Panorama": "Armed </F>
Forces of Armenia Fired on CSCE Mission"] 
  [Text] On 28 April a delegation of the CSCE [Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe] Minsk Group was fired on by 
the Armenian armed forces in Azerbaijan's Terterskiy Rayon. The 
KHABAR-SERVICE agency learned about this from the UN government 
[as published] in Azerbaijan. By a stroke of luck there were no 
casualties among the members of the delegation. As Minister of 
Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan Hasan Hasanov told a correspondent 
of the KHABAR-SERVICE agency, this happened despite the fact 
that while visiting Yerevan the leader of the delegation, Mr. 
Mathias Mosberg, a deputy of the Minsk Conference [as 
published], informed the leadership of Armenia about a 
forthcoming visit of the mission he heads to Azerbaijan's 
Terterskiy Rayon, which is located in the immediate proximity of 
the front line. It should be stressed that the delegation was in 
the region on a peace-making mission, and the belligerent 
parties had been informed about the future route to be traveled 
by foreign diplomats several days in advance of their arrival. 
After firing on the motorcade of Vladimir Kazimirov, ambassador 
at large of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, this 
winter, the armed forces of Armenia have in this manner now 
expressed their attitude toward the peacemaking efforts of 
intermediaries for the second time.

by Hasan Hasanov to Leaders of a Number of International

  [Text] Minister of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan Hasan 
Hasanov has sent a message to the leaders of a number of 
authoritative international organizations. As the ANS-PRESS 
agency was told by the press service of the foreign policy 
department of the Republic, in the letter Hasan Hasanov stresses 
that such an appeal has been necessitated by numerous 
declarations by the leaders of Armenia to the effect that their 
republic has nothing to do with the Armenian-Azeri conflict. In 
conjunction with this, the minister of foreign affairs of 
Azerbaijan refers to certain facts that testify to the direct 
participation of official Yerevan in the armed aggression 
against the Republic of Azerbaijan. In his letter the head of 
the diplomatic department of the republic gives a chronology of 
combat actions in the zone of the conflict, the response to them 
on the part of international organizations, and facts testifying 
to the direct participation of Armenia in the aggression. "The 
war is being fought on the territory of Azerbaijan by the armed 
forces of Armenia with the use of the separatist forces of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian side is using in combat actions 
heavy materiel covered by the CFE Treaty, under which the 
materiel should be located on the territory of Armenia," says 
the letter. According to the assertions of the head of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, the facts given 
indicate that Armenia has acted from the very beginning as the 
originator, organizer, and key participant in the armed 
aggression against the sovereign state of Azerbaijan.

  [Text] The issue of the route for laying an export pipeline 
will be discussed in Turkey at a meeting between representatives 
of foreign companies and the State Oil Company (GNK) of 
Azerbaijan which belong to a consortium for the joint 
development of the deposits of "black gold" in the republic. A 
KHABAR-SERVICE correspondent learned this from well-informed 
sources in the GNK. A contract on the pipeline might be signed 
after a week of negotiations and mutual accord is achieved. The 
entire management of the GNK will travel to the negotiations, 
which will begin on 2 May. GNK President Natik Aliyev was to 
travel to Turkey yesterday. 
  Let us recall that the contract for laying the export 
pipeline is a separate document whose preliminary signing is 
mandatory for the signing of a contract for the development of 
oil fields between the GNK and foreign companies.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the heading "Panorama": "Oil </F>

  [Text] The volume of oil production at the oil fields 
worked in the Republic has dropped annually by approximately 1 
million tonnes. A correspondent of the KHABAR-SERVICE agency 
learned this from sources in the State Oil Company of 
Azerbaijan. At present annual output stands at the level of 10 
million tonnes a year. This is largely due to the absence of 
necessary production technologies, because those available allow 
for extracting only 65 percent of producible oil. Lack of funds 
for repairs and the technical servicing of drilling rigs is 
another reason. In conjunction with this, about 2,000 wells both 
on land and at sea are completely idle at present.

agency, compared to the previous periods the Azerbaijan 
opposition has sufficiently matured and become more civilized 
and restrained. In the words of Leyla Yunusova, no attempts to 
destabilize the situation in the Republic are being made by the

in political struggle by more civilized and democratic methods. 
According to the NDPA chairman, three main political blocs have 
emerged in Azerbaijan: two oppositional blocs -- the Democratic 
Congress and the Centrist Parties Bloc -- and the third bloc -- 
the leadership of the country. As Leyla Yunusova stressed, there 
are also parties which for one reason or another do not 
subscribe to the points of view of these three associations.

view of a shortage of foreign exchange funds in Iraq, the

the operation of diplomatic missions in [word illegible], 
Hungary, Romania, Poland, India, and a majority of African 
states. With reference to the significance of reinforcing 
Azerbaijani-Iraqi relations, the diplomat expressed the hope 
that the financial situation of his country will shortly make it 
possible to resume operation of the Iraqi Embassy in Baku.

  [Text] Baku, 4 May (AZERTAC)--Manat, Azeri national 
monetary unit seems to undergo the same fate as the Ukrainian 
Karbovanets. The manats exchange rate against the U.S. dollar 
has gone down by 90 per cent and against the Russian ruble by 
2.5 times correspondingly. Thus, today one U.S. dollar costs 
1000 manats and the Russian ruble 0.6 manats. The Azeri 
currency's rapid downfall provoked a feverish mood in the 
country. At Baku's parallel market on Molokanka square, the 
exchange rate of the foreign currency is being updated up to 
three times a day. 
  However, official exchange rates have not been adapted yet. 
According to the information available, the Azeri national bank 
pays 182.5 manats per dollar and 1 manat per 10 Russian rubles. 
That is why the center of currency transactions has moved from 
banking offices at the parallel market. According to 
specialists view, this is one more factor provoking the 
disastrous downfall of the local currency. 
  Azeri experts consider the principal reason of the present 
economic situation the absence of a flexible monetary policy in 
Azerbaijan. Some experts explain this situation by the small 
amount of foreign currency that is being earned by Azerbaijan 
since the Republic's industry has virtually stopped working. 
Moreover, the manat has not become an independent currency and 
its condition depends on fluctuation of rate of exchange of the 
Russian ruble as the national bank has not determined the manats 
real value so far. One of the local televisions observers has 
expressed a very original opinion concerning this situation. He 
explained it by the reason that governmental officers take their 
bribes in freely convertible currency only. However, he may 
guess all too near: Baku newspapers give many examples of this 
kind. 
  Though predictions are dismal -- experts think that dollars 
rate will increase in about 40 per cent every month -- the 
Republic is trying to find the way out from this crisis. 
Abolition of the law of limitation on export of strategic goods 
will undoubtedly provide more constant flow of currency. The 
experts think that the situation might be improved by creation 
of currency exchange offices where monetary transactions will be 
done in accordance with the reasonable rates of currency. The 
experts also say that development of the local industry and 
creation of normal conditions for small enterprises will be more 
effective in this case. 
  However, present monetary and credit crisis resulted in 
retirement of administration of the national bank. Through the 
ever falling manats exchange rate more people live below the 
poverty line. Now 60 per cent of the republics population -- 
about 4 million people -- live in poverty. According to one of 
Baku's newspapers, each of the poor needs 12,600 manats monthly, 
if not to take inflation into consideration, in order to satisfy 
the minimum needs. This amount of money is 70 and 170 per cent 
as much as it was necessary in March and January this year. 
According to Ministry of Labour and Social Security, one 
citizen needs 16 thousand manats for showing a sign of life, it 
is a so-called physiological minimum. 
  Meanwhile, a minimum salary of 900 manats is enough to buy 
half a kilogram of meat. So an average citizen of the Republic 
has to display miracles of resourcefulness in order not to kick 
the bucket.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest incidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  It was hoped that the combat operations would be suspended 
on 
the eve of the meeting the speakers of the parliaments of the 
disputing countries will have. That would give an opportunity 
to the sides to exchange views on what has to be done. 
Regrettably, however, those who cherished that hope have been 
disappointed. The relatively peaceful situation along the front 
lines lasted only 24 hours. Azerbaijan's military forces have 
resumed their intensive military operations in the confrontation 
areas in the NKR. The NKR Defense Army Headquarters Press 
Service has disclosed that Azerbaijan's military units have 
maintained their attacks against various parts of Mardakertskiy 
Rayon. The NKR military units not only obstructed their attacks 
in the clashes in the vicinity of Chayly and Karmiravan but also 
placed several heights under their control. Azerbaijan's 
military units were forced to withdraw to their positions after 
suffering many casualties. 
  Attacks were launched from the military bases in [words 
indistinct] today. The NKR defense forces have successfully 
rebuffed the onslaughts. 
  Using military vehicles, Azerbaijan's military forces tried 
to penetrate the NKR lines close to Agdam yesterday morning. 
However, they failed in their attempt. Their onslaughts were 
obstructed. The advancing units were forced to retreat. 
  It is common knowledge that the neighboring republic's 
leaders are convinced that sending their young men to die is the 
only way to remove the economic crisis in Azerbaijan. However, 
that republic's leaders and reactionary forces are well aware 
that resolving the dispute through the use of armed force is 
impossible. 
  Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's military forces have maintained 
their 
provocative activities on Armenia's border. They intensely 
fired on Armenia's northeastern border with artillery units last 
night and today. The defense positions and residential areas 
close to the border in Noyemberyanskiy, Idzhevanskiy, 
Tavushskiy, and Krasnoselskiy Rayons were fired on with heavy 
artillery units and Grad rocket launchers. The attacks have 
caused damage. Our military units were forced to launch 
retaliatory operations. 
  Two of Azerbaijan's military aircraft flew over the border 
for reconnaissance purposes and disappeared in the direction of 
the Khanlar locality in Azerbaijan at about 1800 yesterday. 
However, the enemy was not satisfied with that provocative 
action. Two enemy infantry groups launched an attack on 
Berkaber in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon at 2200. A wave of intensive 
artillery fire preceded their attack. Armenia's border troops 
forced the Azerbaijani units to retreat after suffering many 
casualties. No one was hurt on the Armenian side. Meanwhile, 
the Armenian fighters clashed with another enemy group close to 
Aygehovit in Idzhevanskiy Rayon. Azerbaijan's troops were 
attacked and forced to retreat. There were dead and wounded on 
both sides.

  [Text] Yerevan 5 May TASS -- As a result of shelling at the 
only operating gas pipeline in Armenia from the territory of 
Azerbaijan, the pipeline was damaged leaving Armenia without 
gas, Roland Adonts, general director of the "Armgazprom" state 
enterprise, told ITAR-TASS. The accident occurred on the 
territory of the frontier Noemberyan district of Armenia where 
specialists from the "Armgazprom" were sent for repairs. 
  Meanwhile, the gas pipeline damage has immediately affected 
the electric power supply of Yerevan and other cities and 
districts of Armenia. Under the transport blockade conditions 
gas is the only fuel for Armenian thermal power stations. 
Therefore, residents of Yerevan are supplied with electricity 
only for one-two hours daily as it was in winter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan by </F>
CLARIN reporter Telma Luzzani in Buenos Aires; date not given] 
  [Text] [Papazyan] Armenia's economy and political life is 
directly affected by the [Nagorno-Karabakh] conflict. For us, a 
peaceful solution to the conflict is of prime importance. There 
are at present two proposals for achieving peace in 
Nagorno-Karabakh: The CSCE proposal and the Russian proposal. 
Armenia has accepted both and what is more, we have convinced 
the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities to accept them too. But do not 
believe it was an easy task. 
  [Luzzani] Why? 
  [Papazyan] Because neither proposal guarantees protection 
for 
the Karabakh population following the peace agreement, and it 
goes without saying that the documents do not talk about the 
enclave's "independence." 
  [Luzzani] Both proposals speak about withdrawal of troops. 
Is Karabakh willing to withdraw from the occupied Azerbaijani 
territory? 
  [Papazyan] One should put that question to Karabakh's 
authorities, but I believe that if they accepted the proposals 
it is because they are willing to withdraw their troops. 
Azerbaijan will also have to withdraw its troops from northern 
Karabakh. The Azerbaijani Government has, however, rejected 
both proposals. 
  [Luzzani] Is there practically no possibility of a 
cease-fire? 
  [Papazyan] I would not say so. Azerbaijan is also steeped in 
a critical situation and sooner or later will have to accept 
that the solution will not be found through military 
intervention. There will come a moment when it will have to 
accept the CSCE's proposal since it does not want Russian troops 
to return to its territory. Ideally, international troops should 
be used to ensure that peace will not be broken. Russia will 
not be able to oppose this. 
  [Luzzani] How are relations between Armenia and Iran at 
present? 
  [Papazyan] Our relations are those of good neighbors. There 
are some problems because the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has 
spread to its boarders and Iran does not like that at all. Iran 
is also interested in a peaceful solution. 
  [Luzzani] And with Turkey? 
  [Papazyan] We do not have diplomatic relations with Turkey, 
which totally closed its border with Armenia and it openly 
promotes Azerbaijani interests. 
  [Luzzani] Does Russia continue to be Armenia's leading 
partner? 
  [Papazyan] Russia is enmeshed in a very serious economic 
crisis. Armenia is Moscow's ally, but the Russian Government 
finds it difficult to provide aid to its allies. Moreover, we 
have very good relations with the EC, the United States, 
Argentina. Our foreign policy is orientated towards a balanced 
opening. 
  [Luzzani] And with the other former Soviet Republics? 
  [Papazyan] Relations with the Ukraine are not as deep as 
they 
should be because Kiev is in an even worse situation than 
Moscow. We have very good relations with republics in Central 
Asia, especially with Turkmenistan. From the economic 
standpoint, I would say our main partners are Russia first, 
followed by Turkmenistan, with Iran in third place.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Trushin] </F>
  [Text] Buenos Aires 5 May TASS -- Armenian Foreign Minister 
Vagan Papazyan announced that "imperial ambitions are alien to 
the Russian leadership. Praising Russian-Armenian relations, he 
said that they are of principal importance in Armenia's foreign 
policy, have historically been "very good," and remain so. 
  "We hope that the democratic changes which have begun on the 
territory of the former Soviet Union will deepen and that, in 
that connection, all such suspicions (of Russian imperialism) 
will disappear," the foreign minister stated. "We need 
partner-like relations, and they have now been established with 
Russia," he told ITAR-TASS in Buenos Aires, where he is on an 
official visit upon the invitation of the Government of 
Argentina. 
  The Armenian foreign minister called for the unification of 
Russian and CSCE efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh 
problem. Both Russia and the European body are trying to unlock 
the Karabakh conflict, but the existence of two separate 
initiatives gives, mostly, Azerbaijan and also, partly, 
Nagorno-Karabakh the freedom to tack between the two sides 
without accepting either proposal, Papazyan said. 
  "Russia needs stability in the Caucasus. Therefore, it seems 
to us, the Russian leadership is sincere in its approach to the 
solution of that conflict," the minister noted. "The most 
rational element in Russia's proposals is that it is impossible 
to achieve a cease-fire without introducing separating forces. 
Nobody except Russia is ready to send their troops into that 
region. The Azerbaijan side has doubts about allowing the 
introduction of Russian troops. However, if that is done in 
cooperation with international institutes such as the CSCE and 
UN, then Azerbaijan will have no grounds for concern," Papazyan 
stressed.

  [Text] An Armenian Foreign Ministry delegation led by 
[Armenian Foreign Minister] Vahan Papazyan arrived in the 
capital of Argentina on 2 May for an official visit. On the 
same day, he met Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. 
Mr. Papazyan noted during the meeting that the agreements 
signed between the two countries on stimulating capital 
investments, on mutual [words indistinct], and on trade and 
economic cooperation serve as a good foundation for the further 
development of the Armenia-Argentine economic cooperation. He 
hoped that the Armenian-Argentine trade and economic symposium 
to open in Buenos Aires soon will give both sides the 
opportunity to reach an agreement on concrete cooperation. 
  In stressing the role of the Armenian community's 
businessmen 
in the economic reform in Argentina, Mr. Cavallo noted the 
importance of their participation in the Armenian-Argentine 
trade and economic cooperation. An agreement was reached to 
send a delegation of the Argentine businessmen to Armenia in the 
near future. 
  Ara Hakobyan, Armenian charge d'affaires ad interim in 
Argentina, was present at the meeting. 
  Also, the Armenian Embassy in Argentina was inaugurated on 2 
May. Vahan Papazyan was present and made the opening speech. 
Argentine officials, representatives of the Armenian community, 
and foreign diplomats were present at the ceremony. 
  The Armenian foreign minister also visited St. Grigor 
Lusavorich Church and placed flowers at the monument to the 
victims of 1915 genocide. Mr. Papazyan also met with the 
Armenian community of Argentina. He informed them about the 
domestic political and economic situation in Armenia and 
detailed Armenia's stance on the settlement of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh problem. Speaking on Armenia's foreign policy 
issues, he emphasized the role of Argentina, which has been 
elected a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, in 
the solution of problems related to the interests of our 
Republic. At the end of the meeting Papazyan replied to 
questions. 
  The Armenian foreign minister met Argentine President Carlos 
Menem and Foreign Minister Guido di Tella on 3 May. 
Armenian-Argentine interstate agreements were signed.

<F P=106> [Report by Gevorg Gazaryan on news conference held by Vice </F>
President Gagik Arutyunyan in Yerevan on 5 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Gazaryan] An Armenian delegation headed by the 
Republic's Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan paid a two-day visit 
to Iran. The delegation returned last night, and today the head 
of the delegation briefed reporters on the high-level contacts 
during which matters pertaining to the activation of 
Armenian-Iranian ties were discussed. 
  Mr. Arutyunyan said that the construction of the bridge 
[over 
the Araks River] will also start on the Iranian bank of the 
river. A new highway to Tehran is being planned, in which the 
Armenian workers will participate. Agreements were concluded on 
expanding the volume of future work. The 
Turkmenistan-Iran-Armenia power line was also discussed. The 
sides considered it necessary to activate the border trade. 
However, at present, the most important issue is regulating the 
border crossing for civilians. The Iranian side was also 
interested in Armenia's information on the Iranian plane crash. 
Taking this opportunity, Mr. Arutyunyan also briefed us on the 
information available to him. 
  [Arutyunyan] In order to assess and arrive at conclusions at 
least the following six questions must be answered: 
  1. What should the relevant Moscow services have done but 
failed to do? As already documented, 50 minutes into the flight 
from Moscow airport, the plane sharply lost altitude by 400 
meters because of [words indistinct] near [name indistinct] 
settlement. It refused to return to Moscow airport and continued 
its flight. It must be clearly determined what the technical 
condition of the plane was before departing Moscow [words 
indistinct]. 
  2. What should the relevant services in Georgia have done 
but failed to do, or did them incorrectly? This too must be 
determined, because according to records, the air traffic 
controllers contacted the plane and gave it instructions and 
fixed its coordinates. There are points here that need to be 
further clarified. There is a need for a specialized 
investigation of these records. 
  3. What should the relevant Armenian services have done but 
failed to do, or did them incorrectly? According to our 
information, the Armenian services were in constant contact with 
the Georgian services and with the plane through a Russian plane 
[words indistinct]. We must find definitive answers to all 
these questions. 
  4. What could the relevant Karabakh services have done but 
failed to do? 
  5. What should the relevant Azerbaijani services have done 
but failed to do [words indistinct]? 
  6. And finally, what should have been done but was not done 
properly or was done incorrectly by the plane's crew [words 
indistinct]? 
  A final conclusion can be reached only after finding answers 
to these six questions. 
  Having familiarized itself with our position and [words 
indistinct], the Iranian side concluded that the investigative 
work should continue to find answers to all these questions, and 
based on these answers, to arrive at a conclusion without any 
intention of using this accident for political purposes or for 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Gazaryan] At the end of the news conference, the Armenian 
Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan replied to reporters' questions.

  [Text] After May 30 Russian strategic nuclear-armed 
missiles will not be targeted against sites situated on the 
territory of the United States and Great Britain, 
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces 
Colonel General Igor Sergeyev reported to Interfax on Thursday. 
  In his words, the missiles which were earlier targeted 
against the United States and Great Britain, will not be 
targeted against any site in the world. Sergeyev reported that 
earlier the command considered the possibility of re-targeting 
strategic missiles at points in the open sea. "However, we have 
chosen not to target them at any point," he said. 
  Sergeyev pointed out that non-targeting of Russian missiles 
is being implemented in accordance with the Declaration on 
Organization of Daily Activity of Strategic Nuclear Forces with 
Non-Targeted Missiles signed by Russian and American Presidents 
Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton on January 14, 1994 in Moscow. 
On February 14 Boris Yeltsin and British Prime Minister John 
Major signed a joined statement on joining this Declaration. 
  Sergeyev expressed conviction that by May 30 American and 
British strategic missiles would "not be targeted against 
Russian sites either." 
  "This will raise the threshold of nuclear security in the 
world," Sergeyev asserts.

  [Text] Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council, 
Valeriy Manilov, suggested that the next meeting of the Security 
Council planned for May was likely to focus on issues concerning 
the Russian borders. 
  He said at a press conference today that this was one of the 
priorities when ensuring Russia's security. 
  The second important problem was the Russian brain drain, he 
emphasized. Manilov stressed that the Security Council was 
trying to solve the problem by non-standard ways with the 
participation of all interested organizations. 
  Manilov suggested that threats to Russia could stem from the 
economic problems, inter-ethnic relations within the Russian 
Federation and possible social-economic collisions due to the 
growing unemployment. 
  Manilov announced that the Russian Security Council had 
recommended that all the interested departments work on problems 
concerning Russia joining the NATO Partnership for Peace 
program. This analysis and specific proposals on the issue are 
expected to be submitted to the Security Council in June. 
  The issue on the joint U.S.-Russian military exercise in the 
Southern Urals (the Totsk training ground) was also carefully 
worked on. Manilov said when discussing this both moral and 
economic factors must be taken into consideration. 
  Manilov said the Security Council was preparing radical 
proposals on the Black Sea Fleet issue to prevent it becoming a 
real danger. "I think the Russian and Ukrainian presidents will 
adopt mechanisms for making the final decision on this issue in 
the interests of the two countries and their peoples," Manilov 
emphasized.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov and Mikhail </F>

  [Text] Moscow, 6 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian Federation 
Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev plans to outline 
Russia's new approaches to the "Partnership for Peace" program 
in Brussels on 24 May. He stated this at a news conference at 
the Russian Defense Ministry today. 
  In his words, Russia should put out its own idea of 
partnership. Before 15 May a group of Russian scientists should 
draw up proposals on this issue, they will be then examined at a 
meeting of the Security Council. If they are approved, the 
Russian proposals will be announced to NATO defense ministers by 
Pavel Grachev at the NATO headquarters. 
  The minister said that what is proposed in the "Partnership 
for Peace" program does not entirely suit Russia. "The role of 
NATO and the West European Union is increasing, but they do not 
have the right to substitute the peacekeeping functions of the 
CSCE and ignore Russia's interests," Pavel Grachev believes. 
  Pavel Grachev also said that he discussed issues relating to 
Russia's new proposals to the "Partnership for Peace" program 
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

  [Text] Head of the General Headquarters of the Russian 
Armed Forces Mikhail Kolesknikov said that Russia is ready to 
launch a first space ship from a base of the missile complex 
located in the town of Svobodny-18 (the Amur region) in 1996, 
and to carry out manned flights in the future. Speaking to 
journalists in Moscow on Wednesday he noted that extra funds 
would not be needed for these purposes. 
  Kolesnikov said that despite positive progress in talks with 
the Kazakh side on the use of the Baykonur cosmodrome, a lot of 
problems remain unresolved. At the same time he noted that 
"today it is impossible to pretend that we do not need Baykonur." 
  Answering questions, Kolesnikov spoke in favor of holding 
Russian-American military exercises on the Totsk test ground of 
the Orenburg region this summer. He expressed regret that this 
issue "caused heated debate" in the State Duma. "They will be 
command post exercises, and not a single American tank will roll 
on the Totsk test ground," he said. 
  Kolesnikov said that by the beginning of this year the 
Russian Armed Forces numbered 2,300,000 military servicemen. He 
also said that by January 1, 1995, it is planned to reduce the 
armed forced down to less than 2 million. He said that 
currently the armed forces are recruited to 62 percent of 
capacity. He suggested that after the spring draft the figure 
will remain the same.

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report in the "Russian-U.S. Military </F>
Cooperation" column: "Pavel Grachev Finds the Exercises a Hard 
Test"] 
  [Text] The cancellation of Russian-U.S. military exercises 
in Orenburg Oblast can damage both Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev's international prestige and his positions within 
Russia. Whether the exercises in Orenburg Oblast will go ahead 
after all may become clear at the end of consultations of 
Russian and U.S. military working groups which opened in Moscow 
yesterday. 
  The noise around the exercises is in fact of an exclusively 
political character. It is hard to believe that the tent camp 
which was to be made for 210 Americans on the territory of the 
27th Motorized Division stationed in the area of Totsk can cause 
irreparable ecological damage. Likewise it is hard to see the 
presence of 200 men and officers from the U.S. Army as a real 
threat to Russia's national security. 
  Apparently State Duma deputies, protesting against the 
conduct of joint exercises, have decided to use the planned 
one-week presence of the U.S. military on Russia's territory for 
far more serious purposes. 
  What is at issue is apparently the figure of the defense 
minister himself. First of all, because many deputies cannot 
forgive him the tanks on Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya last 
October. Furthermore, anyone from the presidential entourage is 
a "red rag" to the opposition. Especially a power minister. 
Pavel Grachev's political independence and influence seem no 
longer to suit not only the opposition but even some people in 
the presidential team. Even such a presidential structure as 
the Security Council has come out against the minister on the 
side of the State Duma. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned, the 
council apparatus has prepared a memorandum for Boris Yeltsin 
that talks about the inexpediency of inviting the Americans to 
Russia. 
  Meanwhile, for Pavel Grachev, who likes to accentuate his 
successes in relations with "distant foreign lands," the first 
Russian-U.S. exercises on Russian soil were to mark not only a 
transition to a new stage of cooperation with the United States. 
They were to consolidate his image as a serious politician, 
capable of pursuing an independent line. Cancellation of the 
exercises can damage the minister's authority with foreign 
colleagues and put into question the durability of his position 
in the upper echelons of the Russian power structure. To be 
sure, this will not force the defense minister to resign. Yet 
it is just as obvious that the first crack in his status will 
appear. If Pavel Grachev fails to defend the idea of joint 
maneuvers, this will indicate that the general, who is part of 
the presidential inner circle, is not so influential and 
invulnerable after all, and will increase the opposition's wish 
to knock a strong figure from the presidential team. Therefore 
it can be assumed that criticism over the maneuvers will be 
followed by more serious attacks. 
  It is also noteworthy that almost at the same time an attack 
was launched on another power minister, also close to the 
president: Viktor Yerin. When discussing the assassination of 
Andrey Ayzderzis, deputies demanded Yerin's resignation. 
  Presumably, taught by bitter experience, the president's 
opponents are now afraid of attacking him directly. They 
undertake a bypassing maneuver, trying to shake Boris Yeltsin's 
main props. Surely, the likelihood that he will soon replace the 
proven power ministers is negligible. By discrediting people 
close to the president step by step, however, the opposition can 
finally compel Yeltsin to part with them. Moreover, the 
president's opponents do not even need to place their people in 
the vacant posts: After all the new figures, even if appointed 
by Yeltsin himself, will hardly strengthen him.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Vladimir Semenov by </F>
Aleksandr Sidyachko under the "Hello!" rubric: "Peacekeepers 
Getting Ready for Battles"] 
  [Text] The Russian-American peacekeeping forces exercises 
scheduled for July at the Totsk training ground of Orenburg 
Oblast are under threat of disruption. The State Duma has asked 
Yeltsin "to look into the question of the wisdom of the 
exercises," and the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry 
has been asked to think of holding maneuvers on the territory of 
a NATO state. The Russian Federation president, according to 
his press service's report, treated with "understanding the 
parliamentarians' arguments" and recommended to the military to 
hold additional consultations with the Americans "taking account 
of both the postures of the Russian lawmakers and those voiced 
by the public in this connection." OBSHCHAYA GAZETA 
correspondent Aleksandr Sidyachko called Colonel General 
Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of Russia's ground forces, 
to ask for his comments on the situation that has taken shape 
around holding this operation. 
  [Sidyachko] Vladimir Magomedovich, the top lawmakers were 
especially angered at the fact that the exercises are being 
planned on the territory of Russia. They are inclined to 
interpret them as a rehearsal of America's future invasion.... 
  [Semenov] During last spring's Vancouver meeting of the 
presidents of Russia and the United States, an agreement was 
reached on joint peacekeeping actions of the two countries. 
Then the Americans proposed, within the framework of military 
cooperation, to hold a peacekeeping exercise on their territory. 
But we declined. It would have taken several million dollars to 
move the men and equipment across the ocean. We do not have the 
money. As for a NATO country, we proposed this option to 
Germany, where the U.S. 3d Infantry Division is stationed. The 
Germans declined. And then we made a decision to hold the 
exercises on the training ground of the 27th Russian 
Peacekeeping Division in Totsk. 
  [Sidyachko] The majority of Duma men hold the opinion that 
America is to pay all the exercise expenses for Russia. And 
it's you pay your money, you takes your choice, you know.... 
  [Semenov] This is not so. The Americans are to pay all the 
expenses involved in the participation in the exercises of the 
3d Infantry Division, food, renting the airfield, the landing of 
planes with equipment included. As far as our 27th division is 
concerned, these maneuvers were included in the combat training 
plan as early as last year. Thus each pays only for himself. 
  [Sidyachko] Why these exercises at all? 
  [Semenov] I want to specially underline: they are going to 
be command and staff exercises. More than 250 men are to take 
part in them on each side. The Russian Armed Forces are to 
contribute the staff of the 589th Motorized Rifle Regiment of 
the 27th Division, the staff of the 2d Motorized Rifle Battalion 
and one of its companies. The U.S. Armed Forces are to 
contribute the staff of the 1st Brigade of the 3d Infantry 
Division (20 men), the staff of the 1st Battalion of the 15th 
Infantry Regiment (20 men), and Company "C" (101 men). The 
equipment includes 50 wheeled vehicles and about 20 trailers. 
No tanks, armored vehicles, field guns, and mortars are to be 
used. 
  The objective of the exercises is to forge common approaches 
to the planning and conduct of peacekeeping operations, to 
practice the mechanism of coalition peacekeeping troop control. 
The Americans have vast experience in holding such operations. 
They will demonstrate the technique of separating feuding 
sides, share their experience in escorting humanitarian freight, 
in the performing of joint duties at checkpoints, in the 
provision of aid to refugees. Today the world body has 
recognized two types of peacekeeping actions: operations in 
enforcing peace (for example, NATO bombing in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina; they, as experience shows, are not effective -- 
A.S.) and peacekeeping operations where all violence toward the 
indigenous population is ruled out. Practicing the second 
option is indeed the objective of the upcoming exercises. 
  [Sidyachko] In the wake of the Duma's statement on where it 
stands in regard to the exercises, how could you argue for the 
need to hold them? 
  [Semenov] The United States justly believes that Russia will 
also in the future have its interests in many regions in the 
world and seek to exercise its influence on them. And here the 
best way out would be to look for compromise solutions rather 
than a standoff that will not benefit any side.
